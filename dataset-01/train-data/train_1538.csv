5,Brothers Keeper,This is one of the most wonderful films I have ever seen. Why it was not given the academy award for best documentary the year of it's release I'll never know. This film will captivate you from begining to end. This is a sad yet masterfully told story of a simple people who by the death of a brother are propelled into the not so simple world of the judicial system. It is also a feel good story of a town who will do most anything to back their own. Im sure after seeing this Documentary you will be as moved as I was.
2,A little too weird.,Couldn't relate. Not my kind of entertainment. Not much evidence given one way or the other. Also seemed a little too amateurish.
3,"Oh, Dear!","I do tend to like documentaries; however, this one had me wanting to shower and clean my home about every 20 minutes. It was also an extremely slow unfoldment of the information ... Sorry! I have too few words for a movie that belied the title. Were these brothers really their brother's keeper or just simple men for whom life's events just unfolded as they were meant to unfold?"
3,My Brother's Keeper,It might be a great documentary. However I found this film to be too depressing for me to view all of it.
3,Interesting movie,"It gave me a view of a society I know nothing of (being a City kid). And I felt sorry for the protagonist accused. But it did not ""grab"" me."
3,power failure night light,We have 3 different brands of night / flash lights.This unit works as advertised but gives the least light of the three.I recommend checking out other brands.
1,Great Idea... Poor execution,I bought the item at a local drug store cause I needed a nightlight and figured a backup light would be great too. Well it works fine as a nightlight. But the first time we lost power the unit failed to turn on leaving us completely in the dark to find a flashlight. There's a switch to turn on or off the back up light. But the unit simply didn't not work without power.
1,I tried...,"I tried to stick with this book, hoping it would get better, but I finally gave up on page 87. The story made no sense in a lot of ways, the heroine kept doing stupid stuff and I didn't like the hero at all. I really like Meagan McKinney's books, usually -- what a BIG disappointment."
3,Too Long & Too Boring,"I have been doing Leslie's workouts for a few years and I really enjoy them. The 3 mile workouts were getting easy so I thought I'd try this one.Although it is a good workout, the movements get tedious. She doesn't introduce enough variation to really get you into this workout. I found myself looking at the clock wondering how long until I could stop.I recommendation is to stick to the 3 mile workouts. The only thing this one does is increase your stamina."
2,Not much of an aerobic workout for me!,"I'm a bit surprised by all the 5-star reviews here because this video just did not give me an aerobic workout. I'd consider myself an intermediate level exerciser (I usually work out to Cathe or Beachbody videos) and I bought this video because I thought it would be a good video for a ""light"" day. I always wear a heart-rate monitor during my workouts and, when I used this video, I was always way below my aerobic zone, even when I used weights and did exaggerated movements. So my advice is to only buy this video if you're a beginner; intermediate and advanced exercisers will probably want something more intense."
5,This is the one I always come back to!,"Though this is a long one, I do it as part of a several work out rotation at least once a week. The mileage graph seems slow at the beginning, but once you get passed the first mile, it seems to move more quickly. It is one good work out!"
4,Intense workout,"Very good, very intense workout. I've got about 8 of Leslie Sansone's DVDs now. I use this one about once a week because it is longer than the others (60 min) and because I'm usually drenched with sweat at the end of it. It's got her core moves (marching, kicks, side steps, knee lifts), but she has jazzed things up a bit. It's a good pace and a great workout.It would be nice though for her production company to improve the features on the DVD though (no menus is one thing). The meter only shows up after each mile and that can be a little discouraging.My only complaints about the workout itself is that there's not as much concentration on the arms and that the stretching is less than adequate."
3,not enough of a workout,"I bought the DVD based on other customer reviews and was very disappointed. Following the birth of my daughter, I had gained an extra 50Ibs and would describe myself as extremely unfit. I was able to do the complete 4 miles relatively easily without building much a sweat....and believe me I was pushing myself. I think the excercise program would only be ok if combined with other regimens....I did a 3 mile run afterwards since I was on an exercise ""high""....now that built up alot of sweat....save your money and walk round the block!!!"
1,Leslie Sansone - Walk Away the Pounds Express - Super Challenge,"This review is based on the condition of the CD itself. I'm sure this is a very good walking exercise CD, however, I had 2 CD's shipped and neither one would play. It seemed that the CD was warped or otherwise damaged. So, I never got to use it as I gave up on having any more shipped to me."
3,"Won't necessarily make you lose weight, but a fun walk.","If you are in pretty good shape, I highly doubt this DVD will make you really ""walk away the pounds"". I weigh 130 and am 5'4"", and my heart rate didn't get any higher than when I walk around in the mall.However, I will say that Leslie Sansone is very encouraging and authentic in this dvd. If you are just looking to get a little more healthy and mobile, or just starting to get into working out, this is a great introduction to getting moving. However, if you are hoping to see home drastic changes in your body, from MY personal experience, this is not necessarily the way to go."
4,Walk Away the Pounds 4-mile,"I wanted something a little more intense in my Walk Away the Pounds video collection. This 4mile walk definantely is intense and I was sore for a few days. If you are looking for something ""more"" here it is. However I did not like the fact that she didn't use weights in this video and the setting was very impersonal and intimidating. The set was a steel gray and all the people were in very good shape which made it seem like this video wasn't for everyone."
5,Best exercise tape I've found.,"I started doing Leslie's tapes again two months ago. I had 3 of her other videos and ordered two more. This one is by far the very best. I especially like that there is no apparatus; it's a great cardio workout without the unneccesary frill, and it will make you sweat, sweat, sweat. In the last year, I have gone through surgery and chemo, and been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. If this former couch potato can do this workout anyone can - except my 27-year-old granddaughter. Sbe's only made it through the first two miles.People complain about Leslie's talking, but it's really not too bad, and you can tune her out after awhile. Another critism I've read is that not everyone is using the right form. So what. If you know what to do, do it."
5,Great workout!,"I love this workout. Leslie Sansone is very upbeat, and so are the other walk leaders in the workout. The pace is extremely brisk - including warm-up and cool-down, the entire four miles only takes 60 minutes. I'm very un-coordinated, so I really appreciate this good aerobic workout that doesn't require complicated moves but still has me sweating buckets."
5,The Ultimate BEST...,"It's the best fitness video you will ever buy... The moves are easy, Leslie is super.I love doing this 4 miles, I cannot wait for her 5 miles. If you have just one video to buy,this is truly THE ONE..."
4,Low impact exercise DVD,"Easy to follow,low impact exercise. Great for at home,getting into shape,weight loss. This is a four mile ""Walk away the Pounds Express"" DVD by Leslie Sansone. I have some of her other DVD's,and switch back and fortheach time I exercise to keep the motivation going. You are able to go at your own pace and stop when you want.I like that."
5,LOVE IT!!!,I love this video. It's one of my favorites! Even if I am tired I love to do this video. I feel so much better afterwards. I even did this when I was heavier and out of shape. I would recommend this video to EVERYONE! I love Leslie's positive and encouraging attitude!!! :)
5,Love this 4 mile walk!,"I have been doing Leslie's workouts for a year now. Most of that time I did the 2 mile walk and about 3 months ago or so started the 3 mile. I really liked the 3 mile, but decided that I needed to change it up a little because it wasn't challenging anymore. So I ordered this DVD and it is fantastic!!! Love the music in this one, it really makes you want to move. She does talk a little much, but I just try to concentrate on the music. Although, she is a very motivating person and really makes you want to work and get healthy. Another thing I like about this video is to see someone sweat! In the other ones that I have not one person drops a bead of sweat, they don't even shine a little bit and in this one someone is sweating. Makes me feel like I'm not alone as I'm sweating like crazy. :) This video along with her Walk and Kick, Pilates and her Walkblaster really gives variety and I'm so thankful to have found her videos!!! Thank you Leslie Sansone!"
5,Yeah for Leslie!!,"I am a former couch potato that had not exercised in 10 years, I made a commitment for this to be the year that my family and I finally get in better shape. My friend Tiffany gave me a copy of the 3 mile WATP tape I started out doing it once a day and really liked how positive Leslie is and the convience of doing the workouts on my own time at home. In a couple of weeks I noticed the pounds started to come off. I was very excited when I saw the 4 mile DVD advertised and could not wait to get it. The tape is very upbeat and fast paced. You will certainly work up a sweat!! I have been working out for almost 3 months and have lost *40 pounds* durning that time. If you are willing to make the commitment to GET MOVING you will feel better, sleep better, and feel healthier than ever...even if you don't always eat the ""right"" things!!!"
5,Awesome!,"I have used this program before and was not disappointed. I needed a new DVD and it has given me the new ""zip"" that I needed to get started again. Thanks Leslie!!"
5,CONVIENIENT AND MOTIVATING,I LOVE THE THREE TAPE SET OF WALK AWAY THE POUNDS. I AM A KINDERGARTEN SHOOL TEACHER AND YOU WOULD THINK I WOULD GET ENOUGH EXECISE JUST DOING THAT. I AM MENTALLY DRAINED BY THE END OF THE DAY TRYING TO STAY A STEP AHEAD OF THE LITTLE ONES. WALK AWAY THE POUNDS IS FUN AND EASY....IT TAKES HARDLY ANY THINKING SKILLS TO USE THIS TAPE YET IT GIVES AN EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE WORKOUT. IT IS SO CONVIENIENT I DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE IF I DON'T WANT TO. I CAN WALK AWAY THE POUNDS IN MY LIVING ROOM AND WALK RIGHT TO THE SHOWER AND RELAX! I LOVE IT!
5,I Love Leslie,"Anything that Leslie Sansone does is amazing! This is the prime of prime! You feel this one, but you also feel totally energized when it's done. Leslie, keep them coming!"
5,Fast workout,"I got this because I have several other DVDs by Leslie. I love her high energy, and this one doesn't disappoint. Fast-paced, but you don't ever actually run or jog in place. One reason I really liked it is because it's 4 continuous miles (no costume or cast changes between the miles)."
5,"Love this, when I have an extra hour!","This is a 58 minute workout. (The 3 mile walk is 48 minutes, might as well do the 4 mile!) I love to do it in the mornings before work, helps me feel energized all day. It goes by in a flash, too. Of all the express videos, this is my favorite. If you're just starting out, I'd recommend working your way up to this one. But if you've been walking or otherwise exercising for a while, this is a great video to boost you!"
5,Leslie Rocks,"I've been using Leslie's workout videos for years and I believe the 4 mile super challenge is her best so far. If you're just starting to exercise again or you're out of shape you might want to start with mile 1 or 2 but if you feel that you need a bigger challenge, that is fun and very motivating, mile 4 super challenge is for you. The music helps you keep a fast pace, Leslie's postive attidude keeps you from wanting to quit, and the exercises throughout the program are so simple that anyone with two left feet can do them. I own several of the Walk Away the Pounds videos because I can mix and match the different miles and create my own exercise program. These are wonerful videos and anyone who wants a workout that is challenging but easy to follow should try them in a heartbeat."
4,love it,"I start walking using Leslie tapes and I love them. I love her encouraging talks she give through-out the work out. It's not overly taxing but does give a good workout. I am 6 months pregnant and I am feeling pretty darn good. I hope to continue with this dvd for the next three months!I alternate this dvd with another one of Leslie workouts. I try to fit in a mile in the morning. I find the more I exercise the better I am feeling!I had to find something low impact, but yet fast enough to help with my circulation. Swimming seemd like a good option, but then again it's a big pain to haul myself there. Here with the dvd's I have the convenience to exercising when I want and even how long. She gives the option of 1 mile, 2mile...ect. I feel pretty good saying, ""oh yeah, I walked 4 miles today!""."
3,Pooh's review,"I like Leslie's workouts. I like the fact that this is 4 miles, but I like her WATP 2 pak DVD whick has a 1, 2 and 3 mile walk in the set. The 2 pak uses weights. This 4 mile walk does not use weights. All in all, good purchase to have to change your routine."
2,They weren't joking about the screeching noise!,"I bought this cordless vacuum after a number of recommendations from folks. Prior to my purchase I read some reviews and noticed that a number of people took issue with the loudness of the vacuum when it is in use. I figured they were being overly sensitive, so I put in my order without much concern.Fast forward to when I received the product and tried it out. After charging the battery and firing the vacuum up I was shocked at how loud and piercing the shrill noise is. I already have hearing damage as it is and I feel that if I were to use this vacuum without shooting earmuffs I would further damage my hearing. It really is unbelievable how high-pitched of a shriek this product has.That being said, the vacuum does an excellent job of cleaning and has great suction power. I just wish it didn't give me a raging headache every time I used it."
2,Poor suction,Definitely not a dyson. This vac sucks. But not like its supposed to. Would not recommend. I do have one for sale if your still interested.
3,Incredible racket nearly ruins this otherwise great vac,"You really can't use this vac without ear protection. Believe me, I give you 20 seconds and you will be covering one ear with your free hand and trying to hunch your shoulder up to cover your other ear, and that won't work very well. Other people have pointed out lamely that it's not that much louder than other shop vacs. Maybe, but it does have a higher pitched whine. And you'll be a lot closer to this vac because it's handheld and has a short hose. You can't get away from it.A lot of other reviewers have pointed out the good points, which I agree with. I like the DW 18V batts, they are awesome batteries. So I'll keep using this vac, because it's useful and I've got 3 of the batteries and 4-5 other tools that use the batteries. BUT. I keep meaning to buy a set of ear muff style hearing protectors to hang next to it. I'm not kidding. You will damage your ears if you use this without earplugs.Badly flawed product."
1,Incredibly noisy,The noise is very high pitched and practically made my family's ears bleed. Ear protection mandatory when using this product.
5,dewalt,very good it is very strong and powerful to pull from dust up to water and leaves my car looking clean
4,DEWALT DC515K Heavy Duty 1/2 Gallon 18-Volt Ni-Cad,I BOUGHT IT FOR MY HUSBAND HE DRIVES A MINING TRUCK. HE SAYS IT HAS GREAT SUCTION POWER. THE ONLY PROBLEM HE HAS IS THE ON & OFF SWITCH HIS FINGERS HIT IT AND TURNS IT OFF. THE ON & OFF SWITCH SHOULD BE IN A DIFFERENT SPOT. OTHER THEN THAT VERY GREAT ITEM.
2,dewalt dc 515k,"Great price for what you get, vacuum, battery and charger. Picked up good in car, would be nice with a better attachment on the end. I gave it as a gift but he didn't like it because doesn't hold charge long at all 15 minutes. I wouldn't recommend for someone who doesn't have an extra battery handy to change. I would recommend over the Dyson I heard that only last 5 minutes. Bottom line good if you have extra battery."
5,Dewalt Vac,"This is a powerful vac, a little on the noisy side and it is pricey. It was exactly what I wanted and I am very pleased with this product, it fits the bill for me."
4,This thing is LOUD!,"I purchased this portable vacuum to add to my collection of 18v Dewalt power tools. It is nice to use to clean up small messes in the garage and around the house without having to pull out the larger canister or shop vac. The suction of this portable does not compare to that of the larger corded vacs in my opinion but that does not usually matter for small jobs.One thing I did not expect is the noise level of this vacuum, it is very LOUD!!! I feel like I should be wearing hearing protection when running it! The high pitch whine when running is very intense and I usually will try to position myself relative to the vacuum in such a way as to try to reduce the noise hitting my ears. This is its only flaw in my opinion. I may just invest in some inexpensive hearing protectors.Build quality seems to be very good, as most Dewalt tools are."
4,"Good, but not exceptional","Because it was a DeWalt, and rather pricey, I bought this unit expecting it to basically be a hand-held Shop-Vac, which is not quite the case. I suspect that my expectations were too high. It will easily lift all kinds of wood and metal chips, even fairly heavy ones, off a smooth surface, but if you're trying to get a winter's worth of grit out of your car carpets, a plug-in shop-vac still does a better job...."
5,Powerful For A battery Powered Unit,"Reasonably light though also relatively bulky compared to my older Ryobi vacuum. It does hold a lot more before requiring emptying and has a much finer pore filter so it stops more fine dust.One thing not noted in the other reviews I have read on it concerns the criticism noted of the suction nozzle being fixed to the body. The hose diameter is such that when the nozzle end is pulled out of the nozzle, 1.25"" diameter standard shop vacuum accessories can be attached to the hose end. Thus it can be used with standard 1.25"" nozzles including wand, flared nozzle and brush accessories and extensions for floor cleaning. This capability adds considerably to the unit's versatility.It is loud compared to other battery powered vacuums but that is my primary criticism so far."
2,get the other dewalt vac,"I have purchased many dewalt tools. I have only been disappointed with this one. It is VERY loud. Also, it has almost no suction. Good news is it comes with a battery and charger. So it isnt a total waste of money."
4,great little vacuum,finally broke down and bought one of these and it's already been hard at work in my house! good price & quick delivery
5,Excellent handheld vac,"I just bought this on sale at Lowe's for $99. The battery and charger alone separately are over $100 so this struck me as a deal. This thing is like a dustbuster on steroids. I use it to pick up stray leaves and other garbage that finds it's way around the house, and it puts every other handheld vac to shame. It's not as light as your average handheld due to the big battery, but boy does it pick stuff up. Loud? Nah. Louder than a dustbuster but not unbearable, especially considering the job it does. I have big shop vacs also, but this one is just so handy for little jobs, and the battery also goes into the 2 gal Dewalt I have which is great for the car, boat, airplane, whatever. If you're looking for something handy and powerful for small jobs around the house, this is the gizmo. You won't regret it."
3,Needs a crevice adapter,"All of my cordless tools are deWalt, so it's nice being able to share batteries.I've been using it for about 1 year.Here's what I like about it:1. strong suction2. easy to clean3. batteries last long (at least compared to a Craftsman vac I had)Here's what I don't like about it:1. no crevice tool, nor is it an option. I've even tried looking for another brand, in the hopes I could use it on the DeWalt.2. Without the crevice tool I've been unable to clean out things like elevator tracks.3. It's the best out there but that's only because the other ones just aren't that good.4. why the heck they didn't include a crevice adapter is a mystery.5. I would have given it an 90 out of 100 (A-) with a crevice tool but I'm giving it a 74 without it (C)."
2,"A lot of sound and fury, not much vacuum","Given the size of the this vacuum, the huge battery, and the truly hellacious *sound*, you'd expect an equally impressive amount of suction -- able to lift bowling balls, or pluck hummingbirds out of the air or, I dunno, actually clean the sand out of my car's nooks and crannies. But no, despite all the noise (which really does require hearing protection), the suction ability on this vacuum is quite disappointing and it gets rapidly worse as the filter collects dust. It's just about adequate for cleaning up kitty litter around the pan, but even a $29.00 cordless vac can do that. Even the shape of the hose is wrong for getting into tight areas.The only positive thing I have to say about this vacuum is that it looks very impressive."
2,Decent quality but unreliable in the long term,I have owned and used this printer for a little over a year and printed under 100 discs with it. The quality isn't stunning but certainly acceptable and better than using stickers or markers. Mine died today and I have found that most reputable retailers have stopped selling it precisely for its short lifespan.
1,Do not buy!,"Do not buy this printer. It only printed 20 cds before the cartridge ran out. Only about half of those fully printed. If your cd isn't perfectly, I mean perfectly flat there will be low spots the printer head won't cover. The software is a joke. You cannot do anything creative. I am sending it back and all the cd's I bought."
1,Piece of junk,"Spend your money on an ink jet printer that will print discs. This printer skips and leaves gaps. Fine font is not legible. It will print on only 4 sectors on the disc, not the entire disc."
1,ninja tune should look for something else,"i've been trying to dig on this single for a while, but i can only say it is straight up wack. i suppose it is good to see ninja tune willing to experiment with some new ideas, but fusing indie rock with hip-hop/turntablism/leftfield is not well done here. whiny flaming lips like vocals drone over some minorly adjusted beats to create a piece of noise i really didn't enjoy. even coldcut's remix couldn't save it. 'moon repellent', the b-side track, was only marginally better, but still not something that is well done. try again, ninja tune."
4,British 70s Funk!,"I'm one of those people who loves to collect things from all over the world. So one can imagine the delight I felt upon finding this musical gem. Our funk brothers from accross the pond found excellent continuity with us here in the colonies. Conceivably, one could leave a party in New York, fly to London and pickup right where one left off. But, I digress. This is fine funk is reminiscent of Brass Construction, Mass Production, early Commodores, Rufus and a whole host of other hot horn sectioned, jam bands of the 70s and early 80s. What is more, there are early elements of one of my favorite British bands, Incognito. Two funky feet stompin' the floor for this one!"
1,POTENTIAL BUYERS BEWARE!,"The movie company that distributes this disc in North America has created an entire lot of defective Blu-ray discs: You'll find a standard DVD inside the blu-ray case when you open it.I've been through two of these from Amazon, so far. I'm giving up and buying the UK blu-ray disc, instead, since I have a multi-region blu-ray player."
5,Great Shoe,I have had these shoes for more than 6 months and wear them approximate 3 days a week and they are very comfortable and are holding up great and are very stylish. I will buy another pair if they are available when the time comes.
1,Comfy but doesn't last long,"These are very comfortable shoe, but won't last long. Leather begin to wrinkle & crack in couple of months."
1,Not made very well,I have had these shoes for 6 months. The bottms of the shoes have holes worn in them. I have never worn a hole in the bottom of a shoe before.
2,NOT THAT PLEASED,ITS SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT FOR STYLE AND COMFORT BUT ON BOTH ACCOUNTS IT IS LACKING. THE STYLE IS WEAK AND COMFORT IS PRACTICALY NON EXISTENT. I HAD TO TAKE OUT THE VERY THIN INSOLE AND USE A BETTER ONE. SUCH A WASTE
4,Great shoes. Just wish they lasted longer.,"These shoes look great, are comfortable, and affordable.The only downside is that, for me, they don't hold up all that long. I've gone through 2 pair in less than 2 years. They start to come apart inside after awhile. I put allot of time in on my feet though. 60 hours a week or so. I guess for some reason I expect shoes to last longer.But they are a good value. I'll keep buying them as I wear out old ones."
1,What a horrible phone,"I have had this phone for a year now and it sucks. the touch screen no longer works, it calls ramdom #'s and then hangs up al the time. No one can hear me and if they can it sounds like i'm in a well. I would not ever own this phone again. I gave it to my 8 month old to play with at least its getting used now."
1,Terrible Phone,"Yes, it looks cool, but other than that it's a terrible phone. The touchpad is difficult to use, the numbers are pretty small, the battery dies rapidly. In a word, awful. Even disregarding the fact that the sales woman assured me the phone could play itunes (which it can't and I should have known that) it's still a crappy phone. It makes calls on its own. I'm not sure about hitting the side key twice in rapid sucession, after just testing it, all I have to do is hit the key once and it's able to dial on its own. Additionall, the phone does not recognize when keystrokes are being used as part of the connection. Meaning, when I try to check my voicemail, the phone acts like I'm doing other things when I type in my password. That's an issue I've never had with another phone. It's really difficult to use call waiting. Find another phone to buy. I should have gotten a razor."
1,horrible,My friend had this phone and I had the hardest time entering my number in. I put my name in and went down to where you put the number in and started putting it in. Somehow it got back on my name and started entering things. Also the number didn't even enter right when that was fixed
1,Junk,"If you are using this product more than once a week don't buy it, the unit will break down!!!!!"
4,Les Brown Revisited,"I bought this CD on a nostalgic whim. Having been raised on Swing, I felt this music would sit well with me and my friends. Close your eyes to these pieces, and you can feel the soul of the ""Greatest Generation"": something that seems to be missing in today's music, no matter how well constructed. My favorite track is ""Moonglow"". It captures the gossamer essence of what dreams are made. This is an above average CD that will leave your friends tapping their toes, and will cause your children to hold their ears. This is the music of class, exhileration, and BAM!"
2,Pretty rough...,"I bought these as a replacement for my Grado Sr60s. These are pretty rough. Im sure that over time they will get better, but at the moment these are pretty hideous. I've tried washing them with hand soap, dish detergent, and fabric softener...but that did not make much difference. A little bit disappointed. Im not sure if these are genuine Grado replacements or a third party product, but they are very uncomfortable."
5,Nearly perfect for SR60 - your fit may vary,"I've had my SR60's for at least 10 years now, I'm on my 3rd seat of cushions. This is the first time I've tried out the L-Cush version. For my fit, these are much nicer than the originals.As most people say, the Grado SR60's are great sounding headphones, but the fit leaves something to be desired. I had to do some slight mods (bending) to mine so I didn't feel like my head was in a clamp. But I always liked the original cushions. Then I found a headphone forum with some customization options people have tried, like cutting out the centers, peeling off the screen, etc. I tried cutting out the centers on some old pads that I was going to replace anyway, and I couldn't get it to work right, so this time I decided to try the L-Cush.For me they fit great, even better than the originals, the cushions feel like they balance the pressure a bit more.In my opinion, if you have your SR60 fit dialed in now, and need new cushions, these really do feel like an upgrade."
4,Just as you'd expect,"My old ones dried up and started to crumble part, so I got these to replace them. $20 is kind of steep for just pads. I have not tried any other styles of pads, so I can't make any direct comparison, but I have no problem wearing these."
2,I hope these are more comfortable on higher end models.,"I snatched these cushions up hoping for a wonderful boost in ergonomics that the majority of other reviewers have experienced, however the original SR60 Grado cushions were far more soft and homey for my ears.As others have recommended, I had some positive results bending the headphone band backward to reduce pressure on my ears. This technique takes some experimentation before getting a perfect balance between the pressure of the headphones on your ears and center of your head, but was certainly more of an improvement than this $20 upgrade. I hope I have better luck with these cushions when I invest in a higher end model. Happy hunting!-Chase"
2,Not what you think they are...,"If you're planning on putting these on your SR-60/80i for a boost in performance, you're going to be sorely (pun intended) disappointed. I bought these to use with the SR-60i... bad idea.Right now, I have the set of SR-225i that I upgraded to sitting in front of me (which include the genuine Grado L-Cush pads), and also a set of these L-Cush pads side by side. The cushions that were included with the 225i are made of much softer foam than these, which have an inner ring of harder foam that touches your ears and is quite inflexible, creating a pinching sensation within a half an hour of use.I'd take the comfy pads included with the SR60/80i over these any day for comfort alone; or, buy the SR-125i that includes the real cushions -- which are indeed quite nice and provide great soundstage and audio quality."
2,uncomfortable,"I don't like these at all. While they do create a nice sound signature with some Grados, I can't wear them for very long before they really start bothering my ears. They aren't supra-aural, and they aren't circum-aural either. The sort of fit on the outsides, over the tops of the edges of your ears. So ear size and shape is extremely important in terms of whether these will work for you or not. I much prefer the comfies (S-cushions) for both comfort, and sound signature for most Grados. (I.e., I believe that most Grados are too bright, and the comfies are just the thing to tame the pushed mids/highs.)"
5,Why Did I Wait?,I just purchased these for my SR60s. I don't know why I waited so long! The L-Cush is a huge improvement over the original pads. I used Sennheiser replacement pads for a long time but they were ugly (yellow!) and rather uncomfortable.The only problem I've encountered is they make my ears hot. The crumbling over time issue is not only a problem with this particular pad--all foam pads like this will crumble over time. They are cheap enough to replace when they start to crumble.I haven't used my Grados for a long time because my pads had worn out and it was quite uncomfortable. Purchasing these replacement pads has given new life to my cans!
3,Nice that these are available,"The original ear cushions on this headphone started to deteriorate after about 3 years. the foam started crumbling and leaving foam bits on your ears and face. I was glad to see they had replacements, but thot the price was a tad high. The shipping cost was ridiculous for 2 small foam pieces (thus 3 stars). They fit perfectly on the headphones and it's nice not to have foam pieces shedding all over the place once again. For the price and quality of the earphones, Grado needs to use a higher grade material for their ear cushions."
5,"Gives your cans that ""new set"" feeling again","My first pair of SR-80's that I've been wearing daily were starting to get a little worn after 6 years of service. These may have a high price, but it's nice to be able to get replacements, and nice to have choice as well, since the newer SR-80i's come with the same cushions as the old SR-60, which cover the voice coil and can affect the sound. Plus, knowing that Grado still makes their stuff here in the US makes the premium a little easier to take."
4,Better than stock pads,"When I put these pads on my SR-60's I noticed that my ears did not get as hot as they did with the stock pads. As far as comfort goes, these pads are not super comfortable, neither are they uncomfortable. Strange I know, the rim of the pads that cover your ears is a bit rough, almost textured. To soften the pads I washed them in warm water and shampoo, it definitely helped. These also let more sound through than the stock pads. I recommend replacing the stock pads with these pads.Pro's:-Brighter sound-Better fit-More comfortable(when broken in)Con's:-Bit spendy-Needs washing"
1,These hurt more than the original.,First off let me say I think the original pads that come with Sr60's feel fine. A little sore after 4 or 5 hours of use. The L-CUSH just don't feel right. I actually miss the padding over the entire speaker. Now my ears feel like they are molded into a tube if that makes sense. My ears are bending and it does not feel right. I do like how they are thicker but for the most part I wont be using these.I don't have a big head or ears either...at least I hope not!Was hoping for something a lot better.
2,Sound from a shoebox.,"Buaaahhhh!!!It's a bad way to present a great band like Steely Dan. The music it's OK. Every song of Walter 'n Donald are splendorous, but this 2 Cd's, sounds like a Long Play used; The name of the collection must be: ""fried eggs sounds around the melodies"".Please, don't buy this CD. Waste your money buying the remastered originals."
4,If you're tired of American and Brit punk...,"This album is for you! This album makes me want to jump up and down, there's so much energy here...these guys are great, I never thought punk rock could be so refreshing. Japan has breathed new life into the genre. The guitar riffs on this record are great, kind of a throwback to surf-rock, lots of fun. I don't know what the heck they're saying most of the time, but that's probably a good thing considering the song titles- don't think I want to know...enjoy!"
4,Much better than the green text book,"A valuable study guide indeed. I passed the NAB exam a few weeks ago....and this book was a huge help.......a wise investment. Also, for what it's worth.......I had a'lot of experience in LTC (Assistant Activity Director, etc.)....I was also a State Nursing Home surveyor for 4.5 years before starting my AIT........listen up: the NAB is the hardest exam I've ever taken in my entire life! It's the kind of test that'll bring you to tears......trust me on this......study like you've never studied before in your life!!"
2,Good but not great.,Def. better than nothing but be sure to study everything and not just this book and the green administrators licensure book.
1,Worthless,I memorized every single question in this book and still did not pass the NAB test the first time around. DO NOT waste your money!!
1,An apalling effort to justify her murder of her own child.,"I was sickened by this book. This woman is proud of the thousands of lifes she has taken. She evens describes feeling the convulsions of her own baby in utero as she had it injected with concentrated saline. She chose to do this at 20 weeks, at a time when the baby has already been felt kicking and moving for many weeks. As the mother of six beloved children, I simply cannot imagine how another mother could choose her own convenience over the life of her child. How does one negate the value of life based on age? And how is this thought process different than that of Hitler who negated the value of life based on race?The ""right to choose"" is one that should be treasured by all, yet why do we use this term for the right to kill? Why not choose not to conceive? Or if an unwanted pregnancy does occur, why not choose to place the baby with one the thousands of couples waiting and waiting to adopt?"
5,Danny Kaye is Wonder Man,"For all of us Danny Kaye fans it's hard to get enough of this talented guy. So in this movie he does a dual role--Twins. Even with early split-screen technology the production is first rate, and the Danny Kaye is even better."
5,Kaye's greatest,"I saw this movie 7 times when it first came out. I thought then, and I still do, that Danny Kaye was never as funny as he was in this film."
1,have not seen it yet,i am still waiting for the dvd to arrive its been 3 weeks and still no parcel please find out on where it isthanks
2,love the movie but...,"this is a low quality encoding, there is no FBI warning like you would see on a store bought movie. early in the movie during a dance number there is so much blocking that it is hard to see the picture. if i had to guess, i would call it an in home low budget copy. love the movie, don't like the quality."
1,THE VERSION ABOVE IS A BOOTLEG !!!!,"This ""DIGITALLY MASTERED"" version of Wonderman is an Asian bootleg that has circulated for years. The original offical version has Samuel Goldwyn collection at the top of the cover and is in a snapper case. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY SUPPORTING PIRACY !! PICTURE QUALITY AND SOUND ARE AWFUL !!!"
4,slimjaz,good but not what i was trying too find .i was trying to find eightball #ewcd101 if you can help me i would really be greatful thank you
2,Poor quality,"I purchased the product, ACCEL Points Eliminator kit 2020 and upon installation, The Roto Shutter (Part #338 thin plastic) completely fell apart in my hands while getting it out of the package. Had to order the replacement part from Summit Racing at an additional cost for the replacment part (MAA-338) and additional cost for expedited delivery to put the car on the road again. I actually was thankful it fell apart before installation rather than while on the freeway."
3,Toshiba Numeric Keypad for MAC,Amazon lists the product as MAC-compatible but there are no instructions for its use with a MAC with the product. In fact it only works with MAc if you depress NumLock on the keypad during computer startup. This has to be repeated if the computer is turned off but not when it is just put to sleep. Since I rarely turn off my MAC completely this is not a real problem. I do think Amazon or Toshiba should explain this anomaly. I'm sure that many MAC users would return it in disgust if they did not seek help from google on how to use it. The keypad is useful because wireless MAC keyboards come without a numeric keypad.
2,Not for everyday use,"This is okay if it will be in use once in a while. If you are looking for something to use a lot (maybe work from home and you are used to using a 10 key), you may not like this. The placement/sizing of the keys doesn't seem quite right and they feel a little stiff to push. So the result is not a smooth and fast typing of numbers like you may be used to on a regular keyboard. I ended up not using this at all."
5,Very handy tool.,"I have recently been studying accounting, this keypad works so smoothly and I can place it where it's comfortable ergonomically. The extra ports are a plus. Highly recomended, a great bargain for the price along with Toshiba quality."
5,Great 10-Key,"Perfect 10 Key, very affordable and works great. I would rather have a double 0 then the triple 0 button. Other than that the product is great, perfect match for my Toshiba Laptop."
3,Apples needs to design one of these...,"The keypad works okay. I have to hold down the number lock for 4 seconds on starting up the computer. Don't know if it's a compatibility issue with Snow Leopard or not. However. the lack of EQUALS key is wreaking havoc for me, as I'm using the keypad for note entry in Finale. If only Apple would design one of these, it would be amazing. How people use this PC-based stuff is beyond me. Even the hardware kind of blows...."
4,Does everything it claims - include run on Mac OSX 10.5,"I bought this after reading several reviews for other numeric pads that were supposedly compatible with Apple OSX, but failed to work with Leopard. I plugged it in and it just worked. (Toshiba's website claims compatibility with Mac OS 8.6 and above).This is a rather simple numeric pad, it doesn't have programmable keys nor does it have a calculator screen. However, it works quite well. It is sturdy built, the keys are comfortable to use, the usb hub is conveniently located out of the way as not to interfere with typing, ect. It is also thinner than I expected which is a benefit since I bought it for travel."
3,Good number pad,I'm on the road a lot for work and hate entering data into spreadsheets using the number row on the laptop keyboard. I got this to enter data more easily and to get the extra usb ports. The number pad part works great but the usb ports cant support my external portable laptop harddrive which kinda defeats the purpose of having a usb hub.
1,Toshiba numeric Keypad,I have only had the keypad mseveral months and it quiamazon over the years.t working and there is no where on Toshiba's website to find help. In the garbage it went.This is not the type of quality I've grown know from
3,Good product but don't use it,"I bought this when I bought a laptop. I do financial spreadsheets quite often and I hated to give up a keypad. It was easy to set up and works fine with the laptop. The zero key is small and a little a little hard to use. I like the USB slot it has and I hooked my wireless mouse into it. Worked with no problems.After a week or two I unhooked it and haven't hooked it back up. No problems, just think its as easy to use computers keys as this keypad"
1,Wrong item shipped,"I ordered the Keypad from Toshiba Direct, they sent me the wrong item, they shipped me the full sized keyboard, and refused to exchange it unless I paid for postage. Customer service rep said they do not and have never made a mistake. Therefore I will rate the keyboard for the keypad I ordered, it is way to big to fit in my laptop case."
5,Toshiba PA1390U-1NKP Slim USB Numeric Keypad with 2-Port USB Hub,This is just what I needed and works great! Much faster when entering customer orders!
4,An Amazing Movie,"The premise seems far too improbable, but the result is very believable. In post-communist Russia, everyone wants to be someone, but nobody quite knows who that someone is. In this surreal world, three people's lives become entwined in ways both painful and funny. The trio make a bizarre peace with one another until the usual set of angry parents set that world on its ears. The ending slips into fantasy, but it is a charming fantasy.The movie is a romp, a bedroom comedy that involves the kitchen, the living room, the shower. It's a fantasy of self-discovery that supplants the surreal journey of consumerism with the attempt of each character to make sense of all that confuses and realize it is you I love."
4,"Unique, bold","The movie is very unique- based around a love triangle in Russia. Actually well acted, good story, glad I saw it. If the lead character had been a little more attractive, I would have given it 5 stars. He's borderline, and the two people in love with him are gorgeous, which stretches credibility. Be sure & watch the deleted scenes, best part of the movie. They were taken out because of nudity."
5,"GO EAST, YOUNG MEN!!!!!!!!!!!","I saw this film in South Beach the very day it opened, knowing in my heart that it was going to be an extremely sensitive, original and exquisite film (rather, work of art. Having grown up among Russians, Ukrainians, Czechs and Slovaks in Chicago, and having experienced the delights of Eastern Europe post-Berlin Wall,this movie reconfirmed for me what I have always known about Russian men in particular: they are just like us!!! Bi-curious, gay and confused!!! Want more? Check out ""THE CREATION OF ADAM""!!! Can I give this a couple of extra stars???!!!??"
5,Love it!!,"I absolutely love Leslie Sansone, but a lot of her DVDs can seem somewhat of a repeat of the previous one. This one is different and I am enjoying the strength training I am getting from it. It offers interval trainings of brisk walking and strengthening exercises to the gluts, thighs, triceps, biceps and more with the stretchie band. I love the intervals and find this a very satisfying and fun DVD!!"
5,Nice and different from Leslie,"Yes, you still walk and do the basic four steps, but you have intervals of strength training with the stretchie band. Hand weights work just as well if you don't have a band. Let me tell you, your muscles will be humming when you're done with this one! My kind of strength training! Thanks, Leslie!"
2,Disappointed,"It certainly wasn't what I was expecting. I thought I was going to get a GOOD WALKING video but in turn got more strength training with this stretchy band thing that I don't even have. I didn't like how it began with walking only to stop walking and start toning. I would have liked it better if it were strictly a walking video with walking all the time with added toning, not stopping walking while toning. I don't much care for this one and I LOVE the other tapes I own but this one, I was disappointed."
1,Disappointing,"As someone who exercises to Leslie Sansone videos everyday, I found this new video, that includes a two mile walk, very disappointing. You are supposed to workout with this new stretchie band she wants you to buy that doesn't even come with the purchase of the video. I just want to walk, not deal with contraptions or extra things to purchase or do. If you don't mind the ridiculousness of the stretchie band or the additional price, then you will like this video, otherwise stick to the other express videos. The 4 mile one is my favorite; it is powerful, simple, easy and something you can do everyday and will keep you trim, flexible and with a nice healthy glow on your face. :)"
2,They didn't include the stretchy thing,You can not do this dvd without the exercise band and no where on the description did it say that would be not included. I had to buy it separatley after giving the dvd as a gift
5,PARA LOS CHAVOS,"Otras, son muy super y sirven un titipuchal, sobre todo en casa de los rucos de nuestra girlfriend...Hubo muchas partes que me gustaron y pude usar...Otras, no me gustan."
5,Worthy of any Buster Keaton Collection,"While there's no Cops, The Goat or Neighbors in this ""shorts"" collection, I found Buster to be his usual comical self. Notable shorts are The Gold Ghost, Allez Oop, One Run Elmer, Grand Slam Opera (Buster's moves are great!!) and Jail Bait. Loads of smiles and laughs!! Worthy of any Buster Keaton collection."
4,"Have you seen ""Grand Slam Opera?""","I bought this because I'm a big Buster fan. Although some of the shorts included in here aren't the best of Buster's work, it definitely is worth taking a look at. I LOVE ""Grand Slam Opera,"" ""The Chemist,"" ""Hayseed Romance,"" and ""Tars and Stripes"" among others. And even though many of these shorts are not as sophisticated as the silent ones, they still contain little gems of material that make you laugh."
2,It really assume that you are a real dummy,"If you want to spend some good time laughing that's the right book for you, but if you really want to learn C you should read another book . The author of this book spent too much time to explain too simple things (actually it takes 1 or 2 chapters just to explain how to print something on the screen). But if you are a real dummy you may enjoy it"
2,Very Non-Standard,"The amount of non-standard code and poor programming practices inside this book are astounding. Let me iterate that main() must return int. dos.h is not a standard header file. It must be understood that C is a portable language, with certain ""built in"" functions and header files. As a beginner book, I believe that you should understand the actual language, before moving into different extensions of it. Many people do not use DOS/Windows for development. I use Linux for instance. On an upside, the writer does have a sense of humour, which is the only thing that prevented me from throwing this book into the trash."
3,A+ for beginners D+ for anyone with any experience,"If you have no previous experience programming whatsoever, then this is the C book for you.As an illustration, my programming experience was in Atari and Apple Basic (anyone remember the Atari 400 or the Apple IIe?), and never proceeded past 1984. Clearly I have minimal experience to say the least.While this book did contain some useful information for me, but nothing that I could not get from and number of on-line tutorals...."
3,Good for Getting Your Getting Your Feet Wet,I found this book quite slow but it is quite good for the begining programer who knows nothing about programing. It's also a little funny.
5,"If you're learning C, this book is the way to go.",I'ts a great buy. I can't stop going through it because it's so interesting. It's not boring at all. The author takes so much care to present everything in a fun manner. And he includes so many aspects. You're not missing anything with this book.
1,Non standard C code,"I would not recommend this book for anyone. It follows non ansi standard code. This was my initial book in attempting to learn C. I should have know better by the title, he should have studied the ansi standard before trying to teach unsuspecting users. 1 star is being generous. If you check newgroups, comp.lang.c will show you more reasons against this ghastly book. Examples? void main() this is dangerous and can cause problems.If you dont run a Microsoft computer, with either the MS compiler, borland or other MS compiler, you will have alot of trouble compilign the example code as it sits. better to Go Get `C Programming Language' by Kernigahn and Ritchie."
5,Outstanding performance--a must have!,"Listening to this CD, you would never know it was remastered! Sound quality is true acoustically, and sounds like a fine modern studio recording in stereo. These performances are from the mid-1940's, and stand as great Mozart interpretations--passionate but not Romanticized. And the four great artists of the Griller Quartet with the great William Primrose as the added violist offer the highest level of string playing you'll ever hear, individually and as an ensemble."
5,More Classic Humour,"'Mon Oncle' is Jacque Tati's third film and continues the adventures of the accident-prone hero, M. Hulot. It again observes peoples' peccadilloes, but also satirizes the foibles of the modern mechanical world. Again, the humour is quiet and subdued, and the film is a fitting sequel to 'M. Hulot's Holiday'."
5,in a class by itself,"Mon Oncle pokes fun at modern contrivances by contrasting the muddled world of Monsieur Hulot and the modern world of his sister and her husband, who runs a manufacturing business that's ahead of its time. The humor reminds you at times of Charlie Chaplin with a little Three Stooges mixed in. Sensual in detail, the scenes move back and forth from Hulot's old-world neighborhood to his sister's futuristic home, where even opening a kitchen cabinet requires knowing the right button to push. And Hulot never does. This movie in one of my top ten, and it's my favorite movie of Jacques Tati."
3,Minimalist humor,"I loved these when I was small & my grandfather & I walked to the local theater on saturdays afternoons. BUT...as an adult with so many movies watched it is not something I'd actually sit through. It is fine in the back ground while doing other things but after the first time TATi is simply very slow. It all has a timeless truthfull humor but is a bit like waiting for the kettle to boil. Recommended to anyone to check out by renting, because it has a special mood. I think about 15 minutes of it is more than sufficient. The pacing is similar to so Hiyao Miyazaki."
1,This film is NOT FUNNY at all!!,"This film is, without any doubt, THE WORST FILM I EVER SAW. I watched it waiting for anything remotely funny but all I saw was VERY BORING indeed."
4,Tati vs. Gadgetry,"Jacques Tati wrote, directed, and starred in this satire of modern gadgetry. He visits his sister's house, which occupies a definite spot in one of the circles of Dante's Hell: the furniture is ugly and useless, the kitchen sounds like the insides of an auto repair shop, all the ""modern"" conveniences are eyesores and demonic. The movie consists of mostly all sight gags, some funny, others not. Tati is the French Chaplin: there's very little dialogue, he wears a set costume (raincoat and pipe), there are lots of weird background noises and pratfalls. There's a lot of subtlety here, too, (it's not the THREE STOOGES by a longshot), and a lot of care went into the little things - all of them visual, of course (Tati doesn't speak at all). But it can fall flat at times, and it does go on too long. It's a very clever idea, though."
1,This book is an absolute slap in the face.,"I'm in the eighth grade and I was forced to read this book. i flat out hated it. I have a lot of patience, but who has the time to sit and read a book that goes on and on about nothing? How can those women be so cold-hearted? That's probably why Miss havisham got burned in the first place. I bet her heart was cooled off after that. Frankly, this was one of the first books I had ever read by Charles Dickens, i must say that this will be the last. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is as bad as it gets.Instead of taking a sleeping pill,just read this book!"
1,chromium picolinate,"bought this book at a used-book store on a whim, read the whole thing that night, went out and bought chromium picolinate and am taking it.it is good book for a diabetic to read also (I am one).It is sensible and thorough, definitely worth reading and buying the stuff."
1,Terrible,"This picture has been blown up so much, it is grainy and sandy looking. It's a terrible product that I ended up throwing away. When I complained to the seller, I was told that it was meant to look that way; very retro. What a load!"
4,"Nice product, does the job","Needed a bigger windshield. This is good and tall, and wide enough. Not as wide as I'd hoped, but you can't have it all. Easy enough to install. Looks good. Can adjust the angle of the windshield so that's a plus. Excellent vendor, quick and responsive. Highly recommend the vendor."
1,Don't buy this!!!,If you think your computer messed-up now wait and see what this does to it! You better have what you need to reformat and reload your harddrive ready because you will need it after this!
3,Not As Described,"I've yet to try these ink cartridges out in my printer, so I can't review them, quality-wise; but I ordered this product based on the product description ('S020189' and 'Twin Pack' in the product title, and below that, in the product description itself: 'Package includes 2 black cartridges.') Also, when I ordered the product, the product image was missing, so I could not see a picture of the product. But based on the product description, I ordered what seemed to clearly be a package of two BLACK S020189 ink cartridges, and instead received ONE S020189 black cartridge, and ONE S020191 color ink cartridge. Not exactly truth in advertising. Also, elsewhere in the product description, a 'magenta cartridge' is referred to, which doesn't apply AT ALL to this product."
4,"It's a decent textbook, but a bit too expensive if bought new","The readings are not too challenging and the left hand page has all of the definitions for words that intermediate learners of German may not yet know, making it helpful in learning new German. The written exercises can be a bit tedious at times in my opinion, but they're not too bad. Definitely buy used though, as the new price is way too much for being as old as it is and as short as it is."
4,Der Weg zum Lesen,"I am an intermediate student of German and this book was a required text for one of my classes.It is spot on for my language level and I'd recommend it to others. It is essentially a collections of short stories,some about a page long, to some about 3 pages long. The German text is only on odd numbered pages, while the evennumbered pages are filled with translations of special phrases, and vocabulary, which may not be known to anintermediate learner. The layout of the book makes the reading very convenient.If you are a self-learner, this book may be a little frustrating to you. It was great for me because evenwith the left hand translation page, I still had questions, but was able to ask my teacher in class. The stories are not modern, and so need a little explaining to the modern reader to help put it in context."
4,T. E. T. A.,"What a beautiful film. Filmed so crystal clear that is is reminiscent of the cinematography of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. At the end of a film like this, your heart aches and you find that you cannot easily shake the memory of it away. Li Xue Jian is magnificent. With his charisma, he is the personification of the intrinsic man. While he is a king, we see that he is also human. A man fraught with fear, with love, with hatred, with loneliness, and while intoxicated with power, he understands that he is powerless. A wonderful performance, which shows the complexities of character and the multi-faceted id.As for Gong Li,who plays the Lady Zhou, what can you say? Just that her smile alone makes my heart ache as I realize I can never again be content with a woman any less than she."
4,Good,"Very cool movie from a Chinese perspective. The costumes and set puts any history lover right into the thick of ancient China. The story moves along nicely with plenty of drama and action. Although this film is an enjoyable piece of Chinese propaganda (similar to Hero where the ruthlessness of China's 1st emperor is explained as serving the greater good), the story within (about the same ruthless Ying Zheng) is told with a certain sense of integrity that allows the viewer to observe and form their own conclusions in the end.Based on action and drama, I would highly recommend this movie in general, but if you enjoy historical themed movies this is a must. Consider it a Chinese alternative to Braveheart--philosophically different and factually suspect but still finds a way to put you there then."
5,The Emperor & the Assassin,"An excelle.nt though graphic depiction of early courtly life during the Qin Dynasty. Beautiful cinematography and accurate historical setting. All in all, a pleasure to watch."
4,Startled into watching the whole three hours!,"I was channel surfing and I happened across this film. It's a 3-hour film but I was riveted to the screen. The plot is pretty good, but the costuming and historical accuracy is amazing! The political strategies are to the point, and the love stories poignant, if not ever happy. There is a LOT of war and death, so if violence bothers you, don't watch this. Also, there is a lot of violence against children, and people just giving up the ghost for honor/duty/a cause.I was so struck that I immediately purchased the DVD so I could watch it at my leisure."
3,History of China's First Emperor.,"Too bad this film is not in league with ""The Last Emperor"". Nice cinematography, plot and character development marred by poor editing that jumps from scene to scene making the story difficult to follow. Almost as if the film was tightened from a Chinese mini-series."
1,Totally awful,"Other than the cinematography, it is total ... Historical inaccuracies, zero entertainment value, pretentious. I'm Chinese and I hate the movie. In fact I do not know of any Chinese who likes it. For those who named this an epic, PUURLEEEESE... go and watch ""The Three Kingdoms"" Even the recently made ""Yongzheng Dynasty"" qualifies more as an epic than this film that serves only to pander to the needs & tastes of the Western audience."
2,Confusing for Westerners,"The ups and downs of a fuedal Chinese king, it isn't King Lear, and it's sort of predictable with a dash of Kung Fu, Grasshopper. There's plenty of extras in 2nd Century battle gear though not much battle as in Kubicks's Spartacus. The motives of the main characters are assumed for Eastern audiences, but Westerners may be scratching their heads."
2,Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood...,"I bought this movie because I really liked Shanghai Triad (which also starred Gong Li). Unfortunately, I was disappointed - Emperor and Assassin is really more like a Shakespearean play than a movie.By that I mean that the plot, staging, and dialogue are all very contrived. It's more like watching a very long play than a movie. You see the characters, and you can understand what's going on and why they're doing what they're doing, but the kind of emotional involvement with the characters that you get with a movie never happened for me. The characters all just seemed very one-dimensional..."
1,Awful,"Beautiful cinematography, but that's it. The movie is way too slow, and Gong Li is getting worse with each movie. She is not even among the most talented Chinese actresses since the 80s."
1,The Emperor and The Assassin,"Save your money. Subtitles ruined what would otherwise be a ""half"" decent movie. With today's technology you would think they would have released an English version of this movie for North America."
5,Wonderful DVD for children.,"I have movie nights with my twin grandchildren. I am always trying to find movies that will entertain them and teach them. WordWorld is the best series ever!!! The stories keep their attention, make them laugh, yet teach them words and letters of the alphabet!! I intend to purchase every WordWorld DVD and give them to all my grandchildren."
5,The Masterpiece for the Master Magician,This great CD is anything but an illusion! This is an excellent arraingment of songs that David did some of his most incredible illusions to. David Copperfield is the greatest magician of our time and this CD compilation is a reflection of his greatness on stage! Listen and Live The Dream!!
4,"Alright, but not all that great","Although some songs were OK, the cd wasn't all that I expected. Not many songs by groups that I know of, but the emotion of the cd gave it 4 stars."
5,Great Jewish folk music.,The Karmon Israeli Singers were hugely popular in the 50's. They were even on the Ed Sullivan show I believe. They performed everywhere. Their music is wonderfully upbeat or sadly solemn on the same album. I have always enjoyed the minor keys and chords popular in this style of folk music.
1,santa ynez valley wine country,"I was extremely disappointed with this, I am so sorry I wasted twenty bucks. This is just a poorly done home video, with little information. Don't waste your money."
3,Why do so many hate this film?,"After hearing that this film made the #1 on the bottom 100 for IMDB last fall, I decided to give it a go.I just finished watching this film and I can see no reason other than the ""Bennifer in splitsville"" for this film to get such low ratings. If J lo and Ben Affleck were not in this film it would surely get better reviews. (in my opinion) There is poor acting but the plot is very original and interesting.It certainly is not one of the best films I have seen but I will give it a C+"
3,Gigli a mixed bag of nonsense & enjoyable fluff,"ok, i was one of only 17 people who saw the movie opening weekend, as a jennifer fan. I heard the bad reviews, and felt they were revenge for the publicity around Bennifer's relationship from the mass media. While I understood some of the points made, after seeing it, i didn't entirely agree. It isn't the best movie ever made, but it is nowhere near being the worst either. I think of it as fluff, but still enjoyable. Don't watch it expecting to think, kind of like Baywatch. It has some of that lesbian love nonsense in it from Affleck's Chasing Amy, but that aside, the film has an unfair rep. so, give it a shot, then judge. It's only fluff, and what's wrong with that? cotton candy is made of fluff, and you don't hear the news giving bad reviews about it, do you? i dunno. you judge, or move onto the next review. have a nice day! peace!"
1,HA HA HA HA HA HA,"Im going to tell you this. THIS MOVIE IS GARBAGE. But so are most of jennifer lopez,s movies."
4,Way worse movies,The dialoge if funny and so is the movie. This movie isn't as bad as everyone says. Watch Master of disquise you won't think that this is the worst movie. Fair game was much worse. Waterworld was much worse. It was a good movie that is really under rated
3,Not THAT bad,"Well, sometimes I like to watch movies that most people hate to know what is so bad about them... You know what? I actually think that it's VERY underrated! Sure, it's not very good and I guess that the acting is bad (who cares?), but it's nowhere near as bad as it's made out to be! It has some fairly funny bits. I really don't understand why it's so hated (because the hate some people have for it is pretty damn extreme)... It's just another silly romantic comedy. It isn't worse than all of the others.Oh well, my guess is that they hate it only because it's the ""cool"" thing to do. Hell, I bet that some of them liked it, but they're too afraid to say what they really think."
2,There are movies LESS watchable.,"Gigli is not as horrible as people claim it is. Sure it's bad, but I've seen plenty worse.1. Joe Dirt2. National Lampoon's European Vacation3. Nightmare on Elm Street 2-124. Freeway 25. Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen6. House of a 1000 Corpses7. Bones8. Tank Girl9. Ticker10. Belly11. Daredevil12. Not Another Teenage Movie13. Friday the 13th 2-1514. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure15. Dead Alive16. Ed and His Dead Mother17. Sprung18. Ringmaster19. Bully20. Titanic"
2,I'm sorry Ben,"I've never been much of a Jennifer Lopez fan but I'm a huge fan of Ben's. I usually go and see his movies opening weekend but even before Gigli came out I could tell from the trailers it was a stinker. I finally saw it this weekend after it's been out forever and I'm sad to say, this is a bad movie. I still love you, Ben. This is just didn't cut it."
5,pretty cool! tjmill91,i rented it from blockcuster it was a hip and sexy movie. a little humor and alot of [...]this is a cool movie.
1,Yes!,"Oh sweet Lord! My sister and I bought this as a joke gift for our mom's birthday. Thank God I didn't waste my money seeing it in theaters. It was so bad, I was amazed! The dialogue was so bad it made me cry I laughed so hard. My favorite scene is when Ben Affleck is looking in the mirror talking about how he is a bull and how J.Lo (who does an audacious job playing a lesbian hitman - or is it hitwoman?) is a cow. ""Bull- grrr- Cow!"" It was amazing. Also it says the f-word on average between 1 and 1 and a half times a minute. Oh yes, this, along with Fear Dot Com, is one of the worst movies ever created. But I WOULD recommend downloading it or something just for laughs. God, it was aweful.P.S. ""Animals big and small search for the vagina"" - J.Lo"
1,Thank god your reading this,As I attempted to take my own life with a coat hanger after the first 30 minutes of this film!!!
1,What????,"Who is the moron that sat in front of his computer and put in all those 5 star reviews? Ben? Good Lord, buddy, find something else to do!!"
1,What were they thinking?,"Like Madonna, J-Lo continues to humiliate herself instead of swallowing her pride and acknowledging her acting inability. Ben Affleck can be great as evidenced by his stunning performance in ""Changing Lanes,"" but he phoned it in here. This embarassment should be swept under the rug and avoided at all costs."
3,"""Gigli"" rhymes with really, as in really, really odd","If you're expecting a normal, by-the-books romantic comedy, do not purchase Martin Brest's (""Midnight Express"") ""Gigli,"" the critically-devoured crime romance starring love-birds Ben Affleck (""Daredevil"") and Jennifer Lopez (""Out Of Sight""). This film, in terms of the genre, is as quirky as they come as every scene of love is followed by either: a.) a steamy sex sequence, b.) tons of violence, including slit wrists and brain-matter in a fish thank, or c.) a string of curse words more colorful than the film's flashy cinematography. But, of course, quirkiness doesn't always equal greatness, as ""Gigli,"" while entertaining for a Saturday afternoon, is as mediocre as they come, despite a few sequences of solid acting and witty sexual monolouges."
2,How Come?,"Most of the people who give This movie Five stars, go on to say that People who do not find the movie great, don't understand it. Please explain exactly ""what was so great about it??"" I myself hoped to see a great movie with Ben and Jennifer, it was only mediocre at best. I am sure their careers will continue in better projects."
3,Worth watching if you don't intend to take it seriously.,"Imagine the Farrelly Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Ed Wood decided to combine forces and make a film and none of them had creative control. You'd end up with something like this.J-Lo, Ben, Pacino & Walken---you'd expect a story, good acting, and well-written dialogue. What you get is big stars with a stale plot. Contract killers, kidnapping, sexual tension, Ben Affleck trying to convert a lesbian (think ""Chasing Amy""). The tipping point is that the dialogue and acting are so poor that it seems to work as a Hollywood inside joke. J-Lo's ""gobble gobble"" remark to Ben when she succumbs to his advances has become legend. The high-density profanity is like an homage to ""Pulp Fiction"". The mentally challenged kidnappee seems to tribute Cameron Diaz' facile brother in ""There's Something About Mary"" or a younger ""Rain Man"". This movie stands as proof that either big stars don't take themselves too seriously OR that they will do anything for money."
2,"Ho-humm, but Walken and Pacino? Amazing Cameos!!!!","Well not the greatest thing to have hit the screens in recent years. Ben Afleck was as mediocre as ever. Jennifer Lopez was competent I suppose. Justin Bartha was pretty good in the role of the challenged kidnap victim. BUT, YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR TWO OUTRAGEOUS CAMEO PERFORMANCES FROM CHRISTOPHER WALKEN AND AL PACINO. In fact I would go so far as to say, skip through the movie to these scenes, where the two veteran actors totally dominate the movie in what is probably less than 10 minutes of screen time. You will rarely see such quality performances. Walken with a subtle yet tension filled monologue tinged with madness, and Pacino with volcanic power that sends shivers up the spine. These two show more acting power in the arch of an eyebrow or narrowing of a pupil, than most pretty actors could ever aspire two. I was floored by Walken and Pacino. Oscar performances without a doubt. All others paled in comparison."
3,Monkeytot you need to research before you speak,"I just wanted to correct Mr. Monkeytot up there. Jersey Girl is not the sequal to Gigli. Jennifer Lopez isn't even the main female character, Liv Tyler is. Jen is only in the first 10 minutes of the movie!Anyway, about Gigli, I thought it was OK. Not as terrible as it was being made out to be, but not one of the best movies either. It's entertaining in some parts, and the guy who plays their captive does a good job."
1,What was J'lo and ben thinking?!?!,"How did these two get convinced to do this movie. Alot of people say Bad Boys 2 was the worst movie of 2003 but I beg to differ. This movie has a horrible plot, the characters are not believeable at all. I mean Ricki (j'lo) claims she's a lesbian and says she is a tough girl but her character doesn't prove any of these statements to be true. Gigli (Affleck) doesn't make us believe that he is a hard core gangster. Why do they take a mentally challenged kid hostage? Why were they asked to chop off his thumb? Did Gigli boss believe that he is so pathetic that he can't watch over this kid? Just look a another reviewer wrote, why were they hiding him if he was constantly riding in a convertable with the top down? The writers try to make us laugh in some scenes but the scenes that kind of make you smirk are the scences that were not intended to be funny. If you still want to see this movie, please rent it before you make a decision. You could end up saving $20 bucks."
1,Review for Gigli,"It's the stuff Mystery Science Theather 3000's are made of... a disaster of spectacular proportions. Put together enough pointess, random details, and you get Gigli, amovie that's less incompetent than bewildering. So forget the hype -- this movie would stink even without its big-ticket stars, which isn't to say that either is entirely blameless. The dialogue from writer-director Martin Brest is clunky, the film has serious tonal inconsistencies and at over two hours, it drags on way longer than it should. Really silly is the kindest way to describe this hopelessly misconceived exercise in celebrity self-worship... it has a special badness all its own. I highly recommend not seeing this junk."
1,Forget stars. This one needs a skull and crossbones,"Some movies are fun to watch BECAUSE they are bad, like ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" or ""Hell Comes to Frogtown."" This ain't one of 'em, folks. If I'd been chained to the couch and forced to watch it I'd gnaw my own foot off to get away from the tv. Love may be blind, but that is not sufficient reason for otherwise talented actors like Ben Affleck and JLo to make this waste of film. Ugh. Avoid at all costs. Watching this one will definitely turn the viewer into a vegetable."
5,A Modern Classic,"The moment you see Ben Affleck interrogating someone in a washing machine, you know you are in for a hell of a movie. Affleck, Lopez, and Pacino all perform the best they have in their careers."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,wish i could give a zero or negative star. please don't make Gigli 2. yes we're right...we don't like this movie!
1,"No, Its true!!!",I dreamed I saw a worse movie than this one and I woke up and some one had pooped on my head.
1,BAD!!!! OH SO BAD!!!,I'm sure by now you've heard how awful Gigli is. Guess what? It's worse. One of the most painful moviegoing experiences EVER. Gigli is a bomb. STAY AWAY!!!!!
1,NOT WORTH YOUR TIME,"I AM A HUGH BEN AFFLECK FAN FROM GLORY DAZE TO SUM OF ALL FEARS, I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL FAN. AFTER SEEING THIS MOVIE I HAVE TO CONSIDER ON IF HE IS WORTH ANY MORE OF MY HARD EARNEDV MONEY. THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE UNLESS ITS THE ONLY THING TO RENT."
1,A full litter box,"This movie is possibly the worst in the history of film making, what a great accomplishment. A full diaper of green dung."
1,No Chemistry,"What was Jennifer Lopez thinking of. It was absolutely bad enough that she is engaged to Ben Affleck, but unfortunately it seems just like a publicity stunt to see how much they are in love. Even the movie seemed as if it was a bigger joke, and it is a big joke. I really didn't like Gigli. There was absolutely no chemistry the couple had in the film.The film was really just awful, and I'm glad I didn't pay anything to see it. To be honest with you, I think it is just a shame that Jennifer Lopez oxerexposed herself too much within her movie career. She had better try for a better movie role next time. I think they should've given the role to Halle Berry and her husband, Eric Benet instead. Don't bother seeing this flick. You'll really regret spending the ten spot."
1,fake reviews,"Honestly guys if you're going to hire someone to put fake 5-star reviews, get someone with a little immagination.I've never seen so many one-line, vague, repetative reviews, PAGES of them!I hope the writer got a free Gigli DVD as payment (or punishment...)As for the movie, it's a classic, for all the wrong reasons."
2,Walken a glorious prick in a pincushion of mediocrity,This film was not so much bad or boring (the real sin of film) as embarrassing. I squirmed a lot. :) Worth the horror of it all watching Walken 'phone it in' and still be riveting and complicated. Bless that man.
1,"""to make up for this bad movie...","I shall put this carnivorous insect into my ear.AGGHHHHOH GOD NOOOOOOITS EATING OUT THE BACK OF MY SKULL""Such is the phrase that should have been uttered by the monsters who let this film come to life.I... I don't think I can explain it in words. So I shant.Run away... run..."
1,J-BLOWS,"Oh this movie painfully blows! I'm adding it to my worse movies ever collection along with GLITTER, SCARY MOVIE 3 and FAST and THE FURIOUS 1 & 2."
1,Giving this movie five stars is just.....,"...A representation of bad taste. I gave the movie a chance. Ben Affleck gave some really bad lines and acting, the plot was stupid, the title is horrible, Pachino just came in and did his standard ""Pachino"" role straight out of everything after Scarface(nothing that anyone should sweat over; we've all seen this Pachino before). Giving this movie five stars is about as smart as giving yourself five across the eyes for fun. Just a bad movie. At most, I can't see anyone giving it over three stars."
1,RAZZIE WINNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The people who rated this movie 5 stars should be the family of the ""producers"" or ""actors"" of this MEGA CRAP. IT IS A RAZZIE MASTERCRAP. MOVE ON MADONNA AND STALLONE, THE WORST ""ACTORS"" OF THE DECADE 2000-2010 AFFLECK AND LOPEZ!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Justin Bartha and Baywatch equal super gay,"Justin Bartha was supposed to be into girlsbut he sure was queer.""Brian"" was one of theworst characters ever.Justin Bartha was sogay.Just because he said the f-word 20+ timesdidn't make him any less gay!!!!"
1,Another Great Movie for Ms. Lopez,"I could do like some people and give this movie 5 stars, just out sarcastic humor, but I won't. This movie doesn't even deserve sarcasm. It was terrible. Of course I didn't see it, but it's a Jennifer Lopez movie, of course it's gonna be horrible.Honestly, the people who saw this movie should sue Jennifer Lopez and Ben Afflect for false advertisement. They lied and told the public this movie was great. In my opinion, that's worse than the whole Milly Vanilly lip-syncing incident."
1,fat head and phat butt in a movie together.,"Stop paying to see fat head's movies,maybe he will go away! Fat head is one of the most overated actors around but I have to hand it to him he gets all the best babes. That aside, every time I see one of Affleck's flicks I feel that he takes too much space on the screen, there is nothing subtle about him. You always feel that he is overdoing his scene and you hope that someone will punch him in that big square chin."
1,wrist slitting terrible,"this movie is horrible. Just plain bad. Bad plot, bad characters, bad on screen performers, bad camera angles, bad editing. This movie may cause blindness."
2,So bad it's hilarious!,"This was the most incredibly bad movie I've ever seen. It was absolutely hysterical! Okay, the heartwarming music that comes on just as Gigli puts the man into the laundry machine was so out of place I couldn't stand it. And J. Lo's character making Gigli read the phonebook to the boy for lack of a more suitable book when we see her, in the very next scene, reading a book?!! What a horrible movie! The scene with J. Lo doing yoga and discussing female genitalia was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life. Kudos to the writer, director, producers, and actors for making such a BAD cinematic work!"
1,E!'s 101 Biggest Celebrity Oops #1,I can see why this was the #1 Oops on E!'s 101 Biggest Celebrity Oops. Don't do a movie togethere. Seperate. Let's hope there's not a Gigli 2
1,gigli,"Note to future directors:In the future if you are going to direct a bad movie, please and I do mean please make it as short as possible. It is not fair to torture your fellow man longer than needed.Note to future viewers:Watch this only if you are a masochist and like to be tortured for long periods of time."
1,An the worst feature film goes to.......,I am very disappointed in Jennifer. This is NOT her best work! The movie seems to be terrible. I don't plan to watch this film again anytime soon. Her movie Maid in Manhattan was the best. I don't know what convince Jennifer to star in such a cheesy film! I recommend anyone not to see this terrible film. It's just downright bad. Everyone doesn't like this film either. And I don't blame them!
1,"GIGLI IS WORSE THAN ""MANOS,THE HANDS OF FATE""!!","I strongly recommend this movie becauseJennifer Lopez shows a lot of skin.As long as you can stomach the performanceof Justin Bartha as ""Brian"".It would not havebeen so bad if Affleck's character hadadministered a sound beating but no,he justverbally abused him a few times.Affleck's showing off in front of themirror made this truly ""Manos"" worthy!"
2,Not As Bad As Portended,"This is, by no stretch of the imagination, a good movie but then neither is it as bad as I had imagined it was going to be. All the critics were right in bashing it but, if this had been a low-budget made-for-TV movie starring 2 unknowns, I think most would have just considered it a perfectly normal waste of 2 hours TV viewing, no worse than any other. Unfortunately, this movie garnered such hype, attention, and icky ""Bennifer"" vibes that it was doomed. It's still a bad movie but I've seen worse. I bet the folks behind ""Ishtar"" were sure glad to see this movie come out and take over the mantle of worst movie ever made."
1,Gigli,"I cannot imagine how either of these artists could have ""signed on"" for such a mindless movie. There was a potential for great story line, but the ""potty-mouth"" language overpowered what story line there was. My friend and I left before it was over and by that time we didn't even care how it ended. The only reason we went in the first place was the two actors. Not much offends my sensibilities anymore, but this one did."
1,Why are films like this even made?,"One can often tell how good a movie is by looking at the price of the used movie listing Amazon provides. The lowest price I currently see is 75 cents! That pretty much sums up how bad this film is.....people are nearing the point where they will pay you to take their copy.If we added up all of the money wasted on inane Hollywood films such as this, and put them to use in more productive ways, we could have hot dog stands on Mars!"
1,thank you HBO... I got to change channels for reprieve,"I just recently saw snippets of ""Gigli"" on HBO. Basically, the money paid to Lopez and Affleck should have been donated to a worthwhile charitable institution instead and the cast (yes, that's including Al Pacino and Christopher Walken) should have their thumbs cut off by a plastic knife. Whoever planned this piece of trash thought Lopez and Affleck, both semi-interesting individuals, are an interesting couple. Lopez is incredibly unsexy and hopelessly unconvincing as a well-read, intellectual, lesbian (""you know what I mean?""); Affleck is just incredibly boring. The rest of my comments, may I say, is rendered useless by the present state of their togetherness. Turkey time, gobble, gobble."
1,Not Good At All,"The bottom line is that when Jennifer Lopez acts the whole world collapses with the misery that she is bringing us. What the hell is up with such a stupid movie? Has someone tried to make us feel pain or does the movie do its own pain? The reviews for this movie are horrible and on mostly every show they are making fun of it. Case in point, Best Week Ever, made fun of it by commemerating the year since it has come out. Oh why did I ever trick myself into going into the movie theaters and paying $20.00 for tickets and seeing a piece of crap? Let's get it straight here if you want to see it, it is only out of respect to her. But if you don't like her kind of music you might not want to see it."
4,Sweet Sound,"Since the dawn of the mp3, I have reduced the amount of CD's I actually purchase to maybe 1 a year. This CD right here was one of them. The overall sound makes you, in a word, happy. Each track managed to paint a colorful picture in my mind that danced with me to the beat. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be 'Sweet Dance,' but almost every one holds up it's own special flag. You can listen to a few tracks on YouTube. Give it a listen, and if you like what you hear, add to cart!"
3,Printer Cartridge,It is not all that great. Part of page on top and bottom get blurred out. I would not buy it again
2,Don't buy it,"The toner came dead, it couldn't print anything. This was consistent with others reviews.The only good news the refund was quick and easy. I wanted to give the seller another chance. I asked for a new toner instead of a refund .They preferred to refund my money. I have a HP 2100 i really needed a toner.I ordered from another seller recommended by another reviewer. I will update you when it arrives."
4,Great Value,"So far no complains about this re-conditioned toner cartridge. It arrived well packaged and has performed as well as a ""brand-new"" one from HP. I was skeptical, at first, since the price difference between a new cartridge and a re-conditioned one is so dramatic. I will buy these cartridges from now on, without concern."
4,As good as OEM,"good deal, a little bit ""used"" in appearance but worth the money. I just installed the cartridge so i am not sure about life expectancy yet"
5,Big savings,"Saved a lot of money by purchasing the reconditioned one over the brand name. I had been hesitant earlier, but decided to give it a try and am glad I did."
1,Returned for Refund,"I have purchased this item twice - the first worked great, but the most recent left toner smudges all over the paper. Returned for a refund and ordering a replacement from another merchant."
1,Dead Toner,We ordered this cartridge a few months before needing it. Once we did we found out that the toner would not function properly. Due to the length of time it took for us to use it we could not return it through Amazon which was reasonable. I contacted Great Toners and received an RMA number and shipping address for returning the item. One month after sending the item via USPS we received it back saying the address was not correct and that the forwarding address had expired. At this point it is not pursuing any further as we are now out the price of the toner and shipping.
3,Very Noisy,"I installed the printer cartridge and drum and quite honestly it is very noisy. It kind of whistles while it prints. It arrived very well packed and sealed. Maybe I have a bit of a dud. As to it's cost effectiveness, the price was really good, but time will tell. Don't know if the whistling will stop. Just as well I don't print as much as I used to."
4,"Ez, but not that easy","After getting the cable ready, getting the cables aligned to go through the connector can be tricky. I tried a few times with no success; sometimes the cables would bend or move out of order. It may the lack of practice than a problem with the connector itself. I am sure you may have the same issues with cheaper connectors anyway. The only advantage of using these, may be that you can see how the cables align at the end. I had cut the cables short, so I was able to push them back, once I confirmed that the cables were aligned. I didn't have to cut back the excess of cable.As far as the strain relief, I was not able to successfully lock it into position. It just went half way through. I was worried to push too hard and either brake the strain relief or the connector."
2,"Nice idea, but...","having the wires protrude from the end of the connector is a great idea. It makes the connection very tight with minimal untwisted wire. It also reduces errors by being able to see which wires are where. The problem with this connector is the position of the clip that keeps the connector in the socket. The position of the clip is such that when the wires are crimped (using a regular crimp tool), it causes the clip to be pressed against the connector thereby rendering it usesless. The resultng connector is fine, but will not stay put in the socket. If using the Platnum Tools crimp tool is a must then it should be clearly stated so. Queries to the company regarding this yielded no response whatsoever.The strain relief sleeve is very fragile and can easily be torn off the solid part."
3,"Great Idea, but...","The idea of this concept is great! However, I have found that since the output side of the connector is a slot and not 8 holes, the wires can become crossed as they are pushed through and you may not see it. I had it happen a few times. Overall, I do like them better than normal connectors but there is a little learning curve. Also, you ""MUST"" have the proper tool to cut off the extra wire when crimping. Normal crimpers have no blade on the outside end and trying to trim them by hand was almost useless. So it cost a very well made $100 extra tool."
1,Title is midleading.,"The title indicates a workbook with math problems related to electronics or electricity but the book does not contain any. The only electronics related information is how to read an analog Multimeter when measuring voltage, resistance and current. The book was of no use to me."
3,softball,"Made well, runs true to size, have lasted us 3 softball seasons and more life left in them."
5,Great sculpt!,This is very good figure as he has great sculpting and a incredible likeness as its pretty movie accurate. I recommend Marvel Movie/Marvel Legends/Spider-Man figures for age 10 and up due to the fragileness nature of the figures. Bottom line this is a must have figure if you are a big Fantastic Four fan! I strongly recommend this figure!
2,Scared to buy more,"Well, I purchased three of these. Two for my kitchen and one replaced in a bathroom recessed fixture. Both the ones in the kitchen burned out within 4 days of replacing. The one in the bathroom has only been turned on once, so not sure how that one will hold up. So, 1 out of three survived almost one week. Not much more you can review on that."
1,name class III is misleading,"even though it is classified as class III, its maximum towing weight is only 3500lb and tongue weight is 300lb. that is what class II hitches do. you cannot tow most boats bigger than 18ft."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"This is awesome, it is concealable under a jacket or baggy sweater for safe keeping. The discreteness of this item is what is attracting the most."
4,No leaks,"Great leather, no leaks, but cheap bottle cop. Ship was fast. I only used for water. No alcohol or wine. And for the price is great"
2,The search continues...,Not quite what I expected in terms of quality. The nicest part of the bag are the leather sides. Everything else is a cheap plastic. Disappointed that amazon only features one style and color to choose from.
5,Crickle Crack,"I'm a 16 year old girl and I still love these books. Crickle Crack was a good one, dealing with problems in today's society. A squirrel is told to stay away from the crickle crack tree and he doesn't listen. The blossoms bring poor squeakers trouble when he eats them. The books are really timeless."
5,Amazing quality!,"Some fun music vidios from before there were music vidios. Very fun clips, with very good quality, to go with performances by these too groups. It's definitely a fun part of my collection!"
2,Outdated and Way Behind the Power Curve,Lemay wouldn't know current Web publishingand design issues if they introduced themselvesto her. I must say I was extremely disappointed.Definitely NOT a good choice if you want to learn anything beyond the basics.
4,Great introduction to HTML as well as a reference guide.,"This edition offers a wealth of information and is fairly current. The lessons are divided into a logical and easy to follow format although it is hard to keep up with her pace. I kept falling behind, sometimes by days. See if you can keep up. The only other criticism would be the lack of proper proofreading as there seems to be an abundance of typos and other errors"
2,Not as useful as I thought it would be.,"Very disorganized. Beyond HTML topics, there's not a whole lot that makes sense. I must say that I was disappointed"
2,Proof-positive that PIGS can fly!,"Despite all the hoopla I must say this is a poorly written book. Lemay doesn't have a clue. Why the heck anyone would pay double for this inflated paperback I will never know, but I do know this I won't buy any other books by Ms. Lemay"
2,Tired & Worn,This book is a great BIG yawn that covers the basics of HTML...Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Harr
1,Lemay = Lame,"Can you say HYPE? Can you say BORING? Can you say not worth your hard earned cash?I don't know about you but I am tired of buying paperweights AND this book is definitely little more than a dressed up paperweight, a very expensive dressed up paperweight. Lemay may know the basics, but the technology revolution has left her and her ideas behind in the dust."
4,"As a ""HTML beginner"", I found this book to be very helpful.","Ever since learning MS DOS, I've enjoyed plowing through ""How-to"" books about various aspects of computing. If you like to learn this way, Laura Lemay's HTML book is great. It takes a lot longer than 14 days (unless you have absolutely nothing else to do, and fantastic powers of concentration) but you will learn the basics of HTML 3.2. My advice is to work through the examples on your computer, rather than just read through the book like a novel, and check Lemay's Web page for corrections!I have seen courses advertised at an Australian University for $2 000 (Australian) that don't teach much more than this book. At $100 (Australian) this book is a bargain."
1,Tired and worn and boring,"I have to agree with previous reviewers who said this book just doesn't add up. This book is hardly an exhaustive look at HTML 3.2 or a exhaustive look at anything for that matter. This book is very confusing and poorly written. I recommend looking elsewhere. Two good HTML books come to mind:William Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Professional ReferenceHTML The Definitive GuideHTML SourcebookOoops that's three, isn't it? Out of all those I think I like William Stanek's book the best. You be da judge."
1,"THEY DON'T WORK, AND AMAZON WILL NOT REFUND","I have always used Epson brand cartridges with great success in my Epson printer. I finally took a flyer on this non-Epson replacement cartridge, as it ran about half what the Epson cartridges do. I had it sitting by my printer for a couple of months until my color cartridge ran out. When I replaced the Epson cartridge with the Amazon cartridge, the Amazon cartridge gummed up the nozzles. They would not clean. This is a printer that worked flawlessly for seven years on Epson cartridges. I may end up having to replace the printer. And Amazon would not take the cartridges back, as I had had them for over 30 days."
4,Dragons Up & Soaring,This book is beautifully illustrated capturing the attention of both my 8 year and my teenager. The advanture of this little dragon and his companion is fanciful and delightful. The characters are sweet and interesting.

2,Save Your Money,"This dvd is not in colour like amazon claims, but rather in black and white. It is just a collection of poor quality black and white videos. Definitely not worth the $16.00. Although there is one good song with Dean and Jerry Lewis."

2,"Nice features, looks nice, falls apart","I do a lot of skiing, biking & outdoor activities and this looked like the perfect watch to have. It is. The watch has lots of great features for tracking vertical feet skied, checking the altitude and things like that. Unfortunately the plastic piece around the face of the watch near the band peels off the face of the watch. This was after about a year of wearing it when skiing and biking as well as daily use. While this doesn't make it unusable, you just don't expect a relatively high end watch to fall apart.Despite the nice menu of features and otherwise quality construction, if you want a watch that has great features, looks nice and does not come apart you should look elsewhere."
2,Don't get this watch!,"I ordered and received this watch in May 2007 and by November 2007 the plastic band attachment point on the watch (where the little pin fits) broke completely off. If this had been a break in the band itself it would be repairable but a watch repair person said there is no way to repair this. Of course, because this was past the 30 day return policy for Amazon, I now have a fairly expensive piece of junk. I will never buy a Highgear product again."
2,Poor construction quality,"I had this watch for a little over 1 year before the band broke where the pins connect the band to the watch face. This area of the watch is made of a hard rubber. The problem with that is this: if you catch the watch face on something like a door frame (like I did)...or anything else...the strap doesn't just pop off the face...the pins actually ripped through the rubber. So even a new band doesn't help because there is no way to secure it to the face - it just keeps popping off. For a $150+ watch, I would expect much better. The functions of the watch were great, it just didn't last long at all."
1,Leaky!!!,"My wife bought me an Alterra for Christmas last year. For the most part I was happy with it. I had a few problems with the stop watch not working correctly, no big deal. This morning I found moisture inside the display. I never opened the case, yet it allowed water inside. Not very impressive. I expected better from a 130 dollar watch."
3,Good watch but quality lacking,"Great watch. Had it for about two years now. Worn it while trekking in Peru (Inca Trail), Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, etc....Trick is to calibrate it often - like most barometric watches...Quality is an issue with the watch though. After a few months of wearing it, the rubber surrounds of the watch started to separate from the casing!!! Customer service is excellent from Highgear though. They replaced it with a new watch after I sent the old one to them. No questions asked (except for proof of purchase)..."
4,A great tool for alpine sports......but not perfect,"I picked this watch up for half price and it seemes like a fun gadget to use for my skiing and mountain bike ventures. It took a little while to get the watch's functions figured out and dialed in, but once the functions are mastered its a very useful too.Pros:-east to read face, simple to operate considering how many uses it has.-great for predicting snow, rain, thanks to the alitmeter, barometer.-ski chrono is great for backcountry ski trips.-very accurate compass in invaluable.-will actually store data.Cons:-Needs to be recalibrated daily in order for all functions to work.-Thermometer only works off your wrist. When on your wrist it reflects your body temp as well as air temp so it will read 15% or so higher.I wouldn't pay $180 for this but considering I picked it up for half that, its a fun tool to use in the backcountry and can even get you back to your car if you're lost and being able to see bad weather coming could save you a$$ too."
2,Beware!,"If you do not buy this watch from one of the retailers listed on High Gear's website, the watch is not warrantied! Their customer service is exceptionally unhelpful. The quality is poor enough you will need the warranty...or look at another brand.I had a problem with the buttons not working, so I contacted High Gear for a return authorization number. They refused the return authorization under warranty because ""it was not purchased from an authorized High Gear dealer"". Who knew? I perused their website with this new tidbit of information, and did not see Amazon listed as an ""authorized on-line dealer"". I contacted the BBB, and they were unable to convince High Gear to honor the warranty."
3,Band falls apart,"I echo some of the other comments that noted problems with the wristband on this watch. On this watch and others like some of the Nike Triax, the watch has a rubber/plastic piece that runs around the perimeter of the watch and connects with the band. On mine, the point of connection between the watch and band deteriorated after 1-2 years. I understand it can't be fixed. So the watch is useless. Up until this, it had worked pretty well."
2,Poor Quality for a nice watch,"I bought this watch because I am a weather enthusiast and was impressed with the barometer and temperature functions. It works well for both those and the altimeter, if you calibrate correctly and often. However after a year of normal use (nothing extreme) the rubber piece that goes around the watch started peeling off. I sent it in under warranty and received my watch back with new trim. After another year, it did it again. Unfortunately, this time it was not under warranty. I would not buy this watch again."
1,poor quality,"I dropped this watch from about 2 - 3 feet in my room, and it broke into several pieces. I figure I would put more abuse on it outdoors than that.I assume a ""sports"" watch would be made to last longer than that.If you buy it make sure to get some bubble wrap for it too."
1,SORRY I EVER BOUGHT THIS. NEVER WORKED RIGHT,Unfortunately I didn't keep the wrapping or this player would have been returned. It never worked properly and makes me very wary of buying electronic over the net. I certainly have learned to keep the wrapping for a long time. buyer beware. don't buy this item. even if it did work it's not easy to use. I think it's a factory defect. I would give it no stars if that were possible.
5,The Bible for Organic Laboratory,"I took an undergraduate course on advanced organic laboratory method and Vogel was meant to be an incredible reference and life-saver. The overwhelming size of the book might seem somewhat frightening yet the useful information is worth the size and money.Pavia's ""Introduction to Organic Laboratory Techniques"" might seem to be a water-down version of Vogel. Vogel is extremely well-written and detailed in laboratory tecniques such as chromatography, distillation, HPLC, crystallization, extraction, etc. A chapter is also devoted to discussion of solvents and reagents, which helps tremendously for separation experiments.Vogel also discusses aliphatic, heterocyclic, and aromatic compounds and introduces spectroscopic methods. Vogel is recommended for advanced lab course that requires frequent modification of lab procedures and reference for chemists."
3,Time for a new edition,This book is really good but it's time for a new edition ! Compared to another excellent book (Jerry March) it is also too expensive. I would give 5 stars to a new and cheaper edition.
5,Deeply Moving,"This book is so poignant and lovingly crafted that I cried. The writing is beautiful as is the way this story unfolds, and what this family goes through in a time when AIDS was not accepted is angering.After reading this book, I dreamt that I was diagnosed with AIDS . . . definately not a pick-me-up, but a poignant and tumultuous tale."
4,"Amenda, Polly,Ivan,Charlie,Claire,Al are BREAKING UP!","his is a really cool book! Polly had a perfect life. but when her daughter was dignosed with AIDS. She found out that life really stinks sometime.Most people in the town of Morrow hated Polly and his family when they knew that Amenda had had AIDS. They tried to get away from her and despise her family. Two people I found really distasteful was Betsy and Linda the principal.Yet, Ed Rearden was the one who held the family together, he worked day and night with Amenda and size=1><i~{`F"
3,Cliched plot and characters overshadows great writing piece,"It's a shame. Amazing writing by Hoffman here can't overcome the overdone plot; and characters. This book would have had so much more of an effect on me if I cared more about the characters, but they've been done so many time you can telegraph the punches of every person and event. An AIDS patient who helps the family; a kid who is infatuated with dinasaurs; overbearing and overcaring parents; all been done. It still works pretty well though and it's easy to read, so a 6 is what it gets from me."
1,At Risk,"We had to read this book in my language arts class, and frankly I was very dissapointed. The book sounded like it was going to have a very good story line. The book was unexciting and not particularly well written, and I am usually used to strong books, as I read plenty of adult books as well. Even I say this, along with many others, in saying this book was a little too strong to be classified as a children's book. I think the swearing gets tiring after a while, and I do not like the characters in the book very much, except for the protagonist Amanda. Polly is quite annoying!!!!!"
1,the worst book ever,"i think this book was the worst one i have ever saw. i have seen books with characters and books with action,drama,romance,and horor but this book made no sense it was a stupid book about a girl whos dreams were lost because of aids and if anybody who read this book had aids there dreams of living would be shattered into a million piecies.thats why i think this book his horrible!"
3,At Risk is a great book and I recommend it to anyone!,"I really enjoyed At Risk. I wasn't going to read it, but my friend told me how great it was and now I am so glad that I did. It was such a sad book and at some points I felt like I was actually in their family. Some parts were dragging but overall it was great. I had a problem with the path that the author chose to take in some parts. In a way, I wanted something more to happen with the mom and the doctor. That situation was basically just forgotten. Other than these FEW things, I thought the book was pretty good and I recommend it to anyone, especially someone going through the same situation."
5,my eyes were glued,"At Risk is a very good book. An affecting novel of exquisite,delicay,with humor,warmth,and sensitivity. I recomend this book to carieng people. This book is heart-warming. It is one of the best novels I have ever read. The little girl in the story inspires me do try with all I can. I also recomend You read all of Alice Hoffman's books."
4,"unavailable but now reissued as ""Elman Plays Hebrew Melodies""","This original CD reissue, from 1993, is no more available, and the Vanguard catalog has been purchased by Artemis Records, a New-York based label, which has reissued it as Vanguard Classics ATM-CD-1882, titled ""Elman Plays Hebrew Melodies"". Don't be mislead: though it is indicated nowhere, neither on CD cover, booklet nor on the CD itself, the 4 Russian items are also included in the new reissue, so if you are interested (these are essentially Jewish trifles, but Elman plays with chic and fine tone, and the sound of these 1959 to 1966 recordings is fine, with near imperceptible tape hiss), you can safely go for it. See my review of the recent reissue for more details, underElman Plays Hebrew Melodies."
3,Language selection frustration,"While I appreciate that this newer model has volume control, what about a English/Spanish switch? It seems tedious, not to mention a bit hard for a new user, to press a button at a certain moment to select a language EVERY TIME she starts the computer. Also, the game switch is hard to move."
2,English/Spanish switch is ridiculous!,we bought this for our 3 1/2 year old daughter and we might as well put this one on the won't play with shelf. the spanish/english button is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. They should have it somewhere that a parent can do it but not rely on the children to pick a language. Dur?
2,Small screen,"I bought this for my granddaughter and was shocked when I opened the toy and saw the tiny screen. The toy is the size of a computer but the screen is about 3""x3"". The slide that moves from one game to the other is difficult to move and I wonder just how long it will last. The pink screen is very dark and hard to see in certain conditions. Poor choice on my part."
4,My grandaughter loves this!,"My 4 year old grandaughter loves this toy. She carries it with her where ever and when ever she can. She told me it was her ""bestest Christmas gift"" which is saying something as it wasn't on her list and she got the two things she most wanted. I recommend this toy highly for curious and intelligent children from ages three to six."
4,à bien y penser...,"Je ne sais pas si cet ensemble Rubin atteint les hautes sphèresdes Julliard, Alban Berg et autres.Cepandant, compte tenu du prix , qualité de son, exécution,ce disque vaut certainement la peine d'tre comparé aux autres versions."
4,A Good Read,"I grew up about a half-mile from the home of D.C. Stephenson, the 1920s grand wizard for the KKK in Indiana, and had heard tales about the power of the Klan during those times. This is a history of the third wave of Klan. The Klan was extremely powerful in Indiana during those times. In fact political offices in Indianapolis and the state government were controlled by the Klan. If they did not endorse you, you did not win. Especially poignant is the history of the downfall of the Klan (caused by the the brutal death of a young woman at the hands of Stephenson). A good read if you are interested in this era."
4,Photo Feast,This is a nice little book giving a really good photographic record of Michael Schumacher's F1 career from his early days with Jordan Ford in 1991 to the end of 2003. The photos are great in this book as are the year by year design drawings of the various cars he has driven. The information is in both English and German and is quite informative except for a gross error on page 131 where a photo showing the accident at the start of the Melbourne 2002 GP between Ferraris' Rubens Barrichello and Williams' Ralf Schumacher was incorrectly described as having Rubens landing on top of Ralf when in fact it was the other way round. Other than that it is a book I am glad to own as the photos by Paolo D'Alessio are just fabulous
4,The past and the present in collision,"With the TARDIS under attack, the unexpected collision with an early time vessel from Gallifrey's past seemingly destroys the TARDIS and Ace awakes in a strange city under attack from a thing known as ""the Process""...Written by Marc Platt, probably best known to Doctor Who fans as the scripter of the late classic 'Ghost Light', this book is the first in the very loose Cat's Cradle trilogy and features a substantial look at the prehistory of Gallifrey, the Doctor's home planet.Reasonably complicated in structure (the behaviour of some of the characters is determined by complicated matters that become plainer towards the end of the book), it helps fill out the background of the Doctor's people while involving the Doctor and Ace in a seriously threatening adventure.All in all, a worthwhile read, but it requires concentration."
2,BORING,"My Own Two Feet is a never-ending narrative of a woman forced to pinch pennies. She writes as though she were a long-suffering victim when she had the full support of her family, yet she gives herself all the credit in the end. Entirely devoid of depth, she didn't hold my interest or earn my sympathy."
4,Pretty Good,"Read this for book club and thought it was pretty good. I think there is a book about her life that she wrote before (or after) this that might answer some more questions. but all in all, it was pretty interesting"
4,A nice read,"This story continues where ""A GIrl From Yamhill"" left off. It's an interesting continuation of Beverly Cleary's autobiography.I enjoyed it, but not quite as much as ""A Girl From Yamhill""; this one just seemed to jump around a bit more. Still, like I said, it's a nice read. Enjoy!"
2,Other than a great book...,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. First of all, all of the reviews were so strong. Secondly, because I grew up in Pomona, I knew I would recognize many of the places that she would be writing about.I just felt that this was such a simple story...no depth to the tale at all. It almost reminded me of something that might be written by a high school student.I wonder why I feel so differently about the book?"
1,waste of money,"After a couple hundred pages this cartridge started streaking all over the page. Unfortunate for me, I bought 2 at the same time. Both did same thing."
4,"It's very good, but still a little disappointment","This is indeed a very good album also. But the earlier album ""King Fear"" was such a masterpiece that this one actually was a little disappointment.""Lucibel"" and ""Mother of Serpents"" are highlights of this album."
4,Action packed & fun to read,"This is the first book (other than short picture books) my son (5 1/2) was motivated enough to read on his own (of course he needed help with a few words). Hard to tell until you read it that it's continued in another book & there's no mention of which book is the sequel (it's Grand Tournament). I had to get on the Amazon site & read descriptions of all the Knight's Kingdom books to figure that out since this is the only book identified numerically ""#1"". Kind of annoying that they didn't make this clearer. But it's a great book for boys & as soon as we got the sequel he read right through that also. He's never seen the Lego toys that go with it so it's not necessary to enjoy the book."
4,an old family treasure,"I grew up with this lively recording, so am quite nostalgic about it. The sound quality doesn't quite stand the test of time, but they sing these (mostly classic) Israeli popular songs with great energy. I defy you not to jump up and start dancing around the room."
1,not particularily informative,"I had this book for a college class and it is terrible. I found it to be very, very vague on it's topics and just barely skims the surface. The diagrams are drawings, and they are not very good for the representation. If you want to learn about equine science, this is not the book."
2,Don't expect too much on this book,"If you are a developer and eager to find resource on Java Mobile development, this book must disappoint you. This book just give you a general java mobile concept. May be this technology is too green so that all topics are not in depth to discuss with very limited examples.The worse of this book is some examples just show the source code only with no any demonstration of the program running or even the complied result and that made people hard to understand what the source code mean.If you see the content that this book cover MIDP for Palm. Don't believe this, this book is only cover the early stage of java KVM in Palm but not included the current Sun MIDP for Palm OS"
1,What a Lousy Book!!!,This is the worst book I have read so far. There are so many errors in the book! And all descriptions about J2ME are vague. It's really a pity that I spent my money on this useless book.Don't buy this book!!!
4,Nice Renditions Of Songs That Were Hits For Others,"As with the CD America Swings: Great Big Band Singers, this too came out about 16/17 years ago from Hindsight Records which owns the rights to close to 9,000 selections, primarily from the Big Band Era. But with just 12 tracks, most of them unfamiliar to the average fan of the music of the Swing Era, tt's not surprising that this remains largely ignored. However, if what you are seeking is simply a sampling of some of the better female vocalists of that bygone age, and don't mind that none of these were ever hit versions, it does offer good sound quality, liner notes by noted broadcaster Dr. Herb Wong, also a writer for Downbeat and the Jazz Educators Journal, and a reasonable price."
1,A waste of money,"I didn't care for any of the pieces in this book. They are repetitious and not very melodic, in my opinion. Just not my cup of tea."
3,"Well, let's talk about this, please...","The problem with Erica Jong's popularity is that so many white males (John Updike, Anthony Burgess, etc.) welcomed her book 'Fear of Flying'. On the other hand, without crediting those white males with any real discernment of feminist daring, let's remember that it was such people who got the book on the best seller list. Jong is infinitely more talented than those writers, but this book seems to be unable to articulate this simple truth. Let's remember, then, that it is clueless white males who advocate books by George Orwell, John Steinbeck, etc. Erica Jong is courageous and challenges eurocentric patriarchy, something those other writers did not do, and are now irrelevant because of it. Besides which, Jong isn't really *all that* radical a feminist anyway. She has been trivialized by being afflicted with white male enthusiasm, but no one can forget that her books are momentous because they are so individual, as all Women are."
3,Es un libro que incita a la exploración personal,"La Casa en Mango Street provoca en el lector la voluntad de analizar aquellos sucesos que al parecer son cotidianos y simples pero en realidad dejan una huella en la vida de aquéllos que los experimentan.A través de éstos la narradora, Esperanza, relata una etapa de su vida (técnica utilizada a la perfección por la autora). La contemplación de las nubes, la visita a un colmado, etc. cumplen con este fin. Para los lectores jóvenes podría servir como fotografía de algunos problemas que enfrentan hoy (como por ejemplo el embarazo en jóvenes).En resumen, este es un libro recomendable pues combina varias técnicas literarias, pero es el estilo de la narración lo que lo hace uno muy innovador y le ganan a la autora otro acierto en su profesión."
2,If you speak English...,"I recommend reading this book in English. Because the author uses some Spanish or Spanglish in the original version, the Spanish translation is hard to understand at times."
4,My Personal Review on The House on Mango Street,"The book, House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros is an interesting book. I really do not understand why on some of the critiques people say they did not understand the book. I think it is very meaningful book. If you pay attention to it, there are many messages that Sandra Cisneros wrote on her book. I like this book very much because there are some stories that relate to my life, and I understand the concept of what she is talking about on her book. If there is, one thing that I did not like was that the book has many characters that I have to keep up."
2,Los cuentos de una chica triste,"Este libro cuenta la historia de una cordera en la ciudad de gente con hombros anchos. Esperanza Cordero, la protagonista, nos dice de la historia triste de una hispanohablante la que enfrenta el desafío de su adolescencia de pobreza en el barrio de Chicago en Mango Street. Ella está desfeliz con todas las cosas: su casa, su pobreza y la vida triste del pueblo en este barrio. Es una historia como mil otras. En este sentido es un cuento más común, por lo tanto lo merece un dos."
1,Man hater,I personally think that Sandra Cisneros wrote this book for the female audience. She seems to be some sort of a man hater. I guess she really does not like men in any kind of fasion. So for all you man haters this is a good book for you. Everyene else stay away. A better book would be the dictionary
4,Students Seem to Like It,"I myself found this book to be okay, but my junior high school students (native speakers) seem to really like it."
2,not bilingual,"I ordered this audio CD because the description said it was the Spanish and English edition. I was planning on using the English version for my ESL students to follow along with, however, it is only the Spanish version. Other people who reviewed this product wrote about how it was bilingual so I expected that. For those of you who purchased this, how many CDs did you receive? I got 2 in 1 CD case, but no English version. Disappointed."
4,Great CD -- others out there slipping away!,"This is a great CD and a great way to become familiar with the Oz group. Quite accessible, with patience!If you can find it, try BLOW UP THE POKIES! Hard to find (try eBay) but worth the search.Check this great group out!"
3,"Adequate, nothing more","This is the 3rd release from Sydney based band The Whitlams. Like before this is a variety of rockabily fusing funk, rock and other elements. This makes them stand out a bit more than fellow Aussie acts. However, this release doesn't stand out when compared to their previous effort Eternal Nightcap in terms of compelling songs or consistency. Nightcap had several moments that drew you right in, but this one just happily cruises along. I get the impression that this band is happy being a background kind of an act, playing in pubs, weddings and other functions while the rest of us order our last drink for the night. The first 8 tracks are pleasant thought not really compelling in any way, while the reminder of the album really sinks into the sunset.In short, this effort is well produced, pleasant in parts, but is also uninspired. They fell into the trap like other acts by including too much material on one album. Less songs and less filler would have been better."
1,You've got to be kidding,Were we listening to the same CD! Chunky Chunky air guitar? This man's voice is so tuneless and whiny! The lyrics are embarrassingly stupid and each and every note grates on my nerves and threatens my very soul! I hate this album!
4,"Finally, Questions laid to Rest.","After being a Amityville follower for many years, I have talked to Mr. Osuna via email, on several occasions, and just wanted to let him know, what a great job he did in reporting the real facts concerning many questions we all have had concerning the Amityville tradegy. We all have read the previous books, seen the movies, and heard the tales of the Lutz family. I finally feel a sense of peace knowing what really happend on the night of November 13, 1974. I never did believe that Butch did the entire crime himself, he would have had to be a superman or something, but the deed itself, is still hard to believe. I hope Ric does well with the book, and I feel if you are a Amityville follower, this is definitely a book to put on your list. Enjoy the reading, it is hard to put down.Thanks again, Ric.TDrum Upstate New York"
4,This is a good book,"The DeFeos can finally rest in peace, Ronnie DeFeo may not be completely innocent because he did kill his sister and had a slight hand in ending his families life, But now we know it was the sister Dawn that killed the family.Ric Osuna investigation was complete and thorough and should finally put to rest alot of the myths and stories surrounding Amityville. The house itself stands today and is absolutely beautiful.May Ron DeFeos wife and child have a happy life."
2,Whatever,"This book is obviously about 90% fabricated. I only have a casual relationship with the subject matter and even I can tell the entire Geraldine/Ronnie being married in 1974 thing is made up. The author succeeds in proving nothing. This book belongs on the fiction shelf, next to Anson's original Amityville."
3,Twisted story from twisted witness...all in for money....,"I thought I would learn something new that would be credible.... Nice try but there's not much in there that really proove that he haven't done this only with his sister and killed her after. Still hungry...What I liked though, is the fact that no witness/relatives through the book talked about the devil, fairies and other childish stuff. It does describe a human tragedy that even the murderer is now unsure how it happened..."
1,Not very happy...,"I bought this book a while back and am very disappointed in it. The author claims to have evidence and documents to back up his outlandish claims, but doesn't include ANY of this evidence or documentation in the book...as if we were suppose to just ""take his word on it"". It's an interesting book of fiction..that's about it."
4,A Night Of Horror,I just finished this book it is very interesting and gives you a whole new look at the Amityville story.I gave this book four stars because some parts about the court section was a bore but overall the book was pretty good. it is not a ghost story but a true horror story. the book tells us what really went on in the DeFeo family.The book also tells us how the whole Amityville horror story was put togetherby George and Kathy Lutz over a few bottles of wine. This book does explain a lot and makes a lot of sense. I always thought the Amityville Horror story was in part a true story but after reading this book I just do not know anymore.
3,A good book,This book is ideal for anyone wanting an alternative take on the Amityville story.Not exactly sure how much of this is true. Mr Osuna has been labelled a liar by Butch Defeo and his wife Tracey for the way he has portrayed the story of his family. Still a good book though and definitley gives you something to think about.
3,still left me wondering,This book was well done except for still unanswered questions I just felt the author should have done somewhat better even tho I still enjoyed it
3,"Not as good as ""High Hopes""","While Ric Osuna's book is interesting reading for those who like true crime, he ""sugar-coats"" Butch DeFeo's personality. If you read ""High Hopes,"" especially the chapters on the trial, you will see Butch's court testimony, where he does not come off as the ""nice family guy"" that Osuna wishes Butch to be, but instead a stone cold killer, who evens threatens to kill the prosecutor during the trial. Some interesting things come to light in Osuna's book; but I also find it impossible to believe that the mob and the police were working together in a cover-up of the supposed ""truth"" of the murders."
3,Needs more,I was somewhat dissapointed with this book. I was looking for more fact as opposed to Rick Osuna's opinion. It was an interesting book to read. The chapter about police brutality could have been kept out. That definately would have made it more readable. Would have also liked more pictures of the DeFeo family aside from portraits.
1,The Worse Amityville Book Ever,"This book is the worse piece of self serving trash that I have ever read, or purchased. It offers no evidence, only opinions. Even worse the author actually seems to be defending the actions of Ronald Defeo, Jr!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,one sided.,"This book was from the point a view of someone who was on drugs and clearly not someone that is trust worthy. Since he is the only survivor of the family how are we to really know what is true. As soon as I got to the "" corruption of the police department"" I had to stop reading it. Cuz I felt how can u believe someone who killed his parents with no remorse."
3,Not Quite There,I think the author did a good job digging up much Defeo family dirty laundry. The relationship between Big Ronnie and the rest of the family no doubt was stressed due to the fact his father in law and employer Michael Brigante's generosity was the main reason for the family's prosperity. Big Ronnie was of the generation of Italian Americans where the man worked and was the breadwinner. The thing this book does accomplish is the Defeos were a more or less ordinary Italian American family with the same problems that affected similar families. I think Ronald Sr and Louise blundered by not getting Ronnie Jr Professional help sooner. His father hot and cold attitude toward him and his later drug use created the perfect storm that resulted in the tragedy.
1,Pure and Utter Nonsense,"This book was a total disappointment and contributes virtually nothing to the debate over what happened in amityville. I expected at least a minimal level of scholarship. Instead, we get pure speculation. There is no critical analysis of Butch's version of the murders, which the author, to his discredit, accepts without hesitation. Osuna's reliance on Defeo's ""wife"" is equally preposterous. She claims to be virtually everywhere and know everyone involved in the story; you would expect that the author would find someone who could corroborate at least portions of her story. Again, some critical thinking on the author's part would be helpful. And the writing is simply awful. Didn't anyone proofread the thing? I completely wasted my money on this dog. I don't even want to give the book one star."
4,Interesting read,"I saw the movie ""The Amityville Horror"" as a kid and was as scared as any kid would be. This book tells the story of what lead up to the events that happened in that house, which is much more interesting and intriguing. Well worth the read"
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author has based his entire premise on a lady who is clearly a fraud. This ""lady"" is a criminal and obviously a very lonely, desperate person. She is the sort who seeks out relations with incarcerated convicts (murderers) and hordes dogs and cats in her welfare obtained apartment to the point of animal abuse. The other person who contributed to this book is Butch Defeo himself. A man who has admitted to killing his entire family in cold blood. At least in one of the many, many versions of his ever changing story. Despite, the dubious sources, the person really at fault for this terrible book is the author, who bases his revisionalist history of a terrible crime on statements from two pathological liars. Unfortunately, those who could refute this new unbelievable account of the murders are all dead. A fact, well understood by the author, I'm sure.."
1,Uncredicle (not incredible) author,"The author of this book is very uncredible- he flipped back and forth on the issue of whether the house was haunted and even at one time proclaimed on his website that he had proof that it was. [...] Now where I believe the entire story was a hoax, I cannot accept this man's work as fact."
4,Are we any closer to the truth?,"As a Long Islander who grew up with the books, the movies and the myths, this book caught my attention enough to actually make it the first true crime book I've ever read.At best, THE NIGHT THE DEFEOS DIED is an entertaining, page-turning read. However, because the book deals mostly with facts that are derived from murderer Butch DeFeo, whom the author admit has lied many times over to accomodate his situations and circumstances, the accounts of what happend the night the DeFeos died can only be concluded as another version of what happened and not necessarily the truth.In the end, I felt I learned more truths about George and Kathy Lutz and the con artists that they were when they concocted the entire hoax that would become the Amityville horror legend.So as I said; entertaining, yes. Truth? Not necessarilty. Just another version of what COULD have happened. Like the Kennedy assassination, we may never know what really happened the night the DeFeos died."
2,The Conspiracy Continues,"I really thought when i had stumbed onto the authors website that finally someone was going to find the truth in this ""going on 30 yr old case"". Enough evidence is present to justify that Ronald Defeo Jr. did not act alone in these murders, this however is OLD NEWS!! This entire book is based on the story of a woman who ""claims"" she was married to Defeo when the murders took place and that mob members destroyed all records of the marriage to protect her identity, OMG, is she related to the Lutz's??? From what rock did she ""levitate"" from under??? None the less folks, it is an ok read and a must for any ""amityville"" book collection, other than that dont get to many ""high hopes"" as to many more facts on this case beside the fact there is still some money to be made from this unfortunate event!! Peace, Ken"
3,Not all that great,All it is is a uni-sex T-shirt with smaller sleaves. No more. There are places where I can just get a uni-sex T for nearly a third the price.
3,OK for women and kids - not recommended for men,"These are thin and for the body of a woman or kid/teen. The neck opening is too large and the sleeve length is too short. These can be found for 3.00 or less, anything more is a ripoff. The best T-Shirt's I have found have been by ProClub, Shaka, Triple 777, Noiz and Top Ace."
2,ick,"listed as 100% cotton, but it either is really a blend or has some kind of chemical additive that stops it from breathing. Very uncomfortable in hot weather. I threw it out after wearing it for an hour."
1,Nice idea but terrible product,Thought these would be a great alternative to the paper and styrofoam cup we go through. Turned out to be flimsy and the lip of the cups are rough. Definitely would not recommend this product.
2,A sponge!,These are just awful. They absorb your hot beverage and become mushy and they are too hot to handle without doubling up. The rim is rough on your lips and it tastes nasty to boot.
2,"OK, but still not feasible for most consumers","These cups are OK, but very expensive when compared with ""less greener"" alternatives like Styrofoam, plus thay do become soggy after a while, so their performance is middling at best."
2,"Tricky, Sticky, and Icky - but Cute.","There is a trick to prying these apart, and once you get it figured out it's pretty easy. But - by then - you've destroyed half of them. Instead of pulling one out of another, use your fingertips to push it up from the folded rim. Voila!But that won't fix the fact that they leave a strange taste in your mouth (with a cold or hot drink).This company sells other products that are far more worthwhile, but they haven't mastered this cup yet.Still, if it's looks you're after, I do like the look of these. They have a nice natural color, and they're definitely sturdy enough to handle most drinks."
2,These cups are not very useful,"I was disappointed. These cups pinch from side to side when I pick them up from the top so then can only be picked up from the bottom. They are not insulative at all. The cups will be as hot as the liquid in them. I will keep them and use them for certain situations, but I don't recommend them. I would rate them ""practically useless""."
5,Incredible Radar Detector for an incredible deal!,"Clearly the best radar detector. Includes SWS (Safety WarningSystem) and alerts of potential road/highway/weather hazards near you.It detects radars on every level possible (X, K, Ka) and does a superb job filtering out the unwanted signals (supermarkets, banks, garage door openers) and handles police radars like a champion. It also includes VG-2, so police won't know you even HAVE one! It hides itself. More features include dimming of console at night to keep it private, very loud to very soft sound volumes, and it speaks! It tells you in voice of potential danger and many other alerts. The voice is clear to hear and understand. It comes with every accessory needed to mount on windshield, dash, or visor. A super radar detector also detects 360 degrees around your vehicle! Not just the front or back. You're protected all around, with a very good ""field of view."" Having this product, I feel very safe and secure knowing I'm protected by the best!"
4,Bel 870 Radar/Laser Detector,"Very pleased with the unit. Quite sensitive and provides more than ample warning for any reasonable driver. Digital display is good, easy to interpret. Voice signal could be louder. SWS is nice feature. Got good advanced warning of accident scene."
3,My opinion,"real basic model, much to sensitive, way to many false alarms! try valentine one a much superior radar detector, a bit more money, but worth it. 360 protection, arrows pointing in front or rear or side detection."
5,Outstanding!!,"I absolutely love this CD and regret ever loaning it out to someone who lost it. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE IT!!! If you know of someone who has a copy and would be willing to sell it, please have them visit Amazon.com."
5,"Best for car camping, as it weighs 8.5 lbs, not 3.5 lbs","I bought 2 of these from Costco. The fleece lining (which is removable) feels wonderful. I love how roomy it is. But it is BIG and BULKY so it's best for car camping. My 7-year-old son loves to sleep in it on the floor of his room. I know you can put 2 like bags (zip them together) to make one big bag. Haven't tried that yet, but I will on our next camping trip if it gets too cold."
2,Boring,"The only good thing about this dvd was the cars airbrushed paint jobs, the porn convention scene and that was it, besides that it didn't have any good racing, if your looking for racing action, come down to MO where it is at, my recomendation is don't get this lame ass dvd."
5,I found a hidden tresure,"Upon searching far and wide, I finally found a copy of this CD. I purchased it mainly for my elderly parents but I too found it to be a great CD set.My parents loved it beyond measure. There are many French classics featured here. Liane has her own style and her voice flow with the music. There is quite a bit of well played piano and accordians. You feel like you just visited France after hearing this. I highly reccomend it."
1,Paris Midnight 50 French hits,I am very disappointed in this CD and disappointed in the reviews that led me to buy it. I wanted a definative collection of the many french songs that have become popular and well-known even here in the states. This CD sounds very amaturish. The lead in to every song is the same. The whole songs are not sung in many cases. It sounds like someone with a tape recorder stood in the back of a second rate nightclub. I paid $30 for this karaoke performance *sigh* What a rip off.
4,"Traditional but not ""old""","This CD took me back to France. I love French music, but I normally buy variété franaise, a more contemporary sounding music. But I always wanted a CD of the traditional French chanson. From the first song, I got a big grin on my face because I knew that I had made the right choice. I highly recommend it to people who are venturing into buying their first French CD or to French music lovers. You will not be disappointed with this choice."
5,rEVIEW OF PARIS MIDNIGHT,"This collection of French songs, beautifully sung by Liane, is a pleasure to listen to. Most of the bestsongs are on disc 1, and ""les feuilles mortes"" is on both discs. Otherwise it is perfect."
1,Quick review but it might just confuse you,"Easy read/review of geometry, but so many mistakes in the proofs that it doesn't seem like anyone edited the thing."
3,Book is adequate,This boox is adequate for Honors students...Try find some other book.But it's really good for practice
2,Not very helpful,"I purchased this book to be a refresher for me in Geometry for prep for my GMAT. I was just looking for the basics and some sample problems.This book does go over the basics but fails to provide sample problems and does not give many examples, only illustrations to explain a concept.I also found the book to be a lot of 'filler' for example there is a chapter that mentioned ""cool careers that use geomtry""The final chapter of the book which is a quickie guide/summary is probably the best part of the book.Overall if you want a book with problems or are out of Junior High School, I dont suggest this one"
3,"Not bad, not great","This book offers a pretty good overview of the subject, and is basically well-written and easy to read, except there are numerous typos, especially in the proofs, which sometimes makes them hard to follow (and hard to trust). She also offers numerous theorems and postulates, followed by a ""Translation"" into supposed normal English, but frequently her translation is no improvement over the original. So as long as you keep your eyes open for catching her occasional mistakes, it's an OK book."
4,Simple yet Effective,This is a book written in simple terms and explanations about Geometry. It is not a deep venture into the subject but is meant to be a thought provoking tool to stimulate detuctive reasoning and apply logic to material presnted in this book. This is a starting point for the person who knows very little about Geometry but is going to delve into it.
2,Now Very Helpful,"We purchased this book along with the workbook to give my son an extra reference for his geometry class. With few examples in the book to illustrate the concept and no worked out answers in the workbook to see where you may have made a mistake, it was a waste of money for us."
4,I love my player,"I truly love my cd player. I use it in the car with a cassette adapter. The only thing I do not like is I have to adjust the volume everytime I turn off the car. I guess that is because everything is digital. My Husband has a different player. His volume is adjusted with a turn wheel, so he doesn't have this problem.I just need to read the manual and play with the different features. My player sure was a lifesaver during a 14hour train ride with noisy children behind me. Battery life is splendid. ;)"
2,Its becoming dead technology,"I rebought this because i use to own one back when they would sell these at stores but i rebought it cause it reads mp3's but at times, it will struggle to operate to play, not so sure its due to the condition or of its use, not sure but i ordered it and it works when i get it to. i guess for the price i paid for it, it was over priced for its operatable inconvienience, anyway, thats the risk you take when you order products online."
1,What a waste of money!,There were no written instructions in the box for this item. It is so lightweight that a small breeze will blow it away. The seams ripped the first time it was put up. It was a complete waste of money. DO NOT LET THE EDDIE BAUER NAME FOOL YOU!! There is no quality in this item. A trash bag and some sticks would be more sturdy!
2,A disappointment!,We bought this gazebo because we were getting ready to go to the beach and wanted to have this to put up on the beach for some shade. We got it home and put it up in the backyard so that we could see just how easy it would be and how long it would take. The gazebo was so flimsy we could hardly get it to stand up straight! We knew if there were even the slightest breeze it would fall down and we could hardly plan on taking it to use at the beach!! I plan on trying to return it and getting my money back. I thought we could trust the Eddie Bauer name!!
1,Worst media in the world.,"This media is pure crap. Don't waste your money. Appears in the begin as perfect but lost data. I evaluate this media using PI/PO tests and this item can achieve PI > 10000 after some months. This is the worst media in world. Ritek G03 was one of the best media in the world but when they introduced G04 and this G05 media the problems beginned. I buyed more than 2000 medias, with logo and without logo (printable). When I sensed that I am losting media I tested ALL medias and passed them to Sony medias (initially I thinked that was my recorder and after the armazenation method until I discovered that it was the media when I tested with DVDInfo. All G04 and G05 are crap and I tested all my media."
4,Good product for money,I am very happy with product. Good value for the money. Worked as expected. Definately no regrets about the purchase.
3,Not as good as the other Tree Hut fragarances,"Great product except for the smell. I love Ginger , but Ginger doesn't work for me in this product. Hoping Tree Hut will make Mango and Kiwi body butters again. Those smelled good enough to eat!"
5,LOVE this stuff! Smells amazing,"To begin with, almost every time any man gets within a couple of feet of me when I'm wearing that stuff he'll say ""Hey, you smell really nice"". Most men love the smell of ginger, and luckily so do I. The scent is very strong and rich, yet natural--not perfum-y. The butter itself is also very rich (that's why it's called ""butter""--it's great for rougher/drier areas like elbows, knees and feet. It's really good for the winter as the ginger has a warming action and the scent makes you think of a warm jungle, but not the best for a really hot, humid day as it may feel heavy and even cause you to sweat."
2,Not so evil,"I must admit that this costume very quickly caught my eye. I was always more a fan of Dr. Evil than of the international man of mystery. This costume was however a big disappointment. It has the quality of the pair of pants I sewed back in home economics in high school. It does look like Dr. Evil's suit, but so would and costume with that specific shade of gray. The quality isn't very great either, but you can't expect much from this price. All in all, if you're a really big fan of Dr. Evil and have to look like him, then by all means buy this. It's not a HUGE investment. However, if you like him, but don't love him, then this costume is more bad than evil."
1,Costume doesn't breath at all.,"not a quality costume by any stretch of the imagination. First the one size fits all isn't true of you're on the larger side, but more important the material doesn't breath so not wearable for any length of time."
3,Corner gas season 4,"The series is incredible. They are hilarious and a great way to pass time. However, I am having an awful time with the Dvds. Season 4 skips terribly, and I am on my second disc from the seller. The seller has sent me a second set, and it skips too. I know it is not the sellers fault, but it is really disappointing to get the season and not be able to watch all the episodes. I saw that I am not the only person with a disc that skips."
5,I love this show,"I had read about this show on the internet, but since we don't get WGN I was unable to watch. After watching a few clips online I decided to buy a season for my father - we're hooked, I ended up buying the other available seasons. One of the funniest shows around, we end up watching a few episodes on Friday night. This show isn't for everyone, but if you like shows such as Scrubs, Seinfeld, and the like you will enjoy Corner Gas."
4,Great Comedy Series,"The comedy series is great. The format of the discs is weird (canadian, I guess). some players play it, some don't and some skip a lot. Just depends on unit. My high end unit wouldn't play them properly without skipping a lot, but a cheap unit works great on them? The resolution of these is about the same as they were on TV (pretty low). Great Comedy, poor format."
5,Spanish Delta Blues,"There was much controversy, reputedly, in the flamenco world whether this stuff is 'true flamenco"" rather than guitar fantasias based thereon. By now, I don't think this matters.This music has the brooding darkness of John Lee Hooker, the string-snapping of Charley Patton, the dignity of Son House -- and at times the propulsive beat of the Stones playing ""Street Fightin' Man"" at Madison Square Garden. And in ""Levantes,"" the album's high point, de Plata reaches nearly the sublimity of the Brahms chamber music.This was all flamenco enough for Pablo Picasso, who decorated de Plata's guitar. I wonder what that instrument will fetch at Southeby's one day."
2,Very Disappointing,I was a huge fan of Thank You For Smoking. Bought it several times for friends. This was dull and plodding.
4,A cold shower in self help!,"As a devotee of self help books, this was a natural choice for a read. But the humour and plot! A natural defuser for serious contemplation, making this the one self help - oops, sorry, self hope - book to read this year."
3,"The hype was too much, it comes across as self satire.","This self serving book is about making money for the authors. I felt suckered in but did enjoy a few laughs, if you feel like paying a buck per guffaw, then this is for you. Brother Ty does make some very valid points in regards to the preachers of self help. Common sense is something most people have and Buckley proves that conclusively here but wait for the paperback or borrow the thing..."
2,"kindergarden level, boring, save your money","I really felt as though I was suckered in, all the hype etc. I fell for it..It was a very simple book that I was very disappointed in. Boring and certainly did'nt say anything new. I probably read 4-5 books a week and usually keep them all,but this one I passed on with no regrets."
2,Becomes boring after first few chapters.,I found this book to be rather dull and repetitive after the first few chapters. The satire was very humorous at the beginning but then I found myself flipping to the last chapters.
5,I MUST TELL YOU ALL...,"I must tell you all that this book is outstanding. I read it over and over again, and whenever I read it, I think of Howard Stern and Bababooey! I love it!"
4,funny for 2 reasons,This is a quick read that will provide a good laugh at the expense of mass market con artists.I'm not sure which is funnier : this book - or those reviewers below who feel cheated because they took the title seriously.
3,Perfect Satire,"I love Christopher Buckley so I started the book with high expectations and was not disappointed. A Wall-Street type goes to a monastery and gets a ""stock tip from God"" that saves the day. The book is really a send-up of self-help gurus but Buckley manages to poke fun at Catholics, the Papal Bureaucracy, Wall Street, self-help workshops, etc. etc. Plan to laugh a lot!"
3,Good fun,"While not quite as smart and smart-a**ed as Thank You for Smoking, God Is My Broker remains an entertaining read. The ending falls a little short of complete satisfaction, but as a whole the situations and plot twists presented are completely absurd yet somehow stangely plausible simultaneously (hey, if the ""insights"" of Anthony Robbins are good enough for Clinton, why shouldn't Deepak Chopra provide inspiration for a desperate abbot?) Buckley also has some great one-liners: ""If God didn't want us to throw stones, why'd he leave so many lying around?"" A worthwhile read, and very fast, too. Worth a whirl."
2,misleading but funny!!,"If your're buying this book as a guideline for combining Godly principles with those of money management, put it back on the shelf. The inside cover synopsis of the book is misleading in that sense. Otherwise, as a work of fiction, it is funny and entertaining"
2,"Nice Concept, But BORING !","The idea of a book written as a parody of all those ""self-help"" books out there is a great idea, but this one, in my opinion, quickly becomes boring and lacks direction. Maybe I just didn't get it, but it was really pointless. Save your money and pass on this one."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"A clever satire of self-help pop-culture, perhaps... But if you pick up this book thinking it's really about a monk who gets stock tips from God, then get ready to feel like a sucker! Shortly into the book, you'll realize you're being scammed, and you will feel full-on humiliation by the time you reach Law #7.5. The point is, if you like Buckley, you may like this; but if you accidentally pick it up thinking it's really a guide to combined financial and spiritual success, you're in for a rude awakening!"
1,Not what I expected,I originally thought I was buying a book to help me with buying stocks God's way. I didn't want a get rich quick scheme but a book to read that would help me with my religious stock picks. 'What I got was a book that I did not enjoy reading. I stuck it out hoping he would get to the point and tell me something I could use.....it didn't come. His 7th point is to buy as many of his books as you can and send them to your friends and that the only way to acheive wealth is to write a book! I was not impressed and would not recommend this book at all.
5,So Funny It Should Carry an FDA Warning on the Side!,"This book is a pure delight. Whether the subject is Wall Street philosophies, ""mission"" statements for religious orders, fradulent e-commerce, self-help, the Vatican hierarchy, or degrees of celibacy, Brother Ty skewers magnificiently. The unfortunate consequenses of a poor Catholic education have never been put to such a redeeming use. I laughed out loud so hard when reading this book that my children started worrying about me."
3,No longer funny when you know it's fake.,"There IS NO Brother Ty, this book is a work of fiction. I found it at an outlet store, misfiled in the ""religion"" section, and bought it for about [$], which is about what it's worth. First off, the book was funny as long as I thought it was a real account about real people in real circumstances. I find monastic life intriguing and I love reading about the day to day existence of monks. However, once, I realized it was just a novel, my interest waned immensely, and the book really lost it's ""bite."" I realize that if I had approached it as a work of fiction I would not have been so disappointed. However, if I had found the book in the fiction section of the bookstore, where it belongs, I never would have bought it. The writing is good, but it loses so much punch when you discover (after about 30 pages) that it's fiction. Now, if we could only get a story about a monastery that was this entertaining..."
2,many errors in there,"Gallenkamp did a good job in bibliographic research, but please be careful when you read this book. Don't believe everything therein is true. I have noticed that there is a tremendous amount of inaccurate information included in text especially in accounts of Andrews' whaling trip to Japan (I am a native Japanese, so I know more about Japanese geography than him!) although most of the errors do not affect significantly the whole story of Andrews' life with a full of adventure."
1,Dragon breath!,Worst writer of the century. Gallenkamp turned a fascinating subject into a bore. Read about Roy Andrews in another book written by a real writer. I couldn't wait toi finish this book so I could start a good one.
2,"Nice glass and look, the rest is shoddy.","On the wall, this is a nice-looking sconce.The method for attaching the glass to the body is absurd and terribly awkward. Seems like an afterthought or something else changed along the way without considering the resulting mess.The parts included were a hodgepodge of either redundant or unneeded bits, while others were missing.No provision for using a CFL in place of an incandescent lamp; it just won't fit. The socket should be placed lower."
1,Too much.,"Here is a perfect example of how more is not always better. The pictures are very good and because many of them are aged they are most interesting, however, someome forgot that this was also to be a wall calendar. If you are more than three feet away from the calendar you can not begin to read the dates. Excellent pictures - bad calendar, the combination makes a very mediorce product."
1,Did not get the item,You never shipped it to me. Apparently it got damaged and could not be replaced.I don't understand why you want me to review something yu did not ship.
5,LOVE IT!,"I use it for everything, from popcorn to cooking. I like that it doesn't make the popcorn wet like other sprays when you spray it on, and it has a variety of flavors that help on the popcorn too. I agree that the hot pepper one makes everyone cough, and is quite spicey. Our favorite one is the Lime."
2,The Pride of Jesse Hallam,"This item was listed as new; however it is obviously a copy. The quality was not what I expected. This is my first time to purchase from Amazon, so I was a little disappointed."
5,You must buy this screen protector,"About several months ago I purchase a PDA Survival Kit by Brain Wash/ Concept Kitchen for my palmIIxe. Needless to say, I was so disappointed and I'm a very easy person to please. Until I purchase the PDS screen prtector. What a difference! When I put the Brain wash/screen protector on my palmIIIxe the sreen seemed blurry and writting on it was awful. I thought all screen protectors was like that, so I didn't bother with finding another one until I ran out and needed more. Then I decided to try another brand, so I purchase the PDA screen protector. When I put it on my Palm it seemed as though I didn't have any thing on it at all.Wow! And when it's time to write on it, Wow, what can I say, your sylus glides across because it is so smoothes and makes writting so much better. Please purchase this product you what be disappointed."
3,Good toy,My birds love to tear these up . That's how you know they love them. I'll be ordering them again. Super Bird has some great toys.
1,Low Glow polish.,It is very low glow. Has to be on alone. Won't make polish underneath it glow. Don't waste your money.
3,"Bad for nails, but glows","After two or three coats, this polish is very glow-in the dark. The ingredients are very harsh though, so use a base coat. The polish is a bit difficult to remove as well."
5,Great Motherboard,"I've used this motherboard since it came out, and no problems. Has lots of slots so it's easy to upgrade with newer stuff (except the CPU). Would recommend this to anybody!"
4,I have to get it!,"I have thousands of tapes and CDs and download dozens of mp3 files online to hear new stuff. I downloaded 3 songs from Mp3.com by this band and I find myself singing them in the shower, in the car, in my sleep. I can't wait to hear another dozen tracks by them!"
3,Snowbound up North,"If you are contemplating a trip to Florida to fight your cabin fever, grab a copy of this new murder mystery set in Key West, and you may find an unexpected look at the sunshine state. Dania Deschamps blows readers out of the water with murder, plot twists both expected and unexpected, a home town look at Key West, forbidden love, Catholic guilt trips, the supernatural and some of the grittiest descriptions of down and dirtys I have ever tried to read. Fasten your seat belts! You are in for a bumpy ride. I read it in two sittings. I look forward to the next installment from Dania, but I think she should put a warning on the cover for the faint of heart!"
5,Thriller to the end!,"""Thirst"", on the surface appears to be a rather graphic thriller about the inner workings of a psychopathic serial killer, but getting past that, you also see that the author vividly, with words and many real-place illustrations, describes the Florida Keys where the story plays out and portrays several personal relationships which become important to the reader. I definitely think people who enjoy mystery/thrillers should read this book. FYI, you will just think you are Sherlock Holmes."
5,Just An Illusion?,"An intelligent, raw and sexy, can't-put-it-down suspense novel by a first time author who infuses her true-to-life characters with just enough questionable and quirky personality traits to seduce you into their hot and steamy world of good and evil, where reality might be just an illusion! Looking forward to another book from this promising author."
4,Camoflague Hat,Hat fits well and keeps me warm in mild winters.Fits runs on the large size so suggest getting one size smaller
3,House in Da' House,"This show has started to wear on me, very formulaic, very predictable and has started to get a little soap-opera-y (Is that a word? I guess since I started collecting this I will finish but I think that ""House"" has jumped the shark."
5,Love House,"It House, Its Great, I love itBuy it, if you are a house fan too.This was the strangest season yet of House."
3,a clip?,"'Get Happy' - House musical performed by Hugh Laurie and Lisa Edelstein [HD]a clip? is only for real fans , not so good , not so bad."
2,Faulty discs,"I love House. However, after we got into this season, one of the discs doesn't work properly at all. One episode will not play at all, the next one plays 3/4 of the way through then stops and then won't continue. Frustrated, we haven't continued to watch any more. There is no visable damage, so I am not sure what happened.When I contacted Amazon about this they said because it was after the 30day return policy than there was nothing they could do. I am really annoyed."
2,What is happening to the packaging???,"The issue here isn't the series, for those of us who truly enjoy HOUSE, will continue to enjoy the series, and at the time of this review the last season is in and another chapter in TV history has been written.My concerns are that the packaging, told to me by the supplier was ordered by AMAZON, is in ""bubble"" envelopes, and not boxes. I am still trying to figure out why this would be done. I received my copy in ""scunched up"" condition which made the product look like an accordion. I am fortunate as my disks worked, yet am wondering why the ""quality control"" folks wouldn't have realized that mailings in this manner are prone to damage.Very surprised and disappointed, AMAZON...I came to expect much more from you. Perhaps this is simply an anomaly that the good folks there will rectify very soon...I surely hope so."
4,House,"Great Season, not the best but still a great season. The more I watch it the better it gets. Highly recommend."
2,Self Destruction,"A case can be made that over the arc of the show we have been watching a self destructive character completing his goal. In the early seasons, however, House and his writers still maintained a sort of backward humanity you couldn't help but enjoy and admire.If their point was that a person can not be entirely self absorbed and long survive, they've made that point. But, in doing so, they have also taken away any sense of entertainment left in the series.While we began with a Sherlock Holmes sort of brilliance in solving medical mysteries, we have been left with almost no mysteries to solve, and the show has become concerned with the various sex lives of its characters. It has lost its penetrating moral dilemmas and become a portrait of a ruined man. Like the performance artist in the finale, it is self absorbed and almost entirely devoid of actual art."
5,House in the building!,"If you like House, then this series will be no exception. If nothing else, he keeps us entertained even in his worst moments."
3,Needs work,I doubt it's the sellers fought but the whole case was smashed up and when I opened it it was everywhere so kinda disappointing but hey what can you do
5,Gets Better Every Season,Such an amazing show. I've seen every episode and this season doesn't disappoint. So sad it's come to an end.
1,One bad disk,"The first 3 disks played fine (5 disks in the season). Disk 4 freezes at a particular spot. I tried two different players and found the same freeze location on both players.Talked to Amazon customer service. It was a horrible experience:-Could hear 2 or 3 other nearby conversations.-Agent did not speak clearly.-Had two or three 5-minute waits, on hold- At first she agreed to replace the item.-Then she said the 1-month return period had expired.-I explained that we do not watch a whole season in one month, and had just gotten to the bad disk.-She then offered me a $7.00 credit for the bad disk. I asked where I could buy a disk 4 for $7.00 (or at any price).-All she knew was that Amazon doesn't sell disk 4.I will buy my DVDs at Best Buy in the future."
5,great series,I needed to see this final episode - great storyline - great characters...well done. . . . . . . .
3,So-So,"All I'm going to say (you can read all of the other reviews) is that I think it's time to put an end to the series. They're running out of story lines, Lisa Edelstein is leaving the show, and the show really isn't all that great anymore. On the other hand, I've been a fan from day one of this show and will continue to watch it all the way to the end. I will also continue purchasing the DVD's until the end. But, I do believe that it's time to end it......"
3,A pretty good season,"I am a big house fan, but I think the show is heading in the wrong direction. The earlier seasons were clever, intelligent and kept you guessing. This season you could work things out before they happened. I felt the love arc was poorly handled and I don't believe Cuddy would have acted that way. It wasn't like she didn't know what she was getting into. I felt the final episode was a bit silly. House is reckless, but he isn't stupid. Everything he does is a calculated gamble and I don't know if its because the show has new writers or what has changed, but I was left wanting more. Still it is a great show. I think the high standards of the earlier series is what I am after. I will happily watch season eight, but I think they could have done so much more with season seven. I think the character development of house's team was really good. Some of the cases were brilliant. There were one or two rather weird and wonderful episodes. Overall it was a pretty good season!"
1,Bad purchase,Bought this season of house for my mother for her birthday received it fast but it has two of the same discs BS not happy waste of money.
4,Great season of house!!,Very good season of house funny and it keeps you hooked so youWill keep watching. Hate the way last episode ends and wish season 8 was available. Amazon shipped super fast just in time to wrap it and stick under the tree. If you like house or comedy or just like to see a good show house is right for you.
3,I have Faith!!!!!!,"I'm a big fan since day one, but right now I'm very dissapointed. That final episode.... HELLOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! This show is going in the wrong direction. This season was boring and laking in intensity. Don't get me wrong, some of the episodes were pretty good but.... I don't know what is going on in season 8 and I'm not want to imaging (""House The Sociopath"") but I think that the writers and producers can not save this show. Cuddy is out and Wilson's character was very weak in this season. I think they are essential for this show. BUT, because I'm a fan, I will end buying season 8 anyway (if is less than $20.00) because, I HAVE FAITH! but also realistic. Season 8 should be the last season. This ACTORS deserve BETTER. They are very talented!"
1,"The ""lost"" House, season7?","Where is the House we know and love? He is meaner and way out of control. He no longer has any redeeming ""virtues"". I have all the previous House DVDs but I will never order this season. Very disappointed in this season."
2,Once my favorite.,"Please get House back on Vicodin and end this House -Cuddy soap opera. The writers are surely opiate addicts because when House was eating Vicodin all day the show was great. House and Cuddy flirting with the idea of hooking up was ok, but a real relationship??? Please stop ruining my once favorite TV show."
5,Another incredible season from Hugh Laurie,"I have been a huge fan of this man and watched his Fry and Laurie series, among other offering he made in Britain and this is a perfect addition to my Laurie/House dvd collection."
4,Good Product,Packaging was slightly old and worn by otherwise it was good. I bought it as a present so I'm satisfied as far as I'm concerned.
5,from happiness to crazy,"I liked the seventh season, going from happiness to crazy. Mostly because of Hugh Lauries acting, he is really good and so rich in expressions. Good thing also the coming back of Thirteen. She is an interesting personage, more mysterious and cynical than the others - a very valuable feminin counterpart of House!"
1,"Season 7, Huge disappointment for fans.","This show has lost all its class. In the first six seasons, everything clicks together because the character's actions are driven by their personalities. Even the most outlandish of stunts seem plausible because no character ever strays from their core values. However, in season 7, House is showing its seams. The universe of House completely unravels in the second half of the season as House's character is reduced to the basest, most ridiculous plot ploys. Fans suffered every week as they watched their favorite characters, especially House, reduced to shallow, hypocritical parodies of themselves.If House can survive for a half-way decent ending (since any chance of redemption was thoroughly murdered, let's say, like a car driving through a dining room) the writers are going to have to do something drastic - ie, returning to the shows roots and not being so [insert expletive here].Now that would be a real shocker."
1,Overly complex and just plain boring.,"A definite miss for the series, we have all the hallmarks of a bad episode: an overly complex and non-relatable patient, an implausible plot, and an ""artistic"" sub theme that borders on the annoying. You could extirpate this episode from the series and it wouldn't make a difference."
3,Package quite damaged,"I received House Season 7 and could tell before even taking the plastic wrap off the boxed set that I would be lucky if all of the DVD's inside were in tact. The DVD's were sent in the standard House/TV Series box set which was expected, however, the packaging used to ship the product was basically a media mail envelope with a thin layer of bubble wrap. The entire casing for the DVD's was cracked in many places and there were little chunks of plastic rattling around inside - certainly not something you want to hear when unrapping a DVD boxed set.Fortunately it appears all of the DVD's are in tact and working well."
4,Not The Best House,"I love House, but this was not one of the best. It was actually kind of boring to me. There wasn't the thrill of a normal episode, and everyone seems to be getting soft. I hope to see better as the season plays out."
5,House Season Seven,Same as I have said before on any of the House Series. I LOVE THEM. Would highly recommend any of the House series to anyone as I can watch over and over and over again.
4,Still good for House lovers but the decline starts,"I own House, Seasons 1-7 and have enjoyed watching every show. This season was probably the most disappointing because we finally get to see House at his happiest, and then at his darkest. I was hoping for more happiness for the character but the writers/character probably didn't want him to change to be a more happy fellow! I still recommend this show, but in the past after finishing a season I have immediately ordered the next one. Not this time...I've seen some of the next season on tv and wasn't impressed. I'm sure I'll get it eventually but this time I'm taking a break!"
5,PERFECT PORTER,"It will be a remarkable feat indeed if this recording of Porter standards is ever surpassed. Feyer, a classically trained pianist, has a remarkably deft touch and an uncanny knack for the driving, rhythmic vitality of Porter's music. Acoustic guitar, drums, and other percussive instruments provide an essential, but unobtrusive, rhythmic foundation throughout. Thirty-four pieces are packed onto the disc, one often merging skillfully into the next, to form a series of three colossal medleys. Although recorded in the pre-digital era, the sound quality of this Vanguard Classics disc equals or surpasses the best contemporary recordings. If you like Porter, this one's a sure bet; if you think you don't like Porter, this one will surely change your mind."
1,Worthless Crap,"This and nearly every other sci-fi channel movie is garbage. Poor acting, terrible production values and the cheapest, poorest quality special effects. I would rather have root canal surgery than watch any sci-fi channel movie."
2,"Considering the cast of some pretty decent actors, this was so bad","Wow, talk about ""over acting"", this is a great example for want-to-be actors to watch to see ""What Not To Do."" The actors do every movement so big - pull their guns out to make sure you know they have guns, count to 3 before breaking down the door...the nurse scene after character was shot was a joke!I guess if you are into a retro, ""over-the-top,"" sci-fi movie where the blood and guts make you laugh as opposed to make you hide your eyes, this may be the movie for you. My 10-year-old son loved it! And I will confess that I did jump during one scene. Guess it's all in the eye of the beholder."
3,Initially OK,"While I was happy with the item when I first received it, I began to have problems with one channel cutting in and out. Too bad, because- when they were working, they worked great."
5,I love it/,I bought this for my granddaughter but I've played the game more than she has. My favorite computer game!
4,Awesome upgrades,"Super Collapse! 3 has lots of cool new additions to SCII. The Quest mode lets you explore all the games in varying order to keep it sharp and fresh. Also the new shops offer incentive for scoring big, plus neat Casino games offer challenge and fun. New animations and power ups (bombs). The 3 new modes are the biggest challenge yet, faster, crazier and more fun!"
4,A good value,"This affordable mic works as advertised. Getting the spider mount with it was a good move. The two units together were an excellent buy. I also use a mic screen, but only because I already had it. Popping Ps has not been a problem. There is one draw back, and it is not the mic's fault. Recording into an HP portable causes occasional static. I tried the mic on a desk top computer and there was no problem. So, whatever is causing the annoying static is because of what is happening in the computer, not due to a fault in the mic. I reduced the problem by putting the LOW CUT filter to maximum and not exceeding 16db on the gain. I tried three different recording programs in the HP and each one was affected (in varying degrees) by static."
2,A Nice Fairy Tale,"I don't dislike this author since this was his first book, but I had a lot of trouble with it. So many authors seem to think it advisable to jump back and forth in time, but this was way too much. If I'm not mistaken, he had actual trial dialogue before the trial actually started and then had too much superfluous info in there. Most readers are adept and understand trial procedures so I did a lot of skimming. He really had a good plot going on, but somehow it was just overdone and stretched the imagination beyond my limits. I was just surprised when looking up this book to find he has written others. Somehow I didn't think that would happen, but I may give him another try, after I read your reviews of his later books. Some of you are too generous, but I know you don't want to hurt feelings. I generally write my favorite authors directly and of course they are full of praise!!"
2,Not that great,"I had high hopes for this legal thriller. It felt to me that the genre could use some new blood.Unfortunately, this story did absolutely nothing for me. The author basically has two concurrent storylines going on at the same time and for the longest time, the two don't blend. Actually, it took forever for them to merge and by then, you can't really care about either of them.The writing style was ok, but that's about the best I can say about this one. It was boring."
3,Repetitive Instrumentals,"I enjoy this album because of its electro and bass feel. Songs like: ""Are You the One"", ""Down Down Down"", and ""Girl and the Sea"" can easily get u to the dance floor. While songs like ""Kitty in the Middle"" and Bad up Your Betterness"" gives you that extra sexual boost with its bass foundation. This album also has a few instrumentals like ""Worms,"" ""Black Background,"" and ""Beams"" that have no change to its intrumental pattern (no breakdown no nothing). The song ""I GO Hard, I Go Home,"" has a Kapoera sound that destroys the whole vibe of the album. It should have been a hidden track or something. In Conclusion, Purchase the following MP3's:Are You the OneDown Down DownGirl and the SeaKitty in the MiddleGirl You Chew my Mind UpBad up your Betternessand buy the CD if you really want to feel my review first hand."
4,An amazing debut album!,"The Presets have released two great EPs already, and they have completed the trifecta by releasing a great debut album. The songs cover a whole different spectrum of emotions, from dark, raw grit on such tracks as 'Are You The One?' and 'Down Down Down', to light, chilled-out tunes like 'Girl And The Sea' and 'Kitty In The Middle'. Electro has never been so cool!These guys make music that appeals to both ravers and indie lovers, by utilising dancey synth loops, deep bass, vox fade-laced vocals and generally dirty beats. These guys are touted as being a major hope as a future music leader in Australia, and it's not hard to see why. They break so many musical barriers that it is impossible to lump them into one genre. But when music is this good, genres are irrelevant. Check it out now!"
4,I DON'T MIND the new approach at all!!,"After delays and delays...I pre-ordered my copy of VANITY and finally got my hands on the long awaited album from 18 visions. Now you ask, how hardcore can an album be thats covered with a pink and blue design??? Besides 18 Vision's feminine lifestyle and Scott Weiland dancing impersonations, there a very talented band. Fans of Until The Ink Runs Out are in for a very big surprise. Vanity mixes it up a little bit, from old school 18 Visions to a softer more Get Up Kids/Incubus approach. It still has the hardcore aspect of 18 Visions but might lack getting the attention of old fans. "" Fashion Show"", ""One Hell of a Prize Fighter', and "" You Broke Like Glass"" are for the ""hardcore"" fans while ""Vanity"", "" I Don't Mind"", and "" Love In Autumn"" are for the more open minded ""hardcore"" fans. All in all VANITY is something every hardcore fan or not should check out, they also have the best hair in Rock n Roll, what more could you want?"
4,I hate purists,"Alot of people give this album a bad reveiw or make fun of the band for not playing the same crap over and over. Unlike purists, I like musical progression. This is a good album but it has its flaws."
3,ehhh,"Vanity is not a terrible album in my view but it was a stepping stone torwards 18v completely loosing their minds. Compared to albums like the best of and ""Until the ink runs out""(their best work in my view) vanity doesnt compare. Fashion Show is the stand out track on here to me since its one of the only songs that reflects their old style. If you are a huge 18v fan pick it up but i suggest their earlier stuff."
2,"Looks hot, cooks hotter!","I loved the look of this crock pot. When I opened it, though, I saw that the stoneware insert is a different color red than the pot. The pot is blazing red and the stoneware is sort of mauve-ish. That's not as important as the function, however.OK, I turned it on high to get started, and it absolutely BOILED. I turned it down to low and it STILL BOILED!! I will never be able to go away for the day and leave it cooking, and that was the purpose of having a crock pot.I am disappointed, I must say. I have never had a crock pot and I thought Rival, being the original, would be the best. Perhaps the others are better."
1,I wish I could give a zero rating,"I love cooking with my crockpot. I bought this one last Christmas to replace my old one. BIG MISTAKE. The first problem is, like a previous review stated, it cooks too hot too fast. You can't put a meal in it in the morning and leave it there until the evening or it will be burned to a crisp. I never use the high setting either because it's too hot. Second, the ceramic insert had a flaw that caused it to leak. Every time I cooked with it, I ended up having to scrape incinerated food out of the metal base afterward. Third, the plastic handles (on the top and side) all broke. This thing isn't even a year old yet and it's completely useless. My advice is spend a little extra money and get something nicer. If you don't you're just going to have to replace it soon."
4,perfect size and price.,"We bought 6 qt programmable one , it looked awsome, but was huge on the counter, and for us, so I bought this from walmart for 14$ with carrier , I enjoyed using it, make enough food for 2 people for 2 days or more. cooked everything on high for 4h and it was done. my intake on it is that when it reach a boiling points it spells, so don't fill it to the edge. also I wish this size comes programmable. cleaning was easy, easy to carry."
4,I love it!,"I haven't had any problems with mine cooking too hot like the other reviewers. It works normally and I have cooked some very tender meat in it. I just wish it came with a carrying case. I also wish they made this size in the programmable version, the SmartPot."
1,Too Hot - get a different small slow cooker,"Recently ordered this 4 qt crock pot since our larger one was too big for us now. I have loved crock pots for 30+years so I was sticking with the brand I knew and trusted. MISTAKE! When I noticed that the first small one I bought did not have a 'warm' button I returned it and ordered this one. It is always TOO HOT on the OUTSIDE of the cooker if it is on at all. I am so surprised that Crock Pot sells this. Where is their quality control? Even on 'medium' you can burn yourself if you touch the outside of this cooker. My advice is ""find a different brand"" for this size. I will for sure!"
1,very slow or no show,"I ordered set of peper and salt dec 06, I got peper mill 3 weeks ago, today a email that salt mill won't be sent until end of may. These where a CHRISTMAS GIFT."
1,Delivery will take almost 10 months!!!!!,I ordered both the pepper mill and the salt mill in January 2007. I received the pepper mill in March. I just got yet another notice from Amazon saying that I won't get my salt mill until OCTOBER!!!!! This is absolutly ridiculous! I'm very disappointed.
3,confused,It is beautifully made but when I got it my salt mill according to thr literature is supposed to be a pepper mill and it says not to be used for salt at all - very confusing. Also the light does not work anymore because SALT corroded the contacts. Crappy design.
2,Beware,"This unit arrived and, as the previous reviewer indicated, the manual indicates it is a pepper mill. However, the housing has an S monogram for salt.This has a lifetime guarantee but there is no phone or address for the company at all.It turns out that this is a company in China with no connection or origin at all to France!"
2,Mediocre,"Very little grind adjustment. It completely failed after about a year. Since then I have discovered that Cook's Illustrated won't suggest any electric mill. Perhaps as us ""Baby Boomers"" get older and develop arthritis someone will build a really good electric pepper grinder."
1,Broke after two weeks of light use,"This thing broke after two weeks of light use. There are just two of us using it, and we don't cook a great deal or eat a lot of salt, but it gave out after two weeks. Worked great at first, but then died. The light still works, a convenient feature so you can see what you're grinding, but no grind, and now it's too late to return. Grrrrr."
1,MIU salt grinder not as good as the peppermill,"A few years ago I ordered the Pepper Mill and was very pleased with it and still use it daily. Have ordered the matching salt mill 3 times. The first 2 times it was delivered incomplete, Amazon wisely removed it from the site. Now newley available I re- ordered it hoping the problem was rectified...WRONG. It may seem petty but the thing should have a cover for the bottom so that when you are finished using it and set it on a counter it shouldn't leak salt on the counter's surface. The peppermill has a bottom cover but out of three salt mills none of them have the bottom cover. Salt is highly corrosive and commom sense says that a cover is neccessary. Where is it? I didn't return it. Why bother? But don't use it either."
2,Slow and Rather Boring,"Cuba Gooding Jr, a Border Patrol Guard, is blackmailed by gangsters from his past who threaten his family if he doesn't help them smuggle drugs into the country.Not much dialog. Plenty of musical scores that sound alike. Lots of guns, shooting and blood, with the hero hunting down the gangsters at the end. Typical storyline. Predictable ending. Cuba Gooding is not seen at his best. Were it not for him this movie would receive no stars."
2,Linewatch by Brandon M. Moskos,"I just saw this movie. I actually had to rewind this movie a couple times because I found myself falling asleep! This movie can get extremely boring. It is about cuba gooding who is a border patrolman. He runs into old gang members from los angeles, who force him to help them smuggle drugs. Cuba is probably the only thing actually pretty good in the movie. The dialogue really is bad and there are too many scenes where there is a bunch of music and no one talks??? I did like the scenes of the desert though. I bought this movie really cheap, but I recommend renting it, because I don't think I would ever watch it again."
1,Cuba Gooding Jr is a good actor but...,"You won't have the chance to see his talent in this movie,really boring movie. I can't believe someone would buy this DVD, a real waste of time and money."
3,Peter Parots the Velvet Underground,"These songs were demos recorded by Peter Parrett's pre-""Only Ones"" band, ""England's Glory"", and not released until after the Only Ones' success turned Parrett into a cult star and created a market for his earliest recordings. The band also features Harry Kakouli, who later became the bass player for Squeeze. The sound is a blatant rip off of Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, so much so that I'd bet if you played this for a Velvets fan and told him these were newly-discovered lost Velvets recordings, he'd never suspect that it's really a different group altogether. The liner notes go to great lengths to say that in fact, Parrett was more influenced at the time by Dylan than Reed, but listening to this makes that claim hard to believe. Anyway, regardless of how deliberate the Velvets homage is, this is still pretty good music, and anyone who likes both the Only Ones and Lou Reed will probably like this."
4,Bright Horns,"Wonderful interplay between saxophonist, Ohad Talmor and trumpeter, Russ Johnson. The style is embued with an avant sensibility that is very listenable. The character of the compositions are bright and clear with the production lending to a sense of space."
2,aerobic instructor,the belt was missing from the combo but ordered for a class and did not check it so when i opened it found no belt just barbells
4,Money well spent,"I just love this video! It's split in 3 sections: Upper body, Lower body & Abs. Each work out can be performed independantly of the others. Each section has a warm up & cool down. Each section is approx 15 mins! Love the ab routine. The only thing is that you need the Fanny Lifter (The Firm's 3 in 1 Step) to do it right. It just sculpting. Very little cardio. I think it's great."
4,Great Introduction,"When people ask who my favorite author is, Wallace Stegner is invariably one of the four or five names I toss out. And often I get the same response... ""I've never read any Stegner"" or even ""I don't know the name"". Stegner seems to be one of American literatures best kept secrets.These stories are an excellent introduction to Stegner, his style, and his ability to write vividly about life. A number of the stories in this collection were eventually incorporated as chapters in three of his novels: ""The Big Rock Candy Mountain"", ""Recapitulation"", and ""Wolf Wilow""."
4,"Fabio, adress Mjr. Alceu Teixeira Pinto 45 cep 84050.450",I'd like to buy CDs: Ecos from Paris Ecos from Hollyood Ecos from Latino America and others..
5,Sublime,Glorious....a blast from the past...one of my favorites to read again and again. This book takes me back...and takes the reader through a haunting journney of love and memories.
3,"good, but they've done better.","This is a pretty solid album, but I times I find it to be rather monotonous and repetitive. Songs like Reaction and The Final Goodbye are really good at setting the mood of the album, and give it a pretty dark theme. This is packed with a lot of speedy blasts of crust influenced hardcore. Overall though, I would recommend their discography or the split with Victims over this."
2,Poorly written book,"This book is just not good. It is jumps around a lot from a novice perspective, and is often either confusing or just not well explained. I would not recommend this book for any neophyte investor, like myself."
1,Trouble,"From the bizarre early sequence lifted almost verbatim from Hemmingway's ""Big Two-Hearted River"" (an homage? A joke? either way I don't get it) to the rambling, depressing, Connie Willis-meets-cyberpunk conclusion, ""Mind Catcher"" is a work in search of a point.It is an odd take on the mad scientist/doctor genre, I'll give it that, but the premise at the heart of the book--a PET-type scanner that can suck your soul out through your eyes (seriously!)--is ludicrous to be beyond the possibilty of suspension of disbelief.This really epitomises a bad techno-horror-thriller. The ideas are utterly unoriginal and the plot telegraphes its moves half a book ahead. It was really only morbid curiosity and insomnia which got me to the end. In case you're curious, they all live happily ever after.Yuck."
1,Far-fetched piffle in the hands of a hack,"A skilled writer might be able to engage an audience with a premise as far-fetched as transferring human personalities into computers. Unfortunately, John Darnton hasn't done this. The writing is hardly inspiring, and the plot wanders needlessly. This plodding pot-boiler may be accurate in its presentation of brain physiology. I can't say, since I'm not a physician. But I am a photographer, and the section in which one of the protagonists shoots photos on 4x5 roll film raises doubt regarding the technical knowledge of the author and his editors. The point here is that, as far as I know, 4x5 roll film is not available, at least to the casual photographer. When faced with such bloopers, I always wonder why authors feel they should blunder around in areas where they are obviously uninformed, and why editors don't double check this sort of thng."
2,Not Recommended,"This book started out with a great premise. The first few pages had me hooked - or so I thought. About 50 pages in I started getting bored. Soon I was skimming multiple pages at a time. The author obviously did extensive research for this novel and, sadly, decided to put every bit of it into the story. I found the constant intricate medical talk distracting. The amount of information was unnecessary and took me out of the story. Also, the characters had a tendency to go through two or three pages of introspection - over and over - to the point where the story lost its zing.This book could easily have been 100 pages shorter without losing anything. In fact, a shorter version would have gained intensity (for me, anyway)."
2,Not About Real Science or Medicine,"This book is a paranormal thriller decorated with interesting ideas from recent research. But the book doesn't address any real issues raised by those ideas. The style of the book is that events unfold, and one is told what to believe and feel about them by what the sympathetic characters believe and feel, even when this makes no sense in terms of the events themselves, as happens most jarringly with the central hinge event, where everyone goes berserk over a pacemaker turning on.Ironically, the point the book makes best is that doctors should be honest with their clients, and not gloss over the difficult parts. I liked how the melodramatic, but all-too-plausible villians were put through some changes."
1,Yawn,"This book just rambles and rambles and doesn't even get interesting until the last 100 pages or so.It's a great premise, but pooly done.Darnton also seems to like to talk about male genitals -- 3 times (and it always is ""off to one side"") man, how does this apply to the story?Big yawn, move on."
2,Definetly Not Robin Cook or Michael Palmer or even Clement,"John Darnton starts off well, pulls you in as a man who has already lost his beloved wife now is very close to losing his only child. The father takes his son, who fell off a cliff and has a piece of climbing equipment embedded in his forehead, to the best neurosurgeon for care. This neurosurgeon has a ""God Complex"", imagine that in a neurosurgeon, and he also has a co- conspirator who is both mad scientist and computer genuis/geek who is conducting experiments on how the mind travels outside the body into another existence. From there ""Mind Catcher"" becomes a mad-scientist science fiction nonthriller with a blunted ending that is less than satisfing. My recommendation: Skip this one and look for something by Robin Cook, Michael Palmer or Peter Clement that you haven't read yet."
3,NOT a replacement for the LP I was seeking,"I have tried for years to replace the Vanguard LP (SRV 363 SD) of Stokowski conducting A Baroque Concert. This CD, like all other replacements, has Mozart's ""Serenade No. 10 for 13 Wind Instruments,"" instead of the gorgeous ""Shepherd's Christmas Music"" (Sinfonia from ""The Christmas Oratorio"") by J.S. Bach. Ah well, back to the drawing board. I could have sworn the item was described as the same recording, but alas, I was disappointed.However, the vendor service was rapid, an exchange of emails before delivery was cordial, and the item was safely packaged for shipment. I would highly recommend the vendor, if you are absolutely certain that the item you are ordering is identical to your expectations."
1,WRONG DVD TWICE,I ordered this twice and was sent Sharon Lois & Bram Make Believe from The Elephant Show BOTH Times. Do not make the same mistake I did order this great DVD that I remember on VHS as a kid from Casabalanca KIds website.
2,not if you have a wireless computer connection!,"I bought this monitor thinking that it has more range and more ghz so it must be better- not. It is in constant interference with our wireless connections for our computers and with our wireless telephones, which are also on the same frequency. Like babyfriendly suggested if this is for indoor use, get another monitor because ours was constantly clicking and static. *Sigh* wish I would have known this before I spend my $50."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Although I'm happy with the range this monitor gets, the clarity is so awful you can't hear your baby crying even if the monitor is a few feet away from the sound. I'm highly dissapointed and can't believe Fischer Price could even sell a product with quality this poor."
2,not good!,"Used this monitor for about a week, very dissapointed. It has a lot of static, can hardly hear baby. It may work good for a little while, and then if you use microwave or cell phone it has a lot of static. Couldn't use for out 2 level house."
1,ALL interference!,"I bought this thinking that it certainly had to be worth the $50. It's sadly not.I think it worked for about a night, after that it was a nearly constant clicking of interference that sounded like somebody was slapping the receiver in the baby's room and it 1) Woke us up in the middle of the night and 2) Was so loud, we couldn't hear the baby!After trying every suggestion (plug it into a different outlet, move both receivers to different locations in the rooms, etc etc etc.) we threw our $50 into the trash! That could have bought a lot of diapers!"
2,What a Mistake!,I too thought that with 2.4GHz this would be a great monitor - WRONG! I cannot believe how much static you hear on the lowest volume! I thought maybe all monitors sounded like this until I started reading reviews. Do not waste your money!
1,Do not buy,"This is the worst monitor! I have the Fisher Price 900 for my first child and bought this thinking it would be just as good. It claims there will be less interference, but this is not true. EVERYTHING interferes with it. We bought a new telephone thinking that would help, but the wireless router interferes with it as well as the microwave and both of our cell phones. I wish I would have known before and I would not have bought this monitor."
5,Great product!,This monitor worked great for my first child and now I am using it for my second. We haven't had any problems at all (but then again we don't have wireless internet.)
1,Pure JUNK!,"I am not typically compelled to write reviews, but this monitor is such a piece of junk I felt I should write in an effort to prevent others from making the same mistake by purchasing this. The interference is absolutely terrible. We couldn't hear the baby even when she was nearly screaming. FP should take this off the market."
1,Terrible Monitor,"Just plugged it in for the first time, and it clicks unless the user is about 15 feet away from the base unit. I am so frustrated that I just bought this and have to return it right away. This thing really is a total piece of junk. Avoid at all costs."
1,"""Reliable Static"" Sums It Up--Excellent CS Though","A reviewer below says this monitor provides reliable static all the time, at all volumes, on both channels. We found this to be true, as well. The FP customer service was **outstanding** though. They sent us a label to return it, along with a voucher for the retail price that can be used on any Mattel product (FP, Hot Wheels, Matchbox, Barbie, etc.). I can't say enough about the customer service...I just wish the monitor had worked."
1,"Don't be fooled by 2.4GHZ, but Fisher Price comes through","Like other reviewers have said, there is a ton of interference on this monitor that is quite disturbing at night.We registered for and recieved the 2.4GHZ monitor because it boasted further distances.At first, I thought it was a problem with the monitor, so I called Fisher Price and they sent me a new one after I sent the original in. Within a few days, I had another new monitor that did the same thing. When I called back again, I asked if I could get a different monitor that was on 900 mhz. I had borrowed a Sony 900mhz monitor that worked fine, and the CSR confirmed that it was likely the 2.4 that was finding interference with our wireless network or something else in the neighborhood. She is now sending me a refund for the monitor and a label to send it back. Kudos to Fisher Price/Mattel for great customer service! I am now going to try the Private Connections monitor instead."
3,buy a size larger,"I am a size ""medium"" in tops but this tank top was uncomfortably tight in medium. Buy a size larger than you think you need. I had washed mine already and could not return it."
3,Low Tack Adhesive,"If you enlarge the picture it shows that the product has a ""low tack"" adhesive. It just depends on whether you trust the adhesive type protector or the slide in kind. I haven't used this specific product - the rating is just to add to the information provided by the previous review."
4,Mama Mia!,"Lynne Graham does it again! The Secret Wife has conflict, passion, romance, everything Lynne Graham is known for in the romance world. Rosie, the heroine, goes up against an arrogant Greek tycoon in an attempt to make him believe a long-buried secret and, in the process, also get out of her life. Her love interest gets swept off his feet trying to foil her constant attempts to run away from him. There could only be one ending in this tug-of-war: a passion neither ever thought imaginable."
4,love the spunky heroine,i loved how spunky the heroine was in the book...i loved how the heroine talked to the hero..would recommend it if u want to read something light and funny
4,Cute heroine...,Spoiler alert!The heroine is the illegitimate daughter of the hero's surrogate father. In order to prevent her dead father's widow any more grief - by finding out about her existence - the hero marries the heroine but is intensely jealous and hung up about her relationship with his father - he thinks she was his mistress - and the heroine's childhood friend - she practically grew up as an orphan and had a pretty tough childhood including some traumatic sexual almost-experiences. The kicker of course is that the widow knew along who the heroine was~
2,Trying Too Hard,"I wish I had read other reader reviews before spending my money and time, but mostly my time on this book. The ""professional"" reviews have got it all wrong, it;s not really very good at all. I am left with the impression that the author is trying to impress us with his knowledge of Shakespeare, his cleverness over Hamlet,his understanding of psychoanalysis, his admiration for Freud/hatred of Jung and his research of old New York. Only the last of these works at all. It's what kept me motivated to finish the book though I do confess to skipping paragraphs about 60% into it. The plot, which is summed up extremely well by a number of the Amazon reviewers has great potential - initially you get really sucked in - but then in the end feel robbed. There are so many threads that don't really ever come together, the dialog in many cases is amateurish,the intertwining of Hamlet gets boring and overall the plot is forced. Basically a dissappointing read."
3,"A decent debut, but lacking","When I heard of the premise of this novel, I was very interested in it. Historical fiction is not an easy genre to conquer and I was intrigued by this particular author's take on Sigmund Freud and his American visit.One thing that Rubenfeld does particularly well is his research. Freud is portrayed exactly the way that he is when taught, as an erudite scholar. However, it seems that fiction is something that he needs to work on.Rubenfeld's descriptions of turn of the century New York City are very pleasing, however his characters are somewhat bloodless, as it is very hard to engage with some of them. Some plot twists are easy to guess and somewhat disappointing when finally borne out. It is a quick read and entertaining if you like Freud or historical fiction. Not the best, but okay."
4,"A well-written, regular whodunit","Reading that the author is a lawyer who studied Shakespeare guaranteed that I would give this book a high rating. That's one rare specie, someone who was thought not to exist (mostly by me). In the end, though, it turned out to be a regular (albeit amazingly researched) whodunit in which historical characters moved about. Despite the high marks (I'm terribly impressionable), I would say that the most interesting parts in the book don't have anything to do with finding out who did what but the moments of digression in which were discussed Hamlet and psychoanalysis. Still, it is a well-written work and I'm just happy I read it."
4,Happiness vs Meaning in life,"A good read... The most impressed words are at the very begining: Happiness means you live in present time, not past, not future. Do you choose happiness or live a meaningful life? The write says the latter."
1,A Horrible Thriller,This book is a waste of time and probably does not even warrant a sentence as a review. Don't waste your money.
4,Well written and more suspensful than I expected,"I had feared at the beginning of the book that it would be predictable as Mr. Rubenfeld is almost a bit to eager to direct you to potential suspects. However; as I read on I was pleasantly surprised with the turns in the story. I agree with a few others that the Freudian and Shakesperean themes, while necessary, were a bit too much and I would skip whole paragraphs to get past the wordiness of them. All in all though, felt this was a very good first novel and liked the mix of fiction with non-fiction."
1,This is supposed to entertain me?,"The book opens with a description -- a loving one -- of a girl being sexually tortured. I waded through that section (and others) hoping it had some point, some reason to be so graphic. But in the end -- apparently, the gruesome details were given just for the titillation of the readers.Which brings me to my point: why would anyone want to be titillated by the description of a girl being sexually tortured?Why?"
4,true crime before the genre existed,"Fascinating detective thriller with Freud, NYC, murder and taboos all wrapped together. Very enjoyable read with good writing and meticulous research. Strongly recommend for anyone wondering what the world may have lloked like before the descent into madness that started with WWI and continues to the present day. People may be sane, but collectively are insane.Medical aspects of this are also brilliant, as is the history of the period architecture of NYC. People who know the city well will especially enjoy this."
1,Pretentious old tosh,"Picked this novel up in an airport and wish I hadn't. Almost from the off the whole project reeks of ""Hi I'm Jeff. I once wrote a thesis on Freud and in this book I'm going to show you how much I know him"". The result is an overbearing work of pretension. The interwoven pieces of ""The schoolboy's interpretation of Hamlet"" only intensify the cringe. The ""thriller"" aspect is not even worth the name. A shaft of light is offered by a fine description of how to build a bridge over a river in Victorian times. Ultimately, the book bombs because the author fancies himself as a Euro-intellectual."
4,taut & well-written,"When I bought this, I didn't realize it was a prequel to a book I read previously & enjoyed immensely, The Death Instinct. As the other, this was well-paced, suspenseful, packed with brilliant pieces of real history, and deftly woven with true events."
2,Too confusing; I can't recommend it.,"I""m a psychologist and love mysteries so this seemed like a book I would love. It started out strong, but I began to lose interest as the plot and the characterization became more convoluted. The plot itself gets lost in the exposition about Freud, Jung, etc. Jung is portrayed in a very negative light that doesn't make a lot of sense. Little details about Freud seem like vanities of the author who wrote a thesis about him (the scene about his enuresis really put me off and did nothing to advance the story!). Details are supposed to make the characters more interesting, not less. By mid-book, I had completely lost interest. The tone is uneven with a few early parts being well written and the rest sounding painfully amateurish. Although I wanted to like this book, ultimately I can't recommend it."
3,Definition of guilty pleasure,"Well this book was nothing short of preposterous, I won't even go over the plot because by the end nothing made sense! However the historical facts about New York City were a extremely well done--I was particularly fascinated about the bridge building details. Unfortunately the real life character were less successfully depicted. I have not read much about the lives of Jung and Freud, but in this book they come across as creepy and unbearable, while their dialogue was just insufferable. The rest of the characters were a colorful lot particularly the brash detective, but most of them were also rather ""cartoonish"" as someone else pointed out. The mystery itself was fascinating and suspenseful but degenerated into something nonsensical and even stupid, but, hey, it kept on twisting until the end and it kept me reading (or in this case listening on CD) without wanting to stop. That in itself is something of a recommendation! A guilty pleasure if ever there was one."
2,Laughable plot,"Full marks to the author for re-creating the New York City of 1909 but it's many a long year since I have read such a laughably preposterous plot. It was what I imagine Agatha Christie would have produced if she were on acid!Poor character development, added to to the many twists and turns made this a poor read. Once put down, it was very difficult to pick the book up again."
4,Amazing Tapestry - one loose thread,"Beautifully written, extremely well researched and a complete pageturner. I couldn't put it down and loved how challenging it is and how well it creates the America vs Europe feel of 19th C NYC. I felt that it was a great historical fiction piece and had very well thought out character analysis, but I was left with questions about the murder itself that gnawed at me after I put the book down."
5,Delicious Entertainment,Filled with fun period detail and sly ironic humor this a novel with ideas. But when the action takes off you're on the edge of your seat -- with a spectacular action set piece. A marvelous hero and a delightful heroine to root for as well. Of all the historical thrillers in the wake of The Alienist this is the most fun.
4,good book on Linux 2.6 kernel programming,"There are not many good books on Linux kernel programming. This is the most recent good book. The text is informative, but there are quite a few typos. ""Linux Device Drivers"" is another good book on Linux kernel programmaing, but it focuses on the older Linux 2.4."
4,Great book,"I like the book because it is well organized, clear, no nonsense, explains the subject top-down, up-to-date including kernel 2.6, contains very little code and despite the subject still readable as a regular book. It is like a book about operating systems in general but about Linux only. I'd recommend reading this book before ""Understanding the Linux Kernel"".However, I find the word ""Development"" in the title a little misleading because the book contains very little about the actual howto and could have been backed up by for example an appendix with an example from real life with a step-by-step walk-thru by the hand."
4,Very good range but subject to falsing,"This radar detector has very good range but has a tendency to false, especially in the Ka band (it seems to be set off by a number of other brands' detectors). It's ability to pick-up photo radar is not very good, but for X- and K-bands (and laser when I've come across it), it provides adequate warning. It has a good visual display and very distinctive audio alerts, as well as a sturdy windshield mount. Can't go wrong with this one."
4,Replaced Speaker 2 times in 1 year,I had to send my 850sti to the factory (under warranty) twice in 1 year to have the speaker replaced. The turn around time was almost 7 weeks both times. Was not an easy experience. Other than that the detector works great.
5,Just What We Needed...,"The product arrived within a reasonable amount of time.My Finches love it, and sleep in it together.I look forward to expanding my indoor aviary with more of these nests.=]"
2,Expensive for what you get.,"I bought this study guide as a refresher for my re-certification, after reading it, I recommend you save your money and buy a comprehensive automotive electrical systems diagnostics book it will better prepare you for the ASE test. Good luck!"
2,don't waste your money,"Not what we expected. DON'T waste your money, or at least read it first to see if it'll help you personally. Not for people with experience."
4,Original Piece,"I was skeptical at first, but once I began and noticed how the author delivery was unique it captivated me. She actually explains her poems; I don't have to guess or come to the wrong conclusion. Some may disagree, but I like to feel and know the author's actual view not my own. I finished this book in two sittings. When I finished I was disappointed because I wanted more."
4,A review from the other side of this story.,"Unfortunately, I had to view this movie not out of wanting to see it, but as closure. The woman that was shot to death in this documentary was my aunt. I would just like to say that she was a wonderful woman and is greatly missed by all that knew her."
5,A documentary that holds true even after multiple viewings...a must see!,"I have seen this documentary over 5-6 times since it's release and the emotion I feel every time I see it is as strong and as real as the first time I watched it on television. I don't know which emotion is stronger; the anger I feel towards the police and prosecution who failed this young man, or the despair, helplessness and sorrow I feel for and towards the innocent young man who is at the center of the documentary. From almost the very first time you see him on camera in this film, I feel in my gut that he is innocent and incapable of the crime he stands accused. And you can't help to think that those who prosecute him KNOW IT ALSO but brush that aside to further their own causes and that is, in reality, the biggest crime of all. But I digress and emplore all to see it and come to your own conclusions. I promise you it will resonate with you forever."
5,Put your self in this movie!,"Absolutely riviting. Next time you think of bashing a lawyer, think about these two public defenders. Next time you profile some less fortunate human in your mind watch this movie. Nothing is as compelling as reality. This film is tightly edited and lets itself be carried by the strength of the actual participants. Documentary at it's very best along with much fascinating supplemental material."
2,Simply cannot relate to her views,"I've read the first two chapters. Personally this book doesn't cut it for me. The way she sees the chakra is completely different from what I'm used to (ie: 7 levels) and she attributes different colors to them. That in itself isn't the biggest deal, but her exercises seem to require extremely specific hand positions and such things which personally (from experience) doesn't require such complex coreography.I have no doubt that what she wrote works for her and will work for someone else our there, but to me, this book isn't what I would see as a ""good book to learn from"". It's more of ""this is my way to do it"" with a laundry list of what I can do and you can do the same thing."
4,In depth,"Read the entire book, from cover to back. She offers alot of what I would call theories or ideas; ways to look at situations! I would say that having the gift she does, the things she says are true; however, some of the book seems to have just someones perceptions of things in general. I liked what I learned, and I also have opened up a few things in my mind, and I have to say I felt something while reading this book. First book on psychics I have ever read, and I would reread a few of the chapters. Betty offers a few mental exercises to tap into your abilities which, given time, has shown me a few things I've personally never thought I would've experienced without having read the book. The approach and beliefs I personally do not find to be able to handle by everyone, but some of the things mentioned in there are provable by science. A good book, gets better in the later chapters."
4,Heavy duty bits,"Bits are very heavy duty and should last a long time. Good range of sizes, and the length is very good."
1,Not Quite Right,"Let me start by stating that every hex wrench I've bought in the last ten years has been a Bondhus, these are a failure. The small sizes:2-4mm and even the 5mm are just like little nipples on the end of a 6mm shaft, for recessed bolt heads just forget it. Without a smaller shaft to twist under torque these ""nipples"" will snap off and with such a thick shaft right to the end the angle drive doesn't work. Look elsewhere unless all your bolts are proud of the surface and have no nearby obstructions."
5,"eres fan, tienes que tener los videos","los videos son lo mejor, si no los has vistos tienes que verlos."
1,Disappointing!!!,"I purchased this series on Deadwood after having visited there last summer with my husband. I wanted to know more of the history and thought a ""story"" history would be fun. Instead, within the first few minutes of the first segment, my ears were greeted with repeated four-letter words I would be ashamed to repeat. I would also be ashamed to have this series on my DVD shelf. Shame on HBO!!! By the way, I returned the series!"
3,Concise,"This is a slim and concise guide to chart patterns and the relationships between volume and price. There is a brief discussion of moving averages and other indicators like oscillating waves, but the bulk of the book is centered on how to interpret the patterns seen when reading a stock chart.I think think the book would have been more useful for me if it included chapters about some of the other tools that are commonly available for charting stocks, such as Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)."
2,Sooooo Basic,"Beware of the description of this book. Anyone who has a scintilla of technical analysis knowledge should avoid this book. If this is your very first day of obtaining trading knowledge then this is the book for you. If it is your second day, you are already beyond this book."
3,"Good, but not great","My goal is to become a long-term investor, not a short-term trader, but I still think it's best to understand both sides of the market. This is a good resource for learning about some of the most common stock chart patterns, but it doesn't go much deeper than that. It's a useful little guide, but a starter resource at best. If I could give it three and a half stars, I would, but four stars would be a bit generous."
2,Basic as 1 2 3,"you won't get much out of this book if you have a little understanding of technical analysis. However, it may be suitable for those who have no idea what investment is."
1,"Wrong title! Should be ""Guide to Charting""","I was very disappointed to read this book (in about an hour because it is so basic) after reading all the reviews and all the people that agreed with the reviews.This book is not about technical analysis at all, but is probably the most classic book on chart reading I have ever seen. If you want to know all about head-and-shoulders, double-bottoms, and bearish flags, then this is a must read book. But, if you are looking for information on how to use the MACD, %R, RSI, MFP, etc. technical analysis indicators, then don't expect to find anything in here."
1,Disappointment,"This book did not offer any useful complex information. It is directed for those that are just getting started with the stock market. If you even know a little about technical analysis, this book would provide no extra value"
5,A fantastic primer on TA,"First my disclaimer... I am a TA believer. Not everyone is and I think that is okay, because the stock market can be approached with many valid approaches (valuation, indexing, etc). I happen to think that TA is among the best.This is a great primer on TA. I have read quite a bit of TA and am a practicing technician. This is a great way to get exposure to the concepts. This is definately not comprehensive, but the concepts are simple (which is the best way to keep TA) and worthwhile."
4,Organized presentation of basic concepts,"I would five a ""5"" if this book would have more details on more advanced subjects. But in general, a good book for most people to start with. Some reviews give this book a ""1"" or ""2"", I would say those people bought the wrong book in the first place, not the book itself.Just like everything else, you can't emphasize enough about the understanding of basic fundamental concept. You don't need to read too many books, read this book, digest the ideas, and apply what you learn. You won't regret."
2,good book nightmare of a reading!!!!!!,mr renz has to go back to a middle school and take a course in writing! My 13 year old does a much better job. It is tedious and outright boring to read. I felt like screaming fire several times;learn to come to the point man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Major Flaws For A Collector,"The major flaws are :1) No dihedral in the wing.2)The wheels on the main gear are reversed, the wheel should be on the other side of the strut.These are observations from just looking at the pictures on the box, that was enough to keep me from purchasing it. However, I have purchased the Corsair, P-38, Me-109, and Stuka and been very pleased."
2,nothing serious about this history,"Maybe not a bad book, but close. There are much better histories of Nevada and even of Reno (William Rowley's, for instance). There is a map of the original town plan, or I would have given it but one star.The authors seem to have based their research on a book they were too shy to include in their bibliography, Gilman Ostrander's ""Nevada, the Great Rotten Borough."" (Even when they take quotes from Ostrander, they get them wrong, such as Yerington's quote about horse thieves!)They have photos from Don Dondero's Dateline Reno that aren't from that book. What a mess!Nice idea to take a Look Magazine approach to Reno, but this is hollower than a gourd. UNR Press should recall it before someone gets injured reading it."
4,Good Information On Improving Sales,"5 Steps to Successful Selling by Zig Ziglar contains useful information on improving your sales performance in an easy-to-listen cd that lasts for around an hour. The cd may be easily listened to when you are driving in between sales calls.The basic organization is as follows:1. Prospecting2. Presenting3. Closing4. Follow-Up5. Positive Self-ImageWhile others may not like Ziglar's folksy image, I like his approach. He seems genuine about helping other people instead of just manipulating others to buy his products.The insights are practical and anyone may benefit from Ziglar's wisdom. I will need to check this item out again from the local library for refreshment and remembering. Good info.Recommended."
2,Brian Tracey is much better,"I purchased both this audio book and Brian Tracey's Psychology of Selling, the Art of Closing the Sale on audio book. I have never written a review on Amazon and my dissapointment was enough to motivate me to do se. First off the auther is very distracting with a voice that sounds like Mr. Roper from Threes Company. Secondly just about everything minus one or two things was available in Brian Tracey's audio book. Get Brian Tracey, it's worth the money. It has more information, longer in length, presented much better, no corny humor, and best of all, he doesn't sound like Mr. Roper. Hope this helps."
5,WOW!,"Wow, wow, wow!If you are in sales, this little cassette will save you money, time, and energy. This is a must have for all sales people.If you are a sales professional and dont have this little gem, I dont think you are serious about your sales!"
3,Sales evangelist,this CD has useful information and I still found it difficult to listen to because of the way Ziglar speaks. It sounds reminiscent of a TV evangelist.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was pleasantly suprised at the product: BLOODLINE. Before purchasing, I was aware that it was an import. The audio and video are great! Audio is stereo and video is 1.66:1 widescreen. There are even English subtitles.It was also great to have the last unavailable Audrey Hepburn film made available to all of us diehard fans."
5,:),Very Happy to have found a movie My friend doesn't have in her Audrey collection! Made a wounderful Christmas Gift!
3,Bloodline,"I thought the movie was just OK but what I,m really upset with is that it was from Korea. The DVD jacket was written inKorean and it looked as though a very cheap printer was used to transfer the image for the disc. I wish there was a way toknow before you purchase, where the hell it's coming from. I guess it could be worse, at least I can play the movie, (whichI think was cut in spots making it difficult to follow) as opposed to being stuck with a movie that is not formatted correctly.As far as the movie, it's not the best plot,choppy rushed toward the end to finish. The ending was very much like ""Charade"" with lead actor Cary Grant where Hepburn is forced to decide who she has to trust with her life. Very disappointed in the seller."
2,Does it's job......but,"Well I purchased this in March of 2008, got it quickly. Found out once I received it that it didn't screw into the lens, that it goes on the lens adapter ring that the flower lens hood connects too. So now if I wanted to protect my lens I have to put this big bulky adapter ring on, that looks goofy on the camera. Then I take a few pictures with the camera to see how they look with the lens protector on, and find out it causes a shadow on the bottoms of the pictures. However it seems to go away if I zoom the camera to at least 3x zoom."
4,Lagrimas Negras Edicion Especi,This CD is an acquired taste as not everyone will be able to get to grips with the flamenco style singing of Cigala but the piano playing of Bebo is always great to listen to.
5,Fun DVD,"If the Beatles had stayed together, I believe that they would sound like Mana does today. Mana uses simple chord patterns, yet the melodies and lyrics to the songs are so sophisticated, that Mana is years ahead of most other bands.As for Acceso Total, I really like it. It does not have the clarity of sound or photography that the MTV Unplugged DVD has, but Acceso Total is really fun, and captures the enthusiasm of audiences around the world. The concert footage is great, and this DVD also has subtitles, so that people that are not fluent in Spanish, can enjoy the meanings of the lyrics. There are also special features that give a glimpse into the band as people, and extensive interviews with Fehr and Alex. Maybe this is just for the camera, but my impression is that Mana is very down to earth, and very nice people.I believe that any fan of rock and roll would like this DVD!"
4,Lives up to it's title...,This is a fun video for any Maná fan out there. It's a great mix of backstage access with live performances. A must have for any fan. The only way it could have been better is to have an entire concert from start to finish but this will hold everyone over until the band decides to take on such a project.
4,"Awesome concert, reasonable dvd","The DVD is a registration of a series of concerts of Mana in the years 2002 and 2003. The concerts are great and there is a lot of effort put in the whole production. Unfortunately the DVD covers only ten songs and a lot of extra's we don't need. The English subtitles are simply crappy. The producers of this DVD surely embarrass the band, which put up such an amazing concert."
3,Not the most helpful book ...,"It wasn't exactly what I expected. ""Meditations"" suggested there were perhaps prayers or great insights. It's a collection of the author's personal experiences and tid-bits of her idea of what makes a good Vestry member in the Episcopal Church. It's not clear why the author thinks she's qualified to make suggestions on how to succeed on the Vestry. She apparently quit her local parish Vestry when things got too controversial. She's the Sarah Palin of the Episcopal Vestry. Quit and then write a book."
5,An amazing engineering feat,"While this account was obviously written and designed for a younger reader, I enjoyed it very much. It was so informative andtakes you through every step of the process from the design to the opening. What an amazing and marvelous project to have been conceived and built more than 120 years ago when engineers and workers did not have the equipment that would be available for such an undertaking today. The fact that the bridge has stood for all this time shows the genius of the designer and engineers, and the dedication of the workers. I recommend this book to anyone, young or old."
3,"better than styrofoam, but not completely waterproof","This product is great for people who are too busy to do dishes.It's a time saver, and is better than styrofoam (against heat).However, it is not steam proof, as I find that water vapor does manage toseep through. So if you are using it for a hot bowl of soup, youmay find some moisture at the bottom. It's not to the extent whereit leaves a puddle, more like a ring of dew. Works great with cold foods though."
5,Wish they had a 20oz bowl.,These bowls are magnificent. I use at least one every day to warm soup or heat chili. Sugar cane fiber has found its niche in the world with Stalkmarket. I use their dinner plates also and am very pleased these products are compostable.
1,LOUSY PRODUCT,"This product doesn't work. The worst part, it's hard to get off. Please take my advice; DO NOT BUY it!"
5,A major treasure in your collection!,"Such day as today but in 1892, Szigeti came to world. And this oppotunity to celebrate another additional anniversary of his birthday the ocassion is pleasant to recommend without reserves this anthological album.In the whole musical story you will never find such status level as in this collection.Verve, perfect intonation, superb nuance, passionate charm and flwless articulation are conjugated in every one of these Sonatas.The second choice, but miles away would be Artur Grumiaux, but Siget`' s scope certainly establishes a very spaced difference.If you have any doubt , please check for the artists who played with him: Bela Bartok, Artur Schnabel, Egon Petri and Pablo Casals.Doesn't it talk by itself?."
3,Mercy,"First off, this isn't your typical low-budget horror movie. MERCY's ambitious experimentation with sound, imagery, and storytelling give this expressionistic work a depth that is lacking in most films of this genre. Stunningly photographed in rich black and white, MERCY is a psychologically suffocating account of an ex-con looking to make a new start. Unfortunately for John Mercy, his dream of anonymity is plagued by disturbing flashes of his violent past and a predatory world that seems to be lying in wait."
3,Great for fans of indie thrillers,"This film was dark, brooding, and creepy. It will be appreciated most by fans of low-budget indie films, especially those with an interest in low-budget psychological thrillers. Those who equate this film with big-budget movies in the theater will be disappointed because this film is just what it proclaims to be -- a small-budget movie filmed largely with local talent. In that regard, it succeeds greatly. Of all aspects of the film, I consider the psychological elements of the plot to be the most compelling.If you go into the movie with accurate expectations, you will not be disappointed."
4,Surprising...,"Although I don't usually watch anything darker than ""Singing in the Rain"", this movie moved me. Gary Shannon's portrayal of John Mercy was so realistic that I had to remind myself he was acting. I hope we see more of him in the future."
1,Don't waste your money!,"MercyThe star of this ""movie"" is a local deejay (who I have always adored), and that is why I bought this DVD. However, after watching it, I'd suggest he keep his day job and forget about acting. This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen, and then that is an understatement. It was sheer torture to sit through this DVD. This was filmed locally, but I would also suggest the film company give it up. This is, obviously, a low-budget film and not worth the paper the cover is made of. The bottom line is save your money and your eyesight. I wish I had."
5,Awesome!,"My son wanted the game because according to him, the visuals and graphics are better than the ones for the DS game! My son really enjoys the game and plays it often over his other games."
4,PC Web slinging. That works,"This is probably one of the few obscure Spider Man titles that gets the gist of spider man's personality to a ""t"". It has its control issues, and camera problems, but it holds well when compared to its brethren. It's a fine title to have on PC, GC, PS2, and any other systems."
2,Fun for about an hour,"Okay so you start off fighting Venom and then you get to chat with Mary Jane for a while, then race the Human Torch... Then you have to do your busy work for 30 minutes before it'll take you to the next part of the story. Rescue some people, beat up some gangs, collect some tokens, run a race, get your story scene, lather rinse, repeat.The most annoying part of this game is the stupid races. Race the Human Torch, race the clock, race the Rhino, race Electro. They should have just renamed this game ""Ultimate Spiderman Races.""The keyboard controls are clunkly and even with the mouse sensitivity dialed all the way down, the mouse is still too touchy.I will say that the artwork is good and the characters look like they do in the Ultimate universe but those are about the only good parts of the game.If you're bored and want an hour of fun, have a friend burn you a copy of this, but don't pay full price."
1,Didn't even finish it.,It was so bad that I didn't even finish it. I'm just glad that I bought it used and didn't waste too much money.
1,it seems false,"I have read 12 books on Near Death Experiences and a couple of unpublished manuscripts on the subject, from people of various religious beliefs. My heart and mind were expanded and trully blessed by the knowledge and spritual enlightment those people brought to us from heaven. This one book however, has been so far the only one that gave a feeling it is a fabricated story. Maybe not entirely, perhaps Kathie had some true experiences. I understand those experiences are very individual, ""taylor made"" to each person, but there are many commonalities. Yet, some aspects of Kathie's story are completely at odds with everything else we read of NDEs and the information they give about the nature of the spiritual world. More than that, it just doesn't feel true. Also, she would rather try to bring too much attention to herself with this ""Little One"" story."
4,Unafraid of passing,"This was a very easy to read and understand book. It certainly made me feel that death was nothing to fear, but to look forward to when it is time to pass. I envy her adventures to the other side with her beloved brother."
2,Flights of Fancy,"Kathie Jordan's intriguing tale recounting her nightly red-eye flights to Heaven while remaining on permanent stand-by in the hellish humdrum of daily accountancy is a reassuring validation of the old saying; out-of-body, out-of-mind."
3,"Taylor Smith, The Innocents Club","I have enjoyed Taylor Smith's books. I think that her background allows her to bring a depth to espionage books that is sometimes lacking. In The Innocents Club, I felt like she did not develop her characters enough to explain certain actions. For example, in the end of Guilt by Silence, Mariah's daughter likes and enjoys Paul; however, in The Innocents Club she dislikes him with no real understanding of why. Even Paul's character changes more than the books explains. The ending reminded me of a soap opera that had five minutes to tie up all lose ends. We never see the main characters react to their changed status, but we are only told about it. Maybe she is trying to lead us to continue finding out in the next book, but what if she loses us instead?"
3,thought it would work on everthing that a 1 or 2 GB,thought it would work on my Digital Picture Frame and My Treo. It doesn't see it . It works on my Cannon Camera but thats all Even the Computer doesn't recognize it. It doesn't work the same way as a 2 GB
3,1 out of 2 failed,"Bought 2 in March 2009. 1 failed during New Year celebration party. All pics are gone, shows a salad of different image chunks and 90% of them say ""image data is not available"". Trying to find out how to RMA it since they have a ""life time warranty"". Honestly, can't even find a way to properly fill their form (on Kingston site), way too unclear..."
1,Broke down twice already,"Probably I got the bad one, but this thing broke down twice already, with all my vacation pictures in it, twice gone. Money is not the issue here. But there is no way I can get back those vacation pictures again. Before I used the card I already formatted it with my digital camera so compatibility should not be any issue at all. THe first time it broke down, both my computers cannot recognize it so I ended up has to reformat the card again. The second time it cant be recognized at all leaving the card useless and all the pictures in it unreachable. Save yourself and buy better card. You dont wanna end up losing your pictures just for the sake of this cheapo card. I am warning you, dont be like me, lesson learned the hard way.."
1,Card failed within 3 weeks,"Used this for just under 3 weeks in my Canon DSLR. Then it failed with Canon ""Err 02"". Fortunately I didn't lose any images. I've been happy with Kingston products before, so perhaps I'm unlucky. It's going back!"
1,More Kingston Junk,"Worked for 3 weeks, then ""memory error"" occurred. Have not heard back from Kingston yet. Unreliable. Junk. Looking into SanDisk"
1,Bad news,"Lot number 4174139 made in Taiwan. Of course you can barely read it except in broad daylight. When a camera could read and it did work and then it didn't, I believe that is called failure. Nothing will format it now including the camera. So this review is for those who care about their pics. Luckily I had just moved a recent batch off before it crapped out. I had always been a fan of Kingston, but it just goes to show. I bought three of these, now I am wary of the other two. And yeah, it is not a question of the lock being engaged, but I suspect that element is somehow involved in the failure."
1,Won't fit in my Canon XSi,"I bought two of the Kingston 8GB Class 6 cards. Both cards were manufactured in Taiwan. Both of the cards will not fit properly into the SD slot of my Canon Rebel XSi. When you put the card into the slot, the slot's springs do not engage. In order to get the card out of the slot you have to pull it out instead of pushing the card in to release the springs. I have a Kingston Micro SDHC card with an SD adapter and I have no problem at all using it in my Canon camera. I will return the cards and get a different brand."
1,My card died in a month....,"I got this Class 6 SDHC card free with my HF100 camcorder and in about a month it died. The camcorder with this card just says ""Check the card"" and will not let you format or re-initialize the card. A PC doesn't even recognize the card.Guess you get what you pay for....nothing."
1,Don't waste your money - Corrupt card lost images and video,Don't waste your money on this SD card. Bought one for my Canon digital camera. In less than one year it started corrupting images and video clips. I will never buy another Kingston memory card. Check out Amazon's reviews on the Kingston 2GB SD card - more of the same data corruption issues.
4,works great,"i like it a lot. no problems at all. 4 star because it could be faster, but its really a pleasure to have."
1,Poor Performance - Looses pictures frequently,"I purchased this to use with my panasonic Lumix. It frequently looses pictures and gets locked up, requiring cycling power to camera. I us other brand cards such as fuji and do not have any issue with the same camera.Buyer Beware"
1,Stopped working after one year and all data lost,It Just stopped wrking after one year and all the data was lost.Cheap - and disposable.Next time - Sandisk.
1,BEWARE!! NOT CLASS 6!!! DO NOT USE FOR T1i-500D,"I bought this card for my canon T1i DSLR, I was told I needed a class 6 card to record video. The card was sooo slow to write to the disk that it stopped recording after about 30 seconds of video-this card is a piece of JUNK!!!! I don't know how they pull off calling this a class 6 card when it is so slow. After reading other reviews on here I won't even bother contacting Kingston for a replacement, I'm sure I will get the same thing in return. I now use a Transcend brand which is 100 times better and cheaper!!!!!!!! I can now record videos continously."
2,constantly get file errors,crap...constantly get file read erros.. ive lossed dozens of pictures or couldnt take a video because it would crap out and then freeze my camera... my cam works great with other memory card.
5,I vouch for this card.,"I haven't been using this card for very long, but I did my research. ""Class 6"" means that this card transfers data at 6mb/sec. I am using it to record video from my canon zr830 at 320x240. For that use, it seems to be good and well exceeds the 2mb/sec (class 2) requirement of the camcorder.~phillip"
3,8 gig card,"I have had a fast and reliable service so far but one card has had to be sent back due to a fault on it.I have multiple appliances that use SD cards and was unable to get any of them to get it to work in any of them . In the blurb it states that not all SD cards will work in all appliances, this was surely the case with this one although i am just hoping it was a faulty one and will get a refund."
3,Suddenly died,"Everything went well with this card (remember only sdhc card readers are compatible with it, not any sd slot will read it) untill i plugged it into a computer that slipped a trojan horse (a very mild virus) into it, and boom lost 150 pictures and the card just died, it cant be used or formated.I know its bad for a virus to get into your card, but i didnt think i would loose the card after a month i got it..."
4,great card,I use this in my HD camcorder and I have yet to fill it up on more than one battery charge. It is a great card to have on a trip without having to worry if I have any room left.
3,Not the best card out there,"I bought this card for use in my dSLR. It works, sort of. The card seems to be a bit too big, so it jams in the slot instead of being spring loaded. I can pull it out with a thumbnail, but it's still quite annoying. I have two of these cards, so it was not a single bad item.Write speed is not as good as my SD(not-HC) cards, but I expected that. Still, it's noticeable."
1,Beware - Akarma release is a bootleg,"Be aware that there are two releases of this CD. The one from Italy on the Akarma label is a bootleg. Neither the band, the owner nor the publisher are being paid.The legitimate version was released by Pacemaker (Canada) / Lion Productions (USA). Royalties are paid to the owners and publishers."
3,Average,"Frank, Joe, Chet and Biff go to northern Canada to locate an ancient Viking rune stone that was recently stolen from the man who found it. This is an average book, so there is not much to say about it really. The plot isn't bad and there is a moderate amount of action. Most fans will probably not be overly excited about this book, but it shouldn't bore them either."
1,A grain of salt,"It is amazing to me that the psychological community is still putting Bruno Bettelheim out there as some kind of authority. This is the same man who made up a theory of autism -- that it was caused by ""refrigerator moms"" -- that caused intense pain for a generation of mothers trying to help their autistic children. (His theory was based on his opinion, not scientific research.) This is also the same supposed doctor who started a sham school for autistic kids that was later shut down by the University of Chicago. Bettelheim went on to write more interesting theories -- including one that blamed the Jews for not standing up for themselves and thereby suffering the Holocaust.Bettelheim never received a degree in psychology, as he purported when he emigrated from Europe during WW2. He managed to get himself on TV, though (our first Dr. Phil) and he could write convincingly.Please, before you read this book, consider the source!"
1,Not a toy! So why is it listed under 'Toys & Games',"Beware, this is not a toy - we got one similar for our sons and come to find out that the ""fine print"" on the front of the box says ""Limited Edition Adult Collectable"". So why in the world does the Manufacturer's Recommended age on Amazon say ""12 months and up""???? Talk about dangerous! It's metal and the edges are sharp. It breaks very easily and in no way is child friendly! This is a collectible (hobby) - not a ""toy""."
5,Adorable Tea Infuser,"This is an adorable tea infuser featuring a whimsical ceramic cup for weight and a well made ""tea ball"" to infuse your leaf tea perfectly every time. Delightful stocking stuffer or extra gift for that tea lover in your life! :)"
2,Not the best :/,"I orderd this because I thought it would get the job done, but it leaves tea floating at the top of the cup ):. Its very easy to open thoe."
4,Cooking with Style and Flare,I love the restaurant Abigael's. These recipes really work. This is my go to book when the family is bored and is willing to try something new. I am a huge fan of Jeff Nathan. I really believe these recipes are tested and re-tested. There is nothing unusual or far-fetched when it comes to the ingredients. I think anyone will enjoy the book and for the price you can't go wrong.
2,POOR SOUND QUALITY,I don't know what kind of equipment that other reviewer has but this does not sound good at all to me. Recorded in 1956 but not released on LP until 1985 ought to tell you something. If you are contemplating buying this you probably have heard Bud live with Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All Stars and should probably quit while you are ahead. Better to snatch up another Art Pepper-Live say - Live At Donte's (1968)2CD's with Tenorman Joe Romano. This is Art at his straight forward best. Also Art's RENASCENCE- Quartet Live 1975 using Tadd Dameron's-Good Bait- as a lead off tune is infinitely better than this Disaster at The Haig
5,Kendall DURAsorb Underpads 23 X 36,"People, puppies or projects, these pads handle the misshaps. Good size for a variety of uses. Latex free is a plus."
4,"Fun, but the string is too short!","My boys have fun with this toy, but the string that holds the little bone shaped mallot isn't long enough. My almost 3 year old gets annoyed with it because he can't reach the other end of the keys with the mallot. Plus, he wants badly to drag it behind him and watch the puppy's tail move, but it's not long enough for him to stand up and pull it behind him. Both of my boys (the youngest is 11 months) have fun banging away on the keys. It's fun to listen to their ""songs""!"
1,It burns!,"Watch out for this product. I used it for my upper lip and a few minutes after pulling off the strips, my skin got red and itchy. I ended up getting a rash that didn't stop itching for over a week. I'd test it out in a less obvious spot first..but you may be allergic like me."
4,Noir poetry,"Michael Madsen poetry is, in my opinion, noirish, Americana, time capsule, insightful, and anecdotal. Poetic but not necessarily poetry. Each individual writing is not so much an imparting of information but rather and invitation to be on the same sidewalk as Michael. Much of the collection reads like a long and lonely road triip. Perhaps his experiences are not unique but they are highly personal to him and he does not skimp or hold back in his sharing. That's the key here. Ride along with him."
3,Not Lego's best,"I read this book aloud to my tween sons who are Lego fans. The story was not babyish. The main flaw was that the first chapter was kind of confusing. The book seemed to assume that readers would be familiar with the characters and other aspects of Knights' Kingdom.The book is illustrated with drawings on each two-page spread. The cover art is not representative of the art inside the book (which are much simpler).Of the Lego Readers, we enjoyed ""Mission to the Arctic"" better. FYI: The arctic book is DK ""Level 3 Reading Alone"", while The Grand Tournament is Scholastic Reader Level 4 ""First chapter books for advanced beginners""."
1,customer service is no-service they will not answer emails,"product works all but one side of marker lights, Customer no service is what they have. They do not answer emails. I will never buy another produt with their name on it"
5,Truth!,"This is a very well written book full of truth! Harris provides some solid doctrine on the issue of lust, and provides Word-centered guidance on how to cultivate holiness/purity."
5,Finally the Topic is Broached Properly,"I believe this book ought to be read rather than Every Young Man's Battle. This book is cleaner (no unneeded lude descriptions), it makes solid points, it is directed at both men and women, and it stays close to scripture all the way through. This book will get the legalism out of your battle with lust, and remind you that a biblical battle with lust will always have desiring Christ and a closer walk with Him who has already declared christians righteous despite their struggles and failures at the center of it."
3,"Same book as ""Not Even a Hint""","I think Joshua Harris did a great job with his ""Not Even a Hint"" book, which is why I turned to this one for further insight... However I found (upon reading the first page!) that it's pretty much the same exact book as ""Not Even a Hint"" so although this book is probably great, since ""Not Even a Hint"" was great, don't bother with this one if you've read the other. Compare the tables of content online if you don't believe me!"
5,Lust not Sex is the problem,Satan will use the same weakness over and over until we sober up and make every effort to please God with all our being...this was an easy read especially for someone who doesn't like to read as myself with the exception of hobby how to's!
5,Amazing book. Everything he says is true.,Everything Josh writes is true and convicting. His practical advice and theological reasons for things are great and Biblical. I highly recommend this book for those struggling with sexual sin or those wanting to know more about sexual temptation in general.
4,Not even an Hint,Awesome book that addresses my struggles and how to deal with it.Highly recommended to both single and married couple.Loved it
4,Much common sense - some quirky notions,"I have to admit that I agreed with much of what Joshua has written in this book. I would recommend it to young poeple in my church youth group. However, as with all issues that are dealt with in books WE need to do the hard work of seeing if these things be so in the Bible. As one reviewer has complained I also would like to see some more indepth exegesis, but then many young poeple might not read it. After reading it I was a little confused as to the place of God's grace and the work of the Holy Spirit and our effort. Joshua needed to spend a little more time on that issue as I have found that a lack of clear teaching on this issue (sanctification) is what leads to the emotional problems that some of the reviewers have mentioned. I would recommend young poeple to read ""The Enemy Within"" by Kris Lungard to get another angle on the whole issue of indwelling sin."
2,"The title was interesting, but the reading was disappointing.","A lot of research was reviewed, and there is a good reference list. In my view, the tennis strokes have some basic guidelines that almost every professional tennis player follows. And those basic guidelines can be mechanically analyzed, with physical explanations. But you won't find this in this book, the analysis lacks depth.In the serve chapter you can read: ""Coaches and players would love simple and easy answers to the questions of what is the best sequence and what is the most important joint motion in a flat serve. Unfortunately, the complexity of the body and individual differences make this very unlikely."""
1,Better to Look Elsewhere,"I must say that I can follow any given technical manual but this book just does not motivate me to do so. The book is rather dull and requires work to follow, and I din not feel that it would be worthwhile to find out what was awaiting at the end of each chapter. It is rather thin, and tries to cover the topic of tennis mechanics, but in my opinion does a poor job.I am a solid 4.5 player and this book did not help me to fill in any missing holes required to move on to the next level. This book might be helpful to a 3.0 to 3.5 player who still need to see another perspective on understanding the mechanics of a tennis swing. There are much easier ways to achieve this, however. Lastly, the illustrations seemed distorted and this was really annoying to me. I would have rather seen a live model demonstrating these points."
3,A good and gentle story,"I wanted to love this book, but I came away from reading it wondering what all the fuss was about. A good and gentle story of a good and gentle dog and his good and gentle boy."
3,"I should have loved this book, but","I wanted to love this book, but I came away from reading it wondering what all the fuss was about. A good and gentle story of a good and gentle dog and his good and gentle boy."
5,MY DOG SKIP,THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES SINCE I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT APPROXIMATELY 10 YEARS AGO. IT IS SO SWEET AND BITTERSWEET! THE MOVIE ALSO FOLLOWS THE BOOK PRETTY WELL.
4,About a boy and his dog...,"This book is the story of Willie Morris' childhood companion, a dog named Skip. Willie recounts his adolescent years and all the fond memories of his dog and friends as they grew up together in small town Mississippi. The story is heartwarming and the author paints a very clear picture of all the shenanigans, good times and bad that he and his dog had together over the years. I liked this book; but I think a male reader would appreciate the bond between a boy and his dog more than I can."
2,Did NOT Love this book,"Am I the only one who thought this was the dullest book they'd ever read? The time-shifting narrative is difficult enough for a grown-up to follow, much less the 5th graders who were assigned this book. The stories were sweet, but as a book, the whole thing lacked any plot tension. It read more like a series of anecdotes than a story. I kept waiting for the plot to start. The English teacher who assigned this book agreed it was dull, but said it was assigned because of its place in our local heritage."
5,Amazing Book with a Real Heart,"I think this is hands-down my favorite book. In intellectual conversation I'll always say Michael Creighton is my favorite author but this book has such a special place in my heart. It's not any sort of epic novel but it's not meant to be. It's the true story of a man reflecting on his boyhood with his dog. The story is funny, endearing, and most of all - real. This is a must-read if you are a dog lover."
3,Okay,"Okay, but over rated. A bit on the sappy side. Wouldn't have chosen it had it not been a choice my book club made!"
5,Simple and wonderful!,Magic is the word that could describe this album! The simplicity of the melodies and the singing with the modern Vangelis'arrangements create a unique atmosphere. It is a Greek album with a particular modern color thanks to Vangelis and Irene Papas. Even if it was recorded more than 20 years ago sound so fresh and new! Highly recommended!
2,Anthems sung in Greek are interesting but not entertaining,"The melodies have a patriotic/militaristic style which is jarring. Irene Papas has a strong, low voice but it is not musical. I find I have to work to listen through the tracks, unlike most other vangelis works which transport me."
3,"Mostly taken from singles, different than album versions","Made in HOL in 2000, Serial# BS-8123-2, Playing Time: 155 min.This 2-disc set chronologically compiles tracks up to their 1988 ""Sur La Mer"" album.Unless you own the CD version of ""The Magnificient Moodies"", the present collection will give you many early non-album tracks, while the more recent material, from the ""Long Distance Voyager"" to ""Sur La Mer"" era, is generally presented here in their singles (and shorter) form.The last few years have seen many compilations of this band, but ""The Singles+"" stands out as a great collection of songs that will give the uninitiated 2-and-a-half hours of pleasure, while giving CD collectors of the Moodies versions only previously available on their 7-inch vinyls."
2,Moodies Singles,"No complaint regarding the music. My main criticism is in the editing of the songs. Some intros and outros have been shortened, which I find quite unfortunate. I would rather do away with the first 10 tracks which are from the mark 1 of the band, and have complete versions of the other tracks (personal opinion.)"
4,Sure It's Good--But Who Really Needs It?,"The Moody Blues new compilation is really quiet complete. It's great but who needs it? For a band that had a lack of greatest hits packages until 1990 the Moodies sure have made up for lost time. From 1990 to date the Moody Blues have had MANY greatest hits albums and, with a few exceptions, they all have the same songs. We've all heard ""I know you're out there somewhere"" or ""Wildest Dreams"" so there's little point in owning them again in another package. So, I suppose you'd like to know, why would a Moodies fan buy this CD? Well they have included several songs from the pre-Days of Future Past era and they kind of collect all of them together from different sources. If you want to hear the formation of this great band, and you don't have the album ""Prelude"" then buy this one. If you have to have it at any cost please note that you've probably got most of these already"
5,Back To The Old School,"If you like that old school flavor, then this is the perfect album to pick up. Everything about this album makes you want to listen to it more."
3,Help Me! What IS that sample used in 'Tramp'??,"Tramp is a great song, and this is driving me nuts! There are two vocal song samples used in this track, with one just being the word 'tramp', which I'm sure is Lowell Fulson from the original version of the song.(edit: it's actually Joe Tex, from the song 'Papa Was Too') The second sample, the one that I need to know about, is a very long one. Goes - ""She wants to ride on home in your car. She wants...."" The voiceprint reminds me most of one of the lead singers from the classic 60's rock group Spirit, Jay Ferguson. It's the only name I can put to the voice. If anyone knows what song and artist it is, please post. Don't have a copy of the liner notes, so don't know if the samples are listed in the credits. Please help this headached D.J."
4,"Keeps your ""BOOMBOX"" boomin'!!!","Blueprint is one of the very few artists that wears his heart on his sleeve and just gives it his all every time he laces a mic. Thankfully, more times than not this results in fantastic wordplay, humourous anticdotes+stories and ferocious flows when he's in battle-mode. As the title ""1988"" suggests, Blueprint attempts to recreate the ""golden era"" of real hiphop and for the most part he suceeds hands down. Tracks like ""anything is possible"", ""1988"" (my favourite), ""inner-city native son"", ""tramp"" (hilarious), ""big girls need love too"" and ""fresh"" make this release a must have for any Rhymesayers/real hiphop fan!! Other highlights were ""kill me 1st"", ""trouble on my mind"", ""liberated"" and its hidden bonus track ""common sense"". Infact FOR ME the only downers on this were ""boombox"" ""lo-fi funk"" and ""where's ya girlfriend at?"". Apart from that its phat from start to finish. Go pick it up, you wont be disapointed."
4,"Not a review; rather, a question",Does the album come with a lyric booklet? I'm a deaf rap fan who hears with a cochlear implant.
5,definite sizzler,now here's a fantasy to make a woman's wildest dreams come true & believe me mine are wild. would love to see more native stories from this author. how about contemporary. it's cold & snowy up here but this one'll keep you warm throught the long dark night.
3,The fires of paradise,"I loved the story. The editing was horrible. For the money spent, I expect better editing and attention to detail"
1,Not believable at all,I was very surprised by the great reviews of this book. I could not get into it at all and did not think it was anywhere close to believable.
2,Just ok for me...,"""The Fires of Paradise"" was the last in the Bragg series and although it was nice to find out how all the Bragg's were doing, this book wasn't that great. It started out with a good and fast pace, but then it turned into a lot of filler. I'll be honest, I expected so much more from this superb writer, but that's ok, I'm still a big fan!"
2,Funny but very short,"This book is less than one hundred pages, in large print, with an odd page size. In other words, it's more a pamphlet than a book. For the price, I found the brevity very disappointing.However, the concent was extremely funny, and did teach me at least one rather delightful phrase I had never heard before."
5,A must buy.,I'm going to buy this book for myself to read. If it is what I expect it to be I might loan it to my German friend. She never has a real clue about what we are talking about half the time when we use um Crude language and cant join in on the jokes. :) well Im LMAO :)
3,Amusing,"I didn't really pay attention to the title of this book when purchasing. While it's amusing, funny, and informative it wasn't quite what I was expecting. However a co-worker's wife had just finished taking a course in teaching English as a Second Language. He took my new copy to give to his wife and it was a major success. He purchased a new copy to replace mine. Either way it's worth the paltry price."
1,Save Your Time,"Pubescent boys will find the book humorous. This old coot, however, finds it contrived and something of an insult to the fine art of profane conversation."
3,not for ESL,"I bought this book to help some of my ESL students to understand how/when to use American swear words.....however, it is definitely not a good reference in that sense. Although it IS funny, it is more of a narrative and not a resource."
2,"Occasional flashes of wit; otherwise, nothing new here","I thought this was going to be a GREAT book, based on the title, but it's actually pretty lame. Probably real exciting reading for an eighth grader who is just starting out a good bad-word repertoire: trained professionals will need to look elsewhere for new and creative expletives."
4,Take it for what it's worth,The book is a good chuckle for a couple 30 minutes rides on the exercize bike.It's written in a very serious an authoritative tone. It writes about what the esteemed panel recommends for alternatives to sh*t and f*ck. It talks about the grammer of swearing. Seriously.Will it really teach anyone to swear? No - you should know this by now.Is it really aimed at teaching someone swearing jargon? No on that front too.Is it good humor for someone who asks their friends to pull their finger? Absolutely!
3,A mediocre book.,Cussers will learn nothing new in this book...except the correct grammer in which to use those words we all know and love to hate. I was disappointed with this book...but I must say the test at the end of the book is fun.
2,Not so f*cking funny,"I must have a funny bone missing or something. This trite little book was a big yawn from start to finish. The only thing I can say in its favour is that, living and working in France as I do, it will be a little easier to explain some of the peculiarities of the English language to the natives."
3,It's ok,"So i just got this today and was a tad disappointed. that lip at the bottom looked like a cushion for the tailbone or something, its not, just a flap. They also use a plastic, yes it seems dense ""ish"" to me it seems it might protect from minor falls. but mabey it could do more i dont know and i hope not to have to test it, i give this 3 stars cause it seems like it will help but i dont think its worth 70$, 40-50$ mabey"
5,Your Own Star Wars Adventure,"In this tiny little book, there are dozens of many different twists and turns you can take throughout the Star Wars universe. The story opens with you being friends with Luke Skywalker and finding out his family's new astro droid (R2-D2) has gone missing and you join Luke to recover it. From there on, you are on your own making your own choices as to what happens to you. However unlike most Choose Your Own Adventure series, when you make a decision, the consequences do not only affect you, but all the well known characters of the original film as well. For example, there is an ending where Obi-Wan Kenobi survives. And as for bad endings, well you could get killed early by the Sand People or turn to the dark side and betray Luke and the rebellion, or just simply fail to help the Rebellion destroy the Death Star.So many directions...so many paths...towards whatever fate. The choice can only be yours."
3,Rodd1284's review of Paice Ashton Lord long awaited CD,"I've been trying to find this CD for a year or so now and was pleased to finally receive it, and let my brother have a copy. Both of us thought the live bonus tracks at the end were pretty excellent but the others fairly mediocre. We're now getting a copy of the Paice Ashton Lord Live at the BBC CD and hopefully it will be better value."
3,NOT PURPLE,"I thought I was the only one who had this album. I got it based on the fact that two of favorite musicians are one it, Jon Lord and Ian Paice. This is not Deep Purple nor did I expect it to be. It's a pretty good and interesting rock album with a blues edge. Some people may know guitarist Bernie Marsden from early Whitesnake and he's a fine player. I got it for a lot less than it is selling for here. It's worth checking out if you're not expecting Highway Star and can get it for a reasonable price. My favorite track is the funky Silas and Jerome. No matter what, Lord and Paice will always have my respect and admiration.[...]"
5,Cute drip container,A great design that stops drips from the spout while adding a little whimsy to your tea time.
4,Fun Video,"My 2 year old loves, loves, LOVES this video. That being said, the video is misnamed. There is one short story about colors and nothing about shapes. What you will find are several short stories and a few cute Maisy music videos. This is a very fun video, but only somewhat educational. Consider it like a collection of clips you would see on the Maisy TV show."
3,Colors but not shapes! Disappointing.,"We're Maisy crazy at our house, led by our 16 month old. I recently got two videos for him. I was very pleased with Counting with Maisy. It delivers just what one would expect. Colors and shapes does not, however. They do a nice job of working in colors, but no shapes! Spots and stripes are mentioned, but I don't consider them shapes. Disappointed. I will continue to buy Maisy tapes because my little one loves them so. I hope the rest are as good as the counting one."
2,Don't buy if you are serious about trekking,"I had a good mind in investing in an Osprey backpack and had been tracking prices for a long time. Seeing a similar backpack - Nebo's - for 40$, I figured it would be worth it as I wasnt going to trek too much this year. Right from the start, the bag was a disaster. There is not too much volume to place your stuff inside even though the bag looks huge. There is a sleeping bag compartment or something of that sort with a black body bag that hands loose. It is practically useless. The plastic snaps that can be used to tighten the straps were just that - plastic. Trying to roll my bag into place and tightening it, the plastic snapped and flew on my face. And I hadnt even started packing yet. It is made in China. Need I say more! Do not trust your fun trip with this. an Eastsport school bag will serve you better. Atleast mine has!"
4,Well worth the money,"I'm not claiming this to be a pro-level backpacking bag, but it served me exceptionally well on my two week trip to europe. There are a ton of pockets inside and out side of the main compartment, so it was good for organizing different adaptors, toothbrushes, etc. Some people said snaps or other plastic parts were breaking on them, but I didn't have any of those problems, I just lost a little cord from a zipper. The shoulder height adjustment things are a little tricky to get right, but they help to distribute the load pretty well."
5,fan-frickin-tastic,"This backpack went thru the rough & tumble of Costa Rica and was a) comfortable, and b) durable. Being small (5'), it was quite comfy to walk around with. I fully recommend anyone who is looking for a backpack at a GREAT price to buy this one!(there you go, sports team!)"
3,Very nice backpack with no frils or extras,"I bought this back-pack and took it to India for Himalayan treks. Nice pack with essential design but no extras like Ice-axe loops, rope loops etc.The nice thing is having a seperate bottom loading sleeping bag cmpartment and the top loading main compartment. Carries suffience load and while thematerial is a bit on the light side, it still packs in a puch and take a load for a weekend winter trip.Strap stiches are a bit weak - if too heavy loads, then staps show a bit of strain - but they haven't torn or anything in my 3 treks with full loads.Have given it to my sister and she loves it - since its not too big for her - its ideal for small-medium built persons.Good backpack for the budget."
5,Great pack!,"I bought this pack for hunting and I just got back from my first trip with it. The pack is extremely comfortable, has lots of cargo space, nice collection of straps on the outside to hook things and everything is easily accessible within the pack. The little rain cover concealed in a zippered pocket on the bottom is a nice touch. Excellent pack and a great value. I love it!"
1,WORST QUALITY PRODUCT EVER.,"I read the reivews of the products from other customers, and most were okay, but a few were less than pleased with the product. 1st off the internal frame is poorly designed. It's only 2 metal rods that does not give the person using this back pack enough uppper support, so the back sags when it's on. The material and stiching is poor. I used this for a 2 day hike, all the stitching started to rip apart at the seams. The plastic pieces holding the straps that are curcial to the person who wears the backpack snapped. I had to jerry rig the backpack just to make it through the second day of hiking. I can't believe that some made for the wilderness can be suck a piece of junk. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!"
2,i wanted to like it,as I love his stuff from the blue tumb days forward. this missed the mark on the sonmgs for me. still respect the guy a ton
4,"2 Years and it still works OK, BUT","It does not have a polarized plug, it gets warm when working, and it is not 240 watts unless you count all the heat it puts out, and I would not recommend using it unless you are close by just in case it catches on fire.I do use it with several new and old devices with non polarized plugs such as my AC cell phone chargers, my 50 year old lamp, and hard wired to many AC devices in my lab.I am happy with my purchase, and 2 years later it still works and has never set anything on fire yet, but I paid $16 with free shipping in 2010, and it's not worth much more."
2,Disappointing,"This flashlight has a single xenon bulb surrounded by 6 LEDs. Now, one would assume that you'd get brighter light but shorter battery life with the xenon and vice-versa. Not the case. The center/xenon bulb is much weaker than the LEDs. Makes no sense. So, realistically you have the choice of quite bright bluish LEDs or a not so bright, more yellow xenon bulb. Unless I just got a bum flashlight, I'd recommend say up a little bit and getting something like the Streamlight Twin-Task."
4,Great addition,"We bought this toy when my son was about a year old. I thought he would enjoy the sound effects, etc. We have several other little people sets and he enjoys playing with all of them. This is a nice addition to his collection. I do like how the construction workers are girls with this set."
2,it doesn't do much,"This is the worst little people toy we have. It doesn't do much at all, and the sounds it makes are too easily triggered, and annoying. I wouldn't buy this again."
2,"Fun for kids, bad for parents","My little boy (2 1/2) loved this toy when he first got it two months ago. My biggest complaint with the toy is that it has such obnoxious sound effects that go off with the slightest little movement. (Really, I think that sometimes it might go off just by looking at it the wrong way!) I probably wouldn't keep it around if my boy didn't like it so much. I suppose most toys are noisy, and most don't bother me, but this one does."
5,"Finally, some creative original music.","Tired of the same music all the time? Then you have to hear this CD. This CD really has a unique sound. Whenever I try to describe it I say ""It's like 311 with a horns section, yet better."" This music is very hard to classify. It is a CD that you can listen to over and over again because you will hear something new every time. Rye Allstars is a group that you must hear to believe and experience on your own the creative vibes."
3,Would have loved it....if I got the right cable,"I can't really rate the item itself because when I ordered it, I instead got a 25 foot VGA cable (for a computer monitor) instead.However the order was processed quickly and I got the item quickly. How it got re-labelled as this item I'm not sure.I'm in the return process now and its going quickly. I'm thinking someone just messed up on labelling it.Hopefully my issue will prevent others from meeting the same fate...."
3,Closer to 2.5,"I generally prefer my John Lawton with a bit more oomph. Having thoroughly enjoyed Trick in the Tale I found this a little tame, but having said that it is a CD that is very easy to listen to and contains live versions of a some great songs. The band is very tight and JL sounds as good as ever, which goes without saying I guess. I don't think any fan of JL will be disappointed with this album, but don't expect too much flat out rockin'. It's well worth a listen though."
3,Good book but not great,"I enjoyed this Dick Francis but thought it was far less good than the first in this series with this main charcater, sid Haley.The story struggles to be believeable in several places."
3,Too much violence - not enough horses,"This was the first racing-related Dick Francis book I've read. For my taste, it didn't have enough to do with horses although the medical parts were interesting. I didn't care for the two different subplots - would have preferred just one. I thought Sid was a pretty wimpy character, and I was waiting for him to defend himself in some way. Instead he was just dumb enough to keep allowing himself to get into dangerous situations."
1,Item never arrived !,I am still waiting for this item to be delivered.Del. was anticipated to be made by Dec. 20.I was unable to find a way of tracking this item or advising the supplier that I had not received it.Can you help ?
2,Test DVD,"This DVD turned out to be some test for a Dolby Surround sound. It had only 6 songs and they were very short with weird videos that didn't make any sense. Not what we expected at all. Should not have paid $8 for it, maybe like $2 at a discout seller or something. Very disappointed."
2,Major disappointment,"I love this group and I was really excited. What a waste. There are about five selections - maybe 20 minutes altogether. Two are 'God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen' from the same concert. I love them both (it's one of my favorite carols), but when you've only got a few videos you'd at least like different songs. Save your money for tickets to see them live."
2,Small amount of music but a lot of camera movement. BAD!,Excellent group but the camera shots keep up with the music which made visual enjoyment lacking.
1,DVD Review,Was very disappointed! Have been a fan of this group for alot of years and was hoping to see the group in action playing their instruments. Then they give us a taste of other DVD's and you can't even find them to buy them!
1,Disappointing!,"I just purchased this DVD and the Christmas Celebration DVD. When I think of a DVD I think of videos! I was so excited about these when I saw them, I expected something like the first VHS video ""A Fresh Aire Christmas"". What a disappointment. I really feel mis-lead and like a wasted alot of money for nothing. I sure hope you can make a real DVD for us in the near future."
2,Not for Mountain Bikes,"While the book has a couple of mountain bike trails, this book is more for Road bikes. The mountain bike trails in this book are know to most who ride on Long Island. The book is also dated"
3,Not sure.....,"how I feel about this book, my first Ballard. So I looked for other readers' reviews. Found two. One giving it 1 star; the other 5 stars. I can understand. Found it new, interesting, clever. But now half-way through the book I'm wondering if I even want to continue. I don't know where it's going --- but do I care?"
4,Bing is synonymous with WWII music,"On this CD, Bing Crosby sings some of the classic WWII standards and does them quite well, as always. Unfortunately, not too many of Bing's hits are on this CD, so I suppose it comes down to whether you enjoy Bing's hits or a great singer doing great songs. If you prefer the latter, this CD is for you."
4,My baby loves this toy!,"This is one of his favorite toys. He always gets so exicted when he sits and plays it and he also first learned to pull up and balance himself on it. That said, there is a downside, and that is why I gave it four stars. He has fallen down many times against the sides of this toy because it moves so easily. One word of advice is to keep it against something like a couch or wall. I have to be literally right next to him ready to catch him if he falls. I am nervous about when he uses it is a table and tries to walk with it. All in all though, it is a wonderful toy and am glad we purchased it."
4,Good buy!!!,"I agree with most of the other parents comment that this is a great toy and extremely easy to assemble. My child loves this toy!!!! However, the only reasons why I am giving this a 4Star is that the orange plastic (above the star) is loose (keeps coming off). Also, the sound is just a little loud even though I have it on the lowest volume. Other than that, no major compliant."
5,Great toy from birth on!,I bought this for my grandchild when she was born. She loved it then because she could kick it with her feet laying on her back. Then she loved to use it when she could sit up and it changed positions for her to use and it was easy to change. She is now 13 months old and still likes to play with it. It's the best toy she has had for her first year of life. It changes to three different positions and the music is cute and it can also be changed with the child's ability. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. It would be a great shower gift.
2,The exception,"I bought this toy for my baby after reading all the great reviews and I guess we are the exception. My daughter has shown only slight interest in this toy since it's purchase last Christmas. Now almost a year later, it sits in the garage. Aside from that, I found the music pretty annoying."
2,Wood Floors + Protruding Toy Legs=Many Falls for Baby,"One of the biggest complaint I have about this toy is that its legs stick out too much. Now that my daughter is walking, she'll play with the toy in its upright position, then walk away to play with something else and trip over its legs. Since we have wood floors, she's had many falls, the most recent of which caused her to have a fat lip for a week. The toy now sits legless on the floor."
3,help,I recently saw this gymn at the store and liked it for its versatility.The fact that it does not become completely useless after the first months really impressed me and the colors are bright and attractive.my only concern is whether the toys that hang down can hurt the baby?usually all playmats and gymn seem to have soft toys?please help
5,Great Buy!,"I bought this toy for my son when he was just a little bundle of joy. It was a great entertainment, and I even noticed he had a favorite song. Now, at 10 months, the love is still going strong, since now he has fun standing and playing the piano, which sings in a soothing chorus voice. (and my daughter even loves it at age 4)"
2,It's a little loud,"We received this gift for my 4 month old daughter for Christmas. She seems to enjoy watching the stars light up as the music plays. I can let her lie on the floor for about ten minutes and the toy will entertain her. The only complaint that I have is the fact that even on the lowest level, the music is so loud. My husband and I think that is why she only tolerates the toy for so long. We have placed tape over the speakers to help muffle the sound. I really do like this toy, but I think Fisher Price should have provided this toy with a sound dial so that the parent could monitor the sound level. All in all a great toy but a little to loud."
4,Great toy,My daughter loved this toy. This toy was my daughter's favorite toy between the ages of 3-6 months (now she loves the Jumparoo). At first she just laid under it and stared at the lights and listened to the music until she was able to reach and grab. This replaced her Gymini which she never really cared for. She loves to kick the keys with her feet as well. She gets so excited when she plays with it that she kicks it away from her. The only negative I can say is that I wish it had rubber feet so it wouldn't scoot away on the floor when she gets excited. I end up putting the legs in my shoes on the floor so it stays put.
4,chorus gym,"my baby is just starting to get old enough to enjoy this. she is able to lie on her back, reach up and hit the toys that hang down and hear the music. The lights also catch her eye. I think she will enjoy it more and more as she progresses. The music is not irritating or annoying for me as a parent to listen to over and over."
4,Very Good Toy,"We got this toy for our son for Christmas, he was six months old at the time and at a stage where nothing seemed to keep his attention for very long, but this toy held and still holds his attention for quite some time, the only drawback that I have discoverd is the orange reflection shield came off and now won't stay on, my son would take it off every chance he got so we finally just took it off completly, I was afraid that he would be standing up and pull it off and fall and possiably get hurt, other than that it's a great toy all the way around."
3,"My son really liked it, but not durable","I bought the gym for my son when he was 2 mons old. He really liked the sounds and lights, and when he was bigger, he liked the to reach for the toys that hung down. When he was about 4-5 mons old, he would kick the toys with his feet, and he kicked it off the bed, once. After that it was never the same. Now, a year later, it doesn't even play or light up at all and I've changed the batteries several times. My suggestion is to be really careful with it!!"
4,Nice versatile gym but there's room for improvement,"This is a nice gym that my son plays with every morning, but it definitely has some quirks. He likes to play with both the keys and the hanging toys, but we usually turn off the sound when he plays with the hanging toys because they tend to make a little too much noise. Probably my biggest complaint about this gym is that it slides when he plays with it. There needs to be a gripping surface on the bottom of the legs so it doesn't slide away from him whether he plays with his hands or feet. It's a fun toy that he likes but there are definitely a few changes that would improve it."
5,Thank you from a Music Teacher,"This item was given to me by my sister and we have used it everyday since! My son is now 6 months old and is beginning to use it in the Stage 2 position as he is learning to sit up (with the help of the Bobby pillow). He loved to play with it before while on his back but now that he can ""play"" the notes sitting up, he loves it even more. He especially loves playing along with me while I am at our piano.The only negative - the voice/piano sounds that it makes can be a bit annoying but I am a voice teacher so it might bother me more than you!"
5,This is a transitional toy...birth to toddler,"I starting using this chorus gym when my daughter was only 2 months old. My only regret is I didn't lay her under it sooner. She loved looking at the lights and listening to the music, she would follow the lights with her eyes. I believe that music and lights definately promotes learning. Now that she is 8 months old, I have changed the position of the gym and she sits and plays it like a piano and still LOVES it. Great toy, great gift, great educator.I wish there were more toys like this."
5,Great entertainment,My son really enjoys this gym. It offers just enough challenge for hitting toys and a great reward.
5,No more Bred Baby!!!!,"My baby was getting bored of her toys at 2 1/2 months old. She is laid back and really relaxed. Sleeps through the night, but wantst to talk and play while awake. This is the only play gym that can keep her entertained for more than 5 mins. She talks to it, loves to bat and hold onto the toys. I would reccommend this gym to anyone and its durable."
4,Great.... but...,"I loved this toy, and so does my daughter (4 months)... however, she gets very frustrated at the dangly toys. They really should have made them more sensitive. IT takes a VERY hard blow from the baby to make the music come on.... Oh well, she'll like it more when she can sit im sure..."
5,Great toy!,Bought this for my son when he was 4 months old. Very very happy with it! He loves it! He smiles as soon as we put it over him. It took him no time to figure out batting at the toys or keys would change the music. I think he has even found a favorite tune! Would highly recommend! I would purchase this toy again.
3,great with minor adjustments,"We recieved this off our registry when our daughter turned 3 months. She loves it and so do we. But beware, you have to lay them with the toys at thier legs to able to see the lights and the low volume is really LOUD! We can hear it three rooms away quite loudly. We covered the speakers to mute it a little. It could use a notch lower on the volume control."
4,Great labels but peeling the back off is a pain,This is a great label maker. The labels are bold and do not smear. it is super simple to use. Only complaint is that the backing is difficult to get off the label. I have not been very successful doing it the way the instructions show. Maybe long fingernails would help?
4,Good for Light Label Use,"This works great. However, there are 2 things I don't like about it. 1) too much waste of label before and after printing and these cartridges are not cheap. 2) it always tells me the battery needs to be replaced even with new batteries in it. I just keep using it until it actually dies then replace the batteries.This is great for light labeling. Buy something better for heavy use."
2,"Prints nice labels, battery life is abysmal","While this prints truly nice, sharp labels I would not recommend it because it needs fresh batteries every few labels. At first I thought that it was the batteries, but I've repeatedly tried fresh, new batteries and get a few labels out and it shuts off, needing new batteries.If I do manage to get through the labels that I need at one time, I know that I'll have to replace them before using it the next time. Because of this, I find myself avoiding using it and hand-labeling my files and other things that I would like to use a printed label.I'm giving up and buying one that has an AC adapter."
4,Nifty little device,"This little label printer is terrific - I had trouble getting it to load the tape the first time but once it loaded properly, I was able right away to create four or five labels in a flash. I'd recommend this - great for labeling those Tupperware pantry containers!"
5,Loved it.,"Loved it. Easy to use. Very user friendly. Clear type on the labels. Lots of variety with type, size, borders, fonts, etc. There is a little slot on the side of the machine supposedly to help peel the backing off of the labels that doesnt work but I had no problem peeling the labels with my fingers anyways. No complaints."
4,"Fun To Use, Organizes Your Stuff","Someone gave me a P-Touch Labeler, and now it's indispensable. I use it to label videotapes, mark batteries as ""good"", label my kids' books, put my name on my laptop or camera, anything that needs ID.My only complaint is that I wish I could figure out how to make it center text on two lines. Maybe I need to read the manual closer.Text is crisp and clear. For CDs that I burn, it really beats scribbling on the face with a magic marker.Replacement tape is a bit expensive, so keep the labeler away from little kids. My 3 year old loves to hit ""print"" and wastes a lot of tape that way!"
4,Basic Product! Does what it is supposed to do - nothing more.,Bought this for $10 a few months back. Will be upgrading to a PC compatible model to streamline label creation
4,Works as expected.,This product was purchased as a gift because I already own a higher model Brother labeler. The sale price was right and the product works as expected.
1,AWK! No Power Adapter!,"I bought this P-Touch and also bought the power adapter. I looked all over the power adapter page to see which models it worked with, but couldn't find anything, so I ""hoped"" the adapter and the PT-80 worked together. When I got the PT-80, I found there was no where to plug in the adapter. So, I returned it and ordered the PT-1280 instead. Unfortunately, the PT-1280 didn't have great user comments, so I hope it's okay (haven't gotten it yet), but at least it will work with the adapter I bought. I just can't be bothered with the battery problems."
3,PTouch80,"This is the basic labeler. It has great limitations - no choices of fonts, somewhat difficult to use. Only works with very fresh batteries. I wish I had bought a higher level model!"
2,"good for a while, then nothing","worked great for a few months, then started sucking batteries. every time i pulled it out of the drawer (once a month or so) i'd have to put in a new set of batteries just to get it to print. now it won't print anything, even with fresh batteries (it still feeds the tape through though). so, i'm going to be looking for a new label maker. yay."
2,Shopping for a New Labeler,"As several reviewers have noted, this unit notoriously reports ""low battery"" after just a few uses. This is the case even when using very new ""digital"" batteries.I'm rating this with two stars instead of one because I find the interface is easy to use and functional. If not for the power problem, this would unit would be fine.I would have liked to see an optional AC adapter for this, and would have gladly paid for it. As it is, I'm keeping my eye out for a new labeler."
4,Nifty way to organize,"This is little machine is extremely easy to use. I was organizing seldom-used items in plastic tubs. It was a snap to add a label for each item as I put it in the tub. Choices of colors, fonts, size of print, and the appropriate length for each word or phrase make it an excellent choice. It even turns itself off after a short period of no use, saving battery life. I have large fingers and short fingernails, so it is a bit hard to get the backing off the tape, but other than that, I found it to be marvelous."
4,Great label printer for a great price,"Just bought this a month ago and have used it to label all of my file folders. I remember reading a review where the person complained that it's very hard to peel the backing off of the labels - well, the P-touch has a slot on the top of the unit that you can use to get the backing to peel off a little. Then, you can easily pull it off. I specifically mention this because I almost didn't buy it due to that review. So, don't worry about peeling the backing off of the labels. ;-)"
4,Works Well,"I am not an experienced labeler. However, this labeler has worked great for me so far. I've labeled a bunch of files at work and now they are so much easier to access. This labeler is very handy to have around the office. Expect to go through your first roll of tape very quickly, as you'll be labeling everything in site. Peeling the tape off has not been difficult as some other reviewers have stated. One fault I have found is that the default font is large and I prefer small. I would have also liked an AC adapter, but I still havent had to replace the batteries yet, and I am half way through my second roll of tape. Otherwise this labeler has done everything I have expected it to do; label things."
1,Dead battery after 1 label,"Horrible battery life - dead battery after 1 label. Thought that the batteries were bad, took new battaries, and the same thing happened. So, made 2 labels and wasted 8 battaries. Do not buy."
4,"A great unit for the price, but far from perfect","I got my hands on this unit for $10 during the post-Thanksgiving melee last year. For that price it's stellar. However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers regarding its shortcomings:1) The method of removing the backing is ineffective, taking multiple attempts and often ruining the label.2) There is far too much waste on the ends of the labels. If your text is short, you wind up cutting more of the label away than you use for the text itself. For example, I was labeling the switches for a power center, and needed the small text to read ""HUB"". It spit out almost 2 inches of tape for a label that was less than 3/8"" long when finished. There should be some way to adjust that.3) The Function interface is somewhat counterintuitive. If you don't use it for a while, you have to relearn everything."
2,Eats Batteries - get one with a power cord,"I wanted to reiterate that this thing *EATS* batteries. I thought I could combat this flaw with rechargeable batteries, but in the end it didn't work out. You end up getting stuck with a dead device while you wait for 6 hours for your batteries to recharge (Rechargeable batteries still loose their charge when they are not being used). I'm not saying you can't manage your battery usage and make this device work for you, but I will say that I don't have the time to worry if the batteries in my labeler are up to the task.Eventually I had an engineering buddy solder a power cord to the device so I wouldn't have to worry about the batteries anymore. Yes it's a hack, but it was cheaper than buying another labeler. If you're already looking to buy a $20/30 dollar labeler, I'd recommend getting one with an optional power cord."
4,Functional for home labeling,"This label maker works really well. Here are the pros:1) Can change style of text (bold, shadow etc)2) M tapes are very cheap compared to other Brother series of tapes3) You can print on two lines (so say your name and phone number) but the text is fairly small - good for labeling personal property4) Very easy to use - I never looked at the manualCons:1) Uses a bit of extra tape on the ends2) Only 2 lines max3) Tapes only come in 1/2 and 3/8 inch widths."
2,Not the best,"This item prints out nice lettering, tape is not that sticky. After two short lines it is blinking low battery. I have used this item twice and put in the closet, surely was not worth my money. Son seen one at Walmart and thought we should try that one to see if it is any better and compare them. LOL"
4,Usable general purpose labeler,"The Brother PT-80 is a usable general purpose labeler. It is clearly not designed for heavy duty use. It has no provision for an external power adapter.Ergonomically, it is well designed. Cup it in your palms and you can easily type with your thumbs, easily reaching every key. Lay it on a flat surface and two finger typing is the order of the day.The interface is reasonably intuitive which is good, because the printed instructions aren't overly helpful. A few minutes of experimenting with button functions should bring the user up to speed.One thing many users who skip reading the instruction sheet miss is that there is a little slot on the rear of the unit which can be used to separate the tape from its backing.Overall, this is a pretty nice unit, though it feels insubtantially made - and probably is. Shop carefully and you can find this at truly excellent prices from some vendors who use it as a promotional item. Buy one at that price and you won't be sorry.Jerry"
4,A Couple of Pointers:,"Quick comment on two features:I noticed one reviewer complaining about spending 15 minutes separating the label from the backing. If you read the directions you will find there is a ""device"" on the back of the machine that assists in the separation. It takes about 3-5 seconds to remove the backing.You can adjust the length of each label. I understand that the label must extend out for cutting, but there is a bit of waste on each label.All in all, I like the system. It has a good instruction sheet. Use it."
4,Nice home office labler,I labeled my whole home office & lots of stuff in the garage & just kept on lableing! I didn't find it using too much tape but I was frugal in the lengths of my labels as well. Everyone should have one of these!
1,Unforgivably atrocious battery life,"No matter how excellent many other features of this labeler are, everything is negated by the astonishingly horrible battery life on this product. It goes through batteries like no other product I've ever owned. It's as if they did it on purpose! The fact that it doesn't even have an option for a dc input makes it even worse. I've already spent more on batteries for this thing than I have on the item itself. Junk."
2,Surprisingly difficult to use and expensive,"Most significantly, it doesn't save much time when it takes 15-20 seconds just to peel the backing off every single label! I thought date-stamping some food would be a good idea, but I just grab a pen now.I couldn't get it to print, at first, and read the manual completely trying to figure out the problem. It turns out the back of the printer has to in place before it will print. Clever, but it would have been nice to include that in the trouble-shooting section!I had to read the manual to figure out how to get it to feed labels--it just shouldn't be that difficult to use.I've used it to print maybe a dozen labels in 3 weeks and the batteries are already shot! That just seems ridiculous to me.In reality, it seems this printer will be a lot more expensive to use than I ever expected."
1,Don't Buy This Junk,"This is the most annoying piece of junk I have bought in ages. The instructions tell you to feed the tape before use. What they don't say is you have to type up a label before the feed button will work. I took the first one back because I thought it was defective. Once I figured this out on the second one I printed some labels. The big problem is peeling the backing off the labels. There is a peeler slot on the thing but pictures in the instructions are so small and bad they are useless, and following the text instructions doesn't work. Peeling off the backing by hand requires the patience of a saint and the dexterity of a fly tying fly fisherman. Its OK if you just want to label your stereo, but if you need to label a few hundred files this thing is a joke. You will have to spend hours coaxing the backing off the label tape."
5,Big quality in compact size,I use a large label maker at work everyday and wanted one for home. I have been very pleased with this label maker...works just like the big one and even has more function options!
1,"Eats batteries, otherwise good","I have no complaints about the product itself. It is easy to use and does a good job making the labels I want to make with the right customization. However, it is a battery vampire. I have had it for five years now and no matter how recently I've bought the batteries, it blasts right through them. This most recent time I had bought fresh batteries from the store (4 AAA) and put them in, and before I finished typing the name of the first label, the battery indicator started flashing that it was time to replace the batteries. There is no A/C option, so there's no way to mitigate the damage this little wonder will do to your supply of AAA's. Based on the extreme battery consumption I would not recommend this model to anyone, and am finally throwing in the towel and getting another brand."
1,"Drains batteries, no option for AC adapter","Why it needs to store date, time, etc is beyond me.Every time I take mine out, I need new batteries.There is no option to use an AC adapter to alleviate this issue. So, long-term this unit will be expensive to maintain, or be unreliable since battery status can't be trusted."
3,Labels curl off of notebooks,"I like the labeler itself, for ease of use, however, I am using the labels on vinyl notebooks to organize my DVD collection and they curl up and do not stick, as they do on file folders.I purchased the new Brother P-Touch TZe label which is currently being advertised on television as indoor/outdoor use, compatible with P-touch Labelers. Needless to say, the cartridges were MUCH too large for the PT-80 machine I have. Now it seems I must use adhesive tape over the old labels to keep them on the notebooks, rather than use a more adhesive label. Is there no TZe label out there that is compatible with the PT-80 labeler? Because this is NOT what I was looking for!"
3,Mixed Review,"I've had this labeler since 2008. There are many good things about it. Inserting and changing the tape is easy so one can use different colors for each year. However, the tape is expensive - Staples is now charging $22 a roll. The worst thing about the label maker is removing the backing from the tape so you can attach it to a file. You insert it into a slot and pull it out. It doesn't work very well. Sometimes nothing happens. Sometimes, the tape is torn. Perhaps others are more adept than I am at this. Most of the time I have to use tweezers to get the backing off."
4,Great Basic Labeler,"I think this labeler is excellent except for the repeated complaint of the length of lead tape before and after the label. To those complaining about peeling off the backing, I suggest reading the manual about the slot used to remove the backing - it's very handy. I also really liked the easy-open blister packaging - no need for a box cutter!"
2,Save your money,"I will give the product two stars since it does what it supposed to do.pros: cheap, light, compactCons (few, but significant):* Labels have about 1"" dead white area before and after the text.* Batteries will die quickly even if unused (I had to replace 4 AAA every time i needed some small label)."
2,Battery Issue,"I see now that other people have had this same issue. $29 is a good price until you have to figure in $5 every other month for batteries. I use the PT-80 to make 5-10 labels a month and I continue to get the battery message. The PT-80 actually stops printing and feeding even though the measured voltage on the 1.5vdc batteries is 1.52-1.54vdc. Brand new batteries, they measure 1.59vdc, still get the battery message after printing 5 tapes."
1,Battery Killer,I've used this label maker for about 2 years now. During that time I produced about 30-40 labels and have had to replace the batteries (4 AAA) seven times. It seems to draw on the batteries even when it's off. I've had enough of Brother products.
3,Battery consumptions is a deal breaker,"Nice little label printer, but battery consumption is simply unacceptable. I add brand new batteries and cannot even complete using a roll of tape before needing to replace them. Sometimes within an hour of labeling for a project. There is also no a/c option, so you can't plug it in. If I could plug this in to use it, I'd give it a 4 star rating. This product is just too expensive to operate. I'll be buying a different one that I can plug in. Bummer."
4,Labeler,"This machine is great. It's somewhat addictive to go and label things. Like other reviews, I would agree that this device uses a lot of battery overall. There are a lot of options for printing, from wide/tall, single/double lines, and multiple fonts. It's very versatile."
4,Does what it says it does.,"This is a handy little machine that makes labels. Nothing more, nothing less. It does like to waste tape, like all label makers (why do they always print out a quarter inch behind the text?). Its a little battery intensive. If you need to make a few labels around the house this is for you. If you need a machine for an industrial or office setting I would probablly go elsewhere."
1,Economical price but lack operability,"I bought this due to its affordable and economical price. However, few impractical features of the product makes me regretted for going cheap. Should have pay more for a higher end product. The batteries run out very fast. In this case, I would think the manufacturer should at least offer a AC input. Only the M type label can be used for this model and it has only paper type material. Disappointed though printing is quite fast."
5,Brother PT-80 P-touch Electronic Labeler,The item was delivered in new condition and we are very satisfied with the vendor.
4,Nice label maker,"I like this label maker. I also have a previous model, the PT-65.Pros of PT-80:1. QWERTY keyboard2. Uses 4 AAA batteries instead of 6 AA batteries (like the PT-65 uses).Cons:1. Expensive label tape, may be hard to find2. The amount of blank tape at each end of the label seems a bit wasteful and excessive.3. Comes with shorter ""starter"" cartridge - MK-231S instead of MK-231.I think I will like my new PT-80 even more than the PT-65."
1,RIDICULOUSLY LOW BATTERY LIFE,"This is an absolutely horrible device. It only runs on batteries, and I'm only able to print 6 (<--- SIX!!!!) labels before the batteries die. Brother should be brought up on war crimes for this horrendous machine."
5,GREAT LABELER!!!!,This little thing has done a great job helping me get organized!!!!Tapes come in a multitude of color options.Works well and prints NICELY!!Borrowed one from a friend and had to buy my own!!!
2,Brother PT-80,"This label maker was great until I ran out of tape. I went through 3 cartridges of labels(tape) very quickly. Brother really gets you because there is a lot of space in front of your text as well as after your text. I sold mine and am looking for one that does not waste a lot of tape. For now, I'll stick to computer printouts. $10 is too much for only a few labels."
5,Love it!,I have been labeling everything! It's easy to use and I love it. Ordering the replacement tape is a little bit of an ordeal though. The one I wanted I had to google it to find a place that didn't charge so much for delivery.
3,Can be fixed to use batteries correctly,"I bought this item several months ago and promptly packed it away when I found out that you could only print 1 or 2 labels before replacing the batteries. I figured I had just received a bad one.Recently we used one that we found unopened at work. I printed one very short label using brand new batteries and the battery died. I figured I'd need to forget about this one too. Fortunately, the man who repairs our transports came in and noticed the label maker. He inquired about it and I explained what had happened. He went and got a pencil (he used the eraser) and did something to the batteries and the label maker. The batteries work again and haven't died since. I wish I knew exactly what he did.I originally would have rated this item a 1 but now give it a 5. Hence I averaged the total and gave it a 3 here."
4,Does what it is supposed to do,"I purchased this little gem through, (this is the proper spelling, not thru), lightning deals, and was very excited about getting this. I have managed to label everything including my kids. Seems like the labels are pretty kid resistant. I am a big kid at heart, so I had to label everything. Even my wife didn't escape!!! I would recommend this product to anyone looking for it. Still, I don't understand why a label maker would need some sort of border option, yet, it does make it fun! Anyhow, get this one of you need one. I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'."
1,Poor quality,"For the price, I wasn't expecting a top of the line labeler. BUT, I also did not expect the product to break after 2 uses! Maybe I just got a defective one, but let me tell you, mine broke.Maybe you do get what you pay for."
1,Disappointed with a captial 'D',"1st i read all the reviews which HELPED me purhcase this product with extra cartridge, they were a great help mind you.2nd when i received the labeller and startyed to print i finished a cartridge in a day, seriously.3rd after using it and putting the labels every - main reason to purchase was to place labels on my daughters baby bottles, to find out - very disappointed that the labels cannot be WET - i taught it was the heat from the hot water after sterlizing the bottles but it was the water on the hold... which makes you waste money (which they are not cheap) for labels for the bottles - I AM NOT PLEASED at allllllllll!I know it has to be this type of label paper used because the labels i GOT before from another labeller - brand not told here - works fine.. not horrors no worries no extra spending - what a waste... after alll.. do not let the comments fool you.. i hope mine has helped..."
1,Battery Life - Non-existent,"From the Brother website...""Although the machine is not being used often, the Time and Date function requires power from the batteries continually to keep the Time and Date up to date. Therefore, by using the time and date function this will decrease the battery Life. If you use the machine only once a week and don't require the Time and Date function, you can remove the batteries from the machine to increase the battery life.""In essence, if you want your batteries to survive at all you should remove them after every use. I went to their FAQs after the third set of batteries lasted only a few labels. I would receive the ""BATTERY"" warning when trying to print and it was nearly impossible to complete label.I expect a label maker to be like any other office appliance - easy, convenient, and reasonably reliable. It's not easy or convenient if I have to constantly remove and replace batteries. I'm highly disappointed."
3,Basic label printing,"This label printer has a fisher-price feel to it, and is a bit large for the basic electronics inside. That is ok because it helps make the typing easier and the lime green makes for a cute combination. However the labels have large margins (to make you buy more tape) and this uses the direct thermal printing method which is not as durable over time, and has limited choice of tape styles/materials. I ended up returning this one for the Brother PT-2700 which uses thermal transfer for a much larger variety of tape cartridges, as well as an auto-cutter. Nevertheless this is ok as a no-frills model."
1,Persistent battery problems,"I bought this unit and always have battery problems. Even with fresh batteries, it doesn't last long. In addition, this unit doesn't have a power adapter plug, so you must rely on batteries. I have rechargeable AAA batteries, and even these don't work even though fully charged. It prints partially before completely shutting down. This is poor design and I'm not the only person encountering this problem it seems. Overall, it's an absolutely horrible device. The next one I'm getting will support a power adapter. You should look for that option too. Avoid this unit at all cost."
4,Hard to go wrong for $10,"At $10 delivered with Amazon prime, how can you go wrong? Answer: two ways - battery issues - this thing is power hungry. I put brand new fresh batteries in it, powered it on, and the first thing I saw on the LCD was ""BATTERY"" - argh! Powered it off, then back on, and no more battery message - it was fine, the power system on this thing is a little flaky. Wasted tape - there is a good bit of extra tape on each side of the printed label, so there is some waste. I gave it four stars overall, but actually it is a five star device for my usage. I just wanted something cheap to print about 50 labels for a small project, and was not willing to pay the $30 or much more for most labelers. For that purpose, it was very cheap and did exactly what I wanted it to do. If you need to print a large number of labels (200+) I would look elsewhere, but for what I wanted to do with it, this device was by far the least expensive option, and it worked great for me."
3,Quick tip to keep it from being a piece of junk,"The other reviews complaining about battery life are correct. The problem is bad enough to make me want to throw it out and buy a different product. I only need to label something now and then, and every time I tried to use it, it had drained the batteries, even though I had turned it off. Using fresh rechargeable don't help me either; it can barely print a single label when using rechargeables.But it's usable as long as you're willing to remove one of the batteries once you're done. There's a depression by the battery compartment you can lay the battery in, allowing you to snap the case back on. When you need to use it, put the battery back in, power on, press Enter a bunch of times to get through the settings (which you won't need anyway), and then you're ready. Ridiculous, yes, but other than that it's a decent, affordable label maker."
3,Average buy,"Not as you can imagine your better of sticking with the subscriptions, it would have been nice to have more information in chapter forms and related to the type of category your dealing with, but overall just general information which most common sense tells us.Future releases of this book should think about integrating a cdrom with knot tying techniques as well as trolling techniques maybe live baiting and casting nets, If only there was a bible on this subject like most computer books have, it would be a good reference point.Check it out before you buy it."
1,It is not what It seems...,"The cap is not the material made that You see in the image. It is an ordinary ""black"" cap. I bought two and both came with a little crack inside. Bad quality."
5,maxcondition,"Maxcondition is an absolute must have for any athlete, coach, or fitness enthusiast. Hale is second to none in his ability to convey scientific complexity in a simple straight forward manner. If you are trying to get to the next level in your respective sport, or are simply interested in improving your general health, either way Maxcondition is the one book that you can't afford not to read."
2,Thick Junk,"I have been in the insurance industry 15 years and just decided to buy this as an addition for my work desk. I rarely open the book, however, anytime I go to look up a coverage definition it is not listed. This book is of NO use to me. Not really sure who would use this.............a person who hands out maps at the Auto Club who may need to look up a word or two?"
1,Not worth the money; filled with non-insurance-related terms,"A better name for this product would be the Long-Winded Financial Terms Dictionary. Its pages are filled with non-insurance-related definitions for accounting, legal, and other financial-service terms. Worse yet, several key insurance-related terms that have come into existence in, say, the past century are not included. The only thing I have ever used this book for is to cite the author's claim that U.S. citizens spend more money on insurance than any other type of expenditure - but that occurs in the preface. The terms themselves are unhelpful and incomplete, and the book's pages are stuffed with filler."
1,"Good product - just what I wanted, but.....","Lipton's Blackberry tea has been discontinued. My wife uses this flavor in her ice tea mix, so I went looking for some. Good Ole Amazon had a source for it.My only complaint is the merchant had it priced about double the normal retail price. But, I ordered it anyway. I complained about the price and was offered a return & full refund. I was not offered any price adjustment.I would caution anyone ordering from this merchant to shop carefully before buying from them. This is NOT about Amazon, but the merchant that provides products through them."
5,An old favorite,I used to get this in a store near me then it became unavailable. I was very happy to find it here .
1,Unhappy with price,"I love this tea, but with the recent huge price increase, I may have to find another option. I bought in July, and it was in the $30 price range. In September, it was in the high$40 range!!"
1,No Blackberry flavor and Weak tea flavor,"This is a very disappointing tea. There was a slight aroma of berry, not necessarily blackberry, and NO flavor of any berry. The actual tea was very weak and bland. I like blackberry flavor that has that wonderful luscious jammy blackberry flavor. This tea has none of that, merely a light scent of generic berry. I would not recommend this tea to anyone who wants a rich flavorful blackberry tea or any tea for that matter."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this item for a number of reasons. It's one of the poorest Star Wars genre stories I've listened to. Readings typically add a lot to the stories in my opinion, but this one made a poor story even worse. To be fair, I didn't listen to the entire CD; I just lost interest too thoroughly to continue."
1,Were they going for funny?,"I couldn't believe how bad this was. It was almost like they got a cast to do a parody. In fact, about 20 minutes into it I realized it sounded exactly like a South Park episode - with the boys in hats doing a Star Wars skit for their school play. After that I found it amusing - but not enough to finish. Is this series of books for tweens or something? Did I miss that part?"
2,good art,"this features the best looking art in the tales of the jedi dark horse books, but like the others the story isn't really that great. blah"
1,LIghts don't meet my expectations,"My kitchen needs 85 watt floodlights to give adequate lighting. Due to the environmentalist crackdown on our comfort and eyesight, I can only get 65 watts at my local hardware outlets. I tried these supposed 85 watt lights, but they are no brighter than the 65 watts you can still get locally. Don't waste your money - it's a ripoff. They are not really 85 watts, at least in light output."
1,not as bright as it should be,"I bought 24 120W bulb from an online store. they are so dim, just about 65W bulb. I called Havells and complained. They told me to go back to the seller to return. If my seller does not accept return, I can call Havells again and they will help me.So , do not keep them, return the bulbs! I did."
1,carnival of venice,"My disappointment is not with the artist or the music, but the excessive brevity of the Carnival of Venice. I must agree that the description of the CD states that the Carnival of Venice was abridged but it was much too severe. Too much of the more exciting and challenging portions of the music were left out."
3,"Ah, so-so for these pieces","After my professors were raving about this particular cd, I had purchased it only to wonder if anyone else notices her airy tone? It drove me crazy. I also don't care for her vibrato.I did think the best tracks were performances of Godard. The Gaubert pieces were also worth listening to more than once. The Genin version of 'Carnival' was terrible. Find the Briccaldi version and give it to Mark Sparks or Sir James Galway but please skip Robison's attempt!I'm sure if I were to pick up other Paula Robison cds, I might enjoy her fluffy approach to playing. That sound is appropriate for french repertoire but the cd left me wanting a do-over."
2,Not for beginners,"I got this book from the library because I wanted to start learning Algebra. The first half I managed to do without getting totally lost, but as I approached the other half, the author worked out equations without even bothering to explain how she reached the answer. Especially the geometry part, which is super frustrating.Why call it Algebra for dummies when it's clearly NOT for beginners. Geez.And the so called humor in the book takes the place of equation explanation!! So if you don't understand the first explanation then too bad for you, you're getting a childish joke instead. :/But I still learned from the first half, credit for that."
1,"Algebra for, of and by dummies.",I think the 'dummies franchise is doomed if they permit this kind of product to leave their publisher. The author befuddles the reader and obfuscates the subject. My high school algebra was never this confusing. Our country lags much of the world because of teachings like this.Teaching requires empathy and there's little in this book.
2,Not for Dummies,"Now if I were a dummy, and in many ways I am, I would be furious with this book. It doesn't mention until page 4 that the author assumes you've already had a year of algebra. What if I hadn't? What if I was picking up this book because I wanted to learn algebra from scratch? Most anyone would naturally assume that's what this book is for. But right away you'd be lost. Even the ""fun facts"" would make me heave this thing out the window. Info about ""three-term quadratic equations"" is a fun fact? Not if you're a compleat dummy and you haven't the foggiest what this woman is talking about. The 2 stars are generous. It's not too bad for an overview of something you already know and merely want to to remember. Thank my stars I do know algebra, but damn...dummies beware."
2,Not for use if you are starting from the beginning...,Definitely not a book for someone going back to the beginning after a long lapse in math instruction. Book assumes prior knowledge/memory of various algebraic concepts and therefore does not provide information from a foundation upon which to build a full understanding of subject matter. An actual algebraic workbook is more informative.
2,Not for me,I really hate to rate this book this low but if you are someone who really struggles with Algebra in all honesty I feel that this book would not be for you. I guess I expected more details and problems to work with but not so. I will be looking for something else!!!!!
2,an algebra refresher . . .,"If you had taken algebra a few years ago and need a refresher for your GED or ASVAB, this book will be fine.If you have never taken algebra, or like me, took it 20 years ago and have forgotten most or all of it, this book is almost useless.at best you get a short paragraph on the theory of the problem to solve, then you get the answer. very seldom do you get a breakdown of the indvidual steps that took you from problem to conclusion. this is the first ""Dummies"" book which I have ever thrown across a room."
3,not totally useless,"This book does have problems, the lack of exercises being a major one, but it isn't totally useless. It does explain some fundamentals of algebra in very easy to understand language and contains simple examples. I found this good for getting the basics down. I started with ""Algebra The Easy Way"", but found that it would give simple examples and overly difficult exercises, which only succeeded in frustrating me.I would suggest Algebra for Dummies as an absolute beginners book which should be used along with a slightly more advanced text with exercises. One can always make up his/her own exercises as well.Remember, this is a ""Dummies"" book. How much can you really expect?"
2,A Lot of Text for a Little Mastery,"Even though there are a lot of pages in this book, the number of concepts covered is extremely small. This would be better titled ""Pre-Algebra for Dummies""; in fact, you'd be hard pressed to pass an Algebra I class with the material covered in this text. While it is friendly, there are other friendly books that cover a wider breadth of material. I cannot recommend this book."
1,dumber now,This book gives no opportunity to practice what your reading. Some important things arn't explained well. Can't learn Algebra without doing it. Book is useless.
4,Algebra for Dummies,This book has been very helpful to me. I do not have the best math book in the world and this book explains terms in easy to understand phrases. I would recommend this book to anyone who struggles in math.
4,Algebra for Dummies,"I was forced into taking Algebra as one of the requirements for my Associates. I had never taken Algebra before and was a little nervous about taking it. My professor suggested this book so I would have a reference that spoke in plain english. It was helpful in understanding some of the verbage of algebra. I got through with a ""B"" and consider myself extremely lucky. I recommend this book for beginners or just someone who needs to brush up on the basics of algebra."
2,Test your water with chlorine test strips to see that it doesn't work!,"Although the rain shower filter looks great, it does very little to remove chlorine. I bought a new filter and used EPA-certified free chlorine test strips (the kind used in commercial kitchens to meet health department codes) to test the amount of chlorine this filter removed. There was no difference between untreated tap water and supposed filtered water from this unit. Water from my Brita pitcher filter by comparison tested negative for chlorine. After doing more research online, I've found that many shower filters are ineffective despite claims, mainly because of water temperature and pressure that doesn't allow the water to slowly filter through the chamber like a water pitcher filter does. I'm still looking for a better filter(will check out Vitamin C shower filters next), but this product is really just an expensive and sharp looking shower head."
5,Better than expected,One can immediately feel the difference in the water:You can fell taste and smell the difference in the water you are showering with.Skin and hair feel soft and smooth. Buying another one for my other bathroom.
1,Caution: not a good choice for the S105!,"This leather case is promoted as fitting the Samsung S105 phone, but the cutout in the vinyl cover for the microphone is on the right side, while the microphone on the S105 is on the left. I had to use a knife to make a cutout in the proper place, which inelegantly solved that problem. Another problem occurs, however, with how the glove on the ""flipper"" is attached to the body of the case: with a very strong elastic which prevents the flipper from closing firmly--it doesn't take much of a jar for the flipper to extend, all on its own.This case may be adequate for the A460, but it is not appropriate for the S105."
4,Perfect Fit But !,"Excellent quality leather case. fits like a glove, but the hole over where you speak into on the phone is covered. They punched the hole on the wrong side. Not a big deal, just get one of those hand paper hole punchers and re-punch the hole. Thats what I did to correct the problem.I highly recommend this case over the aftermarket brands."
5,Samsung Leather Case,"I am pleased with this leather case. It has holes in all the right places, including the microphone hole on the right side (unlike one of the previous postings & picture indicates - don't know if the posting was a fluke posting or not). I can't tell if the leather is immatation or not; but it is nice looking to me. The belt clip has a locking mechanism in which you have to press a little button to release. The belt clip may or may not not be wide enough for really wide belts. The price is the best price I found anywhere, including the manuafacturer's website."
1,Useless without the special tool,"Not clamshell, not at all. The product says it's best when used with the special cut off tool, but it's just not useable at all without it. Would not have ordered these if I knew I'd have to spend another $60+ for the tool."
5,"Wow...a MAJOR time saver, headache reducer, and makes me look good too!","I got a pack of these because I ran into a job where whoever dropped the cables before did the typical ""bad wiring job"" with the ends leaving a half inch of unsheathed CAT5e cable...at least they got the specification right...Anyway, snip, rip, set, crimp all in less than 30 seconds!These are so nice, totally worth the price premium. They have an open end that the cables can go through to let you get a tight fit on the cable, and allow you to arrange the pairs with no problems. The open slot is also grooved to hold the cable in line as high quality standard connectors have.I also purchasedPlatinum Tools EZ-RJPRO HD Crimp Toolalong with these, which has a flush cut cutter on the crimp end to cut off the extra wire that is poking through.Finally, these standard bootsRJ45 Blue Strain Relief Boots (50 Pcs Per Bag)here work perfectly fine. Nice and snug, and cover the clip fine."
4,Works without the trimming crimp tool,Recommended. And they work fine *without* the EZ RJ45 crimp tool. Just trim the loose wires right up against the end with a utility knife. Then the connector will slide all the way into the slot. Or you can pull the wires back a bit before crimping. Either way works.
2,The Boys of Summer it ain't,"Too short and nothing new. Anyone interested enough in the Dodgers to purchase this book probably already knows everything the book has to say. You get a short history of the Dodgers, a synopsis of the '55 season and a play by play of the Series. A good third of the book, at least the Kindle edition, is taken up by an appendix giving a game by game rehash of the 1955 season in table form. This after devoting several chapters to the same topic. Of all the statistics, box scores and Jamesian analysis of baseball I've ever seen, this table is among the most useless."
5,What a GREAT book!!!,"i read this book cover to cover and it just arrived yesterday.i could not put it down. being to young to actualy have any rememberance of the acual event, this book takes you and puts you there, giving you a great feeling of what it must have been like, for the fans & the players. i have read bums, boys of summer, the last good season & this book here. they are all great and i would have to give this book 5 stars..it is a little on the expensive side now that it is out of print and in such high demand but it is definitley worth every penny.i have added this to my collection and it is a perfect complement to my magazine ""who's a bum"" the 40th anniversary of the 1955 brooklyn dodgers""..you get that magazine and this book and you got it all!! BUY IT IF YOU CAN!!!!"
1,"Learned My Lesson to read ""samples"" before buying!",Yuck!It took less then ten minutes and paging through 16% of this book to realize I had gotten a real loser! Dry... boring...disappointing!And this was a book I PAID for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thank goodness it was only $2.99 but was overpriced at that!
3,Hunters Bride Love Inspired # 172,"I you haven't gotten in on the love inspired let me tell you they are good, although just a little focused around church, they aren't too preachy.In this book Chloe Caldwell told a lie about her boss Luke Hunter that got out of hand. Her grandmother blew her lie all to pieces by writing to Hunter. And so begins a romance.I still prefer Susan Fox, Jessica Steele, Helen Brooks, Betty Neels, Essie Summers, Rebecca Winters, Eva Rutland, and Diana Palmer."
4,It makes sence,"You know this book or shall I say, James Allen makes alot of sence. It makes you realize that life is just as you make it!"
4,What a Debut,"The newest member from the Suburban Noize Clique has dropped his debut album, and what a new pleasant surprise. The Dirtball is a breath of fresh air to the rap and hip-hop world, making some music that is actually different. His voice makes for a unique and quick flow that really can't be matched. If your down with the krown and you love the sub noize army you will definitely love the dirtball, he keeps it real and his lyrics tell stories. Check out ""Bulldoggin"", ""We Bad"", ""Love Life"", ""Ppppimp""."
1,Need to be wider,"These feet won't last long on a Macbook Pro, there is a recessed area for the OEM feet, these Pawz give you just a tiny bit of surface to stick them to around that recessed foot area, so they will only last a few weeks or months at best. If they were just a little wider to stick to more surface, they likely would last longer. If they were simply wider I would give 5 stars."
3,Worth playing,"While definitly not as uniqely triumphent as it's predecessor, part 2 continues the specific humor and gameplay only to be found throughout the monkey island experience..Extremely dated dos based game is not for newbies to the series though, i recommend starting with part 3, at least those graphics still retain some sense of style after all this time!"
1,Written by academics for academics,"I have to admit I am thoroughly dissappointed by this book and cannot understand the positive reviews it received from several of the other readers, except that they may be academics. If you are somebody who is only interested in the theory and philosophical background of corporate partnerships, this might be the book you are looking for, but if you are, like myself, a practical doer, who is looking for hands-on insight and knowledge on this topic, you will be deeply dissappointed. Also several of the examples of ""showcase"" alliances, such as Iridium, are not only outdated, but in fact, bankrupt. Very annoying to read about these ""great"" alliances, that several months after publishing went belly up. To sum it up, for the practical business professionals among you, I suggest you keep on researching on other books in this genre. Unfortunately, since I didn't read yet any other books on this topic, I cannot offer an alternative book advice."
3,Not as good as expected,I ordered this unit based on the reviews and what people at the stores told me. I have owned 3 radar detectors in my life and this one falses the most. The worst part is that most falses are on Ka band and after a short time you don't know if you should slow down or not. It does have good range but what good is it if you can't trust it! the voice sounds like a 70's robot and the volume control is very poor. You can do better
5,nice set of wrenches,Bought this set of box end wrenches for work...industrial maintenance/hvac work....millwright.Wanted an inexpensive set of box ends for my maintenance bag...something that could be abused...lost...stolen and not break my back....I use SK tools but dont really need those expensive wrenches and sockets at work....Its a nice set....fully polished....held up good during some testing tonight with a great neck socket set I just bought...well worth the money in my opinion.3.00 or so a wrench...fully polished....if they hold up as well as they look its a great deal.I never knew great neck made wrenches etc....I know there other tools are of decent quality so I believe these will hold up also.
5,YA NO PERMITAS QUE TE LAVEN EL CEREBRO Y,"TE ANGUSTIEN !EL ESTRES NOS MANTIENE VIVOS, SANOS Y EXITOSOS !De verdad, amigo..EL QUE SE MURIÓ FUE MI CARDIOLOGO ( Más joven que yo: Tenía 35 años ) Y MIRA QUE LUCHABA POR NO ESTAR ESTRESADO...NO FUMABA, NO BEBÍA ! Y SE ESPONJÓ DE UN INFARTO !ESTRÉSATE, VIVE EN PLENITUD Y TRIUNFA, MI CUATE !"
5,Good Resource,I got this to assist with Advent planning. It has good information to be incorporated into worship. Anything from John Bell is quite remarkable.
3,The one you get is not the one pictured!,"This is a tough one, the product works great, but the seller has the wrong picture posted and the item you receive is not the one pictured.When I opened the package, I was surprised to see that the Bow stringer sent to me was not the bow stringer in the picture. The Bow stringer in the picture is actually a different model, the Neet 2267 recurve bow stringer. The one that you will receive is the Neet 74870, so if you are seeking the recurve bow stringer DO NOT ORDER THIS ONE. It may or may not work with your recurve. We got lucky that this will work with ours and we have plans for a traditional long bow in the future. Be careful, the picture is misleading."
4,Bow Stringer,Product shipped quickly and was exactly what I ordered. No instructions on how to adjust and I had to add cotton into one end to get it to work correctly.
2,Sailing and Racing Through Paradise Don't Mix,"I read this book several years ago following a fine read of WFB's Atlantic High. There is no comparison. From the get-go, the pace is set by an unrealistic schedule to get to the other side of the Pacific so an important passenger (ambassador or similar rank) can attend some soire in Europe. The opportunity to read and learn about any indepth interaction between the elements, or the Pacific Islanders, is lacking. I can weather WFB's verbosity, but there has to be some meat...to go along with the large wine cellar he packs aboard. I would enjoy crewing with WFB, even keeping a journal, but racing through paradise - no thanks. Read Atlantic High and call it a good sail."
5,thoughtful,an interesting insight in to the personal life of such a public icon - wouldn't any of us just loved to have been part of this - but I don't know if my liver would survive!
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Although Buckley crafts his story well, this book serves only as a platform for him to express his inflated self importance. It is uninteresting and useless as a sailing narrative. The only reason I continued to read was in expectance of a point. Don't make the same mistake."
5,Excellent; Entertaining; and very Informative,"This book is easy to read, and fascinating. The author backs up the old timers stories with facts and adds to the history where appropriate. I found this book to be extremely interesting."
1,DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS MAN,This man is a fraud! I read this book and was so hoping it was what he claimed. I flew down and spent 2 days with this man waiting for something to happen. The only thing that happened was I felt violated and it cost a lot of money. I found out later that this man (directly from him no less) has been arrested and has had several law suits filed against him. Don't waste your time and money on this lunatic.
2,Be cautious,I read this book and was very hopeful that Dr. Martin would be able to help me with my health problems. I flew out to see him and spent 6 hours at his home in session. I did not experience any change or improvement. Please just be cautious and thoroughly think through any decision to spend time and money on a session with him. It may or may not work.
5,Truth as it is !,"This book enligthened me about the issues regarding realtionships between food/diet and health. It simply states what we know, what we do not know about food and health. It clarifies issues regarding foods, health, diet, diseases etc, by just simply discussing the evidence from original research. Every chapter start with a very nice and funny introduction, I honestly laughed a lot.What evidence do we have for widespread unscientific loads of information. It goes on details of some the myths, imagined truths, about war on cholesterol, war on fat, organic, etc. If you want to know what are these all about and get the bottom of it from J. Allread, a well respected expert in human nutrition, this book is a tereasure for you to uncover."
3,Peppermill,"The peppermill is very good. Problem is, it was advertised as 8"" tall. It is, but not including the stainless steel knob on top. After I filled it (and I consider it used now) I found it didn't fit in the space intended which was only a little more than 8"".!! Otherwise, the product works very well."
4,The Lightning Incident,"This movie was great, it was about a woman who's baby was stolen by and her great depths to try and save her baby before it's too late. Starring Nancy McKeon, who plays an excellent role. I absolutely loved this film."
1,Cheaply and Poorly made,"What a disappointment! Braun made good products in Germany, but have outsourced to China and are living on their reputation. Seiko seems to have gone the same route. When they were making clocks and watches in Japan the quality was good... But this is a disgrace! Shame on you Seiko - you are trading on your once-good name. This clock is made of cheap plastic and poorly assembled. It should sell for about $3.00 in a flea market. I have returned mine and will never by a Seiko product again. Don't waste you time on this one. The one-star reviews are correct."
1,Quality Issues,"Purchased one based upon aesthetics and prior reviews. When I received it I followed directions for activation, ie pull plastic tab off battery and replaced same in unit. Nothing happened, the unit didn't work! I called and was sent a second unit with the same results. For me two strikes and Seiko was out."
2,Seiko QUH301FRH travel alarm clock ($37.50 at Amazon),"I should have heeded a number of reviews already written on this travel clock.It's plastic; it's not easy to open;and most disappointing of all, it did not glow.The only luminous parts were tiny slivers of luminous paint on the two hands and tiny dots of same at each of the 12 numbers on the face.It's quite useless from that standpoint. It did run, however, with a Panasonic CR 2025 battery."
2,Not worth the money,"Although this is an attractive looking alarm, it is impossible to see in the dark. The hands are supposed to be luminous, but are not. It is very lightweight which is desirable, but made of plastic, not metal. Setting the clock is not easily done, but setting the alarm is. However, you cannot set it for am or pm. I was impressed with the 8 yr battery life, but if I can't see what time it is without turning on a lamp, I don't want it and am returning it."
2,Its not what I expected,"For $30 i was expecting a metal/glass product. What I received was all plastic which felt very fragile. the front alarm setting is cool, but the hands are only lightly visible at night, the numbers cant be seen and there is no back light. The alarm doesn't start softly then get louder like my old alarm -- it blares. I'll regift it and get something else."
2,Very poor,"As another buyer stated, it seems like an excuse for Elenco to get rid of unused parts. You could build some small things with it, but the majority of parts included are useless. The pamphlet included is probably one of the more useful thing included. Total of 43 parts?NO transformer, no solder.11 resistors (10 carbon film and one variable)7 Simiconductors (3 transistors, 2 diodes - including one LED, and one IC-nothing useful)1 inductor (only 6 coils)10 screws (WHY?!)1 nut (the kind that goes on a bolt)1 tension releiver (for a cord)1 wire nut (Again, WHY?!)2 fillers (plasic cylinder pieces)1 headphone jack1 two-position switch6 Capacitors1 Printer circuit board (has no possible relation to the parts included)Total 43????? Not 50..."
4,A little bit of everything,"This is a pretty nice selection of components. You get a little bit of everything and it even comes with a little booklet explaining the background of each component and how they work. It's geared towards kids, and kind of set up like a science lab. The booklet has ideas for experiments, but there's really not enough in the kit to do much by itself. But if you already have a breadboard and a couple of batteries you could have a lot of fun with the components in this kit."
3,moe`s bar,"hello.My name is William Lawrence and I`m 10 years old.Even though I am writing this review,I havn`t had a chance to play with because I spent all my money with other things.I still think its pretty cool.It`s got a Duffman toy to go along with it and I`ve been waiting for a Duffman toy for a long time.It`s also as a bar tabble for the toys to wet their whistle."
1,are you kidding?!?,"Really, are you people thinking? Here we have a bar geared toward 8 year olds. Complete with, as one other astute reviewer noted, a sign reading ""for a good time, call Edna"". Yeah, I'm gonna hurry and buy this for my child. It'll be under the tree right beside the bottle of Jack Daniels and the Girls Gone Wild video. Good grief."
1,The Worst Toy Idea Ever!,"When I first came across this offering I thought it was a joke. What kind of person would promote this product--certainly not a parent trying to raise a responsible and thoughtful child.I have an idea--how about a drunk tank to put li'l Homer in after his DUI conviction, or maybe an emergency room for when he blacks out and crashes his car!"
3,Nice for the out of box collector,"I bought the item since the prices are pretty good and to work on completeing my collection. All of my WoS Simpsons stuff is either MIMB or MOMC, so I was pretty happy to find this stuff for sale from a shop. I will say, though, the boxes are in pretty rough shape. The items inside are fine, perfect even, but the boxes have crushed corners and the figure's cards can be bent, creased, or folded. The sounds still work well, the paint and contents are not faded or dusty, and the pieces are as interesting as ever, but...If you want the items out of box, you should be fine. If you are collecting the total piece, I'm not sure I would recommend Amazon."
1,This game sucks,"I just bought High Heat Baseball for my PC. With baited breath I waited for this game. It was going to be great, and why not, I have HHB 2001 and it was the best game I've ever played, so why shouldn't the newer version be just as good? Now I am stuck with this piece of junk. What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I have been trying to play season mode, everytime I play a game I get kicked back to my decktop. I have been unable to complete one fricking game. I get close to compleation and I get kicked back to my desktop. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Save your money. This game sucks. Some of you may be thinking that it may be my computer, and so did I at first. But it is a new PC less the a few weeks old, so I don't think that it is my PC. Again I state DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. I'M BEGGING YOU KEEP YOUR MONEY."
1,This Stinks,"This game is one of the worst baseball games I have played. I play EA games which are much better. Even though this game has great options, the timing and video is terrible, it is not compatible with a Geforce2 GTS. I needs a patch for it, which is not out. The tech support is also terrible, you send a message and you could wait for years. DON'T BUY IT!!!! Get Triple Play!"
3,Buggin' Out on Baseball,"In a word: bugs. Way too many of them. They range from minor irritations (the play-by-play announcer and color commentator talking simultaneously) to major league bobbles, like being kicked out of the game and back to the desktop for having the audacity to hit a fly ball to right field. All of this may be and should be fixed in a patch, but right now I'd advise anyone to hold off and save yourself a lot of frustration.It's too bad. This could have been (and still might be, if the fixes come quickly) a great game. Game play is first rate when it works correctly, and the attention to the strategic details of the game is truly impresssive. Somebody(s) at 3DO clearly know and love baseball. But this year's version has clearly been rushed out of the bullpen without a proper warmup. Wait till the bugs are fixed."
2,Warning this Game looks good but fails!,I can't believe 3do would put out a game that has one major problem: Several computer owners with high end video cards cause the game to crash in mid game. Like other users the game just stops in the middle of the game. The game was working great with my Matrox 2 card but I was hopping to make the game look a little better so invested about ... for a new video card (3di Radeon 32). After installing the new card and running the game it crashes. I do give the game 2 stars because it looks great when it runs put without a patch this game is useless! As of May 2 a patch has not been released and 3do still has not answered any of my e-mails for tech support.
1,OUCH!! down with veet!,"Me and my friend Lauren decided to try veet on our legs, we waited 5 minutes through the extreme burning ( which we thought was normal) then washed it off to find our skin with holes, red patches and plastic looking areas. This was the most extreme pain ever. Veet can go to hell and die. Dont buy it. AND it didnt remove ANY hair."
3,It's okay...,"I'm 13 and I recenly bought the Rasera bladeless version of Veet... it DID remove, but left my skin drier then usual and it looked like my skin had holes in it! So overall, I would say this product was satisfactory... it also left my skin with this strange smell that I did not like... and after I spread it around with my hands and washed it off [my hands], they were all rubbery and smelly! Yuck, that was disgusting, but it did take off the hair on my legs, but the skin was TOO smooth for me and I was not very much used to it...If you just want to remove the hair on your legs and you're not picky about the smell or anything else, go ahead and buy this... but then if you're very fussy about how it turns out, then think about buying the product before you actually buy it! That's all I'm saying..."
1,"Please, don't waste your money","I was very excited to try this product, as I had become tired of daily shaving. Unfortunatly, as with so many things that sound too good to be true, this just did not work as promised. I left it on for a full 8 minutes, and still there were patches of hair left on my legs after I rinsed it off. My legs did not feel smooth, and by the second day after application there was significant hair re-growth in the areas where it had removed hair. So, this really hasn't saved me much shaving time. The only thing this product did for me, was to make me appreciate regular shaving more. Your money is far better spent on some pleasant smelling shaving gels and a good razor."
5,another great book by Penczak,"This is definitely a must-have for those who wish to contact their spirit allies. I haven't done all of the exercises in the book, but I've read through it and can't wait to actually try them all out. His personal stories in the book relate to the stories and really go to show that our spirit allies are real - they're just waiting for us to contact them.He offers self-protection ""rituals"", which is a definite must-do before any spirit communication takes place and different exercises for preparing to contact our spirit allies and actually speaking with them. He also wrote in exercises for casting a magick circle and more. Although it isn't aimed at one religion, it seems more witchcraft-influenced.If you're interested in how to contact your spirit allies, get this book."
4,Packed with Goodies,"The book gives a clear, concise understanding in case you want to delve into Spirit work. It explains all aspects with clarity. A must have for your wicca library"
4,Good intro to Japanese!,"Extremely good book on Japanese manga, humor, and culture. The explanations are precise and to the point. The humor ranges from the off-beat to the hilarious. After reading this book and the giant-sized Azumanga Daioh 600+page book, I understand Japanese humor a lot more and I truly believe it's better than American humor (both American politically correct and uncorrect humor). Recommended for those interested in manga, Japanese culture, exploring the cultural differences of humor, like to read comic books, or just getting inspiration and ideas for your own comic stories."
3,Good for a Star Wars Fan,"My son became a HUGE Star Wars fan at 5 years old. When we did his big boy room, he found this set which is perfect for a young child. The characters are cartoon-like instead of the potentially scary realistic ones. My only negative is the fabric. Even after washing, the fabric on the comforter and sham are still stiff and obviously not of the best quality. However, I didn't purchase it for the fabric, I purchased it for the design and my son absolutely loves it."
3,"Looks great, but feels............","This comforter looks great, just don't touch it! My son is a little more spoiled than most kids, but even kids who sleep on 200 thread count sheets thought this thing felt awful. I take it off the bed at night, and put the ""good"" comforter on instead."
5,One of the best books on the subject of Whiplash Injuries.,The book is well written and provides and in depth look at the diagnosis and treatment of Whiplash (neck injuries). A must read for all health care providers that are serious about treating these injures. May be interesting for some motivated readers not in the health care field.
5,The Best Textbook on Whiplash Ever,"A Tour de Force! Is there going to be a Third Edition? Let us hope so, given Arthur Croft's ability to consume, digest and make palatable to us the most recent research on the topic of whiplash. Fortunately, Dr. Croft is still writing (see his articles in SPINE with co-author Dr. Michael Freeman), and still at the forefront of the profession. As a chiropractic physician, his contributions are all the more important in the medical world, which often borrows from alternative health without crediting it. Not so with Croft, who is credited in medical circles worldwide. A thoroughly readable, well-referenced and enjoyable textbook which will open your mind to a syndrome (group of injuries, really) so misunderstood.Any physician without this text on his/her shelves should not be treating persons injured by whiplash."
4,"Zen and the Art of Intimacy, by Art Samuels",Great book! An honest and helpful sharing of ideas to liberate oneself and bring out the most from your relationships. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in practical Buddhist psychology.
4,Worth Reading,"While other reviews here are highly critical, this book has received wide distribution and readership, and therefore has become required reading.Being a relatively short book (little over 200 pages), it is an easy read, and allows a decent glimpse into RMS' history and life.RMS has played a phenomenally important key role in the creation and preservation of free software, namely through the creation of the Free Software Foundation, the GNU Public License and also through the wealth of important projects the FSF has produced.He is the true messiah of free software, and while his ideals in general may not be unique, he pioneered the freedom movement in digital form which has expanded beyond software alone and into content as well (see also the Electronic Frontier Foundation -- eff.org)."
5,Deep Secret,"Diana Wynne Jones puts J.K. Rowling and Stepanie Myer to shame with her wonderful created worlds, well thought out plots and cohesive story line.This book does not disappoint with it's real characters facing a series of events which would tax most mortal imaginations. The introduction of the Magids and their influence on the many worlds is both intriguing and a little frightening."
4,What a Romp!,"This books main actin takes place in and around a SF/f convention and is just plain fun. It makes you want to read more by her (and I have). Rupert Venables is a Magid charged with helping earth become more magically accepting and in general a better place. But he's now got to find a new Magid trainee as his mentor has died, this book made me wonder if Ms Jones had ever had to hire people.... All I can say is I really don't expect to see anyone disappointed in this book."
5,AN ABSOLUTE GEM,"Diana Wynne Jones does it again. Although this is considered a book for adults, I find all of her work suitable for adults. This one however may not be suitable for children. She weaves together masterfully all of the complex and colourful threads that make up this gem of a book.Her characters have depth and complexity.You'll not remain untouched by them.There are some to love and some to hate, and some to be fascinated by. There is just the right mix of reality, fantasy,magic,blood and guts,romance, and all the other elements that keep one entranced. This world of the Magids was one I wanted to stay in for a very long time. But, alas, I came to the last page. I totally agree with the Australian reviewer, and all who reviewed this with high praise. To Ms. Wynne Jones, keep writing and write faster please. We need more from you."
4,"So, You Feel Like Reading about Magical Governments?","This is a unique book. I didn't guess the ending. But, I didn't like the characters as much as I did in her other books. Also, a little swearing. I was looking for a book for my daughter. If your daughter doesn't mind mild cursing, then go right ahead. I feel this book is more adult than the Howl's Moving Castle books."
2,What a disappointment.,"As a big fan of Diana Wynne Jones' earlier books, I was very disappointed by this poor effort. Perhaps the fact that she was trying to write for adults cramped her style - the story was amateurish, the writing was mediocre, and the shifting points of view were poorly focused. Her other books purportedly for children are actually much better written, whatever the intended audience. I think I'll go back and read one."
5,Another Win in This Great Series,"Solid and well written detective mystery. His Nameless Detective series is just one killer read after another. This one is a stand-out, in an excellent series.Nameless is sort of a misnomer; he has a name, it just never appears. And so; the Nameless Detective. Former cop. San Francisco and environs. Place seems familiar, and after a while so does he.This one has a missing girl - a seductress with a line of captivated and dedicated men left behind. And an undercurrent of despair and problems for Nameless in his relationship with his younger girlfriend Kerry.He is of the old school, and does not seem to wear the new ways and new changes in his world terribly well. But I like following along with his challenges, and hope to see him happier at some point, but that may be just be an idle hope...Pronzini keeps throwing his Nameless creation a ton of curveballs. I'll keep reading as long as he keeps writing them."
2,Truth versus reality,The claim that the Curved Air stuff was recorded in Dolby 5.1 is a fantasy.This is merely a re-master of an old programme filmed for Belgian T.V in the early 70s and it sounded very mono to me.O.K so there isn't lots of Curved Air stuff around but even so it was woefully short.Disappointed as it wasn't really an improvement in quality from the same programme material I recorded from an ITV programme over 20 years ago on VHS tape.
5,"Witty, Poingnant, Haunting Barely Begin to Describe Levi","There are some people who you can never hear enough of. Levi is certainly one of those. He combines one of the greates talents as a writer in this century with a wisdom uncommon for any age.This book is not an adventure story in the typical sence of the word, but reading it is an adventure, and I for one am a better man for having opened its covers.I don't think that Levi has ever written a book that I would only read once. This book, I look forward to revisting many times over. The maximum length of this review is one thousnd words. If all those words were supperlatives, I would not come close to doing this book justice."
1,"A ghastly book: poorly written, dull, pointless","What could be more attracitve? Here's a book about travel in countries all over the globe, and it's made up of conversations between two practical men of the world. A theme--engineers construct things, authors construct stories--ties the chapters together.A great idea, but, alas, one that has been turned into a dreadful book. We're warned in the very beginning that the speaker might, at times, be a bit imperfect: repetetive, full of himself, prone to get lost in details. But the first chapter shows him, despite these short-comings, to be fascinating. Nonetheless, in the chapters that follow, he turns out to be every bit as insufferable as we'd been told in that first page.Each chapter is filled with mind-numbing details of construction projects, only relieved, at times, with brief passages that are more interesting. Levi's book does justice neither to world travel nor to Italian literature."
4,Great writing.,"I am an avid reader of all genre of books; if they are well-written and have an absorbing storyline, I like them. Firelord had both of those key ingredients. I truly loved Godwin's prose, poetically unusual and saying more in a few words than most do in many. The story itself, while an old one, got a new twist with Godwin's interpretation. Thoroughly enjoyable read. If they had half stars, I would have given a 4.5."
1,Horrible!,"I was shocked to find this book has poor grammer, poor editing, and horrible content. The ONLY reason this was published was because he works for the publisher! This book is written by someone in the UK and is very hard to understand simple sentences. The language is not decodeable. At one point, he is talking of the disorder then he is going into HIS personal business experiences (which are horrible examples of this disorder) and then for the ENTIRE second half of the book, he lays out what HE **thinks** is a business plan for making hyper mania and hypo mania make you $$????? This was the CRAZIEST book I have EVER read in my life. I hardly ever do reviews BUT this was insane and I am convienced the author is very, very, sick mental!"
4,Sailing Ships of New England,"If you're interested in the history of sailing ships in the United States, check out Sailing Ships of New England. It's full of great illustrations and provides the same historical perspective as this book. It's also half the price!!"
4,"Frigid Embrace: Politics, Economics, and Environment in Alas",This is a good overview of recent political history in Alaska. It covers the necessary basics of Alaska's recent political events without going into unecessary detail.
5,Take Him to the Heart,"I am a youth minister and Mike Zabrocki's music is perfect for reflection, prayer services and ralley's. The music is not dull and has a life that the church needs today. We need more artists like this, his message is for all age groups, but the kids love it. When I am feeling low and need a dose of faith, Mike Zabrocki's music is there and does the job. I am so happy that Mike Zabrocki's music is available on Amazon, I attended a concert and was turned on to his music, now everyone can find this inspirational music through Amazon, thank God."
5,Great product,This product really helps soothe aches and pains. A 10-15 minutes soak in a very warm tub of water with this product get's one up and going again!
3,"Ok, but too expensive","I guess I should have read the earlier reviews about just how much of this you have to use. It is nice, but using the amount the directions state (1 to 2 cups per bath) you only get 4-8 uses out of the tub."
4,Lovely Treat,I got the peppermint and tea tree oil. As soon as you open up the container you can smell the aroma. It's a good buy for the quantity
1,"Horrible, Don't Get It!!","I am a huge fan of Family Guy, but this is absolute HORRIBLE. Not worth any price. I don't know who was actually in this, but half the characters don't sound like the original people. It's not funny in the least. Occasionally they just resort to crude obscene humour, but for the most part it's just devoid of any humour whatsoever. They're just singing songs. Not funny songs. I like that ""Road to Rhode Island"" song on the show, and I like the show in general, but this is horrible. I can't stress that enough. DO NOT BUY."
2,Save Your Money,"Unless your the type of person who needs to purchase every type of media that Family Guy is on, PASS on this CD.Voices are less than average. Lois sounds like she has a clothes pin on her nose.Basically this CD was released so that the characters can swear. This is confirmed by Seth MacFarlane on the bogus...I mean bonus DVD.All in all, not worth the money."
2,"I love the show, but this CD just isn't funny","Family Guy is one of my favorite shows ever. It's witty, clever, and just plain hilarious, three things this CD isn't. The creators seem to think that having the characters swear and make lewd comments is funny, which it is at first but gets old after the 70th time. The songs, unlike the ones on the show, also aren't very memorable or funny. I only liked two of them ""TV Medley"" and ""Puberty is Gonna Get Me."" This CD just shows that Family Guy is only funny when it's restrained by the networks and the creators have to come up with something other than swearing for the characters to do."
5,Excellent!,"I'm listening to ""All Cartoons are..."" and I'm madly in love with this CD. The lyrics are hilarious, the music is VERY catchy, and if you know all the Hanna Barbera characters from the aforementioned song, the humour multiplies. It's great to hear what the characters sound like when they're turned loose.Peter and Lois have a sweet and funny duet with ""I'm Yours"", while Quagmire's duet with Patti LuPone is just hilarious. The rest of the CD is loaded with great material and it's some of Walter Murphy's best. The DVD extra has some great footage of behind the scenes and you finally get a better look at the Family Guy offices and animation process.My only complaint is that all of Brain's solos are slow songs, but Seth has a beautiful voice, so it's not that big of a deal.EDIT: New complaint. This could only apply to hardcore Family Guy fans, but a lot of the jokes Stewie makes are also from his commentary on the Freakin Sweet Collection. It gets annoying. Still a great CD though."
3,Funny for a while before it wears thin,"With Family Guy back from the dead, let the marketing purge begin! Family Guy: Live in Vegas finds creator Seth MacFarlane and regular voice cast members Alex Borstein, Seth Green, and Mila Kunis (with a host of guest stars including Adam West, Haylie Duff, and Jason Alexander) orchestrate a Vegas-lounge atmosphere as they sing about such lovely topics as babysitting, drinking, and Quagmire's ""habits"" (giggity!), culminating in a medley of 70's and 80's sitcoms. Free from the constraints of network television, MacFarlane and co. are at their uncensored best, for a while anyway. MacFarlane has a surprisingly smooth singing voice on every character he voices, while Borstein and the rest are solid as well. However, the novelty does wear thin after a while, which is a shame. Despite that, this is still good for some laughs, and for Family Guy fans, well, they'll probably want to own this anyway."
3,Good not Great,"While this CD was great to listen to at first, I found that- after a while- I grew quite tired of it. It's hard to listen to on anything but your headphones if you have family or children around because of all the explicit language. When I have company in my car I have to rush to hit next on my MP3 player because it would be embarrassing to let them hear some of the things that are said.I am a huge Family Guy fan, but I think that Seth MacFarlane has been trying too hard recently. If you're a big fan as well, go ahead and buy it. It's worth just having it in your collection."
2,Need more musical number cd's,"I wish Family Guy would do like the Simpsons and release cd's of all their musical numbers. The Simpsons has released about 4 cd's, containing all the musical numbers from the seasons so far. There's definitely been enough musical numbers to do one, if not two, cd's."
2,Watch the Show; Pass on the CD,"The bottom line is that, while I chuckled a few times, it's just not that funny. The key flaw to this project is its success: It seeks to parody the cheesy variety shows of the 70s, and it's eerily successful--WAY too successful. All it did was bring back horrible nightmares of ""Donny and Marie,"" ""Sonny and Cher,"" ""Mandrell Sisters,"" etc. (the f-bombs aside, of course). If they're going to parody something, parody it; don't become it. The musical numbers themselves I found forgettable, and it's unfortunate that they decided to release this project instead of a CD of the show's musical numbers (a la ""Simpsons in the Key of Springfield""). Gratned, musical taste--like comedic taste--is subjective; all I can say is that I think the show is hilarious, and this CD is not."
4,Good but not great,This wine rack is good for the price but needed several slots to hold larger bottles of wine. For regular size bottles it works fine.
4,Pumpin' It Up!,"This is the uncut version of the P-Funk All Stars1983 album 'Urban Dancefloor Gorillas'.For the most part thebest thing about this version is the album cover is MUCH better!And ""Pumpin' It Up"" is still stronger.The main problem with theAll Stars:all they really do is jam endlessly and the comicand absurd elements of Parliament are not present in favor ofthe constant repitition of hooks.Musically it's classic P-Funkbut conceptually it falls far short of the Parliament/Funkadelicmasterpieces George Clinton was turning out just three years earlier.For most devoted fans of the Mothership this must soundlike the P-Funk concept at it's absolute lowest ebb."
5,Cool Book!,I have owned this book before. It is very cool. I particularly like the Ninth Psalm of Yog-Sothoth and the Ritual of the Silver Key.
3,"This book, although inspiring lacks the power it could have.","This book, altough I really liked it, just didn't have the spark ""necronomicon"" had. I really like the setting and mood of this book, I found it more of a fantasy medetation than a reality check. If you are into this sort of thing, I would really recomend this book."
4,Very colorful book but not for lightweights,"I noticed that this magnificent anthology has garned a few poor reviews. Having read it, I can see way. It may not be an entertaining collection for casual or half-hearted readers. Oh, they will enjoy the pastiche stories, but then find the ""translated"" passages of ""ye booke by ye Arab"" to be rough going. This is actually deliberate. If Lovecraft had a chance to review these translated passages, he might concur. The uninitiated should find these pages difficult, but the genuine fan will detect the clever nuggets of wit, rather pokerfaced, and many wil pass right by them. A solid, colorful book. I also enjoyed the description of Abdul Alhazred's demise. In Charles Mitchell's THE COMPLETE H.P. LOVECRAFT FILMOGRAPHY, he cleverly notes how the creature in the film ""Sound of Horror"" was based on the story of Alhazred's death. It is great that this collection included it. 4 out of 5 stars. Recommended!"
3,EXCELLENT -- BUT...,"I bought this book in order to get more basic information on the care of my mixed bag of antiques than is given by Judith Miller's work on the subject. This I got, and in an alphabetical order that makes reference easier. But -- and it's a really big but -- there are three sections to this A-Z, and only one of them (much the largest, it's true) is much use to US users. For, as I only discovered when the package arrived, this is a British publication, unmodified for American use. The products recommended are British products, many of which even this formerly British reviewer didn't know. And the experts and specialist sources listed are also British. The result, for US collectors, is a book firing on only half its cylinders. When you're told to use only this or that specially formulated product to do a particular job, it's pretty frustrating to be unable to buy it except, with luck, at import prices"
5,Love these types of books.,I got one of Leo's books as a gift for Christmas and I would ask for any future books that came out. I like the hints on how to do things on the computer.
1,Disapointing,The author is on an ego trip trying to be entertaining.I wanted a reference book to assist me in understanding new computer technology and its applications; this book is a total failure re that objective.There is no glossary or index to find anything.
5,This is REAL music - Focus Rocks!,"This is an excellent DVD with some fine performances of the group Focus. Considering there is little Focus video available anywhere, these performances are a real treat. This disc includes older, vintage performances of the Hocus Pocus era including that song. This older Focus material is absolutely priceless. If you like Focus, or any other progressive rock like Yes, or ELP this disc is a must see. The disc is only about an hour, far too short, but every performance has value. I love this DVD. Focus were, and are a truly talented band."
1,Horrible text,"This is by far the worst textbook I have ever used in my college career. The text is full of errors, contradictions, and the language is unclear and convoluted. Completely unprofessionally written. The book reads as if it were written by a conceited moron with a degree that he didn't deserve."
5,Mechanical measurements text Brand Frickin' New,Great condition for the price. Looks brand new and I got it 60% off!!!! Buyer is also extemely helpful regarding getting the product on time A+++++. He met up with me when the shipping went haywire. And did I mention it was NEW?!?!
2,Riddled with Errors,While this book is fairly comprehensive and covers most of the material in a complete course on experimental design and analysis it is riddled with errors. There are at least three or four significant misprints in each chapter (most of the most egregious are in the statistics chapter).I have been using this book to teach a junior level course to mechanical engineers and will not be using it any more. The mistakes really confuse and frustrate the students.
2,mistakes,By the middle of the second chapter I realised that a monkey proofread this book. I couldnt believe there were as many stupid mistakes as there actually were.Buy it only if you're not actually going to read it.
4,Outstanding,"If you love Brit iron, this is a must have. If you love bikes put this in your library today."
4,Triumph Rider,"Very good video, delivery was very quick...!!!!! A must purchase for all British & cafe motorcycle lovers...!!!"
1,Horrible pile of cr@p,If you're looking for a shameless self promotion of some California hipsters crappy band then this is the DVD for you. If you also want to learn how to pay other people to work on your bike for you then also the right DVD for you. The people are so out of touch with real britm scanners and vintage racers. A true insult and slap inj the face to the vintage culture.
5,wow in michigan!!,"i just saw casey in concert, and he is amazing. honestly from first appearance i didn't know what i was getting myself into, but as soon as he started singing he blew me away. i immediately bought the cd, and i can't stop listening to it. each song brings a new, and different emotion to the surface. if you buy one cd, this is definetly the one i would reccomend."
3,Beautiful Music...but nothing outstanding,"I first heard of him thru his cover's of Tori Amos ""Butterfly"" & Bjork ""Army of Me"" which were excellent! He's got some pretty melodies but nothing gravitating."
1,Ugh. Nothing new here...,"I keep seeing all these user reviews saying that Casey's music is so different and refreshing, etc, etc. The truth is, there are plenty of Tori Amoses and Sarah McLachlans running around doing this exact thing...the ONE unique thing here is that these sounds are coming out of a man. Say that he has awesome range and I point you to the Buckleys who had the largest known range belonging to a male voice. The thing about them is they still sounded MALE when singing in the upper ranges. Casey does not...he sounds out-and-out feminine and that's nothing but creepy to me. If you like Tori and Sarah, you'll probably like this, but really, there's nothing original here."
5,WOW!!,I'm going to keep this short and to the point. This cd is so good! I first heard a clip of one of his songs on a web page and I immediatly was on a mission to find out who it was. I bought the cd and was not let down. These songs grew on me very quickly. The cd has yet to leave my player and it has been a good while now sice I got it. Give this guy a try. He is now in my top 5 list of favorite artists...and that is a list that hasen't budged in 10 years.
2,Another too-soft brush,"Waaaaay too soft. I can't believe people like this brush, or that they claim it will exfoliate your skin. If they came out with varying degrees of firmness I would give this brand another try."
5,another good book,"This is another good book by Nicholas Sparks. It is and enjoyable story. As always, it is another quick and easy read."
5,Great books,Nicholas Sparks has so much heart. All his books have a soft spot for me and i love reading all his stories and would love it if he produced more.
4,At first sight,This book for me was a fast and easy read however it went in a direction that I had not expected at all! Enjoyable.
4,"Decent product, good price","I bought this for my 93 Jeep Renegade (a YJ Wrangler variant).I was pleased that it came with new rubber hanger bits.It does not include anything to attach the rear exhaust pipe to the vehicle next to the gas tank, and I guess this rusted an fell off when I my old exhaust came off.The pipe is a pain to snake through the underbody but that's not the fault of this product. Jack up the Jeep as high as you can so that the axle is dangling and just keep trying the various angles until you get it.The kit did not include a mid-pipe between the cat and the muffler. You will need to go to a local muffler shop or parts shop and get a foot or two of 2.25"" OD pipe and cut and fit it if you can't save the old one.This is an economy exhaust. The bends are pleated, not mandrel bent, and the steel will not last for more than a couple of years if you drive through salty slush or drive in the city a lot.Oh, my kit did not include instructions but it was supposed to."
4,Perfect for smaller kitchens and those with islands,"This is an ideal space-saving solution for small kitchens. We bought this for our 7-month old and he loves being in the center of the action. Our only complaint is that the extension arms aren't adjustable -- so our island countertop ledge isn't super deep and therefore there is a few inch gap between the countertop edge and where the chair/seat starts. I got around this by buying the Kiddopotamus rubber place mat with catcher lip that hangs down and catches most of what he drops. Other than that, it's really easy to clean, seems comfortable and is really easy to install, take along to family's houses, etc."
3,Not as good as we had expected or hoped...,"We bought this item b/c our son was too big for his baby carrier by 3 months old and he was too small for most other seats. This was OK. He is 8 months now and I don't care for this seat. It is just so upright in the back and since it's all clothy, it has no real support and I don't like that. He always looks so uncomfy. Plus we brought it to go to restaurants but you can't use it (not supposed to) on tables that only have 1 leg or many tables are too thick to attach this too. Just was a waste of money for us. My SIL uses hers still and her daughter is now 19 months old. So to each their own but for us, he likes his booster chair MUCH better and so do we."
4,Handy in awkward situations,"This item was designed to be used in locations other that your own kitchen/home. So the portablility of the seat should be a concern. In this regard it is not optimal. To collapse the chair, you need to push in little chrome nubs. Not the most ergonomic thing for your fingers -- even for a guitar player/ninja. Also the ""nubs"" are somewhere beneath the fabric of the seat -- and I always forget where. How about an ""X marks the spot"" Chicco!When I do manage to collapse the chair it is still about as cumbersome as carrying a tote bag (in addition to the numerous other things you will be carrying, no doubt).Once the chair is in use though, it is GREAT. I don't worry about finding a sanitary highchair. Also if you dine at a booth, the baby doesn't have to be in an aisle. In short, it is usable in various seating arrangements. It seems comforable for baby so I imagine it extends the amount of time you have before meltdowns.Also fyi, people always ask where you got it."
5,all mothers need one,I bought this high chair when I saw it in the store. My son uses it everytime we are out. It stores easily and has many uses. I would recommend this to everyone. My son enjoys it because he is right there with us at the table. The highchairs that resturants offer do not hit the table. This is a most have for all mothers. It is worth the money
5,new parents,We recieved this hook on chair as a gift from my parents because she has one she uses when she babysits and loves it. It is so quick and easy to use. Just clip it to the table and your child can feel like she's eating with you instead of being put aside in a high chair. I would definatly recomend this to anyone. We absolutly love it. It's a great space saver.
2,Faulty product,"We loved this product from the start, until it started to fail. The mechanism that allows you to remove the chair from the table kept getting tighter and tighter on one side. Eventually, it would not budge and the chair had to be sawed off our table. I contacted the manufacturer, Chicco, and they gladly shipped me another chair. Sadly, 4-5 months later, the new chair they sent us did the same thing. Now I have another chair stuck on my table.It is very disappointing because we love the product otherwise. It is great having our daughter sit at the table with us. I also love the low back on the chair because it makes a great hair-styling chair. The back is too high on the high chair and I have difficulty getting at my daughter's hair to put it in pigtails and trim her bangs.Like I said, it is too bad because the concept is great, but the design is poor."
1,Useless!,"I attempted to use this seat on 4 different tables and it only successfully hooked onto one of them -- ironically the one in my home!!!Two of the tables I tried were dining room tables that had a wooden piece running underneath the length of the table for insertion of table leaves. This interfered with the seat's attachment and the seat could not be used.The third table we tried was a booth at a pizza place. The seat was able to attach at the end of the table, however once in place the adult diners were not able to sit down because the seat's attachment rods did not allow enough room between the booth seat and the table for an adult leg to slide through and sit down. Even if the adult slid in first the attachment rods interferred with the adult's leg room. Again the seat could not be used.Also beware that this seat will not hook onto tables with at tablecloth. It doesn't tell you this on the box so I didn't find out until I read the enclosed booklet.Needless to say I am returning this ASAP!"
4,twins mom,"Our 9 month old girls do well in these seats. They like to be at the table with us and it seems comfortable. They hate restaurant highchairs (hard wood, no support). These allow so much more room at tables than using restaurant highchairs, very important for 2 babies at a table. We can sit in booths now, fits on park benches, great for going to other people's houses - we can actually live life! It's so nice not having to figure out how to feed them when we get somewhere and whether highchairs will be available, especially ones with belts that actually work (plus yucky germs). It's not worth taking apart each time, so we leave it put together and just carry it in restaurants. It would take too much time to put together and take apart."
5,The only way to dine out with baby,This is a great High Chair to have. It is a sturdy chair that holds our daughter securely making it much easier for my husband I to enjoy our meals when we are eating out with baby. This chair is lightweight and has a convenient tote bag. It is a snap to assemble at a restaurant. It fits nicely into booths which keeps our daughter out of the restaurant high chairs she can climb out of and out of the aisle where hot foot is being carried. It has been wonderful to have when going to dinner at friends and families homes who do not have high chairs and has been great on vacations with the baby. It is very easy to clean with a damp cloth. I highly recommend this product and will probably buy it as a shower gift in the future. It has really increased our ability to go out into the world (and enjoy it) with our little one.
5,Best High Chair EVER!!,"My wife and I absolutely love this product!!We had a Graco that had the cushion fall apart within the first month of use, and it was such a pain to clean!My wife stumbled across this one at the store and was skeptical at first but decided to risk it.My 9 month old loves it. She is now at the table with us and can join in. While she has been able to climb out of her swing, bouncer chair and nearly anything else she cannot figure out how to get out of this, which I am grateful for.I like that the design is rather plain. It stays on our table at all times and it blends in rather well.We have yet to find a table it doesn't work with.It is super easy to clean and way sturdier than I imagined. My wife is 107 pounds and sat in it to ensure that my daughter would be well supported.The design is amazing and we am grateful to have it!"
4,LOVE THIS CHAIR!!,"I researched these types of chairs before I bought this one. I was a little hesitant because most of the reviews state it is hard to 'take along' anywhere because it isn't convenient to fold up. After purchasing this myself, I have found that once you learn how to take it apart, it fits nicely in the carry bag it came with and is really pretty convenient. I do agree, however, (the reason for four stars instead of five) that it doesn't work at a lot of places due to the fact that it must be used with a four-legged table. I have found that even some four-legged tables are a little unstable with it.All-in-all, I am very happy with it and my daughter really seems to enjoy sitting right there with us at the table. She is 14 months and I just purchased it for her first birthday. I wish I would have researched it long before because she would have liked it much sooner."
5,best on the market,my daughter grew out of her baby car seat at 5 months so we had nothing to do with her at restaurants this product is awesome and beats all of its competitors it is lightweight and comfortable and my daughter loves it everyone comes up to us while we are eating to find out about this great seat and i know we will get alot of use out of it
4,"Nice chair, ONLY....","I bought this 2 days before we flew to Hawaii last holiday. It is a nice chair to have when you're on the go and don't want to worry whether the reataurant will have a hiigh chair or not. It was a great buy, my son sat on it very comfy and less fussy than on high chair. The design is a really nice too. The reason I give this 4 stars is its' weight and when you put it on together - took a while. I found Inglesina (on sale, much lesser than this) works much better. It's much lighter and it snaps like nothing. But, if you don't care with the drawbacks I mentioned, go for this."
3,Not easy to clean!,"We bought this after our high-chair broke. While the seat functions properly, it is a drag to clean. I completely dissasemble it and scrub the fabric in the sink and let it dry overnight. I'm currently looking for a good, plastic booster seat.hope this helps!"
3,It's OK,This product is perfect as a starter kit. You will most likely need to buy more items....but this gets ya started.
5,Perfect but...,i just found out that if you leave your mermaid in the sitting pose for to long her fin gets really ugly at the top.it bends and it gets a line were it was sitting.but most kids aren't going to look at that part!even though the fin does get a little beat up the doll is perfect!!!!!!!!!
5,BEATIFUL DOLL!!!!,"That my daughter loves to play with. We have had no problems with the tale falling off of this barbie. My daughter is very loving with her barbies and this might be the case with that. She loves just to look at it. She doesn't want to get this barbie wet, and I told her for the price , I will buy her another one that she can get wet, sicne she doesn't want to get the one she has wet. SHE LOVES IT AND SO DO I!"
2,mom from P.A.,This Barbie was a disappointment. The Tail is very fragile. I spend as much time reattaching the tail as my daughter does playing with it.
4,Too fragile,"My daughter loves this toy, but less than an hour after she took it out of the box there was a hole in the rubber tail. Now the tail fills with water in the tub. It has to be able to withstand a 5 year old for at least an hour!"
3,Good,Although... I have not install these brake pads on my car. They were delivered in excellent conditon. I would reccomend these brake pads if you're looking for good semi-metalic brake pads.
3,Pedestrian,"Nothing sparkling, effervescent or atmospheric here.Buy the individual pieces performed by artists you know and cherish."
1,too much for what it is,"I got this at a other store and spent 300$. i passed by a cop and the thing didnt go off,but i was doing the speed limit so nothing happen. After that i brang it back. i suggest you should follow the law"
1,"Super sensitive,... TO EVERYTHING!!!!","So many false alarms, you end up becoming desensitized to it. Then, BANG!!! you get a ticket...Beeps at you if a dog farts in a nearby county...Get the Cobra 1050 instead."
4,Price - Performance,"Radar changes all the time. I would compare this one to the best and most expensive - Valentine. The 980 had picked up the newer radar signals almost twice as far as Uniden, Cobra, Whistler, and Escort. The only one that beat it was the Valentine, and barely by a couple of 100 feet or less. For the price it definitely performed. The fact you will be able to upgrade it without buying a whole new unit is also appealing. Just don't expect to beat lazer with any detector. They hit you at about 600 feet with a narrow beam that a window detector probably won't see. And at 600 feet, you have no time to react."
4,Saved me money the first week,"The 980 is easy to assemble and install with suction cups on your windshield. I drive a lot through heavily patrolled twisty mountain roads so you usually see cops too late or not at all. The 980 picks up the signal just before the signal strength increases and you actually see the cop. Most of what I see of real police radar is Ka band, so that's what I monitor, and avoids the unit from going off constantly with interfering singals from non-radar activity."
4,Ibible Pro good stuff,"I love this thing. Great for study and storing my music. The one bad thing about the Ibible/Ibible Pro is the instructions. They are horrible.A better word might be 'useless'. From turning it on the first time to trying to download, the manual gives you zero info, only showing you pictures of the same menus and submenus that you are already seeing yourself, but giving you no instruction. If you are computer or PDA literate you'll be able to figure it out, but if you are new to this stuff, good luck. I would recommend buying it, but be prepared to ask a friend with a PDA for some help."
1,fofo device,"Big build up by seller, grossly overstated capabilities, difficult to use, not user friendly manual,this unit is a joke. I tried to use it but after a short time realized I wasted my money."
2,Good bible but below expectation,This item falls below my expectation. I guess this is due to the fact that I have many other bible software installed on my notebook.
5,sensitive interpretations,"The low price of these recordings is not in keeping with the talent of performer. I love these recordings- even the familiar sonatas 331 and 545 sound fresh and exciting, but not breathless. Wurtz is a very talented artist- I will be looking for more of her recordings in the future."
5,Amazing!,This set is comparable to Uchida's famous set of Mozart piano sonatas on Phillips with much better sound!(not so dry like Uchida's set but with hall ambience/reverebance) I bought this because of J. Morrison's review and completely concur with his sentiments. Great purchase.
4,KBBL,"The playset itself is extremely basic and quite small, without the terrific details or sculpting of sets like Dr. Nick's or Burn's Manor. If it wasn't for the setting, and the inclusion of two fairly cool figures, it would be pretty low on my list. Bill really pulls this set out though, and the serious WOS collector can't pass it up. The casual collector will have to give it some thought though, as the price point isn't cheap."
5,Just love these bolts! can not beat the price,these bolts are very well made and very easy to replace do to the price should you loose 1 or 2 shipping was fast and well packaged. I plan on stocking up on these bolts very soon for my 150lbs draw rifle crossbow
3,You get what you pay for,If you hit anything this is not soft the end will shatter and push into the shaft. They bend easily.
4,Delightfully Eccentric,"Mischa Elman was always his own man, no matter what he played. When his approach matched the music, the result was magical. When it did not match the music, it was still never less than curious. The performances on this CD were made during the last decade of his life but still show enormous vitality and character. The tempi of both pieces are almost absurdly slow (the last movement of Khachaturian sounds dangerously close to a Viennese Waltz! ), and if one has never heard these pieces before, his/her conception maybe warped permanently. This is a disc for well-seasoned violin lovers. I find these performances delightfully eccentric and endearing. The recording is very fine for its age."
2,Left in the Dark,"I liked the character developement and the humor and satire of mocking nearly everyone. The thing that bugged me was what happened to the hero. He leaves the ending hanging. Maybe that should be a SPOILER. Also the translation admits to pages and phrases missing, which drove me nuts. Get it from the library, not worth buying in my opinion."
3,Didn't work for me...,"Translators of Gogol are often said to do more harm than justice to his works - Russia's greatest humorist often end up more pompous than funny, and despite the many number of translations of his masterpiece Dead Souls, very few non-native readers can get at that elusive hilarity of Nikolai Gogol. So it is with this translation of Pevear and Volokhonsky. Accurate to the lexicon and syntax of the original, it yet fails to register the gripping tone of Gogol's original, and the most cardinal of sins - in Pevear's and Volokhonsky's hands, Gogol is just *not* funny. It's a little like translating Dickens without getting any of his comic genius across. Once again, Pevear and Volokohonsky's works get lauded to the skies (uncritically) all over America. To be very truthful, their translations of Dostoevsky is superb, but their translation of anything else in Russian classics - from Tolstoy to Chekhov to Gogol - is mediocre at best."
5,"Gogol's ""Dead Souls"" - The Pevear - Volokhonsky translation.","This new translation of N Gogol's ""Dead Souls"", and a book of his short stories, are a major step forward in getting to the heart of Gogol's own writing of that great book. No other translation has been able bring out the humuor which so pervades the whole, in the original; it really is a laughing matter at last. It is also well worth reading the excellent Introduction to this Everyman edition."
2,A Stale Translation of a Great Classic,"While this translation is better than some I've read, it's still quite pedastrian and fails to capture any of the magic of the original. A good translation, however, may be an impossible task.When the New York Times calls this translation ""fresh,"" does it mean they've actually read the original? I doubt it."
2,So So,"Another author that I was expecting more of after all the fuss over him. Some parts of this book were mildly funny/interesting, but overall it just droned on and on. Had to force myself to finish it."
1,Just bad,"This book just drowns in the satire it tries to create. It takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it's just the same thing over and over again: Meet a drunk, stupid noble; Befriend him; and buy his dead souls.If you can get past that, the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired ""wit,"" as people like to call poor commentary on a society."
4,"I would say, go for it. It is worth it.","So much with foreign literature depends on translation. I always wonder if I am reading what was written. As with all Russian lit I have read, if you can find a system to pronounce and keep straight the names, there is a lot of good.The characters are fascinating and I am a big fan of this period. I wish Gogol had opted to tell the whole tale instead of opting for having segments of the story missing. I guess you could call this a tragic comedy?Anyway, it was enjoyable. It is my first book by Gogol and the only one I picked up. I will have to add another to the list. Next stop when I go back to Russia is some Chekhov."
2,Not for music teachers,"This book was not what I expected from reading the synopsis. As a music teacher, I can only use about one third of the content. The two main problems are: 1. a majority of the activities are geared toward classroom teaching (creative writing, science, history, geography) which are remotely related to music; and 2. Several activities are too complex to be a practical use of the limited time a music teacher has with students.I wish this book had been marketed as what it was, instead of being played out as a ""music"" book. It had very little to do with music or percussion circles."
1,"No guarantee, plenty of rust","I just bought a set of Salerno. I researched stainless flatware and found that 18/10 is the highest quality available. The pattern is very nice, although the knife handles are so thick they don't stack well in a drawer.The BIG problem is rust. I have only washed them twice in the dishwasher and the knives are already starting to rust! We do not have hard water. I called Dansk and they said they would give me my money back if I had bought it directly from Dansk or from an authorized Dansk dealer. Otherwise you are out of luck. They told me to take them out of the dishwasher as soon as the cycle is done (before the dry part of the cycle) and dry them by hand. This seems pretty lame to me."
2,Vespers by Ed McBain,Nothing satisfied. I should have known better by just the title. I read it through anyway) but I found it hard going.Being Catholic I just did not want to admit that such things do happen in the church.(any church) I just wanted to keep my blinders on.
2,"A few interesting characters, but weak plot (plots).","I sometimes enjoyed this book. Ed McBain creates some interesting characters and settings: plots are weak, but who reads McBain for his plots. It would be beating a dead horse to say how unreal, how utterly implausible is the actual murderer of the priest. Nice to see Carrella throw some barbs at religion (sarcasm by me) McBain writes books that can be speed read or skimmed. Actually, one positive: EM does try to get some ""thinking"" into some of the characters. By the way a black would never buy dope from a white guy in a white guy's neigborhood--neutral ground at the minimum. Glad a certain person died at the end: gave the book a tinge of grit. I feel strongly that the sweetest town in Nebraska would have more interesting problems and crimes than in EM's N.Y. Satanic leader was well-developed, as a character, and Satanic ""altar"" was a nice touch."
5,Strong dramatic writing,NOBODY'S FOOL is a terrific sports novel that shows the changing heart in a relationship that grows in depth as the story unfolds. It's football better than FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS told in honest down-to-earth writing.
3,From an Iris gardener in the US,"For a person who needed information on growing Irises outside England and the Pacific Northwest, this would be not be the best first purchase. I can't judge how well it would describe cultural best practice in England but with Irises climate is extremly important. What works in one climate will not work in another, Iris Borer, for example, only lives in North America but it is a terrible pest there. It would make lovely winter reading for most of us because of the artistic photographs and excellent botany of the various Iris species. However don't expect to be able to buy many of the varities shown, the English have their own set of Iris varities and only rarely import the American ones."
3,tortured Torelli,"This bargain priced double CD is of 22 lively, joyfull trumpet concertos by the baroque composer Giuseppe Torelli played on modern instruments. There concerti are well worth a listen, but not on this recording. The soloist completely dominates the performance, Hammes is clearly a skilled trumpeter but is too loud to the point of pain, the listener feels pinned to the the wall. Not recommended.If you are interested in hearing how a baroque trumpet concerto should sound let me refer you to Naxos "" The Art of the Baroque Trumpet, Vol 5, an Italian Concert"". It is an excellent CD."
1,Abridged and poorly proofed,"Spurgeon's material in ""Morning and Evening"" is excellent. This is not a review of his work. It is however a review of this particular edition.Whitaker House has offered up an abridged version of the content and has done a very poor job of proofing it. I have found the book difficult to read, not because I have problems with British sentence structure of over a century ago, but because I often have to re-read a sentence to parse what it was supposed to say due to mistakes in typesetting or typographical errors.Here is a sample from the February 24th morning reading, ""He usually give it in such a measure that there is not room to receive it,"" or ""'As thy day, so shall they strength be.'"" (That should be ""gives"" and ""thy strength"".) This reads like your average 13-year-old's Internet post, not like the writing of a well-educated man of God that was published by someone that cared about what was being said.My advice? Look for a better copy."
2,Print Too Small,"The content, of course, is superb and the cover is very nice. I was disappointed in that the print is so tiny. When I viewed it online I didn't realize the overall size. If you have good eyesight, you're good to go. Otherwise grab your magnifying glass."
5,Uplifting,What great insight Spurgeon has been gifted with! I have used this devotional for years and used it for a gift many times. You will get many years of inspiration & enjoyment out of it.
4,This blast has echoes further down the novel series,"In the near future, the Doctor and Ace become involved in the covert operations of the Butler Institute, who are seeking psychic subjects for their plans to replace human bodies with artificial ones. And then they meet the psychics...The second in the loose Cat's Cradle trilogy, and the first in the War trilogy (the three books in which occur a long way apart), this story portrays a much darker future than those traditionally shown in the Doctor Who TV series.Back in 'Planet of the Spiders', the Doctor was investigating psychic abilities. This research makes a long delayed return, and in the hands of the manipulative Seventh Doctor, you can be sure that something nasty is on its way.Not likely to be well received by people who want a simple continuation of the TV series, it is however a valid view of what Doctor Who could be like."
3,Cyberjunk,"I like Doctor Who. I like cyberpunk novels, but like ice cream and spaghetti they shouldn't muddle together on the same plate. This book has all the elements of a decent William Gibson book except for the devilish glee that Gibson takes in his dystopian universe. Instead there is a lot of gibberish that is supposed to make me feel depressed, and I am depressed reading it. But only because I have a hundred more excrutiating pages left"
4,Missing track,"There is a missing track on this cd. I cannot find the lyrics anywhere on the internet, nor the artist. It is the song that plays when Pete (in the movie) gets a bullseye in the bar and shouts for rosie but sees her and tad kissing (right before the bathroom scene).What is the damn name of the song! If anyone finds out please email me.. help@binaryelysium.com"
2,Jessy Moss Telling You Now,Jessy Moss singing Telling You Now is the missing song on this album - the only live performance in the movie! She has a website that explains a lot.http://www.jessymoss.com
4,Yes In Deedlie Doodlie,"The song playing when Pete gets the Bullseye is ""Telling You Now"" by Jessy Moss (She is actually singing it on stage). If this song had been included, I would have given it 5 stars. But still, with the exceptional (albeit edited) Liz Phair song, and a bunch of other highly listenable songs, I think that this collection is above average."
4,Tad is pretty good -- not great,"Okay, I'll admit to being influenced by the movie, as I was watching the music seemed really good. But the CD without the movie is just a notch less. It's still good enough to buy, but not ""knock-your-socks-off"" good."
2,disappointed,when I received this product I noticed that the case was brokenon the front cover and back. I also noticed that the dvd was notas bright and outstanding in color as it was before. I receivedthis dvd myself for a gift several years ago and it was great.So I purchased it for my daughter and when we watched it I couldtell the difference.This is the first item I have purchased from Amazon that I have been unhappywith. I would have tried to send it back but my daughter told me not toworry about it.
5,Sweet,"Love this dvd, big fan of the roseanne show and the halloween episodes are always great to watch..would def reccommend this seller and this dvd"
2,in the middle :-/,"I ordered this because I love RoseAnne.I received it, and it is brand new... like you would buy something in the store. I was satisfied with everything....UNTIL....it would not play in my DVD player!!!How can a brand new DVD not work????So I am very much in middle on this product...I was happy with the product and the shipping time.... but it totally ruins everything when it doesn't even work!!!!! :'("
3,fair purchase,I have always loved watching roseanne and i love when they make dvds of there favorite episodes especially shows that done alot of halloween episodes like home improvement and this one well its a great show but they really slacked off on the last two halloween episodes they sucked but it still leaves 6 good ones for u to see
1,Worthless Without A Memory Card,"When you buy a game pack such as this you expect it to come with all the necessary equipment. Not so in the case, because this GameCube pack does not come with a memory card which is necessary if you want to save any of your Metroid Prime games.It's Christmas Eve and I now have a bunch of upset kids who will have to wait until Thursday when the stores are again open so I can buy a...memory card. Thanks for ruining our Christmas."
1,sorry but its not halo,"the system is a joke. the graphics, sound and controller stink. No online play, no third party support. The lamecube is heading off with the n64. Bye bye lamecube.Get a real machine, XBOX"
2,Balldriver set? That is what the title says right....,"The title says ball-end set... If i wanted the flat set I would (and did) get Bondhus 13348 Set of 6 Hex T-handles, sizes 2-6mmHowever, my original ball-end set was showing some age, so i thought i would replace them. I bought 3 sets... I need the ball-ends My SHCS screws can not be installed straight, I must be able tilt the tool... What i got was 3mm and down non-ball-end!!"
2,basic but nice,"This one has some nice ideas, but I was looking for something a little more sophisticated. Most of these will change the looks drastically."
4,Wordless Wagner,"For those who can not sit through an entire Wagner opera, here we have Stokowski-Wagner. Stokowski re-orchestrates the vocal parts for orchestra, so what you have here is the best opera for orchestra. It practically proves that Wagner could have written symphonies if he wished. Stokowski elicits lush orchestral qualities from Houston, and the results are sumptous. Reccomended to those who are not opera fans, but enjoy the melodies from opera."
3,works fine,"just a generic cable, but it works fine. My laptop had an S400 port so I needed an S400 plug on one end."
1,Disappointing,Very disappointing. Good thing I didn't pay for this. I borrowed it from a friend. Just a collection of unoriginal writings on the new series that you've probably all seen before. Couldn't the editor have picked some original stories or at put together a more professional package together? Definitely not worth it.
1,Price comparison,"I found the identical item priced $4 less than the price I paid on amazon. Plus, I wouldn't have paid the ridiculous shipping fee, another $4. What a rip-off!"
2,cheap looking and complicated ordering process,"the ""jacket"" was shipped in a very small package and it looks extremely cheap. They also charged me for 2 jackets and told me that i had to re-enter my credit card info more than once. Dont do business w/ this company. Cheap products!"
2,Disappointing,"The various pieces - a stand, three major pieces, and four valves - do not fit together well. Descriptive charts are included to help identify parts of the heart, but since in many instances the drawings do not match what is actually on the heart, it is not very useful for educational purposes. The general appearance of the heart is crude. And though it arrived undamaged, it was flimsily packaged.Amazon's service was good, however. They delivered the heart quickly, and now that I've filled out the return form, they tell me UPS will pick it up tomorrow. I don't like the product, but I appreciate the customer service."
2,Not complete,"The heart arrived without all the pieces. It was very large and I was expecting it to be close to actual size of the human heart. After opening up the heart, I found that the white pieces that were supposed to be around where the valves are were missing and the explanation sheet was missing. I was disappointed with this order."
1,poor,"very poor quality heart, huge doesn't even look close to other models. very disappointed spend a few more dollars and get a better quality heart. not good for learning."
2,for elementry school,"This heart is quite big, and good for elementry students, but not for university or professional use, it is not detailed enough. and mitral and tricuspid valves do not have distinguishing flaps."
2,Anatomical Chart Jumbo Heart not what I expected. Ordered because I thought it would help me in my A&P class. I think not.,"the product didn't meet my expectations. It was a little too big for what I needed it for. also I did not receive the card of heart diagram. I had to sent it back. However, the costumer service was excellent. they picked the product upthe very next day and credited the money back to my account. I will order other items from them but not the jumbo. The auricle of the atrium did not open and the semilunar valves were missing. Not good for studying or for display for class.Some people may like it."
4,A Classic Klindike Tale,"This is the first publication of the poem in a book by itself, and it was long past due. While the artwork is beautiful for its style, I found it a little too modern for the tale. However, I treausre the book."
5,Bringing back memories,"I remember my grandmother reciting The Cremation of Sam McGee to me when I was a child. This wasn't the only poem that she would recite from memory, but it was my favorite ... and I'm sure I wore her out requesting it again and again.It's been many years since I've even thought of that poem, but lately I had been trying to remember ""that poem about the prospector being cremated."" I was able to track down the title and was so pleased to find it at Amazon - along with a few other poems of Robert Service that I had not heard.It made for a wonderful evening reading through those poems and remembering my child's sense of wonder even as I read them with the eyes of an adult who could appreciate the meter and rhyme scheme. I'm very happy to have re-discovered Robert Service's works (and to have had a grandmother who instilled the love of poetry in me)."
1,Skip It,"This should be titled ""As A Man Distracteth."" I have read the original and I couldn't figure out what this was supposed to do. The message is lost in the disjointed text and confusing layout. Buy the original book. This is a waste of time."
1,Tornado Insert,I got in a timely fashion and the insert was in good condition. But it was smaller than I thought
5,Please do not overlook this biography,"Marina Warner made her reputation with this book, a lavishly illustrated history of the Empress Dowager and the world she knew. It is wonderfully well written and succinct. Swift moving enough for a 12 year old, but the history it told was so thorough and so accurate that I was able to come back to the book ten years later, having studied the Qin and Ming in college, and marvel at how much truth she had put in so few pages.Neither a deep work of scholarship nor a startling revision, this smooth and balanced study puts Tz'u-Hsi in context, explaining how she shaped (and failed to shape) the world around her. The lavish pictures push this book close to a coffe table work, but the whole is just the sort of thing to excite someone just getting interested in history, or in China.I don't know what Marina Warner thinks of her early work, thirty years on. I think it a job well done."
5,This Book Made Me Dance,"I rarely, if ever, read poetry but this book jumped out at me while browsing Elliot's in Seattle. I think it was the cover that first attracted my attention but then I was pulled into the stories that the author relates, the journeys on which he goes, the ideas that begin to be dislodged from far corners of the readers mind, the sadness of our world, the happiness in his life even on Judvine Mountain, the resignation of age and yet the joy of experience and discovery. The last poem in the series certainly sets it all up though the reader will find many others throughout that will capture the imagination. I liked the concept of following in the footsteps of earlier chinese poets and longed for the ability to discriminate among types of writing. It's a good read, over, and over, and over."
4,Considering...,"this movie is twenty 6 years old and technology for makeup and special effects hadn't evolved as much as it had today, I feel this movie did a great job with the classic book. Daryl Hannah was excellent in the role of Ayla, the young Cro-magnon woman out of place among a people who were very much into keeping things as they were."
5,Excellent product,"I came across this lotion by accident at my in-laws house. I have a fairly severe skin disorder on my hands - the skin is drying up and is peeling off (exfoliative keratolysis), typically between April through October (the humid months). I've been seeing dermatologists for a few years now, tried a lot of creams, lotions, etc. with no luck. Having used this lotion for the past week, after about 4-5 days my hands are 90% back to normal. WOW!"
5,Thank you Laurie,"As an independent woman settling into my mid-twenties, its refreshing to have language that really addresses the choice of fertility and the personal and social relationship with that choice."
2,A SUPPORTIVE BOOK ON AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT,"Laurie LisleWithout Child:Challenging the Stigma of Childlessness(New York: Ballantine Books, 1996) 273 pagesThe author's personal struggles with the decision;historical examples of other non-mothers.She does not examine the reasons for and against systematically.But this book could add some depthfor a reader who has read other books about parenthood.If you want to know some better books, search the Internet for:""Books Exploring the Decision to Have Children""."
5,Very well researched; in great depth and feeling; EXCELLENT,"I chose to not have children at age 18 - and I've never regretted it. Now in my thirties, I've spent countless hours reviewing and explaining my choice, often for people who had no right to know but insisted anyway. But here, for the first time ever, all the arguments and thoughts I've had about choosing childnessless are discussed in depth and wonderfully in this book. Ms. Lisle wrote the book I would have written if I could have done so. She has my eternal respect and gratitude for putting in print what I've been trying for years to explain."
2,Difficult to get through,"Although the historical parts of this book are great, these moments are few and far between. It seemed to me that this entire work was solely the author's attempt to justify why she did not have children. Instead of standing up for her decision she makes it well known throughout the book that she missed her chance(s) to procreate. This book is most likely for women who fall into that catagory and not for the determined childfree."
1,Dry and dull,"This was a real disappointment. The author's presentation of the historical and personal material is very dry. this book reads like a textbook, threaded with her personal story. The sociological and historical data are interesting, and her insights are ocassionally enlightening, but the delivery is BLAH."
3,Good book with a few errors,"This book gives explanations for the practice test unlike others that just say ""this answer is correct/incorrect."" Overall, good book. However, there are a few errors on the explanation. One question is missing a figure and one question is telling you answer A is the correct answer but if you look at the explanation you will realize answer C is actually the correct one. This book is simple and straightforward, I just wish they would review it and fix some mistakes. Well, if you can spot the mistakes in the book, you'll do fine on the ASE test. Good Luck with the test!"
4,Right tool for the job,"I bought this filter wrench to remove the filter cap from my 2006 Mazdaspeed6. The car uses and ""element type"" filter and there is a cap that holds it in place. This was my first oil change after buying the car used, and whomever did the last service must've used an impact gun to tighten it down - same for the drain plug in the oil pan. Crazy what people do when it's not their own vehicle. I was unable to move the cap with my ""plier type"" oil filter wrench and I didn't have a strap wrench, so I don't know if that would've worked. Anyway, the OTC 6903 filter wrench fit as it should and once I was able to get the right amount of contact and purchase on the filter cap I was able to turn it relatively easily. I'm not a big fan of vehicle-specific tools, and I wish the manufacturers wouldn't make parts that can't be removed with ""common"" tools, but since we haven't reached that utopia yet, it pays to have the right tools for the job."
5,A must have for my 2007 Mazda 5,"This product is a must have for anyone wanting to change their own oil in their 2007 Mazda 5. I found out the hard way that adjustable oil filter wrenches don't work on my car. Local stores didn't carry the proper size (I didn't try my local Mazda dealer as I have reason to believe they'd want WAY to much money). This filter wrench fits perfectly. It is black in color, not the silver in the picture."
1,Does not work on 2012 Mazdaspeed3 2.3L 4cyl engine,"I bought this to do oil changes on my 2012 mazdaspeed3. After realized that this doesn't work, i see all of the reviews are for the old generation mazda 2.3L engines. This is to big for a generation 2 2010+ 2.3L engines found on the mazdaspeed3. The description and compatibility chart should update to reflect this. The generation 2 vehicles don't have a cartridge type filter but a regular canister type filter."
1,Unnecessary tool,"I bought this after reading that my Mazda 3 2.3l required a special oil canister removal tool. It turns out one of my current filter removers fits perfectly. Although Mazda apparently tries to convince us that their oil canister is a unique size, check your current filter removal tools first as you probably already have one that fits."
1,OTC 6903 Oil Filter Socket,"Save your cash. If you own a large pair of channel lock pliers, it will do the job just as well on the Mazda 6, 2.3L engine. There is plenty of room so don't worry."
4,Excellent Cards for General Use,"These cards are nice thin plastic and have a nice aesthetic appeal. They stick to each other at first and don't bridge well but after some use they break in and work great. They are waterproof and would be great for use at a bar or around drinks. The only issue I have with them is that they collect fingerprints, which I would imagine is a pain to clean off every card, but that is a minor issue to me."
3,Clear Playing Cards,"These cards are wonderful if you are like me and my friends, and always have beverages nearby when playing cards. You can rest assured that the group spiller will no longer be a threat to your cards. The downside to these cards are the fact that they are razor thin and are therefore hard to shuffle and handle. I found myself constantly counting the deck to make sure that I am not missing any cards. They are very slick and easily glide on any surface, so if you drop the stack to the floor, one or two can easily get away from you."
4,"Great, but Cheaper Elsewhere","Over the holidays my friends and I played the drinking game Ring of Death and I brought over this deck of cards. My friends were very impressed with them. These cards are awesome, but DO NOT BUY THEM ONLINE when you can very easily go to Books-a-million and buy them for $3 cheaper than if you ordered online and paid for shipping. It's your choice. $8 online, or $5 in store. I know $3 isn't going to break the bank, but it's the principle of the matter."
5,History of the Cleveland Browns DVD Set,"I think this is an excellent set for someone who has just become a Browns fan. The DVD retracing their history is very educational. I also like the DVD highlighting one the Browns greatest games (Browns vs. Jets), Bernie Kosar, Frank Ryan, Ozzie Newsome, and the 1980 Browns team. This would be a good DVD set for a longtime Browns fan as well."
4,A must have,"This video is superb, like everything NFL Films does. My only complaint is it spends too much time on the post-1999 era, which as far as I'm concerned is best worth forgetting!"
2,"Good Potential, But ...","Good Potential, But ...., March 16, 2007Reviewer: debra stark ""Vaducklover"" (No Virginia) - See all my reviewsyou are left wanting sustance to the story. It starts off great and had me hooked but but then about 1/3 through it seemed to rush into getting the two together and the forgivness abound in this book just seemed to happen to fast. Just when you start thinking 'okay now there will be soul to this story it leaves you short'. Cute book but not one I will put on my read again list, not even on my have to go back and reread those certain parts that tug at your heart list. I will of course be giving Ms. Foster another chance since I loved her book Crystal's Heart written with BL Miller."
3,Brahms Symphony No. 4,"I still don't think that this version of the 4th Symphony, by Johannes Brahms, performed by William Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony, would sound as great taken from the Everest master, as it would from the original Command Classics master. The original record, on the gold Command Classics label, would have sounded better than this CD release's version, as I have that very copy at home. I've never heard Stokowski's version of Brahms's 3rd Symphony, but likely I'll never buy this album. I'd rather try to get the original record and try to clean the sound up."
3,this pirate did not survive long,"That's right, this pirate did not survive long. My six year old broke it pretty quick. The axe chopping action was so much fun he squeezed it to death. Not build very durable."
3,leisure suit,"The outfit seemed well made and arrived in a timely manner, However the material was somrwhat unpleasant to the touch. somethig lilke running your fingernainl over a board board. But thiis can be a highly personaL reaction"
1,Dedication is a depressing movie - Stay Away,"I really enjoy most of Mandy Moores movies, but this certainly is not one of them. I wouldn't waste my time watching it, not even as a renter."
1,still havn't recieved it,i ordered this movie weeks ago and it still hasn't arrived. i sent an email to the seller and still have not heard back. very dissatsfied.
3,"mandy's a 10, the movie's a 2","mandy moore is beautiful, sexy and cute. all at the same time. on a scale of 1 to 10, mandy is a 19. still this movie stinks. why hollywood can't find the right movie for a gorgeous, sexy dish like mandy is perplexing. they use to be able to do it with any beautiful starlet. apparently that art is now lost. mandy can even act a little bit but she can't save this disaster. i guess it was an attempt at a woody allen type neurotic, romantic comedy. it's a mess. recommened for mandy moore fans only."
4,not your typical movie!,"I was expecting loo-loo-la-la romantic stuff and got some weird flashy nouveau film! Wow! It's weird but interesting. But it gets tiresome by the end cause nothing really happens :) I mean, I expected some loud romance but didn't get that. It was weird. The way it's filmed is very neat. I liked the ocd bit and heavy objects ! Hahahahaha : I mean, I think it's worth watching at least once. Someone may truly fall in love with this movie :) I certainly didn't expect that from Mandy Moore :)"
3,Good enough,"This is a story of a man who is avoidant and obsessive with a delusion of his dead and only best friend encouraging him to find a nice girl. What a catch!!! Believe me if Henry (Billy Crudup) was ugly nobody would tolerate his behavior. That being said, this is an unusual but touching love story. Henry an author is teamed up with Lucy, an illustrator, to work on a book for Marty the Beaver series. It's touching because Henry slowly realizes that he wants to trust another person and is willing to face his fears for Lucy. However, will that really last once the novelty wears off?"
5,Like jagged glass,"a bit dark, a big uncooth and broken, but beautiful, shining nevertheless.I'm hesitant to compare this film to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind. Still, it's very much that kind of genre. So if that's your thing, this movie will deliver in every possible way and throw you through an entire spectrum of emotion and then some. It's believable, original; and yet still, very magical. Don't be fooled by the bland cover art, it's fantastic."
4,not your average romantic comedy,"This romance has a hero who is edgier than most and not very likable on the surface. Little by little, he starts to get under your skin until you are hooked, even though he seems determined to sabotage the whole thing. Very well acted and written."
1,worst experience buying from amazon,"I paid over a hundred dollars for this item, and what I receieved was a cheap watch worth about twenty dollars.If Amazon can not control what is being shipped, they should not sell it. They make it too complicated to get a refund or to get the watch that was ordered."
4,A good story in verse.,"What is the last novel in verse that you read? Perhaps Yevgeny Onegin,by Pushkin?Well this isn't a novel of THAT calibre. But it is a good story told inquatrains that speed along so that you forget you're reading poetry.Vikram Seth, author of 'A Suitable Boy', tells a tale of modern San Francisco."
4,a fun read,"The Golden Gate is Vikram Seth's first novel. It is set in the eighties in California and tells of twenty-somethings: John, Phil, Janet, Liz, Paul, Claire, Sue, Ed, Rose, Chuck, Matt, Joan, Bjorn, Mike, Rowena and Schwartz, who are looking for love, pleasure and the meaning of life. Witty, funny and moving, the whole novel, from Acknowledgements, through Dedication, table of Contents, the body of the novel and even About the Author are all cleverly written in verse. This delightfully different novel showcases Seth's talent as a poet. Described by Gore Vidal as ""The Great Californian Novel"", this is a fun read."
5,It brings out the poet inside you,"I have read this book three times and its been as refreshing every time. An excellent book for a person with a taste in romance and poetry, although I do not agree with Seth's pessimistic philosophy that passionate relationships never end up in happily married ever after! The best part about this book is that once you finish reading this book, you tend to write in verses yourself!"
3,A book of mixed merit,"Technically, this book is excellent. The poetry is extremely well done, the characters are well-drawn, and the pacing is just right. The story itself, however, is one I can't imagine tolerating in prose. It could be described as 'Musical Beds.' It's a rather bleak tale in which a collection of people with no concept of sexual morality worth discussing fall into and out of each other's beds in succession in a desperate attempt to bring meaning to their lives. Believably and realistically, this procedure doesn't work very well for the characters in the story. My problem is that I wanted to read a different story. 'Musical Beds' just doesn't hold my interest."
1,Annoying,"I had to read this for a course in Asian-American literature, and I found it to be a difficult book to read. I kept tying to put the verses into sentences to make it easier to read. I had to keep putting the book down because it was so annoying!"
4,Favorite book of my cat,"I read this book in twenty sittingsAlone but for my Bovril teaAnd after twenty eyebrow knittingsI pulled the covers over meHigh as the pale marijuana smokeThat covers my bed when I try to toke.""Now don't be greedy,"" my cat said,""As someone to whom you have read,I pray thee, Kevin, read some more ofThat book The Golden Gate by Seth!""""My fault, cat."" ""It's not life or death,But that is one of the books I love.""And grinning like the famous CheshireWe settled in; my nap grew meshire."
4,"Wonderful, poetry and a lovely story.","This is a wonderful story, full of life and detail, it is many years since I have read it, but I remember how I wept at a certain point in the story. This book is very readable, the use of verse makes the text flow any stays in my memory as a beautiful thing."
3,A bit hard to get into...,"Vikram Seth possess a heap of talent...he's a great poet, a clever wordsmith-and if you take his self-depricating asides in this and ""A Suitable Boy"" seriously, a nice guy. But this book didn't quite work for me. The basic plot line seemed silly and a little dated, and wrapping it all up in this poetry package couldn't change that. It's full of lattes, pet iguanas and yuppies, which gets a little tiresome.It just kept making me doze off at night. I'd read it out loud (better for the rhythm of this thing), after a while, the meter and the wording seemed forced, not clever."
1,I have gained a lot from this and Mark Larsons book,This is a great presentation and I am glad I have this one in my collection. It has given me the tools to concentrate on technical indicators that are important and useful as in the book Trading Stocks Online that he wrote. worth a look at.
1,bad bad bad quality,"Look i have seen what the people went through as a own many of these films,but the quality of this is so bad they should not be allowed to sell it.True nobody forced me to buy it but i have many films about the Holocaust that have been restored to good quality.This is not one of them."
1,"""Personality"" And Not Much More...","This is not the best 50's collection....A lot of the songs don't sound like the ones you hear on the radio. The only reason why this cd is worth buying is if you like the hard-to-find Lloyd Price song ""Personality""."
3,Decent Small Book with Porsche History and Development.,"I am not a Big Porsche Fan, (due to the Nazi Connection By Dr.Porsche Whether Porschephiles want to admit it or not through the excuse of ""wanting funding""for his little sportscar,Instead making the Peoples Car-Yes The Volkswagen was concieved by Hitler and Put into Reality by DR.Porsche) I got this book, Because I like the 911, I am disappointed as with most Porsche books that shows little or no coverage of the 930 slantnose, the book shows 1 or 2 slant noses, and some history about questionable owners, and how it was a drug dealers car, and there's many imtation slants out there. Other Than That, Decent Porsche book on the ""HOTROD VW"" AKA Porsche."
3,"Just an overview, that's all.","If you're buying this a gift for someone who otherwise knows nothing of 911's, then go ahead. Otherwise, you'll most likely want a book with more depth. The pitcures are very nice, but the coverage of each model is very light. There is almost no information here at all for someone looking to buy used porsches. Case in point - the author is very negative on the 964 model (89 through 93), and there is not one photo of this car - while there are 5 of a white RS America! OK, OK, we get the point - you hate how the 964 looks. Besides the fact that readers may disagree, why eliminate 4 model years from the photos?This book isn't bad, but it's far from great."
2,rip off,I guess it's my fault for not reading the description but i have this on vinyl and this cd only has half the songs. WHAT a HUGE disappointment!
3,Good,This album is good. This is their first album. And it's very rare. My favorite Atlanta Rhythm Section album is Quinella *****.
4,Nice Gazebo,"Very stylish and extremely simple to put up. I found this gazebo holds up pretty well in harsh weather. sometimes rain gathers on top despite the holes, but it is easily pushed off. metal frame also is slightly weak and thus will not support snow without bending. Material could also be a little more durable so strong winds do not cause tears. Overall extremely pleased. Wish the price was a little lower as I would order a new one each year. I also liked that the shipping on this item was not hundreds of dollars like I have found with other gazebos. If you do not have a 10 x 10 foot area and need something a little smaller I think this is a good choice."
4,Good step by step creation guide,"I didn't find this book to great when it came to the listing of amulets and related information. On the other hand, its step by step interactions for their material creation is very much worth it. If you combine this book with one on solid amulet creation (in a spiritual sense) then your set."
4,Decent sound,"if you don't have a lot of money, this is the one to get. you will get a decent sound. MX966 is good for movie but not for music. If you can afford more, I would recommend to buy the Receiver and Speakers separately, instead of buying them in a package."
4,Passionate mind,That's an outstanding documentary that give us an idea of this brilliant mind through the eyes and memories of those who had the pleasure to interacte with Carlos Kleiber.Also show us his extreme perfectionism and his self-critical that led him to limit his recordings and appearances; therefore this is a good way to complement the legacy he left behind.
2,tim's input,"This video was quite the let down. After watching stories on Nickie Barnes, and Frank Lucas I expected so much more from the build up of Guy fisher. It seems that what was said about him in those 1st two videos was all there was to say. I found out nothing new about Guy Fisher in this video."
1,Dissapointing all round..,"I have to say that I was very dissappointed with both the quality and content of this short DVD. I was expecting to hear feedback from a former associate or family member of Guy Fisher(I realise there probably are not too many around these days.)Instead, I saw old footage from "" 60 minutes"" and personal opinions from people on the streets. Hopefully a more reliable source will be released in the future."
4,Bumping Set,"got this tape a long time ago.it was the last all out Funk Set by Ray Parker Jr before He went mad pop.Ray Parker Jr is a Very Talented Multi-Instrumentalist but after this set He just went Pop wild.still on this Set the Vocals were cool&the Grooves were strong especially by the Parliament Funkadelic Inspired ""For Those Who Like To Groove""."
5,Del Jardin de la Esquina,"I heard this album many years ago in Bogota, Colombia and then in Buenos Aires. This is a great musice piece. Some songs have Fito Paez as the main voice, piano and/or guitar. It is fun to listen. My son - 7 months old - loves it."
3,Flower of the Pacific Revisited,"Though it has been a number of years since I read this book, a couple of things stick out in my mind, which probably makes a review more valid! If I can remember it for years, it must have validity. First, the author did her homework on the Pacific theater of World War Two-or seems to have to a pacifist that didn't serve in that theater. Her discriptions seemed authentic and her knowledge of actions and events and locales seemed on target as well. Her love interests were toooooo romantic for me and did not seem to contain the realism of the other aspects of the book. That aspetc smacked of historical romance-but maybe that's just unromantic me. All in all, a good read."
2,A good writer but decides to ignore the past,"The main problem with Hermetic Kabbalah is that its based on a decision. A decision made by Englishmen during the last few centuries to take what they wanted from whatever mystical tradition existed and use it. The big problem is that they never asked the people who used the traditions. This led to a very large number of mistakes and mistranslation. Rather than write a book and try to reconcile these problems, the author ignored them. In doing so he wrote an amusing book that has a relevance limited to the works of the Golden Dawn. I'm disappointed that Hermetic Kabbalists don't recognize the mistakes made by the GD in the beginning. This is why Jewish Kabbalists look down at the modern Hermetic tradition."
2,Not helpful. Not that funny either.,"If you are looking for a simple,common sense introduction to Kabbalah by someone with a sense of humor and perspective on his subject, you will find this book a disappointment. I don't know much about Kabbalah and, after reading this book, I still don't.On the other hand, if it is wit, satire and parody you seek, you will find yourself reading page after page waiting to get the joke. Kabbalah is mysterious enough without having to solve the mystery of what this author was attempting to accomplish."
4,Enjoyed by both teacher and students!,"A most humourous and ""illustrous"" text book for both teachers and students of Qabalah. What an amazing way to make the discovering of numbers clear. Prof. Friedrich Weinreb, mathematician and Qabalist, author of ""Schöpfung im Wort"" (Roots of the Bible) would have been delighted with the display of the students of the Zerubbabel Institute of Philosophical Youth (520 B.C.). I spent a whole night and part of the next day reading this ""unbelieveable"" book."
4,My 4 year old likes this toy,"My four year old daughter really likes this toy. She has quite a large Little People collection and this fitted in nicely. The bus has a few noises and words it says, its not too loud. We have had it for over a year now and the noises have not worn out yet. She has managed to break a door off the bus, but it was easy to snap back on."
2,Not beeps the bus,"We ordered the ""beeps the bus"" from this cite since toy stores are now selling a new version called ""lil' movers bus."" So I was very disappointed to find that the bus we received was the newer version which plays the ""stop and go song"" and does not move its eyes. Had I known I would have picked it up at the nearest toy store and saved myself the shipping charge."
5,great toy,"My daughter recieved a Little People bus when she was 21mo old. She played with that bus almost every day. It was one of her favorites. That was 8 years ago. She had so much fun with this toy that I kept it. Since then it has gone to her two younger brothers. They push it around and fill it with all sorts of little people (farmers, truck drivers, ect.) Our bus does not play music or have lights. (due to purchase date) It is purely imagination. But definitly a well made toy that I will keep beyond my kids. Hooray for the LP bus!!!!!"
3,Wheels on the Bus!!!,"This doesn't keep my little one entertained for hours but she is a girl, so that might be why. Her favorite song is the Wheels on the Bus, so she'll press the little horn button inside the bus and sing and dance. Really cute!! She's only 2years old and she's never played with or shown any interest in Little People and I believe that I read somewhere that they don't get into imaginary play until they're closer to 3. Not for my 2 year old but very cute nonetheless."
4,Another little people success,"I bought this for my 11 month old daughter b/c she has shown an interest in little people toys at play group. I like the fact that it has so much room for growth (ages 1-5). First it's a nice chew toy, then familiarity with people and every day items. Second the little people are very diverse. Third they are very durable and should last through multiple children and whatever they can throw at it. Can't go wrong with this toy."
5,masterpiece,"I have had this cd for at least a dozen years, and have listened to it thousands of times. I never grow tired of it. It is not just the beauty of the music you hear, you experience it in the depths of your soul. If the sounds of the spiritual ether could be recorded, this is it."
5,beautiful music,this music is relaxing and peaceful.I enjoy just listening or practicing my tai chi while it's playing.
3,"Okay, but not as good as some of his other work.","This CD may be perfect for a slooow meditation, however I enjoy his other CD's more that have some life to them."
5,"For those in search of peaceful, healing music","I highly recommend this recording to anyone looking for peaceful, healing music. I am a professional massage therapist who has played this CD during massage sessions. It seems to produce a soothing effect on both the client and has enhanced my skills as well. These beneficial effects were noticed by another massage therapist receiving a massage at the time. I regret that it is no longer in stock and look forward to the time when it becomes available again."
5,One of my favorite meditation CDs,"I have owned this CD for a couple of years, and never tire of hearing its soothing, calming, meditative sound. Every track has something different to say and can transport you if you let it. Very spiritual."
3,I was disappointed,I was disappointed. I have a new puppy who was about 9 weeks old at the time. I was most interested in house training the dog. The only recommendation she gave was when you first bring the puppy home. I already had the dog at least 2 weeks when I purchased the video. I bought it used and paid over $20 for it. Her tip for training the dog was useless if your dog had already been allowed to walk in the house. Most people do not get a video on training a dog until they have the dog. The video seemed trite and unreal. All the dogs caught on immediately it seemed. It was not helpful to me.
3,"Content is great, but DVD Implementation is flawed","WordWorld is great, and the DVDs for my two-year-old are awesome. She says ""Woof"" when she wants to watch this DVD because Dog is so cute, and she spells along with the animated Build-A-Word sequences. The content is top-notch!What I do have a very big problem with is the ""Hopla"" trailers that run automatically at the end of the WordWorld disks. It's pretty sneaky to piggy back another series for toddlers at the end of a series this good. It's just an unwelcome commercial, which I shouldn't have to deal with since I *bought* the DVD. I definitely DO NOT want my daughter to watch the inane Hopla series and would never buy it. Unfortunately, the jingle is permanently stuck in my head after hearing the first few seconds three or four times in the background before I could stop the DVD."
4,Pastor Flash revealed...,"I have not read or seen this book since the early 70's, and by then I had committed FST's albums to memory. However, given that there was always multiple dialogs going on, at a variety of levels, it was great to see the dialog in print.The dialog on the T.V. as Ralph Spoilsport sells the 1968 Narc Avenger is revealed, as it the censored newcast regarding the man-made baby Adam One-Three.While I do have most of the material committed to memory, I highly recommend this book. Not only does it clarify certain passages in ""How Can You Be In Two Places..."" and ""Don't Crush That Dwarf..."" it also brings FST's broader vision into view.Definitely a must have."
5,A great collection - long out of print.,"""The Big Book of Plays"" is the first of two books put out by the legendary comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre (Phil Austin, Peter Bergman, Philip Proctor, and David Ossman) during their heyday (it was published in 1972). It is a collection of pieces from the troupe's first four albums. As such, it allows the reader to finally fully penetrate the oft-times impenetrable texts of the group's records. The pieces included are ""Waiting For the Electrician or Someone Like Him"" and ""How Can You Be In Two Places At Once When You're Not Anywhere At All?"" from the albums of the same name, and the titles ""Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers"" and ""I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus"" in their entirety. The plays are accompanied by a plethora of photos, a foreword from each member, and a chronology of the group's career to that point. Good luck finding a copy but, if you do, grab it! It's great."
4,Not Quite the Solution I Was Expecting,"I love the FT, and despite having listened over & over to the recordings scripted in this book, there were elements I could never make out -- stuff buried under multiple layers of sound (e.g. Ralph Spoilsport), or words here & there I just couldn't make out. At last, I found and bought this fabled and sought-after book, thinking it would explicate all -- but no. Some of the dialogue simply isn't here.I don't regret buying it; it did indeed make clear what I'd misheard, and it's great how it ties stories from the first four albums together into a single surreal odyssey. But it wasn't all I'd hoped for, hence the deducted star."
5,A very comprehensive and thorough book.,"I recommend 'The New Book of The Marine Aquarium' by Nick Dakin. The information he presents is accurate and he covers all aspects of the hobby from fish only tanks to reef tanks. He covers all of the possible equipment that you might need for an aquarium in a very comprehensive manner. It also has a very large appendix with dozens of fish and invertebrates and information on their feeding habits, aquarium behavior, and compatibility with other fish/invertibrate species. All photos are of very high quality and in full color. Overall, it is a very thorough and well written book."
4,Exceptionally useful! Lacks newer ideas though.,"This book is great for aquarists of all levels. Every page, except for the index, has full color pictures. Not a single B&W diagram through its 400 pages. Comprehensive information on the biology and behavior of numerous fishes and inverts. Only drawback is that it does not seem to have the most recent information. Concepts such as the ""Berlin method"" are not even mentioned. Overall, a great book for the cost!"
