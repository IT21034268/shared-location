4,"So far, so good!","Purchased this for my 6 month old niece. Chose this product rather than the standard activity table because she is always trying to bounce and jump when being held. So far she loves being in the jumper and it seems to hold her interest for a decent amount of time. Based on experience so far I could have rated this item 5 star, but decided to go with 4 star since they have only had it a couple of weeks and the final verdict is still out."
5,Going strong,"We got this for my daughter when she was 4 months old. She liked it then as a place to hang out and look around. Now, when we put her in there, she LOVES jumping around, pulling at the toys, playing, exploring, etc. Love this jumperoo!"
5,Perfect for the baby that likes to bounce!,"I bought this for my 4 month old becuase the activity saucer that we had just wasn't cutting it. I was nervous getting this at first becuase I wasn't sure how she would fit in the seat. Mainly was it going to be so she wouldn't be held in when it she was jumping around. I'm so happy with this! The seat is a good size and good depth that she fits snug in there, but has room to grow. The head support in the back is a great feature, it prevents her head from going back and gives her a place to rest it too. She is a bit too short to touch the floor but that is remedied by putting a pillow under her feat. I know it's suppose to fold up to save space, yes it folds, but it doesn't save that much space. This item takes up a lot of room, but it's worth it!"
3,Jump and Bounce Fun,Hours of endless jumping and bouncing. Great to keep your child entertained while cooking or doing house cleaning. Very bulky...takes up lots of space. Not easy to move room to room. One of the attached toys just flops over and lays there:o/ Don't buy until your child can support their head on their own! Not enough height options. Hard to take apart to wash seat cover.
3,Where's the bounce???,We bought this after already owning the Fisher Price Deluxe Jumperoo which our baby loved but was actually second hand after being used by our second son. We thought this looked SO cute and liked the fact that it seemed to combine features of a jumperoo and an exersaucer. We thought if we bought this we could eliminate the need for 2 large items. We were very wrong. Our daughter hated this jumperoo. It just didn't have any bounce to it no matter what height adjustment we set it on. There just wasn't any spring to it so she would get really frustrated and cry. We would take her out of this jumperoo and put her back in the original one and she would happily jump away for 20-25 minutes completely content. Every baby is different but mine wouldn't sit in this jumperoo for longer than 3 or 4 minutes.
4,Love it,"My five month old loves it. It's a little hard to put a squirmy baby in it by yourself but besides that its a great bouncer. Watch out for little fingers getting smashed by the elephant when it turns, it has some force behind it!"
4,"Great, but the leaves can break and get in babies face","I have no issues with this jumper, it has been a lifesaver for me! My little one has been walking for two months, but he will still go into the jumper for a little fun time. I do wish it would go a little lower for the short babies. My kids are always short and their legs cannot reach until they are about 8 months :/ Also, the leaf above the head snapped very easily and it hangs in my childs face and can aggravate him...small complaint, but worth noting."
4,rainforest jumper,"My grandson loves to jump (he is 8 months old) . And this jumper keeps him happy. The only problem I have with it is his feet don't touch the ground, when he is still. I guess he has to grow into it. I intially put a pillow under his feet so that he could get his jump on."
5,Must Have For 3- 4 Month Old,"I bought this jumper as a Christmas gift for my 3 month old. From day one, she has absolutely loved it. She can spend up to 40 miinutes in it and be completely entertained. The jumping and music is adorable. I think this is a must purchase for any active baby with good head control."
4,Fisher-Price Jumperoo,My 6 month old seems to like it well enough & sometimes she jumps like a little maniac! The only thing I would change is more toys & a variety of songs.
5,Caved in to mass opinions,"I must admit, everyone I know with babies has this. I was trying to assist my baby walking the old fashioned way, but I learned the hard way. Babies need exercises too, to stay lean and grow tall. What's a $65 compared to baby's good health?"
4,"Will be a good product, I think.","At four months, my baby is a bit too small for this. On the lowest setting, her feet can't reach the ground yet in order to get a bounce. But the product looks sturdy and engaging. It's a good next step from the bouncy chair because she likes to be upright and see everything around her.I'm giving it 4 stars because the firefly toy does not function. It slumps over rather than stands up, so my daughter can't really play with it. Also, the rainbow/cloud toy is missing the colorful rainbow stickers. It's only an aesthetic thing, but still, less visually interesting than advertised. And lastly, the seat is a bit stiff and doesn't turn easily. Hopefully, as she gets older, she'll be strong enough to turn around in it.One last comment, if space is a constraint, be sure to look at the advertised dimensions. The product is much wider than it appears in the photograph."
4,Baby's weight and height for Rainforest Jumperoo,"This is a question. Could you Mom's and Grandmom's please tell me what weight and height is the maximum for the Rainforest Jumperoo? My grandson is 9 months old, weighs 25 pounds, and is taller than many his age. I am interested in the Rainforest Jumperoo, but I wonder if he is too big for it. Please help. Thanks"
3,Item is good.,I liked the item. My son enjoys it. I hate plastic though. I want big toy companies to make products in more eco-friendly manner.
2,baby is not thrilled with this one,"the walker is securely snug. It has little toys on it that look like fun, but actually aren't. our baby grandson isn't interested in the toys. The only one he's interested in is the material butterfly and he chews on that. He's not in this walker for very long."
5,Could not have done with out. I consider this a MUST HAVE for sanity!,"My daughter LOVED her jumperoo! She started sitting in it at around 3 months of age and once she figured out what it was for, she was so happy and was hilarious to watch. She loved sitting in it as much as she loved her swing, but it allowed her a view of the room and she was able to play. I can't wait to see what our son thinks of it. We have the best home videos of our little one in this. It's awesome!"
4,awesome,I love the look to this. My nephews LOVED it and mt son liked it. I hope my daughter will enjoy it as well
5,So easy to put together,My hubby put this together in less than 30 minutes. My grandson loves it. It is so colorful and has so many things to stimulate him. I can see him using this for a long time (he is only 4 months old).
5,I had to buy two of these!,"My six month old triplets love this thing SO much that I had to get two of them - someone is ALWAYS jumping at my house. My son and one of my girls jumps so hard for so long that they are constantly falling asleep in the thing, and these are not babies who will just sleep anywhere! Check out my photos attached to this item. This jumperoo is worth it's weight in gold - I love how it combines all of the great aspects of an exersaucer with the ability to jump. My little ones seem to love all the toys, which are very developmentally appropriate. Good job on this one Fisher Price!"
5,my daughter loves it!,"My daughter is 5 months old and loves this toy. It has lots of little toys on the table part to keep her interested, plus she loves to jump. It is very sturdy, and well made."
5,jumperoo,"My son loves it, it has great head support and keeps my 6 month old busier for longer than any similar toys."
4,Center of fun,"My daughter is 6 months, and jumping all the time in my arms. When we tried out a friends jumper, we knew that she needed one of her own because she loved it so much. This activity center isn't the most engaging, but she seems to love it so far. The best part is that she gets to jump over and over and over again! She's a bit afraid of the music, so we leave that part turned off. The only negative is that it's such a large toy for our small apartment, and we only have enough space for it in our living room so we have to break it down if we want to watch TV."
3,Jumparoo,"My daughter began to enjoy her jumparoo between four and five months. She likes the lights and enjoys sucking on the floppy bee toy. She loves to stand, so this is one of the best ways to keep her entertained if I need to set her down for a few minutes.Edit - I felt the need to add that at 6.5 months, my daughter was no longer entertained by the jumparoo. She preferred to move around on her own and didn't like being restricted. Because of the short duration for which it entertained her, and the relatively large price tag, I'm reducing my original rating."
2,Watch out for the springs!,"While my daughter has gotten a lot of fun and happiness out of this Jumperoo, there is one part of it that we feel is very unsafe. The two parts on top that snap in and dangle can come flying out when tugged with enough force. My daughter easily rips out the parrot and can rip out the frog too. We've actually stopped putting them back in because we're worried that one day it'll snap out and hit her in the eye."
4,Cute and fun.,"First I would like to suggest better instruction for assembling this product. I did have some trouble putting together the seat cushion as the pictures truly do not offer much help. Besides that, my 3 month old is really beginning to enjoy being in this jumperoo. I ended up putting a pillow under his feet as he is a tad short to reach the floor still. It's very colorful and stimulating, he even likes just sitting in my lap and looking at it. The bird and the frog hanging should be placed lower so they could be reached easier, and I am not sure if the little creature with wings is supposed to stand up since ours just flaps over and he cannot see it to play with it. Overall it is a good product that I would recommend."
5,My grandson just loves this!,"The Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo is just awesome! Very easy to put together, and what a joy watching our little grandson bounce around in this thing! Totally NOT a piece of junk like some are. The seat is very supportive, and seems comfortable for him, and the toys are very bright and cute - they seem to hold his interest very well. He loves it, and will jump and bounce until he falls asleep in it! A very nice buy - if you're on the fence between this one and the tons of other jumpers out there on Amazon, just get it!"
5,My son LOVES this thing!,"We have been very pleased with this jumparoo. It is easy to put together and we deem it to be safe for our child. We started using it around 5 1/2 months and he loves being in it. It allows me to get things done around the house. The only word of warning is to make sure your child has socks on. He jumped so much, it caused a blister on his little toe!"
4,Such a great bouncer!,"I wouldn't recommend it if your baby is a more adventurous little rascal though. Mine used to love to jump around in this, but after a mere 2 months, and he doesn't quite like it as much. Other than my baby's opinion, this is a perfect bouncer for babies! Your baby will love this. I would love to note that, back when he loved it, he would have so much fun that he would get so tired and fall asleep on the bouncer. That is how fun this jumper is!"
3,Overhyped,"The overwhelming reviews prompted me to get this jumperoo for my baby girl. What's a nursery without a jumperoo, right? She was 6months old then and hated being in it. But after a few tries, she grew to like it....but not for long. She gets bored with it after 10-15min of play time and wails to get out of it.I've barely touched it these days and it sits in a corner taking up a huge lot of space in my cramped apartment.Would be better if you actually get to try the product first before deciding to buy, then again, every baby is different."
5,Super Investment,"Our 5-month old grandson simply loves this jumperoo! He is able to turn himself around (the best feature by far) to not only play with different items on the jumperoo itself, but also to keep up with activity going on around him - especially when moved to the kitchen. He can feel like he is part of everything and we don't have to turn the jumperoo everytime we reposition ourselves in the kitchen. If he's interested in seeing us, he simply moves himself - he just loves eye contact at this stage! He is able to jump, as well, but more of that will come as he gets older. For now he is content with the various activities and sounds of the jumperoo - and definitely likes the ability to move with us."
5,great item,"this is a great product to entertain and contain my 7 month old. she loves to bounce and play and it keeps her in an upright position to watch me in the kitchen,etc. particularly helpful for the new sitter/crawler when you need to keep them safe/contained for awhile. my older daughter had an activity center with a disc shaped base that didnt bounce as much, not sure if it is the kid or the toy but this more bouncy one seems to keep her happier longer, older daughter wouldnt stay content for more than a few minutes in it."
5,Baby Jumper FP Jumperoo,My 4 mth. old granddaughter just loves this. It is very interactive and secure. She can really stretch her legs and exercise them jumping and kicking. It is just great. Easily cleaned off and comfortable.
5,"Highly recommend, my son loves it!","I bought this Jumper based on the reviews, and I am very happy with the purchase. It arrived as promised, was easy to put together, and my son loves it. I like that it uses smaller batteries, I dont like to have to buy cases of C and D batteries for all of the toys....My son will spend 30-60 minutes in this once or twice a day, and I am grateful. He often doesnt even need the music on. I will definatly be keeping this jumper for our next child."
4,Very good Jumperoo for the price.,"Our child loved this from a very young age. Some days he would bounce himself to sleep from excitement. The adjustable straps work well for changing as your baby grows taller. Having the removable and machine washable seat is nice and the rest of it wipes up very well with cleaning wipes. It doesn't travel very well, but does collapse a bit for moving it."
3,Baby enjoys but jumper can cause injury to their hand & wrist,"This product has been really great overall with the exception that it injured my daughters hand & wrist. The yellow toy swings inward toward the baby but not outward and if they play with it just right then their little hand can get trapped and injured from them jumping up and down. I am posting a picture that illustrates this injury. Luckily I got to our daughter in time to remove her hand before any longterm damage was done. However, her hand and wrist was incredibly red and swollen (see picture that I am posting under product images... and the pics of her hand is AFTER the redness and swelling went down but I felt I should warn other parents and get some pics in case she has any problems with her hand). It's a great product and our daughter loves it but you must keep a close eye on your baby in case their hand gets trapped."
3,Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"The Pros-3 level height adjustment-firm base to prevent toppling over-easy installation-fairly entertaining-swivel for child to maneuver to different stationsThe Cons-the audio options can be pretty obnoxious fluctuating from monkey to elephant noise erratically. seems there is a triggering mechanism and there is no sensitivity adjustments. i haven't had the chance to take the battery out just yet.Closing statement:Mechanically sound, electronically needs some improvement"
4,Wonderful Invention!!!!,"This is one of my 3 1/2 month old baby girls favorite toys. Although at her age she can't reach a bunch of the stuff, she moves the jumperoo and makes the tunes play and gets a big kick out of it. I wish I would have had one of these for my son. I have no doubt she will love it until she grows out of it!!The only reason it got 4 stars is because the dragonfly toy does not stand up like it is supposed to. I don't know if I just got a bad one or what but it just falls over. It is not worth the hassle to send it back to get a new one though. She loves playing and looking at everything else. MONEY WELL SPENT!!!"
3,not bad for jumper,My son has used this quite a bit and really enjoys it...Would be better if it had more variety in music and more lighted objects but it serves its purpose and is very entertaining for my son.
4,Fun for a baby,It's really great except for the seat is a little snug on my 7 mo old. I wish I would have bought it sooner.
5,Love it,My 6 month old loves this jumperoo. She jumps like crazy in it and likes to play with the attached toys. Even if she's grumpy she enjoys playing in it. One thing to note though: she's on the tall side for her age and is just barely tall enough to have her toes reach the floor as they should. If you wanted to put a shorter baby in it I guess you could put a phone book or something under their feet. I'd definately recommend it.
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I was swayed by the reviews to buy the Jumperoo. It is a nice product, but my five month old son doesn't want to stay in it more than ten or fifteen minutes. The toys on it aren't engaging enough. He likes it, but it doesn't keep him busy so that Mommy can get other things done- as I'd hoped. Given the space it takes up and how little he uses it time wise, I wouldn't buy it again. I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't have almple room in their house to spare for toys that aren't used often."
2,DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE??,"Early Intervention/physical therapist says to limit babies usage to no more than 30 mins a day! Same goes for other Jumpers that hang from the door frame. Its not good for their legs.this is bulky and hard to move. The three posts shake and create lots of noise.Although they are a ""safe"" place to put child, while older kids are in room or have to run to the bathroom. I like the ""exersaucer"" style better."
2,Disappointed,After reading the reviews this seemed like a slam dunk great product for my baby. The problem is the seat sits up so high he can barely see the toys attached to the unit. The whole thing seems a little cramped. It was not easy for him to turn around either. The jumping was very very minimal and didn't entertain him. I guess I'm the outlier on this item.
5,I love Fisher-Price!!,"My 5 month old son loves this jumperoo! I was afraid he couldn't hold his head up enough, but he holds his head up just fine. Now he tries to stand up on my lap and he's trying to sit up on his own. So I think it's even helping his development. He loves it when the dog or cat walks into the room...he jumps even harder like he's trying to chase them. It's so nice to have something so entertaining that I can sit him in while I eat dinner or do some chores. And the way he sits in the seat, you know that he's safe. It was very easy to put together, only took about 15 minutes. I am a first time mom and I have to say I love Fisher-Price products!!"
5,Wonderful!,"The baby absolutely loves it! It's easy to assemble and easy to take from one room to another for me, but more importantly, my kiddo absolutely loves it and has since day one. There is so much to do, so much to play with, and so much to explore on this jumperoo. She's had it for a month and a half now and has not gotten tired of it. The longest she has stayed entertained (and happily so, with not even momentary bouts of frustration) in it so far has been an hour and a half. That's a lot of time I can use for other things. I am so glad we have this toy!"
5,Baby likes!,"I bought this for my five month old and she really likes it. She plays with most of the toys on it that are within her reach and the lights, sounds, and music fascinate her. I also like how easily she is able to turn around in it. It arrived in great codition and didn't take me long to figure out how to put it together. This is one of the best purchases of baby toys I have made. I would recommend this particular Fisher- Price Jumperoo over the others."
4,Plenty of goodies to entertain baby!,"Our little one loves her jumper. There are lots of colorful things to look at and captivate her mind! My only complaint is that although the height is adjustable, it is still too high for her little legs to reach the floor. We put a big pillow under her feet and she's good to go!"
4,Fabulous!,"This is a must for new parents. My son loves it and I do also.We got ours used and I purchased a new dragonfly, seat cover and bird for it, since I knew his mouth would be on these things (except the hanging bird) and it is just perfect and works like new.The only thing is that your child will want to jump all the time when you try to stand him up. :-)"
5,WELL worth the money!!,"My son got one of these from his great grandma as a ""nanny gift"" as she called it. (More just an excuse to give him stuff , lol) He was about 5 months old and even on the lowest setting, he couldn't reach the floor! So we put a book under his feet and he hasn't stopped jumping yet. He's 14 months old and still loves his ""Jumpy Jumpy"". It's also nice for those nights when Mommy has about lost her mind and can't seem to do anything right to get him to sleep. I just pop him in his ""Jumpy Jumpy"", and he rocks himself to sleep.I don't know what I would do with out it. He still loves it...and will be sad to see it go once he's out grown it.If you're thinking about getting one, think no more. This is a MUST have, not only for your child, but for your sanity as well!"
5,Fun for little busy ones,"My daughter has been able to hold her head up since day 1. She's constantly frustrated by not being able to do more than her body lets her. This jumper suits her needs perfectly. Sophie was born 1 month premature so she's on the smaller side. Her feet are still a ways from touching the floor while in this but she loves the activities, lights, and music. My only complaint is that the music does not go on for a longer period of time. Other than that, I highly recommend this to anyone!"
5,So much fun for my little one!,"Logan received his rainforest jumperoo for Christmas. He was only 3 months old at the time, but he loved it already! Now he is actually strong enough to jump around and turn the seat around to play with all of the toys. It gives me some much needed time to straighten up the house. The music and lights are awesome and it is so cute. The height adjustments are great so he'll be able to play in it for a while. Also, the top part with the leaves and the hanging parrot and frog are a nice touch. This is the best toy our son has and I'm soooo glad we bought it. (Oh, and I got ours at Wal Mart and it was only $69...you might want to buy it there!)"
4,Converted --- now a fan!,"I was very hesitant to buy a ""confining"" toy like this but I have been converted. For short periods of time, this is a great way to build baby's leg strength, get them used to being upright, and keep them entertained. It is really something to watch him discover the different toys on there and how he interacts with them. I still don't like these in general principle but I really see how he has learned from it."
4,Great with one tiny flaw,"This has been the best item yet. My daughter is 6 months old and has been using this for months now. She still loves it! Every time we bring it out she grins from ear to ear and kicks with excitement. She loves the toys, especially the parrot and frog hanging above her.The only flaw is that the dragon fly toy has eyes that are painted on. Since my daughter is now teething, I noticed that her teeth have scratched and removed part of the eyes. With all of the recalls as a result of lead paint, this was disappointing. I have no reason to believe there lead in the paint, however I still don't want my daughter to ingest it. I have removed the toy and she still enjoys it immensely.I highly recommend it keeping in mind to remove the toy once your child is teething."
5,Jumperoo is a big hit with our grandson!,"We bought the Jumperoo to keep at our house for our grandson after our daughter told us about it and how much he liked the one they had at their house. We knew we would be babysitting, so we went ahead and ordered it to keep at our house. It took about 15 minutes to put together. It is very sturdy and safe. The colorful toys keep him happy for a good, long time. The music is fun for him and we can control the volume and turn it off and on as we wish. The joy on his face when he is jumping up and down is priceless!"
5,A lifesaver!,"We purchased this for our 3-month-old son for Christmas, because he already liked to stand and loved kicking and jumping. And it is far and away one of our best purchases ever. Three months later, he loves his jumparoo even more. He'll easily play in it for 45 minutes to an hour, and still wants to keep jumping, even as he's falling asleep.Although our son was taller than average, his legs were still a bit too short to for him to use the jumparoo at 3 months. He was so excited to try it, though, so we put a few encyclopedias under his feet to prop him up. Problem solved."
4,Really worth the price,Really liked the product. My 7 month old daughter is really enjoying it!Should have brought this few months back.
5,Great jumper!,"After much research I decided to go with this popular jumper because I felt like it was a good price and not too overstimulating. I was right! My twins were 6 months old when we got this for them and love every second of it! At first they just like to spin the things that would make noise and watch the little beads go around but then they finally figured out the jumping. They love watching the lights go on, they love chewing on the polka dot toy, I like that they can spin around to see each other, me or look outside, It has been sturdy and my dtr loves to not only jump up and down but rock from side to side too! She just discovered the birds up above too and can almost reach them. It was super easy to assemble and has been an all around great product!"
4,Not for my baby,"I purchased this item for my 8 month old boy. Unfortunately, he is not the one who enjoys jumping a lot. The only time he jumps is when he sees someone approach him and thinks that he is going to be picked up. Also, my son is interested in the toys attached to the sides, but the seat is very tight and does not move around easily (even when he is not in it). This is probably a good product, but not for my baby."
4,"Entertaining, comfy for baby and fun",ProsLots of toys for baby without being too much stimulusGood support on cushionWashable cushionAdjustable height positionConsBulky even when in storage positionNeeds wheels to move out of the way easierHanging toys are out of reach of baby even on lowest settingElephant (not a rainforest toy) is turned the wrong wayShould have ability to add more toys later - one of the poles is uselessoverall my baby likes and there is no perfect activity jumper anyway
5,Rain Forest Jumparoo,"Got this for my four month old. Can't find anything wrong with it. Easy to put together and very cute. My daughter is small, so I just put something under her feet. Hasnt got the hang of jumping, but likes the toys. Everything was what I expected from all the other reviews."
5,so much fun,We love the Jumperoo. My 6 month old baby lit up when we put him in it. He jumps and jumps and play with all the fun toys around him. A few times I was taking him out he actually hang on the toys because he still wants to play. The only negative is that it's difficult to put him in and get him out because of the seat's small opening. It gets so much use more than his bouncy seat or swing.
3,still waiting....,"Not impressed. When first delivered, a part of the jumperoo was missing. No problem, I called Fisher Price and a week later got the missing base bar. The set up was easy. It was a lot wider than I imagined. Couldn't fit it through the doorway without folding it down. My child is on the smaller side, so we put a stool underneath his feet. He really only likes staying in there for about 5-8 mins before he gets bored. This is not a good buy for the real active kids. So... I am still waiting to see what the ""5 star rating"" is all about."
1,Buy Baby Einstein Instead.,"I bought this for my daughter and it was too high off the ground for her. She is in the 85th percentile for height, so I feel she should have been able to use it by 5 months and I was wrong. Perhaps for an older baby, this would work well. I bought the Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper instead, which has a lower level so she could easily reach the ground (It was easier to raise and lower, too). She loves the Baby Einstein one and I ended up selling this one on Craigslist."
1,The toys are so boring and it is too tall,My daughter barely lasted a minute in this thing before she was bored and begging to get out. She liked jumping but the toys weren't entertaining for her. She was an average height baby and she was too short when we first got it (when she was actually interested in bouncing) so we shoved a pillow underneath her so she could use it. As soon as she was actually tall enough for the second or third height level she didn't ever want to get in it because she could walk. I think they should skip the third setting and put one lower than the first setting so younger babies can use it more easily.
2,Rainforest JumperBOO,"I purchased this jumperoo for my son who was a little over 4 months at the time and he did not really care for it. Now that he is 6 months old, he has now learned that he needs to actually jump in it to make it fun (before he was just staring at the toys and I would bounce it manually). He can only be in it for about 20 minutes max before he starts to get bored. It takes up A LOT of room in our house and is a bit cumbersome to maneuver if you are relocating it elsewhere. In all, I do not think it was worth the $80 I paid for it. Next time, I will just purchase a walker instead."
2,not so good as expected,"my baby doesn't jump at all in it. but when she claps the toys, the music and light will work. so, she can get the ""stimulates"" even she doesn't jump. this is very disappointing."
1,True disappointment,"My son hates this thing. It was a Christmas present by request. My son is very physical at 5 months so I thought he'd really enjoy this. Boy was I wrong.First, the seat is tooooooo small. My son is average weight for 5 mos but taller than most babies. I feel like I have to cram him in compared to his exer-saucer.Second, the toys are crammed so close to the seat, his head is constantly downward which I think bothers him. In addition, it does not aid in reaching skills (hand-eye coordination).It is cute, nice colors, cute attachments. It had a lot of potential if they would have made it just a little wider.So we are back to our old exer-saucer and out the money/gift."
1,Buyer Beware,"Package arrived and looked suspicious from the start. Too many packing tapes surrounding the cover of the box made me feel that this box was already opened and used. My suspicion was right, opened up the box only to find scuff marks and wear and tear on the product. Will be returning and going brick and mortal for a peace of mind on this one."
5,Still going strong with 2nd baby,"Our first baby loved this, and now our second loves it even more. It stays in our kitchen where she can play while I cook / etc. She absolutely loves it. You will not regret this purchase."
5,Jumping for Joy,My granddaughter has it; she is seven months. Her toes touch the ground and she is off. Her performance is hilarious. Love the crazy music too. What a toy; a winner! Amuses but does not stress them.
5,"Colorful, fun distraction","I bought this used for my son when he was 3 months old. He wasn't into it AT ALL then, but at about 3.5 months, he started to really get into it. At 4 months, he adores it. I like that it's colorful and has music and sounds that respond to his bouncing. The negatives are that it's hard to put him in (his legs don't always go through the holes and it's hard to do by yourself), and it's very noisy when they really start to jump-- the whole thing rattles (and I don't mean toys).It's a great distraction-- I stick him in it when I need to do laundry or just want to have my hands free for a few minutes, but he doesn't really want to stay in it for longer than 15 minutes at a time."
4,Our baby loves his jumper!,"I have a six-month-old that has been ready for a jumper for about two months. He loves this jumper. It was relatively easy to put together, however the button holes on the seat were not matched up very well to the seat holder and the fabric doesn't have a whole lot of give for stretching. Garrett learned to spin around fairly quickly and is fascinated by the sun and lizard spinners. I would recommend this to a friend."
5,Your baby deserves this toy!,"This is the BEST toy in our house for our baby. He laughs and smiles the whole time he is in it, and he can last quite awhile in it too. If you are having a hard time deciding whether or not to get this product-JUST GET IT! You won't regret the purchase!"
3,Jumperoo,I purchased for my granddaughter and she seems to enjoy it..... .... .... .... .... ..... ..... .... .... ..
5,Happy Baby,Wonderful toy! Keeps baby happy for hours. Very cute and well constructed with a lot of interest for baby. I would recommend highly.
2,Watch out safety hazard,I am so sad to say that my five month old daughter was injured on this product. Her finger was pinched between the elephant and the support bar on the main activity area. I have contacted Fisher Price and they were absolutely wonderful. They are sending a prepaid shipping package to return it to the factory for inspection and are also sending us a credit for the full amount we paid for this item. I am also sad because this is my daughter's absolute hand's down FAVORITE ITEM. If not for this safety hazard I would give this item five stars. Fisher Price was so polite and kind I am sure they will look into this right away to try and solve this safety hazard.
5,Super fun!,"My 7 month old has had this for about 2 months now, and he loves this toy. It never gets old! Sometimes he tires himself out jumping, and falls asleep in it...which is adorable! I have also found that if he is really sleepy, and fighting going to sleep, I can put him in this and he is out within minutes, and I can take him out of it after he's been asleep for a few minutes and go put him in his bed without him waking up! He loves all the toys on it, especially both the parrots. He also loves it when I hold his legs up while he is in it, move him around in circles, and tell him he's in a flying saucer! =)"
3,Okay book,My son is a reader and he says that the story is not that great. He says it is a very good book if you want to improve upon vocabulary.
5,Excellent resource for college bound students,This copy of The Scarlet Letter is the complete version of the original novel. My daughter's AP teacher recommended that she use the Kaplan version because it references hundreds of SAT words that are used throughout the book. This book provides a pronunciation guide and definitions for the highlighted SAT words on the facing page. There is also an easy reference index at the back of the book. I recommend the Kaplan SAT experience for all college bound students.
4,Very good interactive DVD.,"This DVD was very good. I liked the story of the witches coming to Earth to train. The music is good, too. My only complaint is that two of the character don't have endings in it."
3,It's okay,"It's okay. I do like how they teach the colors and shapes, although the production value could be better for the price. It doesn't have an actual storyline, but it's a decent educational video. Unlike some I've seen, it's not confusing or unclear in anyway. The use of real kids is good, too. Helps hold my son's attention. He's two and doesn't ask for this video by name, but if I put it in, he usually watches. The colors section is the best I've seen so far."
1,I returned mine...,"My twins love the Baby Einstein series, but don't like ANY of the Brainy Baby videos (they were given to us as gifts and we returned EVERY ONE!) Very boring for kids, a nightmare for parents!"
5,Great find!,"This was the first of the Brainy Baby series DVDs I bought for my now 3 1/2 month old son. It hooked me. I like the series overall so much better than most Baby Einstein videos which many moms rave about (except I do like Neptune in that series). Anyway, this video is wonderfully perpared. It has vibrant uses of colors and shapes--using many children and creative ideas for every day items to show children shapes--such as a pizza slice for a triangle. Since children tend to want to watch the same video over and over--be sure to pick one you can stand too. This one is fun to watch for you and your children."
3,retro condiment caddy set,Didn't like how the salt and pepper didn't fit at all in their spots.. Had my husband make the opening bigger so they would fit. I would make sure the company who sends these out should check that every thing fits in their spots before sending... I had order two of them and both where the same way.
2,Problematic Treadmill- Horrible Customer Service,"After reviewing this treadmill in Consumer Reports- we decided to purchase this- and it arrived on March 1st. This treadmill has been making 'squeeking' noises since the very start when it is on any incline higher than 1.5. I have contacted Customer Service- my husband (who is very mechanical) worked on it for over two hours with no resolution and now I am waiting for them to have a ""service tech"" call me- who is now two days past the date they told me I could expect a call. If this squeek was not an issue, I would be very happy with the treadmill. It runs well and is easy to use- and I would rate it highly. However, as it is defective and no-one at Ironman seems to care to resolve the issue, it is very frusterating."
1,This has been a nightmare.,"The treadmill worked great for about five months and then the motor started smoking. Customer service sent me a replacement motor and within 2 days it started smoking again. I called three weeks ago and they said they were sending a service technician...they never came. I called again. They said it was a glitch and that they would put in another repair order and I would hear from the repair man within three days...I never heard back and they never came. I called for a third time, once again they said there was a glitch in the work order. They said they called the repair man and he would call me that same day to set up a time for service...the call never came. I am going to call back on Monday but I bet the same thing will happen. I will never buy another Keys Fitness product again. The treadmill isn't well built and the customer service is a disaster. Please do yourself a favor and buy another treadmill."
5,Ironman 320t Heart Rate Interactive Programmable Treadmill,"I am very pleased with my treadmill which I recieved January,2007. It is a high end treadmill and was one of the ones recommended in a recent Consumers Reports. The price was decent and weighed less than some of the other ones recommended. You will need two strong people to lift and/or slide the box. It weighs approximately 232 pounds. But once it is together it can be rolled to another area in the folded position. The assembly instructions were pretty straight forward. Everything went together nicely. I am a fairly handy female. I think it helps to lay out the parts, so as not to put the wrong screws in place and then have to go back and change them. One thing I would strongly recommend would be to go on the [...] and download the Users Manual and read it before it arrives. I did this and when it came I already knew what to expect. Hopes this helps."
4,So far so good,"We've only had this for a few weeks now. It works well, does everything a treadmill is supposed to do, seems to be built well and was priced very reasonably compared to other new treadmills for sale. Only minor complaint: The Chassis is a little bit squeeky at certain positions on the tread."
1,Big waste of money - electrical problems from the biginning,"We've had electrical problems from the beginning. The last time it was functional, my husband turned on the fan and it turned itself off - as if someone pulled the plug. Then we got the SI1 error - as if the safety strap had been removed, but hadn't been. Now we don't even get the SI1 error and nothing happens when you turn it on. And, no one will fix them, now that Keys is out of business. They say that it's our loss! Funny, though... Dick's Sporting Goods replace their customer's with another model. Hmmmm... No more Play it Again Sport for us!!!! And definitely, no more Ironman!!!!"
3,Well produced but this is still MUSAK!,"This is a well-produced CD but be forewarned it is not by the original artists (as I had expected). This is elevator, doctor's office, Nordstrom's material so don't expect a classic 90's retrospective..."
5,"Emotion, the perfect title......","Juice really delivered with this project. I honestly like every track on this cd. ""First time caller"" is a perfect mid tempo single. Other standout tracks: Old bye and bye, Deborah Allens ""If I didn't love you"" (should have been a huge hit for Juice). Til you cry (one of my all time favorite tracks) Someone believed,etc.... Unfortunately the album only produced one top 10 hit in the single ""Tell me True"". There were definitely many other great tracks to choose from. This album is my second favorite Juice album. Purchase this cd... Well worth your time."
2,Once on the bar it works ok,"Very difficult to insert and remove them compared to the straight clips that I have. If you are doing time based training and require rapid change of weights, these clips are not very good."
3,For Those who love one piece,For those who love one piece but think the price here is rediculous im here to save the day On 3/13/2011 for $30 you will be able to get One Piece Collection 5 which is Season 2 5th and 6th voyage all in one box.One Piece: Collection Five
1,low-calorie,Lightweight. Sort of silly. Author is a slave to PC trendiness. Can't believe the august Schelisnger is associated with this thing.
1,Another Deplorable Biography on Thomas Jefferson,"Here it is again! Another typically deplorable biography on Thomas Jefferson from another PC historian. What a shame that the American History ""profession"" has once again provided us with a biased, politically correct, and slander ridden assault on the personage of Thomas Jefferson. Joyce Appleby spends more time bashing him for his views on women, indians,and slaves that you really never see the great human being who wrote the Declaration of Independence. All the typical left-wing anti-white male PC ad hominem attacks are there. I personally would not waste another dime on a book by Appleby, but if one wants a book that once again trashes an American hero, buy this one!"
2,A Repeat,"Well written but gets boring reading the same old rehash warmed over with a different person's opinions. Nothing new here, I'm afraid, just a repeat."
5,First of its kind.,"This is truly a ground-breaking work: the first time anyone has written a scholarly book about the Olympic arts competitions. As such, it is painstakingly thorough, reflective, and demonstrates a fine command of sources in English and other languages. It is a truly heroic undertaking, and should be met with kudos from anyone interested in the Olympic experience."
5,For Actors Only,"It's very important to understand that this book, like the others in the series, is exactly what it says - a workbook. There is little or nothing to be gained from just reading it, apart from an idea of how the Sandy Meisner approach works in terms of practical exercises. And 'exercises' is the key word. Larry Silverberg intends that you should take this book, find an acting partner and carry out the exercises within in the times specified.It's all in there for beginners and seasoned actors alike, and assumes that the student is coming new to the subject. Silverberg knows his Meisner. Bear in mind ,though, that the book is not a substitute for the teacher. There is no-one to monitor what you do or the progress you make and in the Meisner technique that becomes essential the deeper you go.Having said that, in the absence of anything else, these workbooks are a great way to practice what I believe to be the finest training technique available to the modern actor."
2,Fuzzy Foto,"The poster paper is heavy, high quality stuff. The image quality is poor: fuzzy. Why would anyone waste such good paper on such a fuzzy image? I found a clearer image of this photo on the internet and am sorry I wasted my money on this poster."
4,Great stocking stuffer!,"This bill boards are small, but perfect size for a shirt. You can program in your message and wear it for all to see. I got this to go in the kids stockings at Christmas, I think they will be great for school sporting events - GO TEAM. WE'RE NUMBER 1, etc. I think these will be a big hit!"
4,"A clever toy, but instructions are lacking",This is a very cute and clever gadget (people want one when they see mine) and can be used frequently because you can program it to say different things. However the directions are a bit sketchy. They do not tell you how to make the message scroll after you program in the message(hold down the set button)or how to attach it to your clothes (pull metal strip off and place inside clothing). It is quite easy to program and attracts a lot of attention. Mindless fun for older children and adults.
3,Chilling,I laughed. I cried. I cringed. The writing was amazing. I can't say the same for the director.
4,Jennifer Tilly at her comedic best,This is a great black comedy and a must see for Jennifer Tilly fans.
5,"Listen, you can hear the heartbeat...","What starts off as a typical crime drama quickly turns into a well written black comedy. The entire cast walks the fine line between acting and insanity with precision. The characters could have been two dimensional cut-outs but Hannah, Gallo and Tilly breathe a creepy life into their creations without taking away either their edge or their humanity. Jennifer Tilly proves once again why she is an actress of the highest order. If there was any justice in the world, she would have the box-office power of Julia Roberts. This is not for those who are easily offended by graphic images, but take a chance, you might just learn something about yourself (but for society's sake, I hope not)."
3,hide and seek,"I saw this film Hide and Seek on Sky Movies here in the UK and i've got to say it is one of the most disturbing films i've ever seen.I can tell you now, i don't shock easily but this film is truely horrific.if you're in to sick and twisted plots buy it, just don't show the kids!...p.s don't watch it at 3am either! Rating 6/10 just for shock value"
5,Horrid thriller!,"The generated anguish for having a baby, will make a couple break the rules of the ethic or sanity, to get by all their means, this goal. And their immediate objective will be to kidnap a woman at the eve of become a mother, in order to steal her expected creature.A sensible and awful drama that will not let you disappoint you. Sidney Furie directing , Jennifer Tilly and George Gallo as the desperate couple and Daryl Hanah as the kidnapped pregnant work out in superlative grade."
5,Impressed,"This is a thick solid steel plate and the welds are very nice. Extremely stable with one or eight olympic bars. Contemplated making one of these myself because they are not cheap, but glad I purchased this one. It was actually one of the lower priced one's I looked at and I am sure quality does not get any better than this regardless of the price. Nice having my bars off the floor."
2,Look closely at the bottom of the cell before opening package,"I say you should look closely at the bottom of the cell before opening the package because the one I got from Amazon/Micro-Tools was heavily encrusted with corrosion on arrival. It was not apparent until I opened the blister pack.When I did, it was apparent the entire plastic cup that holds the battery was filled with corrosion foo.Ah well, it was only $5.95. I'll see if Amazon takes it back. I wouldn't blame them if they don't, the package being opened and all.That's why I say, look closely at the bottom of the cell before opening package.So why two stars and not one? Because I ordered another one, and it looks ok.P.S. In case you're curious, I use this battery in my Olympus 35 RC and in my Yashica Lynx 14."
1,Only worth it for the oring adapter,"The quality of these has worsened significantly in the past year. I've opened up quite a few and found them pushing out only 1.2v or less which can over expose your images. My suggestion to the new classic camera user is to buy one of these, use it if you can, and then use a hammer to knock the dead cell out of the the o-ring it's encased in. You can then slip a really cheap 675 zinc air battery in it which is 1.35v. You can get 60 of them for $15 on Amazon so do the math."
5,Exactly What They are Supposed to Be,"I'm glad I found out about these, now I can shoot my Minolta SRT-101 the way it was designed to be. These are reliable and the right voltage - no need to make adjustments in your head."
2,Look at battery before opening packaging.,"After opening the packaging I found that the battery was missing part of it's casing. Sent it back and received a prompt, no hassle refund. It does say to rate the product and that is what I will do. Appropriately, I can't give more than two stars for the product but I would give five stars to Amazon for their service after the sale."
4,Revised Review of WeinCell MRB625,"The first battery I ordered for my Yashica Mat 124G was dead on arrival. I returned it and ordered a new one. The new one works well and the camera meter is now happy. The individual battery rates 5 stars, but I only awarded 4 stars because of the problem with the first order."
1,"WARNING---Good idea, but poorly executed by mfg.","Was excited to find out that I could still power my vintage Nikon Ftn camera, but discovered these Wein batteries barely caused the voltage tester to budge. Followed the instructions about removing the tab and waiting..... how does 24 hrs. sound? Next time I'll look at buyer's reviews before purchasing, as several commented about receiving DEAD BATTERIES from this vendor. Either they have had these on their shelves for years or there's a basic design defect. Either way.... be warned!"
2,Came corroded and half dead.,"After cleaning it up with a small wire brush voltage tested at 0.97, that's only a 72% charge. It did power up my light meter in my camera though and I had a shoot to do, so I had to go ahead and use it, but not happily. These batteries are just so dang hard to find."
2,Batteries,"I have a light meter that uses an obcure 1.35v px13 battery. I found it at Wein Cell. I ordered two as the unit requires two to operate. Unfortunately one of the first two batteries was corroded in the package. They sent a replacment immediately and it too was corroded. The blister packs are clear and if you look, you can see grey fuzzy corrosion on the batteries. So after several weeks, my light meter is still inop. Sending the two corroded ones back as requested and waiting for another replacement.Their attentino to this problem so far has been fine. Just drawn out now."
4,WATCH OUT FOR THE POSTAGE!,"I've used the Wein Cell battery for several years now in my old Canon FTb, and it works great. That said, $18.39 was STANDARD postage on 3 batteries, bringing the total to $34.14 (7% tax is applied to both item and shipping). Something to consider for future orders. This is the only reason for 4 stars out of 5."
2,Not fresh,I ordered batteries for my 40 year old Nikon cameras. These batteries do not seem to be fresh as the camera tester is on the negative side. My last battery order was fine.
3,Works in SRT-101,"It works. Yippee for that that. But, I can't help but note that I'm on my third battery within 4 yrs., where the old mercury batteries seemingly lasted forever."
4,Works well in an old Nikon Ftn with add on meter,The batteries work well in a Nikon Ftn. There were some complaints listed about dead or weak batteries but that was not the case with the ones I received.
2,nice puzzle,nice puzzle and easy to do but it was missing 2 corner pieces. which led to dissapointment when i was done with it.
2,minolta 300l,Very disappointed in this camera. It does not have mid-roll change and the flash is very weak and it does not cover the entire zoom range. Most of the pictures taken indoor using the zoom lenses came out very dark. Picture quality for outdoor day time shots came out decent.
2,Implausible and Disappointing,"Having recently read ""Waterland"" and ""Last Orders""--both of which I found to be deeply moving--I was really looking forward to reading Swift's newest novel. Unfortunately, ""The Light of Day"" is not nearly in the same class as those other two. While I applaud the author for the attempt to stretch his work in a new direction, the gritty and hard-boiled world he tries to create here is just not believable. In particular, I found the main protagonist's (i.e., George, the defrocked cop turned private detective) obsession and devotion to his murderess client to be completely implausible. There really was nothing developed in the story about their relationship that justifies George's behavior, either during the book's catalyzing event or over the subsequent two years. Without even trying to establish why such passion and conviction might exist in the face of all reason, the novel came across to me as a soulless collection of literary devices."
4,wonderland,"More dazzling writing and thinking from Swift, who would have earned five stars for this had he not written Waterland, still his best book. Not since another Graham -- Greene -- has there been a writer to write such beautiful, wonderful, thought-provoking sentences -- especially to end chapters. And his ability to connect seemingly disparate thoughts and occurences and motives is unrivaled.For my money, Swift is the greatest living English novelist. And only One Hundred Years of Solitude is a more impressive novel than Waterland."
2,Much too long,"Though there is an occasionally beautiful image or turn of phrase, this book is definitely not worth the time or money. It is the literary equivalent of picking a scab. There is little plot here, certainly not enough to justify 300 pages. The narrator circles around and rehashes the same events over and over and over and over again. 2/3 of the way through, it became clear that there would be no more ""revelations,"" so the last 1/3 was simply maddening. Not to mention that the lack of linearity and the pretentious literary style are simply inappropriate for the narrator: George Webb, ill-educated, womanizing private detective (gourmet chef and passionate devotee to Sarah Nash though he may be) would NEVER express himself like this. I recommend choosing something else."
2,Don't listen to the critics,"I don't know what book the critics read but it wasn't this one.The reader reviews by ""Jeffrey N Hobbs"" and ""James Chaffee"" are dead on. This book seems to be more about the author's writing style than anything else. Rather than enhancing the story, the writing style just gets in the way. I could understand the lack of plot if there was character development but there's very little of that either. The book revolves around George's very extreme actions because of his love for Sarah, but the few interactions George has with Sarah aren't enough to make his actions believable. Harry Potter has more psychological insights than this book."
4,It works!,"I have some doubt on how this lasre guide would work. But being a tool nut, I couldn't resist and bought one for my Delta 10"" radial arm saw. Installation was very easy. It took much more time to take off the blade shield of the saw than to actually install it. Once installed, turning on the saw turns on the laser. It provides a bright red line on the saw table and it is accurate! I don't know how much I really need this, but the red laser line does provide sort of a warning to any stray fingers that might wander into the saw blade's path."
5,Must have item,"I have two of these in my wood shop, on two different saws. They work great and makes it much easier to set up a cut."
1,Not so nice,already had one of these laser guides on my miter saw. I have found it to be a huge help making accurate cuts. So I bought one for my radial arm saw and I'm not sorry. You can put your pencil mark anywhere on the board and pick it up. Great tool for 21 bucks.Update: worked well until I had to change the Batteries at this point one of the contacts fell out rendering it useless.
1,Quitting Quicken!,"The changes Intuit has made to what was ONCE a useful product, are TOO MUCH! The WORST, to me, is that much of my 15 years of investment data became inaccessable after I converted. Am not sure, but think the program refuses to access old, inactive investment accounts.Do not KNOW, because I simply kept the old program (Q2000) and data! No apologies - the company always claimed to be intuitive and user-friendly; for over a decade, it WAS friendly enough, even when I had to start using ZIP disks to back up. It isn't friendly any more, though.I've spent untold hours recording all my financial information since 1991, including those inactive investment accounts. Quicken 2000 will simply have to keep me going; had meant to upgrade earlier years ago, but am no longer sorry. Read the reviews of Quicken 2003-onward - enough said."
1,Worthless,"I bought this product mostly to manage my portfolio. I have never worked with a more poorly designed product. It was absolutely unbelievable.I installed it, spent two days populating it with data, spent three days trying to figure out why it kept pulling down the wrong quote prices; why I couldn't get it to properly record complex dividend transactions; why it kept telling me that there was an error updating my online portfolio; etc. Finally I spent five beautiful minutes uninstalling this joke of a product. I just wish it wasn't too late to return it. Oh, and you get to be constantly prompted by ads even though you just spent $90 with them.Save your money -- this product is garbage, has always been garbage, and will likely always be garbage. I hope they go out of business."
1,Utter Garbage,"Pity the poor unsupecting user who ""upgrades"" to this bloated pile of trash. The already shaky download system in 2004 (all the way back to 2001, for that matter) has been totally destroyed by Intuit's discontinuation of the QIF file. I spent hours trying to get my transactions to download with no luck. After many reinstallations (even purging my system registry of anything Quicken) I threw in the towel and went back to 2004. Not for long though, MS Money is in the mail..."
1,Sprawling ad for other Intuit products,"I purchased this as a tool to track my consulting business revenue and expenses, particularly to track expenses for income taxes. It's useless.This application's far too many features are arranged in an unintuitive and illogical format. For example, the Vehicle Mileage Tracker (which I would use frequently) shares a pull-down menu with occasional use tools (e.g., a business plan creator and a guide to starting a small business) as well as plenty of items that link to opportunities to buy other Intuit products. Worse, while main features are buried away, ads for QuickBooks, a Quicken MasterCard and Quicken BillPay prominently and unalterably litter the screen. The features I need do not share data; entering the simplest transactions is an unwieldy chore.I have not tried and cannot comment on the usefulness of the program's investment and tax planning tools. However, I consider this application terrible as a business management tool. Intuit should be ashamed."
1,Breaks TurboTax and QuickBooks,"I am a 6 year user of Quicken, QuickBooks and longer than that on TurboTax. This year I just installed Quicken 2005 and it broke the installs of Quickbooks AND TurboTax 2004. I had just installed TurboTax two weeks ago and was in the middle of doing my return. This is TOTALLY UNACCAPTABLE for a product to break the install of the company's other products. It is unbelievable. I then checked with another friend and the same thing had happened to him. I went online and then found a number of people had this problem. There is NOTHING about this on Intuit's site. Apparently they are so big they feel they can act like Microsoft now."
1,"Same Bugs, Fewer Features",I have been a Quicken user for about 10 years. This upgrade is the worst yet. The upgrade procedure destroyed my Turbotax installation. The same bugs are still there and downloading from many institutions doesn't work any more. The business features are basically useless. You can't even put a description column in an invoice.
4,Not so bad,"Having read all the bad reviews and forced to upgrade from Q2002, I had to take the leap in order to continue with my porfolio dounloads and mgt. I knew I didn't want MS Money from an earlier try about 2 yrs ago. Anyway, I use it for checkbook entries/family expense management and investments/portfolio management. It converted everything from Q2002 without a hitch and I haven't had any problems. Unlike some other problem areas, I do not use the bill pay portion of Quicken. I can't download my bank transactions since they still use QIF, but I knew this ahead of time from all the Amazon reviews. In order to get the same functions as Q2002 deluxe, I had to get the Premier Home and Business. One of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head regarding the underhanded way Intuit tries to get our money. I just wish there was another competitor other than MS Money.....maybe there will be soon."
2,It has bugs,"There are problems when making payments to vendors. If I select ""print check"" it will NOT show up in check writing section unless I give it a check number, save it, then put it back to print again. You also have to re-click on values several times to get credit updates to sync. I've gotten so used to it I do it automatically, but these are basic things that should have been worked out."
2,I should rate it ONE,"I've used Quicken for years and Bragged that I write all my checks with the program. Then I got 2005, and my bank got bought out. Now, I've jumped through all the hoops, called both Quicken and my bank, been to my bank twice personally, and can't get sny psssword to work that will satisy both Quicken and the bank. (They use different ones.) It looks like I'm going to have to go back to paper checks.Still not solved, and to say I'm frustrated is the understatement of the year. Try ro find ""customer support.""I wish I could get them on the same page. I could dictate a password. They want you to change passwords frequently!! HOW, for God's sake!"
2,This program is very very bad,I have used Quicken for a number of years. I have noticed that is has actually gotten worse with each year. This latest upgrade has locked me out of my previous accounts that worked under 2004. What am I supposed to do? Spend 20 hours trying to iron out the bugs? Heck no. I am switching to Microsoft and never looking back.Quicken has lost one customer for life. Please do yourself a favor and do not buy this product. There are much better alternatives.
1,Should get minus 5 stars...,"...but that option wasn't available. Sure wish I read these reviews before throwing $90 down the tubes. What awful software! Intuit managed to throw out what works and showcase the nonfunctional. I've used Quickin for more then 10 years, but now it's goodbye forever to those shysters."
1,Intuit has destroyed Quicken,"The reviewers that give this buggy product one star are absolutely correct. The greedy execs at Intuit have removed .qif support, so they can force banks and credit unions to pay a fee to them (my credit union refuses to do this, so no more importing of data there), sent their call centers/chat rooms to India, providing cheap, worthless support (complain loudly to these people via e-mail that you are fed up with jobs being sent overseas), and splattered ads all over the place to get more of your dollars to buy other Intuit products that will likely not work too well. One Step Update has never worked properly.The only people benefitting are execs at Intuit, who make millions laying off countless workers here in the USA for crappy offshore support.I am trialing Money 2006 and will probably switch over to that product."
4,Great features,"Great features, hard to find it in a retail store. Good price. Protrek and Pathfinder are the same, in the watch is written pathfinder no protrek. protrek is the brand for latinamerica."
4,It's a jumprope,"It's a jumprope...not much to say - works good when I use it! If only it did the jump roping for me, now we'd be talking :-)"
1,TOO LIGHT FOR SPEED,"i am purchasing a different rope today because this one does not allow for speed. if you like jumping slowly or whipping your arms really hard, this is the rope for you. but I do not enjoy it for doing fast jumps to warm up before a run. the connection is metal loop to metal loop, and squeeks a little between swings, which I also do not like."
1,Weak Design,"My roommate bought us each one of these, because they were on sale (not on amazon). I didn't like how the handles were made because you can't choke up on the rope to make it shorter (as she is very short). We tried tying a couple knots in the rope, but she was over it. I'm 5'6"" and it was still a little too long for me. I made it work anyway.When I was actually using it, the hinges on the handles wouldn't turn every time, so the rope would get twisted. Every 45 seconds to a minute of jumping, I'd have to stop and untwist it. And then after a combined usage of maybe 15 minute, the hinges completely broke off the handle. My roommate let me use hers, and it had the same issues. It didn't take too long to break that one too.We hadn't really thought to take them back, because the were on sale for super cheap (huh, wonder why), but I was perusing for a new jump rope and saw this, definitely not worth your money or annoyance."
2,"For play, not for work","Not a very good jump rope for exercise. First off its fairly short. Not a problem for me, but I'm only 5'7"". Anyone above the six foot mark will probably have trouble using it. My main problem with it is how light the rope itself is. Its very difficult to get this thing up to speed, which made it feel more like I was doing an arm exercise instead of cardio. That said, I guess it wouldn't be a bad ""recreational"" jump rope on a playground or something. Its fairly well constructed."
3,good enough,"this was good enough for the purposes i bought it for, it is a little long for me but i still manage to use it"
3,Just a jump rope!,"I got this today & was happy with it. However, I didn't like the metal links because they make a sound when skipping..The handles were nice, but the rope material wasn't that good...I think I paid a little too much for a plain jump rope with middle quality.."
2,"Makes ""clinking"" noise every time you jump","Pros:1) Looks pretty--has a ""classic"" jump rope look.2) Handles are comfortable3) Can simply tie knots in the rope at the handle to adjust lengthCons:1) The metal clasps that connect the handle to the rope ""clink"" against each other every time you move the jump rope. This means every time you jump you will hear a noise of the metal hitting metal.2) If you use this jump rope outside the white rope will quickly get dirty.I will be purchasing the Valeo Deluxe Speed Jump Rope. It is comparable in price, easily washable, and has special ball-bearings that allow for smooth, noiseless movement."
2,Disappointed,"I'm not as fond of this book as Larson's original one. The editor tampered with the material, trying to contemporize it by removing the reliance upon a Great Creator or Higher Power, something higher than ourselves. Instead, it advances the individual into that position. As such, I think it lacks the heart and power of Larson. While this may work for a few. However, because the transformations must occur at the subconscious level (psychic change), I doubt that most people can pull that off themselves."
3,Great music. Slow ship and broken case.,"I love The Corries!!! I have their music in CD form. I also have it in my Ipod which I listen to at home and in the car. The first CD I ordered had no problems. Therefore, I had no hesitation ordering this one for my birthday.I don't know whether going through international customs caused the time delay, followed by some elephant sitting on it at the post office, or what the heck happened. What I do know is it arrived 2 weeks later than promised and with a broken CD case. Fortunately the CD itself was fine! When you're shuffling CDs in and out of their cases in the car, a broken one is really a pain. Too bad I can't personally accompany the next CD I order on it's trek from the UK to the US to ensure it's safe travel.In terms of the music, this was a great collection of songs. I enjoy listening to it daily. Their harmony and traditional instruments are addicting."
4,John Adams (The American President),"I found this book very concise and informational. It is an excellent overview of his Presidency without getting deeply into all issue's. I found many items out which I was not previously aware of after reading this book. I deigned that your acquisitive nature will be rapt within the pages of this book. I only caution that I found myself going to the dictionary frequently in regards to wording used to describe the situations. Overall, though, this book met and exceeded my expectations."
3,"A decent overview of his ideas, theories, and presidential policies.",This isn't much of a biography. It gives just a quick history of Mr. Adams early life. It mainly focuses on his political and philosophical career and his feuds with Jefferson and Hamilton. It does a good job of reviewing his term as second president and the policies and precedents he initiated. This book may be a stepping stone to a more comprehensive analysis of Mr. Adams's personal and political life.
1,"cover is great, but the shipping cost from J-Life is exorbitant","The cover is great, but to pay $7.65 ($1.90 postage on envelope) to ship a $9.99 item, makes the seat NOT great. I was desperate to give this to an old old woman who needs it and will love it, but I won't pay those robbers for another one. If you can find a cheaper dealer, buy it. But DO NOT buy from J-Life"
3,OK But need to be considered semi-disposable,"Fit toilet seat well, comfy, but holes in the fabric appeared after just two washings. I wish the fabric was a little more substantial."
5,Dragon Puzzle,My son loves dragons. This is the most beautiful dragon puzzle that I have ever seen. It is awesome!
4,Very Helpful,After just taking this product for over a week I did notice a difference in my overall well being. It has helped with a couple of health issues I have been dealing with over the past year.
4,Okay,"This is a good product and really works when I remember to take it. However, it is difficult to remember to take multiple times a day."
2,Gave me a headache!,"I was really hopefull that this product would be helpful... each time I took it, I ended up with a headache. So disappointed!"
4,Another Wonderful Haba Toy,"Another well-made Haba toy! The goblins are adorable, and each makes a different sound. This is a wonderful alternative to plastic pull toys."
4,What a challenge!,"My husband and I ordered this puzzle. It looked interesting having a mystery story and two puzzles to complete to find the clue. The biggest drawback to this puzzle is all the pieces for both puzzles are blended together and both puzzles like just alike except with a few differences, so it took a while of shifting pieces from one puzzle to another to figure it all out, plus the extra challenge is putting it together without any picture to go by. After 3 weeks, we finally finished it! This was fun, but it takes alot of concentration and patience to complete."
5,puzzle lovers paradise!,"This puzzle is 2 puzzles in one. A before and after picture. You need to read the story, put the two puzzles together and then solve the mystery! The trouble is... the puzzles are both in the same bag. It took 4 adults about 5 days to get this all put together. It was such fun that we all decided that we need to get more of the alphabet puzzles as a list came with the puzzle."
3,Good Puzzle Craftsmanship; Flawed Mystery,"I thought the puzzle was crafted beautifully. The pieces fit together nicely and its challenging without being impossible. And there seemed to be a ton of interesting clues based on the before/after puzzles.But, and I'm not giving anything away, the solution to the mystery was quite disappointing. It was quite simplistic, and most of all, *flimsy.*This next bit of information might seem like it's a spoiler, but I'm wording it to avoid spoiling the mystery (though, like I said, I think the solution is disappointing): Most of all, the mystery ignores a very widely known bit of information about the relationship between dogs and chocolate; you'd think a puzzle with chocolate in the title would be aware of this fundamental thing that any dog owner (or someone who owns a dog) would know...strange...Again, it's a perfectly good puzzle, but I love the mystery element of these puzzles and that part was a letdown."
4,Muy Bueno,"I am a hispanic mother married to an american. I am the only source of Spanish in my household and it is very important to me that my baby learns Spanish. My 18 month old baby has been watching this DVD for about a month now. She sits and watches without interruption for most of the DVD. She really likes it and it's bearable for me to watch with her. Some of the words in the Maria tenia un Corderito song are not pronounced correctly. Also, they use the word Creyón (crayon) which does not appear in the dictionary of the Real Academia Española. My baby seems to like this DVD much better than Cantarima's Numeros y Figuras. This DVD's length is much better than Cantarima. I would recommend and give Brainy Baby - Spanish as a gift."
2,For older children,"Bought this for my 18 month old. He has no interest, would rather watch Plaza Sesamo (sesame street) or the Cantarima series. This is toward older children I assume."
4,Excellent dvd for baby!,"For those of you who want a bilingual child, starting early is the best way to achieve success. Brainy Baby is a great place to start!"
3,Seems good but can't say for sure,I bought this for my 21 month old daughter. She is in a bilingual class once a week with Boca Beth materials but this DVD got better reviews so I bought this one. She likes it but only for about 20 mins and then she asks to watch something else. Her attention span at the class is short too - maybe too much new stuff at once??
2,Just OK,I bought this video for my soon to be three year old. She speaks and understands Spanish already I just purchased this more as a reinforcement. This would be perfect to introduce a child to Spanish but was a little too basic for her. The pictures were somewhat boring and dated. I was grossed out by the dirty feet and long toe nails. I'm weird about feet so that was not one of my favorite parts.
2,Brainy Baby - Spanish - Not For Musicians,"Unless you're tone deaf, you'll want to avoid this one. The string quartet that plays on the soundtrack is so out of tune that I could not even tolerate one complete playing of the video. Aside from that I guess it's fine, thus the 2 stars. We also bought Brainy Baby - Right Brain, which is much better. I'd give it 3 or 4 stars. Our favorite learning video thus far is Baby Van Gogh by baby einstein. Baby Shakespeare is 2nd."
2,Baby loves....123 Cuéntame un cuento,"We are a hispanic family living in the US. When my baby was born, I received this DVD as a present, together with another one called 123 Cuéntame un cuento. My baby likes Brany Baby... but he LOVES 123 Cuéntame un Cuento. 123 Cuentame un Cuento"
3,Pretty good video,"I bought this video for my two year old. Although it does teach a lot of spanish words it is not entertaining enough to keep her attention,she tends to wonder of and do something else, it is lacking color and imagination, the music is not that great either. I suggest you try ""Rayitos Del Saber - Las Formas"", they only have this one video so far but it is very lively, it has great puppets segments and the music is great. It'll keep your child entertained while it teaches him/her Spanish."
2,This video was boring,"My two year old did not find this video entertaining at all. With other videos such as baby einstein or blues clues he pays attention to what is going on, talks to the television, and so on. This video wasn't able to hold his attention for 2 minutes. The video has a lot of potential. I liked the way they did the counting and how they have only speak in spanish but the english words are in the corner for the parents. The best part of the DVD was the music video for Mary Had a Little Lamb; but they only had that one song. Maybe if they had incorporated more of this technique the video would have been more interesting."
5,Wonderful learning tool,"GREAT video for teaching your child the most common Spanish words. My daughter also loves ""Brainy Baby - English"". My only wish is that the company would have one video with the option of choosing which language you want to hear it in just as the Baby Einstein series does. Both Brainy Baby videos (English and Spanish) show the exact same footage but just with a different language. The company is out to get our money by getting us to buy two videos instead of one on the same topic - common words. Shame on them!"
4,Great Video!,I got this for my Niece. Its a great little video for getting off on the right foot. And good for parents who want to learn a little Spanish in the process.Jabu Studio
2,My Little Boy was Bored,"I tried this with my little boy but he was so bored. He's not against educational videos and loves his Leap Frog and Sesame Street videos, but this just didn't catch and hold his attention."
3,Not bad,This is a pretty good video for babies - there are a lot of words introduced and nice visuals to go with the words. I bought it for my almost 3 year old and it is a little below his level. Probably better for a younger child.
3,Not that Good,"So I have Bilingual Baby already and this DVD is almost exactly the same. So it didn't add any value to my 2 year old son. Also, the best way to teach kids spanish is to immerse them in the music, visuals and language and this video doesn't do that. In fact none of the United States based videos do. I highly recommend you try videos that come from Hispanic countries instead. Much more visually impactful. Try ""Los Rayos""."
4,"Good quality, it's entertaining, some words are not good","My first language is Spanish and I got this DVD for my daughter so she can learn more Spanish. The first time she watch it, she didn't care (she was under 1 year). Now that she is older she LOVE IT!! She doesn't move her eyes from the TV.The Spanish is good, it uses some words that we don't use frequently for some objects (like ""bola"" for ball) but I can live with that. There is only one word that I think the translation is wrong: ""Creyones"" I never heard that. We use Crayones o Crayolas but not ""Creyones""Other than that, the video is good, has good content and good pronunciation."
2,boring and slow,"I bought this dvd for my 2 year old niece. Although she seemed to enjoy it, I don't believe she retained anything from this (and we speak Spanish). And it was annoying for everyone else. Its basically just seeing the shot of an image and hearing the word pronounced. Save your money and buy a book of basic vocabulary"
4,good video for a toddler and an infant,"My two year old and my 7 month like the video. The words are basic and are repeated enough so my two year old is able to follow with no problem. My toddler enjoys the video and I noticed that she is starting to repeat what is said in the video. Also she started using the sentences from the video on actual conversation such as pointing to the clouds and saying ""Nubes blancas""."
3,Good but not great,"My kids like this video, I don't love it, but it keeps them entertained for a short time. I do think Brainy Baby could have done a higher quality level of production for all their success."
3,Brainy Baby (Spanish),"I spent this summer attempting to teach my daughter spanish. This movie is an excellent way to introduce and increase spanish vocabulary. The spanish words use action and images to assist with making a connection with the word. The movie use a variety of pictures and images to make connection with the words. The movie, also, includes basic every day sentences that could be use for basic conversations. My toddler is not really interested in the movie, but I have learned a quite a bit watching it myself. The movie has activities that parents can participate in with their children."
3,not the best...not the worst,"My son enjoys the video, he's only 9 months old. It's very simple, and older kids, like my 3 year old, would get bored of this video. It holds her attention for a short while though. She will watch for about 10 minutes or so. The song is cute, I really wish there were more songs. And some of the words they use are not quite correct, ""bad Spanish"" if you will. The videos she truly enjoys and pays attention to, and the ones I believe to be the best, are the Whistlefritz movies."
1,Poor Graphics,"Poor graphics are my biggest gripe about this game. You would think that with the technology today this game would have better graphics. The picture quality is really poor. Some images are neon colored so they are hard to see. Not worth $20! Honestly, I would only pay maybe $7 for it knowing what I know now. I think the company that made this should take some of the $20 they are asking and make it better quality.Anyway...my 4 year old daughter seems to like it. Although I see her getting bored with it fast. There are only a few things you can do with this game. Basically all you can do is color and put very simple puzzles together.Wait until the price goes down if you really want this toy."
3,Blues clues games,"The game is suggested for ages over 5 however my son is 4 and he got bored with it very quickly as there really is not much to it. Its cute and the graphics are good. There are 3 games on it, the stamping one bored him, the hide and seek was better but he liked painting the characters the best."
1,Ditto what everyone else said!,"Very disappointing. Graphics and color are awful and VERY hard to make out on the screen. The joystick is a joke! My 2 year old and 4 year old can't move it where they want it to go, so I always have to put the paw print where they want it and then they can click it. As another person said, there really is NO EXCUSE for such bad quality in a product these days. DO NOT BUY THIS...YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,I kept thinking that I didn't know how to work the joystick. Come to find out there was nothing to the stupid game. My daughter played it 1 time in a year! I don't even think it is worthy of a garage sale!
3,Hard to control,My 2 year old daughter loves this game. Mostly she just loves to look at the pictures on the screen and listen to the sound effects. She hasn't figured out how to play it yet.The controller is very hard to use. It sort of floats around the screen on it's own. There are no instructions.
1,The preview linked to above has nothing to do with this game,It's an ad for the company's other games aimed at older kids and adults.
4,Effective Workout,"yeah when I'm done,I can actually see the muscles look worked out,a decent sweat breaker and workout without overdoing it,15 minnutes,no excuse go for it!!"
5,This Book is Simply Amazing!!!!,"After a holiday season of revenous eating, I looked in the mirror and knew that i needed to trim down. I made a choice to get in better shape in 2004. Like most people, i needed a little help with my new lifestyle, so I looked at some fittness books online and stumbled across Quick Fit. I thought the plan was too good to be true, so I ordered the book to see if Mr. Bradley's program was for real.I have been doing the Quick Fit plan during my lunch break for only a few weeks, but already I am noticing results. Not only have I lost weight, but I feel terrific. Quick Fit energizes my day and gives me the boost I need to be productive in teh afternoon. Some other people in my office have bought the book and experienced the same results.I would reccommend Quick fit to anybody looking to trim down or simply desiring to live a more healthy, happy, and energized life."
4,Try this before you buy yourself that expensive exercise machine.,"This program is simple indeed: 10 minutes of brisk walking or simple aerobic stepping, followed by 5 minutes of strength and flexibility routines using two-5 lb. dumbells. Plus lots of good motivational advice. This is the minimum program-you can expand it by speeding up the walk, adding arm movements to the steps, more weight to the dumbells, or by adding a few more strength and flexibility routines. This author makes no presumptions about your physical abilities-if you need to start working out on a bed instead of the floor, he provides you with the basic tools and urges you to get started. I bought a perfectly good copy from one of Amazon's associated stores for a few dollars: I am doing it every day, and it really works for me."
2,waste of money,"Typical of this type of book. There is no magic or short cut to working off calories. I used it for about one week and gave up. It is truly a Quick No-Sweat Workout, that is true, but not a solution. I have learned that there is no substitute for walking and going to the gym."
4,nice,"I installed this product on my 98 RAM 1500 , although the pictures in the directions were fuzzy, it was fairly easy to install, my directions had an hvac canister in it that I had to remove bracket but my canister wasn't there or even on the vehicle, but I just mounted the one they gave me and made my own rubber grommets, they also don't tell you there is extra parts, this kit was for multiple years, I don't have enough miles on it to judge the mpg but it sounds good and the HP is noticed for sure"
5,This book rocks!!!,"It is a sad commentary that the mass market paperback of this book, had a cheesy sci-fi cover and marketed as a genre book. Gojiro is a mile a minute thrill ride looking into the soul of a post Hiroshima world. Oppenheimer vs. Godzilla for the fate of a planet. Effin' Brilliant."
4,"A campy, nuclear age, boy and his giant lizard adventure.","An extremely imaginitive work. Nuclear testing creates another Godzilla. He and his young human friend seek out the meaning of life and the connection behind their similarly troubled lives.An akward read at times, but different than anything I've ever read. A real escape from reality written in an interesting style.Read it if you can find it!"
2,Unreadable book from a great writer,"I don't know exactly what to say about this one. I really love a lot of Jacobson's articles and essays, he is a truly gifted writer. I thought the concept for this book was really cool, giving a totally new take on the famous giant lizard, but the book never got off the ground for me. I don't know, it was just impossible to get involved in the story. I actually didn't even finish this book, which is something I usually try to avoid. Oh well just a misfire though I guess some people like it."
2,I don't recommend this book,"I read the reviews... some positive and some negative, but I decided to buy it even though it had several poor reviews. It was a mistake.The book has very little theory, just a whole lot or screen shots that you need a magnifying glass to read. Looks like the author just gathered together some documentation from one of his projects or something.I'm a certified ABAP consultant with over 5 years of SAP experience, so I know my way around SAP fairly well. But I was really confused after reading this book. I didn't find it helpfull at all, and I probably won't waste my time trying to finish it.Some SAP-Press books are really good, like the HR book and the Worlflow book. But keep your money and don't buy this one."
1,Awful Book,"I thought this book was awful. Despite whatever the author(s) might indicate in the preface, I don't feel that there is any target group that would benefit from an attempt to churn through this. Most of the content is scattershooting at best and there is little in the way of foundation for those who are new to BW. All in all, I thought this book [was bad]! I was very excited to step in and really learn BW, but I will have to try and find this information elsewhere."
2,For rookies is recommended but not for technical and experience SAP people.,"This book as reference about modeling techniques is good (but not if you try to see a deeper technical stuff), but if you are finding a true guidelines for modeling with SAP BW, it not good enough. Exists a lot of good technical reference about multidimensional modeling. When I bought this book if get it supposing in it I will find more advices, recommendations and considerations about how I will represent the modeling requirements directly to analyze, identify all the tools contained in the SAP BW system, but it wasn't. It shows examples about the objects required for specific busness scenario, but never gives the advices to how to build new ones. The ""golden rules"" doesn't exist in this book. Is much better and preferable take the design & optimization course instead this book."
1,Save your money,Video quality is the poorest I've ever seen. Vhs copies of copies of copies are better. No audio during capture process. Editing is too complicated especially without a manual. The burning process doesn't work at all. Tech support can't even determine what thier own error codes mean. I broke my own first rule: NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM A COMPANY WITHOUT A PHONE NUMBER. Save your sanity and your money.
1,Poor Program,"Wow, I have used a lot of different software programs for editing, copying etc. and Honestech VHS to DVD 2.0 Deluxe is the WORST. There are so many limitations, I am not sure where to begin. First off, you have to have your tape already set up exactly where you want to begin copying. There is no option to rewind or fast forward. Not a major issue, but it does complicate things. I agree with the other reviewers comment on the quality, it is very very poor. Honestly, if you can purchase a dvd camcorder, invest the money towards that and record everything straight to dvd. In recording two separate videos, this program crashed my computer numerous times. I am running a Pentium IV, 2.8 ghz and this program killed my computer. There are so many bugs in it, I would bet that not even Honestech VHS to DVD 25.0 Deluxe would have the kinks worked out. My recommendation to all is avoid this program completely. It is not worth the money at all."
1,Doesn't work & crashes your computer too,"when i installed the software, it gives u a warning that it has it hasn't been approved by MSoft as being compatible to Windows XP. However, the instructions tell you to go ahead anyway, which I did. The result: my computer crashed and I cannot even uninstall the USB 2.0 VIDBOX software, which just wasted 1.0 MB space in my computer hard drive. This software does not work!!! Since I got it from Costco, at least I could return it and get my money back. Had I bought it from a different store, my $50+ would have been wasted. Do not buy this product. You might crash your computer too!!! I wanted to give this a zero star but the lowest choice is 1."
1,Deserves no stars - Avoid,"Bought this a few weeks ago and have been wrestling with it ever since, simply trying to convert some VHS home movies to DVD's.For days I sat at the computer, step-by-stepping through the poorly written manual. Three separate times I did everything it asked for and patiently waited 4 hours for the program to write my DVD without getting any acceptable results.I'm computer literate and expect a learning curve when I try out new stuff, but this has got to be the most poorly documented and frustrating software I've ever encountered."
1,buggy product that does not work!,"This review is for Honestech VHS to DVD 3.0 Deluxe, the newer version. I tried to install it on four computers and none of them worked. Moreover, when installing this version, a warning message pops up saying it did not pass the windows logo test!With the iron-clad proof, the store gave me a full refund. But my wasted time will never return!"
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,This is not easy for the novice. Requires quite a few things that are not included. Should be reported to the BBB for false advertising.
3,Feels like a School Textbook....,Although I'm sure that I will learn a lot from this book. It's not an attention grabber for me and its difficult to read for me due to the lack of attention span I have with this book.
3,Nice to Look At But Not Practical,"Definately eye candy. Not an instructional video, but pleasing to the eye. The guys on really are sincere yoga practicioners and the partner yoga is pleasing to watch."
1,Try Again,".... Six guys, nude great, but there was completely no interaction at all. I saw nothing sensual about watching stone figures going through yoga movements. In other couples yoga videos the people are working together, their bodies are interacting, corresponding to each other and at least they look at each other...."
1,Dont buy it.,"I bought this so I could have some eye candy while I worked out. And I guess it was interesting enough to watch the muscular men do various positions. But the yoga positions they are doing are totally impossible for the average person. I would say they are nearly impossible for the serious athlete as well. Maybe a seasoned gymnast could do them, with help. It was like watching naked cirque du soleil. Anyways. Useless to me.If you want to work out, get something more practical. The average person won't be able to do even a quarter of the positions. If you want to see nudity, them buy porn."
3,Taint-tric yoga.,"As a foolish amateur, I believed that a black costume, hood for disguise, diamond-tipped throwing stars, and a cool nickname (I chose ""A.J."") was all I needed to be a yoga master. ""Yoga Secrets--All Male Nude"" not only brought my yoga ignorance to the forefront, it taught me that being a yoga practitioner is as much a responsibility, as it is a way of life.Clearly wise beyond his years, Masaaki Hatsumi provides us with detailed insight on what it takes to be a yoga master. From ""Silent Footsteps"" to ""Hands of Rage"", Hatsumi will teach you all the techniques you need to be a successful yoga master in today's slowing economy and lukewarm job market."
3,Not my first choice,"If you are looking for a good general reference or identification guide for beetles don't buy this book. It can be a useful book and I am glad that I have it, but only as an additional reference after more up to date and practical books like American Beetles."
3,Illuminarie Silhouette Sun Stake,The Sun Stake looks nice in my flower garden however it does not illuminate at night and is in direct sunlight all day long
5,Illuminarie sun stake,"Product is great--packing of it very poor-as in none, and bottom of box open when received..but only metal was bent--they were very nice about replacing and I didn't have to return damaged one--which is still usable albeit a bit crooked...very nice people to deal with-"
3,Nice - but not so Illuminaire!,This is a nice stake - nothing special it lights up alittle but not really bright. I'd say for the price it's not worth the money. The size of the orb is about the size of a tennis ball.
2,A brilliant coming of age movie for its time.,Colegas is provocative with believable and sympathetic characters and provides insight into the lives of young boys entering manhood.
5,Great Guide Book,"This is a great guide book for Vegas. The author has personally visited all the hotels and attractions and is very honest in his reviews. His is an ""everyman"" perspective matching well with what I've found when I've visited there. He also provides updates and corrections on the website http://vegas4visitors.com , which is really helpful when this town changes on a weekly basis. I highly recommend this book for any first-time Vegas visitors and also anyone who wants to know what they missed when they were there."
3,"kinda overpriced, but it sure is handy.","like the title says, the product is a bit on the expensive side for something whose contents could be scraped together from your junk drawer and toobox for free, but in my opinion it's worth it for the simple fact that it fits in your pocket (or wetsuit).it's like a swiss army knife for the surfboard set. made well, has tools for most fin systems, and is small. that's good enough for me."
2,Was happy until...,"Got this as a gift and was very happy until I used the fin key to replace some fins on my board, it broke off....enough said. I own about 10 other $2 fin keys that have worked forever, maybe I got a lemon with this tool?"
1,Boring,"Very boring, hardly any vampire action, to much talk. I did not enjoy it all. Better to rent something else."
4,Enjoyable military series continues to deliver,"Rick Shelly has created an interesting series with his tales of the DMC. I find that his detailed descriptions of combat situations, although some go into such minute detail as eating rations every few pages, they never drag on and add to the ability of Shelly to let you feel the ""hurry up and wait"" maxin of the military. Although there were few points that seemed improbable, this is fiction after all. When I rate books it is not based on, is it the Great American Novel, but does it deliver what it promises. If you enjoy Military combat stories combined with SciFi, the DMC series delivers."
3,"A decent combat story, but little else","The first Rick Shelley book I read, ""Officer Cadet,"" caught my interest. It seemed to be similar to John Dalmas' Regiment books, but the series has so far failed to deliver. Many of the plot elements were unbelievable, yet completely predictable. Other plot elements appear to be irrelevent to the story as a whole. I don't think I would be willing to buy a fourth book in this series."
1,"Improbable and trite, are his books getting worse?","""Captain"" continues a slide in quality in Shelley's writing since the ""Buchanan Campaign"". The book starts with an inexplicable romance which leads you to question whether Nolan (the hero) should be trusted with a rifle, let alone commanding troops. An interlude involving field-testing a new logistics system leads nowhere; I had assumed it would play some part later in the book. Lastly the political situation into which the DMC is thrust seems wholly unreal. Or, if the situation doesn't, the protaganists' actions and the eventual plot developments leading from them strain disbelief. Simply awful."
2,A Dated Work,"This old translation of the poet Hafez was once popular because it fit in with the stiff yet flowery British poetry of a century ago. Now it's dated and gives little meaning to the verse. Translator Bell was more familiar with the Arabic than the Persian language, and more familiar with Iraq than Persia (Iran), the home of Hafez. Of limited value."
2,Returned my copy for credit !!!,"I too found the translation ""dry bones"" with no spirit to give life...I think it takes a poet to properly ""translate"" a poet.Literal translation just won't do. My highest praise in the exciting poetry of Hafez, will be found in the translations of Mr. Daniel Ladinsky : The Gift...or The Subject Tonight Is Love... Sorry Ms. Bell."
1,You wont get 12 !,"Reading the decription title you may think you're getting 12 batteries (Master Carton)...however listing is only for a single battery unit. Even the folks at Amazon ""assumed"" the purchase was for 12. . . Perhaps Micro-Tools should change their title to avoid future problems."
2,Misleading,Based on the description I thought I was getting a 12 pack of single batteries. That was not the case I got ONE. I needed two. I would really suggest taking off the 12-package master carton) description because there is no need for it. It was misleading.
1,"Yeah, this is 1 battery","I should have read the reviews. The item sold by amazon is a single battery. $50 for one battery, even one that is as expensive as a wein, is a touch much. Amazon was quick on the return, returning my money before I had even gotten to UPS to drop it off though.Dunno about the other sellers, but I might suggest contacting them to verify."
4,Great Whtieboard Markers!,I'm a high school teacher so I use the whiteboard quite a bit.I have used both Expo markers and the Avery markers and I have to say that the Avery makers are a lot better! They don't smell as much and I think they are longer lasting markers. I like to stock up on these markers but I just can't seem to find a store that sells these markers in bulk.
2,Soap Opera Terrorism,"Very unreal hostage story, and an insult to all the civilians who were or still are being held as hostages by the so called liberation armies: food, drinks, piano, opera and even love stories.How beautiful life can be in captivity!Besides this unrealistic touch, some interesting characters but overall boring and fails in creating any real tension regarding the fate of the hostages or compassion for their ordeal(the poor hostages have to cook their own meals...)I will continue to love opera despite this book."
4,Very Funny,"I enjoyed this book very much, but have to say, nothing tops the original Anguished English. It is still the best of the lot. My copy is old and dog-eared, but I keep it because I have so many passages marked to share with others. This one is good too, however, and does contain some zingers you don't get in the original. Get it if you're going to have both."
5,Minolta Does it again!,"Minolta has done it again. How do they do it? Microelectonics and optics are combined in one of the smallest 125 mm zoom lens 35 mm compact cameras on the market today. Its sleek lightweight aluminum body protects the obvious state-of-the-art internal electronics and optics. The photos that this camera takes are extremely accurate regarding color and light balance. The flash is more than enough. I'd recommend iso 200 film. The photos are crisp and sharp. Overall, an excellent camera. I recommend it without reservation."
3,OK for the money but broke after 6 years,"Bought this at Costco 6 years ago, within a month the panel stopped working -- no display. Called ironman support who were very responsive and helpful.They offered either fedex the replacement console or have me return it to Costco for an exchange. Since it is a heavy thing, I thought replacing the panel will be easier.Panel arrived in 2 days, and over phone ironman support person helped me replace it. Everything worked fine except for a small glitch -- Ironman has changed the model'sdimensions a little, hence my new panel did not fit perfectly -- I decided to live with it, since I could read most of the displays without difficulty.Everything was fine till one fine day after 6 years the base (on which you run, just under the belt) just broke and sagged, making it unusable almost immediately.Trying to find out if the warranty covers it. My advice: spend a few hundred more and get a better quality treadmill."
2,Buyer Beware,"Again, I must warn you that the customer service behind this treadmill is non-existent. After 2 years of light to moderate use, our motor burned out and I've tried to use the ""10 year warranty"" on the motor to no avail. Ironman does not respond to any attempts to contact them.Who cares if the treadmill works great for a short time but then breaks down and you can't get a company to stand behind their product. This is too much money to spend on a treadmill that is guaranteed to break down and then you can't get repaired.DON'T BUY FROM IRONMAN!!!"
2,Nice Machine but HORRIBLE Customer Service,"We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer."
3,Excellent but bad motor,"We both used this machine. Absolutely loved all the features for the price; sturdy, easy to program, the fan was a nice touch. Unfortunately after two months of usage the motor blew-stopped while in use. Was thrown off the back."
4,review,This was replacement for original that was damaged when we received it. Replacement was handled very well and in timely manner.Thanks
4,The Women are the Stars,"I got this movie as a rental from Netflix and really enjoyed it. I don't know why this guy is front and center of the poster. The stars of the movie are really the women behind him and their relationship with each other. It was refreshing to see women who seemed able to handle themselves. No one fell and twisted their ankle, no stupid damsel in distress. This movie seemed to try to send the message that these women were in control of their sexuality. I would have given it a higher rating but I don't agree that empowerment includes turning tricks. Also be warned that this movie contains scenes of domestic violence."
1,wasn't impressed,"All these long term returns people give in regards to stocks, bonds, gold and such do not involve active management but instead take a buy and hold strategy. So why follow a theory of regression to the mean the author suggest on page 36 in asset allocation. Why increase your expenses every year by selling some of your top performing sectors and use that money to buy into the poor performing sectors. This strategy seems like market timing set on automatic and we all know that it's very hard to time the market consistently. Index funds that beat most funds don't market time. They work by being fully invested in the asset class, they have a long term buy and hold view, and they keep expenses and taxes low. You can get basic asset allocation info for free from Vanguard's website which also offers target date retirement funds for those who want to use asset allocation the simple way."
5,Very helpful in planning my own portfolio,This booked helped me greatly in planning my retirement portfolio. It has great examples and plenty of research to make the case for each asset class (and sub-class). I look forward to the second edition.
4,This book,"I would consider it a good book for someone who is fairly knowlegable about investments already. If you are a beginner, I think you will find this book a bit confusing. Best of luck."
5,Great monitor!,I use this monitor at work every day. It is great. Very bright and works with analog or digital signals. You won't be dissappointed with this or any other Samsung monitor.
3,"Too Bright and some menu controls are ""Not Available""","I just got the monitor yesterday. After plugging into my computer, I found the monitor was too bright. Unfortunately, my graphics card has no option to adjust the brightness, so I had to adjust the brightness to 0 on the monitor. Some menu controls, color for example, were ""Not Available."" It came with a base which cannot swirl. I could not see 3D-feel on small icons as they used to be on my 20"" CRT monitor, but large pictures were great."
5,Tons of fun!,"For those who aren't sure how to do these mystery puzzles: You read the enclosed book. Then you put together the puzzle or puzzles blind (no picture art-see my review for ""B Is For Birthday"" Mystery Jigsaw Puzzle by TDC). The answer to the mystery is enclosed in the puzzle or puzzles. However if you are not exactly the patient or determined type of personality I wouldn't be the first to recommend these as they have no picture- part of the mystery and challenge.This puzzle was the first puzzle I put together in a long time. I was pleased to say it took me 3 weeks to put it together. Most of the pieces were similarly colored which added to the challenge. I absolutely LOVED it!I also purchased with ""A Is For Arson"", the following puzzles:""B Is For Birthday""""C Is For Chocolate""""D Is For Diamonds""I highly recommend these for those who love a good challenge and love to have brain stimulation."
2,Love the smell...just not ALL the time,This is one of my favorite fragrances - but my bottle leaks and has leaked since the beginning...so the smell is too strong and I can't travel with it at all. Bummer.
4,great welder,A great welder for the price. The first job welded fenders on a boat trailer with no problems and made twenty dollars.
2,Not the best...,"I would have to say that I don't particularly agree with this book. I mean, in my opinion, the most important thing about an apple is that it is food, not that it is round. Regardless, it did provide for an interesting conversation in my 2nd grade class, as well as a fun get-to-know-you activity. After reading the book, disucssing differing view points, each student created a page about ""The most important thing about me is_____""."
1,Discard it!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Its title deceives us. We expect to see things like ""kittens are cuddly,"" or ""mothers love us."" Instead we read ""snow is white,"" and ""rain is wet."" We are led to believe there is something important in ""whiteness"" and ""wetness,"" but these are merely descriptions of the world about us. In giving such bland descriptions, the author attempts to derive values from facts, in effect deadening our senses to what should be depicted for children as a wonderful world. The fact of the matter is, there's nothing important about this book at all. Discard it!"
4,Short and Unique,"Margaret Wise Brown has some good books out there. My favorite is the Fur Family book, but this is also a good one. Her books are a bit random/different/steeped in a different style than most. The Important Book had some fun concepts (other reviewers have explained the pattern of the writing).I found the ending a bit... trite (the important thing about you is that you are you), but I'm not a kid and I think children just enjoy it.I also found the illustrations weren't what I was expecting - the full color cover left me thinking there would be all full color illustrations. About every other page spread is black and white. Sometimes it contributes to the book, sometimes it doesn't. It isn't bad, it just was not what I expected.I sound critical - I don't mean to be. I give the book 4 stars because it is good. I just want to share some details that might be interesting."
5,The Important Book,Great to use as a teaching tool. Students can use the model from this book to find important things about all kinds of academic subjects. It helps with main ideas for my second graders.
5,affirming perceptions,"This thoughtfull Brown book methodically affirms a small child's growing ability to construct opinions about his or her world. Misunderstood as asserting objective classifications, Brown instead elaborates on the ellusive season of child development when subjective and objective information are indistinguishable:""the important thing about a daisy is that it is white"" and air is ""the color of air"".Recommended if you want the child in your life to catch Brown's vision of personal discovery."
5,Great book,I used this book at the beginning of the school year to get my special ed students to write about what was important to them or about why the things in the book are important. They all loved the activity and it was one of their favorite picks for reading time.
5,AWESOME,"This is a cute book. I read it to my first graders but they really didnt get it. Yet, I read it again and they totally got it! Personally, I love this book.... Every child should read and/or have this book read to him/her."
4,Immediately applicable tools for dealing with change,"In part because author Daryl R. Conner applies common sense ideas, and in part because his ideas have spread throughout corporate culture, some aspects of this book may seem familiar. Conner would probably count that as a positive development, because one of his core premises is that change is exhausting and, therefore, you should try to make changes as palatable as possible to the people they will affect. Thomas Edison did this by making the first electric lights resemble the already-familiar gas fixtures. But even if you've heard all of this before, don't underestimate the book's usefulness. Conner's theories may not surprise you, but he offers many immediately applicable tools for dealing with change, and he uses clear, expressive language to do so. Because you'll learn several useful tips if you read even a few pages, we recommend this book to anyone guiding any kind of organization - family, nonprofit, business or school - through change."
5,Recommended by an industry expert,Change agents everywhere get the book which was reecommended by an industry expert. It's a staple for any active change agent.
4,A solid read for Change and the Management of Change,"Even though this book is was written nearly 20 years ago with some more recent updates, the learning lessons are timeless. The art of managing change and more to the point how to improve during change can be learned by reading and observing. It is a process of how you react given a variety of events that can drive change. History can teach you as much as current events so any opportunity you have to read a well-documented book on the subject you should seize the moment. Remember that a well-documented failure can be as insightful and as instructive as a success story. Sometimes it is even a better tool for learning as you get to see how bad things can be if you don't get it right. As in any profession it is important to stay current and read widely. This book is a good place to start."
2,One important feature is missing...,"I recently purchased Make it or Break it Volume 2 and automatically assume it should provide closed caption or subtiles but to my surprise, this volume 2 dvd doesnt but the first volume does. So why stop there? And plus I know that on tv, it provided closed captions. I am deaf myself and this bit of information would have been helpful."
2,Why no English subtitles???,"This is a fantastic series, I was anxiously awating part 2 of season 1. But WHAT HAPPENED??? There are NO English subtitles for the hearing impaired. I'm not totally deaf, but most of the characters in this series talk very fast, and their enunciation is not that great. Part 1 included subs in French, Spanish, and English for hearing impaired. In part 2 they dropped this essential feature. WHY??? A subtitle track is a simple text file with timing script. Less than 1 MB of space. The show had closed captions available on the broadcast TV but NOT on the DVD collectors edition??? I am so sick of this!!! I will be re-selling this set, and waiting for a re-issue with proper features.Please write to ABC Family Channel, Paul Lee, President, 3800 West Alameda Ave., Burbank, CA 91505 and let them know your concerns, Thank you!(La Femme Nikita did the same thing. Seasons 1-4 all have English subs. But not on Season 5. Show a little concern for the hearing impaired.)"
1,Saved by Reviews,"I was just about to purchase this dvd and I noticed the poor review average so I read the reviews and found out there were no English subtitles so I did not buy. They are not mandatory for me but very helpful and seeing as this show is not a ""positively must watch"" I decided to pass. Volume one (which had subtitles) was by ABC studios-this one is buy Gaiam (which I never heard of). Cheapening the product is absolutely no way to attract customers. Shame to all involved in this decision."
5,Great Show!,"I have the first half of the season and I have for years and have wanted to get the rest! But I never had the money. I finally bought it! This is a great show! I have seen the entire show and I love it, I can't wait to buy the rest of the series."
3,Kids,My girls enjoyed the season and I have to admit I found myself watching it as well. They liked the gymnastics and the teenage drama that went with it
5,Great,My daughter and her friends love it!!! Being a gymnast and knowing the life of these girls are so similar to what actually goes on during our practices and competitions!!
4,love it. love everything about it.,"I would highly recommend this for people of all ages. It is really easy to see the disc, and allows you to play at any time of the day or night. I would recommend getting some of those LED glowsticks with the lanyards on them. If the players all wear those you can actually see who you are throwing to. This was an improvement over our use of tiki torches, which had disastrous results."
5,Bought Three,I have three grandkids so I bought three for Christmas presents to use in Florida on the beach. They loved them!
4,Great Product,Had this about a month now. We've been throwing it in the street so its taken some abuse from landing on concrete. No problems so far but the other night the lights seemed dimmer and it would turn itself off on occasion when caught. I suspect the batteries are dying.
5,simply the best music dvd available,"Okay first i am a maiden fan.I've seen the band like 7 times including the brave new world tour. This is the same exact show ive seen except Bruce Dickinson stage entrance in sign of the cross. On the dvd bruce is not crucified like on the others gigs of the tour.A lot of new songs, a good thing i'm a little tired of their live set, always the same songs played live. The picture is crystal clear, except for some dark scene... The sound is incredibly loud. The vocal is not mix in the front speaker only on the left and right and the result is very good , a real live ambiance with a lot of crowd shouting...Buy it this is the best maiden live video. Yes its better than life after death. Sorry for the nostalgic...."
4,Hawaiian Quilting Made Easy By Milly Singletary,Hawaiian Quilting Made EasyThere are many good illustrations and several graphed patterns are included. Good all over information and instructions although a couple of instructions are somewhat confusing and could have been explained differently. Otherwise an excellent buy.
3,Hawaiian Quilting..not easy!,"Hawaiian quilting is not easy! This book does however introduce you to the art of hawaiian quilt making. I am a beginner and this was quite confusing. However, after trying some of the techniques offered in this book, I feel I am qualified to teach someone else!"
3,Doesn't Keep Interest,"I bought this for my daughter when she was a toddler. She liked it until about number 11 then would lose interest, even after several times watching. She loved the bloopers and would want me to play that section over and over. Good for entertaining a child for a brief period but I am not sure she really learned counting from watching this."
2,Should make it 1-10 instead as disc gets boring after repetitive counting,"I am not sure how should I rate this item. I was searching for a disc that teaches numbers and counting. This does the job very well. It's simple, straight forward, but super boring. Almost put me to sleep when I was watching it with my 19 month old toddler. You hear ONE, and see the number ""1"", and one object appear. This is repeated with different object 3-4 times. Then it goes to TWO. And you hear the count...One, Two....again with a different object, 3-4 times. By the time you get to 20, you have already heard ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE.......a hundred time.There is no pause in between to ""wake up"" the sleepyhead with songs at all. I have to say it's boring. I wish the maker put some songs to entertain the viewer."
2,BO-RING!,I bought this for my 18 month-old daughter because she loves the Brainy Baby ABC video. But this video is EXTREMELY repetitive! It bored her so much that she lost interest by the time they reached number 7 on the first viewing. She hasn't asked for it since. Very disappointed.
2,bore my baby video,"I know that repitition is good for a learning child, but this video carries it to an extreme. Almost the entire video is counting objects. There was no real entertainment for me or my 3 kids. My four year old and 3 year old could not sit still for more than 60 seconds to watch this. My 8 month old seemed even more disinterested then the rest of us, and she is the one I bought it for. The most exciting part of the video was the song they sing in the middle of the video about counting your fingers and toes. I bought this video after watching the Brainy Video Left Brain tape. That tape was very entertaining. So I was very disappointed that this tape was so dull and boring."
1,What a disappointment.,"I bought this CD on the strength of James' song ""Cold Missouri Waters"", as perfomed by Cry, Cry, Cry. Apparently, CMW was a fluke, because the songs on this album are all quite boring. James has a wonderful way with words, but he should find someone else to set them to music. His melodies are too simple and repetitive, and the song structures are mostly the same: verse followed by verse followed by verse. There is not one song on the entire CD (including ""Captain Torres"") that I ever want to hear again."
5,Great toy,"The toy is great, not educational at all, but fun and so different then other toys, You put the objects that come in the box on Harry's hand and push his other hand in and the objects float (Ball), a feather that spins and a box that opens and a ghost fills with air and waves back and forth. I would recommend this toy."
4,Not as advertised!,"I was a little bit disappointed because when the toy came it was not the set they showed on the site. The one I received has the old logo, not the new one shown in the photo. And it was not by ""Daron"" and it didn't include some of the stuff it showed, such as luggage and the baggage vehicle. Overall, a fun set but not what I was expecting."
5,great price,these are the easiest pools to set up and hold up very well.I have used them over the years.it is important that the ground is pretty level.I use sand under mine to help level it..
1,fox above ground pool is a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do not buy from them,Amazon not at fault but my due diligent to warn customers about intex and fox adobe ground pools. This is the first item that pops up when you search intex and watch out if you like having no product support and getting screwed please buy from intex or fox adove ground pools. You are lucky to get a person on the phone for hours and then you are on your own. Thanks for taking my money. Thought I was buying a pool and well call me old fashion but someone to stand behind it. If that is the case be prepared to drown!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Returned this pool...,Had a hole in it as soon as we set it up. The filter also leaked unless I set it on top of a cooler a couple feet off the ground. We returned it and bought a metal frame pool with skimemr filter.
3,price is high,I didn't do much research on the price before ordering this from Amazon. I just found out the same pool is sold in ebay for only $75 plus a free pump which costs $31.
1,Large above ground pool.,"We had purchased one of these locally last year. I couldn't find the same product, so I ordered it on Amazon. We found that after we had set it up, the air would not stay in the inflatable upper ring. This causes the pool to sag. In order to send it back, we had to empty30x10x3 ft of water and dry it out and roll it clean and send it back. I don't recommend this."
2,Pool isn't made well anymore,"We bought one of these years ago. It lasted well. We needed to replace it and bought another. It's no comparison. The pump is smaller; not big enough for the pool. I had to buy another larger pump. The side is so weak that when we filled the pool, it stretched the hose holes so far out of shape it won't seal. I would recommend a different one if there are any options. Not worth this price."
2,headache,"i recieved my pool with its box totally trashed...the handle that fits into the skimmer was bent and could not fit the accessories that comes with it. after filling up the pool, i found out that the pump was not working. i called customer service and told me that i had to send my receipt and fill up an application that they sent me, and fax it back to them. i did that and it will take about 48 hours before they actually get the fax to the right agent. after that it takes about 5-7 business days to send you a new one. i am still waiting and hoping that my water will not turn green. i added chlorine tablets and hopefully this will keep it clean until my new pump arrive."
3,Let's see if the second one works,The first one I got arrived with a leak in the air ring at the top and we now have wasted a thousand gallons of water. It deflated the first evening when we set it up and we looked out to see water rushing over our driveway.Waiting for the replacement to arrive and hoping that this one is ok...It was a fifth bday present for my son. These things happen so waiting and hoping that I love the replacement.
5,THE BEST $250 WE'VE EVER SPENT FOR ENTERTAINMENT,"Bought this pool in early spring 2010, upgraded pump to Intex 2500gph filter, saltwater system, and skimmer kit. Pool has been virtually maintenance free. Left up all winter, simply ran filter continously when temps fell below freezing. Also run filter continously when weather turns hot and salt water system 6 hrs daily. The water is always crystal clear and the local pool place says the water tests fine and needs nothing. I believe the key is set it up and leave it up, but even if I bought one each year, this thing is a super value for the entertainment it offers."
4,"good pool, holding up well so far.",love that it comes with stoppers so you can take off the filter and hoses without draining the pool!! So perfect for winter when there is no place to store the pool!
4,Keeping the kids cool and happy,"We have had a larger version of this pool in the past, and it has been a total pain to set up. This one, being smaller, went up very quickly and rather effortlessly. I already knew that a perfectly level spot was necessary, but with a smaller pool I think it's much more forgiving that with a larger.The kids have used it for a few weeks and it is keeping then cool and happy. For me, the top ring has been quite a pain. It is losing air, so I am constantly filling. The older one that we had did not have this issue, so I think this one came with a bit of a leak. Better in the top ring than in the pool itself, I'd say.Overall, I still think this is a good value for the money spent. We have had many happy hours floating around."
3,"Nice pool for the money, but some limitations","This is a nice pool for the money, bit there are definite issues:First, as been pointed out by others, make sure to set it up on a completely level surface. No if, ands, or buts.Second, the top inflatable ring is extremely prone to leaks. For each of the last two years, after I have taken mine out of winter storage, there have been multiple leaks in the ring. Since a properly inflated ring is crucial for this pool, this is a big deal.Third, the pump on the new model has a box on the electrical cord with ""Test"" and ""Reset"" buttons. This sounds great, but I like to keep my pump on a timer so that it runs at a certain time every day. I can no longer do this, since every time the timer kicks in, you still have to go press the ""Reset"" button on the box to turn the pump on. This defeats the purpose of automating the process with a timer."
3,Good Kiddy Pool,I got the pool so I could teach my 4 and 6 year old grand daughters how to swim. It is great because they can stand on the bottom too. I only gave the pool three stars because I just can't seem to stop the leaks around the outflow and inflow connectors on the pool and filter. Not a very good design on the screw on connectors.
3,Its Okay for kids,"My daughter is three years old. She walks around in the pool without a floatie, just with her parent on guard.The pool is wonderful for her and nice to float in."
5,Love the Pool,"We love the pool. Very easy to set up, maintain. We have gotten so much joy having it. The grandchildren love it, we love it, the neighbors love. If you want more friends, just buy the pool :)"
3,COLLAPSING POOL,"great product for the cost, my biggest problem with it is that it requires a flat ground, folks i mean a flat ground or else you get the pool collapsing. i tried flattening the ground 5 times now and i still didnt get it, i even brought in a professional landscaper to get it right but still wasnt good enough; i was off by may 1/4 an inch on one side. so i eventually figured i can use it only if i fill it to 2.5 inches (instead of the 3 inches), which is fine for my 3 and 5 yr old. bottom line DONT BUY IT IF YOU DONT HAVE A FLAT GROUND, AND I MEAN FLAT."
2,Great while it lasted (one summer),"We initially really liked this pool, but the inflatable tube that forms a ring around the top leaks air at the seam and was also easily punctured by my kids splashing & playing. It is almost impossible to keep water in the pool with that ring deflated and the pool is unusable now. There is also a small hole at the bottom that leaks water, but becomes plugged when the pool is full. Just remember that your purchase may only last for 1 season."
4,GREAT POOL,I got this in preperation for next year. It's a replacment for a 16x42 that lasted 3 years. Hopefully this one lasts just as long.
1,Not a Happy Swimmer,"We just got our pool all set up and filled up with a little over 5,000 gallons of water in it, put the salt in it (we bought the salt water filter too) and there was a hole in the seam! We called intex and basically got a run around about their ""great product"". I am not happy with them at all. After we cut this and that out of the pool and send back to them they will send me another pool. I'm out the money for the 135 lbs. of salt and the 5,000+ gallons of water. Oh but if I want I can spend all that money again and hope for a better put together pool!"
4,Well love once we get it up and going.,"We received this pool and set it upo, but our level area was just one inch off and the pool kept calapsing. So, we had to start over and relevel the area. Once we got it up and started filling it again. We hooked the pump up and discovered one of the hoses has a hole in it. I'm trying to find a replacement hose, now. Maybe once the pool is up and going, we'll finally get to enjoy it. Hopefully before September.Intex Easy Set 12-Foot by 30-Inch Round Pool Set"
2,Intex customer service is POOR!,I bought this pool brand new to replace the Summer Escapes brand Pool from last year. In hopes that this pool would be better made. Kids all excited to get it set up. We get home and the box is missing parts. The pool company has a paper right in the box that says DO NOT return to store to call them so we do. Well long story short is has been almost two weeks and we still do not have the part we need to use our brand new pool. We call and get hung up on or told someone will call us back or email us. We still have not herd back from anyone at this company and are waiting for our part. Must say I will not be giving them anymore of my money when this is how the treat people. This is not my mistake but the company's and we are stuck with a new pool we can not even use :-(
3,Half Pleased,"We had a couple of obstacles before being successful. First of all, the pool came in an open box, not so well protected packaging. As we are pumping the pool, there were 2 holes we had to patch in order for it to fill up. But once we filled it up it was all fun from there on. We had a pool party for kids birthday and everyone had a blast. Pool was big enough for 8 children average size to get in and have enough room to swim and play in."
5,Cool Pool,"For the money this pool rocks! Ladder is a little unsteady, but nothing you can't live with. The pool is not made for adult swimming, but is a refreshing lounge pool after a hot day of working in the yard. Easy set up but definitely use two people so that you do not have ripples in the bottom of the pool."
3,right away,"You need to start with chemicals right away. There is nothing about this in the instructions. Ours turned green, with little white flecks throughout it. Nothing to do except drain it and start over. Even though we shocked it, there was still stuff on the bottom of the pool, which got stirred around once someone is in there again. Also, even though our lawn looked perfectly flat, we found out there is about a 1 foot difference from one side to the other. Luckily we put the filter on the 'deep' end. Otherwise, the water wouldn't have been deep enough to cover the outlets.We will take ours down for the winter. When we put it back up next year, we will make a platform that is level and start out with the chemicals that are necessary."
3,Complete Book of Numbers,"Pither's book introduces concepts and practices that I have encountered in no other book on numerology. He has obviously done his research and his book is a potential gold mine for those wanting to stretch their numerological skills.However, overlooking the appendix, it would make a superb 100 page book. Pither tends to belabor points and repeat himself until ideas that could be stated in a single page become whole chapters! Subjected to some extensive editing this could turn into a compelling work.At other times the author tends to go into great detail about a process and then seems to skip over the nuts-and-bolts of how it can be employed, as if convincing you of its validity is all that is necessary.The Complete Book of Numbers holds a wealth of information if you are willing to dig through the haystack until you encounter the needle! Not an easy read but worth it for those who are tenacious."
3,can buy cheaper at target,"I heard about this product on a breast feeding fbook page I'm a part of. Amazon had it so I bought it. It works ok for me, nothing spectacular, but I think I have a little more breast milk than when I don't drink it. I probably would've given it 4/5 stars however the shipping cost made this product over $11. I recently found it at target and paid like $3.99. That's where I'll be getting it from now on."
2,Didn't work for me,"This product did not work for me. However, I am not certain that I was using it as intended so this may be why (but I doubt it). I started using it when my baby was about 7 weeks old to try and increase the amount of milk I was producing in a day. I was only getting about 15oz so I was trying to see if this would help my production. I am unclear as to whether this tea is intended to help the milk come in the days after delivering exclusively, or whether it is also supposed to help increase supply in the weeks after. Either way I know a couple of people who said it worked for them but it did not work for me."
3,It worked... kind of,"I bought this after my daughter went through a nursing strike at two months to help build my milk supply back up so we could continue to breastfeed. I noticed a little bit of an increase in my supply but it wasn't quite enough and, ultimately, nursing still didn't work out for us past three months."
3,mothers tea,i didn't notice a big change in milk production. the taste wasn't all that bad if you added alot of honey and sugar
2,Tastes Terrible / May cause Colicky babies!,"After two months of having to pump about 8oz even after feeding my baby, all of a sudden, my milk supply plummeted. I was told about this tea, and thought I would give it a try.IT TASTES HORRIBLE!!!! Even with cream and sugar, it's disgusting! I drank it anyway (the things we do for our babies). A few things: It made my sweat smell like maple syrup. It made my milk taste different, and my son wasnt happy. After two days of using this tea, my son was colicky for an entire week! This is a normally very happy smiley, rarely crying baby. He cried constantly, and it was nearly impossible to console him. I stopped taking the tea, and after a week, he was back to normal.I'm sure this works different for different women, and babies, as we are all different - but just a fair warning! I know this has happened to other women also.I will say - my milk supply did come back for the three days I was using the tea!"
3,It helped,This product did help with my milk supply but not really my cup of tea. lol I didn't really like the flavor much at all.
5,Great product!,"The best product to help with healthy milk follow! I had a regular flow, but when I would regular drink this I would be able to produce much more."
5,Thank God for this tea!,"I don't even know where to begin to express my relief in finding this tea! I've been determined to exclusively breastfeed my daughter since she was born and was doing so with no problem until I got mastitis. 2 weeks of antibiotics and pumping & dumping took a toll on my supply, especially when my daughter got used to the bottle. At three months my supply went down to about 14oz total all day. I had to start supplementing which I hated and was almost in tears for a week as I watched my supply get lower and lower. i was told about this tea by a nutritionist and it's been a Godsend! My milk is up to almost twice as much from just having one or two cups a day. I'll admit that i'm not crazy about the flavor. Tastes like black licorice which I hate, but it's definitely drinkable. I just drink it cold with lemon and sugar and hold my breath. I'm a believer now and would recommend it to anyone!"
3,yet to see results.,"I don't think I've been drinking the tea long enough to see results. The reason for the 3 stars is the taste. The teas anise seed scent is very strong. I read in another review that it had a black licorice essence, but i didn't expect it to bug me so much. The flavor isn't as strong, but when you're nose deep in a mug of anise steam its hard to ignore it in the taste as well. Just saying, I'm glad I didn't go for the value pack."
3,Not sure,"The first few daysI noticed a difference,after that I am not sure, I can't say I see much of an increase in my supply, of course my child is two years old and nursing is more of a comfort thing for him. But I keep drinking the tea, I just like it.Lisa"
2,not impressed,"The amount of fenugreek recommended to promote milk production by far exceeds the amount in this tea. The tea has to seep for 10 minutes before drinking. The box suggests drinking 5 cups of tea a day as well- who has that kind of time? . There are 16 tea bags in a box so it will only last 2 and a half days, which makes it overpriced and insufficient for the needs of a mom trying to build up her milk supply. Fenugreek capsules work- this doesn't."
4,Lactation Tea,It really doesn't taste too bad at all and I do see a bit of difference but not as much as I hoped.
2,Not my cup of tea.,"I didn't really care too much for the taste of this tea. I tried it twice, just to give it a chance, but I still didn't like it."
3,Works Well but the taste....,I was recommended this product by a friend. It definitely increased my milk supply after a couple of days (3 cups a day). I wish I had known about this product when I had my first two children as I have had difficulty maintaining a supply of milk. The only reason that I'm giving Mother's Milk Tea 3 stars is because I am not a fan of the taste. It is definitely bitter. I have been sweetening it with some sugar currently but intend to try honey as recommended on the box.
4,What a good find!,"Just wanted to say that I found this tea when my milk supply had started to decrease (about 4m post baby) I didnt want to stop nursing but my little one was getting VERY frustrated with the amount that was available. I found this tea at Stop n Shop in the health food section and gave it a try. After a week I noticed that my baby girl wasnt so frustrated and I was able to get back on schedule of pumping a little extra each day. Directions say to drink one cup of prepared tea 3-5 times daily. I drank it about 2-3 times daily but found the tea chilled was much better!It has a bitter taste, but is definatly drinkable.Definatly worth a try!!"
3,I think it works,I only gave it three stars because I really don't know if it helps or if it is just my immagination. I have tried this and Fenugreek capsules to help improve my milk supply ( I am NOT a big producer). The Fenugreek just made me smell like maple syrup and I don't think it increased my supply at all. The tea is pleasant tasting with a little sugar added. I actually look forward to drinking it now. I drink four cups a day and have a decent supply. It does make me urinate frequently after I have had a cup but it's not bothersome.
2,Meh,It tastes like black licorice to me...and it didn't help with my breast milk supply. Maybe it would for someone who would be willing to drink it all day everyday. I drank it twice a day.
4,"Tastes good, not sure how much it helped with milk production","I like the way this tea tastes, its a little sweet by itself so I didn't really have to add any sugar. I'm not sure how much it increased my milk production but it did make sure that I drank plenty of fluids during the day!"
5,5 stars,"Tea tastes faintly like black licorice, but if you don't mind that-its very mild. Drank it for lactation assistance; still unclear of its impact but worth a try. Purchased on Amazon and received within days of order."
4,Milk supply,"This tea helped me increase my milk supply when I was running just a little low. I was up to 5 cups for a while, and needed to switch to fenugreek drops, but the tea definitely boosted my supply, especially before I went back to work. One suggestion: don't drink Mother's Milk Tea before bed if your child sleeps well at night--you will wake up engorged the next morning!"
1,Never worked for me,"I tried this tea with both my boys. I breastfed both for 10 months. You are supposed to drink about 3-5 glasses a day, I believe, and this was just not realistic for me. The taste is good I have to say.I used FENUGREEK from the vitamin shoppe (you have to take 6-9 pills each day to really get results). The Fenugreek worked awesome within about 48 hours but you have to take 3 pills 3 times a day. Blessed Thistle goes will with Fenugreek too but I felt like I smelled like a vegetable. WEIRD???"
3,Testing it now an hope it works,"I can't rate this product just yet because I am currently drinking Mother's Milk Tea and I hope it works for me. I tried the Fenugreek and Blessed Thistle and those products didn't do anything for me. I can tell you that it's nasty to my taste. I don't like drinking it whether it's sweetened with honey or not. It's nasty. Maybe this will work since I don't like drinking it. I'll try it until the box is gone, 3x a day. Ahhhhh, the misery, but I'll get through it."
4,Taste good!,"Not sure if this tea is working, but I'll keep trying because I love the taste! I drink it a couple of times a day with honey."
4,Not as bad as i expected!,"I have to say, I did not have high expectations for this tea. First off, I despise fennel, anise and anything that taste like them. However, this tea does not have an offensive licorice taste. I recommend sweetening with honey or sugar. I would also recommend making iced tea with it. Overall, i'm pleased with the results and the taste."
2,Cole2,"Unfortunately, this product did not work me. I drank three cups a day with no increase in my milk supply. I has more success with the fenugreek supplement."
3,Just Not Enough For Me,"Bought this b/c I have a history of supply issues & unfortunately it didn't help out. In all fairness I am one of the few that it takes a lot of intervention to increase my supply, so maybe for someone with mild issues or someone just wanting some help maintaining a good supply this product would be fine. I will warn that it has a STRONG black licorice taste b/c of the herbs used-I actually like the taste but I can see how this wouldn't be for everyone."
5,Organic Mother's Milk tea,I believe it works... it helped boost my milk supply a bit. I only drink it once every night before bed since it's around the time my baby is mostly hungry. So I can say it helps somewhat.
3,A wonderful Christmas !,"this is not for serious people cause it got alot of cheezy scenes in there but is an okay movie to watch with your family and have a crazy laugh over the crazy actors you see in the movie the best part of this movie is at the end where Mr Feliciano sang ''Feliz Navidad '' and it makes a nice end on this movie , Mr Jimenez is not as nasty as I thought he was going to be. I gave 2 stars on this movie not 3 cause still need it a little bit more of Kick on the movie and not 4 or 5 because is not the best movie out there but it is entertaining , crazy stupid , silly and cheezy.If u are a serious person I will not recomended it to you at all dont waste your time on this movie cause you wont like it but if you have a nice sense of humor and if you like cheezy stuff to watch once a while rent it buy it and watch it !"
1,"Slow, boring movie","The plot was slow; the theatrical and technical quality low. For the first time in years, I actually stopped the movie and decided not to view the rest, even after trying to be patient trudging through it for 45 minutes. Unfortunately, it is a movie I regret having paid for."

3,"Decent book, but a bit confusing","""Dancing in the Dark"" by Maureen Lee, is a book with two stories happening at the same time. The book opens up with Millie Cameron being asked to clean out the apartment of a great aunt Flo who has recently died. Millie may seem at young woman with a good life, but in fact Millie and sister and brother are hiding years of abuse. As Millie clean out Flo's apartment she learns of Flo's many secrets and how they impact Millie and her family.I have to admit that enjoyed Flo's story more than Millie's. I didn't really think much of Millie. And at time I was confused with all of the characters and why they were needed for the story. It was a decent read, but not a book that I will hang on too."
2,Decadence Can Be Boring,"Marguerite Eymery (aka Rachilde) was a twenty-year-old girl when she wrote MONSIEUR VENUS. Although she apparently has the writing skills to write a good book, she was fixated on issues of gender reversal of interest primarily to people who go in for that sort of thing. I, for one, do not. Having a young woman attempt to play the male role in her relationship with an effeminate young man (the ""Monsieur Venus"" of the title, known in the book as Jacques Silvert) for 150 pages was rather excruciating to this reader. Without passing judgment on anyone else's sexual preferences, I found that this book consisted primarily of uninteresting characters involved in uninteresting activities."
1,A Bootleg obviously,Hilarious! Sgt. Pepper on the cover and it contains Paul McCartney's solo stuff too.Why does Amazon allow these kind of messes to be sold on here? I got a good laugh out of seeing this anyway.
5,I love these slipcovers,These slipcovers were wonderful for my daughters boppy. I hated having to wash her boppy every few days and now with the slipcovers I can just throw one in the wash with the rest of my laundry and slip the extra one on the boppy and she is ready to use it. I love the designs available too.
2,poor quality,"The velvet cover was not able to zip around the pillow. I think it was a faulty zipper. I need to return it...grrr... just what a new mother wants to do in her non-existent free time! Also, this pillow seems better suited to older babies since my newborn tended to fall into the 'valley' between my belly and the curve of the pillow. Hmmm, 'My Best Friend' nursing pillow might have been better?"
1,unreadable racist paranoid tripe,There is nothing good in this book. In fact it shouldn't be described as a book its just an inept collection of words.
5,One of the best video game soundtracks out there.,This may be one of the best video game soundtracks out there. It even has the mall music from the game. Only thing I didn't get was that Gone Guru wasn't on this soundtrack. Every other song is but that one. Ah well. Good soundtrack anyway.
2,Not as expected,"There were a few good songs, like Justified and Slave, but most of the rest were short, boring tracks. And for some reason it doesn't feature Gone Guru, the track from the escaped convicts fight. For its cost, not a good buy at all."
1,not worth the price,I was expecting at least 1-4 large tootsie rolls but i only received the mini cheap ones i can buy at a 99 cent store. Not practical at all. The lunch box was about 3/4 full. I definitely would not recommend to buy this lunchbox. I give it a star because the lunch box itself is nice; the inside was probably worth a dollar.
5,Delta Jet,"I purchased this as a gift for our 3 year old grandson to be included in a special Disney World Trip gift at Christmas. This was to discuss his first airplane ride. I thought he would play with it a little, but he loved it. I explained what each of the trucks did to service the aircraft so he would understand the trip. The other presents were second to this. He loved it."
5,Great toy. Excellent service.,"Cute toy. My boys love to build airports with their blocks and these plane sets do the trick for making it ""real."" The toys are sturdy, but not indestructible. If stepped on or left out for the puppy they can lose a tail fin. However, they do stand up to normal play. I would recommend them to any kids who like to play ""travel"" or to build airports out of blocks or Lincoln Logs."
2,die-cast airport playset,bought this for my son. He does not enjoy it. The set is much smaller than the picture.does not worth it.
1,Very strong American accent - not made by French natives!!,"I am a French native and bought this dvd for my daughter. I speak French to her all the time and thought that hearing French from the tv would just help reinforce her learning.I was extremely disappointed by this dvd. The French American accent is so strong I can barely understand what it says!?! Also, there are LOTS AND LOTS of mistakes and spelling errors whenever some text shows up on the screen.Furthermore, I do not find the dvd appealing for young kids. My daughter is bored to death after 5 minutes and wants me to switch to the Baby Einstein dvds, so much better, but unfortunately not in French! I wish I could have previewed that dvd before buying it, because I certainly would have never purchased it! If you do speak French as a native or learned it in school, you will be disappointed."
4,pretty good,"My son is 14 months, and is learning english, french and chinese at the same time. He already sits through the entire video as he is engrossed by it. It really helps that the images are REAL and not animation or puppets that babies don't relate to! For a beginner french for babies, it is fine, although, yes, there are a few mistakes, (i am from Quebec), but not enough to make any real difference for babies to learn french. I like that the ENTIRE video is to TEACH french, and Baby Einstein is mainly images and music, NOT enough spoken french at ALL. I am finding trouble finding ANTOHER dvd like Brainy Baby. I would like more of these."
3,Try it - it's okay,"This item is definitely more useful than it is not. After only 3 viewings, my almost 3-year could count to 20 in French and his 20-month-old brother started labelling objects in French. I was amazed as French will be their third language.My only reservation now is that I do hear the non-French accent coming out when they speak. My French is very good, but of course they think the DVD's perfect and don't think Mom knows what she's talking about! So, I'm looking for a slightly more advanced product geared towards young pre-schoolers..."
5,Excellent Introduction,"the tape is simple with limited vocabulary. It is organized well with lots of smiling children and songs interspersed between the vocabulary. My one year old granddaughter can count for five on her fingers in French, thanks to this group. I wish I could find subsequent tapes in the series.Tre Bien!"
4,A SOPHISTICATED MASCULINE SCENT,"For me, a classic is something of which I never tire. That's surely the case with this men's cologne.Kouros, the classic figure of a Greek youth, in all probability an athlete, is an apt name for this scent from Saint Laurent. It's vigorous, dynamic and free-spirited.A combination of a woodsy fragrance and spicy notes make it popular - a man's cologne with scent-appeal.The container is trim, rather stately, reminiscent of a Greek column"
1,Doll not expected to arrive in time,"for my grandson's surgery, which I had paid for, so how can I possibly rate it? Am extremely disappointed in the timing of this and will not order from this vendor again (Orange Onions). A companion book, from a different vendor, actually came a day earlier than noted, and that was a delight, but this is just unconscionable."
3,Fabulous writing and images. Get a first edition,"An earlier reviewer criticized this 9x6 inch paperback version of this lovely book. I can only agree that such a size does not do justice to Porter's beautiful photographs of Penobscot Bay and its islands, his touching autobiographical chapters in the first half of the book, or the lovingly chosen poems in the second half. The 1966 edition published by the Sierra Club is fantastic, carefully printed on thick glossy stock."
4,All purpose Fujifilm CD,"For those who have non-computer type devices which copies music, data, or other types of media on blank CD's, These are highly recommended. I have one of those recorders that makes CD's from (don't laugh) actual vinyl LP's. and the only kind of blank CD it will accept are these ""All Purpose CD's"" made by Fujifilm. I used to be able to buy them at Frys Electronics, but no longer available there. Thank goodness I can still buy them on Amazon.com. So yes I do highly recommend this product."
4,One of the great steel benders,"Liked his simple approach to using everyday items to work out with. He is one of the strongest. He has a very down to earth approach to gaining strength. He doesnt recommend a lot of expensive equipment,and supplements. Deffently recomend it."
3,Mastery of Hand Strength,"This is a very good book for anyone wanting to improve his grip for whatever reason but has no idea how to do it besides the usual grippers and wrist curls. I shows you lots of different ways to improve your different types of grip for an overall better performance. I opens your eyes in terms of equipment you can make by yourself. What it lacks though, is in terms of application, it doesn't say much about how to use the exercies, how much rest, how to combine, etc. Anyway is a good buy if you have no idea how to begin."
5,Great book about overall grip strength,"This book is a great resource for learning about developing balanced grip strength. I have heard of some of the exercises mentioned before(farmers walks, grippers) but there were many moves that were surprising to me(sledgehammers, screwdrivers). Brookfield covers all aspects of grip strength and gives examples of moves to train the attributes. There are atleast 3 or 4 choices for each type of move, so it's fairly easy to implement into your training. Brookfield also suggests different exercises for different types of athletes such as football players, martial artists, gymnasts, etc. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about grip training and developing an amazing grip."
4,Great Info on a Very Specific Topic,"I bought this book because of my interest in competitive arm wrestling. I read it cover to cover today after it arrived in the mail. It's very interesting if you're interested in this topic, and after all, how many books are out there on this particular topic? Not too many. I just got back from the gym after trying out six of the exercises outlined in the book, and I got a great pump in my hands and forearms."
3,Excellent account of The Battle of Okinawa,A very detailed book on the entire operation. Deals mainly with the military stragedy of the opposing forces. Shows the Japenese experience very well.
1,don't buy this book-cruel and disgusting,"I was appalled this book is targeted to young children. The child is pictured painting with the blood of crushed cockroaches. Another child is bound to a tree and teased with bumblebees. With cruel, sadistic messages like this, what can this author say about friendship that I want my child to read? Not only a book that shouldn't be bought, this book should not be sold."
5,An excellent book to ease the hurt of moving for young child,"An excellent book about a young girl, who is moving away, and her best friend, who is trying to deal with it. Author, Leah Komaiko, captures the saddness and fears that young children face when a good friend moves to another town. The illustrations also are spectacular. Laura Cornell briliantly helps tell the tale through her beautiful illustrations. A wonderful edition to any child's bookshelf."
4,"Pleasure to read, our 4-yr old loved this story!","Though I'm sure our daughter picked the book initially for the colorful photos from the library, we all came to enjoy this story. Given the subject, we found the text silly and fun. This book seemed to be a good tool not only for understanding the loss of a friend moving but also for understanding the value of true good friends. I enjoyed the imaginative antics of the two friends and the creative illustrations."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,"I heard about this book from Jamie Lee Curtis. I don't know her personally, but in an interview she said it was this book that inspired her to start writing. So I decided to check it out. AND IT IS WONDERFUL. A sweet tale of friendship, I've not only given it to children as a gift, but sent it to a college roomate for her 40th birthday. The text is original, touching and funny and the illustrations a perfect complement. I was/am such a fan that I have purchased several of Komaiko's other books as well."
1,Whattt!!,"Maybe I have a "" off"" copy. You are basically watching a class preform this art in a choppy no explaination fashion. The production is just pathetic, sound quality horrible. The camera operator needs to learn how to film, If your wanting to learn this art like I am , theres no way to learn from this set. Dont waste your money. This is the second awful production by Mr Alexander that Ive had the misfortune of buying. He needs to quit charging people for this.If I could return this I would. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS."
1,Disappointment.,"This man wrote this book to whine over other scholars that disagree with him, to make the reader an accomplice of his thinking. I think that he needs a Psychiatrist!The two or three interesting ideas could be written on a newspaper short article and even that would leave you thinkingthat such information is good for nothing but to fantasize over a mother tongue that common sense will see at the best dubious.The book is also boring.Howcome people like this can be regarded as a specialist?"
2,A little shallow,"I hoped a more scientific book, it starts with too many assumptions, but I have like and I think is worth reading it, at least reading it, since it's not a book to consult frquently."
4,An excellent guide but failed to reach the destination,"This is one of the best guide book for anyone who wonders ""where are we from?"" However, the author leaves us unanswered as to ""The Origin of Language"" like all other linguists who tried to explain us in vain.Nevertheless, his argument against Roman Jakobson's hypothesis on ""mama"" and ""papa"" is very convincing. And, moreover, his special attention to other kin terms like ""kaka"" gives us a meaningful suggestion how to cope with the obstacles on our road in search of the origin of our mother tongue.Nobody can deny his theory that the global languages share the same origin because another kin term ""abba"" which means ""father"" in English and Syriac, means also ""father"" in Korean as well as in Chinese, Hungarian (pronounced <apa>), and ""abbe"" in French. In short, we owe him thousands of thanks for his wonderful work which lead us very close to our ultimate goal."
4,Excellent,"I found this book worthy. Contrary to what some of Ruhlen's critics would have you believe, this is not a SCIENCE BOOK, rather it is a book ABOUT A SCIENCE. As such, he has the freedom to speculate and draw on analogies, even though most analogies are flawed on some level. All in all, it gives us a plausible hypothesis on the development of early language. His theory of an early ""Eurasian"" language is acceptable for the purpose of discussion. It opens a door for new inquiry, which is what a hypothesis does, after all. Today, there is a good bit of 'catholic' wisdom that resists any idea that threatens long-held tenets; but, this book lets some light into the musty halls of academia."
2,The Origin of Language,"I was rather disappointed with this book. The text format was not ""user friendly""; I prefer to see visual organizers to help for a more systematic presentation of this very fascinating topic."
2,Disappointed,"This book was a great disappoint to me. I was hoping to get tools for our family to use to resolve small disputes. Instead, this book is just stories about the author's life. Instead, I recommend ""The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work"" by Dr. John Gottman."
4,Need companion copy of National Directory for Catechesis,"I read the General Directory for Catechesis as part of a seminar class. I had an instructor and fellow students to help me read the GDC and make sense of it. Reflecting the ideas from this book with the National Directory of Catechesis was critical to my understanding of the Church's international direction for religious education. The GDC tells you the Church's international plan for religious education, and the NDC applies it to the American situation. I recommend buying them together. That said I was pleased to learn the Church puts adult catechesis above all else and considers all other religious education activities to radiate from the primary emphasis on grown-ups!"
5,A Catechetical Gem,"I had to purchase this book for a course I was taking. It has really come in handy outside of the course. I am also a catechist and use this book when planning lessons. It clarifies some of the deeper points found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. By referring to this book, I am able to better understand a lesson topic and in that way can teach a better lesson because I know the material better. If you are a catechist or someone looking to understand the Faith better, this is a useful reference book."
4,Very informative,This book is very informative yet entertaining. It tells all about the problems people who are learning English as a Second language face when in America. There are many stories of experiences Leki has had with her students. This book is important for anyone who works with ESL students.
5,cool race car indeed,"i got this lego set a while back, and it is the coolest thing.I love lego, they are the best!the minifigure is actually a ninja!!!!!!at least the driver has a ninja face!the car could be a little faster but it's cool anyways"
4,Care Bears Sticker book,"I think this is a great little activity book for kids learning shapes, colors and how to find items with in pictures. Its lots of fun to do together with your kids!"
4,"Fun, imaginitive, durable","These toys wash up well and are loads of fun. The children love to make up new animal creations with the different pieces. Like Shep, however, the Velcro adheres pretty well--don't expect a 1-year-old to be able to separate these toys. Children old enough to separate the pieces will love the bright colors and the fanciful combinations."
3,Older text than indicated,"I was disappointed to find, having bought this book (used), that it is an older version than is indicated. This book (87044-014-4) is the 1966 revised edition last copyrighted in 1974."
2,Don't judge this book by its cover,"(Really 2 and 1/2 stars.) The Lois Meade series has wonderful cover art, but this novel doesn't live up to the promise of its cover. Just as in the first outing of the series, ""Murder on Monday,"" the plot is incoherent and the solution challenges belief--and Lois does very little actual detection. Lois's relationships to her husband and to her police connection fail to ring true. And I wonder about the ""lower class"" stereotyping.However, in spite of all the above, Ms. Purser creates a very nice atmosphere apart from the ""mystery,"" and Lois can be amusing in spite or because of all her feistiness. Individual scenes can be quite well observed.If you are looking for a way to while away a few hours in the atmosphere of an English village, and don't mind the plot and characters which occasionally teeter on the edge of unbelievability, give this series a try. Look elsewhere for a book with a tighter plot, believable action, and a reasonable solution."
2,give it a miss,"Lois Meade is the least likeable character to come into British fiction in a long time. She is combative, unfriendly, unappreciative of her mother, and rude to everyone she meets. She is angry all the time and never pleasant to anyone. The mysteries she solves usually turn out to be accidents or natural deaths, and are easy to figure out. The ony reason to read these books is for the interesting village characters around her, but Lois is certainly the least interesting person in the village."
4,"""Terror on Tuesday""","This 2nd book in the British village cleaner series lives up to the promise of the first. I enjoy series mysteries as much for the growth and changes in the characters as for the whodunnit aspects, and this series does not disappoint. Looking forward to finishing out the week with Lois and her merry bunch."
2,Better to look elsewhere,"Obviously, you have to respect Bill Inmon's work in the Data Warehouse industry but I don't consider this book one of his better efforts. It's rather short at 250 pages and there is plenty of filler from the oversize glossary to weak chapters on data mining and the politics of exploration processing. There are also a couple of chapters(Corporate Information Factory description, Chain of Beneficence)devoted to topics that have been published in many places and can be easily found, for free, on the net. The core Exploration Warehouse technology chapters are a bit dated as this technology is rapidly expanding. Overall, a very valuable technology but most of the same information can be found somewhere else on the Web."
3,Not as good as the real thing,"While this is a reasonably good Lounge Noir production, I find it dissapointing compared to ""the summit"" recordings or other live recordings of the Rat Pack . They were a live act, and a record like this does not do justice to the original performers. Certainly not a good introduction to these Cats as individual artists or a performing act. Check out Sinatra at the Sands or the summit concert to get a feeling of what these guys were all about. I enjoyed ""Fly me to the Moon"" and other standards, but I didn't like the presence of ""Strangers in the Night"" on this record - a Sinatra song that POST-dates the Rat Pack ! Worth having for the couple of bucks, but not an essential for the collection !"
1,Is this really Sky ?,"I have most of the early Sky albums. Quite by accident I found ""Mozart"" and bought it without listening to it first. After the first listening I thought that there must be a mistake and that someone inserted accidentally a ""Rondo Veneziano"" or similar Muazk stuff in a Sky CD case. I was wrong. To be honest, I am very disappointed with this CD. This work is ages away from their great Works, Sky 1, Sky 2 and Sky 3. As one of the previous reviewers stated: I ask myself: How could Sir Neville Marriner agree to participate here ??? If I would not know that this is a Sky Album I would really think it is a ""Rondo Veneziano"" album."
4,Long Live Barbarian Brothers!,"This movie is awesome. John and David Paul are my reason for living! I would be a cop if it were as cool as it is in this movie. Or a criminal. My favorite line, ""Politicians are great people, ...everybody should own one."" The way it just rolls off his tongue. Just don't watch this movie with someone who doesn't understand the Barbarian Brothers as you will have to beat them unmercifully!"
4,The reason why it didn't get 5 star rating is because...,"While the plot and script of this movie is written very well, the reason why it didn't get a 5 star rating from me is because of the cast. The Barbarian brothers are cool, they deserved atleast a nomination to the oscars. The problem is due to the babes in this movie... there weren't any. They should have casted hotter chicks to off-set the actions. My favorite re-occuring line from this movie is ""Can't find Second Gear..."", if you watch it you'll understand. Paul and David should make a comback ""Double Trouble 2"", if I was a producer, I'd fund it!"
3,Silly Munster tv-movie.,"This TV-movie was an attempt to recapture the beloved Munsters tv series. Fred Gwynn, Yvonne DeCarlo, and Al Lewis returned as the monster family, with newcomers playing Eddie and Marilyn. The plot involved Grampa and Herman being mistaken for ""the monster muggers,"" who are robots from Sid Caesar's Wax Museum. Though its' not up to the standards of the original tv series, this is the last time Gwynn, Lewis, and DeCarlo would appear together on film as The Munsters again."
2,it is litttle good but still a bad flim,this migt be worth wacing somtimes but not all the time i dint reely care for this the truth about this show is to try to beat with a other monster the addams family which came first before this show this rely is not that good a rip of show that is stupid if you whant somthing that is good go see the addams family you will be glad you did
3,The last nail in the Munsters coffin by NBC,"This is the last time the Munsters were seen together, and in a very bad NBC 'Made for TV' movie at that (shame on you NBC!!).In a Nut Shell...Munsters are honored in a wax museum, but the evil owner of the wax museum decides to incorporate robotics into the wax figures of the Munsters and the rest of the exhibits and have them perform criminal activity. And when the police go looking they arrest the real versions.The make-up is nowhere as good as the 1960's ""Munster Go Home"" movie, but if you are Munster fan like myself, you need to have this in your collection."
2,El Peor Editado/ The Worst Edition Job,"Español:Esta novela es la mejor !!! Pero en el DVD cortaron MUCHAS escenas romanticas de Bruce y Rosita, Julia y Diosdado !!! Y muchas mas... Yo hubiera preferido pagar mas para que la novela estuviera completa... Que decepcion es este DVD...English:This soap opera is the best !!! But in the DVD they edited MANY romantic scenes of Bruce and Rosita, Julia and Diosdado!!! And many more... I would had preferred to pay more, so the soap would be complete... This DVD is a big dissapointment ..."
1,Dame Chocolate,"This review does not concern the actual Telenovela; that is superb.This review concerns the fact that the product received is not what I expected, by any stretch of the imagination. I only wish I had read the reviews of this product BEFORE I bought it. If I had, I would never have bothered. This is an abridged version of the Novela. It is SO abridged that it is nearly unrecognizable. Over HALF of the original episodes are cut out and the rest are edited. Shame on Telemundo. If you're going to release the thing, at least release the ENTIRE thing."
2,Confusing!,"I love the story line as it was presented on TV, so I bought the DVD. The person(s) that edited this on to DVD should be fired. I realize they had to shorted the story but the cut out too many important scenes. The acting is great, the story was great and it does improve your spanish, but it was reduced in quality by the awful editing. They completely missed the overall story.Me encanto la novela cuando la vie por tele, y lo compre. Las personas que cortaron la novela la convertiron en un disastre!"
4,Dame Chocolate,"I really enjoyed watching the DVD's. The only complaint that I have is that too much was edited out. I would have liked to have seen more of the story with Rudy and more detail of the ending (ie: Mauricio/Hortencia, Rudy, etc.) I would have been willing to spend a little more to get more detail."
3,Boring,"I bought this book based on the other reviews. I have tried to get my 2nd grader to read it but she can't get beyond page 10. I have tried twice to read it to my kids, but I can never get to the end because they are completely bored. Maybe I have to own a llama to appreciate this story."
4,Jump rope,"I love the jump rope. I am using it in a fitness program. My only problem is that I am only 5'2"" and it is long for me. I had trouble finding shorter ropes that where good. I wish this had a shorter version avaiable."
3,Bad Rope,"I bought this rope about 2 weeks ago. Im trying to loose some weight before I travel abroad and I decided that Jump Rope would be a great way to loose weight, which it is. I bought the GoFit Speed Rope and it broke in the 3rd use. just snapped in half by the rope.... For me it was a waste of my money, and I'll be staying away from GoFit products in the future.****** UPDATE******My original review was at 1 star but I have moved it up to 3. This is because of the customer service I received from GoFit. I complained to their customer service and received an email and a phone call apologizing for the poor product. Then to make up for it they sent me 5 jump ropes in a package via UPS. Pretty great CS."
2,Broken,This rope was OK...while it lasted. I used it for a two day a week outdoor fitness class this summer and it actually broke at the handle on the last day of class. I'll be getting a Buddy Lee rope to replace it.
3,Time Cat,This book was okay but tended to jump from part to part quickly with no flow. It was confusing in parts and they made no attempt not to affect history. They unrealistacly were able to easily change everyone into lovers of cats. The book though did contain some historic figures and facts. I would recommend this book for people grades 4-6.Lloyd Alexander though has written many good books this isn't one of the good ones though.
2,Pages of nothing,"I HATED this book! Hated hated hated! It was stupid. The chapters are boring and don't go anywhere. Not enough information is given.Worst of all, Gareth AND Jason are bossy. Jason gives everyone he meets a stern lecture on cat care. The Japanese emporer can't even dress his cats without Jason's ""opinions"".Gareth is just as bad. He doesn't act like a cat-he acts like a father! God, shut up both of you! They both make the whole book one long educationl cesspool.The ending is just as bad. Gareth gets lectury about how Jason needs to ""grow up."" If anything, Jason needs to loosen up ...This was such a bad book. I could go on and on. Don't buy it unless you want to build up a lot of rage."
3,time cat,"time cat is defenitly not my favorite book, but its good. Its about a cat named Gereth and a boy named Jason.Gereth cant only talk, but he can travel through time, as well. He takes Jason time traveling to Egypt, which isthe first of nine adventures they go on together."
2,Alexander Disappoints,"If you loved the Prydain Chronicles then don't buy this book. This effort is lackluster at best. Alexander offers a disjointed, unconnected narrative that is at the very least unsatisfying and disappointing. While Alexander's notion of a time travelling cat has merit, his execution lacks the punch of his other writing. The historical vignettes aren't drawn out to their full potential despite the alluring historical figures Alexander places Jason and Gareth beside, nothing materializes. It's certainly not that I hated this work, I didn't, it's just that I can't fathom why I'd ever read it again. To me, that's the most disappointing thing of all if you've loved Alexander's previous works."
4,Student Review - Chirs G.,"I enjoyed reading Time Cat. In Time Cat every chapter is like a mini-book. Personally, I enjoyed the end of a book because, it was a climax. At the climax Jason and Gareth were in American colonial times and I wasn't sure what was going on. Then, all of a sudden, they started climbing a sloping hill and were one their way home. The book is also one of my favorite genres, Historical Fiction. Overall, I would give this book ****."
5,Travel Trough Time!,"Wow! I started this book thinking I would hate it, but I love it! I am still reading the book but it is really good so I have to write a reveiw now.The book is about a cat named agreth who can talk to his owner and use up his nine lives to go on nine adventures. Jason, his owner, finds out about this and the second he does, he is in Ancient Egypt, 2700 B.C.. Now, Jason is taken captive from the Pharaoh and tries to get out. Jason is then let out to show King Neter-Khet (the pharaoh) how to treat cats. The king lets Jason and Gareth go. Gareth winks at Jason and they travel further in time to Great Britain and Rome, 55 B.C.Catch up on Jason and Gareth's other adventures in the book. I highly recomend it!"
3,so-so book,it was ok...I didn't really get that much out of it but that's just me. maybe better for someone else.
4,Special needs kids,I have used this cd with my special needs students. It is a powerful tool in soothing children at whatever age. The original tape I used was from a hospital neo-natal unit. Great product.
3,Good CD don't quite get the therapy part,I have a baby who's now 4 mos. old and does not like to fall asleep. In the newborn stage he literally barely slept at all so at my wits end I started researching alternative methods to soothe him to sleep. (I'm still trying to figure it out) We've added this CD to our nightly rocking and it's nice but I don't necessarily think it has worked any miracles for us. I think we both enjoy it though so it hasn't been a waste.
5,Great cd worked great oo,"I was given this has a gift from WIC, Itried ti the first night within two weeks my baby was sleeping through the night shes now 14 months old and she goes to bed at 7pm and stays alsleep till 9 am, it was great when I switched her frim breast to bottle ti really calmed her down,,,"
1,Is my baby in the 6% that doesn't fall asleep w/this CD?,"When I read all of these amazing reviews about how this CD put the baby to sleep AND put the dog to sleep, I thought that I had to try it. I got the CD when my daughter was six months old, and I have been trying it for the past month. I can honestly tell you that it has not helped her AT ALL. She does not like to go to sleep on her own, and the CD has not changed that. It doesn't seem to calm her down to listen to it, and it certainly doesn't make her fall asleep. I hope that the CD will work for your child, but please don't expect a miracle."
4,4.5* Exciting Heroine...,"As my 1st Hannah Howell this Highlander story is quite wonderful and full of fun. The one who make it is definitely the Heroine...Gillyane, although the Hero is not so remembering later on, but still this story is worth to finish.The only complain I had is maybe the type of 'Font' in the book I bought, that keep me difficult to digest the story starting middle to end...If I had to compare this highlander, I choose better Julie Garwood's or Karen Marie Moning..."
5,Highland Bride,"I love all the books in this series and there are alot, but Gilly *Highland Bride* is one of my all time favorites! You get romance, comedy, action, suspense and not to mention plenty of hot Scots! lol"
3,Brogue is so thick...,that i couldn't enjoy it fully. I enjoyed the spunky and wise heroine though. To see married love thrive from the canny work of a loving wife is encouraging.
4,"BEDDING,BEDDING AND MORE BEDDING","I would have given this book 4&1/2 stars. This is the first Hannah Howell book I have read and I might read some more? I did like the story very much and the good strong characters were great. They seemed to have great sex but by the end of the book I was a little tired of the constant bedding. I would recommend this book because of the strong characters, personal challenges, mystery and the steamy sex scenes. Enjoy"
5,highland bride,Highland BrideI liked it very much! Good storyline and it makes me want to buy all Hannah Howell's books during same approximate time period and setting (excepting the vampire stories).
3,I don't know what's wrong,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I wasn't all that wild about this book. I thought it had potential, but just never came together for me. I liked Connor and thought Howell did a good job with him. Maybe what I really don't like is that Gillyanne (and all Howell's heroines) was so tiny. That was stressed over and over--how tiny she was, almost childlike. I think that sort of subconsciously icked me out. Now, romance novel heroines don't have to be Amazons, but I don't like getting a mental picture of a 12 year old. I think that is what kept happening and prevented me from liking this book very much. Come on, next time, have your heroine be at least as big as a 15 year old!!"
3,Not so nice scent,The orange cinnamon scent smells better when the candle is not lit. Once you light the candle and it burns for a while it smells like chemicals. Would not purchase this scent again.
5,Awesome book!,Really great book if your in to science and history. It gives a short and to the point description of every invention. From the beginning of life on earth (stuff we can't know for sure) and more recent scientifically proven stuff. A must have for any fans of science or anybody that's curious and doesn't have a scientific mind.
3,Dearly departed...,"I feel guilty for not giving the late Stephen Bruton a higher rating, but I feel this is a competent, not great CD. I enjoy his understated playing and singing, but this CD just didn't get over the hump to that level of greatness that I think he was capable of achieving. Still, it's a pretty good CD, particularly if you're one of his fans."
1,"Quality hose, but did not fit.","Very flexible and quality hose.But the connection is too small for my Waterpik shower head/bracket. It'd be nice if it specified. Since it's shipped from Hong Kong, it's not worth it for me to return it. =("
1,A very short lived product,"This hose burst within 45 days of when I ordered it. The Plumb Shop warrantees it for only 30 days. I didn't keep track of the date that I received the hose or the date that I installed it; so they refused to provide any further service. I have a family of three; so usage is light. This is a total waste of money.Plumb Shop Div Brasscraft #682-812 MP 59"" Stainless Steel Shower Hose"
4,"Simple, it works, and is a fraction the cost of Grohe original","After experiencing a break in the original Grohe hose after five years of infrequent use and finding that an OEM replacement was around $75 even through online sources, we bagged the Grohe name and bought this for about 1/5th price. It doesn't have exactly the same connector design, but everything else about the hose looks fine, and how many times does one look at a shower hose connector?"
1,"Locks up without reason, poor mouse design",I've had this product for not quite a week and I'm sending it back. Numerous times the mouse and keyboard have suddenly lost reception and stop working; trying to reconnect doesn't work. The tracking for an optical mouse is terrible and the design is uncomfortable. Sorry Microsoft...stick to software.
1,A+ Certified PC Repair Technician: This Product Sux,I'm a PC repair technician with a plus certification among many other certs and I have the worst time getting this device to work. Please be aware of this product and don't waste your time or hair.
3,POOR RECEPTION!!!,"I have two of these wireless keyboards in our home office. The first one worked well for over a year. I just bought a second one identical to the first one. NOW, I'm always getting a weak signal and the signal strenth window comes on at least 10 times a day. Even my older keyboard has the same problem. I called Microsoft and they said there would not be a problem using two wireless keyboards near each other. I find this hard to believe. This really bugs. The battery life is good. I think I my have to return it for the Logitech MX Duo."
5,One of the greatest Card's novel,"I love the heroin, and the story is awesome.There is almost too much ideas for such ashort book...Card creates a fascinating new world wherenothing is exactly what it seems... Definitelyone of the best read i've ever had..."
2,Heavy-handed,"This would be a much better read if you ignored all the heavy-handed allegory about mastering your passions with your will and controlling your desires so that they can be sublimated into the fabric of community and the act of marriage, blah, typical Card stuff, and just read it as a story about a girl who wants to have sex with a giant bug. I'm serious--it would be much better."
3,Interesting but ...,"This book is a fairly interesting and engrossing read, albeit with the aforementioned yucky scene later on. An interesting plot with lots of twists and turns and surprises. And written in Card's now-familiar style.However, after I had finished it and digested it more, it felt as though Card was trying to be too clever with his reversals and toying with our expectations ... trying too hard to be too ""wise."" And that stuck with me as kind of annoying, actually. Thus the reduced stars. Still, worth a read."
4,Amazing,"I'm not a Card sycophant, but every time I read one of his books I'm blown away. The complexity of the stories is mind-boggling. Even the simplest stories ends up with heavy philosophical thought. I actually had to stop reading and think about the concepts presented.Not a bad story either. Card gives epic fantasy a shot."
3,Card -- Not his best work,"Patience is the rightful Heptarch (ruler) of Imakulata. She is the seventh of the seventh of the seventh of rulers, and has been prophesied that she will either destroy or save all of mankind. Now at 15 years old she feels the cranning call. The irresistable urge to go to skyfoot, and meet her destiny. Even she doesn't know if she will be the messiah, or the anti-Christ of their world?Card is a fantastic story teller, and this book is no exception from his ability to do just that. I was unimpressed with the story itself, but the way Card develops characters, and expresses intelligent ideas is unparalleled. I guess I just didn't like the idea of a young girl be driven with passion to meet and mate with an alien worm-creature."
1,"For Card fans, a let down","As an Orson Scott Card fan from way back, I have enjoyed his other forays into the graphic novel genre (e.g. Red Prophet and Iron Man), but Wyrms disappoints on many levels. Based on an older Card work (before he really found his voice in my opinion), Wyrms is the story of a journey of a female assassin to her destiny. There is a typical range of traveling companions, representing the distinct species groups found on the planet. The picture of the graphic novel cover shows one cool idea, the ability of the dead to speak when their heads are preserved, but even this is not carried through enough in the story. The story is somewhat incoherent, and the drawing failed to convey the difference between some characters (i.e. I couldn't always tell who was who).I am not able to recommend this graphic novel, either for fans of the genre or fans of the original novel."
1,Gruesome.,"I like some of Card's other books so much I feel bad complaining about this one. But I hated this book so much that I couldn't read anything by Card for two years because the ""flavor"" of his writing reminded me of ""Wyrms."" I don't think I've ever had this strong of a negative reaction to a book; the strength of my reaction may say something positive about the book, but all I can say is, I hated it.I loved Ender's Game, and a lot of other stuff Card has written, but this book gave me nightmares. Really"
4,Another good read from Orson Scott Card,"We enjoyed this book. I was happy to get it, even though it's out of print."
5,Another Card magnificent,"This is an example of Card's greatness. He writes a story about a 13 year-old girl who has the whieght of the world on her. She is supposed to kill an irresitible enemy. It is about her quest. The enemy (wyrm) is able to influnce thought to the point of making people come to him. they are on a different planet with 3 main species. the Wyrm is the third. It is a great plot with great charecters. A very good, and quick, read."
3,"Graphic novel, not a real Book","I bought Wyrms along with two other novels, and was suprised to recieve a comic book (Graphic Novel). I prefer real novels, but read it anyway, it only took 40 minutes. I do like OSC and own many of his books. This is not a bad story, but I wish that it had been listed as a graphic novel rather than a Trade Paperback. I'll be a lot more careful with future orders."
3,The Immaculate Conception of the Spotless Mind,"This book is not the ussual Card book. It is a simple and interesting interpretation of the immaculate conception and the building blocks of christianity as projected by Card on the Age of Space Travel.Card, who likes to touch major ethical questions in Theology (Ender's role in the universe as destroyer and builder of worlds, The battle between Justice and Mercy in the worthing Saga, Etc...) chooses to confront the whole issue of the immaculate conception in the form of a parable about planet Imakulata.Most of the characters' names are symbolic and the novel is full with alegories to the bible.Card uses this fertile ground to discuss the universal role of religion and christianity in perticular, the importance of immortality in religion as a deep desire of humanity, and the concept of the intergrated mind and consciousness.This novel is well worth a read, but it is not the best of Orson's work."
4,This book will gross you out in an entertaining way,This is a very weird book. I don't want to spoil it for you but it reminded me of a certain similiarly titled British horror film. The interaction between humans and animals that Card experimented with in the mid-80's reaches its zenith in this story. Read it on an empty stomach. The story is also little depressing - typical Card grimness from his middle period. You might need a box of tissues. Then go re-read Speaker for the Dead
1,Subpar Card fantasy with child sexual abuse,"I like Card, and I hated Wyrms. The plot hangs on the hero's raping a barely postpubescent girl in public in order to become heir to her father's throne. The plot goes downhill from there. This book brings out Card's abused-child motif over and over again; it's really difficult to read, and I don't think the payoff makes it worthwhile."
1,Disgusting Book! Do not read!,"Don't read this book unless you want to puke for the rest of your life. I wish I'd never read it; I tore my copy in half and threw it in the dumpster. If this story became a movie, it would be rated X. If you want to read some good Orson Scott Card, read Pastwatch."
1,The Most Disgusting Book Ever,"With the amount of time Card spends on the reprodutive abilities of aliens, I seriously begin to doubt him. This book had potential, up unto the point where the girl started lusting after bugs. EW! EW! EW! This book was incredibly horrible, especially towards the end and just plain wrong. I suppose if someone having sex with bugs appeals to you then you should read this book but otherwise, STAY FAR FAR AWAY!"
3,Ok but not fantastic,"We purchased this for my 2 and a half year old this past Christmas as he is all about planes and motorcycles right now, and this was the only set I found that had both. The planes hold up fine, mostly. Right out of the box, the stickers were peeling off. Probably not a big deal to my son, but a bit disappointing to me. The motorcycle was a complete disappointment. Right out of the box, the kickstand and the mufflers continually fell off, so we put them in a plastic baggie for safe keeping. My son likes the limo and big plane the most out of this set. I think if it had been cheaper, I'd be less disappointed, but since he still plays with the items, I can't be too hard on the set."
2,Lens Pen? I don't think so,"This is a cheap ""COPY"" of the original Lens Pen. The ad says Lenspen BY ""Lenspen"" It works ok, but I have the original in my bag as well which is better. I thought I was buying what the ad claims to be the original. This is not it. Not really worth sending back, just be aware that what you get is a Knock off and not the original."
3,Basic Book To Learn Korean,"This book isn't really good for people who are really interested in the Korean language, mainly for foreign travelers. I find the hangul alphabet section to basic, not in depth enough to learn. There's a lot of traveling phrases, so this book is basically the best for travelers."
3,MGM Review,"A two cd item. First disk I felt was fine... second disk ok. I have heard other albums from the ""golden"" age of movies & movie themes that were more interesting. For the avid old time movie buff it would be worthwile for their collection."
1,Awful Christmas CD,"There is really only one song worth hearing. Even my daughter's don't seem to care for this, other than the Miley Cyrus song."
4,Lousy quality AND customer service,"I bought this pool last summer, followed all directions, kept the pool in sparkling condition, but when I went to use it this year, it has sprung three leaks so far! I contacted Intex, and they said, ""We can't guarantee that the vinyl won't crack or split when it's exposed to sunlight""!!!! Oh, I didn't realize that I was supposed to set up this pool inside! Give me a break! I will NEVER purchase another Intex product if this is the kind of quality and customer service they provide. BUYER BEWARE. . . ."
2,Spent my summer cleaning the Pool,"First, the setup of the pool was fairly easy. Leveling the ground is very important. That was the only easy part of owning this pool. The upkeep and maintenance has been a nightmare. The pumping system is not able to clean the pool and does not move the water enough. Even running the pump 24 hours a day does not help. I have had to add chemicals daily and still not able to maintain water quality. The vacuuming system also falls very short of being satisfactory. The combination of a weak pumping system and poor vacuum system leaves you not in the pool swimming but trying to clean the pool as best you can."
3,Had this pool for 3 seasons,"Had to throw it away after last summer. The inflatable ring had broken down over the years from the heat which caused many holes. Inflatable ring, not very durable. Pump that came with it was not powerful enough to to keep up with the demand. My family of 5 were the only ones to use and the water had a constant chemical imbalance no matter what I did to it. We often had to run the pump overnight, and we had to constantly sweep the bottom of the pool because the dirt would settle to the bottom. It would constantly leak and we never did figure out were it was leaking from, probably from the seams. This is a design that needs to go back to the drawing board!! I did get three years out of it, but was hoping for at least 5!"
4,green and greener,"i have this pool, but the filter is way to small for its use you cant get it to stay a good color itll turn gren on you in no time"
5,Great Zagat's Style Book for Golf Courses,"Although this book only covers the West Coast of Florida, I find it useful every weekend looking for information on new courses to play. Some of the coupons are great and others are somewhat limiting (have restrictions). The Architect index is great! I am looking forward to an East Coast edition. I highly recommend this to everyone."
3,Don't purchase for the Coupons,Many of the coupons in this book are expired--Don't purchase with the expectation that the coupons will be of value.
4,Sweetheart of a heroine helping another tortured hero...,"This is a switch from the usual since Gates has over-come so much in her unhappy life. She sees magic in the little everyday things, like a spider building a web, dragon fly wings, etc. While the hero has been undone by his miserable parents and life in general. All the main characters are so great. I loved Griffin's younger brothers, Cort and Scotty. Sir Thomas, Lady Min, Aunt Delphie are wonderful added characters to the story, even Gaspar his abused, lovable horse. The story is original and in so many ways very different from the norm. I loved the surprise ending. Definitely recommend this book. Now to try to find ""Lord Monteith's Gift and more of her wonderful books."
1,A Dissapinmtnet,"I am surprised that this game has such high ratings. Based on these ratings I decided to try one of the few Visual Novels commerically released in the US. It was a big dissapointment, the characters are uninteresting, the story that I feel has so much potential with its time traveling plot succeeded in being really boring. Perhaps this might be worth it if you've never heard of Visual Novels before, however, if you are familiar with the Visual Novels by key such as Canon, Air, and Clannad you will be terribly dissapointed and shouldn't waste your time with this. I don't mind the spelling and grammar mistakes regulary appearing in the english translation, but if you are going to play this keep in mind that it might not work properly on a PC DVD player. Use a PS2 if you have one."
3,"Only OK, some quirks","Pros: Engaging storyCons: Controls/ scenes quirkyI probably wouldn't get one of these interactive DVDs again. I read the reviews and didn't expect full-on animation, but transition between even still-scenes is choppy, and tends to cut out the first subtitle for that scene. You can correct this by fiddling with the controls, but then the subs and the scene are mismatched. As mentioned by others, the password and other controls aren't intuitive. That said, it still marginally hold my interest due to the story. Problems might be solved with a different DVD player but mine is fairly ordinary and I don't feel I should have to get a new one or computer software just for this. I'd wait until interaction & scenes are improved before buying another. it IS a DVD after all."
2,You're Better Off With An Anime Version,"Love the story. Hate the user interface, especially the password system that hangs in the middle of your input. It violates everything that was taught by Human-Computer Interaction specialists and you can see how that turned out. I believe they wasted money on game developers who could do a lot better if they were given real games to work with.It's sad because the plot is top-notch."
5,Heart warming!,"Rugged rancher and widower Jake Henderson could have told you the exact day his life ended--it coincided with the day his wife was killed. Because for the longest time Jake felt that he wasn't really alive, either. And then came that invitation to dance--from a woman with the best pair of legs he'd ever seen. And looking up, he saw that she had a face to match...Suddenly Jake was falling fact, though he doubted that lovely investigator Rachel Quinn saw him as her ideal man--prime suspect was more like it! But if he could clear himself of the latter charge, could he still be convicted of the former?I could not put this book down. I was wonderful. Kept me guessing the whole time. Loved it!"
1,not pleased,it would be helpful to right a short summery of the story so pepole could know what the book is about.
1,Very Disappointed,"Since no one wrote a review to give me an idea on the quality of this product, I made the mistake of purchasing it. I just received this in the mail and I must say I am very disappointed. From reading the description, I expected 500 vocabulary flash cards but instead there are 33 cards with a bunch of similar and dissimilar words on the back. It was definitely not what I was looking for."
5,Helped significantly,"The flash cards helped me a lot. If you know how to use them, they will help you too. If it is hard for you to learn the words on the back of the cards, you should make pictures up on new notecards. I found that they helped me learn a lot of words that I was unfamilar with."
4,Bringing back an old era,"I'm sure that Murder She Wrote was a great watch. I have giftedit out to some of my friends. I remembering watching it a longtime ago (because I am getting older). However, now I needclosed captioning and it doesn't have it. If there are otherfamilies who want to share it with family members or other grownchildren, they should know that. There should be something onAmazon that tells people whether their old movies have ""closedcaptioning"" on it or not. It would save us some unnecessaryexpense in this escating expensive world we live in."
5,Murder She Wrote DVD's,"The collection of Murder She Wrote DVDs are marvelous. I like the dual-side recordings and the packaging. Before I got the DVDs I was always looking for re-runs on TV. Now, I have alot of them and will order more when I can."
4,murder she wrote,This was a Christmas present and it arrived right before Christmas wonderful and fast service very pleased and all for a reasonable price.
4,Well thought out,"LOTS of good substantive ideas and useful references, literally from A to Z. This book will definitely get well used."
1,Not the best resource.,"I did not find this to be very helpful in planning for my upcoming retirement. To be fair, I have looked at several retirement advice books and not found any to be of much help."
4,"Well done, concise summary.","Author Skinner provides an assessment of Machiavelli's ideas and writings, and the context of the times in which they were written. The problems of societies and states and the possible means and strategies for their governance has timeless resonance, of course. A well done mix of both biography and literary criticism. Recommended."
2,Too little about Machiavelli's context and influence,"This is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about Machiavelli's major works. What I wanted, however, was to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote, and I would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond Florence. If you understand references to the founding of Rome, to 15th century Papal politics, and have a good grounding in Livy, this book is for you. If, like me, what you wanted from a introduction to Machiavelli was to have someone explain Machiavelli's context and allusions, look elsewhere."
5,Harvard-approved,"James Hankins, professor of history at Harvard University, calls this book a ""masterpiece"" in his syllabus. That is high praise from a very reliable source. And I certainly cannot disagree!"
1,Did not work as advertied,I purchased this cable release after reading that it was compatible with my Fuji camera. I threaded it into the shutter only to find it would not work with my camera.
5,"Seminal, ground breaking, reader-friendly and effecitve.","Using Your Values To Raise Your Child To Be An Adult You Admire is written to help parents identify their own values; show them how to teach those values at different ages and stages; resolve conflicting values (their own as well as their parenting partner's); and to use values to solve family problems and meet normal developmental challenges. Using Your Values To Raise Your Child To Be An Adult You Admire a seminal, ground breaking, reader-friendly treatment of values as an effective parenting tool offering practical, ethical, and psychologically sound advice and counsel that will be greatly appreciate by parents of children from infancy to preschool to adolescence to young adult."
5,Time recieved was GREAT!,Compare to the other two items that I received which were suppose to arrive at the same time this one arrived first even before the timeframe I expected it.
2,:( Let Down,I couldn't even finish this film. Horrible sequel to an amazing classic. I couldn't wait to see this after watching Love Story....but I should've waited forever.
3,What I Expected,"Bought mainly to follow the Love Story, not crazy about Candice Bergen's performance. She is just so bland! O'Neal okay."
5,Should have been bigger,Great Album! Seems like so long ago but it still holds up today. This generation needs to be re-introduced to these guys.
4,Perhaps their best album,"Mott The Hoople / Mott: Although Mott The Hoople never managed to create a `masterpiece' album, this CD is the closest they ever came to it. ""All the way from Memphis"" is the big hit here. The rest of the album is good to very good, but most people would do best to get a greatest hits CD. Four Stars"
5,"Paint'em on the Nose of your Bomber, Flyboy!","If the Saturday Evening Post became a classic stag magazine, then it would be filled with the Gil Elvgren's pin-ups. My girlfriend framed the ""Bubbling Over"" postcard I sent her long ago and now it hangs in our bathroom!"
3,Good soprano!,"Great soprano, but not the same for the tenor. If you want to hear a good ""A tanto Duol"" buy the ""Music Teacher"" soundtrack.Instead, the ""Sorgi oh padre"" area and the final of the opera are wonderful song by the soprano Shin (in this complete opera)."
2,Like Drinking Perfume or Incense,"I was taken by the raving reviews of this product. Seven reviews and all seven rated the product with 5 stars. I thought this was amazing, so I bought the product and I have to wonder if the products producer didn't provide these ratings.I love green tea, but this is too much. If the floral was subdued it might be real nice, but this bold floral taste makes me feel like I'm drinking Mom's favorite perfume, or gargling with aftershave to cover-up bad breath.I don't know if I can develop a taste for this, but I almost have to, since I have 99 more cups to drink!"
2,Not what black metal fan expects,"A friend of mine advised me to give it a listen - he said it was a true Norvegian black metal. But what I heard was a kind of mixture between Therion and Bathory (i.e. symphonic power and viking doom). Though the music on this CD is not bad, I can not hear it from the beginning to the end, as the songs sound very much like each other and it's becoming boring. Also, after the listen you won't remember a single tune from it, and that means it is not worth to listen..."
3,Love-Hate Relationship With This Printer,"I've had a love-hate relationship with it the entire time I've owned it. It prints good quality, but (1)the ""cancel"" button has NEVER worked. This causes havoc when doing a printing project and I need to cancel. (2)It tells me I'm out of ink, while I still have ink! (3)It also grabs extra paper sometimes and prints part of the project on one page and part on another. BUT, it does do a good print job when it decides to not be temperamental. You decide!"
5,This is a Must See Movie,"Think you know what's going on with cell towers and the microwave radiation they put out? Most of us do not even notice the antennas that are hidden in church spires and flag poles, yet we do notice that we have trouble sleeping and other health problems. Full Signal takes you around the world to meet some of the people on the front line of this trillion dollar industry versus the power of the people battle. Watch the film and not only will you start recognizing the antennas all around you, but you will also learn the truth about radio frequency exposure and your and your family's health. This film will galvanize the world to take action to protect themselves."
5,Watch this Film! You Need to Know this Information!,"This is a film you need to see. If you are not aware of how dangerous cell phones are, this will be an eye-opening experience. We have to educate ourselves about the facts because the information about the dangers of cell phones is staggering. I have been studying this issue for years and it is time we had a film like this. Congratulations to the film makers for blowing the whistle on our planet's most urgent health concern."
5,Full Signal should be required viewing for everyone,"""Full Signal"" is an astonishingly well-made documentary about the dangers to public health resulting from cell antennas planted willy-nilly for profit, throughout cities, rural areas, etc., all to benefit Telecomm. industry, and clearly leaving mass populace vulnerable to cancer and other serious health problems. Film documents international resistance to these antennas, political alliances between industry and Congress in US, and shows numerous scientists and activists discussing specifics about health dangers. Superb."
5,Great Brazilian Ambience,"At a beach bar a few hours from Rio, I heard this wonderful CD, and was struck by the live cover of Caetano Veloso's ""O Leaozinho"". This is a live recording of acoustic guitar and vocals performing popular Brazilian songs, with the audience joining in from time to time, adding an incredible resonance and atmosphere to the recording. Lovely material, lovely vocals and altogether mesmerising. This is part of a 10 volume series, and I'm curious to hear some of the others."
5,i thought it was nice cause it has a lot of room,it was a nice design on the book and it is nice that it has so much room and it has room for you to draw and scribble or just play tic -tac-toe-.you can write storis like barbie meets godzilla or your favorite memories or your favorite days!
1,Quality Issues. Hard to Read Dice.,"Okay there are issues with this set.1) Quality Control Sucks. Every dice has a different amount of paint on each side, so it makes it very hard to quickly scan across 5 dice to read them, since you have to adjust for the lightness/darkness of the lettering.2) Labeling of KQJ - I guess there's some other language these dice use because while it's KQJ on one corner of the face, the other corner of the same face uses RDV. I'm probably missing something here, but again, it makes it hard to quickly scan the dice and figure out what you have. I'm used to KQJ.I guess there's a lot of them. so that's good. But I'm disappointed with the set that was so highly rated."
1,Unreadable guide to California,"I've used Moon Handbooks as a guide for my last few vacations, but Southern California by Kim Weir is the last one I will ever buy. The author's bias and political views are inappropriate for this type of book and laid on so thick that it's almost impossible to read more than a few pages at a time without retching. The background information doesn't even make California sound like a desirable place to visit!The only saving grace may be Moon's rich catalog of things to see and do, but this information is rendered untrustworthy due to the extreme bias.This guide does a disservice to California and anybody who reads it. Do not buy this book."
3,Not quite sure what age group it was written for,"Animation and characters are geared to little kids but plot motivation is founded on viewer understanding why she seeks to end the world. Until you have lost someone near and dear you want really understand the motivation, if you have then the animation is geared to a younger crowd... A bit like your computer manual coming in crayon as another parallel.Reminds me a lot of when I went to see Marlie and Me with some relatives. The kids did not really have and emotional base to tie the movie to so they thought the ending was corny. Those of us old enough to have put down the family pet once or twice put it on the short list of acceptable movies for a guy to shed a tear in."
1,Not for fans of the Game.,"After watching a few episodes of this I have come to the conclusion that this was made with little detail to the actual story line presented in the game. All of the characters back stories are changed and dulled down. The English dub is pretty bad, they mispronounce half of the names. The actual story of the anime is so far different form the games that if you changed the characters names its would be a different show. Overall the only thing good about this was the animation Production IG is a great animation studio, however this feels like a cheap cash in or a badly thought out marketing campaign to hype the game.So, if you are a fan of the game don't watch this, you will be disappointed. If you have never played the game I suggest putting on the Japanese dub and watching it because Funamation dubs are very hit or miss and this is a miss."
5,The best in Malagasy guitar,"I second everything the previous reviewer said. D'Gary has gone on to become an acclaimed guitarist not only among world music fans, but among guitar afficcionados worldwide. This album showcases his enormous talent as well as the distinctive acoustic guitar tradition of southern Madagascar. Even if you don't consider yourself a ""world music fan,"" upon listening to this album, which does cross over better than his solo efforts in terms of wide-range accessibility in my opinion, you might be surprised to discover that the genre offers a world of creativity and human expression to discover.I think Milamina is a good litmus test for whether the trance-enducing repetition and complex rhythms and harmonies of D'Gary (and Malagasy music more generally) will appeal to your ear. And if they do ... enjoy discovering the rest of it and bon voyage. :)"
2,not bad but could be better,"i got the dimarzio x2n dp705 pickup last month and it was easy to wireup,it sounds good but its not worth $80.00 the sustain could be better.and the dimarzio customer service is not great either."
4,Cuddlekins Jumbo Harbor Seal,Purchased this for my grandson for Christmas. He had a small on and loved it so that we bought this big one. The cost was okay but seemed a little high. He loves it.
1,"Bastante Malo, no es lo que vende con ese t&#65533;tulo","Empezando porque ninguno de los crucigramas que hay en el interior del libro es como el que sugiere la portada, le compr? este libro de regalo a mi padre quien es amante de los crucigramas y fue una gran decepcion. Ademas, tiene muchas preguntas relativas a la cultura e historia de M?xico, asi que los que no somos mejicanos o conocemos de este pais, pues no nos v? a ir muy bien, sobre todo porque no son preguntas gen?ricas sino bien especificas del pais. Sinceramente no lo recomiendo a aquellas personas que saben y son amantes de los crucigramas."
5,BUENÍSIMO!!!,"LLeno de material no sólo deentretenimiento, sino hasta cultural, porque por buscar las palabras para el crucigrama, nos vamos informando y adquiriendo cultura adicional. Lo compré en el Aeropuerto de México, y me duró tanto y me tuvo tan entretenida, que cuando llegamos a Roma, caso catorce horas después, ¡no podía creer cómo se me había pasado el tiempo con este libro ! Tiene de todo y para todos, desde cocina hasta cine y cultura general... Excelente para niños, adultos y personas de la Tercera Edad ! No se lo píerdan !!"
1,Ignore the cover-and the book,"The cover suggests that these are conventional crossword puzzles. Actually, each page has perhaps twenty words in a grid that is 90% black squares. Understandably, it takes a greater knowledge of the language to have many interlocking words, but this is silly.In addition, the words don't seem chosen for any particular purpose in learning Spanish. For example, one clue written in Spanish contains the words Shirley McClaine and _____ La Douce. Great for people who remember the old movie with a French title, but filling in IRMA doesn't seem all that helpful for any likely audience."
2,Spanish Edition should be from Spain,I was very disappointed after many attempts to complete the cross-word puzzles. The Spanish being used is Mexican Spanish. I am Cuban and my ancestors are from Spain. I would not have bought this book had I known it was not authentic Spanish. Perhaps you can send me a cross-word puzzle that would meet my needs.ThanksMayte
2,these are hard puzzles,"I was disappointed in this book because, although the picture on the cover looked more crossword style, the puzzles were all crucigram style. The questions were very hard and several were related to Mexico, which I know little about."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!,"this is a pretty good game. challenging levels, outstanding graphics, good gameplay, semi-easy controlsm, but it sucks for just one tiny reason. . . WHEN YOU GET TO THE LAST LEVEL YOU WILL NOT SEE THE ENDING! THE LAST LEVEL IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST FOR THAT REASON, THAT ONE REASON IS WHY THIS GAME TURNED FROM 4/5 TO 2/5 STARS! i say rent it for fun but DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,this game doesn't fly,"Having been spoiled by the professional play of Battlefield 2, I was not only disappointed with this game, I was shocked. It has the same technology as the origional ""ping pong"" and I couldn't resell it fast enough. Save your money on this one."
3,Not a worthy sequel,"If you've played Ace Combat 4, play it again rather than this follow-up. Game play is ridiculously easy, the only saving grace being that there are a number of missions to pass your time. The flight controls are great, as they were in Ace Combat 4, but the chatter from the wingmen - constantly annoying and repetitive, particularly if you have to repeat a mission. The worst part for me though, is the constant beating of the anti-war drum. Now, that might make sense in a game about hippies picking flowers, but this is a game about war - the purpose of the game is to blow up the enemy, not daydream about more peaceful times. Like I said, just save your money and replay AC4."
5,dlester6909,"I looked for this game in Amazon search. I typed in Ace Combat PS3 in the search line. It came up with many games, including Ace Combat 5. It was made for the PS2. Is the game compatible with my PS3 160GB? I figured it would be so I ordered it. I have the game and have not opened it yet because my friend said that it might not be compatible. Does anyone know if it is? The return policy states that full refund if not opened. If I open it, I will be stuck with it. Let me know so that I can start playing it. Thanks all."
4,Ace Combat rocks,"I like flight simulators but they are hard to find with any console. The Ace Combat series has never let me down. If you want it easy, this game will please you. If you want it hard, this game will please you. You can change the difficulty level. The graphics are good, the story line too. If you like flight simulators I suggest this game for you."
3,SHort but good,"I love the game, but I thought that it went by a little too fast. It neede to be longer."
3,Not bad,"Writing this review after 2 months of playing AC5.Enjoyed Belkan War more than AC5. The only plus is that, u have lot more options in selecting aircraft in Ace Combat 5,except for this it never really tested my skills.Would rate Belkan War 5 stars compared to AceCombat 5."
2,I'd rather have a twinkey.,"This boring waste of money is one of the best games to make you fall asleep. You have to fly for minutes to find a enemy, and then you have to find nine more. While it takes forever to shoot them with your machine guns because you run out of missiles from the first five enemies. If I were you, I would get somthing that's actually fun!"
3,It's a nice game,"I bought this game ""used like new"" it cost ten bucks less than a new one and it worth it. I was shocked about how fast the game was delivered.Pros:New planes, more missions (30 the number 4 has 18), it has a good story about a rookie pilotCons:It is for one player onlyThe menu is a little confused"
5,ace combat 5 review,"i've played this game over and over again on PS2 and now on the PS3 60gb and i still love it as much as when it came out! the storyline is very engaging, there's about 27 campaign missions that will test your flying skills again and again. there are quite a number of planes you can unlock and enjoy. good graphics for its time period of release and for being on PS2."
4,very good game but,This game was fun but at certain times was very annoying.i enjoyed it.i wish the missions weren't weird or unrealistic.at times i was irritated by things in the game that didn't make any sense.
3,Overall very good,"If you like flight sim games, I would recommend the game. I think the story line sucks, but a lotta people don't care about that anyway. I happen to like the story lines behind the scences of the action.Ace 6 is already out and I haven't played it. I don't have the PS3 yet (PS3 is too expensive for the small amount of time I get to play video games). I'm hoping it is better.For the low price, I highly recommend this game. But the shipping is surprisingly expensive still."
2,low prime time,"this is perhaps the weekest output of coleman. the pieces have a short song format and are polished to easy-listening radio style. it?s not that the themes are not good, but it?s not prime time?s best afford. listen to ""dancing in your head"" and ""body meta"", these are excellent, prime time at its?s best!"
5,Th Leipzig Connection,"I ordered more than one, one from each supplier, but up to now I have only received one.The book itself is excellent. Everyone should read it."
5,Very Informative,Lots of information on how the Rockefellers have affected education in this country. They set up foundations to improve public opinion about themselves. Also covers Wundt and others. Recommended reading.
5,Great Jump rope for beginners or adults that havn't jumped since 1st grade,"Before buying this jump rope, I owned a plastic cord type rope that I bought for exercise. I never really used it and when I wanted to it was wrinkled and nearly impossible to use and it snapped when I used it outside in the cold.So I found this type of rope and knew that being made of rope material that It wouldn't snap in the cold. The beads are a bonus! Not being as flexible or nimble as I was in 1st grade, the beads help to keep the shape in a perfect U so you can jump over it and not trip up. So far the beads have not broken. I use this twice a week for cardio exercise before resistance training. If you want to speed jump, this rope is not intended for that purpose. It is possible but not for long. The black and white color is also appealing. Oh and the rope is adjustable if your short like me :)"
4,good starter rope,"This is an excellent starter rope. Good for people just learning to jump rope (maybe for the first time as an adult). Easy to use, good weight makes it easier to keep form."
5,A must read,"When I first became interested in the Romanovs I knew very little about Russian history so the context was difficult for me. Some suggested I read the standard books that are the usual recommendations. Then one of my professors suggested I read The Secret Plot to Save the Tsar so that I could put the events leading up to the final days of the Tsar and his families' lives in Siberia into context. I am so glad I did,For anyone really interested in what was going on in Russia in 1918 this is absolutely a book you will not be able to put down. While McNeal's first book attempts to walk between an exciting read and an academic exercise, I never felt betrayed on either level. It was worth investing my time."
5,Imagination in Music,This is a cd that one can get lost in -- just relax and let the magical sounds of the masterful guitar playing wash over you. A great audio experience. I'm looking forward to additional works by Greg Reiter.
5,Living music,"I am not a long-time fan of flamenco guitar but there is no doubting Greg Reiter's talent and passion for the music he creates.The thing that makes this record such an inspirational listen is the energy that you can feel resonating through the speakers, it's as if the music has a life all of it's own.Even to the untrained ear this is a beautiful album."
5,Beautiful Music,This music reminds me of being home on the island in the Mediterranean Sea. It takes me back to the times we spent sitting in a cafe on the beach while relaxing with great friends and family.
5,An End To My Confusion,"I have solved many mysteries of Depression Era Glass patterns on unmarked pieces through the use of this wonderful, well documented guide. Although this guide presents a small insert of colored pictures the bulk of the pages provide ""drawings"" in black and white which are actually quite helpful in determining the pattern you are matching. In addition, pattern names, manufacturers and years of manufacturing are provided.As a dealer I find the value guides helpful and they are separated by item category, color and value range. The author is honest enough in the introduction to advise you to depend on other references for value accuracy in the ever changing market, particularly with the advent of internet auctions. This book has been extremely helpful as a reference guide and is a welcome addition to my glassware book library."
4,Very informative with lots of photos,This is a well written book.It takes you through from beginners to accomplished turners.Has lots of photos and Interesting projects.
5,Ideal for physical therapy,"I purchased this for physical therapy (plantar fasciitis), use this to stretch the muscles outs. Works well and large enough to assist with balance. Haven't tried the DVD, that was a bonus as I only wanted the disc - saves me a fortune in physical therapy visits!"
4,For the Office!,"Bought this to sit on at work and I LOVE it! I'm a tad finniky with sitting on a ball at work (the dust & dirt on the carpeting- i KNOW it doesn't vaccumed as often as I would like. AND well, the static on my clothes!) so this was a great substitute! Though sometimes it looks like I'm sitting on a hernia disk- but that's OK! Highly recommend it!"
2,GoFit Core Disk Review,"I received my disk and without the DVD, it looked used with spots that would not come off. I cleaned it but they still would not come off. It works as far as my rear end being sore and I may eventually see results on my love handles. I am sorry because of the condition of the disk I will not purchase anything from Amazon again.Marilyn Stevens"
4,Core Disk Review,I use the core disk for my in-home therapy program for my achilles tendon. I had used a similar device when I was in physical therapy. It is a great help to create better range of motion as well as strengthen my calf and ankle. It's sufficiently challenging.
5,Physical Therapy,"I had back surgery in June, started Physical Therapy in September and this was used for many of my core exercises. Amazing how it works and really focuses on the core muscle groups, which need to be strong to support your back. Highly recommend."
3,Training DVD- ha!,"This disk is well made and can help with balance and making exercises more difficult... but the ""training"" DVD it terrible. It shows you basic ideas and positions, but does not offer a whole work out or show. It is a ""here is one exercise"", ""here is another"" that lasts about 15 minutes. The DVD is pretty worthless. But, I really haven't used it much because of that. Same your money and buy a balance ball"
4,Just as described,"Great for what it is - nice to sit on and/or for a simple workout at home. Seems solidly constructed and supports me on one or two feet, with weights."
3,Pretty Good,Works pretty well. I didn't notice a huge improvement in my posture but I do enjoy sitting on it.
4,$17.99 look for the needle,I finally found the needle. It was stuck to the tape holding the cd to the packaging. This is a quality piece of rubber and I didn't find any surprise production errors.
2,Not for Me,"I purchased the GoFit Core Disk after seeing it advertised on TV. I thought it would be good to sit on while working at my desk, but not quite so. It forces me to sit too high in the chair and I now need a pillow for my back. The lumbar support in the chair is gone because of sitting too high - not confortable at all."
5,Wonderful,"As an animator, this movie is great insight into one of my favorite animators, Don Bluth. The extras are a great addition."
5,Must Have Movie,"We have had this movie on vhs since it came out years ago and wanted it for my childrens children on DVD as they have an easier time putting the movie in them selves. We fell in love with this wonderfull movie and have look for years for it on DVD. Thank you so much and I recomend this for all ages to watch. It is a blast, great story, wonderful music and an attention keeper. Better get one quick."
5,Great Book,"I needed to know quickly how to implement a BI solution and ordered three books: Delivering Business Intelligence with Microsoft SQL Server 2005 by Brian Larsen, Applied Microsoft Analysis Services by Teo Lachev, and this book. Of the tree books, this is the only one I really needed. This book had everything I wanted to know about Analysis Services. I was also impressed with the knowledge and information regarding how to design dimensions and cubes especially when it comes to tough situations such as how to apply security. If you need to implement a BI solution, I highly recommend this book."
1,Good Cop / Bad Cop,"Half of the chapters in this book are well planned and very readable. But the other half are just terrible. There are two authors of this book, so it's clear what is behind this. The ""bad"" chapters are loaded with bad grammar, technical errors and explanations that just don't make sense. This would be bad enough, but the larger problem is that there is no overall planning to these chapters, with illogical jumps between topics and a lack of any conceptual flow. I've been reading technical books for over 25 years, and this is without a doubt the poorest offering I've ever seen published. You can gain some value from the book from the ""good"" chapters, but the other chapters are so frustrating that I recommend avoiding this book altogether. If you need to ramp up on 2005 Analysis Services, the Microsoft Press Step-by-Step book is a much better choice."
3,Great book if you can get past the poor grammar,"After reading the previous reviews of this book, I think my expectations may have to been to high. Overall the book is good, but I feel like it could have been more in-depth in numerous areas. I still find myself searching MSDN with help on topics. My main fault with the book was that I constantly had to read sentences over-and-over again due to extremely poor grammer."
5,SQL Server Analysis Services 2005,"The product came as ordered. I would order from this company again. I expected the product in a few weeks, it actually came a few days after I ordered. The book was in great condition."
5,A Landmark Book on Family Businesses!,"Ivan Lansberg's new book is an excellent resource for anyone living through, or helping to manage, the succession process in a family business! The book is thoroughly scholarly yet practical...it is ""a must read,"" for anyone interested in the subject. It is the best book on the subject I have read!"
5,Cool Jams!,"I bought this on a whim and it was the best purchase I have made in years! Some songs are sexy, some relaxing and smooth, others are ultra funky and fun! Some have vocals and some don't. The songs flow into one another. ""Howard's In"" should be in a movie (maybe it was?) with its changing moods - starting with a flowing piano over a strong beat that continues until that funky sax takes its turn, finally ending with the quiet beat blending into the next song. It makes me think of a psychological thriller! Love this!"
5,"I was skeptical, but . . .","My wife has wanted Yesterdays Children for as long as I can remember. I took a chance and ordered this DVD. I was skeptical, because it was advertised that it was in English or Portuguese overdub.Everything worked out find however. I just had to set up the language to English and it was perfect. Received it in a few days too!5 star transaction."
4,A really good book.,"This is the first book I read by Peter Senese: I think CLONING CHRIST brought out some very strong issues to think about while keeping me turning the pages. I am particularly challanged with Max's discovery of possible remnants appearing to be human which might in fact be those of Jesus. It is this discovery Senese brings out the greatest question in his novel: if the remnants left on the cross are those of Jesus, what does this mean? Didn't Christ ascend? And what does this mean not only for Christianity, but for society's everywhere? A lot to take in."
5,A Wonderful Christian Read with a Disclaimer,"Very few books of current fiction present the struggles of faith Man is confronted with during periods of his life the way Peter Senese's novel Cloning Christ does. The story created is intense, thoughtful and most provoking, yet, and in addition, the author carefully takes a righteous position with respect to Christian beliefs. In this story is a cliff-hanger, there are several intense violent scenes, which I would like to point out. I personally can accept the 'truth' in violence and vulgarity if the intention of the presenter is to depict evil for what it is. Senese does just this. I highly recommend Cloning Christ for its honesty, its strong Christian values presented, and for being a historical, educational thriller."
5,What's next?,"Simply put: Cloning Christ explodes off of the pages! I felt as if I was on a high-wire, and one little mistake on my part would bring me over the edge -- so in tune were the writers in making me feel as if I was Max Train. What's next? Keep writing!Jason HolbrookSan Diego"
1,a deceptive book,"This book claims to be one thing, but is actually another. It tricks you into buying it by appealing to America's growing interest with Christianity and faith (witness the success of ""The Passion"" and ""The DaVinci Code""), but it doesn't deliver the goods. Reading the book, it makes promise after promise to discuss great things like science and belief, but it continually puts off these important conversations in favor of badly done, cliche-ridden action scenes. Without spoiling the climax of the so-called plot, it's safe to say that the book's ending makes it clear that the reason the book makes all these promises and then conveniently abandons them without fulfilling them is that Mr. Senese and Mr. Geis lack the literary ability to do so."
5,"For a thriller, this was one inspirational book.","Cloning Christ is an action packed novel that brings to the forefront of the readers mind many topical and traditional issues around personal faith, and introspective acceptance of how far science could or should not go. Boundaries through the authors' questioning of ethics and rights, which are distinctively made clear as seperate, bring together and apart the deeply thought out characters, while allowing the reader to question the very same issues the characters deal with in this tense, riveting spell-binder. On a personal note, I think I have been through my own personal hell, and have bounced back through my faith in God. Cloning Christ is a terrific book."
1,Coulda Been Great!,What could have been an exciting read is weighed down by superfluous description... after description... after description. I found myself wanting to edit the book - I couldn't focus on the storyline anyway! I'm glad I got this from the library and didn't waste money on it!
4,A gifted storyteller.,"Dr. Max Train, ascetic and alone for over a decade, discovers in Jerusalem a cross that appears to be the true cross Jesus died on. In denial that God exists, Train attempts to resolve the bitterness he has carried ever since his wife and daughter were murdered upon realizing the possabilities of his new-found discovery. The passionate scene Senese creates is brilliant -- a conversation I am sure many individuals may have had. However, for Max, there is little time for him to rectify his own personal issues of faith since there are others, including an out of touch Cardinal in Rome who desire him dead!Page after page, this novel spins a deeper tale of intrigue and turmoil, as each carefully created character represents ideological beliefs we have come to hold. The story of Cloning Christ is fast moving and cleverly crafted."
3,Okay.,"THREE/HALF STARSAs a thriller, this is a very good story. The story races across some very fascinating places in Europe, and some of the characters are identifialbe and enjoyable to get to know. Spiritually, I am not too sure the book does it for me. I had a hard time accepting the cross of Jesus could actually be found. For fiction to be enjoyable, there needs to be credability in the plot line or premise. One of the more positive aspects of the story is how I was able to identify with the struggles Train faces. We are all tested, and Senese does an exceptional job in writing into the id of the soul."
1,Simple Grammer Needed,"Rarely have I been so irritated by a book. Did they not employ spell check or a copy editor? Beyond the glaring grammatical errors, the title should have been ""They Think I'm Going To Clone Christ, But I'm Not, Really!"" This book could have been an inspired work raising many theological and moral questions but ended up third rate blood and guts."
2,love this perfume,"I love this perfume, but it is not as expected and disappointed. My bottle leaks also, These is not pleasant and comfortable. Smell disappears as soon. Finally, I was disappointed."
5,Saved by the Bell - Seasons 3 & 4,"Saved by the Bell - Seasons 3 & 4 is very awesome and fun,it's a 4-Disc set which contains Seasons 3 and 4 together in one boxed set DVD.There are 29 episodes in one boxed set DVD,the episodes are The Famous Belding Boys,The Last Dance,Breaking Up is Hard to Undo,Zack's Birthday Party,The Glee Club,The Aftermath,The Game,Wicked Stepbrother (Part 1),Wicked Stepbrother (Part 2,The Last Weekend,Pipe Dreams and All in The Mall.This is a very fun show to watch and it's great for anytime viewing,this is a good show for all ages to enjoy."
4,This doesn't contain all the episodes in Season 4.,This doesn't have all the episodes in Season 4. In fact there are 7 episodes or more that are not on this set. I think they should've put in all the episodes. They should rerelease this with all the episodes.
3,"Not what I thought, but still great!!","Ok, well I assumed Seasons 3 & 4 went all the way through the end of Senior Year... apparently, I was wrong. This is basically Junior Year. While I still enjoy owning Saved by the Bell on DVD, I was looking forward to owning all of the high school years (I have Seasons 1 & 2 on DVD as well). I hope Lion's Gate chooses to release the rest of this timeless series. I definitely recommend this DVD set, but just know that it is not the gang's 3rd and 4th year of high school, it is the 3rd and 4th Season (I didn't know there was a difference, but there is)."
3,set is disappointing,"I love this show and I was looking foward to seeing seasons three and four but this set only contains season three not season four.If you look up the episode guide on http://www.tvtome.com/.Your find that there is 52 episodes in seasons three and four, and this set contains only 29 episodes 26 of them are from season three and three of them are from season two.My point is that for those of you who where looking foward to completing your save by the bell collection with this set it s not going to happen.Not entill lions gate entertainment releses what they call season 5 which is realy season 4.Anyway this set is ok but I was hopeing for all of season 3 and 4,after all that is what the box said."
4,This Is what Seasons 3 and 4 are,"I have just bought the dvd and I have discovered what they are finally doing. First off everyone has to go the website that has the right episode guide so u can mark down how to follow the episodes the right way. You thought season 1 and 2 were bad, seasons 3 and 4 episodes are all over the place. The first 3 episodes on the dvd are continued episodes from season 2.. The belding boys, Breaking up is hard to undo and the glee club. the video, and snow white episodes still dont appear even though they are from season 2 which is 10th grade. Basically the dvd is Season 3 which can be considered 11th grade in its entirety. And the extra season in there is the malibu sand episodes.. I figure somtime in the next few months they will release Seasons 5 and 6 which will probably be Grade 12 and the Tori episodes.. That seems to be the plan now that i see how they are setting this up."
3,WHERE IS SEASON 4?,"This dvd was good, but could have been better. Like everybody else, Where is the Tori eposodes? Where is the episode where Zack kisses lisa? Or the one Where they do the rapping snow white episode? or the Graduation episode?. There also could have been alot more on what the cast where doing now on the specal features, and a booklet would have been nice. All in all i rate this a 3 because i was looking for all of season 4. I hope they come out with season 5 and 6 on dvd soon, and all the Save by the bell movies on dvd to."
3,bitter sweet,"I am very glad that this was finally released. However the releasing of it was done very sloppily. The shows are not in order and the actual show was only on for 4 seasons. Whomever was in charge of it should have had the shows in order and why did you release it as 5 seasons? I did buy my copy on ebay and I am very happy with my purchase, as I am sure anyone who has seen the show will be."
1,Season Incomplete BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! The DVD's and box materials are cheap and the seasons are incomplete. The box is labeled Seasons 3 & 4 but it sould be labeled ""Only a Few Episodes of Seasons 3 & 4"". The season 4 is just 1 DVD!! I gave 1 star just because of Amazon's good service."
3,Wheres the Rest of It?????,Although it is great to have this show out on DVD I still feel a little bit cheated..... I grew up watching this show and I am pissed to find out that alot of my favorite episodes arent on the DVDs... What happened... Why does it jump around so much..... If anyone can give me any feedback on this Id appreciae it.... email me at EMAN2059@aol.com..... I still love this show but I feel a little cheated... I want all the episodes.... not just some...
3,Saved By the... Where's Season 4?,"I love season three, i watched every episode, but where is season four? I looked up the episode guide, and these episodes only cover season three. I think its a rip off, they lie. I want my money back."
5,Stunning orchestrial beauty: Neil hasn't lost his touch!,"Generation Sex sets the tone for the album - one of stunning melodic beauty with bleak dark undertones.Sweden is, I feel, a minor blemish. Its a blemish quickly forgotten, though, as the strings of Eric the Gardener sweep over... and then the trumpets proclaim the the arrival of one the tracks of the year; National Express (its a coach company for all you dear american friends). With the line ""Its hard to get by when your arse is the size of a small country"" empirically proven by the numerous times I've had a lady with an arse the size of Belgium barge past.Then on, via some more sweetly delivered warnings of impending doom to a memory of past conflict. The album ends with this uplifting theme (sunrise); an autobiographical track about Neil's Northern Irish upbringing.This album shows that Neil can write without hiding behind a sartorial sceptcal screen and is much the better for it."
5,wow.,"""Eric the Gardener"" is one of the most beautiful songs ever penned. I adore this album...""Generation Sex"" is also a fantastic, wry commentary on modern society. For an intelligent, fun, entirely listenable album of finely-crafted music and swoonable singing, get this album immediately. It's absolutely perfect."
5,Classic,"This is the first Divine Comedy album I bought and I was SO impressed,it is one of my most fave albums ever. I highly recommend it."
3,Epoca de oro,"Todas las personas que lean esto les puedo decir sin ninguna dudaque Migue Aceves Mejia fue lo mejor de Mexico para cantar Rancheras como la malaguena,El pastor y otras ,sigue siendo y sera el mejor para los Falsetes"
4,Toys are US~!,Perfect for the novice to the collector. Alot of rich history and terminology of soft toys and collector toys.But that is what this is a Pure Dictionary!
1,Useless Support and Warranty,"I am also having rediculous support problems with Keys. I bought an Ironman Triad treadmill which is very similar to the 150t (previous model I believe). It worked great for a year, then the belt started slipping. That took a month to fix. A day later, the motor died. The motor has a 10 year warranty, so they said they would replace it. When a new on didn't arrive as promised I called back to find out it was backordered for three weeks. I waited and still no motor. I am now told it is backordered for two months. This is just pathetic. I've gotten plenty of sympathy from the support people, but my treadmill has been briken for three months now, and will maybe get repaired in another three. If I'm 'lucky'. Even though I thought the unit was great when it worked, I would avoid Ironman and Keys equipment at all costs. It's not going to last and they won't honor the warranty."
4,Still going...,"This treadmill beeps rather loudly whenever you adjust the speed or incline, but maybe this is something you can turn off and I just haven't bothered to figure out how. It does fold up, but is heavy and difficult to lock in place. We generally just leave ours open.In the end, I think the most important thing is durability. We've been using ours regularly (several times a week) for nearly two years and it still works as well as ever."
2,Product smells old.,I am an Opium fan and have a little of this product in another bottle- they smell VERY differently. I think that perhaps this one's shelf life is almost over. Would not purchase from this vendor again.
3,Could Have Been Better,"Well, I read Eureka Productions'Graphic Classics: Edgar Allan Poe (Graphic Classics (Graphic Novels)), and I have to admit it - I was consequently a little disappointed in this sequel volume. While the stories in this volume were uniformly interesting (more or less), I didn't feel the artwork was up to same level as the Poe volume. (A notable exception: Michael Manning's excellent adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Thing On The Doorstep"". I'll definitely keep an eye out for his (Manning's) work in the future.) Probably worth a look if you're a fan of any of the original writers, but I wouldn't go out of my way to read this one unless you're a complete horror comics nut."
2,black and white,not a very good comic. All in black and white and not much diolog. might as well read the book.
1,The Rockefeller Diet?,"The Rockefeller Diet? Is this a joke? Perhaps those barium salts and aluminium (ooops, oh no, I misspelled it!) fibers falling from the sky as ""clouds"" or ""chemtrails"" could be a true Rockefeller Diet? The only difference, the true ""Rockefeller Diet"" is to Die For (and from)."
5,"Expensive per-shot, but worth it","The cost of this film breaks down to $1 a shot, so be ready to take quality shots every time. Using this film with a Polaroid Land Camera 440 (no flash, indoor lighting) and it works beautifully.Chemicals get a bit messy if you're not careful, but that's more a user issue than a product issue."
5,How easy can it get?,"Wow! I just tried my new Mavis Beacon typing program after my daughter became an excellent typist using same. What is there to say? Do I like the command step-by-step for using my fingers on the key board, the color reminders for mistakes, the instant feedback of my words per minute (in spite of the automatic assurances that I am already a great typist), the awesome jazz that backgrounds and distracts from an otherwise possibly tedious typing lesson? YES to all of the above!Everybody who wants an easy and fun way to learn to type (and believe me - I've already tried some of the so-called fun typing programs) good old fashioned Mavis is still the best in the game!"
4,You get what you ask for,"Excellent compillation for a sports collector, nice image quality and original commentator. Special features, best goals summary. Could be excellente if it had the tournament trophy ceremony."
4,All of the goals from an entertaining Euro 2008,"All the Goals of UEFA Euro 2008A very entertaining encapsulation of all the goals scored during the past summer's Euro 2008 championship won by long-suffering Spain. Relive the amazing goals scored by the vaunted Spaniard short-passing attack, the flair of the Dutch and the Teutonic precision of the Germans and the artistry of the Portuguese. Definitely worth a look see."
3,More Info Please,"Spoiler alert: Not a real review, just reviewing reviewers & Amazon product details. Neither Amazon nor any reviewers have yet given details on members of the Ellington orchestra present at this recording session. Disappointing, given the comments about the extensive liner notes included in this release.Perhaps it's the 'backing-band' ensemble playing on the previews (maybe that's the way the entire recording is). Who knows? I haven't heard it all yet.Sounds like I hear Johnny Hodges. And I know Ben Webster recorded on Sinatra's 'Reprise' label. Tell us who's there, Amazon or anyone.The previews do sound tight, like Sinatra's best backing-band ever for slow tunes. Hope there's an instrumental solo or two somewhere.More info please..."
4,Serene Bluesy & Still Swings At Right Places,"A curious matching, 2 masters of their craft.Sinatra in late 1967 and the Duke and his men at the later stages.If Sinatra had a cold(so they say) the singing is still good and Ellington and the band play in their grand regal fashion. Not an upbeat CD but spirited with a laid back demeanor that works in a moody way.Not exactly a ""soul Call"" but pretty good considering the juxtaposition of these 2 giants.Sinatra worked better with Basie which can be expected.The material selected is generally emotional and suits them well. I get a kick out of ""Sunny"" and their rendition of Duke's ""I Like The Sunrise"".The CD clocks in short but is an attractive package with notes and part of the Sinatra repackages.Recommended for collectors of these collaborations."
3,Not the best or the worst,"Sinatra with the Duke,what could be better? Unfortunately that is'nt the case for either of these legends.On this recording Sinatra's voice sounds worn and strained and the Duke's band does'nt sound together in places.However there are spots of greateness amongst the mostly dreary arrangements.""Poor Butterfly"" is about the best of the lot.""I Like the Sunrise"" ,a poor tune that Duke penned for Al Hibbler from his 1940's Liberian Suite is amongst the worst.What might Sinatra have done with Ellington gems like ""I Got it Bad ect.-Do Nothing 'till You Hear From Me-It Dont Mean A Thing If It Aint Got That Swing"" and so on.What a waste of time and talent.I bought this album on 33 1/3 RPM disc in 1968 and was disapointed then.Save your money and get something else from either of these two giants.A good start,if you dont already have it, is Sinatra with Basie from the same period.A superb record."
2,Not a self-help book,"Despite its casual style this book is more of an academic essay than a spiritual aid. That may well be the author's intention but the subtitle ""Discovering Your Place In God's Strategic Plan"" is missleading because the book didn't help me to feel more a part of God's plan at all. In fact, it made me feel inadequate because I didn't understand much of what the author was going on about and it didn't stir any passion in me. It is a difficult book to read and I would not describe it as accessible. After starting it three times I finally got through it on the third attempt but my perseverance was not rewarded. Even at the end under the heading ""Make the Story Your Own"" it was just more of the same, quotations and jumping around with this idea and that, and nothing that I could grasp onto, let alone ""make my own"". I didn't get the feeling that the story really concerned me at all."
5,great condition,"I haven't got around to reading it just yet, but the copy I bought arrived in excellent condition."
3,Surf Gecko,"I got this book for my son who loves Moki the Gecko, but he read it and said it was mostly about keeping beaches clean, and not so much about Moki. He was disappointed in the book, but said he wanted to keep the book anyway, just to complete his collection of Moki books. Had I read the book before ordering, I probably wouldn't of bought it. Granted we should keep the earth clean, but everywhere you go, they shove it in your face. Let kids enjoy a book without being hounded on keeping something clean!"
4,Finney's Memoirs,Finney's biography can be most appreciated if one has first digested Finney's Systematic Theology. Apart from that framework the reader may not grasp the significance of many of his personal struggles. Finney was a Revivalist and staunchly anti-Calvinistic (anti-determinist).
4,Good for ESL students,"I read this book to prepare for my English 1C class.I should mention that I never had read any english books completely in my life because usually every sentence in the book had some difficult words that I need to open my dictionary to see the meaning.While doing that, I forgot what I read before and lost interest.This one isn't like those books.Author seemed to choose words for ESL students. Every words were easy and had direct meaning.This was the first english novel that made me read overnight.If you aren't good in English, but want to start on English literature, read this one."
3,Strange,"This is a weird book, more of a parable than a novel. Yet its display of psychological types and crowd behavior is fascinating, funny, and at times unsettling. Especially when dealing with the cycles of hero worship, from adoration to disillusion, when things get ugly."
4,Mills has one foot in the metaphysical,"The first two Mills novels, Restraint of Beasts and All Quite on the Orient Express, had both feet firmly planted in the earth. This new effort, fifty pages shorter than the others, is less earthy, more abstract. Mills is audacious enough to retell the story of Adam and Eve, Man's quest of knowledge, his need for faith and conformity in a story about people who want to live in tin houses who feel threatened by a man who would ""branch out"" to houses made of clay. The narrator, a definite ""tin man,"" represents the impulse to retreat into the cozy womb of nonrisk and stagnant consciousness while a strange messiah figure, Michael Hawkins, represents the impulse to venture into unchartered territory. The novel has the same droll sensibility of the other novels and is packed with philosophical ideas, yet I must confess I love the first two novels more, as Mills has plenty of thematic richness when he keeps both feet planted in the soil."
4,Dead-pan and loving it,"Like Mills' other novels, it's better to not `over-analyse' what's going on and just go with the flow.An unnamed narrator lives in a house made of tin, in the middle of nowhere. A woman he barely remembers arrives at his house and moves in. She attracts the attention of the narrator's three neighbors, who all live miles away in their own tin house. These three guys start to `bond', but the narrator decides to remain outside their group. The three neighbours bring news of another man living further out who wants to `rock the boat' with houses made of clay. The narrator, a loyal `tin man', feels threatened.I love Mill's writing style; he doesn't complicate his language by describing everything in emaculate detail but let's you use your imagination. His dry, dark, deap-pan writing is brilliant but not for everyone."
4,"A parable about many things, best seen as metaphor","At first, this book seems to be about a a man who lives alone in a tin house far removed from civilization. Then a woman suddenly appears and moves in. Why she appears and what compells her to arrive, move in and take up with this man isn't obvious.It helps to suspend any sense of reality when reading this one since the author makes no attempt to explain how this man and woman keep their food supplies stocked, how they spend most of their time etc. Even so, I found this to be an original and engaging book about the ""battle of the sexes"" even in the most minimum, sparest of circumstances.Also, when I stopped trying to make ""sense"" of the situation described here, I realized that this book isn't about the real world as much as how men and women see things differently and how even a simple tin house in the middle of nowhere can become problematical for them. Different from the author's first two books, but a worthy successor all the time."
4,Metaphysical Fable Not as Earthy as Past Efforts,"Three to See the King is a fable, an ambitious one at that, about two races of people, those who prefer the comfort of their tin houses, and those more daring, ambitious creatures who would like to venture out of their tin houses and make abodes made of clay. This conflict is Mills' way of retelling the book of Genesis; it's all here, the conflict between Adam and Even, the need for faith, the search for God, the treacly conformity of ""true believers."" I enjoyed this short novel, but prefer Restraint of Beasts and All Quiet on the Orient Express, two novels with both feet deep in the soil."
2,Not Fresh Enough,"One man lives alone in a house of tin, on an empty plain. Along comes a woman and a stranger, and what follows is a parable with heavy religious undertones. The Christ-like figure seemed overly obvious, as did the other symbols throughout. The story is interesting enough, but none of the characters was given sufficient time to develop. When finished, I felt I had just read a story I'd already read a dozen times before, only this version lacked the fresh insight one would expect from a retelling of an ages-old story.For Mills's best, try RESTRAINT OF BEASTS instead."
1,don't believe the hype,"The previous reviewers of this ""work"" are either embarrassed to admit they don't get it, or lackeys for the publisher. This is a yawn from start to finish, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Stuff your fable analysis in the toilet- my two year old son's books have far more meaning than this fraud. Its only saving grace is its length, but I'm still bitter about those two hours. The whole thing reminds me of Being There, and methinks the author just may be the reincarnation of Chauncey Gardner (sp??). Bah humbug..."
5,Across the Seasons,"Across the Seasons is much more than a romantic story written about lovers across time. It is a well documented story of the men who opened up the western mountain regions to future settlers. The descriptions of the scenery are breath-taking and the scenes of violent encounters are believable and spine chilling. It has something for every reader, the romantic, the adventurer as well as the arm-chair traveler."
5,Interesting Tales,"This well-written book provdes some amusing insights in female-female relationships, which most women would prefer to deny. Fillion's use anecdote to illustrate a series of broad points is funny and entertaining. A very enjoyable (and cringe inducing) read."
1,Unreadable,"I found this book to be unreadable. Each chapter begins with a detailed story about a girl and her friend, which goes on for pages and pages before the author gets to any real conclusions or arguments. Yet, the actual observations and analyses the author makes are not right, I believe, and her arguments are unconvincing.The coup de grace is the Conclusion, which has no summary or concluding remarks, but instead goes into a discussion of how young girls are treated by society today, i.e. birth control, saying no, teen pregnancy, etc."
4,Practical and teacher-friendly,"This book takes the jargon and boring academic ""intelligencia"" out of informing teachers how to work with Gifted and Talented children. The author doesn't make us feel stupid. Instead we are treated as partners in building a challenging, yet safe world for our G and T students. FABULOUS!"
5,Completely Practical and Understanding,"This book will not give a religious view of salvation, but a true biblical view of what salvation IS and what it is NOT. This book will prove to you that once you ""get saved"", you are not necessarily always going to be saved--it all depends on your views of sin. Do you have a worldly view of sin, or do you see sin as God does? This book will set you straight. As you read it, you may think it strict! Yeah, but Glory to God in the Highest, this book may very well be a catalyst in changing your mind on some things and in the end, saving your soul and your spirit from death! An awesome book from an awesome evangelist. All of his works should be read by those who have a serious desire to know what religion has been falsely preaching. I praise God for giving Charles Finney such a profound view of Christianity and the Body of Christ. If you think you have a calling on your life, please do yourself a great big favor and read this book! You will be very glad you did!!!"
4,the fireball,"One of the better movies with Mickey. It was the movie I learned to ""hate"" Mickey. When an actor can make you either Love or hate a character,they are better, then just good actors.I am of the era, where I grew up with Mickey Rooney.From the Hardy Boys, to Black Beauty,(? or was it My Friend Flicka? (?)) to The FireBall,to his classic war movies.Starred with Judy,and Elizabeth.Married to some of the glamorous ladies in Hollywood.This""little big Man"" did it all."
2,"Great book, but the Kindle version is horrible","I have the 2nd edition in both book and Kindle form. I give the book form 5 stars; the Kindle version is horrible. You won't see this from the sample, but the index is completely useless - its simply a list of words with no hyperlinks. Additionally, none of the citations are present in the Kindle version, rendering it worthless for any serious study or using outlines. One wonders whether anyone at the publisher, Basic Books, bothered to read the Kindle version before releasing it.Again, the book itself gets 5 stars, the Kindle version needs a lot of work before it's worth the money."
5,Same version I used in College,Ah... those lectures were invaluable. Pick up a copy and do some thinking!!!
5,A clear translation...,Allan Bloom's traslation of Plato's Republic is a fine one; it makes for clear reading and includes an interesting interpretive essay along with a wealth of endnotes that help for future research on the subject. Plato's Republic is a must-read; if one is interested in reading through it I would recommend Bloom's translation.
1,"NEED citations on the side. Also, page number wouldn't hurt.","While the book is phenomonal, the kindle version really needs citations on the side like the regular book would have.I bought this for my SOSC class at uchicago for economical reasons, and I'm regretting it now. I can't possibly cite this book with percentage signs and ""location"" numbers (whatever those mean, anyway) on my papers. :|Don't be cheap; just buy the actual book. Learn from my mistakes."
5,Best Translation of The Republic,"Allan Bloom as a Straussian philosopher tries to detach his translation from the Christian tendencies of his time. He permits the translation to speak for itself and prides himself on such a literal translation. Despite the literalness of the text, the reading is still easy regardless if you are an academic or a layperson. As a student and owner of the Hackett Complete WorksPlato Complete Worksavoid the Grube translation and embrace the literal translation of Bloom. He maintains the much needed detail of the politeia that Grube cuts out.Bloom's translation comes with a very solid in depth introduction, superb endnotes and a rich interpretive essay. My only issue with his essay is his quick discussion of the divided line leaves more footwork for the reader but isn't that how it should be?"
1,Allan Bloom - Just wither and die already.,"As usual, the atrophied intellect that is Allan Bloom successfully attempts to rape a classic piece of philosophy with his mediocre, lackluster, ogrish brutality, which is his norm, towards true academia, knowledge and wisdom. If Rush Limbaugh re-wrote the Constitution you'd get an idea of the ruse that masks itself analogous to Mr. Bloom's feebility towards writing and thought contained within this boorish tome.If you just want to read the Republic as it was intended, to the best of our Anglo-Franco-Germanic understanding of the last two centuries, steer far clear of Mr. Bloom's literary abortion within these pages.If you further care of preserving your ability to reason, unfiltered and unprejudicially, I suggest looking into Mr. Bloom's history and agenda towards the upheaval of education, truth and attitude(s) toward integrity and intellectually honest liberty before considering wasting your hard earned currency on his insidiously dishonest dribble."
4,Very happy with product,"I got this fountain for my birthday this year and i love it. It was very easy to assemble and has a nice sound to it when it is running. I like the soft candle like glow and the stones are nice as well. If you look too closley it does look a little cheap, but i cannot find a flaw with how it works. Overall i highly recommend it"
1,"Save your money, this is a loser!","I received my fountain in the mail yesterday, and I am very disappointed in it.It is made of very cheap plastic, and when I got it set up and turned on, the motor ran (very loudly) and the lights turned on, but it would not pump the water at all...so no waterfall. I'm sending it back, and I would not recommend this fountain to anyone."
2,So pretty but doesn't last long,"I've owned 2 of these, my second one just bit the dust again. These are now discontinued and it is probably a good thing since they just don't last long.This was actually a lovely fountain when it worked. It truly mimicked soft candle light, flickered, looked gorgeous, and the fountain aspect was very relaxing and soothing. One of my favorite home decorations, but without fail the LED lights always go out. My first one I attempted to find replacement parts but none are offered so I bought another one I actually liked it that much. Now the second one, the LED lights have died once again. Without the lights the fountain is rather pointless. Such a disappointment!"
2,Great At First,"This was very beautiful and soothing at first, but over a few months this fountain slowly started to deteriorate, becoming noisier, and the light stopped working....I wouldn't buy another one. I felt the product should hold up much better and last longer."
1,Looks good but HoMedics quality is awful,"I had one of this model for 2 or 3 years. I finally replaced it because the lights went out completely. I don't blame HoMedics for that. We have very, very hard water and I have to periodically clean the fountain with vinegar to dissolve the lime. I had other HoMedics fountains for years before that, and they always worked for a long time.I tried replacing this one with a different model, the garden leaves, but I had to return 2 of that model when the lights went out in less than 2 weeks. I then paid the extra money and got another fountain of this model.This one worked for 34 days - 4 days after Amazon's return deadline - and the pump died. Amazon was great and still gave me a refund, but I've had it with HoMedics. 3 HoMedics fountains ordered in the less than 3 months and all of them now returned. I'll never buy a HoMedics fountain again. They must have laid off their quality control department. I'm trying another brand."
4,Lovely,"I bought one of these lovely fountains a couple of years ago. I really loved it. The candles are plastic (and so is the base), but they had a beautiful warm glow and the water was nice to listen to at night. It lasted about a year before it went out. I would give it 5 stars, but it should really last longer for the price."
2,Motor Noise Fountain,"Looks nice, but the loud noise from the fountain motor makes this unusable as intended - for relaxing water sounds. Would not recommend."
3,Don't expect the lights to last.,"I bought two of these fountains, and the lights stopped working after three months on the first one, the lights on the second one lasted slightly longer. The fountain itself still works on both, and for the price it wasn't that much of a loss. But it was disappointing. If the sound is more important than the looks, this is a decent, affordable fountain."
2,"Looks nice, sounds terrible","I received this fountain as a gift. Visually, it's actually quite appealing. Unfortunatly, the sound of the pump is impossibly loud. I checked to be sure that the water was at the proper level and the pump itself correctly affixed to the bottom. Regardless, the pleasing trickle of water from the candle spouts was overwhelmed by the churning machine below. Can't recommend it."
1,NOT worth it in the long run,"I bought this fountain last year. And altho I loved it at first, it wasn't long before it stopped working. First the lights go out, then the pump starts acting up and barely spitting water out. Keep in mind, I cleaned the fountain once a week, including making sure the pump wasn't covered over with that icky film it'll get from the water.I've purchased several different HoMedics fountains in the past. I've come to realize that none of them hold up - especially if it runs 24/7 (but hey, isn't that the point of buying an indoor fountain in the first place?) If you want a fountain, I strongly suggest paying more money for the better brands. Because in the long run, you'll end up throwing your money away time and time again to replace these cheap Homedics fountains."
5,Our cats love them,We've used these fountains for years. Our cats love running water and this drink out of this fountain and play in the water. We've had several over the years. I turn them off at night and attempt to keep them clean (they aren't easy to clean) and have had good luck with them.Guiests are always amazed to see the cats drink from the burning candle.
2,Focuses too much on character recognition,"If you are doing work in character recognition, I think you will find something useful here. Otherwise, skip this book and read Theodoridis's ""Pattern Recognition"". You will find a wealth of practical and theoretical information from all walks of pattern recognition in his book.In short, Nadler's book seems overly specialized, superficial, and dated."
5,ENDGAME,Everyone should watch this - it is a must.Very informative. Information that mainstreammedia will not provide.
4,Bilderberg = Destruction for Greed,"We all know the world is mad! We teach our children to be honest, work hard, get a good education and be kind to self and others. This is not what the powers that rule the world do or feel. They are an elite group of kooks that are so power hungry and greedy that their morals are non existant. This is what each person that has respect for life needs to know regardless of your back round or circumstances. To know the truth is power. Power to fight these inter bred elites! We have the numbers and can only fight the plans they have for humanity by knowing what the plan is. This is a good source of information to learn from. Be aware and you can make a difference. I highly suggest any one who questions the decisions of power today see this movie!"
5,WAKE UP AMERICA!!,"This is a must see; the documentary shows that are country has been bought out! From the two parties that run against each other, to the news that is being bent/made up on behalf of coperate greed. Things are not as they seem."
1,More of Alex Jones' baseless scare tactics.,"Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is back at work, and his latest ""documentary"" is a doozy. I put the word ""documentary"" in quotation marks because I can't even really say that this qualifies as a documentary. Jones does a nice job putting the show together, but he fails to ever produce even one shread of evidence that could be called concrete or factual. He shouts claims of conspiracies involving the ""elite,"" but fails to identify who they are, or elaborate on how they plan on wiping out over 80% of the world's population? Jones provides experts with credentials that are sketchy, at best, if not down right ludacris. And that is assuming that he even names his experts. This movie would make a good plot for a Sy-Fy Channel original feature, but otherwise, it's laughable."
3,Seller shipping practice,The only complaint I have is that the seller listed this same video on two different lines. He listed it as having only one video on each line so you have to pay shipping on each one. I don't understand why he couldn't ship them together saving the buyer some money.
2,Interesting tidbits with lots of unproven/conspiratorial conjecture,"A hodgepodge of not great video, so visually not very engaging. Seems like more fear-mongering than fact. While some theories presented may have some bearing in reality (eg those in power wish to stay in power - which is not breaking any new ground), it promotes paranoia essentially. I guess it is maybe worth watching to better understand the range of views held out in society, but I don't feel it provides much enlightenment. If you like conspiracy theories, I guess it's probably for you. If you are more interested in a sober evaluation of truth and steps to fight the powers that be, you probably should look elsewhere."
3,Conspiracy theory without the hype,"Very interesting DVD. Mostly familiar information for readers / viewers of this type of information. Nevertheless, new footage makes the DVD worth a look. Despite being aware of these issues, I still found the information disturbing. The sheer audacity and gargantuan scale of the plan for global control is jaw dropping."
1,Wasted Opportunity,"Thoroughly interesting subject matter - unfortunately handled by a base-level idiot. A significant lack of substance, some lame Michael Moore-style megaphone antics and a bunch of low rent, low heel nobodies as spokesmen didn't help add gravitas to this heavily flawed attempt at documentary. In fact 'our hero' ends up making a completely backwards step for his cause. On the plus side, he did make me realise there is a senior living Rockefeller (David) still walking the earth and adding to the generally loathsome family legacy - other than that, it was a huge waste of an evening."
5,Bravo Alex!,"Highly recommend this film! As horrific the subject matter may be, it's all well documented and presented in a very strait forward surprisingly palatable format. Alex Jones has boldly gone where no one has gone before and he's taken the audience with him, strait down the rabbit hole. Just get it and watch it for your self. Do it for your children's future!"
5,Alex cured my Apathy!,"When it comes to informative documentaries about our nations future, this movie puts all the facts that are hidden by the media and the globalist and lays it right in front of your eyes and ears. People will tell you, there is no such thing as the Bilderberg Group and there is no ""North American Union"", until....they watch this movie and find out what has been hidden until now. I used to think people were crazy when they spoke about things that were not said on my TV. Alex Jones' TerrorStorm cured my Apathy.Terrorstorm: 2nd Edition"
5,We Must Know Our Past,We must know our past if we are going to understand what can happen to us in the future. This video is a must see for every American.
4,And The Truth Shall Set You Free!,"Information/proof of The Neo Con agenda and a ton of it! Four stars only cause it seems to go a little long.But everyone needs to know this stuff! Buy 10 of these and keep them in your car trunk or your brief case, or your back pack, or your whatever that you keep at hand and give them out! A small price to pay against what the Neo Cons have invested against you!Too bad everybody has become so desensitised to the truth, that they don't know it when they see it, or they simply are so dumbed down, they don't even care enough to know better, i.e. that they should care and be paying attention!Eternal Vigalance is the price of Freedom!However, understand, though ""The Love of Money,"" may be the root of all evil, its not about money!ITS ABOUT POWER AND CONTROL!"
4,Wish it was longer,"I learned alot from this movie, I only wish it was longer. I really liked the history of eugenics parts and how it ties in with the globalist's agenda. I was also fascinated by the connection of depopulation with global warming and the ""mother earth"" religion. I was happy to see the mention of the Georgia Gladstones at the beginning of the film because many people are unaware of their existence, secrecy, and significance. This movie is not to be missed and needs a sequel. Perhaps the sequel could expand on the pagan/occult beliefs of the global elites."
2,A little too preachy...,"We were excited to watch Endgame; we put it in the player almost immediately after receiving it in the mail. It seemed OK to start, but then began unwinding as we watched it... Alex Jones, although entertaining at first, gets a little too preachy for our blood. Hoping to see a thorough indictment, it ended up being a rather limp clump of more circumstantial evidence than anything else...It was good in part, but disappointing overall."
2,???,"I understand that powerful leaders are trying to shape world policy, but I think this document is giving to much power to one group. When things really unfold even they will be surprised. They may not be the major players."
2,Meh,"Nope. Lot's of accusations, conspiracy theories, and the like with little to no evidence to support their findings. Loud guys with blow-horns shouting at conferences. I felt like this film was one step away from promoting tin-foil hats and bomb-shelters. Just my two-cents."
4,"Untidy, Still Revealing and Edifying","A patchwork of highly revealing documentary films put together by Alex Jones, albeit in a way that leaves viewers wanting. In the first part, the Bilderberg topic could be better explained, rather than spending time on long and futile sequences of activist scenes in Ottawa, running and driving around with cameras pointing at buildings and security guards (once the point is made, gotta move on!).On the other hand, the New World Order agenda and the dark history of Eugenics in the second part is more interesting and better structured.All in all, the viewer cannot remain unfazed after being presented with such strong arguments. Something obscure has been, and definitely is, taking place in some high levels of government and society."
5,Really Really good,"Some of the best stuff Alex has ever done. Check this video out, please just buy it for the cause if nothing else. It will hit number one!!!!"
5,Awesome!,Alex Jones is a true patriot and anyone who is at least 35 and older should realize now how America has been going down hill and what The New World Order has been doing with our puppet Presidents. End Game is just another valuable tool to educate any non-believer.
5,Every American Needs to View This,"This video, in the beginning, may seem boring; however, it lays the ""GROUNDWORK"" for what you need to know when they get into the ""GLOBAL"" plans by the elite to activate plans made for humanity on all the earth, since the end of World War I - our young people especially need to know this is real and need to realize that if they do nothing about it, there is nothing we (the older generation) can do to help them, as we will soon not be here to tell them ""how the world ""used to be"" - We bought copies for our grandchildren."
4,Beginner or do you know what this is talking about?,"I was waiting with anticipation for this film to come live on prisonplanet.tv, but I felt a little let down, I understand what is going on, but the docu, in my opinion, seems to have a disconnect when it comes to eugenics, I dont know how to give it to people right when it comes to that, but it just seems like that part could turn off alot of people and that would make people shrug off the whole film (i hope not)THE FILM IS GREAT, dont get me wrong, I just think more ppl will be left in the dark with the End Game thoughts and not want to believe, and that in turn is what we fight against, people need to know and not dismiss these beliefs. Not an introductory film to the masses, I would give it 5 stars, but these shortcomings (imo) make me have to give it 4.Thanks for being a patriot AlexRIP Aaron Russo"
2,Watch free ! It left me feeling confused and depressed.,"This documentary is very long. It left me feeling confused and depressed. Mostly it's two old, angry white guys yelling into a mic at world elites. If this small group is planning on enslaving the world how is yelling at them going to help? Are there ways of preventing this from happening? Like all global politics it's rich vs. poor and the rich are playing all angles. Wouldn't it make more sense to roll out global military power all at once? GOOGLE END GAME - FIRST LINK - WATCH FOR FREE ONLINE"
1,I must be in the minority...,This is real Grade D- Michael Moore type reporting. Sound bytes taken out of context and inuendo are not data that support the conclusion that this group wants to reduce the population by 80% and rule the remaining 20% with an iron fist.The Bilderberg Group Meetings are without a doubt meant to apply maximum pressure on lawmakers to sway policy to maximize profits and minimize the cost of doing business.Stating that the Bilderbegers are toiling towards a one world government is not proof that they are working for a one world government. A list of attendees is shown in this film - but no mention of the committees or projects the attendees are currently working on. Much of this information is publicly available.Watch this on Halloween around a campfire.
1,I Love Hyperbole!,"ENDGAME is wonderful! The hyperbole is awesome! I especially liked it WHEN THE GUY STARTS SHOUTING ALL THE TIME. That was good!I hate serious documentaries with facts and graphs and intelligence. This one blew me away with its rampant disinformation and cool chase for some list. Wow!I'm sure I learned a lot, I think."
4,Hot book just wish there had been a little more plot,No Surrender is a good read but I wish there had been more of a love relationship between the characters. This book is good for a light sexy read. I'd read more from this author.
5,Is Passion a powerful ruler?,"I have to agree with the first reviewer. THIS BOOK IS HOT,HOT,HOT AND HOT,THEN WE HAVE ...,...,... AND MORE ....A madam twisted ego brought them together. A king command ripped them apart. But the single night of shattering ... pleasure they shared has not dimmed in Fawkes de cressy memory.For three years he has waited to return to Mordeaux Castle and claim Lady Nicola Mortimer as his own forever.Yet upon his approach,Mordeaux army attacks and all signs point to treachery on her part. Suddenly Fawkes is torn between desire and distrust.FOR while victory in battle has won him the Lady Nicola,he is no longer certain he knows the woman with whom he has dreamed of sharing his bed and life. Whispers of a dangerous secret Nicola keeps only makes Fawks more determined to bend her to his will.But will it be he who surrenders his heart?This book is a must read and a keeper."
3,Hard to understand,"This was a required text for one of the classes in my Masters in Social Work program. The content explaining the different theoretical approaches was certainly appropriate. However, the style of writing made the content more difficult to understand than necessary. Many times, I needed to reread a section, only to ask myself why the authors used so many words to say something simple. The cases studies were helpful. I did like how some of the studies highlighted the different techniques as they were being used. Overall, the book was too time consuming to try to understand and really get the gist of the ideas the authors were trying to convey."
5,The Most Comprehensive Clinical Social Work text to date,"Professors Joan Granucci Lesser and Marlene Cooper have shown themselves to be the newest dynamic duo of clinical social work. This text, one of the most refreshing and comprehensive in the field, will surely become a standard read for all social work students in the years to come.Refreshing, consice, yet exceptionally detailed and well presented, ""Clinical Social Work Practice"" may very well define an entire generation of Social Work students. A must read for any student interested in the clinical social work field. Drs. Lesser and Cooper have shown themselves to be masters in the art of therapy, and their genius is apparent in their first textbook."
3,An artistic masterpiece with a bad remaster,"One of the most stunning performances of the Chairman at his very best. The remaster - however - is not up to the level of excellence that this work deserves. Sound is really too harsh and ""dry"". The album is simply a must have in any music lover's collection, but look for the original CD release."
1,Sounds bad!,"I didn't like the Concord release of ""The Concert Sinatra."" I can't listen to it. I think it sounds very hard, brittle, dry, lifeless, digital. Just awful. The vocal tone is the worst yet in the series of remixes that Concord has put out. I've been disappointed with all of them.If you own the mono Reprise LP, stick with that one."
4,GOOD SOLID DISC FROM THE CHAIRMAN,Together with Nelson Riddle handling the Arrangements&Conducting The Music Frank Sinatra Sounds Really Strong here.His VOice is in Peak Form here.THis Disc Shows why His Voice alone is TImeless.You'll Never Walk Alone is the Song.
4,Lush Sinatra,"There is no swing or swagger on this album. So for many, including myself, that is a big dissapointment. This is a 'serious' effort by Sinatra & Riddle to make an album as if they were giving a concert in the Milan opera house to a bunch of rich people in the early 1900's. The arrangements are a little bit overdone & dramatic. Still, old blue eyes gives some incredible vocal performances. I wouldnt recommend this album for someone just starting a Sinatra collection, this should be your 6 or 7th purchase of Frank's catalog. Still, the album kind of works as a concept album, along his other more recognized efforts."
2,"remastered, expanded, but......","not quite sure why there is so much praise for that particular album ???remastered does not necessarily mean better sound..well, it sounds alright but I could easily live without that very albumnot MY cup of tea but was wroth a try"
2,Not for Pits,I bought this because it was recommended for tough chewers but my pitbull destroyed it immediately. If you really have a dog that's a heavy chewer stick with the Kong.
5,The truth revealed,This book exposes not only the weaknesses of evolution but also the lack of faith by many in the Christian community. Those who believe in creationism and in evolution should especially read this book to learn how wrong you are.
1,Didn't even finish this book,"I didn't even finish this book, I put it down after 80 pages. I actually wanted to see the opposite argument to natural selection,To see if it had any merit or even just the slightest bit of validity. It doesn't. This book is almost for natural selection andEvolution because the argument it makes for creationism is a terrible joke."
5,Outstanding and eye-opening,"This book is straightforward and challenging. We who are believers cannot compartmentalize our beliefs about the origin of man and all that exists if we want to be authentic. If we have been born anew by the Spirit of God into His kingdom, have thus become His children, we know the Bible is the Word of God. If we know the Bible is the Word of God, we know sin and death did not enter the world until after man had sinned. There could not have been eons of death before man appeared on the scene.This book is chockful of information which every Christian needs to know and understand. I highly recommend it to every believer who is serious about de-compartmentalizing his or her life so that the mind and soul are completely renewed by the transforming power of God's Word. (Romans 12:1-2)"
3,General,"This book provides an extremely *basic* overview of the issue--it is not a book dealing with the scientific issues whatsoever. But that is not the purpose of the author, at least in the view of this reader.It offers a good introduction to the importance of the doctrine of creation to the biblical world view."
1,"half lies, half not","Ham gets it right that evolution is baseless. But his strange and antibiblical theories about no death before adam and the universe being young are ridicolous and unfounded. He doesn't support his claims, only makes emotional pleads. I suppose all the cells ""dying and decaying"" as I sit here is evil. Strip away the emotionalism, and you see death is needed for life. His theology is plainly deceptive and is attacks on others unwarranted. Ham is not even qualified to teach on this subject. For real discussions on evolution, that use facts and not emotions and deceptions, see the books of Phillip Johnson, Behe, Denton and Ross."
5,Best book I've ever read on the relevence of Genesis,"This book is superb: it's very clearly written, very Biblical, exceedingly well-writen and very informative. However, I don't think it's titled right - it's not so much evidence against the theory of evolution as on the relevence of Genesis, but it's still superb! I'd recommend it to anyone, especually those who think that the creation/evolution issue isn't important and/or believe in an interpertation other than six-day literal creation."
1,lmihay,"I will keep my review short. Don't buy the book. I will tell you what it says ""Genesis is literal and Evolution is a lie."" It won't tell you why it is a lie, but he argues it is. No science in the entire book. Some of his philosophy makes sense, but anyone could come to his conclusions, even an atheist. It was a terrible waste of time."
2,Pretty Sad,"The author has the right idea. He does understand how dangerous the theory of evolution is. The problem is, his whole book could be summed up in 1 chapter. He just keeps hammering the same thing over and over about the evils of evolution. WE KNOW! That why I bought the book. Unfortunately, it had no useful information about scientific evidence of creationism (it is out there, but for some strange reason, he didn't put any in the book!) So, basically this is a ""pump-up, go get em"" kind of book, which is not what I wanted."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read - I returned it,As a devout Christian... this totally embarrasses me. Ignorance like this is what pushes people away... obviously he knows nothing about science!
1,Horrible,"Deceptive, unscientific, erroneous and biased. Worthless. The sad thing is that some people believe everything written in this work that religiously rapes science, because they have no understanding of real science and logic. Here's something for the people that gave this book good ratings: first get yourself some real university level science books about Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Geology, and even Maths (since erroneous basic logic is utilised in this book). When you have studied and understood these, read this work again, and realise how flawed it is."
1,Psuedoscience at its finest,"Creation science is not a 'science', in any sense. It is an attempt to rescue one interpretation of the Bible from the 'evil Satan' of evolutionary theory. We might as well start passing edicts burning evolutionary scientists at the stake and force them to 'repent' their belief that life evolved, much as the Catholic Church forced Galileo to recant his belief the Earth orbited the Sun.It is as ridiculous as trying to defend Astrology as a system with equal validity to modern Astronomy."
2,Erroneous Method,"A serious and core error of Ham's book, typical of the creationist genre, is the mistaken belief that large, intricately complex structures necessarily imply a creator. Rather than speculate about distant subjects such as ancient species origin, let's look at something clearly knowable and only 2,000 years old. My Ph.D. is in linguistics and I have taught or directly supervised instruction in over two dozen languages. Each language is an extremely, elaborately complex, multi-systemic structure. Two thousand years ago, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, etc., didn't exist. They exist today, each as a highly complex structure, but none was created. Each simply evolved from spoken Latin; the evolution of each is known and documented. It is simply unnecessary to postulate the existence of a creator to account for multi-layered, highly organized structures."
1,uhh...,"i'm really getting sick of this guy. all he does is diss people who are liberal and or believe in evolution. i don't like it how he blames evolution for all the world's problems. i have nothing against those who don't believe in evolution, but just cause someone dosen't have your same views, doesn't mean you can diss it."
1,"Oh, so evolutionists will hate this ""expose""?",Fat chance! This is actually an expose of creationism's inability to account for the fossil record and everything around us!
1,sorry,"Sorry, God is not real. He was made up just like Greek mythology. He was the explanation for things man could not figure out."
4,I want to truth. Not lies.,"This is the truth that evolution is a lie. God's Word is the truth.Heb 4:12, 13For the word of God (Bible) is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight.Rom 1:25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator-who is forever praised. Amen."
1,A Lie,"Amazon.com should put a disclaimer at the top of every page displaying Reviews that this book contradicts scientific understanding of the theory of human origins. It's like ""Mein Kampf""--that book should have a disclaimer too, stating that it's a racist, fanatic diatribe.As far as a substantive review goes: This book offers the argument that evolutionary theory is false, based on purportedly scientific reasoning. But its alternative theory, creationism, is, like evolutionary theory, subject to uncertainty--but the evidence for creationism is far less solid than that for evolution, so this book's argument is very weak. Deserves zero stars."
3,Preaching to the Choir,"I enjoy Ken Ham's children's books but have not been pleased with any of his works for adults that I have read. The Lie Evolution is an evangelical book citing very little science or history. Ham is very passionate in his mission and while I agree with most of his points, one has to ask to whom is this book intended? The wording and dogmatic language used will hold little appeal to any who do not agree with the author and those who do agree really do not need to be reminded why in such an manner. I would recommend the words of G Thomas Sharp, Understanding the Times, and [...] over this work."
1,"What a big, steaming pile.","It seriously worries me that there is a whole subculture in this country that actually thinks like this. What you have here is your basic American Taliban campaign to establish a theocracy. It's pretty laughable. The idea that adherents to this kind of blatantly flawed thinking recently controlled the White House, though, not so funny. People who think like this should not hold any power at all, in Afghanistan or here in the US. You're free to think the earth is whatever shape you want it to be, but that doesn't make you right."
2,"Disappointing: what I needed, not what I wanted","I expected evidence, I was disappointed to get something perhaps better -- a clear presentation of presuppositionalism. The entire book can be summarized by the book's quotation from The Southern Skeptic, Volume 2 Number 5, Autumn 1985, which covers the Skeptical position: ""Even if all the evidence ended up supporting whichever scientific theories best fitted Genesis, this would only show how clever the old Hebrews were in their use of common sense, or how lucky. It does not need to be explained by unobservable God."" Skeptics work rationally-- from the presupposition that that there is no God, and merely interpret the evidence thusly. This is the Bayesian notion that nothing is ""objective"": that you must have some initial belief. Christian theists work rationally-- from the presupposition that humans are special, and we did not create ourselves. Your presupposition reveals your heart, and your mind follows."
1,Faith Building?,"I like that the most favorable review on Amazon for this garbage is titled ""Faith Building"". It just goes to show that the dolts who eat up this nonsense are not exactly truth oriented. If you like facts twisted into Bible based world view and love Jesus over reality this books for you!"
4,Holton Takes A Vacation,"Definitely a much more readable and applicable discussion of dynamic meteorology than the archetype book by Holton.Part II is more geered toward operational forecasting and if you had dynamic meteo in college and still have Holton, only purchase Part II. Part I is a nice review of what you should have all ready known and only really used again since college if you are in grad school...otherwise, Part 2 is great, detailing synoptic wx systems and the interaction with QGOE forcing, etc...a nice comprehensive review, and some things new too, well worth the buy (only drawback is the price, ouch!!!)"
3,Relies too much on anecdotal evidence,"While I don't have a generally negative attitude towards globalization, I was disappointed by this book. My hope was to find a scientific argument that puts what seems to be fragmentary and anecdotal evidence against globalization in perspective. Instead, the author simply counters anecdotal evidence by other anecdotal evidence. For instance, he uses the example of his own maid to argue that migrant women, who leave their home countries and children behind, often do so voluntarily. This is a game which, as reviewer Baumgartner points out, can be played ad infinitum, but ultimately leaves the reader with no new insight."
3,In Defense of Globalization,It is a very optimistic view of globalization. A few of the chapters are far to short to really address how serious the issue is. Quick read.. weird comparisons at times.
2,"A good, but biased, introduction to globalization.","In this work, Bhagwati offers valid arguments for globalization. He is takes some of the strongest criticisms of globalization and is able to find fault in them, and at the same time, declares the benefits of a globalized economy.However, one need not read the entire book to find out Bhagwati's views. Bhagwati's stance on globalization is almost so extreme that he instinctively and automatically comes to the defense of globalization without providing a fair analysis. As a Harvard professor, I would assume him to provide more academic and holistic defenses and criticisms. However, his book is an easy read and one that opens the reader to arguments for and against globalization whether s/he has previous knowledge of globalization or not."
4,Gives you good color,"My lotion got here SUPER fast and sealed! I wasn't expecting it that quick. I used the bombshell lotion for the first time today. It wasn't bad, it does tan you very good. This is my first time with a tingle lotion so it will take some getting use to. I'm personally not a huge fan of the tingle feeling but it does give you good color in the end."
4,"Definitely worth working through, but not all that ""ultramodern""","First off, Joe Diorio is a major, major talent and this book, like all his others, has loads to transmit. I was at a place in my playing where I knew I needed a new approach to soloing; I intuitively felt it'd be a help to start thinking more ""intervallically,"" so when I found this book I thought Perfect! It definitely opened new approaches for me and certainly broadened my understanding of what it means to think in intervals rather than scales, scales, scales. I do think, though, that the sound of these lines aren't at all ""ultramodern""; many of them, if used in a jamming situation actually come across sounding like exercises. The idea with this book is to absorb the core concepts and then apply the approach to what you're already using in your soloing. It broadens horizons, but shouldn't be looked upon as a book of soloing ideas as such."
4,Energy Audits and Energy Conservation Principles,"The Handbook of Energy Audits is written in a textbook format that makes it easy to follow and easy to find information you need without having to read the entire book. It is a comprehensive book that includes details for planning and conducting energy audits of a variety of facilities. The benchmark data on energy use (btu/sq ft) is very useful, but could be more detailed. This book is helpful to the person who needs to determine energy utilization and identify ways to conserve energy; however, it will not provide you with the information about your carbon footprint. With engineering knowledge one can take gather the information using these principles and then calculate the carbon footprint and other metrics for your busines.Taking Care of the Basics"
3,"dude, this could've been better","Damn, I'm a huge Nofx fan! There's never been a Nofx album I didn't like. Until now. I didn't hate this album but I'm not feelin it that much. Some good songs here and there. Some bummers in my opinion. Maybe it could grow on me but that's usually not the way it is with them. If you're just getting into Nofx check out there older albums like Ribbed, white trash two heebs and a bean, punk in drublic, etc..."
2,WHY???,"17 or 18 songs that shouldnt even be considered to go on 45 or 46 songs that werent good enough to make it to our other records. I have every cd that nofx has ever put out, even that ep that came out in europe, leave it alone. There is about 3 or 4 songs that were decent, the other ones I really hope they don't plan on playin at there shows. How can you put out an album like War on Errorism, then follow through with this album.Top 5 albums (to me):#5: Pump Up The Valuum#4: Punk in Drublic#3: War On Errorism#2: Ribbed#1: White Trash 2 Heebs and a Bean"
3,Typical NOFX album,"Was hoping that the Album would be full of emotion, a sure sign that the band really feels what they preach.Unforntunately it is not, seems to be more of a 'Fat Mike' information session. While a somewhat good album, not up to NOFX usually standard.If you like slower, lighter NOFX, buy this, if your into more hardcore stuff (The Seperation of Church and Skate for example) i don't recomend it."
4,wow!,"My first impression of NoFX's new album was: thumbs up. There weren't any tracks that I felt the need to skip through (except for maybe the random Spanish song). I also think that the lyrics are really well-written - you definately get a dose of good quality NoFX-style-satirical-antiAmerica-that's-so-true humour in this one. My favourite track has to be the hilariously ironic Leaving Jesusland. The bonus of buying this album is that you get a free sample CD of other Fat Wreck Chords bands (I'm not sure if they all come with this, but anyways). You get a generous 16 tracks of pretty good songs...even though some struck me as a little screamo-emo at first, but I'll give them another listen. Overall, make sure you read through the lyrics to get the full experience from this album. NoFX fans will be pleased with this one."
2,Well 1 bad CD is still a great running...,"I love NOFX. I have all their CDs and have loved everyone of them - previously. HOWEVER, I resold ""Wolves in Wolves' Clothing"" on eBay because it was so poor. It's not like I'm expecting every CD to be Punk in Drublic, but this one was a real steamer. But, hey... one bad CD... I can let that slide. Just don't buy it. p.s. If they play any of the songs off it at their upcoming House of Blues Vegas concert, they might end up with another pair of shoes!UPDATE: The did play 90% new stuff off Wolves at the Vegas show and it sucked. Only high point was that ""Nubs"" - the chick with no arms and no legs song off their last album... she actually exists (as described) and was on stage to the side at one point! I saw them recently (11/08) in Baltimore and they played NO songs off of Wolves and it was GREAT, so there all you have it."
1,Very disappointed!!!,I never thought that I would every receive something that was in the kind of condition that this product was. As soon as I opened the box I could tell that it was broken. It looked like some one just shoved a screw that didn't even fit into it. One of the straps were broken and the pins on the bottom kept coming out. I would expect this kind of quality from a 0.99 cent store! I will NEVER get something from this company again online!
3,Wished for More Commentary,"A collection of excerpts from Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon and Polybius. The selection takes us from the history of the Pelopenessian war, through the attempted Athenian conquest of Sicily, the Persian civil wars and up to the Roman conquest. The narration and commentary by M.I. Finley is probably a bit too brief for the reader not familiar with the Greeks, and yest is probably not necessary for the true scholar. The translations are easy to digest and written in very approachable English. All in all, the book is 500+ pages of Greek history by four great writers, but the set up and the commentary are too sparse to make it a great read for the non-scholar."
4,Linden Living,My husband loved this tie. It was of very good quality and the labs are very colorful and bright on the tie.
3,Wonder What she is doing tonight,How many have asked that question. I know they were great writers but on this CD I didn't find all that many songs that I liked. If you are a fan then I'm sure it would be pf greater interest to you. Took a chance.
3,Well......,"Unlike the other guy i got my order just two days after i placed the order. And i don't know what he's talking about, but my collars look just like the ones in the picture, except mine have black handles. My complaint is they don't fit my bar, which defeats the whole reason for having them. Maybe it's not the collars but the bar that's not right. Either way I'm out 9 bucks."
1,Received Wrong Sensor.,"Ordered It, Arrived 2 Days later. I Opened Package, And Received Wrong Sensor.. Disappointment. It was the Same Wire Input But Was Too Long To Fit Rubber Grommet. For Some Reason It Was made Of Copper? I DON'T Recommend This To ANYBODY."
5,Coraline Steroids.,"If you have a REEF-tank or a F.O.W.L.R-tank, this stuff is a must. You will be amazed at how much faster the coraline algae will grow."
1,Purple up Algae Accelerator,i have been using this product for about two months and so far haven't seen much of a change!!
2,I think it works,"I have a reef tank, but i'm just not sure if this product works. It does increase the calcium levels in the tank simply because it is a solution of pulverized argonite or other calcium compound. I had great success with a part a&b solution. My father uses it and likes it but it does leave the argonite residue on everything, and it has harden in the sump so when it is disturbed, white flakes shoot out the return."
4,Excellent stories dealing with Magic,"""The Magic Goes Away Collection"" has stories from three separate collections of stories that are from ""The Magic Goes Away"" fantasy universe created by Larry Niven. All the stories are good. I think Larry Niven's stories are particularly good.The novella, ""The Magic Goes Away"", was the start of this universe and is based on a new concept for Magic universes. Larry did good!There are some stories by other authors, but they are good, too.I recommend this book for anyone who has ever enjoyed a magic-centered fantasy."
4,The magic has returned!,"The idea of magic as a non-renewable resource is such a simple, logical concept that once you see it you wonder why everyone isn't treating it that way. It just makes everything so much more interesting because it ties magic in with the real world. This is a great collection of stories by various authors. As you might expect, because of this the styles and quality tend to vary as well, which is why I took off a star."
2,How to make a boy or girl baby,"Disappointed!!It was cute, but for fun purposes only. It was not really worth the price. If you can pick one up at a yard sale or used book store it is maybe 5 minutes of reading."
4,One defect,"Aside from one defect, which was annoying but not worth the hassle of returning it, it was pretty much as described. The high rating I gave isn't because it is of great quality, but because it was great quality for the price ($300). They would only deliver it M-F 9-5 (no evening or weekend delivery), which was very inconvenient, since those are the hours I work. Also, they wouldn't give me an appointment either, so I had to be home all day. The rack isn't packed well, and is both heavy and awkward, but the delivery guy helped me get it inside and waited for me to open it. It's easy to assemble, although having an extra pair of hands to hold it in place helps. No parts were missing."
4,GOOD BUY,"THIS TOY SHOTGUN IS VERY FUN FOY YOUNGSTERS OR LITTLE KIDS. THE SMOKE IS A LITTLE REALISTIC, BUT IS NOT THE BEST. THE SOUND IT MAKES IS NICE, BUT AFTER HEREING IT A FEW TIMES IT GETS A LITTLE ANOYING. THE GUN OVERALL LOOKS NICE. THIS GUN GETS A 4. GREAT BUY!"
2,Not so smooth...,"Synopsis: Needed a replacement grip handle for chest press, cable dips, curls etc.Pros: Good rough grip and hole is large enough for good size clip. Grip is wide enough for my XXXlarge hands (hamhocks)Cons: As grip rotates around frame during exercise, you can feel the roughness of the inside finish and a clicking noise. This is possibly due to poor weld or burs inside of the grip or on the frame itself."
3,Single cable handles,"The handles are excellent; I used theses two I purchased to attach to eye-bolts with a T-nut to do shoulder shrugs on a manual leg extension machine. The quality of the handles can not be beat, they are perfect for my application.Sincerely,Fred A. Hisle"
5,Good buy!,"These are commercial gym quality handles, like another person already said, they are much better quality and more comfortable than the cheap ones that come with most home gyms. Price is affordable and product will be long lasting. Highly recommend."
4,Good Deal on a handle,"Nice sturdy handle for a great price. My only knock is the handle is a little rough on the hands, had to wrap it with a piece of cloth."
4,Solid piece of equipment at a great price!,Not much to say about this handle but it is solid and the price was great. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,Single chrome handle,Just like the one I used in the professional gyms. It is solid well made and worth the money spent
4,great show disappointed there are no Italy episodes,I bought this dvd box set and I was satisfied with the quality. I was disappointed that this set excludes all the episodes when the family goes to Italy.
5,Great Brush!,This is an excellent hair brush. Nice handle. I have very thin hair and it works great. A friend of mine with super thick hair has borrowed this before when she's stayed over and it's even worked well for her.
4,pot,I just wanted an extra light weight pot and this works not crazy about the narrow bottom it leaves alot of exposed burner
1,Between Two Worlds,What an amazing story! I am particularly happy to have read about Baghdad before Saddam came into power. I am so sad to know what happened in Iraq because of him. The author gives an engaging account that was a real page turner.
2,sadam-bashing,"Was a good read until I realised most of it was Saddam bashing from the angst ridden & hurtful author. As you read through the book it's not hard to understand how the course of events has left emotional scars on her family, and I guess you can surmise, the afghan population as well.Nevertheless, this is a first-hand emotional account of a girl who grew up being a ""personal"" friend of saddam. She paints out, from her perspective, the private life and character of the person we read so much about in the papers, and maybe sheds some understanding on why his people wanted to execute him for war crimes."
5,Good show,"This is a great DVD. My 11-month-old daughter loves Chuggington. It's a very upbeat and positive show. I wish there were a few more episodes on here, since they're each only about 10 minutes long, but this is a good hour's worth of entertainment for the price."
4,Shucks...,"We LOVE Chuggington in our home. We DVR all the episodes on the Disney channel and my son cannot get enough. I was a little disappointed to learn (after I received the DVD) that it contained 6 episodes (of which we already have on our DVR). I didn't read the description before pre-ordering it. I just saw the title ""Ride the Rails"" and saw that the length was over 60 mins and assumed that it was a movie. Phooey. My fault. I guess this will go to grandmas house, no harm. I'm just bummed I paid for something I already had for free. :("
4,Great show!,"We were so excited when Chuggington came out on DVD, however, I didn't realize that there's only 6 episodes and each episode is only about 15 minutes long, so this is shorter than most kids dvds. Also, there are so many great episodes, and most of the kids favorites did not make it onto this dvd. And when watching the show in tv, they have a ""Badge Quest"" in between each episode, the dvd does not. We DVD the episodes, and actually prefer to watch those instead of the DVD.Chuggington is a great show though. It is very kid friendly and much easier to watch and understand than the Thomas the Train show. Chuggington teaches values and is really a great show. I enjoy watching it with my kids and would have loved the DVD to be longer and have some of the better episodes. Especially since it took such a long time to come out on DVD."
5,His Best Yet,His first recording since 1999's wonderful Beautiful Wreck of the World may be his best yet.If you have never heard him before this would be a good place to start.A basic roots rocker in the Mellancamp Springsteen mode Willie Nile has been too long a secret.This is a great record.
5,nile's new disc deserves to be heard!,"after finally finding the right distributer willie releases acollection of songs that rank right up there withspringsteen's latest couple of efforts. in some cases such as""faded flower of broadway"", ""cell phones"", ""back home"", ""streetsof new york"" willie has written better songs than the boss.the disc is loaded with hooks and catchy melodies while rockinhard but not so as to overwhelm the disc's excellent lyrics.well worth the purchase for rock fans waiting/longing forintelligent,well crafted rock n' roll."
4,Real Disco Brazilian,Very good Disco music from the 70's.Very original.This music have a very beautiful portugese liryc.I recomend this CD to all people who 70's and brazilian music.
3,Nice Photographs of Georgia's works.....,"I enjoyed the selection of paintings and photographs. However, I would say this was a rather sanitized version of Georgia's life. The narrator stated her happy marriage--yet it was a marriage where there were lots of difficulties. Interesting pieces of information regarding why she painted what she painted or regarding her character were ignored---I read the book; Full Bloom: The Art and Life of Georgia O'Keeffe [Hardcover] by Hunter...and I was quite impressed by all the personal information about Georgia. Georgia's life was not as sweet and blissful as the narrator's text seems to portray.I found the visual quite effective and turned the audio portion off."
1,So disappointed I had to write you all,This review is of Great Women Artists: Geogia O'Keefe.In viewing this DVD I was incredibly frustrated with the presenters decision to rarely let you see the whole painting but instead constantly focus on a portion of a Georgia O'Keefe painting. Later if he deemed it necessary he would let us see the whole painting (but mostly not). My husband and I become increasingly aggitated and finally really mad. What was good about the video were the photos of her and scenes of the mountains and Ghost Ranch. Also some of the paintings were ones I don't remember ever seeing. If you have a great book of her paintings this may not irritate you but I don't recommend this particular video.
2,"Great music, misleading package","The sticker on the cover of this CD proclaims ""First time EVER available on CD!"" but that's not quite true. Originally released in 1954 on two ten-inch LPs as ""Jazzical Moods"" volumes 1 and 2, these tracks (plus one that doesn't appear on ""Jazz Experiments"") were previously released on CD under the original title by Fantasy/OJC in 1995.This ""Jazz Experiments"" CD actually duplicates a Bethlehem 12-inch LP reissue of the material. Presumably one selection was omitted due to the limitations of the LP format.The earlier OJC version (which is still available), besides containing all of the music, also includes Charles Mingus's complete original liner notes, which are severely edited in the ""Jazz Experiments"" booklet.The music is faultless, but fans will prefer the earlier, complete issue. Also, those who own the OJC should be warned that they already have everything on this disc, and more."
4,God's Promises,A great reminder of God's promises that we sometimes take lightly. Sometimes as singles we tend to forget we are special without being married.
5,Simply astounding,I searched and this TV was the best for the price. I didn't buy it from Amazon.com but I should have because it was ridiculously hard to find. This TV is so great that stores usually have it on back order so you might have to wait like 2 weeks to get one. I lucked out and found a dealer who had one left.The picture quality on this TV is awesome. I'm using my Playstation 2 with it to watch DVDs and play video games and the detail in the picture is breathtaking. I was also surprised at how good the sound was. Every track of the movies seem to come out crystal clear and have depth to them. I never thought that the two speakers on a TV this size could do this.If you buy this TV and are using it to watch DVDs either with a PS2/Xbox or player I strongly suggest you buy some component video cables. These cables give the absolute best quality.Best 300$ I ever spent.
3,"Toshiba 24"" TV 24AFF44","I bought this TV 2 months ago and the picture is crisp. I cannot setup the TV since I received a defective remote and I shipped it back. I ended up with a $60 refund because target.com did not have any additional remotes for the TV. Not a bad deal, but now no universal remote is able to be setup with the television. I'm left getting up to turn the tv on and off and changing the volume. Recommend the television, but not the remote that comes with it."
2,Works great except with TiVo,"I bought one of these yesterday, and loved the picture. When I hooked it up to my TiVo, there was a very regular hiss....hiss...hiss, even at low volume settings. I did a lot of experimenting, and found that it fails with both TiVo's, and the problem is worse with a longer audio/video cable or an A/V switch. Even with the short cable, it has a very bad hiss if the red audio cable is not hooked up. It looks like a bad ground in the audio input of the TV. The TiVo's work fine with my HT Receiver, and my Panasonic TV, even at high volume levels. Don't know if it is just this set, or a design problem. It does sound fine with other inputs (DVD, etc.) but it is not usable with TiVo."
5,Asking a question,"I want to ask a question, if I am not watching my TV for a couple of hours is it better to turn it off or leave it on?"
1,Remote does not work,"I received this TV this week, the remote control does not work, and Toshiba customer service is unresponsive. I have emailed and tried to phone a number of times with no response. I'm very frustrated, so I would not recommed this product. Horrible."
3,"Good, but with unnecessary flaws","This figure is an obvious huge step forward compared to the original line. It looks wicked, dangerous and dope-style. However, because of the permanent damage McFarlane has done to action figures, it isnt as posable as it should be, nor does it know how to hold a weapon. :-("
5,Skeletor: The evil king of darkness has returned!,"This is a superior figure. The meticulous detail and finishing by the Four Horsemen sculptors brings the Masters of the Universe line to a new high. Not only having his original look and havok staff, but he also has a sword that detaches and becomes two. The paint job is clean and makes him look severe.It also has some improved articulation from its predecessor in 1982, such as swiveling wrists and ball jointed arms.The only negative I can find is that, I wish they would have a few more joints in knees and elbows. If properly placed they would be a valued asset to this awesome toy.Masters of the Universe 2002, brings back the history of the original as well as the history A+ guys."
5,"Now, THIS is a villain!","Skeletor was one of the most feared TV villains of the 80's. Now he's back with an evil new look. While the sculpting, detail and poseability of this figure are great. The paint job is hardly something to be proud of."
5,Handsome teacher comes under the spell of beguiling pupil.,"THE FLAVOR OF CORN(Italy, 1994) Director: Gianni Da Campo. Cast: Lorenzo Lena and Marco Mestriner. Color. Italian with English subtitles. Running time: 95 minutes. Unrated.Lorenzo, a handsome first-year professor in an isolated Italian village, falls under the spell of his most beguiling pupil, a dark-haired, starry-eyed 12-year-old named Duilio. As Lorenzo's relationship with his heartless girlfriend deteriorates, he finds himself walking the fields with his loving student. When their idyllic friendship is questioned by Duilio's suspicious stepmother, Lorenzo is brought to a crisis of conscience. THE FLAVOR OF CORN is a bittersweet ode to male friendship and the confusion of first love. Contains nudity and sexual situations."
3,Solid bar at a good price!,"This is a solid bar at a good price. It has the revolving attachment that is nice. It is about what I expected and the price was fair. The only thing I am slightly disappointed with is the angle where it attaches to the cable. It is kind of hard to describe, but when I use it on my low cable doing rows the bars are not perpendicular to the cable. I think this is because the swivel part is not centered between the handles. I'm not sure if other bars are like this or centered more. It's not a deal breaker but if I was making one I'd look into this. I'd give it 3.5 stars. Hope this helps."
3,Somewhat Let Down,"This is not an indictment of the artist, as I have heard him several times before in person and also have a Christmas CD of his, which I love. The purity of Chris' voice is so amazing, that I think it is best set off with just his guitar as an accompaniment. On this CD, I think the attempt to make it ""more"" was not the best choice. Although the songs are fine, there's too much other stuff going on in the background ( drums, etc.) that I think detract from, rather than add to, what the listener really wants to hear--which is, simply, Chris' voice. This is a testament to his own instrument--he doesn't need a lot of extras to enhance his music. I hope he makes another CD soon, with just his guitar accompanying him (which he is wonderful at, as well). I will buy that one in a heartbeat."
5,Everyone who hears his voice says wow,I came across Chris Wilson singing in Hong Kong avout 4 years ago. My friends and I went back every night. We each bought a CD. Just tonight a friend in Paris heard this album and was entranced. He asked why he had never heard of Chris Wilson. I still wonder why he's not more widely known.
3,Great Voice but poor instrumentals,"I picked up this album off the street from Chris nearly 3 years ago. It was a week or so before Christmas, and I was out shopping on the 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica and stopped and listened to him play for a bit. It was incredible. I mean, I just sat there on the curb and listened and was completely entranced.And then I got this album from him and was a bit disappointed. Such a great voice. But the instrumentals behind him are too synthesized. I must say ... does a wonderful cover of ""Crazy Love"" on this album, though."
5,Exactly what I needed and more.,"I'm tinking about doing my own 35mm and 120 film developing and was recommended this book by some peers. The book is excactly what I was looking for. It contains not only an overview of film and developing, but details on processing film and prints. There's even an exposure calculator in the print section.I didn't need the info on prints because I'll be scanning negatives into my computer, but if I ever do want to do prints I already have the info now.The data and instructions for developing film are great. It really spells it out step by step with diagrams in the perfect place. Of course this is all about Kodak film, but in reality it will apply to any films. If a film is special in some way, it should come with it's own instructions on developing chemicals and teperatures."
1,Do NOT buy this...,"My dad bought this TV about 13-14 months ago. Never worked right; always dropping parts of the picture, going out for no reason. Well, now it's dead. Philips is giving him the runaround about fixing it (again)."
2,Its okay,"Im not sure what i was expecting, the chain is pretty and the silver is very shiny but it is extremely thin so be careful that when you order it that you are looking for a thin chain and not a thicker one because this is absolutely thin. The clasp is also rather difficult to hook at times. Over all though I am still reasonably pleased with my purchase and i am just going to buy a different pendant for it"
5,Soothing Read,"A very, very gentle read in this day of ""way too vivid"" books. Probably not for action, sex, violence fans. This is a cup of tea, butter cookies, an open window and a gentle breeze, rocking chair and a bouquet of daisies book. Best enjoyed with the television OFF and quiet music playing. One of my go-to books when I need a break from a ""blaring"" day."
5,beautiful,"Got this as a gift for a girlfriend who had never seen goldstone, and was a redhead with green eyes and fair skin. Perfect match!"
5,"Not perfect, but a great deal!","The sheer quantity of chips makes up for them not being 100% clay.It was a great deal in the first place---one you won't find anywhere else so for that I have to say that I am definitely quite satisfied.My only concern is the weight of the case. It is pretty heavy. But hey, when you are sitting playing poker for 6 hours, you need exercise."
4,For the price -- good set,"For the price this 1000 chip set will do. The set came with exactly 1000 chips. 300/$1, 200/$5, 200/$10, 100/$25, 100/$100, 50/$500, 50/$1000. The set includes cut cards, 4 decks, dice, buttons. There are no extra chips, so if you are picky about perfect chips you will probably throw out quite a few. The carrying case is pretty sturdy though not perfect. Overall this set does everything you need it to do."
1,No,Just received these chips in the mail. They are garbage. They fell and sounds completely plastic. I had previously bought chips that were the same but real. I was looking to add to my set and these ruined it. Do not buy. Trust me you'll thank me later.
5,You want melody? This is melody!,"Joe Satriani had summed up a quote to describe Jan Cyrka's guitar playing: ""The only guitarist that's worth listening to"". He emphasizes melody over chops, thus created this masterpiece. What really amazes me is the way he make the solos breathe, wail, and moan, then reaches to a climax, as if he was telling a story. I definitely recommend to everyone who love soaring melodies."
4,Agree,"I agree with Neil Scotford from uk but feel that the 1992 album ""beyond the common ground"" was better than ""Spirit"". The song ""Sitting on eggs"" is one of my all time favourite tracks. But as Neil suggests Jan Cyrka is not JUST another speed guitar player .......this guy has the blues in his fingers and uses it. How people can listen to ""Surfing with the Alien"" compared to this is beyond me.......I've sold my Satriani albums and replaced them with Jan Cyrka!-Bret from Australia"
3,the music deserves better,"The attached program notes aren't very informative, but this recording seems to have been made at a live performance, which explains the occasional knocks and thuds. And the accoustics aren't great; the music often is unclear and distant. Washroom echoes. The singing is weak; here and there you may be reminded of mewing kittens. That said, the opera is wonderful, tuneful, gracious, and fun. I'd pass on this performance. The music deserves better. About 20 years ago DGG & Daniel Barenboim did a much better Matrimonio . Hope for for a re-release."
2,Cima-no-va...,"This is the worst excuse for an opera recording I've ever heard. The singers are horribly out of tune, the strings aren't together, and there is no english translation in the liner notes."
5,One of the best fantasy books to come out in a long time,"This simply is one of the best fantasy books to come out in a long time. Mrs Morland has come up with characters that reach out to you and tell you their story, and carry you along for the ride. I recommend this book highly for any fantasy reader, novice or long time junkie."
1,Filled with silly Cliches,"Ah, the average pretty princess who claims to be noble. The same man who's handsome and brave and the king of everything. I'm pretty sick of all these chiches, all these books are like carbon-copies of one another. I am hoping fantasy authors will somehow find something different to write about. Blah, this book was like any other.This is one that is easily forgotten."
1,Terrible! Horrid and Boring Story,"How much more underdeveloped could a book get? I wanted to punch the characters in the face for being so weak and pitiful, I pitied them to the point that I didn't care about them anymore. From page one I wasn't interested, until the laste page I was worn out from trying to finish.Never again will I read a book with so little reviews and a book by an amateur of fantasy."
2,X2gen Monitor,"This is a decent monitor but there is a BIG But, the company is out of business. Where does that leave a warranty. If your monitor breaks down the only choice is to trash it. Non-warranty repairs may cost more than a new monitor."
4,"Great price for a 19"" LCD",I purchased this for $159.99 after mail in rebate. For the price you can't go wrong. We'll see how long it takes to get the rebate money. If I have any issues I will report back.
2,"Either, it's Egghead site or the product itself.","I have purchased 2 of these for mulitple display use within 5 days apart. I have no Idea, if the website sell imperfect products or X2gen (blk version) is very low quality monitor.One of them have several dead pixel, other one have dark grey horizontal line going across the screen ( I didn't noticed in the beginning. {anyway they both are permenent}Previously I bought Silver version, same company different model had absolutly no flaud.I did heard about LCD having few/serveral dead pixel, but this is very first time for me. I have purchase at least 7 different type of LCD before, and it is very unpleasent experience.Can't return it, I don't save boxes."
4,great traditionel country,"when tommy detamore is involved it can only be something good.. and it is.. great songs,there is a lot of steel,twang guitar and good time... the lead singer sounds a little like jason allen. i hope this band will make some more albums like this.. there is not so much more to say... great country!!!"
5,Bandwagon,"Awesome CD! I bought it for ""Why you been gone so long?"" but I love the other tracks. I saw 1100 in concert in Plano TX and they blew the other bands away."
5,I HAVE THE POWER,"MY SON LOVES THESE HEMEN, BUT WE ARE ON THE THIRD ONE IF YOU DROP THEM THE HEADS AND HANDS BREAK OFF."
1,Disappionted!,"I was disappointed by this CD because these songs are different from the original recordings. Actually, you can't tell who these people are! Are they really the original members singing?Some of the songs sound OK, but most of them have such differentarrangiments from the originals that they don't sound right.Does anyone know if the original recordings are available?"
1,Annoyed....,"I decided to try out calligraphy as a complete beginner and this was the first set I bought. I liked the large variety of colors and multiple nibs of different sizes. However, as I tried it out for the first time, I realized that the pen seemed to dispense too much ink, causing the ink to run on the paper. Although the letters were still readable, the thick lines were indistinguishable from the thin. The effect was about the same as if the letters were written with any kind of marker or pen. I've experimented with different kinds of paper to no avail. On top of this, one of the pens started to leak after being used only a few times. The instruction book the kit comes with is not worth being discussed. I'll just say that you will need to buy another book that shows how to write the letters."
1,don't bother with this set,"the deal looks great and they do seem nice. the caps cracked and the nibs broke. serious quality control. out of 3 sets all had problemsto bad , looks nice"
1,Disappointed,"I received this product and I was so excited until I opened the tin box. About half of the ink cartridges has leaked all over. The seller doesn't offer shipping out another so I had to just send back for a refund (which I haven't gotten yet - but I'm sure I will). I didn't dare order another for fear it would happen again. Like I said, I was excited to get the product and disappointed when I did. I ordered a calligraphy pad and instruction book also (different sellers) and now I don't even have pens to use them with. I will definitely do more research before I order another calligraphy set. Granted, this may be a fluke so check the other reviews to see if this happened to others. Good luck"
1,Terrible and frustrating!,"This set is terrible! I was enthusiastically beginning calligraphy, and became quickly frustrated and discouraged, as these pens do not work!! The ink will not flow, and no writing can be accomplished. I waited half an hour for the flow of ink to begin, to no avail! I tried all of the nibs, with the same result. Not a good start. [...]"
1,Cheap price...VERY cheap quality,"I bought a set and a Schaeffer set for my classroom. The students can use them when they have finished their work. Two nibs quickly broke, and none of the students have been able to use them and get positive results. The Scheaffer set is a few more dollars, but significantly better quality. If a beginner tries to start with these pens, the person is likely to quit and believe that using a calligraphy pen is too difficult. Now the students refuse to use these pens, and wait until one of the Schaeffer pens is available. Don't waste your money as I did."
1,Don't waste your money,"It's been a while since I've done calligraphy and wanted some new pens. I decided on this set because it came with a lot and I'm addressing wedding invitations. The Sheaffer pens that I bought are much better quality. The tip of the pen doesn't make a nice thin line and I was very disappointed. I haven't tried the chunky tips yet, but the fine tips are junk. Don't waste your money. If you are looking for a cheap set go with Sheaffer instead."
1,Do not buy this pen set,"Found this set online, saw the bad reviews but bought it regardless because I thought it was cheap so it couldn't hurt.The pen set is terrible, the main pen will not write for more than one or two strokes at a time without vigourously shaking, and even this may not work every time (although it does succeed in expelling ink anywhere other than where you want it on the page. Tried using the second smallest pen instead and it was a little more consistent but the ink runs so much that it is pracitcally unusable. Looking at my attempt at the moment, the ink ran so that it was perhaps three times as thick as when I initially wrote it on the page thus merging all my lines together into one unreadable mess.In short, DO NOT BUY THIS PEN SET. It isn't worth the price no matter how much they reduce it.PS, In response to one of the few 5 star reviews on here, I am also a beginner an I think it is terrible."
1,calligraphy without words,the staedtler comes in a nice metal box and thats why its has one star .the pens simply do not flow ink.this gift was for christmas and they have worked every angle to get flowing ink.the directions are easy to follow but simply the pens fail for words.thomas jefferson would have written no discerned paper
1,Find a different calligraphy set,"In short, this is not a good calligraphy set. The pens are cheap plastic, and the nibs are extremely runny, so as soon as you touch the pen to paper you'll get a pool of ink where you wanted precise calligraphy.Don't buy this set."
1,"Bad delivery, bad customer service","Originally when I purchased 2 sets of calligraphy pens, one arrived in perfect condition, the other had exploded in an inky tsunami somewhere along the line. I posted my comments on Amazon, and the next day, [...], refunded me my money for the broken ink set and also gave me a 25 dollar coupon to use (which is super cool). However, in addition to these great things, they asked politely that I remove my scathing comments from Amazon.com.So, I go to use the coupon and after a couple days, they cancel my order and give me nothing. These people suck and will rip you off."
2,Staedtler Calligraphy Pens are Unreliable at best,"I enjoy using calligraphy pens for day to day tasks and use them as the sole writing instrument for my work, so I've grown accustomed to writing with good and bad calligraphy pens. The Staedtler's are very much the latter. Out of the three in the set sold here, only one wrote with any stable fluidity. One of the two remaining came with a nib which wasn't flexible enough to let ink out, and the other came with a faulty ink drain, which caused ink to come out all over my hands. I had another Staedtler a year or two ago which had the same nib problem, which means that Staedtler just isn't fixing the problem."
3,A large variety of nibs and ink but not a lot of instruction.,"If you're looking for a set for beginners, this one will do the job but it's nothing special. The plastic pen casings and ink are made from cheap, inexpensive materials and the enclosed booklet and instruction sheet isn't very detailed. You can find better information online. You'll be using your own paper too as they don't provide much in the way of practice sheets. It is a large variety of colors and nibs for a low cost so keep that in mind when comparing this set to others on the market, though it may be a bit of over kill. Anyone who starts with this set will quickly advance to a higher level and will want to invest in better tools anyway."
4,bought for artist bro in law,He said he is always needing to sign a piece of his work and the fineness of these pens work good. Nice variety of jibs etc. Would like to try it myself!
2,Poor ink flow and quality of nibs,"Beginner or not, this is not a good set. It does come with all of the supplies a beginner set should have but the ink flow is erratic. I have tried several nibs. The ink flow is better with the larger nibs but this is not always convenient for writing, especially if you are trying to address envelopes or write letters, notes, etc. Despite the larger nibs having better flow but the ink flow is still not smooth and you may have to go back to complete flourishes, etc. I think there are better beginner pens like Shaeffer. I think even as a beginner having a good pen is important if you are practicing your writing, trying to learn different styles, and mastering flourishes, etc. Poor ink flow and harsh nibs will be frustrating even to a beginner. If you are just using this for non-calligraphy purposes and just regular handwriting/cursive, it might be okay."
1,Save time throw it against the wall,This is the worse product called a calligraphy pen I've ever tried to use. It's terrible the ink doesn't come out except inside the pen and try to remove the cartridge be sure to wear a plastic sheet or raincoat. Drop the pen and the plastic cracks awful awful doesn't even rate . It rates my fury tried to use it all week nothing and the cartridge's are new.
4,PENS!,This is the perfect starter kit to learn Calligraphy. I gave this to my wife as a present and she loves it.
5,awesome,"Roy Rogers was a hero to me asa child, young adult and even now as an old adult. To be able to own a collectionof his music like this is beyond words. The music is a very good representation of his career in the movies. Thetribute to him by Dusty is something every parent would be proud of."
3,"Overall, a good set","Overall, a good set.A couple of caveats: - These are radio transcriptions, with really bad acting between the songs. - Some of the key songs are not performed in full. - Some of the songs have topical verses added ('Get Along Little Dogies' with a verse that the cattle would become meat for the soldiers!) - The swing orchestra on many of the songs is rather strange; but some selections have guitar. - Interesting to hear the aggressive commercials for tie-in merchandise (nothing new under the sun!) - Booklet is printed on dark paper in tiny type.Still a good set."
5,new world order,move over Robert Fisk and Anthony Beever. One of the most chilling investigative books of the last decade. A must for anyone who wishes to larn about the all-encompassing might of the New World Order.
1,Can not find a copy in english,Can not find a copy in enlish. The only way I have been reading this book is to type it and then put into my translation software. That is getting old...
4,The French Esquivel,"Wacky, Wacky, Wacky French Cha Cha Cha. I can't get enough! One or two weak tracks, including an ill-advised remix of one track, but the rest is just great. Perfect spouse-annoying music."
4,My wife likes it!!,"Interesting tunes, some of which were from a sound track of the X-Files staring Burt Renyolds.One track uses some 4 letter words."
4,Maximize the Learning,"I love incorporating the music included into these lessons to help maximize preschoolers' learning experience. These interactive lessons are user-friendly as they walk a teacher through how to teach 13 parables of Jesus in a way that includes music, games, crafts, and activities to help cement these Bible truths into the hearts of little ones."
5,What an Impact!,This is a beautiful series that depict 3 hard-working ranchers. It left such an impact on me and my family and I have shared this series with several friends. It makes me appreciate all the ranchers and farmers who work hard to make a living and they are the true unsung hero's of our time and the some of the finest examples of an American you will ever find. I heartily recommend this series to anyone and it will tug on your heart-strings.God bless our cowboys!
5,This Is Our History; This Is Our Future,"This movie depicts ""how it is, how it happens"". The beef in the supermarket had to come from somewhere,this film tells it all. Excellent contribution to our American Dream. These American Cowboys have a work ethic we should all engage in. Beautiful scenery, wonderful, heartwarming story about a forgotten lifestyle."
2,Last American Cowboy,"I was disapointed. It said season 2, but it was the same dvd that we already had. It also arrived damaged and I had to return it."
3,PPC 2002,"Well, this book describes the Pocket PC 2002 OS, whereas I am using a Toshiba PPC e355 with a PPC 2003 OS."
1,Broke on first try.,Need I add me? It broke on first try. It tried to suck and I guess it just got burnt out.
3,The Nekkid Album,"You've all heard of this one. John & Yoko go steady. An album like no other. The cover itself was a scandal. EMI wouldn't touch it. The album, in turn, was released by Tetragammaton in the US and Track in the UK. It is mainly improvised, with mellotron samples and Yoko's trademark writhing! It's almost like ""Revolution 9"" without the clips.This is more of a guilty pleasure than a benchmark. Most people wouldn't play this in broad daylight! Avant-garde is still lost on most people today. Fans to this day still see Yoko as an oddball and homewrecker, and this album as a turning point to the John Lennon everyone thought they knew."
3,Not good but every Lennon fan should hear it at least once.,"This album is infamous for it's cover no for the music on it (and I use the term 'music' loosely), but I feel that every John Lennon fan should hear this album at least once. Not because there is any must hear music on this album (which there definitely isn't), but because (good or bad) it's a part of Lennon's legacy."
3,it's ok,The cover picture is wacky but is something that did not surprise me from Lennon. The music on the other hand is another story.
3,Well it is John Lennon afterall,"We (meaning us older folks) all know about the front cover of John and Yoko in their birthday suits. The so called muzak under that infamous LP cover pic is...well...ah ah not for everyone. I have had the LP for many years but only played it once or twice. I found this hard to find cassette (allthough not the original) here on Amazon and was happy to snatch it up for my Beatles collection. I gave it a three star just because it is John, otherwise it is a one star album of recorded material that most will not like. I sure do miss John. It's been 28 years since we lost him. I often wondered how many more great albums we missed out on from him. RIP John & George."
4,very informitive,This is a very good primer. It's just a little old fashioned for todays new materials and technology..but a good place to start...
5,The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible,Great book! Don't think the recommended books that they say are often bought with this one should be bought but the book is very good and well written.
4,Back woods hand me down,"I'd buy this book again given the chance. It's an all around good primer to brewing. Lots of recipies. However the book leaves any sort of CLEAR detail out only giving you basic and I mean basic instruction. Perpahs I need a little more hand holding. And I think there are three editing erros in here. But yeah, buy it!"
2,Not as good as the reviews would lead you to believe,"I bought this book largely because of all the positive reviews but found the book to be pretty poor as far as information on the mashing, fermentation, and distillation process. If you want a basic book that talks about these topics at a VERY basic level, this book may be what you want. If you want a book that has detailed information on the subjects, then pass on it."
4,A lot of information!!,"I'm impressed with the info this book has in it. I bought it for making wine... I haven't gotten a chance to try the recipes yet, but look forward to it in the near future."
2,"Interesting information, horrible editing.","This book is in its 6th printing, yet misspellings, misplaced words, and lack of punctuation abound. I'd love to give this book a good rating for content, but the absolute abundance of errors that any competent editor should find had me cringing on almost every page.The chapters contain a lot of interesting information, particularly for the new brewer, but it's hard to get around how poorly edited this book is."
2,Keep on surfing,"Easy style reading. The illustration were too easy - mostly worthless. It seems the author tip-toes up to the useable info then stops. Maybe he is complying with some ""bootleg"" law. I found more info on the web. Nothing to see here .. move on."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"This book is full of information, but not what it sounds like when reading the review. It has some recipes for beer and wine, but the one I tried failed. If you wish to build a still this is the book for you. But if you wish to make simple wines and drinks, this is not what you want."
2,Bot quite crap,"I bought this book in part beause of reviews that I read online. This book can decide if it wants to be a very broad overview of distilling and brewing, or if it wants to get into detail. The style is fun, but if you don't have ADD you will not be able to follow it. The are some simple and glaring errors in the text which makes me suspicious of the other information presented. If you get a chance to read it for free then go for it. Just don't pay for this book."
4,"Ask for it as a gift, worth having but not buying.",All of the information in the book is available around the internet with a basic Google search. This is a book that leaves me with the impression that the author did his own editing and publishing.
4,Informative,This is an excellent book that's loaded with everything you need to know about making your own alcohol. Included recipes and lots of plans for building a still. My only problem with this book was that he wouldn't give any info on making vodka because he thinks it's evil but whiskey and moonshine are fine. That seemed pretty retarded to me.
5,The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible,"This book was not only informative, but entertaining and easy to read. Leon W. Kania is humorous and goes about his homebrewing with a practical outlook. Very well written and I am glad I bought it."
5,buy this book and get started brewing,everything you need to know to get started is right here. the tools and the ambition are up to you. the book is written in a very personal style and filled with lots of stories both personal and secondhand. recipies are great and simple. listen to this man's warnings he has a wealth of knowledge and experiences both good and bad. don't miss his whale photo on the first page.
5,Just Buy It,"Without a doubt this book is the best book to have for anyone making homemade alcoholic drinks. This book has some history, a lot of humor and tons of recipes. You get recipes for wines and more wines, beers and more beers, hopless beer, corn beer,and of course moonshine. Instructions are clear and many alternatives to expensive homebrew store items are given."
3,"Interesting. Funny, but not real informative.","I was really looking for a how-to book for making whiskey, and this book tells you how to make wine from Anything. Fine if that's what you want to learn about, but it's not quite my thing. Good book though, and he has a wonderful sense of humor."
3,No better than any other home winemaking book,"'Bible' conjures up images of encylpaedic books that cover everything, not a thin paperback that has no more information than any other home winemaking book. Points for good do-it-yourself equipment ideas, but most of the recipies are not worth drinking."
3,"Good, but not their best effort","I'm a huge Brando's fan, but Nowhere Zone just didn't do it for me. They sound more tired and worn out from their long fight to survive in the music industry. Maybe that's why they took a break after this album (which looks like it will end in 2007 with a long awaited new disc)If you like the Brando's fan it's a must buy. If you're looking for a first Brando's album to buy, save this one for later."
3,Really good second tier 60's UK pop-psych band,"This band was another one of those underground UK 60's psych pop bands that had a lot of talent, but never really ""made it"". Like The Creation, Turquoise, The Action, Orange Bicycle,(and many others), these guys were in that Kinks/Beatles/Move UK invasion style. They do it very well, and even show off some primitive Beach Boys style harmonies. It is kind of a shame that they were never given the opportunity to record a proper album, because I think that it could have been a real masterpiece. Instead this album sounds exactly like what it is, a collection of demos put together by the record label at the time because they didn't want to invest the money in recording sessions for the band. Even so, the songs are really strong, and this stands up really well alongside other UK underground releases of the time."
2,Bad Mastering,"This re-issue is no replacement for the old See For Miles version. Rev-Ola's mastered this album too loud, resulting in actual digital distortion. The announcement at the beginning of the record is actually painful to listen to. The See For Miles version doesn't have this problem, as it was mastered by someone who knew what he was doing. Also, Rev-Ola carelessly reversed the left and right channels."
5,Very good starter curl Bar,"This is an awesome bar. Very sturdy, relatively light and good grip.It has that factory smell, but it goes away after 2 days and its not strong. One problem was that it no longer comes with the spring collars(The stuff to keep the weights on at the ends). According to past reviews it used to come with them, but not anymore.I didn't know until I got the package and had to wait another few days before I could use them. Just order 1in spring collars, they are about 6 dollars.Long Story short. This is a very good curl bar."
5,Champion Barbell,"Champion Barbell added to my home-gym is a real deal. Its finishing is amazing, I'v got more than what I was expecting in such a good price. Service is prompt and I highly recommend other people to buy this."
1,not for olympic weights!,"I have only used olympic weights for working out, this bar width is about the width of a quarter, so obviously not for olympic weights."
4,Great,Since we just returned fro southwest France I wanted to find some receipes to make our favorite foods. The Cooking of Southwest France did just that. Great receipes and simple to make.
5,Good item,"Nice heavy duty item, lots of mounting holes so you can set it to the correct hight for your truck. I would highly reccomend."
1,Organize what?,I purchased 2 and both ripped when I tried to open the zipper on the day I got them! Buyer beware......
3,Interesting Covert Misson of A Forgotten War!,"I actually felt it was between 3 and 4 stars. I knew of this misson but never knew the details until now. I would personally like to thank Mrs. Clark for volunteering her husband's personal account of the misson which was in a safe-deposit box, unbeknown to the outside world.It was amazing how one Navy officer and two Korean oficers had to get everything together and ready for the invasion of Inchon. Would you believe they had only two weeks to complete the task. One just does not know how many details and how many bumps there were until they read this book. I really enjoyed the descriptions and details. I feel I have gotten to understand the Korean people better because of this book. I fellt like I was there. A job well done!"
5,STUNNING!,"What can you say? Some of the greatest music ever recorded. Put together with NUGGETS, this will provide hours of essential listening.The only fault I could find is that this could've been a 10-disc set."
3,mistake,"i got this cd because i thought it was electronic music but it is heavy metal, its not bad but i was suprised to hear guitars. there seems to be a mix up as two groups have the same name"
4,ADCO tire cover,"Bought this white tire cover for our new travel trailer in April. Looks great, good fit and good quality. After two months it started to yellow around the edges, tried to clean it up but it would not whiten up again. At first I thought it was just the sun. Talked to the RV dealer ship where we store our trailer and was told that the black rubber tire (where it contacts the white cover) is causing the yellowing of. He said you need to first cover the tire with a large plastic trash bag, then put the tire cover on. He was right....the yellowing only was present where the cover contacted the rubber of the tire, the center part is still as white as the day we put it on. Wish I had known that three months ago!"
5,Teacher's Messages for Report Cards Eng/Spn,"As a teacher dealing with Spanish speaking parents, I found this book so helpful because it provides accurate translations of comments from English to Spanish. It provides plenty of examples for conveying my students matters of interest to the parents in simple objective language."
4,good product,good product that fit my stove top perfectly and priced right. I would recommend to anyone looking to buy them also
3,Entertaining Documentary,"I enjoyed this documentary because the storyteller stays focused on the story: these 21st century hot-rodders and their dedication to original parts, authentic period hot rod styling and epic cross-country road trips. The photography is a little iffy early on with some really dirty lenses, but it improves as the movie goes on. The interviews are interesting and informative if not that entertaining.The coolest cars. Descent music. Fun story."
1,The road to Bonneville,"Not what I expected. Background music way too loud, and not my style. I wathced 5-10 minutes and shut it off. I wish I could return it, but my poor judgement doesn't justify a return. You might like it, this is only my opinion."
3,A Reasonable Good Book,"This book was a good read, but there were also disappointments. Myself, living in Kansas, I felt the reader was some how putting Kansas down, from the boy's point of view. I suppose I don't really like what it was like back then, but, as a Kansas citizen, I am proud to live here in the vast prairies, and flat lands. To me, it seemed like Thomas' father only wanted him to come live with him, because he needed another farm hand around the place. In this short story, two young children also die. Thomas' half baby brother, from whooping cough, and a neighbor girl, who was only three, and got lost on the prairie. I guess in this day and age, we don't like to think about the bad things in life, and are not use to it when it comes to reading stories.Otherwise, it was a good book, and you do learn a lot about the Kansas prairie."
4,Lat Rope,Good heavy duty gym quality material. I ran a gym for several years and this is the same stuff you will find when working out in a worlds gym or golds gym.
3,Samuari not Battle Cat,I ordered Battle cat and recieved Samuari Battle cat which I returned and received a replacement to only find out it was another Samuari! Before you order make sure it's what it says it is!!!!
1,Don't Buy It!,Todd Macfarlaine Crap!Garbagge P00r representation of what MOTU Once was. Stick to The Classics and if your picky about the Card go with Commemorative.
4,KING OF THE GHETTO,THIS IS BASICALLY LIKE A MIXTAPE [NO DJ] OLDER RO SONGS ON ONE CD WITH OTHER ARTISTS TO. DEF DON'T SLEEP IT IS WORTH HAVING
4,Don't Sleep,"This is one tight cd. Z-ro's beats and lyrics are off the chain. If you don't have it, get it!"
1,"Not about interesting women in Paris, only about the author","This book was a disappointment. I bought it because I wanted to read about all the interesting women it claims to be about: Nancy Mitford, Ninon, many others. But it is not about them. It is about the author. Once in awhile she thinks about one of these women, and gives you her thoughts. But she doesn't tell you much about the women. You are left still wanting to know the lives and loves of the famous women of Paris. This book is for people who really want to know what the author thinks about Paris, but I don't know her and I'm not interested in what she thinks, nor when she feels tired, when she wants to lie down, what she eats, when she travels on the Metro, what she says to her friends. I wanted to read about what the charming and fascinating women of Paris said and thought.`"
3,Not what I expected,"I love the music and the performer. However, this CD was originally owned by a public library, While a label was placed to state it used to be a library asset and is not any longer, the quality of sound was sub-par compared to other new or used CDs that I purchased."
5,Phenomenal,I could not put this book down when I first started reading it. It is inspiring and shows you what can be accomplished when you use your potential
4,Adorable and fun,"Part etiquette manual, part People Magazine, this is an original and funny piece of fluff. There are many biographies of Jackie available but this is different and quite charming. You may not be able to take this quick read seriously, but you can certainly smile often as you flip through the pages."
4,Wither Camelot?,"First tule: don't take this all too seriously. The title should tell us something: irreverence is in order. From the offence taken in some of the reviews I suggest a visit to the dictionary. Look up irony, and effacing humor. The best way to enjoy this book is smorgasbord style. If the gossip offends, skip to great tips for decorating your mantle (carefully cut birch twigs in oversized ginger jars? why didn't we all think of this?).Jackie hovers on the periphery, she left her mark, and we all wonder if we measure up. I found the book lots of fun, and, sometimes quite useful."
1,This book is a joke.,"This book is nothing but gossip-fueled speculation and is insulting not only to Jackie but to anyone who truly admired her. The, ahem, ""authors,"" claiming to know what her modis operandi would have been in any given situation, are sadly mistaken and deserve to be right where they are in life - writing about other peoples' greatness, although not very well."
2,What Would Jackie Do?,"When I was in high school and college whenever I had to make a decision about an important outfit or accessory I would ask myself if Jackie Kennedy woud buy it. If the answer was no, I almost always put it back.With this in mind, I was delighted when I saw this book at my local store. What Would Jackie Do? Well, I can tell you, as a confirmed Jackiephile that she probably would be appalled by this book. It's mostly mean gossip (at times it reads like the authors are Kitty Kelly wannabees) and it dwells less on Her Elegance's style choices so much as her relationships with enemies, lovers and employees. There is nothing new here and I thought that the Jackie Handbook or In the Kennedy Style or 1000 Days of Magic would be much better buys. This book is supposed to be tribute to Jackie but it comes off just like two school girls telling tales about a more talented, charming, and clever classmate. Bah!"
2,Pretentious Fluff Jackie would have abhorred this book,"I do not recommend this book. None of the so-called tips are even relevant to regular people and only apply to Jackie. In my opinion the authors did not cast her in a favorable light and this book only serves to make her appear spoiled and a snob, which from what I have read about her in other books, I know is not how she was.Also, it is one thing to admire her and take inspiration from her life, but it is not acceptable to try and BE her. No one can be like her and this book gives the impression that you could clone yourself into being another Jackie. Be yourself and do not aspire to be something you are not. That is exactly what Jackie would do, be herself, and she certainly would not reduce herself to read a book on how to be some other woman."
1,Dissappointed read,"If you are a Jackie fan, i suggest you not to read this book. The book portrays her as a spoiled and phony person, who just happens to be rich, powerful and very tactful. My personal ""favorite"" Jackie story from this book is about how she wrote a ""heartfelt"" thank you letter to the person gifted her a beautiful cake that she ""enjoy it very much"", and turns around to instructed secret service to ""destroy it""! HOW CLASSY!"
1,what would jackie do,"i read a glowing review of this book in the wall street journel and bought two books as gifts for my 19 year old daughters. i read half of the book and decided there was no way i could give this book to any one that i loved and respected. these women are cashing in on a name and praying on young women who have no clue who jackie kennedy was. i am sure there are people out there that will buy in to the cleaver, breezy style. in fact this book was one big back-handed ""compliment."""
1,"Chatty, Gossipy Manual is Right! Horrible.","The reviewers from Publishers Weekly have it right when they say that this book is a ""chatty, gossipy manual."" It depicts Jackie O. as a rich party girl with nothing more than dinner party arrangements to worry her pretty little head. What an insult to intelligent, ambitious, modern women everywhere (and to Jackie O. too I suspect)! Best save your money on this one, and, for a real study of true elegance and grace, read about Eleanor Roosevelt."
1,Susan Z,"I found this book to be a total waste of time. A selection for my book club, it warranted only about 5 minutes of discussion. While Jackie O was facinating, this book was boring and totally lacked substance. With so many other fine books available I could not waste my time finishing What Would Jackie Do?"
1,it doesn't have a copyright,I know this seems a little OCD but I was looking up some things at the patent office and also at the US copyright office and this book does not have a copyright.odd.
3,"Light, easy read.","This book contains some cute ""Jackie-inspired"" suggestions for life, from clothing choices to strategies for handling those people who deserve a ""PBO"" (polite brush-off). At times I felt the suggestions were a stretch. The authors did consult Jackie's friends and colleagues, but other sources were quoted as merely speculating on what Jackie would do in a given situation, leaving me the reader questioning the usefulness or validity of their statements. However, overall, it was a light and entertaining little book. It was a palatable and brief guide to life, if one aspires to live like Jackie O. It was at times humorous and candid. Rather than blindly idolizing Jackie O, the authors remained honest about not only her most admired traits but also her flaws such as marrying for money or the occasional skipping of important functions for a trip to the ballet."
4,Visual Studio Tools for Office 2003 Upgrade,"The product installed easily following the instructions provided, the documentation is typical Microsoft, and to date the specific features I purchased the upgrade for - the MS Access Development Tools - have worked quite well. I'm more than satisfied with the upgrade.Matt"
2,a new bellini opera complete with sound effects,"I bought this recording because it featured my favorite lovely soprano, Katia Ricciarelli and it was at the time, her latest offering on CD. Unfortunately, it was not her best effort. In fact, her beautiful voice seemed off pitch at times, (particularly at the end of act one) and sounded labored throughout the opera. And this was not helped by the distracting sound effects in the background, like mousetraps snapping off and on from under the seats in the opera house; or at least that is what is sounded like, and some idiot turned on a vacuum cleaner backstage during the dying scene, then quickly turned it off when it was apparently noticed by someone. Overall, a disappointing set, best avoided by true Katia Ricciarelli fans like myself."
4,Enjoyable Bellini,"Zaira, an early Bellini opera is pleasant enough; it's not Norma but at this early stage it's an opera I found entertaining. All the singers are great and some of the music is very moving. There's a cabaletta in Zaire that Bellini used again for the Act 1 closing of Norma. If you like Bellini, by all means buy this recording. The sound is excellent as well."
3,Music Doesn't Seem Like OPriginal,"The music opn this CD does not sound like the original music from the movie. Maybe due to the remastered? Anyway, I'm not crazy about the CD, although I loved the original music from the movie."
5,Patrick Swazye,Dirty Dancing arrived on time and in excellent condition. I enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend this sound track for all Patick Swazye fans. But it's a must have for anyone that liked Dirty Dancing.
5,Dirty Dancing 20 yr Anniversary,I love this CD! takes you right back to the movie and the wonderful music!
2,"Good Info, Poor Writing","The subject matter of this book is fascinating, but it is so poorly written (bad grammar, repetitive) that it's hard to read."
1,Waste of money!,"This pen set was a complete waste of my money. I tried everything, but could never get ink to come out! This was not my first set...I know how to use this type of pen; it just would not write at all. Ended up throwing it away in angry frustration. Seemed too much of a hassle to return it. I would give zero stars if that was an option!"
2,Calligraphers be warned!,"Don't buy this pen if you want to write in Calligraphy. The nibs on this pen are blunt and do NOT produce a sharp, clean script. It doesn't matter what kind of paper I used, the ink flow and nib produced rounded letters much like you'd get with a regular sharpie felt pen. VERY disappointed in this product. The nibs are supposed to be chisel tip but do not produce a sharp edge at all."
5,Feng Shui That Fits My Lifestyle,"Gemstone Feng Shui -- what a great combination!I feel that I finally understand and can use feng shui. The information in this book is straightforward and fits my lifestyle. Anyone interested in feng shui or crystals (and of course both) will find this book a ""must have""."
5,Feng Shui for Pagans,"At last, a way to use feng shui that works from a pagan perspective and belief. Thank you."
1,Put stones around your house for the ultimate in harmony!,"Now, I can get into some feng shui and I can see how a certain flow to your house is important. I can accept things like ""don't put your bed on the same wall as the door"", but that is a far cry from this book. Putting different color rocks in different places around the house will not help you and you might want to take a trip to the shrink if you think otherwise. If you still believe in the power of rocks--LOL--after you get back from the shrink, then this is the book for you! Buy it now!"
3,Interesting CD,"Some years ago I discovered that what I thought (when I first heard them) were original Elvis songs were anything but. In fact, pretty much all of his earliest material was recorded before by someone else. Of course this was a time of 'cover' songs by everybody. No stations played the original black artists versions (at least not where I lived) so it was quite surprising to find ""the originals"" years later. I started to collect some of the originals and compare them to Elvis' versions. Surprising how true Elvis stayed to the original styles. This CD covers not only some of Elvis early covers but some of his later ones as well. If you love the history of music this is a good CD to own.BONUS: This is the only CD I have ever found that includes Darrell Glenn's version of 'Crying In the Chapel'. I had found it previously only on vinyl."
3,It works,Fast delivery and excellent customer service. I ordered two and neither worked upon arrival. I kind of felt as though I wasn't believed by the gal I emailed because she said that had never happened where two items were defective. despite that I had prompt service to exchange with the prior company. The item is alright although I thought it would be a little better quality. I may be just a little critical.
1,Huge Mistake,"I thought this would clean up scratches, its just a wet and dry system, does nothing for scratches but if your extremely lazy, and I'm not talking kind of lazy I mean you wouldn't even breathe for your self if you didnt have to, then this is for you."
1,All this does is wipe dust off your disk,"I thought this would repair disk similar to the skip doctor, not so, this just washes your disks, nothing you couldn't do with a soft cloth yourself."
2,Meh,"This review is NOT for a GoFit rope, as the seller sold me a different brand of rope than advertised. In my exp, the GoFit leather rope is heavy, durable and robust. This rope is too light and if you jump rope you know that a light rope is hard to jump because it's hard to keep it moving. Plus after a few weeks of use it's very wore in the spot the hits the ground. It's not going to last. I don't think I'll buy another jump rope sight-unseen. I broke my GoFit leather rope when it hit the metal track to my garage door. I need to fin another actual GoFit rope."
1,Synopisis of the N Amer Lichens,Be careful here. This is a reprint of a stultifying treatise written in 1882. It is for the serious professional or student only and then useful only for historical purposes.
2,"An ""Art Book""","This is ultimately a disappointing collection, in part because the editors thought they were putting together a photographic art book rather than an historical photo archive. Some of the photos would be of historical or technical interest had they been reproduced close to the full size of the page. Instead, we have a pretentious, ""minimalist"" layout with tiny photos lost in the middle of huge white spaces (perhaps suggesting a gallery wall or some such nonsense). Captions contain little contextual information, and several are wrong in identifying the equipment shown. As an historical document this volume has little to offer. Even as a coffee table art book, it is bland, because these are for the most part just mediocre snapshots."
2,Not Worth the Price,"This is to agree with a previous reviewer, regarding the poor value of this book for anyone who cares about the correctness of the information presented. The impression I got from this book was that whoever put this together wanted a quick way to bank on the recent surge in interest in everything WW2. The photos here are in most part minimally presented, but still allowing in numerous mistakes.If you don't pay the list price you may still feel ok about it, since the photos are indeed not seen before."
4,Authentic Soul of Spain,This album is truly exciting. It has all the soul and essence that is Flamenco. All the passion that this dance has to offer can be heard in every song. I highly recommend it.
4,A funky party platter,"The record is a very creative and interesting experiment in sampling. The samples, fortunately, happen to be funky as anything because they belong to the maestro, Quincy Jones. It's nice to see a well-thought out remix album and from someone like Quincy Jones, you would expect Timbaland, the Neptunes, Ludacris, and every other big-name medium talent producer of the day to be on here. Refreshingly, Q chose some producers that really seem to be MUSICIANS as well (a concept unheard of nowadays) and the results are fantastic. There's actually LIVE playing on this. The Chakadoons tracks has a great groovy 60's style breakdown complete with guitar, hammond, and percussion. Soulive's track has real guitar and Hammond and some of the others feature real instrumentation as well.You can toss this on at a party and not worry about running to the changer every 5 minutes to skip the wack song, as the funk runs all the way through."
4,Excellent,"Unless you have sworn off all syncopation in your life, it is impossible not to love theThe Original Jam Sessions 1969. This was the music for a show where Bill Cosby played a gym teacher. Jones used some of his best jazz musicians to make some of his best funk. If you are looking at this remix album, I highly suggest you visit its source material.But this remix is no slouch itself. It is no substitute for the 1969 music, but is not meant as such. But the New Mixes-with artists like Cornershop and Ursula 2000--is rare in that the modern beats don't kill the music there grafted to. This album goes in all directions: funk eastern, jungle, and while you don't get the feel of this music in '69, many of the great Jones' beats and melodies are detectable.Definitely get the original sessions, but also grab this for its creativity."
3,good enough,"Good enough, but if you have already done kaplan and Goljan, you will find very little new things here. Still a fair review."
5,the best book for the international MD student,great book - i used it a lot and it has all the guidance that you need. It is also very compatible with the Kaplan questions bank and very easy to read in conjugation with the Kaplan Medical.it is really up to date and has excellent graphics.I warmly recommend it
5,a must for an IMG!!,"As an IMG i was so scared from theAmerican examWell apparently it is nothing amazing,give your self 2 weeks to read this book thouroughly and you'll pass for sure!!!to beat the mean or not will depend on your knowledge aquired in your Med School!!!Good luck!!"
5,Best review book out there,"This is the best, most important review book for step 1. It obviously does not cover everything. You'll need to supplement with other review books. But this should be the foundation of your studying. Tip: you can save a lot of money by buying an older edition used. The newest information included in the latest editions most likely won't increase your step score."
4,Good review,"I only used the Microbiology part : it's a little outdated, especially concerning antibiotic resistance and different E.coli strains, but other than that it's a really useful review, with some good mneumonics. It helped me to see the essential information about each bug and virus, preparing me for the clinical situations described in test questions."
1,Garbage!,"Another garbage effort from the christan right..According to these imbeciles,unless you are praying in THIER church you are flirting with the""devil""..according to these imbeciles any group that doesn't salute thier ""god"" or thier messiah is ""satanic""..oh,yes,they go on and on and on about how tarot cards, ouija boards and the like are""tools of the devil"" and all of that other fear-mongering flap-doodle ..Viewing this program is an experience in ignorance,from start to finish..If these people had thier way everyone would worship thier way only,OR be burnt at the stake...Garbage,with a very large ""G"" !"
2,to many missstakes,"I am having issues with this book. There are too many mistakes in it - most of them of an editorial nature, but in a programming book it's the little things that count. In addition, the structure could be better and there are many terms that are not well explained and conversely some lucid yet pointless explanations. I began learning VBA about 4 years ago and am proficient in VBA for Excel applications, so in many respects i am not a beginner to this stuff. I just want to build up my Access VBA knowledge but i think i'll be buying a different book. The only good thing is that i got this book cheap through Amazon."
2,Not firm enough. Not for crossfit,I've used foam rollers at various gyms and thought this would be nice to have at home. I just received it and it's already heading back via UPS. It's just not firm enough for me and is not what you find in professional gyms. I'm a crossfitter and want something firm. I'm going with Nimbus Endurabead products instead of this.
1,Much Improved/New Model-5 STARS,"I am on my second one in six months.Bought it at Sports Authority.I am 150 pounds.I am an every day user and it just does not hold up.Loses it roundness quickly and then degeneratesfrom there.I will be returning this oneDVD is very goodand buying a much better quality one for muchless money.There are few good ones on the inetrnet but the cheapest one ($8.99) is STILL of far better quality than this one.My yoga studio has the cheap one and I could not believe the difference.If you are over 100 pounds and are a daily roller, don't waste your money!!Compay sent me two new rollars free of charge.They have redesigned them and are far better thanthe old model.Thanks CP!"
1,Doesn't hold up,"Works great, until it goes flat. Mine was clearly losing its roundness after about 10 uses. I weigh about 175 pounds, and roll for about 10 minutes each time. I'm very disappointed that this one is going flat so quickly; I have a plain white roller that I bought from my local gym for about $2 more than this one, and it is still round after 8 months of daily rolling."
3,Foam lasts a few months before getting mushy,I replaced this foam roller with an Exervo Nimbus which uses compressed polyethylene beads and is MUCH more durable. These foam type rollers only last a few months before the foam breaks down and gets mushy. The Nimbus has lasted 6 months so far and still looks nearly new.
5,very good! :),found a lot of parts of my body that are aching!! even it is a nice relief for neck and head/neck junction!! my back feels so much better now!
4,Good Product,I have not watched the DVD. I read up on the procedures and it definately stretches and massages you better than you would yourself or any other amateur. I would recommend this product.
4,Good purchase....,"I really like the foam roller and I use it all the time. The only reason, why I gave 'only' 4 stars, instead of the DVD, I would have prefered a printed cheat sheet for the exercises instead."
3,Breaks Down Over Time,This foam roller will lose firmness over time. I just replaced mine with a totally different model because it simply didn't provide the necessary relief anymore. I could use it all day and it sill wouldn't work out muscle tension like the foam rollers at my gym.
3,Not the best out there,This roller lasted for a short time before it lost its firmness. I would not recommend this if you are a avid runner. There are others out there that have a harder inner core wrapped with a softer outer foam.
4,GoFit Foam Roller,"This is a smaller version of the foam rollers in my gym. It is more convenient for storage in my room, and a little softer, which is more forgiving on muscles. It's a great tool for runners and I would highly recommend it for anyone to soothe the back and tight muscles, and for core strength."
3,Fair - could be better,"After owning this roller for a few weeks of heavy use it is both concave and more or less flat in the middle. I am 6'4"", weigh 220lbs and use it every day if not twice per day. I am now in the market for a new one and it will not be the ""Go Fit"" brand. The included DVD adds some value thus raising this review to 3 stars - 2 stars sans DVD. Would probably be much better for someone of lighter weight."
2,"Ehhh, not great","Did the job for a little while, but started deforming with regular use. After a while it didn't hold up to my 150 lb frame enough to roll adhesions out of muscle fibers."
3,"Too soft, does not hold structure, too small. Fits in suitcase, though.","This product, viewed solely as a foam roller, should get 1 star only. It is too soft and loses it's shape very quickly. I also find it is not long enough for some of the rolling that I do, and thus is not quite as stable. It also starts to fall apart with regular use, getting both deformed and quite awkward. All of this said, I rated it 3 stars because of it's size... while not good in normal use, it is great for travel as it tucks neatly into most suitcases."
2,Soft and inffective,"I bought this at a target store for a throwaway price of six dollars. Even at that price I'm disappointed at it's effectiveness or rather the lack of it. It's not hard enough and ends up cushioning over those knots/tender areas that you want to emphasize while doing the body rolls. The gym I go to has harder and lighter high density foam rollers. There is a world of difference between the two. At $20, this is an utter waste of money."
5,Cant believe I am reviewing chalk lol,I purchased this for weight lifting. It works great and I am very happy I purchased it. 5 Stars! Now I just need to find a nice chalk bag to hold it :)
5,WORKS GREAT,I use this for Weight Lifting in the gym without GLOVES. No More Slipping weights after tanning...
4,Good chalk for climbing,Good price on climbing chalk. It's very soft and breaks up very easily. One block of chalk filled my bag to the brim so you will have this stuff for awhile.
4,Great for what I needed,"This is exactly what I wanted. It would be nice to have another carrying bag so chalk doesn't get everywhere, but the ziplock bag that is comes in works nicely for storing. I would recommend this product."
5,does,"does what it's supposed to do perfect chalk for lifting or anything where you'd need a good grip, even helps with keeping ur grip on a bball or fball"
5,What a lot of gym chalk,"Of all the gym chalk I've ever used, this was some of it. It was exactly as billed, gym chalk in convenient blocks. I may actually now have a lifetime supply of gym chalk."
5,More than enough,"Not much to stay about this, it's exactly what you need. I will mention that one box has a TON of chalk. Depending how much you use this, it could easily last you 6 months if not longer. If you need a lot for grip then you could probably use one block a month. For the price this can't be beat and it's quality stuff too."
5,I loved the whole series,I watched each of the programs from beginning to end. They give tremendous insight into the origins of the universe. The purchaser should also buy Season 2 to get the big picture.
3,Lip sync issues...,"Amazon videos continue to have lip sync issues, and this one was no exception. Too bad in that the show was otherwise excellent."
5,Well worth the money,"I recently started a new hobby of star gazing, and found ""Through The Wormhole"" both instructional and entertaining. Anything with Morgan Freeman is worth watching. I highly recommend the DVD to anyone at any age. The information is up to date and the graphics and visual effects are fantastic."
4,good series,i found this to be pretty interesting and learned a few things too. it great to watch when traveling too. i would recommend this.
4,Interesting and worth watching,"Interesting and worth watching is something very rare in the modern tv wasteland, but this show fills the bill. It does wonder around a little between real science and speculation, but it is always manages to keep your interest and attention. Overall, it`s a documentary that is both informative and entertaining.You could do a lot worse than this one."
4,Amazing Show but Poor Quality DVD,"The show itself is amazing and thought provoking but as a DVD, it's poor in quality. The Subtitles are automatically set on so every time you turn the show on you have to be sure to set the subtitles off. Also there are no special features and the DVD menu itself looks like something I can whip up on roxio in two seconds. However, I still love the show and can easily watch the episodes multiple times."
4,My head hurts!,"I consider myself to be a pretty bright guy, but I must admit that I've never watched anything as challenging as this show. Some of the ideas presented are wild, filled with technical explanations beyond the average person. I was amused to find most of these theories are funded in some way or another.I did enjoy the show though, and was blown away by some of the science involved."
3,Can't watch it,"I love this show, but I can't watch it. The cinematography is awful. Every 30 seconds, of every episode, they think they have to show an extreme close up of someone's face, up the nose, in the ear, the mouth. Over and over. It's gross. What idiot thought that was a good idea?Morgan Freeman is great. The science is interesting. But ugh, I can't watch."
2,Eh.,This isnt as good as I was anticipating. Its really just a lot of theories and not a lot of factual information. Its also more on the boring side.
2,Alternatives,"If you want reliable information on the subjects covered in this book I recommend: Astronomy Magazine, the free frequent NASA articles on the Internet, The Planetary Society, Carl Sagan's (the most outstanding astronomer of the 20th century now deceased) series ""Cosmos"" to name but a few.Andrew Swansonseswan2@comcast.net"
3,"Very shallow in spots,,, Perfect for,,,","Very shallow in spots ,,, maybe to entice children and females.Perfect for children and bovine. Boring for the average male ,,, nothing new ,,, old recycled data.Otherwise I found it rewarding because of their (quality production) attempt with some success to ,,, bring together ,,, the thoughts of many scientists, physicists, etc."
3,Great Science. Childish Presentation.,"I love the science topics they talk about in this show. It's an incredible and mind-boggling set of topics. Quantum physics and the Quantum implications are absolutely fascinating to me.The representations to me are a touch on the childish cartoon side. If you are seriously interested in this topic of science, maybe a different source may be better, such as ""Quantum Enigma"" by Rosenblum anf Kuttner (see link below).If maybe you are a more visual person or would prefer a less intensely-scientific representation of very deep material, this is a good show. It makes it simple enough for non-scientific people, yet is still incredible science.Also see:[...]"
3,Not as good as similar shows on NOVA,"I didn't feel like this show explained its concepts as well as similar shows on NOVA (Brian Greene's The Fabric of the Cosmos for example). Sure, Morgan Freeman's voice is great for narrating but I feel like I understood everything better when watching Brian Greene explain it. NOVA is probably the best source for watching educational TV and their series on the universe was much better in my opinion."
2,Don't trust the name!,"For a product with ""No Chip"" in the name of the product, you would expect it to last a couple days with out chipping. I can not even get one day before my nails chip. I really like this brand, but this product is a big flop!"
3,china glaze no chip top coat.,Not to impressed with it. Still chipped I used it as a top coat after applying China glaze color nail polish. Chipped after two days
1,Whoops...,"Wow, did this book miss the mark. One of my favorite lines:""Notice the value-increasing effects you have in low-yield real estate markets when cap rates are reduced from an average of 8 percent down to 5 percent.""The author then list examples to show how you ""increase value"" in expensive markets like CA by simply lowering your cap rate. Wow! The more you think about it, the funnier it gets."
5,Feels great!,"If you use tools a lot the 'feel' in your hands means a lot.This ratchet has the great feel in your hand that is the sign of a well designed tool.Considering it has a very fine tooth action just adds to the experience.It has a very good chrome finish too...When I reach for a 3/8"" ratchet I grab this one and bypass others in my tool box.Not being too expensive is a big bonus too."
5,Great informational book on health,I found this book to be of great information and resource..I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to make a change in their current lifestyle.
3,good book,this book is very good for information but some things are hard to find when you live in a small town
3,SoSo book. No suprises here.,You can find all the information in this book by searching the internet..Ok book with interesting info nontheless...Summed up info I already knew...So no complaints.I got what I expected...MJL
3,Just didn't seem as good as the others.,I really enjoyed her previous books and this one was ok. But I especially enjoy books that make me laugh at the couples antics. This book just didn't do that for me.
2,Not a favorite,"I had a hard time getting into this book. The storyline tend to drag, I couldn't get into it. But, I had to read on just to see how it ended. I like the women to be spunky...Sara didn't have any."
2,AWLFUL!!,This is the first and the last book I shall ever read from Joan Wolf. It was simply the worst romance I have ever read. No emotion. The main characters were more like subcharacters.The only reason why I gave it 2 stars was because the ending was interesting.
4,A nice unpretentious romance,"I enjoyed this book. I found both the hero and heroine to be sympathetic and I enjoyed the twist on the ""who is murdering the heroine"" plot in that she doesn't become paranoid suspecting the hero. However, to be fair the story does seem like the melding of Wolf's previous Regencies ""The American Duchess"" and hmm... I can't quite remember the name--it was Double or Duel Deception or something like that. The original novels had more sponteneity but this one retained the likability and emotional stability of the characters. In the end it is an enjoyable (though perhaps uninspired) read."
5,Definitely a Favorite,"It has every thing I like:Marriage of convenience between two interesting people who are determined to make a success of the marriage.Handsome, sexy, decent hero. (I can't stand when the hero is a jerk and treats the heroine disrepectfully).Some intrigue and interesting secondary charactersSensual love scenes. I love a tender wedding night.A gradual falling in love and HEA!"
3,charmingly sweet seduction,"The courtship is so charmingly sweet that you may fall in love; you will certainly understand why the herione did. If you tire of books where the hero and heroine spot one another across a ballroom and tumble immediately, irrevocably and often inexplicably into love, you will be seduced by Ms. Wolf's skilfull handling of the wooing. From the opening page until the wedding, Ms. Wolf writes a top notch romance. Unfortunately, after the wedding all we get is a ""who's trying to murder the heroine""-type plot with little romantic tension."
5,"Low key, but appealing romance.","I've enjoyed Joan Wolf's regencies since I was a teenager. It's hard to describe, but her writing style has an aura of calm and rationality that makes the unfolding of the romance seem inevitable. In other words, they are real and more touching than more overwrought romances. Adrian's and Sarah's romance feels like a rain soaking into a bed of rosebuds. Adrian's the aristocrat who gives off an aura of noblesse oblige; Sarah, painter and merchant's granddaughter, is obviously meant to be a duchess despite her lowly birth. A beautiful romance."
3,1970's time capsule,"This bare bones DVD is the only available version of Hal Ashby's debut film, starring Beau Bridges in one of his relatively rare leading roles as a Candide-like suburbanite who plans to evict the black tenants of a run-down Harlem building and gentrify it into his own dwelling.In the supporting cast,Lee Grant as his pseudo-liberal mother, given to promoting worthy causes, has a drunken encounter with Pearl Bailey as the house's resident den mother involving drapes and homemade liquor which is probably the high,if cliched, point of the film.The exquisite Diana Sands finds herself enmeshed with Bridges in one of his 2 interracial romances and is the recipient of his guilt-ridden largess after he has impregnated her. This largely muddy print is difficult to see at times and lacks any subtitles, commentary or other amenities. As a time capsule of early 70's racial and fashion sensibilities, the film is worth a one time only glance."
5,Diana Sands is at her Best in the Hal Ashby Classic,"It's so good to see this film on DVD finally. Hal Ashby's debut directorial effort (made possible by Norman Jewison) is a solid effort with great performances by Beua Bridges, Lou Gosset Jr., Markie Bey, Lee Grant and, most notably, the incredible Diana Sands in one of her final roles. Ahead of it's time editorially, and insigntful (for 1970) this is a grittier, hipper take on themes alluded to in ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"", but done with much more flavor, flair, and contemporary focus. Although Ashby went on to do several landmark films (i.e. ""Shampoo"", ""Being There"", ""Coming Home"") this is still my favorite. Thanks MGM!"
3,Comedy...or social statement?,"This started out as a comedy...but shortly after midpoint, became a harsh social commentary.Depends on whether you are seeking entertainment or an examination of some disturbing and thought-provoking issues."
3,"A bit confusing, but a decent movie about race.","In case you don't know what the movie is about, I'll tell you. Beau Bridges plays a man who became a landlord to a ghetto area in Brooklyn. He wants to tear it down, but changes his mind when he meets some of the locals. The movie started off really well, and then got a little confusing with the plot and the relationship between Beau's character and Lanie, who he slept with after a party and got her pregnant. There also is a lot of weird edits that just come out of nowhere, but it's a decnt movie about racism, the lower class, and freedom. It's also quite funny, espeically the part when Marge and Joyce, a white woman and a black woman, get drunk together. Decent movie"
5,Useful for novices and advanced students alike.,"Those who have not yet studied Descartes will enjoy this clearly written introduction to Descartes' life and thought. However, even seasoned philosophy students are also liable to find much of interest in Sorell's DESCARTES. For most philosophy students, Descartes is more or less synonymous with the DISCOURSE ON METHOD and the MEDITATIONS ON FIRST PHILOSOPHY, and Descartes' scientific and mathematical work tend to be regarded as almost irrelevant and disconnected afterthoughts. The brilliance of Sorell's book is to show how Descartes' work constitutes an integrated whole, where the DISCOURSE and the MEDITATIONS are more a preliminary step in Descartes' project than the endpoint of his philosophy that we often take it to be."
2,Even Jan Cornet can't salvage this turkey,"This movie is so hopelessly stupid that even lovely and talented Jan Cornet can't save it. He is the ONLY good thing about it and the only reason I gave it even two stars - but even he looks and acts dumb through most of it. The story and the dialog are ridiculous and not believable for a minute. It's not even worth the energy it would take to tell what it's about.I love Spanish movies in general, and Cornet is a lot better in Almodóvar'sThe Skin I Live In, in a much smaller role (even that movie is a disappointment, though - far from Almodóvar's peak; he should have left Banderas in Hollywood), but this movie doesn't cut it.Cornet definitely has a bright future in the movies, but García de Leániz may be better off writing and directing soap operas."
3,Biased,"While there is some good (but all too brief) information presented in this book about the U.S.-Mexican border (including some interesting history of the region) and the results of the government's implementation of Operation Gatekeeper, it is mostly an account of how left-wing Americans have reacted to the border and to the operation. Overall, I found the book to be biased toward a very liberal point of view. The lefties who break the law and stoop to immigrant smuggling are portrayed in a very sympathetic light (and their party affiliations go unnoted), while the ranchers who round up immigrants on their property at gun point (possibly also breaking the law) are portrayed as overzealous, bug-eyed gun nuts (and invariably described as Republicans).Much better (and more objective) books to read regarding this fascinating and important issue are Dead In Their Tracks, Coyotes, Crossing Over and Shadowed Lives."
4,Whimsical doll fashions,"Simply designed cheerful clothing for 12, 14, 16, 18 inch dolls. Basic sewing techniques and terms explained and illustrated for the novice seamstress. Patterns are overlapped for the different size dresses and may need to be measured and adjusted for specific commercial dolls. Very clear instructions that can be easily followed. Would be an excellent book for a child learning to sew"
4,Very Useful Book,"Really like this book - I've made about 6 of the outfits so far. The patterns are precise and quick to construct - I think of them as ""down-and-dirty methods that produce very serviceable doll clothes. You can add all the detail you like, though, to get more fancy results. A few things to keep in mind: 1) Though most of the pattern pieces are given as dimensions for squares and rectangles, you'll need to trace the pattern pieces that have irregular shapes; 2) There's nothing complicated about these patterns, but it helps to have some sewing experience. 3) Because the methods are so quick, you will end up with a lot of raw edges - I've done a bit more finishing than the book calls for. 4) These are not really BABY doll patterns because the waist measurements are pretty thin - but for the right dolls they're great."
1,Pattern Book,I'm not happy with this book at all. It doesn't have the complete patterns and the designs don't fit the dolls correctly.I don't recommend the purchase of this book.
4,worth the pickup,i thought he did alittle to much collab's on this album.. and some tracks hes not even on.. yeah i get its a mixtape.. but still just letting you folks know.. the tracks where trocks alone are very good.. the first two songs alone are catchy and cleverly written.. if your a trock fan peep it atleast for his spots.. if not to hear some of his click and some people ft...
3,dark twilight,"Another movie about the male strippers in the Philippines, Twilight Dancers is even more homoerotic than the others (Midnight and Macho). It is also a darker film, offering no hope for goodness, kindness, or right to succeed. There is an ""evil woman"" here who will make your blood run cold; and she gets all she wants. By the end she has even corrupted the young (cute) dancer who would have been the hero. The only counterbalance to the pessimism is the eroticism of the dancers, which is even ""hotter"" than in the other two ""Dancer"" films. If you can handle the extreme melodrama of Philippine movies in general, and you liked the other two, you should enjoy this one. Gay viewers should not fail to watch the extras."
3,Ang sarap ng kili-kili ni Allen Dizon!,"Chika na sana ang pelikulang ito kaso miscast si William Martinez bilang klosetang bading. Buti na lang magaling umarte si Ana Capri. Si Allen, need an acting workshop sa totoo lang..."
4,strong and sturdy,used this for Celestron SkyMaster 25X100 ASTRO Binoculars which are very heavy Binoculars.works well.
4,A good light weight tripod for spotter or camera,"I've been using this tripod with my 35mm cameras, medium format cameras (Hasselblads), ETX90 spotting scope and Orion Short Tube 80 refractor. The tripod performs well in most cases, and has a built in bubble level to help in leveling the tripod. The only shortcomings are that the pan head is difficult to adjust in small increments, so centering items in the telescopes are not as effortless as one would like. This tripod is a great platform for a 35mm camera or a medium format camera with shorter lenses. When I use my longest lenses (350mm & 500mm) on my Hasselblad, I have to take additional measures to insure that the tripod remains steady. Then again, these are probably beyond what this tripod was designed for."
4,Really nice set,"This is just an all around good set if you've got the space (it's a hulk) and a bit of cash. Very easy to set up and use, and has been a great addition to my home. If I have one gripe it's that standard definition TV looks a little murky. Everything else looks great."
5,Widely Applicable,"I found Vogler's style easily accessible and the material widely applicable. I've gifted copies to several friends in various creative endeavors, because the archetypes -- and his ideas about them -- are useful to me across a broad range of visual media. I've referred back to this book while working on photo series, graphic novels and web design projects.For the advert context, I also recommend: The Hero And The Outlaw (http://www.amazon.com/Hero-Outlaw-Building-Extraordinary-Archetypes/dp/0071364153/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1295545130&sr;=1-1)."
3,For The Specific Screenwriter,"I usually read biographies or non-fiction, so I really shouldn't be surprised that I found this book to be rather mind numbing. I'm also not into writing screenplays (fiction). There was some comparing of mythology and philosophy to ""Star Wars"" and other storytelling, and plenty discussion about story structure and patterns. But, I really found this to be tedious reading and repetitious. I can't really give it a fair review, as this topic does not interest me, but the book seems to be selling well. I'd recommend it to those who are very analytical about story telling and the basic structures. There are plenty of real-life examples here, if you are a screenwriter, teacher or just a fan of this type of pop culture."
5,Buy This Book!,"The Writer's Journey represents a fresh, new approach to screenwriting. When you write a script, you do begin a journey, and at its conclusion both you and the characters are at different places. A valuable resource for everyone's screenwriting library!"
3,A starting point,"Written down to studio executives with low IQs and short attention spans, nevertheless this book still manages to be informative.Basically cribbed entirely from Joseph Campbell's <u>Hero with a Thousand Faces</u>, this book parcels out the jargon of archetypes into easy-to-swallow tablets. It is ultimately useful on the most basic levels in creating story and character. I'd like to see the next edition better structured and written for adults... but I can't deny the value of what Vogler teaches. Beginners: You will outgrow this book quickly but that doesn't mean it isn't useful."
2,How to Go Blind Reading Vogler,"I've read Vogler before and jumped at the new edition to read the additional chapters. Besides I've loaned my other copy out. If you actually want to read this fine book buy another edition besides THIRD because the print is the smallest I have ever seen in my life. It drives you absolutely insane. Which is why I find myself posting a review on Amazon. Content, fabulous, if I could read it."
3,Mythical Journey 101 for Writers,"I would not normally pick up this type of book, but, I decided to expand my horizons. The text is easy to read and I now see how screenwriters and fantasy writers can develop their mythical storylines. Vogler makes it easy to understand how the structure in a story is built, and it is translatable to any type of storyline. For the type of book that I do not normally read I surprisingly finished it all the way to the end. I would not read another book like this again, since it is more textbook than a writer's journey like Stephen King's On Writing, I left reading textbooks for school not necessarily for fun."
1,Tried but couldn't get through it...,"Found this book to be very repetitive and extroardinarly boring. I went into it with a very open mind actually looking to learn as much as I could but truly found this to be a pretty torturous read, I felt like it was just saying the same thing Over and Over and Over and Over."
2,Too formulaic for real creativity...,"This book on scriptwriting sticks to formula, purely and simply. If you wish to write more of the same (and there's no denying that formulaic writing is certainly commercial), you might find something of value here, but this kind of thinking is just going to create more of the same kind of hack screenwriting that Hollywood is already flooded with."
1,couldnt agree with you more,"This book is a simple, straigforward, undisguised, and apparantly unashamed plagarism of Campbell's ""Hero with 1000 faces."" The difference is that Campbell, though now somewhat dated, was an intellegent, educated, and entertaining writer; Vogler has nothing unique or original to offer to a work written over fifty years ago."
1,The What Journey?,"TWJ took a while for me to get into. Although I'm not a fan of mythic novels, I think any supposed guide should be written so that someone unfamiliar with it's subject can understand it. I didn't get that with The Writers Journey. What I received was a book with a decent cover that bored me."
4,Very Helpful for Story Arc,"I almost gave up on my recent novel because I could not see the arc of the story and it didn't seem to have an ending. That was until I got a hold of The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure. It was extremely helpful and clear, and allowed me to build characters and create realistic plot based on age old stories that are natural to humanity.excellent.petra"
4,"The Writer's Journey, Second Edition: Mythic Structure for Writers","I found this book to be most helpful in developing characters more deeply according to their purpose in the story. The author presents an overview of the mythic structure with clear plot points delineating where the plot must change and how.Although some exercises are provided, they did not seem to be particularly helpful, but the reading itself was fascinating. After reading this book and watching a lot of the movies the author refers to, I find that I have a clearer picture of plot, character development and pivotal points, both in my own writing and in that of others. Any writer can benefit from studying this book."
3,12 steps for the journey,"I struggled to read this book initially due to the small font size and later due to content. I think anyone who has studied the classic mythologies and/or Joseph's Campbell's work will be bored by this as much is based on his work. I enjoyed the introductions and appendices the most, as I thought they revealed the author and served as a guide for real world applications. I decided to rent some of the movies the author was involved in to see how he applied his knowledge and intuition (taking into consideration studio control). I don't regret spending the time to read this book, as certainly it was written in a friendly, easily digestible manner and I admired the author for welcoming criticism."
5,Memo to readers:,"""The Writer's Journey, 2nd ed.: Mythic Structure for Writers"" is disappointing reading, because ""compendiums"" don't make for good reads. Vogler, in spite of inaccuracies, is guiding us through his interpretation of Joseph Campbell's knowledge of myth and storytelling. That knowledge was vast. Vogler's contribution to writers and lovers of storytelling is tremendous. He gives us a glimpse into how deeply embedded storytelling is in the human psyche and how to use it against those movie studio suits. Hopefully, Vogler will be credited with starting an important trend: Intelligence and thought in modern movie making."
4,"Compelling, insightful--fears of hack enablement are overstated","Combining interesting glosses on old favorites with a decent exploration of how to frame one's own tales, The Writer's Journey is lively and thought-provoking. I think the fears of some that this book is nothing more than a Insta-hack book that will enable scores of talentless dorks to pump out scripts are overstated. Instead, I suspect that this book will enable some thoughtful creative minds who have been other hopelessly befuddled by form gain expression.As far as the idea that the book is a shameless ripoff of Joseph Campbell--as far as the ripoff part, I can't say. I haven't read Campbell. But the book is so worshipful of Campbell, I can't imagine that Campbell is turning over in his grave over the appropriation.Recommended."
5,Excellent approach to plotting,"Chris Vogler offers a clear and straight forward framework from which to build plots. Reference to archetypal structure, with the accessible examples offered by film references, sets forth the basic concepts that fill strory structure.This book will help any writer, new or established, to lay out the elements of a plot that reaches out to readers."
4,"Insightful, engaging","Based on the premise that ""All stories consist of a few common structural elements found universally in myths, fairy tales, dreams, and movies,"" the third edition of this ever evolving, useful work builds on concepts drawn from the writings of Carl G. Jung and the mythic studies of Joseph Campbell. Showing great passion and insight, Vogler digs deep into the very infrastructure of storytelling, revealing, as he states in his preface, a ""beautiful design, a set of principles that govern the conduct of life and the world of storytelling the way physics and chemistry govern the physical world."" More of an ""A ha!"" than a ""how to"" book, The Writer's Journey should provide anyone with any interest at all in reading or telling tales with many hours of pleasurable and informative reading. Recommended."
5,Useful book for the classically centered writer,"This book is an exploration of the way my college English professors said great writing occurs. If you studied literature with dynamic characters and a tight plot, you will understand. This book is basically about using mythology and deity-archetypes as the story and characters. I wouldn't say it is based on any mythology in particular although examples from Greek and Norse myths seem to the basis for examples. Jungian archetypes are mentioned as well. The author does not encourage writers to copy the ancient myths, but to be inspired by them and to use them as a guide, especially if you are a fledgling writer. This is not what I would consider a ""fluff"" book either. It strongly reminds me of a textbook itself.Two other books I would recommend to complement this book are:45 Master Characters: Mythic Models for Creating Original Characters by Victoria Lynn Schmidt20 Master Plots and How to Build Them by Ronald B. Tobias"
3,Good analysis of Story Structure,DO NOT buy this book if you are starting out as a screenwriter or you will most likely be lost. However I highly recommend this to people who have written several screenplays and/or already have an understanding of Film and more importantly structure.
2,Yawn!...,"I just skimmed this, so take that into account. Too boring to read much of it. Too analytical. Little about the art of writing. It strikes me as a kind of mechanical approach which is diametrically opposed to what art should be."
1,Why is the type so small?,"This is the first book I've ever returned because the type was too small--and there's nothing wrong with my eyes. Pick this up in a bookstore before you buy it here and decide for yourself. I'm going to try to find the 2nd ed. somewhere and see if that is readable, but there's too much on my reading list for me to wade through something like this.EDIT: The 2nd Ed. has standard type--I highly recommend this version if you can find it. The book itself is brilliant!"
4,"Easy, practical, sensible","This is a book about storytelling. We've all heard, read, or seen, stories told badly at one time or another, but few of us have been able to discern why we were disappointed in a production. Telling a story poorly is like telling a joke poorly. Yeah, the words are there, the premise and punch line are laid out, but it's just not funny... or interesting in the case of a story. This work is provides an understanding of the elements of a weel-told story, not as a template to be followed, or a strict set of rules, but as a philosophy, one that has been employed at least since Gilgamesh. Read it, then put it away. use the knowledge it has provided to mold the feeling of your tale. Your work will be better for it."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This book has been recommended to me by many different writers and teachers. Because of this I came to the book thinking it would be fantastic. But while I think the author makes many good suggestions and analyses, my overall impression is that the book is restrictive. The guidelines and the stages of the hero's journey seem, to me, formulaic and not conducive to freedom of imagination, at least not in plotting novels. I much prefer books such as Kernen's Building Better Plots and Tobias's 20 Master Plots, neither of which I find to be restrictive or fixed on formulas. However, if one wants to write novels with ""mythic structure,"" I suspect that the formulas in this book work very well. But the formulas, despite the author's contentions, don't apply to all fiction."
4,Great Foundation for Screenwriters,"Well this is the formula that Hollywood wants. If you're an indie writer/filmmaker then you either should have read this already and hate it or you won't follow any of this because it's ""Hollywood"" so why buy it? For everyone else, this book gets down to the fundamental structure you need to write a movie that Hollywood wants to make. I would recommend the book ""The Alchemist"" to go along with this book which essentially follows this book's formula down to the ""t"". I liked it, but if you are training professionally, you're going to see this formula in one form or another like a thousand times (literally). This is recommended for the ""hmm, I should at least entertain the idea of becoming a screenwriter because it has always been in the back of my mind"" crowd. Otherwise, it is remedial (yet, important) for most writers."
4,Fascinating study of archetypes,A very interesting look at archetypes from the perspective of a screenwriter. There's a lot to be gleaned here both by fans of film as well as would be writers.
5,GREAT BOOK!,"This is one of the better books I've purchased on writing. Great ideas, inspiration and so many writing tools are presented that there is no way you can fail if you create your charcter arc, plot structures and dialogue with the knowledge Vogler offers."
3,And I always thought they were cliches...,"I am a cartoonist and I thought this book might be helpful to me, just as a writing-tool. And I must say; it has given me quite a few pointers on how to approach scriptwriting in general. This volume is specifically keyed towards movies, but I found it helpful nonetheless. It is quite strange to find out that a lot of the archetypes and mythical structures discussed in this book are already ingrained in my artistic conciousness."
5,Excellent resource!,I recommend this book to all my screenwriting students. Vogler's approach is that of the classic storyteller. A must-read.
5,Super!!,"This book was a really big help for me. I just recently decided to change my eating habits and limit all or most meat in my diet. This book was such a super help to me. It broke down all the facts and made them easy to understand, This book didn't preach that you have to be a vegetarian, it gave several reasons why people switch to this type of diet.If you are just starting out on this new adventure in your life like I am, this book is very, very helpful, and informative. It contains recipes to get you started, and they look really simple! This book is great and I recommend it to anyone new to the vegetarian lifestyle!"
5,"""Becoming Vegetarian"" is the most informative book for a new","""Becoming Vegetarian"" is the most informative book for a new vegetarian that I have found. It has sections dealing with every potential pitfall to vegetarian dining that one is likely to encounter. Given this book and the desire to stop eating meat, you CAN do it safely and improve your health.Tips from this book lead to me checking my B1-B12 intakes as well as my iron with the result that I now supplement my diet.Highly recommended by a former carnivore."
4,Great intro book,Easy to read and a good book to use as a jump-off point for more specific readings catering to your individual vegetarian interests.
1,Not what I needed.,"I was looking for a book with basic ""beginning recipes"" for those considering giving up meat. This book concentrates on the scientific benefits of vegetarianism. In short I found it to be a biology text book."
4,Becoming Vegetarian,Although this was an older version of this book I found the information in it to be very applicable. If you're thinking about going vegetarian this is a good place to start.
4,Being vegetarian,This book was just what I was trying to find with lots of information on how to eat well as a vegetarian.
1,bad,"it jamed my bose, finally got it out and threw it away!!!!!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN.................THIS WAS A TERRIBLE SELECTION OH YEA"
5,A gem of a CD,"The Diamonds had a vim and vitality that few groups had back then, and their classic ""Little Darlin'"" headlines this CD, whose cuts are way above average. Once you are through the 25 selections featured, you want more and more. I saw them live at the famed ""Rock and Roll Palace"" in Kissimmee, Florida, and that led me to garner their music on vinyl. Those LPs and 45's are rarities now.......but you can have the best of them on this CD. Come on, little darlin'.......add this CD to your collection now!"
5,Excellent cd,"My sisters mother-in-law loved this cd. She was so excited to get it as a Christmas gift. Thanks for the free and prompt delivery. Blessings, Joanne"
2,shirts,"Very dissappointed in this shirt as I purchased it for work. After two wearings the front started to all ball up. They are very hot to wear since they are made of polyester/cotton which I didn't pay attention to when ordering them. They do wash well, are true to fit and I love the choice of Colors. Just wish they were 100% cotton."
1,Not much to recommend,"I thought I would go back to my grandparents heritage,all four born in Ireland, and try some Irish Tea. I recently had a heart problem and my cardiologist recommended that I significantly decreae my caffeine intake. I used to drink several glasses of iced tea every day. Strangely enough tea has at least as much caffeine as coffee. Green tea is definately out as an alternative to coffee or other beverages; but black tea is fine.I picked up some store brand black tea bags (Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Chai)to make iced tea and I was quite pleased with the heartiness of the flavor. I then researched the matter further and came accross the Taylor's Decaffeinated Irish Breakfast Tea. I was quite disappointed with the results. I like strong tea, and must use at least 14 tea bags to get the same results as 10 tea bags of the store brand. As you might guess the store brand ia a lot less expensive. I will use up the 6 boxes that conisted of my order, and then buy the store brand again."
1,Bad tea!,"This tea is stale. I have had this brand and kind of tea many times, so I know how it should taste. It's dated Jan. 2013, but it must have been stored improperly. It has no fragrance and no taste. Even the teabag paper looks yellowed. It is worse than supermarket tea. I cherish my breakfast tea, so am very disappointed, especially having bought six boxes of this useless stuff. I tried to give it no stars, but that's not allowed, so I gave one for prompt shipping."
3,Pleasing CD single,"This CD single has three tracks- the Album Version (5:24), the Remix (4:59), and the Album Version (Instrumental) (5:29)."
4,history of karate,"The Hand is My SwordRobert Trias was the father of modern American karate, opening the first U.S. dojo in 1946. Although this book contains much information from his ""Pinnacle of Karate,"" this book does a good job of explaining the history of karate and the basics of karate as taught by Trias. This book explains many of the principles of Okinawan style karate as taught in the United States, particularly the Shorei, Shorei-goju and Shuri styles which he founded."
1,Where do they get this stuff from,"This is the biggest load of BS that I have seen in a long time. No Itosu Kata, No Matsumura Kata, No Miyagi Kata yet it claims Okinawan origin. If you spend money on this I have some ocean front property in Arizona...."
3,Syd Barrett - 'The Radio One Sessions' (Strange Fruit) 3 1/2 stars,"Good, well decent... rare radio broadcast of a John Peel session. Believe the rarity of this performance sort of over rides the sound quality, although it's acceptable. I thought ""Gigolo Aunt"", ""Two Of A Kind"", the trippy ""Baby Lemonade"" and ""Dominos"" made this CD at least worth checking out. Line-up: Syd - guitar & vocals, Dave Gilmour - organ, bass & guitar and Jerry Shirley (Humble Pie, Fastway) - drums. My only complaint is this release should have been longer than a mere twenty minutes. Next time, add some bonus material. Pretty much aimed toward the completists."
5,Even better than Gevalia!,"I am always on the look out for high-end flavored coffee (I mean, Starbucks doesn't even offer it-insert raspberry here)!This coffee is Ultra cinnamony! And I put a dried cinnamon stick in the coffee pot to spice it up even more. Not one of those pallid cinnamon flavored combinations with hazelnut or some such dilluter.So terrific, I ordered FIVE pounds from Red Buffalo directly after my first brewed cup! I cannot wait to taste all their other infused flavors."
3,Somewhat cumbersome but does the job,I find this shaker very useful when I make Martinis. The lid however is somewhat hard to remove. You need to be very careful not to splash the contents of the shaker while trying to remove the lid.
4,It looks good.,"This is a Christmas present for my nephew so not sure how well it works. It looks good, product arrived in a timely manner."
1,Leaks,"This shaker leaked in two places on the very first use. Also, it is difficult to pour through the strainer. Returned item for refund."
1,Broke on the first use?,"I ordered this product, then I used this product when some of my friends were over. This product immediately broke during use. I'd suggest getting something more durable and something that actually works."
2,Sitting in my car port,"I bought this eliptical trainer over a year ago and I agree with the other raters: it is squeeky, the foot pads rub agains the back part of the trainer and the display doesn't work. I would NOT recommend this product."
3,Got this machine for free and was wondering if anyone could answer some questions for me?,"I like using this product but I agree with other reviews that this product is a little squeaky and wobbly. I also can't figure out how to enter a person's weight, height, sex, etc. but can see that they can be entered somehow. If anyone could help me out with this or send a link to a page that has it I would appreciate it!"
2,Not that great!,"I purchased this product 2 months ago; it has already started wobbling when you workout and squeaking. It started out great, but not so great real fast. I bought the product initially because of good reviews, but I have to say I'm not that sastified. I think its almost worth paying quite of bit more money for a quality product...instead I have wasted $500."
3,Insufficient,"No mention of pop-up ads, dumocrats, fat chicks, dry counties, or trial lawyers. Disappointing. HHD."
2,Good Research But Lack of Economic Theory,"Jaccard makes some strong arguments throughout the book. Clearly a lot of research has gone into the data.However, Jaccard makes a lot of assumptive statements, not backed up by enough economic theory. The book swings between being from an ecologist's point of view and an economic stance, but Jaccard makes his thoughts know when he jokes that economists ""don't know they are lying"", and that economics' ""abstract models get in the way of seeing reality"".Further more, there is no mention of the Hotelling Principle that is key to this area of energy and natural resource economics.A good read if you are wanting to know more about fossil fuels, but a bit disappointing if you are wanting to learn more than the scaremongering propaganda that you read in a newspaper."
5,great deal,This medicine ball was just what I was looking for. The price was great and it is a quality product.
1,Poor Output,"I purchased QIP Toner, since it cost less. However, the result from using the product is entirely consistent with other poor reviews. The Toner caused streaking and dark pages. The dark pages eventually went away when I switched back to the Brother Brand toner.It did not perform anywhere close to the Brother Brand Product."
2,Don't skimp on OEM toner,Made the mistake of not heeding the oft heard advice to not buy brand name toner. I hated this thing. I would get streaking and splotching on my papers. Everything corrected once I started using the Brother inserts again.
4,Common Law Pleadings,"Since I am a novice at pro se litigation, this book is very advanced for meI am confident that the text is excellent and I approach this like learning a foreign language- learn what words and phrases mean."
5,"IF YOU CAN ONLY READ ONE BOOK ABOUT ISRAEL, LET THIS BE IT!",This was absolutely the BEST book I have ever read regarding the history of the conflict in Israel. I had been unable to find books about the early history of the area that didn't seem biased toward one point of view or the other. STRUGGLE FOR THE HOLY LAND provides a point of intersection in which the interests and aspirations of each side are carefully evaluated. William Hare is truly a talented author with a gift for presenting complex historical events in a way that even the non-history buff can understand and enjoy. Your only disappointment will be when there are no more pages to read! A rare find!
2,Save your money,"This book is not very in-depth, the reviews are short and not terribly accurate. There are plenty of cheap places to eat if that's what you want and it feels like they wrote this book to travel around Maui as a ""critic"" to get recognition and cheap food. Maui Revealed is much better."
5,Thomas And Friends: Trouble On The Tracks,My son (3) loves it. Even my daughter (5) likes it to but not advanced enough for her.
4,Internetworks of plenty,"Describes IP, IPX, Decnet, and appletalk protocols. It's a must have for those of us running legacy networks."
5,Vent Visors,"Once I got the right visors for my vehicle I rate them highly. Every vehicle I purchase gets visors on them and the EGR brand is one of the best. I got the wrong ones first due to a mix up in section through the Amazon listings. I then contacted EGR and they gave me the right part number to order. Done, great stuff and the price is right."
5,"Perfect color, but not as it shows here.","Another reviewer stated that this sand is not white as pictured. That is correct. If you want to see the true color, check the 5 lb listing, it is perfectly pictured there. The 5 lb bag color as shown is exactly what I wanted, so I am happy. Hopefully my Mali Uromastyx, Scrabbles, likes it too. :)"
3,sand at its best,"good sand for the reptials, bad shipping! they had to resend it to me three times before it acually got here without being damages (leaking sand out of box) but once I finnally got it I was happy with it"
4,Great First Holy Bible,"I bought this for my 6 year old neice & my 4 year old. They loved that it was pink! Pink page edge/pink book marker ribbon. The size is nice -smaller than most of the bibles I viewed so it made easier to carry for them. I liked that is was New Living Translation instead of King James Version- easier to read/understand for them. There is about 65 pages worth of colorful illustrations that include short verses about picture. My 4 year old liked those pages- very colorful. In front it has a page for child ""all about me"". There is NO dedication in front to put to/from/date-which is one of the bummers, 2nd bummer- I wish there were MORE then 65 colorful pages. I would recommend & will probably get the blue boy version for my son when he gets older."
4,Great starter Bible for children,"I like the book, but just wish it wasn't quite so thick. I chose it though for the larger print words and pictures inside. It would be neat though if the pictures weren't in clumps, but spaced throughout the entire Bible."
3,"It has good chapters, but...","This book has a couple of good chapters on the problems of implementing the Markowitz model. Interestingly enough, I understood better the resampling idea in Scherer's article (a clean and honest review in my opinion which Michaud understandably hates) than in the entire Michaud's book. If I'm not mistaken the basic resampling idea was originally due to Jorion. Michaud patented it a variation of it. Now if you want to implement the ideas presented in this book, you are by law forbidden to do it (because it is patented). In that sense I think this book should be free (since as another reviewer below put it, it is a sales pitch.) There is an interesting review on this troubling trend of patenting really basic algorithms in Wilmott Magazine. Still it makes interesting reading. 2 1/2 stars."
3,Suboptimal,"Actually the author does lead a consulting firm, as possibly conjectured by the last reviewer. No wonder his lack of clarity in the how-to phase.For interested readers, Scherer has a good explanation of how resampling actually works. He also claims, in my view rightly, that Bayesian optimization is much better ... pity that commercial software is not as readily available as in standard portfolio optimization.Anyway, overall I agree with the judgments of earlier reviews: the book is good as a reminder of the weaknesses in standard optimization, but the solutions it proposes are suboptimal. Read Scherer instead for theory, although implementation isn't any easier and price is even worse."
1,Inadequate,This book's pages run off the left side of all the pages so it is impossible to read. I would return it but the cost and effort isn't worth it. Suggest you do not order this book.
2,Ok,"At one time Vivaldi operatic recordings were rare, so this was a groundbreaking recording and much appreciated. It is not a bad recording, but with the wealth of Vivaldi operas now in print, there is little need for this particular recording. Eileen Mager has a pleasant voice and the harpsichord accompaniment is quite heavy, but not unpleasant. Isola Jones struggles a little because she tries to put extra emphasis by singing much louder at some points, which seems a bit unnecessary and is not a very effective tool for highlighting certain moments in the singing."
2,Bizzare,"I bought one and thanks to its malfunction I am now a stapler engineer. It is very heavy and a somewhat awkward design. Mine (an older one) says to use SF 15 staples which are actually SF 4's these days. However a manufacturing defect with mine at the staple hammer area squeezes the SF 4's and they can't reach into the hammer zone. However - My stapler works with Standard staples SF 1's just ok to average. Also, the anvil is part of the plate and the plate has slotted screw holes for adjustment. After adjusting I still get wacky staple bends in the back of the paper. Lining up the pamphlet on the seam just right takes some skill. Will work through this to complete concepts prior to sending off to printing house but then it is going in the trash."
5,Paper Magic.,"Positively fabulous book on paper craft. The arcitectural designs are somewhat more advanced, but the butterfly is probably the easiest and more effective for the beginner."
5,Corum does it again!,"Few historians are consistently good. Corum is! This book is as scholarly, informative, insightful and interesting as his first book, THE ROOTS OF BLITZKRIEG. Together with his new book co-authored by Richard Muller, these works justifiably earn Corum the reputation as America's leading authority on inter-war German military doctrine.Corum's analysis of the personalities, ambitions and professional viewpoints of the leading German airmen, and their impact on the development of airpower doctrine and aircraft types, is the best available.I'm proud to own this book. You will be too."
3,There are better out there,"Well, this dictionary is okay, but it does not have a lot of those necessary everyday words in it. I bought this to use in my college Spanish class, and I use my old, beat up dictionary from high school (Larousse Pocket Dictionary) a whole lot more. This one just doesn't offer a lot to me."
3,Okay,"This knife is plenty sharp, but it doesn't have great balance or heft. I have other Wusthof knives that have great balance and grips. I bought this to replace an 8 in Cutco chef's knife which also feels much better to work with, although I admit I also prefer the shorter length.. This knife gets the job done, but does not make chopping a joy."
5,Bettering The Debut,"If you enjoyed Republica's 1996 debut but forgot about them after they failed to get Stateside attention, this album is worth your time. Probably your $$$, too.The debut was brash and fun and sped by. For a techno-leaning band, they left a lot of space in those songs. 'Speed Ballads' is the natural progression into late-90s alterna-pop. The beats are still fast and hard but the melodies are sharper and better executed and any empty space is filled with studio tricks and ear candy.The biggest progression, evident on the first listen, is in the songwriting. Saffron's melodies twist and turn in often unexpected ways. The songs sound different from one another. The influences (David Bowie, Blur, Blondie, Pulp and The Jam) are easily discernible but incorporated in interesting ways.Just on a few spins, I can recommend this as one of the better albums of the late '90s."
5,Easily Beyond 4 Stars,"While not perfect, this is one mighty exciting album. ""Faded Man"" is a great ballad. Rather than Sting and Britney Spears ushering in the new millennium, it would have been great to see Republica's ""Millennium"" catching the world by storm on New Years Eve. Unfortunately the band broke up and their US distribution rights went to hell. The electronic production is really fantastic on this, with maybe only Econoline Crush's HDCD The Devil You Know and Garbage's self title edging it out as more complicated. The mastering is on the bright side, but tends to be revealing in a good way."
4,a great second album,this album is also good as the first one. pop it in the cd player and get ready to sing and dance.
1,Major Disappointment,No wonder Republica got dropped by RCA and then broke up. This cd is awful. I loved their self-titled album but Speed Ballads was a major let down.
