3,So-so if you have a larger child,"Okay, these leaked for my child. Always, not just sometimes, but always! But, I have a larger child than most, so you just have to look for what works the best. Usually pampers worked better than huggies when he was younger, but now it's the reverse. Seems strange to me that that is how it worked out, but Huggies seem to be more absorbent for older children than they are for newborns. Check out Huggies too - you might be surprised."
1,Don't Buy New Pampers Cruisers!,"We were disappointed to see that Pampers changed their diapers without notifying consumers. The biggest complaint we have was the removal of the mesh liner - which was the whole reason we were loyal to buying Pampers Cruisers. These diapers give our daughter a horrible rash now every time she wears one. We have since switched to cloth and will not buy any Pampers product again unless they bring back the old liner. There is also NO absorbent layer on the entire back panel of the diaper! If DD is laying on her back, it all just comes right out the back side! They are an inferior product now, but still charging premium prices. I'd rather buy a store brand at this point, if I weren't totally giving up on disposables altogether! Very upset about this change. We used to love them, and have been buying them since DD was born - but no more."
5,Awesome diapers,"We usually use cloth diapers, but like disposables for night and for when the boys are at the sitters. We tried all sorts of diapers, but these are the only ones that fit both babies (they are shaped very differently even though they wear the same size diaper according to weight) and don't leak at night. They also seem a lot more comfortable for the babies. I hate regular Pampers because of the way they fit, but these are by far the best."
2,Bring back the old cruisers!!!,"Yes we found out, too, when the new box was delivered. I noticed right away it was so thin and the mesh lining was nowhere to be found. Sigh... I went to Pampers website and they don't mention anything. I guess they didn't want to advertise they cut cost. The exterior of box looks the same, too, except the product is no longer the same quality. On Amazon product description diagram, they show the old design with mesh liner, which is no longer there. Pampers cruiser now looks like their cheaper Baby Dry model. We've been using pampers since my daughter was a newborn, when I tried so many diapers and decided on cruisers. But now we will have to change to something else! It's not Amazon's fault but we will be stopping our diaper subscribe & save, too. Arg.... So annoying!"
2,Pamper changed - now they leak,I bought a new box a cruisers and notice right away there was no mesh liner anymore. I have a 9 month old and has always used pampers. I used to love the cruisers but now the new diapers are not as soft and they leak. I suppose Pampers found a way to cut costs.
3,Quality has deteriorated,"I have been using pampers for my 15 month old daughter since birth. They are much softer and comfortable than Huggies that are stiff and rough. Pampers are also far more leakproof than any other diapers. I was 100% satisfied and a loyal customer to pampers till I ordered my last pack of Pampers cruisers size 6. They looked different and lightweight than before,which in fact was not a good change as they have taken out the granules from the base that made they highly absorbant. Since then my daughter has had two leak incidents. I had lately read a customer's review who was utterly disturbed at this change by pampers. Now I completely understand and can empathize. I am thinking about going to huggies little movers as I can buy them in bulk at Costco. Why pay more when its not worth it. Pampers has disaapointed me.I can't say if change in quality is true for all sizes though!"
5,best diapers around,"My little girl has been in pampers since the day she was born and I love them! Even in the awkward crawling stage we didn't have any leaks.Once she got to be 9-10 months and still taking a night time bottle we did have some leaks at night, and then I started using huggies overnights only because I could not find a similar pampers product.We never had a problem with the mesh lining, but my daughter has had some bad diaper rashes, the worst were actually strep infections on her skin and I don't think the best diaper could have prevented them.I also have never had a problem with the silica lining coming out, but I do know for a fact that the lining is NOT poisonous. I had a friend whose son insisted on chewing the diapers and she called poison control to find out.We have started to switch up to pull ups 2/3T for overnight and naps now that we are potty training and they also work great! No leaks and my daughter thinks they are underpants."
5,"Great product, but SAMS is cheaper...","We love these diapers, but Amazon keeps creeping up the price. SAMS Club now has these for $29.00 plus tax. Even with the free shipping, SAMS is cheaper."
5,Like the shape,Great diapers. Absorption is good. The shape is very important to me since my baby has a relatively large bottom. Pampers' diapers have the best bottom coverage compared with other leading brands.
4,Loyal Pampers user,"Both my girls have always been Pampers babies. I have tried Huggies, but they are just too bulky with the same absorbance. I like the idea of Huggies' diaper shape, slimmer I the middle. I wish Pampers would come up with diapers in that shape, then it would be perfect for my girls."
5,fits well,"Pampers are rated the best in many baby books. After having tried it, I was pleased and found that it fit my baby the best. - Noga Delshad"
3,Cruisers not so good as swaddlers,"I used to buy swaddlers and liked them. But when it is time to switch I tried cruisers on my baby, and I did not like them with the quality."
5,Can't beat the price,I have found that you can't beat Amazons Pampers prices and the best thing is that they show up on my door step often in less than a week!!!!!!!! No tax and no shipping.I buy all of my diapers from Amazon. The only down side is that I haven't figured out if or how to use manufactures coupons on Amazon's site for even greater savings but the deals are as good as it gets.
2,Beware of Allergy,"I love pampers cruisers and swaddlers. Cloth like, very little leakage, no leaking blue gels, and no stuck together gatherings. Unfortunately, I found out that my second child all the sudden became allergic to Pampers; I think it's the new ones with dry weave liners. He started to have red bumps on his bottom everywhere not characteristic of diaper rash (back, crotch, scrotum) and will not go away with diaper rash cream, topical antibiotics nor antifungals. I'm a pediatrician so I was really puzzled. I finally switched him to Huggies and used steroid cream and they went away. I even called Pampers and they told me that the diapers are still the same. ?@$#$ I found out that this is not uncommon with Pampers. So moms beware. If your baby comes down with just red bumps everywhere and will not get better with diaper rash crea or antifungals (nystatin, clotrimazole), it might be an allergic reaction."
2,The new pampers are leaking,The new Cruisers leak all the time. I will be switching brands after using Pampers for almost 2 years.
1,Construction lower quality than before for pampers,I used to be a dedicated Pampers consumer since my baby was born. This last round of pampers diapers were poorly contructedWhen the baby wears them you can see from outside of the diapers that the padding ends much lower than in prevous versions of this diaper. There used to be a mesh on the inside to keep moisture away and that is now gone.My baby is on the low end of the weight requirement for this diaper and they still leak.I have since switched from Pampers.
2,new mesh liner means more leaks,"Like the other mom reviewer, I always used cruisers. The latest box did not indicate that Proctor and Gamble had altered the product. The new ones with mesh liner are not as aborbent. My son leaked nightly and soaked his clothes and his sheets. This did not happen when we used the original version of Pamper cruisers."
4,Product is great but shipping is unacceptable,This is the only product that our kids use.we have tried other brands ( huggies ) and we find that our kids get diaper rash fairly easily. We finally tried pampers and we notice that our kids have less diaper rash.Great diaper.Problem: not with the product but with the shipping. By the time we received the packages the box was already beat up and opened. Fortunately the diapers were not damaged.I woild like to suggest to have the actual diaper box put in a shipping box to protect the item.Hope this help out.
1,terrible,Half of the diapers burst open spilling the diaper pellets EVERYWHERE. Amazon credited me $10. Not much comfort considering I spent $60 on the boxes of diapers. They told me that they were aware of the problem. I would have ordered a different diaper if I knew about the problem ahead of time.
5,The best,"Tried others of similar price - didn't care for Huggies, HATED Luvs (really, hated). This is the best price I've seen anywhere. Get them, your baby will thank you (in her own way...)"
2,terrible diapers!,"Who designed the shape of Pamper diapers? I feel it is the worst shape for a diaper. Its tab is far blow waist position , which induces my son leaking poos from back and leaking pees from sides. To avoid leaking, I have to tightly package him, which induce red inprint on his legs. I bought Huggies diapers and Especially for Baby diapers for my son. He seems comfortable in them. Most important, no leaking happens any more! My son weight only 15 lbs."
3,"Diapers Great, Delivery Poor","These diapers work great for our child, however, I have been disappointed with the delivery. My order often stays in an ""item not yet shipped"" status for days on end even though Amazon states that they are in stock and can be delivered within a few days."
4,Great diapers - but needs a new color,"We've tried Pampers, Huggies, and Target brand for our 11 month old. The Target brand feel cheaper and just don't hold as much, so we end up using more diapers. They also won't make it through the night. Huggies are fine if you get a good one. However, the quality control is very low, so about half of the diapers have a problem with the ""elastic"" bands around the legs. They are folded over each other and so won't stop messes. Overall, Pampers are the best. The only issue is that the Cruisers have a purple stripe down each leg. I wish Pampers would make them all white. Oh well."
4,"Great, Diapers","I was really happy with Pampers Cruisers. I did recently change over to the Pampers DRY, they are a litle cheaper and you still get the same great product."
5,Great deal!!!!!!,"As the mother of a toddler, diapers are on the list of things to buy every time we go to the store, so having them delivered is a great convenience, and the price can't be beat! Great value and hassle free delivery - what could be better (potty-trained, I suppose!!:))"
4,Simply the best,"I have been using Pampers for my baby boy since he was 6 months old and now he is 14 months and still almost no leakages except on some rare occasions. Definitely better than huggies (even the night ones) which I used previously but there were too many leakages, so we switched to pampers. Also it is very nice to collect points and receive gifts."
5,Pampers Cruisers rock,Love the Pampers Cruisers and the price here is way better than in the stores and even better than some of the cheaper brands in the stores if you price it out. Shipping was free and I got them in 3 days. I will definitely order again!
2,Still pricey,"Even on sale at Amazon, this is not one of the better prices I've found on these diapers. Even at regular price, they are $9-$10 at Wal-Mart and with a coupon, you can purchase them for $7-$9 depending on the coupon. The diapers are great, the prices are not."
2,Another price/shipping gripe!,I love Pampers Cruisers and ordered some a few weeks ago when the price was low. I STILL haven't recieved the diapers! It's taking forever! I checked back and I can't believe the price increase. I won't be buying these here anymore...WalMart it is!
3,Makes my daughter's behind red,"I decided to try this product since my daughter just started crawling; I had been using the Pampers Baby Dry diapers. I like the Baby Dry product very much so I was thinking this would be a step up since they are more expensive and ""made for mobile babies"" but, alas, it is not so. They leave little white debris on my daughter's butt and the gel they use for absorbency gives her a rash.I like the Baby Dry and I have already purchased a box of these for when she runs out of the Cruisers."
3,Not as good as Huggies...,"After reading the reviews, I've decided to give pampers a try and was slightly disappointed. It worked well as far as keeping the baby leak-free from #1. However, did not work as well as the huggies when it comes to leak-free from #2. My baby often take #2 with big force, so for that reason, it often leak out. The only brand that will minimize leaking out from the back is huggies."
5,Love the subscription service!,"These are the best diapers. Fit well and no problems with leaks, even overnight. I also LOVE the amazon subscription service. They are delivered right to my door and cheaper than I can buy them in stores, even Sam's!"
5,Great product!,"These are great diapers. I tried several other brands, but this worked best for my daughter. She's very comfortable wearing these. I'll definitely stick with Pampers until she's potty trained!"
5,they catch the poop...,real good. and they're comfortable and easy to use. what else can you say about diapers? no pee drips down his leg! actually... it's amazing how easy these are to use and how well they work. when you think about what our mothers had to work with... these are astonishing. he's happy. we're happy.
4,Milsap is Back,"I really do not know what Allana Nash was listening to. The songs I like the best on the CD are the more tradtional ones and the songs that crank it up as well. I think that Local Girls is one of the two weakest songs on the CD. There are definitely some songs that should make it in the top 20 or even higher. I think it just depends on if RCA chooses the right songs to bring out. I was not disappointed at all with the CD, I have been a Milsap fan for over 30 years and think that I am a pretty tough critic of his music. In fact, I did not even purchase his last effort, which tried to take his music way outside of the coutry bounds. I do not think others who buy this CD will be disappointed either. I just hope radio decides to give his new releases a shot."
4,Ronnie should be proud of this effort,"This is a solid album. Ronnie should be proud of this effort. Although I would like to have heard a little more up-tempo tunes this is a good album. It is much better than his past few albums yet doesn't match his 1980's tracks. Then again, no one, not even Ronnie, can match his prior musical landmarks. Overall, I was very pleased with this new release and hope ""My Life"" and ""You Don't Know My Love"" may be released as singles. He would have a shot at having some more top hits with these if the public has the chance to hear them. Good job Ronnie and this is well worth buying but don't expect to hear another ""Smokey Mountain Rain"" or ""He Got You"" because Nashville has changed too much for great country music. Pick one up, it is good and Ronnie still sounds great!"
3,Good,"Well I love Annie and so does our son. My only feedback is volume- for some reason it is hard to hear on our computer, kindle and phone. The best volume we get is if we hook our phone up to the car stereo and play the Amazon mp3 through the car."
3,If you aren't in a hurry,"The cd arrived in perfect shape during the time period that was promised. The only problem, however, was that this cd took MUCH longer to get to me than any other cd I've ever ordered. I've ordered numerous items from Amazon, I'm a fan. I thought the estimated time of delivery was a joke. It wasn't. It was as if they asked someone to walk it to my home. It was, however, in great condition and delivered within the time they promised. I'm certain all the other vendors would have gotten it to me quicker. I wish I would have known the estimate time of delivery earlier."
3,Must be my error,"I wanted the movie, not the music, but got the music only. Costs too much to send back, so eventually, I'll find the DVD movie cheap and buy it. The music is fine. As always."
1,Voice cassette,"I purchased a CD and an audio cassette of the movie Annie. This is a review of the cassette.If there were a no star rating, this would be it. The cassette was defective - not even one-half of it can be heard clearly. I would think that the seller would be more honest than to SELL a defective tape."
1,Don't Buy This Cd!,"This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks!"
5,A wonderful recording of the perfect Broadway cartoon.,"The most famous song from Annie is perhaps ""Tomorrow,"" and perhaps for good reason, and if you haven't heard Andrea McCardle sing it, you haven't really heard the song. But there are plenty of other good reasons to own this disc: All of the songs are great (including, or perhaps especially, the ones that were not in the film version), the performers are top-notch, and the disc sounds every bit as much fun as the show itself was. While the bonus material on the remastered version is fine, it's mostly unnecessary, as the rest of the show is that good. A wonderful disc, don't miss out on this, whether you're a fan of musicals or not."
4,andrea mcardle shines,"I've been a huge fan of Annie since I was little and first saw the 1982 film(not the best version of the musical but it introduced me to the wonders of the musical) at around the ages of 4-6. Since then, I've grown out a bit in my collection. I own two versions of the 1982 film on vhs, the new disney version, and both the obc recording(this cd i'm reviewing here) and the disney version of the soundtracks. Annie is a musical you can't help but love. From Tomorrow to Easy Street, it's oozing with a story any young girl can relate to, even if you aren't an orphan. The love Annie shows for wanting a family is touching and the songs are beautiful and well done by an incredible cast. Don't buy the soundtrack to the 1982 film unless you want to be confused, buy this one and learn the magic of Annie."
3,Disappointed,"I wasn't sure which soundtrack of ""Annie"" to buy, the 1982 film version or the 1977 original cast version. I took the advice of a reviewer. The 1982 version according to the review was 'terrible'. I bought the 1977 Broadway cast, and I'm sorry that I did. First of all, Annie on this recording has the most irritating voice. She strains and screaches. I'm not sure she's going to hit the high notes. Aileen Quinn's voice is more pleasing and frankly better. My niece just had the lead role in ""Annie"" at a prominent theatre, and HER voice was better than all of them (not because I'm her aunt, but because it was pointed out by strangers also). Aileen Quinn's voice is much more pleasing than Andrea's. Even the orphans on 'It's a Hard Knock Life' are better on the 1982 film than the Broadway cast. I guess the Broadway cast is known as THE ""Annie"", and everyone has their own opinion, but listen to both of the recording samples if you can, and you decide."
5,I take these daily.,I recommend this vitamin to all of my friends. I wasn't feeling up to par for a while so I decided to try a different multi. I turned to this one after talking to someone at the local health food store. I tried the first bottle and could definitely feel the difference. I don't take three. I take two in the morning with my breakfast and it seems to work. It does NOT make you jittery and contains NO caffeine which is great.
5,This really shows my age.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I am sure the kids today would laugh their head off if they sat down and watched this. But I never get tired of these. Wonderful old movies.
4,TCM Addict,"Love the classics, especially the ""Who done it"" classics, with Myrna Loy and William Powell and that's a good evening wih popcorn"
1,Bad packaging and the video is cut off,"I opened this to find 4 DVDs sandwiched together in one slot (totally scratched up) and when I played the first video, it started 5 minutes into the movie instead of at the beginning."
5,If You Love Classic Films,The Thin Man series starring William Powell and Myrna Loy is as entertaining today as they were when they were made. Nobody played a better drinker than Mr. Powell.
4,Very Informative Book,This is a really interesting book indeed that points out that there is a male hegemony that dictates how female bodybuilders develop and present themselves. Its a constant struggle for bodybuilders because they never know whether they need to develop more muscle or go for a softer more feminine look and are in a state of constant confusion and frustration. These women who represent power are really quite powerless in their sport the author asserts. Its a very interesting read but I deducted one star because the author has a terrible habit of having passages of some great quotes from bodybuilders and the contest judges and then she proceeds to simply repeat what was just in the quote. Its like reading the same thing twice. It is annoying indeed. Still I do recommend this book for female bodybuilding fans.
3,Read It (Avoid Using Needless Words),"This book is awesome. Why? It's short, to the point, and avoids needless words. For the beginner in Web usability or a pro, the principles are solid and transcend outside building Web sites. They could be used in multiple areas of life. I'd highly recommend and have given this book as a gift."
4,Some things are only obvious after they're pointed out...,"This book compels you to think about how people use websites. I tend to think in terms of visual appeal instead of funneling visitors towards a conversion. The author gives a lot of common sense ideas to use in compelling your visitors towards the actions you'd like them to perform. It's a good intro & I would recommend following up by reading Tim Ashs' ""Landing Page Optimization"" for more in depth material on this subject."
5,Great Little Book,"This is one of those books that you read and nod your head 'yes'. A few times I said, 'DUH!' while hitting my forehead.Things that are obvious but not thought of by the people creating the site.Great thoughts on testing and human factors analysis.Well worth the money!"
3,Review,I expected more to be honest but its fair enough. Author wanted to keep it short in purpose so i wont complain about it.
5,Review for testers. Great material for everyone else,"This is a great book for anyone who has never had any previous experience in UI, quality assurance or other testing. If you've previously worked in a testing environment, much of this book will be review for you or will cover things that probably come naturally. It is still worthwhile as a review but you won't find much in the way of revolutionary ideas."
4,Good book for understanding the basics of how to build usable web sites,I read this via Kindle on business flights. A quick read with good advice and guidance. The author definitely knows his stuff and does a good job of communicating the information in a succint manner. My only minor complaint is that the website samples are very dated and it would be nice to see those updated. I would also be interested to hear this author's opinion of more recent websites as many of them already have adopted some of his initial guidelines. So I would be curious to see what he would do now with them.
5,Worth the investment,An easy to follow and easy to understand book for those focused on web usability. Although Krug could go in to deeper information in many areas he does a good job of highlighting the most important aspects of usability while letting the reader conduct a deeper investigation on their own. A good reference for those wanting quick and useful insights to web usability.
3,Don't make me read.,"While this book does emphasize some simple but important UI points, the tone of the author resembles that of the jokes of a suburban dad driving his son back from soccer practice."
4,"If you are the big fan, it's ok to buy","Steve Krug clearly state the the 2nd edition will not change anything that much. He just add more 3 chapters with the reason that the heart of web usability isn't change from the last decade.The philosophy of 'simply is the best', 'Nice and clean' still working for the interface design business. If you are the big fan of Krug, it's ok to buy it. It still be the classic book for web usability. Actually, I will give the rate only 3 stars, but I add 1 more for the effort of Krug who try to add 'something new' on this edition.Well, I shouldn't buy the 2nd edition since it should contains the new thing more than this. I expect more new things in the 2nd edition. (Like 'Information Architecture for the WWW' revised their own book in the 2nd edition.)"
2,Is it really the best usability book?,"I have always heard about this book like the best usability book. ""It was wrote time ago, with outdated websites as example, but the concepts are the same"", I always heard. No way. (Review for Kindle Edition)I have been working in web development for the last 10 years, and I am a advanced internet user. So this books only cover things that every web designer or web developer should know if he have a little experience.The most valuable chapter is the one of user testing, that's because I have never done that tests in my work and it was new for me.But if you have a background in web design o web development, this book it's not very useful. Also, the website analysed are so old, that they have not much sense nowdays."
3,Terrible binding,"This is an expensive book (list price) for something less than 200 pages. Nonetheless the advice within it is worth every penny. I won't repeat what other reviewers have to say about the content. But please note that my copy fell apart before I'd finished the first read. The binding is awful. The pages fell out in ever increasing chunks until all I now have left is the cover and a bunch of sections that I have to keep stuffing back when I put the book away. And, it's a book that I refer to frequently."
3,dated and low on deep insights,"I like to wait a week or 2 after reading a book to decide how much I really got out of it. The answer for this book was ""not much"". The main take-home messages were ""don't use so many words"" and ""usability testing is important and easy to do yourself"". I just didn't get much out of it. The look & feel of most of the examples were so dated it was painful at times. Most of the content was really shallow and I didn't think told me any more than I already knew. I guess I would recommend not getting this book if you have ANY previous experience reading web design journals or any other books on the subject. That being said, some of the examples in the book were worth seeing, and I liked the for-anyones-use letters to bosses who want you to do terrible things at the end of the book.I was also really interesting the the usability testing portion of the book - but it was also too shallow. Maybe I'll give the ""rocket surgery made easy"" book a try.Worth borrowing but not buying."
5,Excellent Reference Book,"This book is an amazing reference book to help with building web pages that are built with the consumer in mind. Great book, I reference it all the time."
5,very helpful book!,The book is written in a way that common sense explanations help the reader to understand aspects of usability. So the reader does not depend on high technical knowledge.
1,This book is annoying,"For a guy that clams to be an expert on usability, this book for me has one fatal readability flaw.It is peppered with footnotes. Most are relevant and should be part of the text. Some are references and could be added in a ""Suggested further reading"" appendix. And some are pure noise.It makes the book hard to read. You read along and hit a footnote. You then need to look down to find out if the footnote is substance or not. Then find you way back to the text.This book loses nothing and would gain a lot if the footnotes went bye-bye."
1,Overrated,"One of the most overrated books in the history of design publishing.Dated and obvious when first published, completely useless now."
3,"Gives basic information, quite useful but not great","This book gives a quite nice idea of ""how TO think"" when working with the web, give some example of what is good n what is bad but nothing u do not already know, or at least u (if working with the web) are suppose to know.Is quite easy to read, the layout and the pics looks quite old. I would probably chose to read something which is more update and recent, of course general rules are still the same, the human brain is not changing so much in a short period of time like 7 years eighter, but, the web is changing very fast and the book is from 2005."
3,common sense would say you same,"i bought the book based on lot of those positive responses in amazon, also another books was referring to it. well, if you are totally new to web design and usability - maybe this is a good place to look at - but, most of things are little too common, you can work them out yourself. Annoying are also those comics & cartoon styles inside the book - reminds me a schoolbooks for a foreign language study. Too basic. really. and the amazon also changed a design, but a one section of a book is totally devoted on that :(. no more such tabs at amazon....as he writes in a book"
4,"Concise, easy read, good ideas","As the introductory matter suggests, this book can be read in a couple of hours. It's worth taking the time. It gives some very useful, simple guidelines to designing a good user interface and eliminating the interminable arguments that come down to matters of taste. The good and bad examples are illuminating and make the book fun to read."
5,Thinking done in ~1ms.,"Finished this short but informative book in 2 days. Steve Krugs gives advice on avoiding common usabilities issues.With that, here are a few things I picked up.- Test rather than argue with your team.- Users read in a hurry, so kill the noise by having less design and small talk, while filling the page up with unique content.- Avoiding ads on your home page, even though it has the highest traffic.- Provide aid for lost users. That includes a way to get to the home page, a site id, and other means of understanding their location.- Test each stage of your project at least once. The earlier the testing, the cheaper to repair."
5,"Great tips, and funny to boot!","This book gives you tips about how to set up your website so it will be more user-friendly ... and is a funny read as well! So many user manuals are long and dry, but Krug keeps the info down to the bare essentials, and makes the book highly readable and entertaining as well. Highly recommended.[...]"
4,A Great Usability Primer for Web Developers,"Yes, this is an entry-level book, targeted at the people who need it most: the frontline of Web developers and ""designers"". The content of the 2nd edition could be updated, but Krug's non-nonsense, easy-to-read approach still makes Don't Make Me Think one of the first books I recommend to my Web development students."
2,Definitely not worth reading,"I am definitely not a usability expert but I was expecting much more substance from a ""self proclaimed"" expert. The examples are so obvious, dumbed down and old (from 1999-2000). I think this book should entirely be written with Web 2.0 in mind. I agree that design principles do not change over time, and this book is not about technology, but users expect more and more with new technologies. While some design patterns stay the same, some evolve and become expected with the advent of newer technologies.Don't waste your time with this book, and buy a more recently written book for people who really want to know about usability."
5,The Single Best Volume on UI Design,"I have said for many years that ""there isn't one programmer who doesn't think he he can't do design, and there isn't one who can."" -- Steve Krug comes pretty close to proving that we can learn, though. This book is wonderful; it makes the essence of good design so clear that it seems obvious, seems like you've known it all along.This book should be read by anyone who has any intention of coming near a software development process. If you're going to be in the room, you need to have read this book. Otherwise, sit outside and stay very quiet."
2,Good book years ago,"For me this is one of the more pointless books that I have bought. Years ago I think this would have been a great read. But these days there are so many great examples of clean,user friendly and consistent sites that reading a book like this is not really needed. Just take a look at the more popular sites these days to see what to do (Amazon.com was an example used in the book).If your still not sure what makes a clean, user friendly site I guess that you can buy this book. I mean there are a lot of terrible sites these days as well. Just don't expect it to be anything ground breaking."
3,"Good, but you should have guessed this yourself","This is a fast read about making good Web sites. I agree with just about everything Krug says, and it's nice to hear him say it. Most of what he says is (or should be) common sense. However, there are so many web sites that violate his advice that it must not be common sense.Read the book, just don't expect any profound insights. Maybe you don't need profound insights to make a good web site."
3,Interesting and Short,"It has good chapters, but I think it should have more exmples, too much words, but is good in general."
4,Great book! Intelligent and funny,I just love this book! I have learned a lot of things about the usability problems in the sites I develop.
5,Short sweet and to the point.,"I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to design websites. It is very important for usability. It was designed to be a quick read and is easy to understand. The title of the book even helps me when I'm designing because I think the user doesn't want to have to think about how to navagate through a website, they just want to do what they have to do and move on.This book mostly focuses on e-commerce sites but it still has some good tips that may apply to any website.This book doesn't teach you HTML or any programing it is strictly usability."
5,This should be your first book on usability,"It's short, with many images, and yet it somehow manages to get to the point without talking about unnecessary things or repeating itself.If you are going to buy only one book about web usability, this should be the one. If you are thinking about buying Nielsen's books or something on that line, read this book first."
4,Easy reading,A lot of good points and easily read. Recommended for improving your web-site for the sake of your visitors. Absolutely recommended!
5,The most usable book ever,"Most technology and design books tend to be bloated, academic snoozers.Not this one.If you have anything to do with designing web sites and applications, buy this book for yourself and every member of your team. You will never, ever regret it."
5,Required Reading for Web Professionals,"This book just tells it like it is. Steve Krug gives you some of the best experience he has as a usability expert for the bargain price of this book.It is easy to get wrapped up in debates about how to organize a website. This book acknowledges that many of these debates are based on personal preferences rather than real-world usability data.If you pay attention to this easy-to-read material and exercise it on your websites, you will improve your vistors' experience and opinion of your site."
3,Start your studies with this,A good book for web design beginners who are just starting their studies or careers in the industry. Someone with a lot of UI design and usability experience won't probably get anything new out of this one (except some perspective I guess).The book is covering only the basics and is very light on content. On the other hand once you've got those basic design principles you are ready to go. The book is also very fast and fun to read and the author definitely has his own humorous style of writing. I hope we'll see more web design books like this one in the future. Books that are easy to digest between more serious reading.Other related suggested reading could be theDesigning the Obvious: A Common Sense Approach to Web Application Designby Robert Hoekman Jr. which is a bit more serious title but definitely good reading too.
3,Lots of Fluff,"Yes this book is quick and easy to read but it could have been condensed to 1/3 of its size if it dispensed with the chatty talk that added no value. I expected more ""meat"".I really enjoyed the section on user-testing because it echoed my experience. Having it echoed in a book gives it validation to show to clients.I think this book is way overrated. It is practical common sense and the target audience is for management and marketers who don't have any practical experience in this area."
3,Getting outdated,"Its a good book, written well but is getting outdated with the changes happening all around in the internet space. With mobile internet gaining momentum, the book is still stuck with early 2000 examples and solutions."
4,Common sense is obvious - so why do we miss it so often?,"I bought this book to help me with a project at work. I'm not an IT person but have somehow managed to get involved in an IT development project that requires me to focus on the user experience for a new system we're developing. We all know - on some level - what annoys us when we're searching the internet, but we don't always know why it's annoying. Or we don't always recognise why some sites are almost a pleasure to browse. This book has helped me understand some of the fundamental, common sense practices that make the difference between a good browsing experience and an annoying (or downright bad) one. It's an easy read that uses practical screen samples to demonstrate what it's saying. I've found it very useful and it has definitely made me look at my project in a different way."
4,Short and Sweet,"Great examples, relevant concepts, all and all a great book. I wish the examples were a little more up to date."
4,A useful tool,"As a professional, I would recommend it to everyone who needs an easy and quite complete guide to usability. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that it's a bit too informal for me. But I'm italian, and maybe this perception of excessive informality is simply due to cultural differences between our countries."
4,alternate view of The Peculiar Institution: The True Story?,"While Uncle Tom's Cabin raised the ire of Abolitionists across the North, Hentz's ""Northern Bride"" did much to put forth what she saw as a more accurate depiction of slavery in her beloved South. The Northern Bride moved South to be with her planter husband and had her eyes opened to the truth of the peculiar institution. Readers today will have to see if they agree with her depictions of the life of the enslaved through the flowery 19th century language of this southern patriot. While this book is harder to locate than Uncle Tom's Cabin, it ought to be read for its historical significance and to provide bases for discussion of the impact of slavery on both black and white populations of the period."
1,Review,"Interesting to illuminate historical context, but political goals make for a read that is both woefully predictable and, I hope we can assume, unpersuasive. Interesting and useful to historical scholars and racists."
3,Disappointing Quality,"This programme dates from around 1982 and includes a lot of very interesting videos and information on a wide variety of FLW architecture including some less well-known buildings. Some of the scenes have been staged with period costumes and vehicles to better show the building as it would have appeared in context when first completed. Content deserves 5 stars, but I can only give 3 stars due to the poor video quality. It appears to be taken from an old video tape with low definition images and juddering even for slow image panning. Plus the DVD is a cheaply produced DVD-R (or similar) rather than a proper factory-produced DVD. Overall, I don't regret buying this, but if only the producers could have done some image restoration (since afterall the images are so important in architecture), and I think that this disk should have been priced at around half of the listed price, say US$12."
2,"Don't think so, sorry","I hate to say this but this anime didn't catch my eye, and I didn't catch the comedy of it either.The story line is paper thin and you get the feeling as you watch each character introduce themself as if this is the second season of a long running show, that didn't sit well with me. I like some sort of beginning point: I'd stick to anime shows like; Fruits Basket, Midori Days, Chobits, Sister Princess and in August release of Negima: CAN'T WAIT!But who knows I stopped watching at the middle of episode two and put it in my discarded files of anime."
5,Still working after all these years!,"I have had this wireless weather station for several years, and it still works flawlessly. I have had both one and two remote sensors at a time with no problems. It is really easy to use, and I have had it both sitting on the counter and mounted to a wall. Either way it looks great, is easy to read and operate, and many people have commented on how much they like it. I am going to purchase another one for our lake cottage. Love it!!"
1,very poor,"I ordered the remote #138 sensor with remote probe. Received 2 units withou the probe, which is why I ordered them. Now I have the very large hassle of waiting for the correct items to be recived and returning the incorrect items. Quality control in the mail order business must be really poor."
2,A bit misleading,"I'll have to say that I picked this up due to the liner notes plugging it by saying it was worldbeat infused. I found that not to be the case though. The closest they come to that is the closing track ""Oloololo"". Still, that doesn't carry a worldbeat sound though. All in all, the high points here are ""From A Moving Train"" and ""Wednesday Morning"". ""Town & Country"" has some good character, as does ""Overwhelming World Suite"". It's lukewarm at best."
4,Very good one !,"From the two opening songs ""From a moving train"" and ""Wednesday Morning"" you are listening to classic America. The rest of the cd is not bad at all, but clearly those two songs are among the best ones ever recorded by the band (and this are not Russ Ballard songs). So you can hear the armonies and clarity of the recording....great work."
1,A True Embarassment!,"Never mind what some of the other reviewers have gushed about Human Nature.>People are selling it on Amazon for a penny! Think about that!This album should have never been released. For a classy group like America with a fairly impressive pedigree and an historical string of quality projects..especially their first few releases...this one is agonizing to listen to and makes your heart break for Gerry and Dewey.In the wake of a very solid latter day release like Hourglass, this one is extremely hard to take. Production is unbearably weak. This collection sounds like it was recorded on a shoestring budget. The songs themselves are non descript and the weakest in the entire America canon.Take it from someone who is an avid fan and owner of every single release by the guys, Human Nature is clearly the low point of a long discography.>It is noteworthy that after the abysmal failure of this album America ceased with new recordings."
3,An Honest Review by Acevedo Hapkido Academy,"The book, ""HanMuDo, Training Manual"", is well illustrated and is written to go along with the video/dvd of the set. It is not a stand-alone book, it has only one or two excellent photos to demonstrate a technique, making the video/dvd necessary to see the complete technique. Both the manual and vidoe/dvd omit the detail of the Han Mu Do forms, empty-hand and weapon that are an important part of the HMD rank requirements.The HMD rank requirements listed in the manual are somewhat different from the books, ""Han Mu Do"" and ""Hapkido II"". More information may be obtained from the World Han Mu Do Association - Grandmaster He-Young Kimm.The manual and video/dvd set are highly recommended for the serious student of Korean martial arts."
4,"fast paced, page turner","I have looked forward to Mr. Stewarts books in the past, but it has been a long long time since I have seen anything published...Would appreciate if anyone could tell me if he is still writing, has died or what the situation is."
1,Beautiful symphony ruined by terrible conducting.,"Sibelius' second symphony is one of my absolute favorite pieces of music. This recording, however, is an absolute travesty. Among other problems, the tempo in this recording is far too fast and it lacks the slowly rising tension that makes the piece so compelling. Its horribly frustrating to listen to. Try Davis or Karajan instead"
4,Love the scent,I'm not sure if it actually cleans the mat... I suppose it looks cleaner once I wiped down with the spray. The scent I definitely love though!! I have the lavender spray. Would buy again.
3,Good product,"Product does exactly as described - it covers odors on the mat. It does NOT eliminate odors - but for a quick pick me up, the mat will smell better. Still doesn't beat washing the mat."
3,Contents are grey. Only title is black.,I do not know why only the title is black. All other contents are grey which is hard to read on my kindle.Hope Amazon can fix it and update this book for free.
1,Strange story,I love all the other Little Bear books in her series but this one was strange. I'm sure that 30 years ago it wouldn't have seemed odd to tell your child a story about kisses being passed from one person to another but in today's age it just left a strange feeling with me esp at the part where the skunks kept kissing eachother back & forth. At least they get married at the end of the story. I took it back to the libray. Glad I didn't buy it. I own all the others she wrote however and love them.
5,Drive Brought Me Here... and I'm Staying!,"I discovered Desire via the Drive (movie) soundtrack and soon became addicted to listening to their music on ""the most popular streaming video site"". II is catchy, touching, melodic - I think I read someone call it ""electronic dance disco"" or something. IDK much or care much about music genres but whatever it is, I love it. If you're unsure, try Mirror Mirror, Under your Spell and Don't Call from said video site. If you can listen to Under your Spell (Album/Streaming Video version) without shivering at ""that"" part, you may have no soul...Wish Desire would release III.5/5"
2,Dry info about an interesting subject,This book was written by one of the best in the cardiac pacing field. The only problem is his dry and wordy compilation of cardiac pacing.
3,"Good, but could be better...","Of the two existing reviews here currently, you couldn't get much different responses. Ironically, I'm right in the middle. I'm not Kama'aina (native) to Hawaii, but Hawaii is my passion; I live, breath, and sleep it. Hawaii is a place to be respected and loved. So how does Hawaii magazine handle that task?Well, I guess it depends on what you're looking for. If you want the more tourist sided flavor to Hawaii, then the magazine probably will be what you enjoy. If you're looking for more native and eco-tourism based stuff, don't expect as much. Occasionally they'll put in pieces that aren't half bad on this topic, but it could be better. There recent anniversary editions were pretty good, but overall it still seems more like one big advertisement for tourists. Of course, that's where the money is, but you'd think a magazine called"
4,Interesting articles about Hawaii,Good informational articles on things to see and events that are happening in Hawaii. Articles and invent listing cover all islands within Hawaii.
1,Reggie the Recycler,"Okay - I'm upset at the Funk Doc. Up through Doc's Da Name 2000, Redman continued to reach up to higher levels with each of his releases. His beats and lyrics seemed to age like fine wine, improving with time. But with the unfortunate arrival of Malpractice, this has all changed for the worse. Now, we have a tired sounding Reggie Noble who for the first time in his career, has decided to recycle old samples and lyrics from past albums - and not only is this material stale, it's completely out of context with this album. And since when does Redman sample DMX - the very type of rapper who is the exact opposite of the underground (the underground that Redman was apparently content with being a part of in the past). In sum, this album is weak on all fronts. Especially the ... Casio keyboard beats. Reggie - get your a$$ back in the studio and start blazin some hot new [stuff], cuz this album only belongs in the ...."
3,Brenden Ballacchino,It seems as though with each Redman cd put out the quality of the cd decreases (exception method man redman cd). Redmans cds usually have awesome beats demonstarted in songs like time for some action and I'll be dat . This cd just contains no songs that you will want to listen to for years. Although songs like diggy doc and uh-huh are dicent with a few others. Its a dicent cd but it doesn't live up to what you expect from redman. I strongly suggest you but muddy waters and I'll be Dat first.
2,Even Redman himself said this album was wack,"The problem with this album was that it was too predictable (same song structure, same guest stars, etc.) and he made a poor choice for a first single (""Let's Get Dirty""). This helped make 2001 the year for Wack Rap Albums. For your next album, Red, tell producer Erick Sermon to step his game up (for once), and also, chill with those stupid radio skits; they're not funny anymore."
3,same beats,"When I purchased this album, I knew from the start that ithad at least a few good songs. ""Smash something"" is by farthe best track, but it's beats were used in nearly all thesongs in the album. What a waste."
3,"Hey Red, Next album: NO GUEST MCEES!!!","Redman can do so much better than this. If you need proof, listen to his last four albums. This album sounds too influenced by current rap trends. By the middle, it gets old. There are some definite classics, but as an album, this one is Red's worst."
4,Solid album,"I really enjoyed this album,Redman delivered a solid album but why 4 stars?It was too long and there were too many skits,also the song Dat B**ch was extremley weak and production and lyric terms so if that and all the skits except the rollercoaster ones were cut off it would've been a great album but too many stopped this album getting 5 stars which it might've if these were all cut off.Also you cant expect everyone to sit there for 80 minutes to listen to the whole album but standout tracks were:Lets Get DirtyDa Bulls**tReal N***azUh-HuhEnjoy Da Rideso my advice is if you're a Redman fan buy this but if you havent heard any of his albums buy Whut Thee or Blackout with Method Man first then this because mainly the Redman fans will enjoy this"
2,A tantalizing glimpse.,"The Spreadsheet was the application that made Personal Desktop computing a ""must have"" in the corporate and Government worlds. I know a bit about the history of its development. Of the spectacular rises, and equally explosive crashes. Of the breakthroughs and dead-ends. But this book seems to want to be an artistic triumph, rather than an informative record. 5 out of 5 for production values. 1 out of 5 for content. Read Wikipedia instead."
4,This cd is great!,"I realy like a good gheto r&b cd, and this is it. A preview of Bye Bye Baby is on it which was ok, but it stopped at the best part. Westside is a masterpice, TQ realy pulled togeather and did an awsome job on it. It also had some unique lyrics similar to Gangstas' Paradise. The background music is realy catchy, and has some good bass for those of us that simply live for a heavy bass song."
2,Doesn't work all that well,"It is now two days past the reversion of Daylight Savings Time and my watch has not been able to connect with the Ft. Collins transmitter to set the correct time.This is my second Oceanus watch. I had similar problems with the first watch but figured that maybe it was just a defective watch. I live on the Oregon Coast, well within the supposed range of the watch, but it does not receive the signal. For two nights I have left the watch on my windowsill hoping it would receive the correct signal but it has not.The only great thing about this watch is the crystal. I have had dozens of cheaper watches which get all scratched up in time. This crystal is excellent but right now I am having to subtract an hour to figure the correct time."
3,"Oh, this is sllloooooowwwww!","I'd really have liked this guy to have had a couple of cups of coffee or something before he did the disk. Great voice and the songs are good, tho depressing (mostly) and slow."
5,Classic Abbey,"Whisky, the horse is a key figure in this story of principle. It's about loyalty and perseverance. The ending wraps right around to the beginnning."
2,Disappointing,"After reading ""The Monkey Wrench Gang"" and his opus ""A Fool's Progress"", I was let down by this particular Abbey effort. The cliched character of Burns, the beleaguered cowboy, riding out of the purple-hazed past to rescue an old buddy from the perils of modern times, is shopworn at best. Abbey's prose, usually spectacular, just doesn't seem up to his standards here. Missing, too, were the pyrotechnic polemics that make Abbey so much fun to read. The ending was so thoroughly telegraphed, I felt slightly insulted. Avoid this book, and read ""A Fool's Progress"", Abbey at his finest."
1,A rather dull read,"From the back cover: Slocum has his hands full in boom-town L.A. with money-hungry bandits, knife-wielding pimps and gunslinging debtors on his back. Judge Boyer is filthy rich and willing to pay for protection--but Slocum's intincts tell him he's on the wrong side of the fence. A beautiful witness from the Rialto whorehouse and a prospersous family lead Slocum on a trail that stretches twenty years into the past.... his own!There's really not much going on in this Slocum. The plot and action are confined. I kept waiting for something to ""happen,"" but nothing really did. Repetive. Slocum, himself, seemed wimpy and overly-concerned. He even takes on the part of a spur-of-the-moment defense attorney, which I found unbelievable. Slocum is at his best when he's tough, a little self-centered, and down-right mean. None of that here. 187 pages. Not recommended. *"
3,"All that room, but still not enough","to stand up, if you are 6' or taller. We use our gear extensivley and our kids loved to room to play when it started raining, just wish it had more head room. It did leak at the zippers as a previous reviewer noted in their book, but overall we stayed pretty dry inside. Definitely need to use the guy ropes when the wind picked up, probably the same on any tent this size. Set up is cumbersome, and takes some time, but I'm sure after a few trys we'll get better at it. Overall, not the worst tent I've ever owned, but defintiely not the best either."
2,POOR ZIPPERS,THE ZIPPERS ON THIS TENT INCLUDING THE CARRYING BAG ARE POORLY DESIGNED.THEY ARE TOO SMALL AND WEAK FOR THE SIZE OF THIS TENT. THE ZIPPER BREAKS AND PULLS APART WITH TENSION ON IT.
1,use your head,"Giant tents may seem cool but the first windstorm or heavy rainfall will quicky crush your visions of ""taking the house with you."" Eureka or Kelty are probably where you should START your search and go up from there to some of the big boys ie North Face or even some REI tents. buy one good tent from real outdoor professional and enjoy for years...simple"
2,Big but doesn't hold up to normal use,"I have 5 kids and wanted a tent that would provide both floor space and walking space for adults. Columbia has always been associated with high quality gear in my mind so we splurged and went for the Gardner Peak. The first time out there was a thunder storm and the sides began to leak. The 2nd time out the zippers on the doors started to catch in the fabric due to what seems to be too much side to side tension across the top of the door. The 3rd time out one of the door zippers came apart and we had to duct tape the door shut. I also had a fiberglass pole split on trip #3 but I fixed it with a hose clamp and electrical tape. During the 5th trip out one of the elastic cords inside the spars broke, another fiberglass spar splintered and the other door zipper came off the track. In all, the $280 tent lasted 5 trips which is about the same cost as 5 nights in a cheap hotel. Not what I expected from Columbia. I'll be checking out other brands."
1,only ever got 1 issue for a 12 month subsription- ripoff,"I purchased a 12 month subscription/12 issues from this seller back in may of 2010. I only ever got 1 issue. Actually I completely forgot about the magazines until I got the electronic renewal noticeI contacted amazon via chant and asked for a refund. I was a bit surprised that they said no problem/that I was able to get a refund from Amazon even though it was 10 months later.So this isnt a complain about amazon, its a complaint about the seller. I should have checked further, they had a bad rep on the web as a ripoff artist.My advice - dont buy magazine subscriptions from this seller but Amazon is still a good company to do business with."
1,Find a better way to secure Ford logo,"This is the second Ford logo license plate frame I've purchased. I thought the problem we had with the first one was a once-in-a-life-time problem. I was wrong....it happened a second time after only a couple of weeks. The small Ford logo button or plates come off and, obviously, they are lost along the road somewhere. And, again, it looks tacky having one logo button missing."
1,Predictable & Boring.,"The artwork and design are the only real contributions. The content? Well, Leilah Wendell has enshrined herself in the glorified role of the messenger of a messenger. Amusing. Her divine identity, Na' Haliel (haliel is just Leilah spelled backwards), does not seem to offer much. And her soul-mate doesn't seem to have much to add. Also, to call this work the ""complete books of Azrael"" is misleading. You do not get the complete story... you get her complete story. I didn't pay for this book, and I don't think anyone else should have to. Take yourself out to the movies instead."
2,A Boat That Sinks?,"The first thing my daughter did with this toy was take the boat over to her wading pool and put the boat in the water. The boat sank right to the bottom because the directions note: ""not for use in water or sand.""What kind of boat cannot be used in water? I suggest dropping the wheels and motor from the boat and making a simple toy that floats. A floating boat could be used in the bathtub, pools, lakes etc.We are fans of the little people toy series but a sinking boat conveys a poor message and is not up the standard of the other toys in this series. For us water lovers, please make a boat that floats!"
4,The Way A Community Should Care,"After leaving his previous job as a minister in a rather glitzy church were being seen is more important then doing good, Sam Kinkade has settled into the town of Toms Brook, VA, the same setting as Richards previous book Wedding Ring. With many of the same characters, the author weaves a new story around the church and their new Sexton, Elisa Martinez, a refugee from Guatemala.Sam and his fellow parishioners have opened up La Casa Amarilla on the grounds of the church to act as an education program for the Hispanic children new to the area. But as the story progresses we see that everyone has a secret, including the pre-Cival War home that houses the school.With precise storytelling, Emilie Richards unwinds a wonderful addition to her Shenandoah Album series that brings the residents of Toms Brook into our homes and makes the reader a wonderful addition to the close knit community that cares for one another in a way that now seems foreign to most of us."
2,Political activism is the theme,"After reading Sister's Choice and loving it I thought I had found another author I could enjoy. Wrong. Endless Chain is a leftist leaning propaganda book about illegal immigrants and the mean-spirited townsfolk who want them gone. Sam, our hero, is an anti-goverment activist bent on reform. If he was a Catholic priest this would play out better. As a liberal (sex when engaged) pastor of a ""community"" church it falls flat. I bought 3 other Richard's books along with this one and now wish I hadn't. Endless Chain should be rated ""P"" for Propaganda."
3,"Complete, Yet Shallow...?","This is the second ""Unleashed"" Book that I have purchased, and I find them useful, but choppy. The chapters have different authors, and the continuity suffers from this treatment.Each chapter gives a complete overview of the subject it covers. The key phrase here is ""complete overview"", as the in-depth detail that many of the new features of FP 2000 has over its predecessors is not there.This is a good overview of FP 2000 for the intermediate user who has used other versions of FP. I would recommend that beginners or advanced users look elsewhere. If you are looking for detailed descriptions or examples of FP 2000's new features, look elsewhere. If you plan on using database integration, ASP, DHTML or CSS and you buy this book -- budget to buy at least one more book to cover these advanced features.In sum, I feel this is a good book for a book report about FP 2000 for a high school class; as a ""hands-on"" guide for real users, this book is not it."
5,30 Inch folding Round Table,My wife needed a good 30inch round table and after searching locally we couldn't find any that she liked. We found this one on Amazon and she is extremely happy with it. It was priced right and is more than adequately strong. We use ours as a night table with a cover and it is a definite keeper!
5,A spellbinding account of two great historic figures,"With artful and scientific detail, Mr. Salva has woven a compelling parallel between the lives of Lincoln and Lindburgh. It was easy to get engaged in the concepts presented and the accessible layout of the book. A supremely recommendable read! My main question for the author is - when is your next book coming out?"
2,No rhymes to be found,"Its actually a collection of short stories that are not at all popular. I bought this for a first time mom that wanted the short rhymes to read and be familiar with before her son is born. Very disappointed, but it would cost more to return than what I paid for it."
5,Just buy one,"If you are looking for a review about the national geographic, you have just arrived at the wrong place ! This magazine is so good you need to read no reviews. just buy one and the addiction will start right after !"
1,How long do you wait?,I purchased this National Geographic subscription for my husband in December and it is now February and I still have not received ONE issue? I would hesitate recommending 'signing up' for that reason.
4,Magnificent photos and facts,"I've never heard about about a magazine recieving a Nobel Prize -- even if the svedes are clever people. BUT IF it should happen, then National Geographic is on the top of my list. It might be a handfull to read this astonising accurate world of information, but you KNOW it's facts. This is journalism in mega-class. But the pictures is breathaking .. I've never -- ever -- seen anything as good as in the National Geographic; they are indeed in a class for them self. I've loved the protos here since before I could read -- and I never travel without a copy -- they should be awarded a Nobel Prize .. for .. i don't know .. something."
2,No news!,"I made a gift subscription for this magazine, National Geographic in December 2009. And am still wondering if the first copy has been delivered to the address.I can give a proper review only when i get a confirmation that the magazine has already been posted to the address!!!!"
2,"Love the mag, but not happy to get two issues that I've already read.","I love National Grographic. Great pictures, good stories. That isn't the cause of my two star review. The problem is the subscription service. For some reason, they sent me three issues all at one time: the current issue and two back issues! I already paid for the past two issues in the store, why are they sending the OLD magazines? I dont want 1/6th of my subscription to be something I already own."
5,Still loving it.,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. He remembers going through his grandparent's stacks and stacks of National Geographic. He was drawn in by the outstanding photography and always learned something new about subjects he didn't know he was interested in. The same is true now. This is a great magazine, I'm glad we are subscribers."
1,snail mail,"I ordered National Geographic and Reader's Digest for a gift from Amazon for my two brothers. That was two and a half months ago. They still haven't received either one. They have started receiving promotional mail from National Geographic so they are on the mailing list. How long should it take before the magazine will arrive? This seems like too long. It is nearly 3 months.I probably wouldn't order this again, unless a wanted to wait indefinitely for it to arrive."
3,National Geographic,"NG Mag usually holds my attention with mostly interesting articles. Some issues dwell too much on a single subject (that may be near and dear to us, like water).There used to be more short articles (Geographica).The magazine used to have more varied as well as more in-depth articles and pictures.Many articles have environmently ""slanted"" articles, instead of objective articles."
3,Not like it used to be few yrs ago,"Precisely two things have prompted me to subscribe to this once great,astonishing journal. 1st, at a very young age,i used to admire at the type of coverage,photos,quality of the paper etc of this book..so when i saw this offer of $10 for a yr's subscription, i jumped high up in the air as i thought i could relive my old days and also to show case the beauty of this to my 2yr son. but honestly, my son liked(the way i made and essayed him the stories out of the photos) it but i felt that it really did not live up to its once renowned reputation as there are too many pages of commercial ads( i can understand the need of it) with very less,little coverage.. however the quality of whatever was given were still good.finally, but for the more pages dedicated to ads, i still rate it good and might continue the next yr as well"
4,Great Magazine,"National Geographic is a great resource. The photography is top shelf, and there is a good balance of natural science, archaeology and history in every issue. The articles themselves can range from riveting to mildly interesting - and the writing isn't as good (generally) as some of the other available magazines out there.Having said that, it is a staple of learning, and I can say it first opened me up to a broader world 30 years ago as a kid - largely due to the pictures. Worth a subscription. You should, however, look at going direct to National Geographic - may get a better deal on the rate."
3,"Beautiful Photography & Maps, Articles Lacked Depth","As always the photography and the maps were beautiful. However, somehow my memory of the articles in years past was that they were more substantive than what they actually are. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, except to say that it seemed LITE and lacked weight. I could not get interested in it and that's why I chose not to renew the subscription after one year."
5,Still fantastic.,I've learned so much from this magazine. It takes you into cultures from all over the world and teaches you about them. Every month you're looking at pictures of events and people sometimes in places that you have never even heard of. Really educational and top notch.
5,an amazing magazine,"National Geographic continues to amaze me each and every month. The pictures and in depth articles are second to none. Simply, there is no equivalent to this monthly dose of adventure, environment and exploration.Kenneth Haft"
3,Not what it used to be. But get it for the kids.,"OK it is hard to knock National Geographic, because it is essentially in a league of it's own as it covers environment, geography, cultures, etc. However after 15 years of subscription it was time to move on. The magazine has become very americanized. And the recent overindulgence in 911 and Iraq was a real turn off. It is a big world out there, surely there was more happening. The magazine typically also has a lot of editorial banter in it's articles, rather than relating information. Anyhow the search for an alternative led me to the British CNN Traveler magazine to which I am now subscribed. A little more worldly with a diminished American perspective. Geo is also a good magazine, though not available in english. Geographical magazine didn't quite pique my interest. I still may buy an occasional National Geographic if I see a good issue on the magazine racks."
2,"2 month after, still no magazine","This is unbelievable, I put my order at Jun. 1 2010 and got canceled at Jul. by the reason of ""in error"". Then emailed Amazon to clarify the whole thing out. The only good thing is Amazon offered me a coupon to match my original price (without this, I'll grad it ""one star""). Right now, it is mid Aug., I still do not have my first issue yet. 2 and half months... Be careful guys."
5,Awesome Magazine!,"Great Magazine, with in depth articles covering interesting topics around the globe. I pity the fool who does not subscribe to NG"
2,Disappointed Because...,"I just rec'd the October issue, with one week left in the month. I would like the subscription to start with the November issue, not the the October at this late date. I have issues w/ the magazine itself."
5,Awesome Reading,"The pictures of National Geographic have always caught my attention, but after ordering for my wife, I had the privelege to take my time and read through the extensive information found in their articles and I was blown away. Incredible journalism goes into these magazines."
4,A real pleasure,"For varied interestes and reference material, they're invaluable. Our living room is was full of maginzes that I'd read over and over. The writing is wonderful, the photographs remarkable, and the varieyty of subject matter is staggering. Such a nice publication. I really look forward to buying a home so I can have the space to get a regular subscription. As a person with no artistic skills whatsoever, I really appreciate seeing the other side. I like ot collect Natinal Geographic magazines and really treasure them. I get tired of looking on the internet and an old fashion magazine is a nice break."
2,"Too many ""bells and whistles""","I downloaded the current trial magazine (which was >250 MB), hoping to start a subscription on my new Kindle Fire HD. Unfortunately, the subscription is so thick with features that it is hard to navigate smoothly. It is slow and cumbersome to respond; example: taking two swipes to turn a page or playing video and the sound is all that comes through. Pictures are beautiful but I don't want this frustration while trying to enjoy the magazine."
1,Very slow in recieving,I ordered the subscription on 11/24/09 Hope it only takes 4-6 weeks. Have two more weeks to go. Could have ordered it direct from NG and started it right away but was $10.00 more. It may turn out to be a better buy if I don't receive it...
3,Why would I want 3 issues all at the same time?,"I absolutely hate when a magazine chooses to send me multiple issues at the same time to start my subscription. I don't have time to get through 3 issues before the next one comes. I'm sure it's much more convenient for the publisher but in this day and age, their computers can easily keep track of when my subscription starts and ends. At this point, I am unlikely to renew this subscription because of this practice."
2,Avoid,"I bought the one year subscription (December 2011) but already receiving ""notices"" that my subscription is about to run out and that I need to renew (now only 6 months later). I don't get the magazines on time and one month never even got it!"
1,The NatGeo Marketing Arm Needs to Give Me a Break!,"If you like getting phone calls while you eat dinner, order National Geographic. While I was looking forward to the great photography, I regret ordering a subscription to NatGeo. Be warned, they will call you while you eat, to pitch ""we will you send you a free world map, and a video and if you choose to keep the video, we will only charge you $.$$""After a long day of answering phones at work, I don't want my home phone to ring. But NatGeo will call, they will call again, sometimes they'll just hang up on you, sometimes they'll pitch a product.With many print publications dying off due to the internet, it's amazing that NatGeo is driving customers away by becoming a 400 lb gorilla.And if they call my house again, I will cancel my subscription, take the loss and call it a lesson learned. (and then begin reporting to the no phone sales administration.Really sick of it."
1,One-year subscription but got only one issue,"Received only one issue for a one-year subscription, and nothing in the following three months.I contacted the customer service and was told that my subscription was canceled due to a system error. The refund will appear in one to two billing statements of my credit card (I hope).What if I didn't catch that error? Are they going to just take the money and do nothing? This is disgusting and dishonest. Never subscribe any magazine from them again.Update: never received that refund."
5,Nat'l Geographic,"I grew up with National Geographic and have always loved it! Whats not to love? Beautiful pictures, informative, educational articles and just a class act all the way around."
4,National eographic Magazine,"What can I say..it's National Geographic. Great stuff & it was processed much faster than normal magazine subscriptions,"
5,Very Happy,"My whole family loves this magazine. I thought it would take a long time to start arriving, but I was pleasantly surprised."
5,What a great gift,"My good friend gave me a subscription to NG as a gift--and what a wonderful idea it was! Of course I've been long familiar with it, and always picked it up in a doctor's lobby or in a train station waiting room, but having my own issues to pore over as long as I want is a real treat. Also, I frequently donate items I'm not using to Goodwill, Vietnam Veterans, and other organizations, and old issues of NG are the only old magazines these charities will take. They can still sell them, no matter the age. That's quite a testament to National Geo. The magazine is beautiful, enlightening, and wide-ranging in its topics and the photographs retain their world-class reputation. An outstanding gift idea."
3,Quality information,"I refer to National Georgraphic Mag Jan issue where they featured Singapore. I enjoyed reading the article about my country as I was from Singapore and felt that the writer has captured the essence of Singapore very well.However, I was disappointed with the photos portraying Singapore. The Pictures do not represent the modern, hi-tech and ""man-made"" beauty of the gardens and the structures of the island as it should. Instead, it has pictures that were just showing Asian faces or of landscape that made Singapore feel like it was back in the 60s.This warped visual view of Singapore does not potray the Singapore of today."
5,National Geographic,This was a gift to my Son-in-law. He enjoys it very much.I have given it to him for Christmas for several years.
5,Beautiful and worth every dollar!,The reviews on this website attest to the value and beauty of this magazine. I recently subscribed to NG and regret that I did not do so earlier.
3,Received the first 3 issues at the same time,Received the first 3 issues in the mail at the same time. Will be interesting to see how the next issue come.
2,Have not received the magazine yet.,"Its been a month, and I do not think magazine subscriptions get started in that time. Need to wait for a few more weeks to evaluate."
3,Great Magazine,"I've read National Geographic since I was a little. I always enjoyed the wonderful photography in the magazine, and I have to admit, that's still the part of the magazine that I enjoy the most. Oh, I read the articles once in a while, but many of them have a liberal slant on them that I don't appreciate. Still despite that, the stories are usally well written and the pictures remain outstanding."
1,Having a Problem Changing Billing Address,I ordered this magazine for my son on 6/22/08. He has yet to receive his first issue and now has a new address. I'm having a terrible time trying to correct the shipping address.
5,Love it.,I ordered this for my husband who was reading it in a doctor's office. Had forgotten what an interesting magazine it is.
3,"Great Magazine, Poor Amazon Service","National Geographic is a great magazine, but after purchasing it through Amazon because of a discount they gave me, they inexplicably canceled the transaction claiming something went wrong. They asked me to reorder, but I'm not sure I want to go through the hassle."
2,Warning: They will send you back issues you may not want,"Okay, the magazine itself is great. But be warned: when you order it, you will receive several back issues that you may very well already have purchased. I ordered it and received the new March issue plus the old January and February issues that I already have. I'll try to call them tomorrow to fix it, but what a pain. I would guess it is because they have lots of old unsold issues lying around anyway.National Geographic has a great magazine and some good documentaries, but their business side is awful. Such a stupid move to send me old issues. It just makes me really dislike the whole thing."
1,bad service... don't buy!,"The magazine itself is outstanding. But the service is bad. Early this year, they missed sending me one issue. I called them, emailed them, filled form to them. Then they emailed me saying that they will issue me the missed issue... But it never comes!!! Can't they just keep their words??For all the effects I have put on handling this, I will never order it again."
2,Natgeo suffering from global warming.,"Haven't really read the magazine for 20 years or more, but I was very impressed by some of the offerings on their cable t.v. channel, and equally impressed by amazon's fine subscription deal. Frankly, the issues I've received are very disappointing. Not just because they blindly follow the new style of news magazines (glitzy but shallow), but also their voluminous advertising. The issues are much slimmer and less technical than those of older volumes, the maps less informing, and everything touched with sensationalism. In short, they've become ""big business"", and when the subscription expires, that will be it for at least another 20 years.In short, National Graphic has regrettably shifted its focus from its journal to its films. Which is great for the films, of course; but lamentable for the magazine's quality."
4,Only one problem,"I love NG Magazine so I decided to take out a subscription (which saves a lot of money) the one complaint I have is how they sent my first shippment. I subscribed in september and they said it would ship in 10-12 weeks. So i continued to but the current issues as they were released. In december when they sent my forst shippment they sent oct, nov, and dec all at once, I didnt care for that. Any other mag that I get starts from the first actual month that they ship"
4,National Geographic,It a great magazine. I saw and learned things that I didn't know that was going on in the world it was worth the money
5,The Best,We love National Geographic. It is so interesting and includes beautiful photography. We re huge fans and the entire family enjoys it.
3,Magazine Great - Fulfillment not so much,Ordered magazine -- didn't come for several weeks. Then 3 months came on the same day. Kind of defeats the monthly nature of the periodical.
5,Great Magazine,We love it and pass it on to my parents who pass it on to my brother- in -law who gives it to my sister to take to school.
3,"Great photos, Liberal agenda driven contents","I have been a subscriber to National Geographic since mid 1990s when I was back in Iran. I remember receiving this good magazine with pictures being marked or censored by postal authorities in Islamic Iran yet I loved it. However, this magazine has really lost its once proud tradition of presenting fair and true scientific contents and has replaced it with some liberal agenda driven stuff like promoting nonsense like global warming, world peace and getting anti-U.S rhetoric/politics involved when writing about other nations like their past issue that was dedicated to Iran. All in all, this magazine is good in terms of first rate photographies. 3/5"
2,"Unable to review, has not been recieved yet, was ordered on June 30th, 08","This magazine was ordered on June 30th, my Son has not recieved it yet???????? So can not comment on a review at this time."
1,Complain about the efficiency,Actually I have not received this magazine yet. Could you please help me to check it? Thanks.
3,International Geographic,"After a 30-year subscription to National Geographic our family decided not to renew for 2002. Though the photos are outstanding and stories worthy, it has become ""International"" Geographic, with very little content regarding the beauty of the United States. An entire year has passed without an article that contained a homeland flavor."
5,The World Around Us,"This magazine has been around for over 100 years, and with the high quality of the paper, the photograhs, and the content it could likely be around for another 100 years. I am amazed each month opening the latest issue to learn about topics ranging from Arctic Alaska, to Egyptian Mummys, to foriegn cultures and lifestyles. Lately, a favorite feature of mine has been the monthly zip-code piece. The magazine takes an in-depth look at a zip-code in the United States. I gain a deeper appreciation for my world through this subscription."
5,NG a GREAT deal!,Just received the first copy National Geographic magazine of my subscription. It delivered excellence in photography and articles as promised. Don't know why I've never been a subscriber. Amazon's deal beat all other the internet discounts I viewed.
4,Still waiting for my 1st arrival - updated 05/07/2011,"I placed the order since Amazon had such a great promotional cost. However...I ordered on 03/27/2011, got charged by Amazon on 03/28/2011, but yet have not received any magazines as of 04/28/2011. A lot of people complaint going through Amazon takes 2 months to process. Others complaint the they receive a few back orders all at once. I haven't received my order yet, but I'm expecting the worst at this time.I will update this e-mail should my order finally get processed.05/07/2011 UpdateI have to take my words back. So far, I have received my 1st magazine around 05/02/2011 and it's the May issue. I haven't received any older issues.Also, @Schmidt, I am aware of the 6-10 weeks waiting when I placed the order. I just don't see the reason why it takes that long.Anyhow, everything is so far so good."
5,Constant Companion,I cannot remember a time that this magazine hasn't been in my life. My grandmother send a subscription to my dad every year; and when I moved away from home he sent it to me. Now that my parents have passed away I buy it for myself. Growing up I probably compiled at least a dozen school reports from the many articles I have read. When it comes in the mail I stop everything and read it cover to cover. My only possible negative critique would be that the magazine has become more political over the years; and I enjoy the true science of exploration and can get the politics elsewhere.
1,The vendor refused to honor the $15 subscripton request.,The vendor refused to honor the $15 subscripton request.I tried previosly when it was $10 with the same result.Good Luck to you.
1,Cheaper price for this magazine,$15 for a year's subscription at the national geographic mag site. Go there and buy it. One star for Amazon trying to get you to shell out the extra dough.-Karl
3,Nor what it used to be,"In my humble opinion National Geographic is justa shadow of the once great magazine it once was.I had the unfortunate experience of dealing withThe NG staff trying to turn off the repetitive andPersistent renewal notices and encountered aBunch of bureaucratic morons. It is a shameThere is no longer integrity in the managementof the the magazine. Remember, you asked ."
1,Wouldn't know,"I ordered this loong time ago, still have not received it. But when I had it years ago, it was a very interesting read."
4,national geographic,I just got my first 2 issues and I can't put them down. I love the tv program but the magazine is awesome.
4,"Great pictures, forgettable text","I love the pictures in this magazine. However, sometimes the articles are forgettable. I'd recommend the magazine if you really like to appreciate photography. (Also, frankly, most of the articles and pictures are available for free online.)"
4,Midwest Living,I only received 1 magazine so far.So far so good.I am looking forward to reading the other ones.
2,Not a Southern Living or a DownEast,Compared to the two magazines on the subject line this one is lacking content. One has style and the other is more culture related. This magazine misses the mark and I am not sure what the overall impact is suppose to be.
3,country meets urban eclectic,This is not quite what I had expected. It is good in showing new design ideas for a country home (?). I have to admit even I couldn't stand to see one more blue duck unless it is on a pond. So unique is not all bad it is just far enough off the beat'n path for me not to get a lot out of it.
1,"Don't order this from Amazon, order somewhere else","Ordered in October, told to expect the first issue to come in January--that's slow even by magazine standards (and beyond the 6-10 week estimate as well).Part of this is due to the 6 issues/year publication cycle, but like I said, it is well outside the 6-10 week estimate given by Amazon, which is unfortunate."
2,Still have not received and customer service has not been good,"Although it should have started, I still have not had any communication and my order name only cameonline this week. Another magazine I ordered here at the same time has already begun. Sent email toMidwest Living, still no response"
2,"Sometimes good, often bitter",I must agree with other reviewers that this coffee is sometimes bitter with a strange taste that I haven't noticed in other amaretto flavored coffee.
1,Strange Smell/ Taste,"I was excited when this package arrived, but very disappointed the next morning. This coffee has a strange chemical taste/smell and is undrinkable. I now have four bags I can't use...not happy!"
3,Facinating Subject - Mediocre Quality,"Most of this video is from home movies taken at the 1939 World's Fair. If you find the subject interesting you should consider this video. There is something about a film/video that greatly enhances one's experience that still photographs cannot.The film is narrated by Jason Robards, who does a good job describing his experiences when he attented the Fair. It delves into the Fair's history, exhibits, and the relevance of the fair to pre-war US.The print leaves a lot to be desired however. I cannot ascertain whether the video has been copied too many times or if the film had deteriorated when it was transfered. Sometimes details are hard to make out and the color bleeding is bad. Al in all I recommend it with a caveat."
1,Greek Denial of the Macedonian Name,"The most important thing to remember about the ""Macedonian conflict"" is that the Greek position has changed dramatically over the past decade. Official Greek government policy was that Macedonia did not exist. When Greece took over Aegean Macedonia in 1913, they killed, tortured and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of Macedonians. They changed the names of people, villages, and landmarks from Macedonian to Greek in their attempts to eradicate the Macedonian name. Two things to remember:1. It is ironic that Greeks now ""love Macedonia"" when they tried to eradicate its very existence.2. If Macedonia has always been Greek, why did the Greek government deny its existence until the 1980's?"
5,The story of today's Macedonia,"John Shea's book is an easy to read, concise analysis of the political situation in Macedonia. John Shea analyses the relationship between Macedonia and Greece from earliest times to today and how that relationship affects the complicated politics currently affecting the two nations.The book details Macedonia's current position from the perspective of the Macedonian's. It provides a great insight into the current issues facing Macedonia (externally and internally). It is quite clear that Macedonia faces significant cultural hostility from its neighbours (as can be observed from some of the other reviews on this book).I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone interested in a macedonian viewpoint on today's Macedonia."
5,interesting in history????,"Not only to the macedonian people but to any who would like to have a better understanding about the history of ""Macedonia and its people"" but also to understand the ""Balkans"" and its history. Thanks Mr. Shea for writting this book for ""me"" too to understand better my people, culture, language, and also about its neighbours influence to the Macedonia then and now. Question, how much more information that ""greeks"" they need to see the truth and to accept ""Macedonia"" is ""Macedonia for Macedonian people"". thank you"
1,THAT HELLENIC HISTORY REALLY HURTS!!!!,"IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THE MULTINATIONAL MINORITY NATION OF AMERICA WHICH IS TRYING TO ""WRITE"" ITS HISTORYTO ACCEPT THE GLORIOUS HELLENIC HISTORY INCLUDING THE MACEDONIAN ERA.THERE WE GO WE HAVE THIS TRASH-BOOK THAT ONLY REVEALS THE AMERICAN DESPAIR."
1,Macedonia will always be a part of Greece,"The people of Skopie are brainwashed!! 60 years after Tito they still think their Macedonians. Sad, truly sad."
4,Wonderful Book,"As a child of the 80's i had wondered what happened to Tony. He has the most amazing voice! This is a great book. It shows their struggles, fame and then greed of certain band members that almost got Tony but looks like he is prevailing....by the way Gary who? Looks like Tony is rising above it all."
5,My Favorite Singer,"This book is really well written, so far, I am about halfway through. It's funny and poignant. I love reading about his childhood, how he started singing and his family. So many people in his industry who come from humble beginnings go on to do great things. I love Tony's voice but I think he also has a future in writing. I hope he'll give it another go. Thank you."
3,Didn't work as well as my other stuff does...,"I picked this up the other day because I wanted something that would not only open up my nasal passages, but would also help reduce my fever, cough & other symptoms. While it did help open my nose up more (making it run more so it could clear out), it didn't really do anything for any of my other symptoms.The box claims that it helps with ""Fever & Minor Aches & Pains"", but in truth I didn't really feel that it really helped with any of that. Other than helping make my nose run like a faucet, it didn't really do much of anything else. For the price I paid for it, I just didn't really feel like I'd gotten my value over the store brand of Sudafed."
2,"the ultimate face, scalp, neck & shoulder massage","Tell you the truth, I was dissipointed whole technic this guy showed. If you want to learn head and scalp massage, I suggest to try local beauty salon."
4,Easy access to Out of Print Material,"I found the product to be as according to the description, the CD has software that installs on your computer and provides searching capability for the CD. I have not been able to use the CD more than once but look forward to doing so. The only down side to my view is that software is installed on the computer to do its functions."
5,Great books!,"I love these books because they have unicorns,action and a little bit of romance (who dosn't love those things?)! I find the main part of the story too short, though. The only other remotely bad thing about these books is how to find them for cheap but still in good condition."
3,Taking flight,"Debut LP wasn't quite up to the polished personality they would evolve into but was certainly enough to warrant further investigation. It turned out this one of the rare heavy bands who mostly spoke in a musical language I detest, but actually have something melodically to say about it."
4,"dark, driving, instrumental music",Pelican's Australaisa is a masterful balance of dark and dreary soundscapes with just the right ammount of melodic hopefulness. Australasia drags the listener through sludgey mires of sonic excesses and self-indulgent grooves and ends up on the beautiful sunlit shores where the listener overcomes the darkness and welcomes the warmth of the sun This album is one of the most powerful and moody instrumental releases ever.If you like this album you should check out their 2005 release The Fire in Our Throats will Beckon the Thaw as well as their self titled debut.
3,Good pic's - not enough ofthem.,"On first glance this appeared to be a good photo printer. And, in fact, the photos printed were of very good quality. The downside is that after printing 6 or 7 photos (4"" x 6"") the print cartridge was empty! I also could not get the printer to read the photos stored on my Smart Card taken from a new Nikon Cool Pix camera (cards from Canon digital cameras worked with no problem). Bottom line - I returned the Kodak printer and bought an HP."
1,No good here either...,"I received this as a gift, I hate to think what was spent for it. The photo paper will not feed through the printer. I have never been able to use it...Kodak said they will try to fix it but they want to charge my credit card $100 just to look at it and I am must pay shipping and handling both ways."
4,memory card is stuck,so i bought this photo printer and i put in my memory card which is quite small compared to the insertion slot. it worked and everything but how do i get the card out? its stuck and there is no eject button that i can find. please help.
2,Review of Kodak Easy Share Photo Printer 500,"Quite a bit heavier than i thought this size printer would be, so not as handy for traveling with. Also the paper feed doesn't want to route the paper through unless it is a full tray, so you have to bolster the tray to make it flow.Switching from printing one photo per page to several per page is a bit tricky.I had planned on taking this printer on vacations with me to use as references to paint from, but because of it's weight won't be doing that.i would not buy this product again."
2,BEWARE - There's a problem somewhere!,"We bought this printer at Christmas and the first had a blank screen (software problem). We returned it to Best Buy, no problem. We enjoyed the new one for 9 months, and now we are having to shipped it to service at our expense with the exact same problem. I am currently reviewing camcorders and are finding reviews very informative. Please take ours to heart."
4,GREAT KIDS MOVIE. 14th dec 2004.,"I wouldn't say this movie is boring, there's a lot going on so the film is quite good. The ACTORS in the movie were great such as DAKOTA FANNING who played sally, and MIKE MYERS who played the cat. THE colors and scenes are terrific, great for young kids also. It isn't an adult type of film but it is quite an enjoyable film for some teens. The effects around the house have made it better and the magical cars etc in which aremade for the setting. Worth hiring but i wouldn't buy it unless your sure."
3,"""It's a thing thing...you wouldn't understand""","Dr. Suess's Cat In The Hat isn't the best movie. How can you turn a kids book into a movie? Dr. Suess wasn't meant to be in a major movie productions. I thought the cartoon was much better. Yes, I am over the age of 13, but when I first watched the cartoon I wasn't.The movie does its best with the art style of Dr. Suess, but falls short on so many levels. I personally liked Mike Myers as the Cat."
1,More like The Crap In The Hat!,This movie is so horrible. Any remaining copies for sale need to be destroyed! Anyone who buys this (VHS OR DVD) needs to be commited.
3,"Funny, in a simpsons kind of way","Up until now I had avoided this movie like the plague. It was aweful (said just about everybody). So, with the lowest of expectations, I gave in and gave it a try.Boy was I wrong! This movie was hilarious! I think a kid will enjoy this movie for all the zany sounds and hyper-activity, but I really don't think they'll ""get-it"". Kind of like the simpsons. Kids can laugh at Homer getting a plunger stuck on his face, but to really get the jokes, to really appreciate them, to see the dark subtle humor, you have to be an adult. So, although kids will laugh, only the adults truely understand the jokes, and the adults will laugh, I laughed very VERY hard at times.Sure, sometimes it was just plain stupid, but that made it funny also! Like there wasn't anything that just wasn't plain stupid in the Ace Ventura movies? But they were hilariously stupid!People, lighten up. You can't tell me you hated the entire thing? Geez."
3,Better than the Grinch,"The Cat in the Hat was better than The Grinch. The Cat in the Hat was more funnier and clever than the Grinch.Mike Myers stars as The Cat in the Hat that arrives in Sally and Conrad's house to have fun, But the fun dosen't look fun after Conrad opens the box that turns their house into The Cat's world, also Lawrence Quinn decides to send Conrad to boot camp.trouble starts when the Cat messes up their house,Thing 1 and 2 mess up the house worser than before. The Cat most help to clean the house. the jokes and adult humor wasn't for children because the humor was more adult than kid humor.this is more for 10-15 year old's."
1,Do not waste your money,"Before I saw this movie, I was excited about it too. We bought the DVD as my 5-year-old daughter's birthday present. It turned out to be a biggest disappointment. The acting was not funny but violent. Most of the humor are not suitable for children. We also found the humiliation towards the asian people (or government) unnecessary. What I really want to know is when they made this movie, do they have children in mind? If you love Dr. Seuss, read the book. Don't waste money on the movie. Don't even rent it. It will do more harm to your kids than good."
2,Too adult for most children,"I can't count how many times I fought the urge to walk out of this movie. I took my 4 year old to see it, and was relieved that he was young enough to enjoy the silliness, yet too young to understand much of the humor aimed at adults. The level of poor taste demonstrated in including such allusions in a movie clearly marketed to children was appalling. Save your money and rent How the Grinch Stole Christmas if your taste for Seuss needs quenching."
1,"NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS!!! SEX JOKES, PROFANITY,SIMULATED N","THE GRINCH MUST HAVE WRITTEN IT, AS IT IS FULL OF SEX JOKES, SIMULATED NUDITY AND BARELY BLEEPED OUT PROFANITY. THE ACTING IS THE WORST YOU WILL EVER SEE. MIKE MYERS IS DOING A DEAD ON IMPRESSION OF THE COWARDLY LION, BUT IS WASTED HERE. DAKOTA'S ACTING IS GREAT BUT SHE IS WORKING IN A VACUME. THE FILMMAKER'S MUST HATE KIDS AS IT IS WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE FOR THEM. IT IS NOWHERE NEAR THE QUALITY OF THE GRINCH WHICH WAS NO MASTERPIECE.THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS TERRIBLE, WITH THE ACTORS ALWAYS DEAD CENTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PICTURE.WHAT A MEANSPIRITED TREATMENT OF THE MATERIAL. NO LAUGHS HERE EITHER."
1,"Horrible, Evil and an insult to Dr. Suess","Who in his/her right mind in Hollywood greenlighted this barf?? Sure, it probably sounded like a good idea at first but this is causing Dr. Suess to spin even faster in his grave (The Grinch started his gyrations)!Mike Myers tells stupid ""Austin Powers"" toilet jokes, The supposedly magical Cat character uses credit cards and there are a billion ""product placements""/commercials in this dreck. Why is Alec Baldwin in this and why was his character necessary? Hollywood producers took a pure, honest concept and turn it into a 90 minute commercial for consumerism and craziness. This sewage is worse than a arsenic laced martini!Don't be sheep, go see a real movie."
1,"Stay away, its worse than they say it is.","Horrible, and really frightening version of the book that will give you nightmares on how bad it is. Mike Myers should be beaten senseless for what he did to the cat, and everybody who made it should be arrested for public drunkenness because only a person with enough alcohol could makes this film as bad as it is. Are my words too strong for you? Yes, but after you see this mess, you would think that I'm being too kind."
1,"Very, very bad","This movie, billed for children, is full of nudity, sexual jokes and rude situations. The acting is bad and, except for the computer generated fish, the special effects aren't that special. I think another reviewer below said this: they should have made the whole movie on a computer like Toy Story and Shrek. The people who made this movie have the same type of shock humor mentality that permeates most TV comedies now-a-day. No cleverness and no creativity in the script. Dr. Suess is probably rolling in his grave. This movie is several pegs down from the Grinch (which was full of bodily function humor and not much else). Bad writing, bad acting and and a misguided idea of what a childrens movie should be make for a kids movies that kids should be kept from."
1,"For money, not for love","This movie has already made millions of dollars on the hype alone, and it's a shame. Hollywood should not be endlessly rewarded for putting this stuff out, and it must stop here. Please, do not go and spend money to see this film. As they did with the Grinch, Hollywood took a sweet, fun, silly book for kids by Dr. Seuss and turned it into a cynical, bloated, crude piece of dirt for adults - the kind of adults who like cynical, bloated, and crude. It ain't Mike Myers' fault, it's the writers and producers with the crass belief that anything with enough hype behind it will make money. This belief must be challenged. I hope they make a lot less than they expected they would on this one."
3,Worth the matinee,I took my 2 1/2 year old daughter to see this as I thought she would enjoy the colors and liveliness of the characters. She loved this movie. She was totally entralled as was all the other children I witnessed watching it in the theater. This movie does not have much in it that would appeal to adults but for kids maybe under 12. It does have some reminiscent scenes that remind you of Dr. Evil and Fat B****** because of the accent. It's not how I probably would have adapted the book but it was a fun movie anyway. If you decide to watch this movie just keep in mind the age group it was made for.
5,Greatest movie ever,This was such a GREAT movie. Most reviews I have read have just completely missed the whole point. Mike Meyers was amazing and the characters of the two children and mother just added to the fun. The family is supossed to be perfect but the boy in the family always does the opposite of what he is told. A nearby neighbor tries to send the boy to Military school but turns out to be a ... and awful man. Great movie thats all i can say!!
1,Mike Myers Must Have Needed Some Money,"This is a poor adaptation of a favorite childrens book. How could some of the effects be good, and then the cat effects just suck? The entire script is contrite. This is a disgrace to a brilliant writer. Let's hope that next time crap like this doesn't see the light of day."
4,"I admit, we're a different bunch over here","I think most people absolutely hated this movie, but if you have a quirky, offbeat style, this one's not bad. My 6 yr old son has that kind of humor, and really thinks this is a funny movie. Truthfully, it has almost no connection to the Cat in the Hat books, and I guess I understand the reaction by most viewers. Take it with a grain of salt and be flexible, and you'll find yourself chuckling throughout the movie."
1,Pathetic,"Another Dr. Seuss classic ruined. Why does Hollywood feel like they have to screw up everything? They take a wonderful story and turn it into a flaming pile of commercial dog poo. Even with the horrible reviews this movie is getting, it's making some big box office bank. Undoubtedly, they will mess up another Dr. Seuss story. It's unfair."
2,Save your money... take your kids to the mantinee,"First of all, I loved The Grinch. But, no doubt about it, The Cat in the Hat will not impress the older Dr. Seuss fans. There was no story and it seemed to butcher the original Cat in the Hat book. Mike Meyers was HORRIBLE... his worst performance EVER!!! He wasn`t funny at all. In fact, I didn`t laugh once throughout this movie.However, my 7-year-old son did enjoy this movie. The set was fantastic in creating a Dr. Seuss world. The colors were vibrant and fun. These are the only good things I can think of. So, take the little ones! They won`t be as picky as me."
2,"MORE ""AUSTIN POWERS"" THAN DR. SEUSS!!","Not for kids!! it has been stated before - in other reviews, but let me reiterate it here NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS!!! This movie is anti-kid friendly and Michael Myers is more like Austin-Powers in his level of vulgarity and vileness than the Dr. Seuss chraacter his is SUPPOSED To be portraying!! I mistakenly bought this thinking it was Jim Carey, after just watching his version of the Grinch (an excellent movie by the way) The movie is not entirely bad - but as far as I can remember, it does not follow the book - and is aimed at a mature audience as many of the jokes kids will not get. I hate to give any movie a thumbs down, but this movie surely deserves one."
1,Belongs in a Litter-Box!,"When I watched this stinker, I felt like sniffing it and covering it up.This is just another attempt to cash in on nostalgia. Obviously the producers of the film were aiming at parents fond memories of the Dr. Seuss classic childrens book and tried to exploit it into an updated version. It fails miserably. It is another example of Hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script. Dont get me wrong, this movie looks great. It has awesome costumes and set design but the problem is, it seems like they whipped the screenplay out in 20 minutes. Even the kids think this movie stinks.Do your child a favor, avoid this film and instead sit down and read your child the original book. They will appreciate it way more."
1,Absolutely Awful,"It's hard to understand how so many talented people can spend so much time, effort and money to create such a bad movie. No only was it not funny, it wasn't even fun. The sets and costumes are pretty good, but that's about it. The best character was the fish, but we only get to see him occasionally.The crude humor was entirely inappropriate for a film based on a Dr. Suess book and billed as a something for kids. Can't Mike Meyers at least try to be funny without resorting to toilet humor and innuendo?This movie is like a really bad, boring cartoon. It's too bad they didn't do better."
2,Not the classic story,I must say I was dissapointed in this movie. Dr.Seuss books were my absolute favorites growing up- they probably were the reason I started to read. The movie had nothing to do with the story. The jokes were crude- but everything is now- the crude humor adult shows subject us too has now taken over children's shows. Mike Myers is wonderful in the role and the kids are very good too - but the austin powers type humor did not belong in this movie.
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.....got the movie and there were numbers running across the bottom of the screen. Most of the movie was skipped by it skipping thru parts and it was a gift that my child recieved for christmas from SANTA and they were crying....HORRIBLE service!
1,Worst Movie I have EVER seen!!!,"Worst movie... EVER. TOTALLY inappropriate for children. Disgrace to Dr. Seus. I just cannot say enough how AWFUL this movie is...it truly, truly is. Do not let your kids watch until you watch it first...it really is inappropriate."
4,People just need to lighten up.,"I don't know what's with all these one star reviews, but it seems that most are complaining about the poor acting, lack of plot, and overall bastardization of the original book...which I am not doubting or arguing against. But c'mon! It is a kid's movie, not the Shawshank Redemption. I gave this movie 4 stars because my kid enjoyed it so much, which who the movie is actually for. I even have to admit, Mike Myers off the wall characterization of the cat had me laughing out loud a few times; a rare feat from this actor. He pretty much carries the entire movie on his shoulders. His silly antics in this movie even outdo his Austin Powers films that were so popular. The scene where he cuts off his own tail and when he makes himself a pinata are the best. I would recommend this movie for any family, it will have you jumping on the couch with your kids."
2,Quite Offensive,"When I saw the previews to the Cat In The Hat, I thought Wow This Should Be good. It has Mike Myers, Alex Baldwin, Kelly Preston, Sean Hayes, and Dakota Fanning in it. With a cast like that it must be good. I was wrong! The movie wasn't even funny! The little ones may find it funny, ages 8 and under. However, I did not. Also the movie is quite offensive! Whoever wrote the lines for this movie should of been fired! The movie has some sex-related quotes in it and the movie is Rated PG! The only cons about this movie is that it had a great cast and it had dazzling special effects! So if your a fan of one of the cast members then go rent it! Otherwise avoid it!"
2,INAPPROPRIATE for KIDS,"I just finished watching this movie and I must say it is not suitable for children. The movie is filled with lame jokes that center around swear words and sexual slang. Personally, I laughed once every ten times a joke was told.This movie looked really nice with the vivid colours and imaginitive sets but it fell flat because of a very thin plot. It seemed to me that this movie tried to appeal to kids and adults alike but it didn't fly. Not entertaining enough for adults and not appropriate enough for kids."
2,Review,"As entertainment , Cat In The Hat is barely so-so. It aims at easy targets. And it barks when it ought to purr. Really, you shouldn't have to add burps, farts, and dog pee to Dr.Seuss. If directing bad movies were a sin to confess, Bo Welch would say oops for making this mess. The movie works so hard to achieve a sense of whimsy that you feel exhausted long before it's over. It's a vulgar, uninspired lump of poisioned eye candy. I recommend not seeing this movie at all."
1,"SERIOUSLY, DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS...","Warning. Do NOT take your little kids to this movie. Their beloved Cat in the Hat is turned into a really gross character here. Mike Myers seems to be doing a Jim Carey/Bert Larh (Cowardly Lion) imitation and it doesn't work. The audience has to sit through flatulence and sexual jokes that aren't at all appropriate for a kiddie flick. The worst moment comes when the Cat gets aroused over a picture of Sally and Conrad's mom as he unfolds her picture like it's a centerfold magazine spread. Will someone please tell these movie makers that it's not appropriate to have adult content in a children movies? I've had it! The Cat in the Hat could have been great. It has fantastic special effects, great costumes and it's even funny at times. However, I can NOT recommend it if you're planning on bringing the children along with you."
1,"Dreadful, dirty humor--not a kid's movie","This was an awful movie. Mike Myers performance was way over the top and not at all funny. Some of his jokes were obscene and I was shocked these were included in a kid's movie. Fortunately my 6 yr old son seemed not to understand too many of these. I just groaned in my seat as the film pressed on. The only highlights in this dismal movie were Alec Baldwin's performance and Thing One and Thing Two dashing about the house an impersonating police officers. In addition, the story poorly resembled the book. I don't think you can do a film much worse than this. What were they thinking of????????"
5,4 yr old Granddaughter Loves this Movie,We bougth this movie for our Grandson but our 4 year old Granddaughter loved it so much she wore the DVD out and we just ordered a new one for her birthday! This is the only movie that can entertain her for 90 minutes!
1,Not going to show this to my kids.,"I was disappointed in hearing what Mike Myers had done to the lines of The Cat In the Hat. In Shrek, he was great. But I simply cannot show this to my nephew and try to explain to him that ""Chocca Locca"" is X rated.I would recommend instead to see Jim Carrey in The Grinch. Not only does he play the perfect Grinch, if he knows the movie is aimed towards a children audience, he will not do certain things in a movie. He will refuse to do so. The Grinch was lengthened a bit, but I loved it, and they kept to the book in some of the scenes, which is also admirable.Sadly, because of what was done to The Cat in the Hat, no other Dr. Seuss books will be put into movies, which is a shame.If you want the Cat in the Hat, stick to the book. This movie goes far beyond what Dr Seuss would have ever wanted. :("
1,a sad film............................,THIS MOVIE IS STUPID IT ISN'T FUNNY IT'S JUST RUDE DON'T EVER BUY THIS YOU'LL JUST PUKE I DEFINATELY WAS GOING TO!!!!!!!!! IT ISN'T GOOD AT ALL IT WAS PROBABLY MADE BY A BUNCH OF COWS MIKE MYERS'S ACTING IN THIS IS STUPID THE COWS WHO MADE THIS FILM PROBABLY HAD TO FORCE HIM TO DO IT HE REALLY DID A BAD JOB OF ACTING ON THIS!!!!!!!! THE FILM MAKERS SHOULD BE SUED FOR MAKING THIS JUNK AND THE CAST FOR DARING TO BE IN THIS IT'S THE WORST MOVIE EVER AND WILL REMAIN THAT WAY!!!!!!!!!!!! = : (
2,DVD Cheapness?,"hey i just bought this movie for my little sister. i open the case and theres not so much as even a booklet inside, just the disc. i bought it brand new so what gives? anyone else missin the booklet or did the store screw me? anyways, the movie itself is ok. nothing to go crazy about but it does have some moments."
5,would have been funnier if Jim Carrey was the Cat,"where was Jim Carrey when they filmed this movie? it would have been a lot more funnier. Mike Myers is good at some things, but Jim Carrey would have been a better cat. it starts out with the the threat of Conrad getting sent off to military school, but at the end, Joan dumps her boyfriend for even thinking it. it wasn't that way in the cartoon, but that's Hollywood for you."
2,Dr. Suess would be ashamed,"Dissapointing. Extremely dissapointing. I was very surprised, though, that they took such a well known, favorite story and turned it into a nightmare. It was nothing I had expected. Very rude humor. I was upset by how much they made it look like a kid movie. Don't waste your time on this one. It's not worth it. Go see the original ""The Cat in the Hat"" or read the book."
1,Just Plain Stupid,"The acting was bad, the script was worse. The jokes were not funny crude or not. The special effects in any Ed Wood movie were better. If you want to see a desicration of a classic children's book this is the movie for you. If you want a laugh or two look elsewhere.This was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen, and yes I have seen Gigli!!!!"
1,absolutely awful,"The Cat in the Hat is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. The script is in no way interesting or creative. All the hype of the movie made many characters who had micro parts seem like they had major roles. Mike Myers is not funny at all. The entire movie seems to be like one big deleted improv scene that would be contained on the DVD as an extra feature. I am beginning to realize that Mike Myers plays the same character in every movie. Like in View From The Top, his talent does not show in this movie. It made me feel no emotion whatsoever. Awful cast. Awful script. Awful direction. Just plain awful. NOT worth the price of a movie ticket. I don't even think it's worth the price to rent."
2,So sad.,"I thought this was going to be so much better than what it really was. They took all the scenes that should have been in the movie and deleted them. I only laughed one time throughout the entire film. This is worth skipping, you'll be left beating yourself up for spending money on it."
3,This Should Be Rated PG-13 instead of PG!,This Movie was pretty funny at times. The story wasn't much like the book but it was okay. The humor is funny at times and appropriate but other times its really insulting! This movie should of been Rated PG-13 or they should of toking out those inappropriate and insulting jokes said by Mike Myers. I still liked this movie. However kids under 11 should not see this movie!
5,Great stuff!,"Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people."
3,"Good, but could not fully enjoy it!!",I will be returning this dvd for a replacement because it is defective. It started skipping right away on previews.Once we hit menu it was fine up until mid-movie it began to skip again. I cleaned and even played on another player with same results.There are no scratches or marks of any kind on the disc. Me and my daughter were enjoying it until I had to remove it!!
3,Great purchase,"Love a great deal, and this was one. Except i was dissapointed that it had private company stickers on the dvd and case."
1,oh Jeepers cripes people!!!,I hate this extremely kweer movie it is a total disgrace if I was you I would buy it just to burn it! I'm giving this movie 2 thumbs down and a fart!
1,Save your money,"This has got to be the worst ""children's"" movie ever made. I can't believe that Mike Myers was a part of this piece of garbage. It's painful to watch--ridiculous humor (and not the good kind), totally inappropriate language and inferences for children to hear, it's shot very dark and ugly.Shrek managed to include adult type humor that was both clever and fun without being inappropriate for children. For example, the cat says ""Judas Priest"" several times, makes a crack at a garden hoe, saying ""You dirty hoe!"", etc. Sorry, not for my four year old.. All of the adult humor, and it's horrible even if you watched it without your kids! Luckily I rented this instead of buying. Save your money!"
1,Why do I have to pay for an advertisement?,I won't tell you how the movie is but I'll tell you I think its horrible that we're not able to watch the movie without first being forced to watch ads for other movies.At least with a VCR tape you could fast forward or at the movies you can get some popcorn while you want.This DVD won't let you just put in the movie and play it.I'm not someone who would download or use illegal copies of movies but if the studios continue creating DVD's with no escape options I might change.
1,This movie stinks!!!!!!!!!,"I can't even begin to explain how terrible this movie really is.This really soils the charm of Dr. Seuss's legacy of children's books by turning the charmingly fun book ""The Cat In The Hat"" into a toilet humor comedy with absolutely disgusting stabs at gross humor and failing miserably at being funny.This is not for children to see by any stretch of the imagination.Even for those who aim to see brainless fun, ""Cat In The Hat"" is stupid even on a low IQ level.Avoid this movie at all costs! This is the greatest piece of garbage that I have had the agony of seeing!..."
1,Hate... Hate... Hate... Hate... Hate... Hate... Hate!,"I thougt The Cat In the hat was supposed to be like the book. When I started watching it, The beginning seemed descent enough.But when the cat came in that all changed. The cat was more crude than Shrek. And shrek is crude enouph. I mean I couldn't even finish it. I didn't fall asleep or anything. I didn't want to finish it. Along with every one else who was watching it with me. In short I Hate.. Hate .. Hate ..Hate .. Hate..Hate.. Hate it.Asia age 11"
1,"This is not ""The Cat in the Hat""","I had heard some negative things about this movie but out of curiosity I decided to go see it. I figured that most of it was over blown. I am thankful that I didn't take any children to it. This movie is not appropriate for children. It is disrespectful to the spirit of ""The Cat in the Hat"" and all fine children's books. The humor is in the poorest taste. There is nothing funny about hepatitis. I now see why I was the only one in the theater."
1,Horrible.,"Seriously a let down. Don't waste your money. Just rent it and you will see how horrible it is, then you would never think about actually spending money to buy it."
1,cat in the hat book 5 stars. movie a big fat 0!!!,"WHY did they do this to the cat in the hat????i did not like the cat when he popped up the first time!!the movie was a complete disaster!!! it stunk worse than anything!!! it was stupid and they made really bad jokes!!they tortured the babysitter through the whole thing!!! it was a pathetic attempt at the book they could have toned the whole thing down!!! like why did they have that stupid boyfriend or whatever he was with his stomach hanging out right in front of the camera? WHY?!?! and he was drinking beer or something and this WAS a kid's movie? this movie belongs in a sewer because it stinks like that!!! and the cat was trying to fix the couch so they could jump on it and he wore a mechanic's outfit and said ""hehehe lets see what's under the hood!!!"" and he turned around and bent down and pogged in front of the camera!!!"
1,The Cat in the Hay,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have seen. Parents, do not take your kids to this because the humor is not suited for young kids."
1,mike myers in the hat,"good thing i went to the earlier showing of this movie, i only waisted $9.00 instead of $16.00, they should have spent a little more time and energy into this movie and i might have actually enjoyed it, instead i felt like is was watching a sequal to another mike myers film."
1,Where is the comedy?,"This is one of the worse movies I have ever seen.The ""good"" review given by Jeffrey Lyons is a J-O-K-E.The acting and writing was A-W-F-U-L.At times I nearly fell asleep during the movie.In fact if you have trouble falling asleep at night,especially children,use this movie.At no time did I laugh during the movie.Now I see why Dr Seuss's widow said she will not let any of her late husband's books be turned into movies and I wouldn't blame her."
2,Epic Fail. I Tried To Like It But It Was Just Imposible.,"I Loved The Book, And LOVED The Cartoon! But This Movie Is Bad! I Have This Dvd And I Still Watch It Every Now And Then. Story: It's Decent But It REALLY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER! Acting: Okay. Actors: Mike Myers Does A Pretty Good Job At Being Goofy, Kelly Preston Is Just A Piece Of A$$ For The Movie, Keeps The Men Intrested (not me), Alec Baldwin Plays The Role Of A Jacka$$ (very unlikeable) Daktoa Fanning And Spencer Breslin Pretty Decent Acting. Overall This Is A Huge Dissapointment, Too Many Jokes Where The Parent Might Get It, But Your Kid Won't, Like Theres A Spelling Joke In The Scene Where The Cat In The Hat Says What S.L.O.W. And Tells The Kids What the Old Car Was Called S.H.!.T., And Theres A Joke About bAll$, And The Horrid Scene Where You Get To See His A$$. Dissapointing, On The Other Hand The Bonus Features Are Good. 3/10."
4,We all loved it!,"My Wife, my 13 yr old, my 11 and my 6 year who has Downs Sydrome and I all really loved it. We watched it at least three times together over a weekend and it is now one of my little guy's favorites.There are very funny things for the adults, the teens, the pre-teens and little kids. Are we missing something? Why did and does this movie get bad reviews?Anyway, we all love it!"
1,Terrible!!,"I don't even need to write a review on it...It's all been said here...The worst Movie I've ever seen in my life, and thats an understatement!Folks, trust all the negative comments...they are the correct ones."
3,Surprisingly lackluster,"After enjoying the remake of the Grinch with Ron Howard and Jim Carrey, I was eager to see if this movie would live up to the success of its predecessor. Mike Myers plays 'The Cat in the Hat', and I have mixed feelings about the role. In some parts, he's actually pretty funny, but in others, completely inappropriate.I don't know what the heck was up with the story and writing. Some of the parts in this movie were funny, but only by themselves. In a movie inspired by a children's book, these jokes were wildly inappropriate and would have been much better suited for films with a PG13-R rating. In one scene, he makes a joke about ho's (with a garden hoe) I can enjoy adult jokes, but this movie was not the right place for them.The kids were okay. Girl's uptight, boy is a troublemaker, but I feel that the way they were written was not quite right. This movie had a lot of unneccessary added story that just completely overshadowed whatever charm this movie had."
1,A disgrace to Dr. Seuss,"Perhaps one of the worst films ever made. This movie is not only a disgrace to the Dr. Seuss legacy, its a disgrace to film making. I really can't imagine what could make this movie any worse! Its THAT bad. Its lude, crude and like watching a hyperactive acid trip in sickly neon colors! I've never thought Myers was funny, but this movie made me absolutely hate him. Not only does he look nothing like the Cat, he looks downright creepy!If a transmission of this film ever makes it to the receivers on a far off planet somewhere, those aliens would come find us just to rid the universe of creatures who could make something this hideous!They should have done what was done with Horton Hears a Who and made this into a CGI movie with anyone voicing the Cat EXCEPT Myers. This film should be burned along with all remaining copies and the planet should pretend it was never made!This movie proves why Ted Giesel didn't want Hollywood to get a hold of his books!"
2,Definitely NOT the Dr Seuss Classic you grew up with,"This is definitely NOT appropriate for young kids. Don't make the mistake I made. I cannot believe they would take an innocent classic and turn it into this trash. I am not a prude- on the contrary, I enjoy adult humor, and many rated R movies of the likes of American Pie, but I EXPECT to see that sort of thing in those movies. I don't expect to see that in a classic story that kids love. The centerfold foldout of the mother's photo, the obvious staring down the dress of the mother by the wicked neighbor, the rave scene- those are just a few.Now, I gave this two stars because it really is funny, and the DVD is packed with a lot of great extras. But don't think for a minute that it's appropriate for your 6-8 year old kids."
1,"Worst kid movie ever, ever made. PERIOD.","I saw it in theaters when it first came out with my older sister. And after watching it, both of us wished we never watched it. The humor is horrible, the actors are bad (mike myers' worst role ever), and the story (Oh, God) is stupid and pointless. The side-characters are very annoying and everything about that movie just makes me hate it even more.My advice? DO NOT SEE IT. DO NOT BUY IT. IF SOMEONE GIVES YOU THE MOVIE, TOSS IT IN THE FIRE! Just don't watch at all."
1,How bad can it get...,I have never seen a botch job on a book to movie this bad.There were very few rhymes and none of the attempts athumor made me laugh. There was little resemblance to thebeloved classic that one assumes was the inspiration forthe movie. Save your money.
2,What A Sad Loss...,"Cat in the Hat could have been a classic. Plus...you have Mike Meyers, a master playing the role of the cat - how could you go wrong?!?Poor writing! Wow...The movie is so cute with the special effects and goofy Mike Meyers voices & actions. But so often I asked myself through out the movie - why the heck did they just say that? or do that?Half way through I turned to the person I was watching it with, and said ""This movie is SO bad!""...they giggled, and said, ""it's about time you say that!""...they didn't want to make me feel bad because I was the one who bought it...Too bad...this movie could have really been something special. I don't even know who I would recommend this flick to. I'd say - stick with Jim Carey's The Grinch!"
1,Shame,"Having gorwn up with Cat in the Hat books and stories when I was a child, I found this movie to be a shame. The way they were able to bring the story to life was brilliant, but the Character of the Cat in the Hat was simply shameful. I was sickened, and do recommend to any and all parents and guardians to watch it first before allowing their child to see it. I find it hard to believe it's rated at PG. it should be PG-13. It truly is a shame to see such a wonderful story become a waste."
1,A hairball of a movie,"Full of double-entendres and potty humor, this film spits on the original book and the people who love it. The gross-out gags are totally wrong, wrong, wrong for a Dr. Seuss story. The story is padded out with unnecessary subplots. Some folks may like it but I was offended and felt it was not appropriate for kids. Seuss' stories had a freewheeling innocence and wholesomeness to them; this film version is a smirking dirty joke pretending to be kiddie fare.Just as bad as THE GRINCH. Also, just as badly overmarketed. Let's hope it flops so they don't desecrate any more Seuss classics."
1,Used !!!!! DVD,DVD is seriously scratched !! Should have never been allowed to be sold in the first place .... buying from this seller again is very doubtful !!
1,Complete and total waste of my time,"I liked The Grinch so I thought ""how bad could it be""? Wrong thought! For those of you that have already seen it, I'm sorry. And for those of you who haven't, don't even think about it. Even though the humor suites Mike Myers style and he plays his part well, the part itself is flawed. No plot surprises, (Who hasn't read The Cat in the Hat?) bad special effects, and stupid humor. (I tried to come up with a better word than ""stupid"" but I couldn't) This is definitely not The Cat in the Hat that we knew as children. Since when did he start blatantly referencing the words S.H._.T, B_TCH and _SS? Or show someone get hit in the b_lls and a dog p_ss on a sandwich? Ok for some comedy movies but gave me a bad feeling in this one. I guess I should have set my expectations a little more in accordance with the PG-13 rating of the movie and not the G rating of the book."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER,"I need to be reimbursed for the time and money I spent watching this movie. I love Mike Myers, but this role is Dr. Evil/Fat (...) in a cat suit. This film has nothing to do with Dr. Seuss and I'm sure he would be ashamed of it."
1,The ruins of a classic,"I am astounded! My family just finished watching this movie and was truly dissapointed! 1. Don't mess with classics (ex ""The Grinch""). 2. Don't make something that just isn't meant to be. 3. Using cliches from an actors previous movie just doesn't carry over. 4. There were some comments made that I was thought to be inappropriate for a child's classic, such as the acronym for his vehichle, the soiled garden accessory, and finally burned bottoms. If Dr. Suess was alive this would surely kill him. I don't think this is what he had in mind when these stories were written. Please do not continue the making of such movies!"
2,ALMOST TERRIBLE!,This movie could have been a WHOLE lot better! Almost all of this film was set in the house. I think this movie should of been rated G. If your looking for a good movie to see then this one isn't the one! This is probobly not the movie a teen wouldn't like. If I were you I would avoid buying this bad movie! The actor who was playing the cat wasn't even funny!
4,Austin Powers Meets Dr. Seuss,"How could anyone NOT like this film? It is colorful. witty, and incredibly entertaining. Kids love it because it's fast paced and ""silly"" ... adults love it for the celebrity cameos and ""smart"" humor (whatever that means). For those who like to ""light up"" and watch cartoons, this movie is highly recommended. All other viewers may want to try renting it first."
4,Nerds need not apply,"Wow! After reading some of these reviews, I realize there are a lot of really uptight people out there. I found this movie VERY funny in places, as did my 10 year old. He rarely laughs at movies, but I kept hearing him chuckle. And where are all these 'gross jokes' I keep hearing about? Either you all are hyper-sensitive or you don't watch any Disney, Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network cartoons, because there's a belch, fart or crotch racking in just about every episode. I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in quite some time - the infomercial scene and the little clip after the Cat gets hit with the baseball bat were sheer hilarity, as was the Cat's comments when tracking down the missing family dog. Lighten up, folks, and enjoy the movie for what it is - entertainment. It's not meant to make any political statements or be an Oscar-contender. Duh."
2,Not the bible I expected,"I was extremely disapointed with the content of the book. I definitely can't say that I would be able to build a log home with the insufficient information provided. I found explanations were confusing, unclear and not detailed at all. It seems that the author is assuming everybody knows how to build a house. There was not enough pictures or images to illustrate some of the most important steps of making a log home (e.g. scribing the logs...). I find this book may be interesting to get familiar with the basics of log building but it's definitely not a technical reference for a builder wannabe."
4,"Clear and concise, great pics and drawings - good stuff!","Allen Mackie's the original starting point for the resurrgence of the craft of log building and can be traced to every major log building project built in the past 30+ years around the world! This book is a good how-to and often used by owner builders and students alike with great results! I just wish he would do something on log roof support systems in greater detail and also a new revised edition of ""The Picture Book of Log Homes""! We're looking for the day! Lasko School of Log Building - Bill Lasko"
2,50% product failure,I purchased four of these for gifts. Two of the four were dead on arrival. This is a very high failure rate.
5,Wine Thermometer,It works as designed. Excellent. Drinking wine at the proper temperature is very important and this thermometer helps do the job.
1,Change the title...,I bought this book and felt like this is more a book about Jesus Christ than optimism. Which is fine I just feel like the title doesn't really represent what it is about. I didn't care much for this authors writing as he seems to talk endlessly about non essential items in his life and then proceed to talk more about what he's going to talk about or had talked about. I didn't care for this book too much at all.
3,I actually feel this,"Big Ed isnt the average No Limit member. He has more lyrical style and a smoother flow. This may not be the album for you, but for some it may be."
3,Big Ed shows a new style...,"The Assassin by Big Ed hase an other style than the other NL albums... some new producers makes it sound a bit more west. It's a strong 3 star album though, there are featuring on allmost every track. But some songs are a bit anoying. Try listning to tracks: 15,16,18... and the Steddy Mobbin' track they are really five star tracks."
5,Stop Hatin,I read all of these reviews and everyone says that the cd is only good because of the guest apperances. that's B.S. The best song on the cd is SCRIPTURES and he is solo on the song. People need to realize that Big Ed is a great rapper.
1,HERE WE GO AGAIN.,"Big Ed is tryin to be too hard on this one. He really ain't no good. I like some of the beats and the other rappers verses, especially Fiend's and Mystikal's. The guest rappers almost make the album worth the one star I HAD TO give it."
1,"AFTER A SECOND LISTEN, HE STILL STINKS!","I AM ON A MISSION TO BRING HIS RATING DOWN. IT IS VERY MISLEADING. I AM A NL FAN, BUT THIS MAN SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE RAPPERS WHO SHOULD NEVER MAKE IT. I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I WAS ON THE NL BANDWAGON, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. BEATS BY THE POUND ARE VERY TALENTED, BUT THE ASSASSIN NEEDS DIVINE INTERVENTION TO GET ANYTHING BUT A ONE FROM OL' JAY DUB. LSG-4-LFE! HE DOES SOUND LIKE HE COULD BE 'BOUT IT, THOUGH. HE NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS FLOW OR STAY UNDERGROUND; THE MAINSTREAM AIN'T FOR HIM."
5,Tight Debut by Big Ed!,"Big Ed has come out with a very tight cd. All the No Limit Soldiers appear, including Master P Mac and C-Murder. Beats by the Pound has done an excellent job also. The lyrics are tightly rhymed to the beat and the stuff is put together pefectly Songs like My Entourage Buck'em and Scriptures are off tha hizook. If you like No Limit rap then pick up this cd. Big Ed deserves gold. The cd is high quality so pick it up Ya Heard Me! (big ed is the best rapper on no limit)"
5,tight album,"really worth buying, ""My Entourage"", ""Life"", ""I Miss 'Em"" and ""Make Some Room"" are the highlights!R.I.P. Edward Knight, I'll never forget you. TRU Soldier till the day that I die!"
4,4 Stars! One of No Limit's Best!,"Big Ed's death has made it a little easy to click on the 5 star button when reviewing his CDs. I mean no disrespect to the man and his legacy and I actually consider it compliment to the man to give him a strong 4 star rating for his first solo. The CD runs a tad bit on the long side, but it bumps through and through thanks to a strong showing from Beats By The Pound and all the guest rappers. Possibly a way to thank him for his years of service, Master P gave Big Ed the arsenal needed and Big Ed delivered.His style and flow is more straight forward than other tank soldiers, but on tracks like ""Assassin"" and ""Life"" Big Ed showed he had lyrics and flow. The posse cuts here are as strong as on any NL CD, with Fiend and Mystikal putting forth particularly strong appearances. Even Snoop Dogg joins the party at one point.This is one of the better NL releases out there and definitely worth a purchase if you come across it."
5,Excellent Debut,Big Ed has come out with a very tight debut. The Assassin has all the No Limit soldiers on this cd. The production by Beats by the Pound is definitely tight. If you like No Limit then pick up this cd.
3,A mediocre album from the late 90's No Limit,"I purchased this album quite a while ago, at least 5 years. The cd is all right, but there's only a few songs worth listening to. That's just my opinion. Catchy beats can be found in here, like the track Rodeo. Big Ed, who has been a member of the 'Tank' for a long time now, contributes a very unique sound to the label. His voice is quite snappy, and cranky most of the time... Okay, on all of the tracks. But this can be good for some of the darker sounding songs like ""My Entourage"". I enjoy the album, but I'd really only suggest buying this to hardcore NL fans who are familiar with the old NL sound, or to those who have heard Big Ed before"
3,Really bout 2 1/2,"This cd was released years after it should have been. By then, his flow was out dated. If u listen to old TRU then this cd isnt for u. They should hav kept those old beats. The cd would hav made more sense."
5,Awesome!! I loved this book!,"To all of you who are bad-mouthing this book, stuff it. It's not modern writing but if you read it to read it, not because you have a book report due, you'll like it. I picked it up and could'nt put it down except for a breif exception where I thought my bladder would explode, but then I picked it back up again. I would definitely rate this as a classic and, although some of it is a tad unrealistic, almost all of it is believable. I would highly suggest that if you have a few spare hours, you should immeadietly pick it up and if not, wait for a weekend (or a better time) and then do it. This book is Awesome!"
5,Dear Mokarl,"Sir, I do not know where you went to school but your appaling spelling doesn't exactly support your claim that ""The Guns of Naverone"" has poor sentence structure etc. How would you know? You seem hardly qualified to judge given your command of the English language. I suggest you hit the books a little before you give such ridiculous reviews. This is the exact reason I love these reviews, they are hilarious!"
4,Good action thriller that has stood the test of time!,"I read this book many years ago as a teenager, and after having purchased a Kindle I decided to revisit it, as it has been a very long time. As then, I am enjoying this book immensely, it's a great war time action story, with characters larger than life (the way we like them), but able to hold your interest. The characterization is brilliantly done and you would swear that if you ever met these characters on the street you would know them just like that, introductions un-necessary.It's a classic British versus Germans war time yarn, with a seemingly mismatched band of extremely competent soldiers sent into an occupied Island to silence some big German guns and thus effect the rescue of many trapped allied soldiers.The story is gripping, forcing to you to always be wanting to turn the page, even when it's well and truely past bedtime! What more can we want from an action book. Highly recommended!"
5,Super classic,"The way the book is written takes the reader along with Captain Keith Mallory and his crew: you are with them climbing the mountain, freezing to death... You want to go to the last page in a heartbeat."
2,"Good website, awful book.","Recipes inconsistent with their website, which would be fine, if they worked. Completely different time/temperatures that lead to the food not being cooked anywhere near what it should be. The amount of ingredients are also different, but not proportionally so, leading to a completely different product than what you expect. Stay away from the cookbook, and just use their free website, because you'll actually get decent food instead of wasting your money."
4,It's a keeper but..,I too would have liked to see a hardback version of the book for the price. I like how the book has pictures of every dish. I'm just happy to see more cookbooks in english--and in measurements that are easy to follow.
4,Wonderful Food!,"My husband is Dominican and this cookbook has brought back many memories for him. It may not be easy finding all the ingredients, but the food sure is good!"
2,OVERPRICED,"I agree with the second reviewer. I also bought this book (4 of them actually) thinking I would get nice hardcover books; instead it is slim book with medium quality photos. I praise the effort to compile Dominican recipes in English, since there are few available. But the quality of the book does not justify the price at all."
5,"Great, can I get another one for this price? I Think Not!",I paid $85.oo for this because it was refurbished. I'll assume it did not meet the expectations of the original owner and they returned it. It does not have something??? that my Pro Ears for $300.oo bucks has but is fine for a loaner here at our sportsmen's club so if you want to support youth leagues let me know when you get more at this price.
3,not what i expected,"From the description, I thought this book made actual sounds. It doesn't. The pages are thin considering the book is meant to be interactively handled. Even though the quality isn't what I expected, my daughter still loves it."
2,Meh. Author seems to be trying too hard,"I had high hopes for this parody when I saw the cover with the line, ""If we likess it, then we putss a ring on it"". Unfortunately that is probably the best line in (on) the book.Oh, there are chuckle-worthy moments. But mostly it's rather lame. I get the feeling that the author really wasn't in the mood to really let loose with the silliness and was trying too hard to meet a contract deadline. And I agree with the other reviews that said he changed the storyline far too much for a good parody.""The Soddit"" is not comparable to National Lampoon's 1969 ""Bored of the Rings"". Even though a lot of ""Bored""'s references are dated, it's still pretty hysterical. I was hoping for that level of humor, updated to the 21st century."
2,Still waiting,"I purchased this December 23, 2011 and I have not received it yet.The price was great and I have heard good things but...I can't speak my like or dislike of the magazine just yet."
1,No Mag After 4 Weeks,"Title says it all. Is it coming, Amazon or what? Next time, order directly through the magazine rather than through a third party like Amazon."
1,Have not received the First Issue yet.,I Have not received the First Issue yet. I am beginning to wonder when and if I will.I ordered it Oct.16th 2009.
1,What magazine???,"I subscribed to this magazine in January for my husband. It took 5 months to get the first magazine, then I never recieved another one."
1,the magazine that did not show up,"Wish I could write more but no magazine ,no correspondence other that this review request as sescriber I have yet to receive one magazine stone cold nothing."
3,"A few interesting men's articles, health, living, etc.","I subscribed to Men's Journal because Amazon offered it at a super-low price for the year. I like most of the articles, but it is all content that is widely available elsewhere with much better writing. Some of the recent topics include vacation spots, wine recommendations, celeb stories, outdoor adventure stories, etc. It is worth a look, especially at the discounted Amazon rate."
4,"I have subscribed for years, this was very easy.","I like the fact they give you a heads-up as to when the subscription will be done, so you will remember to deduct it from your checking account. The magazine is a good one for all men."
4,Great Magazine,"I'm not a big magazine reader but this one has it all. Male or female, if you like reading about all of the adventures our planet has to offer, this is the magazine for you. I plow through each issue within a day or two of its arrival and then eagerly await the next issue!"
4,Great magazine,"This is a great magazine. It's definitely geared towards readers vs. the other men's magazines out there that fill the pages with visuals and half naked women. Also, the tone of the magazine doesn't seem to speak to the lowest common denominator and I don't feel like it objectifies women the way, say Maxim does. I'm hooked."
4,Enjoyable Read,"Having read most every men's magazine over the years, Men's Journal has become my favorite. I most enjoy the wide variety of articles. I least enjoy a seeming preoccupation with sports I will never come close to trying (e.g., ""Gear up for the upcoming season of back country helicopter skiing""). All in all, though, a good mix of articles on interesting people and places to visit."
4,good source,"I really like the interviews, and some sport/health-related articles. Just most the merchandise being offered is waaay above my pay grade. But dreaming does not pay taxes..."
4,Fun resource for active men,"This is a great magazine to highlight the fun places to go, things to do and things to own. It is not highbrow with big book excerpts, nor is is lowbrow with a bunch of buxom women all over the magazine.This is a magazine for active, athletic and adventurous men. There are 1 or 2 interesting articles about travel or adventure in each issue along with a feature article on varying topics from contributing writers. There are always good features on health and fitness tips. Lastly, the magazine highlights sports gear, fashion and gadgets.It is a fun, light (usually) magazine that I look forward to receiving each month."
1,Formerly Great,"The pages of Men's Journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves. They brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11. Since that time, MJ has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be, which might have been fine for one issue. This is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas."
1,RIP OFF !!!!,"a Complete rip off I ordered this months ago and have yet to receive First Issue . When I contacted them I was told they need proof of purchase so I sent them a copy of my invoice . A week later get a response telling me that there records show I am wrong and it's my fault , I either entered the wrong address or the post office is stealing my mail Never Again RIP OFF !!!!!"
1,where's my magazine?,"I'd be happy to review this magazine if I ever receive a copy. Hopefully Amazon will fulfill its end of this subcription purchase one of these days and actually send me a magazine. Til then, I give it a lousy review."
4,"An annual ""Great Knockers"" edition would make it perfect.","I'm serious. Men's Journal has all the stuff that men like to read - all the gear, adventure, how-to, where to go, neat stuff up the ying-yang and cover stories about famous guys doing what they do....but....there's nary a hot babe in sight. I know that Men's Journal doesn't concentrate on T&A, but I think they could throw us guys a fish with an annual Greatest Titty Issue featuring perhaps a 100 great sets of knockers. It hasn't hurt Sports Illustrated circulation, has it? With a touch of skin, Men's Journal could be the perfect men's mag."
1,Never received,Until now I have never received my 1st issues for my subscription. I ordered on around the 1st of August.
2,Not like it used to be,"I used to enjoy this magazine, but it just doesn't have the interesting articles and information it used to. I cancelled subscription even though it was very inexpensive. Usually ended up in recycle bin soon after arriving in mailbox."
2,Too much foul language! Otherwise good magazine.,"There is too much foul language, otherwise the magazine has some great articles and interviews. Also, we didn't subscribe to the magazine, but it is being sent to us, so perhaps they got our credit card info from Amazon or ? so that's not cool."
4,Balanced journal with good depth of articles,An intellectually stimulating and broadening magazine; with high levels of journalism and great depth of article.
2,"New Mag For Me, Maybe Not For You.","I only received this magazine a few days ago, therefore I feel that I can not give it a proper review as of yet. What I have read was interesting. The articles are short to keep the attention span."
1,No show!,This order has not arrived. I am still looking for it. What a disappointment. Sure hope it arrives soon; would hate to think the worse.
2,Waste of time.,"This magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work, had time to work out four hours a day, had your own chef, could go on vacation six months out of the year, or could afford (or cared) about fashion. Otherwise don't bother. They sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it."
3,men journal review,this magazine is ok. got it thinking that it would be relevant for me. It isnt really. There is some relevant info but its mostly sporty with ads for cologne.
2,Not in my taste,"I'm your average 30 year old whose in to tech, cars, and thought this might be somewhat interesting. I found it absolutely uninteresting. I think they're targeting the 40+ community or the uber-boring uber-office job oriented folks. Consider it the Readers Digest for 40 year olds."
3,Armchair Adventurers Only,"I bought this magazine on a regular basis many years ago. Subscribed again for variety in my magazine diet but cancelled it after 2 issues. The volume and content has slimmed quite a bit since the early days.The focus is now mostly on where people go for physical activities. Less focus on gear review and doesn't inspire one to ""get-out-there"" as much as previously."
4,"Thoughful, well balanced magazine.","This is a magazine that is has a great balance. It has informative, well written articles ranging from interviews with Lance Armstrong to an actors or just writers excursion to places you might never see or travel to (i.e. Democratic Republic of Congo or Vietnam or Antarctica) but it makes you want to go there. It tells you about adventure spots to go to, the price, and the gear you need. It also deals with environmental issues that make you think about going more green, but then on the next page it is reviewing the newest muscle car. It is just a fun, imaginative mag that I really have enjoyed reading for the last 4 years or so. Worth the buy."
2,Got it for free. Glad I didn't pay for it.,"Magazine is okay. Seems to try to be a cross between Outside and GQ. Doesn't succeed very well. Articles are pretty short, and lots of reviews of high priced items I would never buy. It does have nice photos."
3,Cool gadgets...,"I got this year subscription for a dollar, so I figured why not, eh? It's not that great in my opinion. The best part of the magazine to me is the gadgets sections."
5,Bought for husband,"I felt this was a good bargain, so I asked my husband if he'd be interested in it. When he said ""yes"", I ordered it. He seems to enjoy the topics they cover....so I'm pleased."
2,Immature Men's Journal,"20 years ago it was a good magazine, but it relies on profanity for the majority of articles. I read magazines for the information and I don't need young lads spouting off the ""F"" word to get their biased opinions across. It isn't my cup of tea anymore."
1,Is this a joke?,"I bought a subscription for my husband, thinking it would have a variety of men's topics, like sports, health, etc.Instead, it's either editorial garbage (not useful information) or the kind of ""articles"" you could find in a tabloid.I guess instead of finding a mix of subjects, we will just have to stick withMen's Health (1-year)and Sports Illustrated (1-year)."
2,Not bad,"Basically ""Cosmo"" for men. Won't buy again. About 25% of it is worth reading, but I have better things to read."
3,Does it come with the power supply DC 7.4 V AC adapter?,"I am a long time brazilian customer of Amazon and am interested in buying this item, but it does not mention the AC adapter on the item ""box content"". It is mentioned in the specifications and but it may not be included. Please answer asap because frinds are coming to Brazil and will bring it to me.[...]"
3,It is in color,"As you can all check with IMDB the movie is in color, so check first if the dvd is BW or color or if it is just a description mistake. Format 2:35."
4,Tales from the Medicine Trail,Wonderful travel adventures as well as a professional look at the world of natural medicines. The world needs more people with the heartfelt dedication of Chris Kilham. A great read.....
2,Deep Christian Overtones,"York and LaRue's book presented interesting arguements of reasons to protect children in the so-called ""X-Rated World"". However, the book also shared opinions and social commentary with serious religious biases. It was difficult to concentrate on the topic when the authors often digress onto religious topics of which I do not agree. The authors address the issue of premarital sex and homosexuality with complete intolerance for those of alternative lifestyles. When they accused Planned Parenthood of ""promoting traditional-values-free sex for teens"" and of having a ""radical agenda"" I grew frustrated and abandoned the book. The authors, while presenting accurate information about the pervasiveness and danger of children accessing information via the Internet, they also presented their own ""radical agenda""s with Christian biases and promoting wholly the intolerance of homosexuals."
1,"The idea is OK, but author is not","Jan LaRue is one of the most narrow-minded, accusatory, and ugly (I mean on the inside) women I've ever heard speak (or read) and you'd be better off following the guidance of someone who truly cares about your children, not just about her own narrow agenda."
3,Same info over and over...,"Prevention magazine is ok. It's really the same information over and over. I guess there is only so much info out there on health and wellness. I do like the compact size so it's easy to carry in my purse and read it when I am in waiting rooms or waiting to pick someone up. I like it when there are stories on The Biggest Loser contestants, like the one with Ali Vincent."
3,Good tips,"This is not a magazine I would normally subscribe to, but it was free with purchase so why not. There's some good articles and tips in it."
2,eh,I ordered this due to a promotion. I can't really find anything worthwhile to read in the magazine. I think I am too young for the target audience.
3,Good.,"I like the health articles the magazine features every month. Most of the articles are related to general health/problems that could affect anyone, than they are specific issues, like heart health, diabetes maintenance/prevention, and healthy diet and exercise. The magazine usually features at least a few healthy recipes, complete with nutritional information. I enjoy when exercises are included, such as yoga poses or strengthening moves for knees, back, etc.I'm not too keen on the price of a subscription sometimes. I only subscribe/renew when I can catch a good deal on Amazon because spending $15 on a smaller magazine that seems to be filled with a ton of ads does not appeal to me. Four stars would have been given had it not have been for the amount of ads that has seemed to increase over the years."
3,what happened to the original size?,"Boy, magazines have shrunk! It is more like a pamphlet with ads. Fewer articles. I hope the knowledge behind the articles is as good as it used to be when the magazine was of substantial thickness."
2,Great reputation but that remains to be seen.,"Although I've paid for this magazine, it has yet to arrive so it's difficult to evaluate. I've read Prevention magazine before and think I'll like this book but....I need to have it physically arrive before I can read it!"
3,If you like advertisements then this is the magazine for you!,"I'm glad this only cost $5.00 for a year's subscription. All the ""articles"" are about 1 page long, so you don't really learn anything about anything."
2,Ad Overboard,"I received a free yearly subscription after enjoying Stonyfield Farms yogurt. I found absolutely no content worthy of reading. 75% of the tiny magazine was ads for medications, which I live a much more natural lifestyle than that. This magazine was not for me. I'll stick to my Women's Health Magazine!"
1,Waste of Money,"I just received the June 2011 issue with Terry Hatcher on the cover. Good god. Yet another whiney #@$ actress triumphing over health problems. In her case they were completely preventable had she excercised proper safety precautions--like don't wear Uggs when you climb a ladder to do painting. The article starts off in the first sentence describing her as ""accident prone""!!!It isn't just this issue, it's EVERY issue. You expect to read about stupid actresses who can't chew gum and walk at the same time in People Magazine not what used to be a great resource for health information."
1,NOT AS GOOD AS IT USED TO BE,"MY MOTHER AND I USED TO GET THIS MAGAZINE FOR MANY MANY YEARS IN THE PAST. I DECIDED TO TRY IT AGAIN AFTER NOT SUBSCRIBING FOR A LONG TIME. I AM GOING TO CANCEL. THE ARTICLES OVER THE LAST THREE MAGAZINES HAVE BEEN USELESS AND UNINTERESTING TO ME. ALSO, THE MAGAZINE SIZE IS SO MUCH SMALLER THAN IT USED TO BE. NOT A GOOD VALUE LIKE IT USED TO BE."
2,Not What It Used To Be,My parents subscribed to Prevention for years but it just is not the same anymore; they found it helpful I periodically pick it up at the store lured by the titles of some articles but when I get inside I find it is all ads and very little substance. Every month seems just like a repeat of the previous month. It just doesn't give me what I want in a health magazine. Every time I fall for the cover and then vow I won't do it again. I have been let down too many times. Don't waste your time and money on this magazine. The Rodale people are just big business.
1,Not Worth the $,"As so many have pointed out, this used to be a terrific magazine in the 1970's, full of cutting-edge information as well as useful home remedies that are now very hard to find. Now it's just another cheap, commercial waste of time."
2,Interesting tidbits here and there ... but not worth it,"I used to love this magazine a few years ago but was disappointed to find out, like many other readers, that now it is so much about losing weight and advertising drugs. I have found a handful of really useful tidbits here and there, but in spite of my passionate interest in health, I find myself piling up these magazines to read on a rainy day (when I always find something better to do).And, the auto-renew thing is annoying. I attempted to cancel via mail, but still got a reminder notice via email. When I clicked on the link, no option was available to cancel. I called the 800# which gave me some cancellation options...to cancel auto renew and cancel unpaid issues. I had to make two phone calls to do both. Still not sure if they are going to bill me.Too bad that a great magazine ended up this way. :("
3,It's Okay,"""This magazine is for women"" said my husband as he read it. I didn't realize it was when I ordered it. It is and Okay little magazine but I probably wouldn't order it again."
3,This was a renewal,The magazine is interesting enough. It provides a good short form of health issues. I most probably will renew again.
2,Tons of Tidbits,"There are very few serious articles in this magazine-- just tons of tidbits (stats/facts/tips). By the time you get to the end it's difficult to recall anything from the magazine; it's that shallow.Occasionally there's a good recipe, but that's about it."
1,"Content OK, Service HORRIBLE","I find the actual articles to be okay but there ARE a ton of ads!!! A first-time subscriber and it took over 2 months to get the first issue then I am continuously having to complain about not getting my subscriptions. They say they have no control of the delivery once it is in the mail. They will send copies. Why am I paying to get old copies sent to me? I think their department that deals with subscriptions need some SERIOUS help. My sister orders from Rodale (another magazine though)and she also has the same problem....maybe they should run an article on dealing with stress as that is all I am getting.....of course, I may have to wait a few months before I actually get that article, come to think of it. :)"
5,great little magazine,"i just love this little magazine; I like the little, easily held, format, as well as the great content. I have learned a lot from reading this magazine and would highly recommend it. Initially, by the title, for some reason, I assumed it was for older people, but I ordered it at age 38, and it is one of my favorites."
2,Too faithy,"I liked some of the health articles, but the issue I looked at recently had way too much of a Christian-type faith-based slant. Not for me; just give me the science, please."
2,Not giving me the information I expected,I am a little disappointed at Prevention magazine. I have had it before and it was so informative on a lot of updated medical info. These issues seem geared toward losing weight as most magazines are. I wish I had gotten Readers Digest instead.
3,The Magazine Diva says.......,"Prevention is a magazine anyone can benefit from with great ideas on easy lifestyle changes. On the flip they are not very specific, although geared more toward a female audience. Some issues are excellent and some are average, but always informative and positive, never condesending."
1,Can't seem to find any articles...,"I used to get this magazine several years ago and thought it offered alot of useful information - Currently, this magazine has turned into an advertising mecca - very little useful content. If you took all the ads out, I bet the magazine would only be about 4 pages long. Not much depth or educational information any more. Very disappointing. Amazon said my subscription would start in November. So far in the past 2 weeks I have received the Aug, Sept. and Oct. issues. All are the same - all ads, no substance. Glad I only wasted $5 and will not be renewing."
4,Prevention Has Lost Some of its Leading Edge Momentum!,"This magazine used to be at the leading edge of health, vitamins and healthy lifestyle issues. It seems to have lost that momentum. I often hear of new therapies and vitamin-supplements in other magazines, rather than PREVENTION.I have to say, ""Ditto"" to the criticism of the huge numbers of ads! Advertizers must pay extra to appear next to an informational article on the the product they sell. I think that shows how concerned PREVENTION is about helping us make informed decisions about our health."
4,Prevention Recommendation,Prevention Magazine provides up-to-date information to consumers who are concerned about their health and what is new in the field of medical research. I look to Prevention Magazine for family health and nutrition information.
4,good info to have,"I bought one Prevention magazine at the grocery store and loved the info that it contained, so I ordered a subscription. It said that it would take 6-10 weeks to arrive so I bought the next month's magazine at the grocery store. The subscription arrived the same week!! The second magazine did not hit home with me as much as the first month, but that is to be expected. I'm looking forward to next month's. It's material is not life changing for me, but it gives me ideas on how to tweak my diet and exercise/lifstyle. I enjoy the magazine. I would order it again."
1,CANCELLED --- POLITICAL PUSH -- AND I AM TIRED OF IT,"This magazine has more political - left political push each edition.I am not renewing and am looking forward to getting rid of this magazine.The first few magazines went from the mailbox to the trash.This magazine was a disappointment, I cancelled it (lost money to end it).The political push is so obvious and I hear enough of that hype on TV and on the news, I read to get away and relax and this magazine has Obama, Katie Couric and other liberal on the cover and inside the magazine far too often -- enough already!"
4,"One of my favorites, though too many ads","There are definitely too many ads in this magazine, but I do love it. It is one of the few I get that I read almost every article. Always something interesting and always has good recipes. I like this one a lot!"
2,Magazine interesting but...,Received three magazines (past months) on one day - not what I was thinking when I ordered a one year subscription.
3,magazine subscription,"not only was the 1st issue delivered,too fast, an older issue was also sent. I had already purchased both issues at the news stand"
3,old copy sent,"I received the January and February copy of Prevention on the same day. Now I know the January copy was out in December because I picked one up because the order form claimed I would not receive an issue until February, which technically would be the March issue. I just feel it was tacky business for prevention to send an old issue out with the current issue. I don't have my account number handy and I have not notified them yet about this, so feel free to pass this on. Thank you. p.s. I do like the magazine."
3,Delivering to the wrong person,The magazine is being delivered to me instead of the person I ordered it for.
3,"Good for a year, gets boring after that","I have subscriptions to several magazines and this was one of my initial ones. I loved it for the first couple of months and then it started getting repetitive. Each month they talk about these different quick weight loss programs by following a diet plan and exercises and it gets boring. I wish they would focus on different issues each month. Even though they had other topics on the cover page, I felt their main focus was still on weigh loss.The part I enjoyed the most was their recipes, each month they had a good selection of recipes and I have added them to my repertoire. I think Health is a better magazine and there are more useful topics being covered each month. I currently have a subscription to health and prefer it over prevention."
1,Never did receive,"I never did receive this order. I paid for it , but I'm still waiting 4 months later. I haveen't heard from anyone and I don't know how to contact them. I guess sometimes ordering from the internet is a hit and miss process."
3,Beware rodale scams,"I've been receiving prevention magazine for years even after being scammed ,I moved at one point ,forgettig subscription I started getting demand for payments on a magazine I had not been receiving and was reordered without my know leg .further more NEVER order a book as you will get taken for a lot of money on any of there books the 30day to see ,well if you return the book your looking for at least spending 30 ,so much for a free look. As for the last person I agree ,every month it is the same thing new? Diets ,not much of real value anymore also stoked with questiol advertisement for items defiantly not heathy"
1,Sent to Collection Agency After Cancellation of this Magazine!,"I ordered Prevention Magazine, and did not like it. When I got the bill, I sent a cancellation notice, and got no more of them. Just today I got a notice from a collection agency for the entire subscription amount! I will NEVER order this magazine, and will tell my friends of this experience!""Risk Free GuaranteeIf you find that within the first 90 days of placing an order you are not 100% satisfied - for any reason - let us know and we will gladly give you a full, prompt refund. Any issues you may have received are yours to keep!""....HA!"
1,"What Happened to the ""80's"" Prevention with Real Articles??","I started my first subscription to this one in 1980-81. It was EXCELLENT!! It had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to ""preventing"" ailments/conditions. Now it's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters! Wow...what a change now. I'm not interested in ""paying"" to read ads. I'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources. Besides, I got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while I rode the stationery bike! What a waste of trees. :("
5,Excellent text.,"I've had my experiences with a wide variety of Spanish language learning materials, and out of the textbooks I've used, the Pasajes series (especially when used as a series, including the Literatura and Cultura components) ranks as the best. Pasajes strikes the perfect balance between a text for rank beginners and advanced students.It is abundantly clear to me that the authors of this wonderful work are acutely aware of the difficulties the student of Spanish -- especially intermediate Spanish -- is likely to face. As such, the text reads as more of a ""conversation"" between ""teacher"" and student, then a stern, authoratative text handing down the received wisdom to your unworthy soul. A real pleasure to work through.Although one is more likely to encounter this text as part of a college Spanish program, I would highly recommend it to any serious Spanish student intent on reaching a higher level of accomplishment."
2,Confusing,"This book was confusing - Too much similiar information packed into the same chapter, very confusing for students....."
3,interesting book,although not my favorite book I rate it as ok cause I would like to have seen them explain the words a little more so we can understand what some of the passages are saying; However I did learn alot about Spanish culture and I loved it!
1,not pleased,"This book is said to be ""The Diary of Samuel Pepys"" and true it is...however it is only part 2 of a 10 part diary but you wouldnt know that unless you bought it and saw that the book starts with the end of a sentence from the previous volume. very sad."
3,Enjoyable,"Not the best book in this genre, but not half bad either. Could use some good editing as she gets wordy and could lose a few thousand words to make the book tighter.My main complaint is that I kept wanting to know more about the sisters - their background, jobs, family, etc. She does well discussing her neighbors and people she meets, also includes many details about growing, harvesting and making olive oil and wine, but she does not let you in to her life. Thus I found the book did not really pull me in and I was left with a lot of questions."
4,Light hearted,"This is a light hearted description of 2 foreign girls working on the Italian Riviera.They have make friends, have adventures and have no pretensions. It's a pleasure to read this book and escape for a few hours."
4,WARNING: Do not read this book when you are hungry,"I enjoyed this book but found that it got bogged down at times; hence, the four stars rather than five. The author captured the essence of country/rural Italians, aka ""peasants."" And the descriptions of the wonderful meals reinforce the Italian notion, and here I will translate, ""at the table one grows old.""When reading the book, if you've ever been to Italy or have lived with an Italian family in the U.S., both of which I have experienced, you can almost hear the loud voices of everyone talking at once to get a point across. That's one essence of being Italian, imo. The book is really an enjoyable read but needed tighter editing."
5,Terrific story-telling,"I have read a number of ""let's buy a tumble-down house in a foreign country and renovate it while we learn to live in a new /old culture"" books, and this is the best of the lot. Annie Hawes is a great story-teller and made me laugh out loud at the characters and characterizations. I've given the book as a gift to my mother and various friends, and everyone unanimously loved it."
2,Extra Virgin,The writer is way too wordy and it detracts from the enjoyment of the story. I couldn't get past the distraction of her over flowery descriptions. :(
3,Too wordy,"After reading other books of this nature, I found this one to be too wordy, too boring filled with descriptions of trivial things. I found myself skimming forward all too often."
3,Hard to get into...,"I bought this book with the hopes of enjoying it while sitting on the beach. Perhaps the genre wasn't exactly my idea of 'beach read' material -- I ended up trekking to the bookstore for another book. However, I did come back to Extra Virgin -- just couldn't get the characters and their adventures out of my mind. As a result, I'll buy the sequel. It just wasn't as much of a page turner as I had hoped."
2,"Deja vu, all over again","It's tough to find much redeeming in another one of these ""expat moves to crazy but poetic italy"" books.Hawes is a skilled writer and tale teller but you'd really have to be a fan of the genre to get through almost 400 pages of quirky anedotes by an author who refers to her Italian neighbors as ""peasants."" Even her considerable wit makes for an ""been, there done that"" reaction--yet again the Anglo-American expat who never manages to get inside the culture..."
3,Languishing in Liguria,"The idea of 2 English women living in northern Italy sounds like a romp but, it quickly became tiresome. For me, each minute detail of their life among the Italians became old. As the book progressed, the author seemed to be reaching for topics...did we really need a chapter on building concrete steps? Very disappointing."
2,Overpriced and overrated!,"When this book was available at every bookstore for a few bucks, it was worth a read... but for a super-thin book (a glorified pamphlet, really) that is full of factual errors, it's simply absurd to see it selling for over a hundred dollars. Sure, its out of print. If you're a book collector with too much money, maybe that would make it worth the price... but thats really the only thing going for it. Wait for a reprint, or better yet, buy a different book that has a higher quantity and quality of information."
1,KW Yogi,"Don't be fooled by the photo, they look like they are cute, cropped and snug fitting but they are long, baggy and ugly. Returned them the same day I received them."
5,Must Have!,This is a must have book for any born again believer or the person seeking to get out of the rat race and learn to prosper God's way!
1,Wrong message,"I bought this little booklet at a christian bookstore. It upsets me to see these Word-Faith teachers materials in our christian book stores. Prosperity is not God's will for you. God's will for you is to be saved and find all of your riches in Jesus, not money. In this booklet, Hagin tells his conversation with his god about how he supposed to be rich. Jesus totally despises this teaching in Matt. 6:19-21. Don't fall for this prosperity gospel."
3,Book,Good book but expected a full version they are more like pamphlets. Good reading though. Good for the price. Good
2,A kick is no longer a kick!...,"Whoaaa.... Not a lot to say about this game... A cool weapon attack looks like a slap in the face (and sometimes sounds like one too!), kicks are just a mess, jump attacks are ninja pro (but just a bit too much ninja for the Ninja Turtles...) , and i dont even know WHAT happens in a combo attack; suddenly my enemy just falls down and then MAGICALLY comes right back up.... Okay kinda creepy...The game (on some maps) randomly like freezes! And then suddenly im knocked down! Its actually kinda fun on some maps, if they would just play well! Weapons are kinda lame, you dont even know what youre picking up, not much guidance, etc...I dont know about this game... I really dont... Its kinda hit or miss... If it sounds fun, get it, but be warned, it might just kick you in the face if you arent paying attention!"
1,Midwestern author,"I will not review the story but want to comment on the quality of this edition. The book was difficult to hold open to read. A quarter of the way through the book, the binding came loose; first in sections, then by pages. It cannot be passed along to others to read because it is literally in 217 separate pieces. The print is small"
2,Drowned in clutter,"This novel was promising at the outset, and there were parts of it that I enjoyed reading. However, I became more and more dissatisfied as the story progressed. The pacing was extremely erratic, and some of the important events seemed ill placed. The author often led me to think that certain characters and events were significant when they were not -- so many side plots were opened and never closed. I felt it difficult to feel sympathetic toward the characters that the author clearly wanted her audience to sympathize with.It truly would have been a satisfying novel if it weren't so crowded and disjointed."
2,Doesn't live up to adventures of Freckles,"Did not enjoy this as I did the more gritty tale of Freckles, not such a rattling good tale."
3,Girl of the Limberlost paperback,The book is a wonderful classic book but the reprinting of it was not too great. The font is very hard to read and there are hardly any margins. I know the publisher was trying to save money and make the book inexpensive but next time I will buy an old used hardback copy.
5,"fast delivery, good condition","The book arrived in a timely fashion, and in great condition! I am very happy with my purchase. I'm looking forward to reading this book with my daughter!"
4,the girl of the limberlost,if you like green living this book is it to the hilt. it is an older book that rings so true to what we can do to live a greener life today. the girl in the story is a naturalist with a deep and abiding respect for nature and a desire to understand and experience all of the limberlost. it takes you on a journey from becoming a high schooler to gradutation and beyond into her life becoming an adult. i enjoyed it as a youngster and now as the adult. i live close to where the story takes place and visited the state historic site and it really brought it all to life.A Girl of the Limberlost
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable Story,"I had read this book in the 1950's when I was a teenager. I loved it, and wondered if I would still like it as an adult. Now, being able to appreciate the 19th century thought that went into it, I think I like it even more. It is wonderfully written, and one of those stories that just leave you feeling good. This time around, I took the time to check out what/where the Limberlost was, the history of Gene Stratton Porter, etc., and it added to the enjoyment. Sometimes you really can't beat the old classics."
3,Books,"The book was as good as I remember it when I read it as a child. My only complaint is that I ordered large print and as it might have been a little bigger than normal font, it was not big enough."
4,Naturalist message is timeless,"This classic of Indiana literature was published in 1909 so is a little stilted and dated but gives a wonderful glimpse into life in the early 1900's. It has a strong ecological message that nature has spiritual and restorative powers. It's a little moralistic, which is probably typical of the era it was written. I can see why it was one of the popular books of its time."
4,a Girl of the Limberlost,This was a book My mother spoke about in the 1930S This is the first time I ever saw it. I found it very interesting .
5,Citrine necklace,"This necklace is beautiful. I bought this for someone to wear with a gold dress knowing that they only wear silver. The stone is a bit less ""yellowy"" than the photo would suggest. Looked great next to gold fabric."
2,News from Nowhere Utopian Novel,"It is easy to find great dystopian novels, but I wanted to read an utopian novel. I was a bit disappointed. It fell a little flat and it probably had to do with it being written in 1890. William Morris was disgusted by the industrial revolution and the poor social and environmental ills that manifested from it, so he attempted to write about a world that reverted back to an agrarian life. I just thought it was a bit of a cop out. I would rather read about a utopian novel where the people achieved some sort of enlightenment and learned moderation or something than to completely do away with technology all together. I don't see modernization as evil it is the people and how they choose to use it that creates the problem. I think my favorite utopian novel remains a book I read as a child, The 21 Balloons by William Pène du Bois."
2,Caution!,"Well, as a subscriber to the digital version of the Artist's Magazine...it may seem like a good deal, but this company is totally unreliable and do not respond to your email inquiries if you have a problem. I purchased the download version in September...and have YET to receive notice of when it will start...and no one will reply to my emails. How is that for customer service!Just buy it on the magazine shelf...when you feel inspired...the download version is a total unreliable rip off. Too bad..good magazine, but customer service is non existent."
4,"Great Magazine, Poor Experience","I ordered this year-long subscription with high hopes. I got two magazines, and then nothing after that. I order it in January 2009, and only received two issues... I haven't received a magazine in over six months, and I don't know who to complain to."
5,Great magazine,"I have received my first issue of The Artist's Magazine, for January/February 2008. I am especially enjoying the article on Collage. I am well satisfied with my purchase and would think most anyone interested in Art would find The Artist's Magazine, both entertaining and instructional."
3,Good magazine with some problems,I like the magazine and it has nice articles with good photographics. I would recommend this magazine if they would address my problems with getting all my issues. I think that is a legitimate concern for future subscribers.
3,art magazine review,The Artist's MagazineI was expecting more from this magazine but it gives a good general view of different art work and views for different tastes in art.
3,Good for beginners and weekend painters,"I hadn't bought the magazine in a a number of years and after I read the first few issues I realized why - Artist's Magazine isn't meant for people who are professional artists really. It appears to be designed for people who are older, inexperienced, weekend painters - people who don't have a college education but are just above beginner.I was hoping for information geared towards experienced, career driven artists and not just simplistic lessons on how to do the basics."
4,Nice gift,"Got this as a gift for my mom who just took up painting. She called to say she got two issues at once, which isn't great because you pay a hefty price for only 6 months of issues and she got one third of the gift at once. She said it's neat and there are a lot of things she's never seen before like names of brush strokes and styles. She excited, so I'm excited. Just wished the first issue would have come sooner."
4,Solid and interesting artists publication,"Whether you are a novice or a pro, this magazine is a must. It is not overly technical and it features a variety of media. I am a faithful reader and I frequently commend it to others. My only gripe is the inconsistency of writing. Some articles are little more than glorified captions for a few photographs of an artist's work. Other articles do an excellent job of explaining what the artist did to get the wonderful effect displayed in the photographs of the artwork. I'm more interested in technique than the artist's background and training. All in all, though, buy it you'll like it."
3,"Not awesome, not awful",A fairly decent magazine. A little ad heavy. Not enough information about techniques. Artist profiles would be more useful and instructive if they included more about the artists' techniques and not just backgrounds/philosophies. Not bad for the beginner.
1,"past/back issues subscription sent, not new","I ordered a one year subscription to Artists magazine on dec. 5, 2011. In january 2012 I was sent 6 magazines from as far back as july 2011. All six came in one week. The labels show an end of subscription date of june 2012. That is only 6 months from the time of order placement. Starting a new one year suscription in january shouldn't end in june. Three of these issues I already own; bought them on the news stand.Very disappointing. Don't order from Amazon unless you like reading back issues of a magazine!"
3,Interesting piece of American history,"Overall this was a pretty good book. Though it seemed a little disjointed at times, it was interesting reading about some Oklahoma history that usually isn't addressed.The book discusses some of the most notorious black and Indian outlaws (and lawmen) of the Indian (and then Oklahoma) territory. I must admit that I had not heard of most of the names. I was surprised to read of how many black men had served as deputy United States Marshals in this region before statehood.The author seems to have done extensive research on the subjet, and quotes regularly from newspaper articles and other writings from the late 1800's and early 1900's."
5,Great history,"I wrote to Clint Eastwood and begged him to read this book and to consider making a movie of the great stories recorded by Mr. Burton. Any reader that is interested in the Indian Country era or our nation, will not be disappointed by reading this book."
5,"""Love is short, forgetting is so long""","Seven Principles of Leave No Trace provides the listener with a heavenly haunting of pure gorgeousness. This incredible album has been playing in my head non-stop for a month now and I can't seem to get enough of it. Every time I listen, track by track, it grows in beauty. From ""Secrets"" to ""Brooklyn Flowers,"" each song leaves a bittersweet fog around your soul. And it clings to you all day and night. I strongly believe that everyone should give a gift to themselves and purchase this album as well as the first Self-Titled Debut."
1,Very Low Quality,I was very disappointed in this fan. Right out the box I noticed that it looked like a cheap plastic fan.It looks better in the picture. I tried it anyway. As soon as I turned it on one of the two fan motors made a whining noise when running.The motor noise was just too much to bear and I had to return it to Amazon for a refund.I would try another fan from Amazon of from a local store where you can get a better idea of the quality.
1,Not Quite As Advertised,"The product description says that it will fit windows up to 40"" wide. It does not. You'll have a 2"" to 3"" gap on both sides of your window if you try to install it in a window 40"" wide. Beyond that...I'd say you can probably find a better quality fan anyway. The construction feels kind of cheap."
3,Nice Fan,"Although this was a fairly nice fan; it was strongly built. Handle feels flimsy and I had to take special care moving it around. The feet were two small pieces that kept coming off. Once in the window, however, it cooled the small bedroom well."
3,not enough power,I purchased this fan for an exhaust fan. It works ok but it needs more power to pull the smoke out. I am a smoker and want a exhaust fan that REALLY works! It is fine if all you want is a fan.
2,Read The Reviews. Avoid Surprises.,"After reading other customer reviews of this product, I expected cheesy. I wasn't even slightly disappointed. Low quality plastics and limited versatility earn this product 2 stars.It is, however, inexpensive and moves a reasonable amount of air. Well suited for the intended application in my garage to extract heat and fumes. In addition, it is not too loud and doesn't rattle.If your expectations are sufficiently low, this could be a good purchase. Free shipping tipped the balance for me.An unexpected bonus was the humor displayed by the manufacturer - The instructions state that it should not be used near a window."
1,Junk,"I purchases this fan to relieve smoke in my man cave for football games. It whined its eay through the first time, the second time 1 fan broke off and crashed into the other 1. Don't throw your money away on this."
3,Decent.,"Instructions are useless. I can't figure out how to clear the timer. You'd think by pressing ""resent,"" but no...This has an annoying ""beep!"" with each push of every button; seems there is no way to turn this off.Nice feel to buttons. ""Mode"" button is in a very annoying spot.This has time, alarm, pacer, timer, and stopwatch.I may return it, though I like the pacer option.I feel this item is overpriced."
2,Had to return it!,"The main fault with the one that I received was that the modes kept changing on their own. The watch would jump from Stopwatch to Clock to Timer even when the watch was at rest. Evidently, there was a short in the wiring. The stopwatch mode worked fine, but I could not rely on it."
4,chronometer accusplit muy bueno,Bueno lo que les puedo decir del producto que es muy bueno su envio fue satisfecho y que la calidad del mismo es superior a los otros gracias!!
5,J. R. R. Tolkien is a literary genuis!,"I'm am 13 years old and I have read this book 37 times! I loveit! It is an excellent book to read if you love fantasy. I love Elvesand Dragons. And most of the creatures of Middle Earth are so original and captivating that one can't help but love them. This book was one I could not put down! The detail makes it a difficult book for some, but if you have time on your hands it is a good suggestion. And the Lord of the Rings continuing afterwards is even better, but the Hobbit is a sort of introductory to these books as well as a story in it's own. I highly recommend that you not think about reading it and go on! You won't be disappointed! It is a masterpiece, a novel telling the story of Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, Goblins, Men, a Dragon and a wizard called Gandalf. It transports you to the mystical land of Middle Earth where only your door seperates you from adventure and danger. It is very imaginative as well as wonderous. An absolute must-read! -Bonnie Adams"
3,Meh,"Wasn't half as good as I expected it to be. I love the other books and Lord of the Rings, but I found it to move slowly and hard to get in to."
5,Tastes great in everything!,I love this in baked goods. I would recommend this to anyone who can not have sugar in their diet.
5,Truly The Ultimate Sweetener!,"Trying to cut back on sugar, but love to bake. This product is expensive, but worth it. It doesn't give sugar highs/lows and looks and tastes like real sugar. Use it without any adjustments in any recipe and it doesn't give off a bitter after taste in my morning coffee."
5,Great oil filter,"The folks at O'Reilly swear by Wix products - even over some of the more expensive filters. I've never had anything but good luck with the Wix filters, so I continue to use them. I change my oil every 7500 with synthetic, usually Mobil1. When I pull out the old filter, it always looks like it's still in very good condition. The filter appears very well constructed with a good number of pleats. There's a great website that compares various filters to the Wix. The guy slices them up, and compares many different aspects of the filters. Wix is a solid filter, no matter who you compare it to. Feel free to check out the link: [...]"
3,decent quality,As someone who works in manufacturing engineering this item is grossly overpriced for its manufacturing costs. It cost half as much to make this as a metal cased filter yet is the same cost or more.
1,Get a well-qualified piano teacher,"If you really want to learn to PLAY (not bang on) the piano, get a well-qualified piano teacher instead of a product like this. You really need a teacher to show you how to play with proper technique and style. There's no such thing as a short-cut piano method; not if you're serious about playing expressively, that is."
5,A life-changing book,"Yet another of Mrs. Heald's inspired Bible studies, this one has revolutionized my prayer life. It especially helped me to begin to recognize the enormous role that the Holy Spirit wants to play in my prayers, and how through prayer itself He can increasingly conform me to Christ. I am preparing to lead a small group Bible study using the book, and I expect God to do more life changing--that is my prayer. I would encourage any woman who wants to grow in Christ to study this book."
1,Enough Wild Antics!,"Anjalie Cantrell, a rich merchant's daughter from Jamaica, crosses words with the homely, arrogant and stuffy Viscount, Lord Chance. Anjalie tries to make everyone dance to her tune. Even Lord Chance admits to that and, too bad for the reader, they are not very interesting or reasonable tunes at that. Is Anjalie supposed to be considered smart because she gets people to do what she wants? It was tiring to have to read 230 pages of what is supposed to be considered wit and good writing. Anjalie and Lord Chance were both arrogant, his sister just simply stupid and the plot actually boring. Where was the humor? Darcy wearing a foot-wide cravat? While most regencies or love stories in general need a plot that enables the characters to develop their relationship, one in which the hero and heroine constantly aruge seems a waste of space. They do not even seem to like each other and why should they? I wouldn't. Fortunately, most people do not conduct their courting that way."
4,Thinking Differently Pays Off,The clever use of photography and the arrangement of the words is enough to entice any reader. The author makes you want to follow in the footsteps of the main character and think differently. Excellent suspense and humor - an excellent book.
2,did this already,"sent this in already, why do i keep getting asked for this review,(and others), over and over again?? it's annoying; i've done my bit. what's up here??"
1,Junk,"I am more disappointed with this 15 dollar knife than I thought was possible. When the blade is out, the liner lock slips all the way across the bottom of the blade where it would normally ""lock"" and gets stuck between the back and the inside of the handle. Closing the knife after this happens is very difficult and results in a torn up thumb. It is also very hard to open the knife even after loosening the torx screw, applying oil and repeatedly opening and closing the knife to try and break it in.I was not expecting much from a $15 knife, but I was expecting it to at least work. It now does nothing but sit in a box, which proves its uselessness considering a knife is a tool that can complete a million tasks."
2,This is an ABRIDGED version of the play!,"Shakespeare, as ever, is brilliant, and this version of Antony and Cleopatra is reasonably acted. However, be forwarned, that in spite of the misleading claims on the packaging of these cassettes, labeling them an ""unabridged classic"", this is actually a significantly ABRIDGED version of the play. ""Unabridged"" here apparently means they have not shortened the production by the Canadian Broadcasting Company that is presented on the cassettes. This version of the play is also ""adapted for audio"" by speaking stage directions in a number of places, or making other changes in the text so the listener without a transcript can better know what is going on. Some may find this useful, but Shakespeare purists will definitely want to look elsewhere for a recording of this play."
2,Did not work for swelling.,I have genetic lymphedema in one leg. Tried Capisette for 5 months with no appreciable difference in swelling. Nothing else has worked very well either.
1,Did not work for me,I tried this product to reduce the amount of fluid I was retaining. I was very disappointed with the results. Capisette did not work for me at all.....Sorry!
5,the most beautiful I've ever heard,"There are no words adequate to describe the feelings I have when I close my eyes and listen to the music of Giovanni. I am trying desparetly to find his other album, ""Always"". that album is also too beautiful to describe. Why is it so hard to get? Music that beautiful should be around all the time. Help in locating it would be greatly appreciated. (Not Always & Forever;I have that)"
1,Beware,"The listing is for a CD by the Band Of The Army Air Corps (UK). The description is for a more interesting recording by the Band Of The Royal Logistics Corps. The marches listed on the cover illustration don't match the track listing. I contacted Amazon regarding this. They replied they saw no problem. I would have liked the Logistics Corps recording, but I don't know which one would have been sent, so I didn't order."
5,hood lift cylinder,"Old cylinders were worn out, on 2002 Dodge ram. Hood almost hit me several times, Ordered the Strong Arm 4634, cylinders, and the problems are solved, Low cost, easy install, could not be better."
3,It gets the job done.,They are strongarm for sure. I darn near bent my hood trying to close it for the first time. I would probably go to the dealer next time.
5,As good as OEM,Product arrived today and I had it installed in only a few minutes with no special tools. Great product at a great price.
5,Hood lift supports,"Very quick delivery, excellent product! Replaced the worn supports on my 2005 Ram. Took about 10 minutes to install (that long only because it took a few minutes to support the hood properly to install the first one). As other reviewers mentioned, these seem better than the original OEM supports."
1,A complete miss,"This is a film cheaply shot on video with a self-satisfied slacker take on Burning Man by a 1st time visitor. It captures some of the irreverence and irrelevance of the festival, whichI guess is what they thought was important, and absolutely none of the import (especially in these times) nor wonderment of it. The environmental philosophy of ""Leave no trace"", the rather radical gift economy, not to mention the unbridled creativity and visual awesomeness of the art (and land), are barely given a nod. I was very disappointed with this film."
1,waste of time,"i love the burning man festival- but this dvd is a complete waste of time and money! it's basically a narcissistic story about 3 guys' trip to the festival in 1995, and how they returned to create a minor theme camp in 1996. it's pathetically self centered, and misses the point ot the festival entirely. save your money for some beer instead."
5,Luscious Lincoln Center!,"Being a big fan of all the daring new musicals that are being produced Lincoln Center Theatre...the brilliance of ""A New Brain"" came as no surprise to me. An unlikly subject for a musical to be sure...but this is a score full of soaring melodies and some of the most plain old fun songs that I have ever heard. Enjoy this splendid recording...every moment is sheer joy!"
5,Just plain wonderful.......,"I was so familiar and fond of Falsettoland, that when I first put this on, I turned it right off, because the beginning songs have so many musical strains of F/Land. Well how dumb am I? For some reason, I gave it another try and now I'm in love with the CD and fabulous Finn. That one stanza from And They're Off (you all know which one I mean) is just perfect and I could listen to it constantly. I still need to spend a lot of time with this CD as there's so much there, but I highly recommend it."
4,I'm having frog hallucinations!,I love this. Kristen Chenoweth is hilarious and great. Malcolm Gets is fabulous. William Finn (the compuser) is incredibly talented
4,and they're off!,"OK, I was so busy praising this musical I forgot to mention my favorite song. ""And They're Off"" is unbelievable--a driving melody conveying all the anger and processed-only-of-late acceptance of the stormy relationship of the lead character's parents. ""There was blood on the ground,"" yes, but also, ""we laughed a lot, that's the part I forgot to tell you."" This is the first theater song in 20 years that has reminded me of the songs of ""A Chorus Line,"" with its honest confessional tone, thinly veiled anger, and humor from a character who is so proud to be--finally--""looking back."" I love this song, and Malcolm Gets does it for all it's worth."
4,astonishing,"Listen to the humor and sheer love of life--and all its quirkiness--in this musical. You'll be amazed at the wisdom, the melody, the frankness about ""relationships,"" and the performances, most notably Malcolm Gets, Penny Fuller, Chip Zien, and Norm Lewis (oh, that man can sing!). When Penny Fuller sings to her dying son that he should ""fly with the man"" who has asked him to sleep in his arms, it made at least this listener-who has lived for 20 years with his parent's vocal acceptance of his homosexuality-weep. And then there's ""Sailing."" What riches in this musical! I can't wait to see it performed, somewhere!"
4,"Haunting melodies, great cast","I really love this piece! My only complaint is Kristen Chenowyth is underutilized, but other than that, some really great songs. ""Heart and Music,"" ""I Feel So Much Spring Within Me,"" and ""Gordon's Law of Genetics"" (really fun) are all great. My favorite, however, is ""And They're Off."" Amazing!I wake up with a song from this musical in my head almost every morning. I haven't listened to it since last weekend, but today (5 days later), I awoke with Kristen singing ""I love Mr. Bungee"" in my head. It makes waking up early a lot easier!Thank you, William Finn, for another wonderful musical that makes being a theatre fan so worth it!! I hope I'm able to see a production of this piece one day..."
4,You may need a new Brain after listening to this,"While listening to this, you'll be a little (okay, a LOT) hesitant at first. BUT! It is great. Once you've heard Will Finn's music, you will be changed. Creative, darkly humerous, just corny enough to not scare you off. Think of music from a basic book musical mixed lyrics from something like Avanue Q. It's a great combination and a HIT!"
3,Listen to a friends copy,"Although the subject matter is a bit of a downer the music was pretty good. I did notice several of the songs were from Finn's previous work with new lyrics. The best song of the show was ""Sailing"" and the finale was also good. Many of the songs were pointless and didn't relate well as a full rounded score."
5,Everything you'd expect and more!,"William Finn is brilliant! I absolutely love the lyrics to the songs in this musical. I know most reviewers claim that's where he lacks, but I think they're very witty and honest! The characters develop very nicely, from Rhoda to Mr. Bungee to Roger and Mimi and of course, Gordon. I first heard of this musical when my friends used it for their forensics piece...and I loved it! I had to order it! It's great music and talented vocals really caught my attention!"
4,"Saw the show, bought the CD","While in NY on business, I happened upon opening night of this wonderful show. Touching, hilarious, and full of great music, I loved it. Try it, you'll find some delightful tunes and profound thoughts."
4,Mine isn't the most educated of tastes but...,"I'm not actually a Finn fan or even a Sondheim fan simply due to a lack of exposure to their music. Still, I enjoyed this CD for it's catchy, upbeat tunes. There's a sweet story and seemingly unrelated songs are cleverly woven together into a surprisingly coherent plot. The music wasn't the grand, sweeping stuff I've heard alot of lately, but has complexities and originality that a lot of the more commercial stuff has lost. I was pleasantly surprised at the results of ordering ""A New Brain"" on a whim, mostly due to the intriguing title. The music was well worth it."
4,"""A NEW BRAIN"" needs a run on the Great White Way!","This musical has some of the most beautiful and well orchestrated music I have ever heard! The ballads are beautiful and the cast is brilliant (especially Kristen Chenoweth). I am a big fan of the up tempo songs in this show, my favorites: ""GORDO'S LAW OF GENETICS"" and ""AND THEY'RE OFF!"" The final song, ""I FEEL SO MUCH SPRING"" gives the musical so much meaning. It is amazing that this musical has not been given a chance on Broadway."
4,pace changing tale,"Tom McCullough is a ranger. While on patrol, he hears a scream and rushes to find a young woman being threatened by a man with a spear. She had trespassed on an ancient and sacred Aboriginal ceremony site. What seeming begins as a contemporary romance quickly shifts.His rescue start a wonderful tale, with strong paranormal threads. The woman Tom has rescued is Princess Shara of Q'aresh. She is hiding, because her father is planning on marrying her off to a man she knows is trying to overthrow her father's reign and seize control of his country.It was a little jarring to be in the mind set of a contemporary romance and suddenly you have to shift gears and enter this almost faerytale story of the runaway princess, but Ramin's writing quickly wins the reader over in this most engaging tale."
5,Old wave-neolectro!,I ve always been a fan but this album really pulled my ear to the beat. A mixture of old new wave upbeat with disco electro house. If you like something different this year.. this is the album to buy and listen.
4,Great music,"This was the first CD I ever heard from LCD Soundsystem and once I did, I was hooked. Excellent music has made me a fan."
3,???,"Okay, I can maybe see the yuppie, artsy, weirdo people who're different just to be different get into this, but otherwise I just don't see the big deal about this album. It's okay, but nothin' to praise or get awards over. All this is, is a gateway album for people that don't normally listen to electronic music to do so. That's all fine & dandy, but don't give away any awards over it. The music is okay, the lyrics...well for the most part are okay, but the guy's voice makes you wanna go start punching people, kinda like when someone's running their finger nails down a chalkboard. For the most part, this is just really mediocre stuff. I just don't see what the big deal is. If you wanna praise an electronic album, there are far more far superior albums that deserve your attention & praise."
2,Not That Great,"I read the reviews of this cd and expected to get something I did not. My favorite track was ""Us v. Them"" which sounds a bit like a poor man's Talking Heads. The songs tend to get monotonous and the vocals do not seem appropriate to the music at all, in fact they got on my nerves most of the time. If you want a great electronic/dance/rock cd check out MGMT's first full length LP Oracular Spectacular. I has everything that Sound of Silver lacks and a lot more."
2,Unimpressed,I feel like I've already heard this before... After several listens it still doesn't grab me... just sorta bores/depresses me...
3,Not enough LCD for the buck!,"I happened to catch LCD Soundsystem at Lollapalooza 2007 in Chicago and was incredibly impressed with their live set. They had an immense amount of energy onstage and frontman James Murphy really knows how to get a crowd going. Unfortunately, this album doesn't do the greatest job of capturing that energy. It seems to amble at times, a song seeming like its going to hit the mark, and then missing. Now, there are a few gems here, esp. North Americans and Time to Get Away. But after that, much of the songs seems to flow together into one homongeous and rather unimpressive glob of post-punk electro.Far worse then any of the above though, is the fact that the album contains only NINE TRACKS! I missed this detail when purchasing and MAN, do I feel ripped off. This should be an EP and a single, not an album. A disturbing lack of content like this is just not fair to the fans."
2,"Undercooked, Overrated","Aside from ""North American Scum,"" the beats are boring and repetitive, and the rhymes are nothing special. ""North American Scum"" is a five-star song, but ""Sound of Silver"" is a two-star album."
5,Quite a surprise,"When I gave this record a spin, it was a sigh of relief. I had noticed James Murphy as LCD Soundystem when I heard some of his superb singles that came out before his debut album. Enjoying these singles a lot, I purchased his debut album and I was quite disappointed with the first disc (the new material), although the collection of singles on Disc 2 was worth the price. I wasn't expecting much out of his second album, figuring that his flame had quickly burnt out after those first few singles. Giving this album a spin, I was surprised that he could write such great songs. I mostly enjoyed his long dance/rock freakouts but didn't know that he could write such brilliant pop songs. This album is a surprisingly exciting listen."
4,Entertaining Derivative,"A fun and entertaining album, especially if you like 80s electronic pop bands. Many of the songs sound like tribute pieces to various bands of that era (Kraftwerk, Human League, New Order, even the B-52s), and I can't imagine this album existing without those influences. One star off for that, but four stars on for the catchiness of the cuts, the variety of sonic styles, and the witty lyrics."
5,Got me into electronic,"I was one of those classic rock guys that thought the vast majority of new music sucked. Then one of my friends forced me to consume LCD Soundsystem and I realized that the new music revolution is here and it involves people with laptops. The first listen might be a little awkward, but before you know it, you're dancing on the street, laughing at lyrics that are too real and finding yourself becoming... an electronic music fan.Check out the ""Bunch of Stuff"" remixes. They break it wide open."
4,More focused LCD (4.5 stars),"The second LCD full length is at once a more daring record, but also a more focused record. The most rewarding thing about the first album was the inclusion of all LCD's previous vinyl releases collected on the bonus disc. The self titled debut itself was strong in places, but unfocused, and not much linked the various styles together. Here, on the new record, LCD is able to create a record that wanders through various styles and yet somehow manages to still work as a larger whole. Murphy's vocals are alot stronger, and the sound is overall alot fuller without being overdone. The slower songs are better, and the digital madness more infectious than ever. Overall, it is much more focused and rewarding effort from LCD. Highly recommended for fans of the first album and newcomers alike."
4,Sound of Silver Talk to Me,"What an infectious dance album LCD Soundsystem (aka James Murphy) has made. Fresh, cool, and solid through and through. It definitely gets your hipster arts and crafts party started any day of the week!Get Innocuous! 10/10 a tidal wave of electro blissTime to Get Away 10/10 Thumping-shake-your-ass-kind-of-songNorth American Scum 9/10 Oh where to begin?Someone Great 10/10 Exquisitely beautifulAll My Friends 11/10 very ""New Order-ish"" and an easy standout among the restUs vs Them 10/10 Funky (like how that chick from 'Ghost World' says it!Watch the Tapes 10/10 a short and sweeet goodySound of Silver 9/10 head bobbin'-shoulder-poppin' awesomenessNew York, I love you but you're bringing me down 10/10 wonderful cabaret-style ending"
2,Sound of Boredom,"LCD Soundsystem - Sound of Silver (2007)I like dance music, but this CD is just too repetitive. True, there are some cool sounds, but nothing I haven't heard before. In fact, this James Murphy character cribs plenty from other artists. I can't always put my finger on it, but much of what I hear on this album rings a bell of familiarity. For example, I hear some elements of Can (and Murphy doesn't hide his affection for that group either).Having influences isn't in itself a problem; everyone has influences. But you have to build on those influences and take them in different directions for the music to be worthwhile. Everything on this record makes me think, ""been there, done that."" True, the songs do subtly evolve, but the repetitive elements are so prominent that they render the album monotonous. I much prefer dance music that has more to offer in the way of actual songs."
5,By far one of the best guitar players recorded,"Leward Kaapana is truly one of the best guitar players around. This CD is for anyone who loves great quality music. I've given this CD to many friends as gifts and they all come back to ask ""does he have other CD's you'd recommend?"" My answer is 'Yes, everyone is worth buying!"""
5,waltz of the wind,i love this song; my husband has been looking for it for so many years; but this is the first time iv'e found it. can you tell me the ariginal artist. and how can we puchase this song waltz of the wind. thank you mary tandle
1,Caveat Emptor!!!,"Buyer Beware! The product description for this item is very misleading, as is the picture shown. This is not, in fact, a seat cover that allows you to use your console, but a SOLID BENCH cover. I have tried for several weeks to exchange this item, but it seems that it is always after business hours at this seller's location, and messages left on the answering machine as well as via e-mail are ignored. If you do want a solid bench seat cover, however, this item looks good, and seems like a good quality buy."
5,Yiddish Poetry,"We didn't realize when we ordered the CD that it would be a series of Yiddish poems set to music by Chava Alberstein; our previous recording by her was a collection of traditional, well-known folk songs and popular songs in Yiddish. So we expected more of the same. But these lyrics are all written by Yiddish poets born at the turn of the 19/20th century, who lived through WW II, people whose names I've never heard of, and who produced a body of writing which is simply gorgeous and full of remarkable turns of phrase and images. I've always loved the Yiddish language, with its capacity for wild humor and heart-breaking sadness; Alberstein's voice captures these traits perfectly, and the arrangements and playing by the Klezmer band behind her is wonderful. It is a moving, haunting and lovely piece of work."
1,Not what I thought it was,Played it once not much to say. I was not impressed it was more of an excersise vid than teaching Zumba. Fine for what it is. Not quite what my wife wanted.
2,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed. It said I would receive two dvds for price, I only received one. It is a 10 min sit-up exercise that shows over and over again. I was thinking the dvd would teach Zumba moves and so on. It is nothing like what was advertise in Amazon.Very disappointed"
1,do not buy,"this is a terrible video...no dancing no real ""zumba"" just stretching exercises. i am returning this for a FULL refund. this video sucks. the cover is false advertising. it says its the best latin music and moves....none of that.....this is not zumba. why would you advertise it as that. TERRIBLE WORST SALE EVER"
1,Disappointed,"I thought that I was purchasing a Zumba dance video, there was not one bit of ""dance"" involved; just a ton of different stretches...total waste of money."
1,terrible quality and not what I wanted.,the dvd was sratched and did not work on my player. It was not the dvd I wanted- I wanted the zumba classes- but that is my fault I shouldnt have gone for the cheaper version. No more buying on line for me.
1,The Zumba Buns DVD,This was the worst I have ever seen. First of all there was no dancing only floor exercises. I could not really get into the exercise because it was in Spanish and English. I want my money back from this product. I will never use it nor tell anyone about it.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"When ordering this DVD I was under the 'assumption' that it was a typcial Zumba exercise tape with the dancing. I was disappointed in playing it that it is all 'on the floor' abs, thighs & buns exercises with no actual dancing exercises.They're good exercises, but not what I expected."
3,Not a dancing Video!,"I hope this will help!This DVD is a set of exercises for buns and thighs,not actual dancing Zumba! So if you looking into dancing routine,check other Zumba listings for sale!"
2,Not what I thought it was,"This is a good warm up video, but I thought it would have some dancing and it had zero. Not what I thought it was going to be."
1,very disappointed,I thought since this was made by Zumba it would be more than just an exercise tape in English/Spanish. I thought some dancing would be involved but was wrong.
2,this is zumba,I can't believe that was zumba had I know it was s floor workout I would not have bought it. It was extremely short and not worth the buy. The seller didn't mention that it was a floor workout either
3,Jumba floor exercises,"I was looking for a Zumba tape to dance to and accidentally bought this one that was all floor exercises for thighs, buns and abs. I think someone more determined would love this to work trouble areas but for someone looking to do some dancing, they will need to buy a dance video."
1,Not an actual workout,My wife uses the Zumba workout for Wii at home but needed a DVD for when she is away from home. She purchased this thinking she was getting a Zumba workout. This DVD contains little more than a warmup followed by credits. If you are looking for an actual workout this is not the DVD to buy.
1,Horrible,I thought I was going to dance instesad im doing a boring workout!! I would of never bought this cd if I knew it was a normal workout!
1,dissatisfied,"This is very misleading..has absolutely nothing to do with zumba, it is just using the zumba name to draw in customers. was a very basic work out that contains such basic moves you dont really even need a dvd to show you how to do them because they are so common, such as regular crunches. I thought it would have at least SOME zumba dancing in it, but there was none!"
1,poor choice,"The price for the product is extremely high for the quality of the workout. You get three exercises for each area (abs, butt, thighs) and the rest of the time is spent listening to the female give the instruction than waiting for the male to give the same instruction in non-english. If I wanted to learn another speaking language I would have bought a tape for that instuction. Also all the exercises that this program provide are well known is other forms (pilates, cal, yoga, spot reduction programs, toning and firming programs) DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FIND ANOTHER DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very Disappointed,"Zumba - Buns, Thighs & AbsThe Zumba - Bun, Thighs & Abs is not what I expected there was no dancing involved. It is just an exercise DVD. Because it said ""Zumba"", I thought it would be a zumba dancing DVD, but I was totally wrong."
1,Don't buy!,"Bought it and quickly returned it. I was under the assupmtion that it being zumba that it had dancing, but no. It was just a full floor and mat routine on stretched for the buns, abs and thighs. They did NOT advertise that well. And to top it off, when I went to return it, they gave me the run around, called me names saying I was stupid for thinking it was dancing and that it was my fault for assuming. They ended up exchanging it for another 5 minute dance dvd. And to top it off, the floor routine wasn't even that good. The dvd was short and contains NO dancing whatsoever! Just automatically take the Zumba name off when considering this DVD. Spend your money on a different brand of dance dvd like dancing with the stars workout or something?!"
1,Misleading!,I really wish the seller would have mentioned it was all floor stretches! I was excited to get started zumba DANCING and there was not 1 move! Definitely returned and would not recommend to buy. You can buy other floor exercises for half the price without the Zumba logo.
2,.....?.....,"This book repeats itself alot.. and goes no where.. with no point in sight.. Hard to understand what he is trying to say.. because the author seems like he is defending himself, instead of sharing his insight. And so he use these fancy complex saying over and over again. I guess we are suppose to be impress with that. I got nothing from this book! Sorry Thomas Troward."
2,Not worth it,"i was told this movie was great, very humorous, but it wasn't. there were a couple parts that were funny, but the quality is terrible (even for a movie made in 1935). it hasn't been cleaned up or repaired at all and it's very, very hard to see. it's not worth the money in the slightest."
5,The endless War on Drugs,"There are certain people who love and collect these government sponsored movies from the 1930's. 'Reefer Madness' is the most famous of these ridiculous pictires, but there are other very good ones, Cocaine Fiends is one of them. All the plots in these movies are the same. A good person (usually a young female) is steered off the wayward path by a slick talking hustler with drugs to sell.In Cocaine Fiends a young girl who runs a restaurant with her mother makes the mistake of hiding a 'dope peddler' from federal agents after a car chase. He offers her some 'headache powder' after the coast is clear. Next thing you know he's telling her she needs to be in the big city and can be in a show. Well her life goes pretty much downhill from there after she becomes a full blown cokehead.These films are enjoyable for me. I find it odd how the 'Good ol' days' and 'Those Simple Times of Yesteryear', were as dangerous and decadant as today."
3,Just What Mom Told You Would Happen...,"COCAINE FIENDS concerns a guy named Eddie and his hopeless search for his ""drugged-out"" sister Jane (Lois January). Jane became a shriveled up sleaze-bucket after being introduced to cocaine by a dope-peddler named Nick (Noel Madison). Along the way, Eddie himself is given cocaine by a girl he meets, sending him deep into the bowels of depravity! Watch and shudder! Extra points for spotting the rodent wallpaper in the notorious ""Dead Rat Cafe""! Thankfully, it's only about an hour long..."
3,movie,its more funny than serious. must have been made when they were high and not thinking straight. overall its not to bad. worth watching at least once
3,DRUG FILM!!!!!,This is a great little anti-drug film. It's a bit difficult to watch due to Alpha's rather poor print. It has also been severely edited.
1,Looks nice,Not what I expected.This bumper was rusting 3 months after I purchased first salt to hit the road. I waxed and cleaned like crazy and couldn't stop it.now 1 year since purchase and I hate to see another winter with it.Not recommended.
4,good things,"Long time MSL subscriber. I get out my dec, dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such. I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper. Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear. I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me. I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine.I haven't really watched the Martha show much, I really enjoyed the original MSL show she started with. Sometimes I get annoyed that the materials seem very exclusive to New York and similiar, but c'est la vie."
5,good reference material,"As an aspiring graphic designer (currently still in art school), I use Martha Stewart Living as a main reference almost on a daily basis. It is probably the best designed, non-art magazine I've ever seen with outstanding photography that is flawless and utterly consistent (in a good way). Kudos to the staff of Martha Stewart Living and even more kudos to Martha! If you can get college kids to enjoy a housekeeping magazine, you're doing something right."
3,This husband is no fan,"This publication is fairly representative of a Martha Stewart universe that is, in my opinion, the heart of evil in America. Martha shares her thoughts on having the finest in hand crafted furniture, culinary delights and entertaining tips. She fails to point out that these labor intensive recipes, decorating tips and party plans are difficult if not impossible to acheive by the modern working woman without the benefit of paid labor. She holds out a standard less than realistic to most families and seems to strive to make women who don't reach her ideal feel deeply guilty.Why not one star? Well, my wife pointed out this recipe for chestnut stuffing in her last issue that was quite good......curse her."
3,A little stale,"I used to really enjoy reading MSL but as of late I find I am looking at this magazine saying, ""Why?"". It has wonderful pictures and a nice layout but many of her decorating ideas and projects are just too cumbersome and really not that interesting. I am finding fewer and fewer interesting articles that I want to read in it. I do however still like the recipes it includes and suggestions for table settings and entertaining. It is worth looking at for those areas but otherwise forget it, save your money."
5,Great all-round homemaking magazine,"Inspiring and beautiful magazine that will help you make your house a home. Although some recipes may be too intricate for some, the feature articles are complemented by superb photography and each issue will contain something of interest for all."
5,Wonderful!,"I really like this magizine. It has lots of pretty easy ideas in it, and their good things section is fantastic. The decorating articles are informative, and I love the did you know section. A wonderful magizine!"
4,"Beautiful, but not always easy to adapt to my life","I really enjoy this magazine because it is so beautiful. It has a lot of great ideas for sprucing up your home, learning new things, cooking, crafts, etc. Each month it has a feature article that goes in depth on a plant or craft or food item that teaches you something new and gives you a background at understanding it better.Some of the crafts, however, are very labor intensive and I don't find them very realistic for the average user. Super craftsy people, however, will find this very inspiring.Despite this, I still enjoy reading it each month."
4,Couldn't find the time,"I subscribed to Martha Stewart Living for two years, I always loved looking at the pictures and reading some of the articles. Dessert of the month always made my mouth water, and I even tried a few of them with great success! However, many of the tips were not useful to me living in an urban apartment setting. And while I liked many of the craft ideas I, unfortunately, never found the time to do many of them."
2,"Too much Martha's life, not enough ""living""","I subscribed hoping for more crafts and good recipes. Her food is bland for the most part or has strange ingredients. The crafts have been scarce and either require a great deal of investment or are just ""temporary"" like place cards. Really who is going to spend six months making every single decoration and place mat for a one evening party? Also the articles on Martha and her family and their awesome homes should be limited to a max of two per year. The frequency of ""how great am I??!"" articles comes across as simultaneously pompous and approval needy - kind of a feat really. Finally, kids playrooms should be designed so kids can play in them... Martha's poor granddaughter can't reach any of the toys in the one recently featured. Makes the mother look more concerned about the room staying neat than entertaining the child."
3,martha martha martha!,"it's true, she's kind of too perfect...i relish stories about how difficult she is. i realize, however, that it comes from pure jealousy. who else but martha can make pine cones and dried grass look glamorous rather than ""kountry""? who but martha can whip up canapes for 40, while shingling her roof and washing her dog? no one. this magazine is for the meticulous, or those lucky souls with tons of extra time on their hands. martha is the leona helmsley of entertaining. be her guest, not one of her staff, and you're guaranteed to be impressed."
1,Apartment Number Issues,"If you live in an apartment, be weary of buying this product. It is sold through 2 vendors before getting to Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Even though I provided the apartment number with the address, the magazine was not delivered. It's been 4 months since I ordered it, and it still hasn't arrived. Calling for help just points fingers at another company (Amazon -> Synapse -> Newsub Magazine -> Martha Stewart)."
2,Will Not Renew...,"I have always enjoyed Martha's ideas, but this magazine is hard to read - it reads very slow. If you enjoy reading 5 full pages about the green pea or the like, then this is the magazine for you. You will find some things that you will think of making (if you have the time), but the impractical things take up most of the magazine. I was disappointed."
1,Cheaper from Stewart's website,"Amazon must think we are fools. It's $4 cheaper directly from Stewart's website.On the other hand, there appear to be a lot of fools here."
2,You'd never expect tackiness,"When the december issue arrived, I flipped open to the Letter from Martha, and after droning on about something or the other, she writes about how she hopes everyone can have their own tradition, by purchasing one of her many Christmas at Kmart lines. TACKY! I had already decided not to renew this mag, because I don't even bother looking at the recipe index anymore, and I feel like the mag has changed their direction towards targeting the older set- with boring, slightly hokey crafts."
1,Where is it????,Have not received yet. Bought for my wife for christmas and we have not received. any idea when it will arrive?
1,amazon bites,"i ordered this for my girlfriend, i'd say we maybe got 6 to 8 issues. theres nothing better than getting cheated. we also ordered parenting magazine and got maybe 4 of them. what i'm getting to is be cautious with amazon and magazine subscriptions"
2,Very disappointed with this magazine.,"I started my subscription to Martha Stewart Living in late 2001.I loved her show on T.V. so thought the magazine would be even better-WRONG.It is full of ads and subscription cards falling out from every page.What little content there is on actual Home & Garden or ""Good things"" is definitly not enough to justify the price of the subscription.I realize that Martha Stewart the name is a bussiness but the Calander of her personal monthly events,all the articles featuring HER home,HER garden,HER dogs and even her Daughters' home-is not really what I was hoping for when it comes to Martha Stewart the Magazine.The pictures are pretty though I will say that but even still-I will let the subscription run out and just watch her TV show for free."
2,Over the top,"As much as I enjoy watching Martha's tv shows and we even turned one of our small bedrooms into a ""craft room"", this magazine is just too much for me. Besides being very expensive, she has filled her magazine with flashy ads for expensive things that are not even offered anywhere near where I live and has reduced the quantity of actual crafts and recipes. How many of us have the ""vintage green stoneware, embroidered linens and fresh-cut flowers that she uses daily? She does however, do a very good job citing where some of the specialty items she uses may be found. I have subscribed and unsubscribed to her more than once, because I would flip through the pages and find very little useful information. I think she is now so incredibly wealthy and isolated from normal people, that she has lost touch with what REAL people's lives are like. Now, when I REALLY want to read one of these magazines, I just read it at the library and this keeps the magazines from collecting dust at my house."
3,"Good, but not THAT good","Martha Stewart Living is a good magazine, but definetely not worth the price you pay. There is an overabudance of advertisements which would lead one to believe that the price should be somewhat lower. In comparison to other magazines of the same content, it looks like they are trying to make a profit from both advertisers and subscribers. However, it does have a lot of good information!"
4,Living It Up,"I have been a long time subscriber to MSL. It isn't very practical for me, but I find the features interesting and inspirational. I'm sure Holly Homemaker or hard core Martha fans have (or make) the time to really do the projects and make the recipes. I like reading it for pure entertainment. There are many things to learn since the magazine has monthly gardening, entertainment, cooking and decorating features. It also gives you a different perspective on the same old stuff. For example, a feature on yarn will give you descriptions on the many different types of yarn, how to pick the right type for your project, different knitting stitches, etc."
4,Good Customer Service,My daughter has been receiving this as a gift from me for 2 yrs. now and loves the magazine. I changed her address when I renewed this for her a couple weeks ago. Last week I got home one evening and found the Nov. and Dec. magazines in MY mailbox. I called the customer service on this as soon as I came in the door and they got the address of the recipient corrected and will resend the December magazine to her.Everyone makes mistakes once in a while but not all companies have customer service that is that efficient. I'm impressed.
2,TOO MANY ADVIRTISMENTS,"I've subscribed over the years - on & off - but I've really gotten tired of the disproportionate pages of advertising vs. information/articles. Stewart defends the need for so much advertising to pay for ""the magazine"" - somewhere Martha forgetssubscribers also pay to keep her publication viable. At $4.95 a copy I don't appreciate nearly half the magazine is ads."
3,not as good as it used to be,"I have been a fan of MSL for 7 years now, and although I will keep buying it along with MS Kids, I do fing they have started to print articles that have been on the magazines on previous years or issues, and it is so annoying. Why would you want to read about the same topic or craft TWICE??? I also agree on the ads, they are SOOO annoying and it bugs me that they are always on the left hand page. If it goes on like this, I will probably have to start browsing through the magazine before buying it, instead of grabbing it and heading straight to the cashier."
4,makes me feel good,"I love the photo work in this magazine. It is so signature ""martha"" and fresh and crisp. It makes me feel good to look at the pictures. I also find that the crafts and recipes are good yet basic, so I feel inspired to let loose and improvise on what's there.In short, this magazine is designed to make people (like me!) feel good, and that is why I like it."
3,Asleep awoke me from a punkless void.,"What happened to good punk rock? I don't know, but here's a fresh song for your coffee grinder. Sounds like a mix of old Blink 182 and Op Ivy. Are you awake?"
4,Good enough,"Rest assured, this album is not as great as ""Start Something"" and especially ""Fake Sound of Progress"" (their best album yet) but it's a solid release. In fact, the only song on here which harkens back to their heavier days a little bit is ""Everyday Combat."" Everything else, well it might turn off those who really cannot stand emo-core. I don't like it too much myself, but Lost Prophets play it out to where it's entertaining. Still, they should have put a couple more heavier songs on this album, ""Start Something"" was softer than ""Fake Sound of Progress"" but at least it had a couple hard-hitting tracks. This one, like I said, really only has one, ""Everyday Combat."" By now I'm sure you've all heard ""Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast)"" and that song will give you some clue as to how the rest of the album sounds. Overall, not a bad album, but it could have been better..."
2,Transmitting at a lower frequency,"First of all let me say that when I heard about this album's coming release, my hopes jumped to an all time high. I had expected something just as good or better than their previous albums.This album had good intentions but it shows that with a news producer, their sound took more of a mainstream hit and fell right among the pop-sounding bands that rule the teen stations. I must say i am disappointed with this album, however there are some decent songs. For example:Everyday Combat is a high energy song that continues a bit from their sound of Start Something. Broken Hearts, Torn Up Letters introduces a more Taking Back Sunday/emo sound to their already alternative agenda and serves for a nice blend. 4 A.M. Forever steers their melancholy intentions with mellow riffs and hard vocal choruses that provide an echo of hope for the album.All in all, I do not recommend this album very highly."
4,Really Good,"I like this album. I was recommended the group and the album by a friend. I am so pleased to have given this a chance. If your thinking about it don't.. just give the album a shot and frequent listen. Theres alot of good songs on here including Rooftops, Can't Stop Gotta Have A Date With Hate and A town called Hypocrisy. I gave this a 4 star rating because I do have other albums that I listen to more. However its by no means a disgrace."
4,"very different, but not bad.","my score for this cd is about 3.5/5. i would prefer to listen to start something and tfsop, but that doesnt stop this cd from being awesome. the biggest thing for me was the emotion. when i listened to the first 2 cds, i got this huge feeling of epicness and many more emotions, but when i listen to this cd, thats about all i do. listen. hopefully next time guys, hopefully next time.the best song on this cd was everyday combat (by far) and the worst is Always all ways. (not saying its bad) a few differences of style was they actually have 2 guitar solos (they arnt that spectacular) and it seems as if they were going for an 80's pop feel on some songs. i dont know either. plus, why the hell did they go all emo? pshh.to sum it up, buy the cd, but you wont be blown away.p.s. where the hell did the little techno peices at the end of each song go? i loved those!"
2,What happened...,"This CD is horrible!So when I popped this CD into the CD player and heard track 1 i was like, this is gonna be pretty good. But after that, the songs started sucking and when i was glad when the horrible CD was finaly over and I didn't have to listen to anymore of Lostprohpets new poppy sound. Lost Prophets has obviously sold out and turned into a stupid poppy-punk band. The only good song on this CD is track one, and thats the only one that sounds like their old stuff. I mean, you listen to Fake Sound of progress and then you listen to this CD, you notice a big difference, and that difference is not good. Trust me, if you're new to Lstprophets don't buy this album. Buy either Fake Wound of Progress or start something or even both, but don;t buy this album if your looking for a good rock album. Again, the only reason this CD has two stars onmy rating is because the first song, the rest of the songs suck.LostProphets, please come out with something better and more original next time!"
1,MISSING IN ACTION- LOST PROPHETS,"This album is quite possibly the worst album I have ever heard and I have heard some bad ones let me tell you! Well the prophets got something right there totally....lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This album is just another example of not being true to yourself or your band. Jumping on what sells and neglecting the fans that made you so popular is just wrong. There was a time when it actually was cool to listen to lost prophets, unfortunately now is not one of them! I don't forsee this changing with these sellouts anytime soon! If you have a quarter, good, because that is about all this album is worth and thats stretching it!"
2,Lame,This is a weak effort by these guys. Very bland and forgettable. Doesn't compare at all to Fake Sound of Progress or Start Something. It's too poppy(only 3 songs sort of rock) and very radio frienldy. A huge disappointment...
2,Worst Album Yet,"Okay, I have always been a fan of the hard rock that the prophets of old produced. Fake Sound of Progress had songs like ""Shinobi vs Dragon Ninja"", ""Kobrakai,"" ""The Handsome Life of Swing,"" and others. The sophomore album, Start Something also had great tracks like ""To Hell We Ride,"" ""Burn Burn,"" and ""Start Something."" Liberation Transmission has very little to no 'hard rock' on it. The only 'hard' song is the first track, ""Everyday Combat."" The rest of the album is just... well, weak. It's very weak. The prophets have lightened up a lot. This album sounds nothing like their older stuff.So, if you are a fan of Fake Sound of Progress and Start Something, avoid this album. You will be disappointed."
5,AMAZING,"There are many people that think that 'Liberation Transmission' is nowhere near as good as 'Start Something.' Well there was a period of time where the only thing I had in my Walkman CD player for seven consecuitive months was Start Something. Every single song from 'Start Something' is practically engraved into my head. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll be the first diehard fan of Start Something to say that Liberation Transmission was even better. Almost every single song has an amazingly catchy chorus, all of them are songs that you can get really into. If your new to Lostprophets, you should definently buy their latest album 'Liberation Transmission' first."
3,"Not bad, but it's no ""Start Something""","To Hell We Ride, Start Something, We Still Kill The Old Way, Burn Burn, Wake Up...what the hell happened. How can the last cd have so many good hard rockers and this one is kind of a letdown. The last two songs are pretty good and a few others but they've totally lost their touch with what they SHOULD be recording."
3,Please enter a name for my review,"I don't know Lostprophets, but I just heard this album at their offical website. After listening to it, this is what I have to say about this band....This band was OK, but too much of punk, and I usually listen to punk. Songs ""Everday Combat"" and ""Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast)"" were the best tracks in this album. And song ""4 AM Forever"" had a guitar solo. Lostprofets is just OK, but great. Sometimes they can get a little boring, since their songs are usually long, like song ""Always All Way"", a soft track. But I will advice you not to spend your money on this."
1,"Very disapointing, I hated it.","No offense to anyone that like this album, but this album has to be the worst one I've ever heard. I heard the song ""Rooftops"" and I loved it, so I got the CD. Bad idea. I've never listened to any of their other CD's, but by what I heard on this CD, I don't think I really want to. Please save your money if you haven't bought it already. The CD is very disapointing."
3,iffy....,"The Lostprophets new album ""Liberation Transmission"" had the possibility to be a great album, but one factor lacked in the album that people may not realize effects it. The production of this album is AWFUL. It's unclear, clouded, and seems almost novice. I honestly feel if they had stuck with the same production style as albums like ""Start Something"" this album could be/have been huge. You live and you learn though."
2,Big disappointment,"The Lostprophets third cd is not even close to how great their first 2 cds are. The first 2 songs were on the right track, and Rooftops is obviously a single. But what else is there? 4AM Forever and Can't Catch Tomorrow are good songs but not too great, and Everybody's Screaming is ok. The rest of the cd is forgettable filler or emo trash. The fact that this cd isn't up to par isn't even the worst part, because every band makes a forgettable cd at some point. But this cd will probably be popular amongst the teenage girls, and thus their concerts will be filled with these annoying ""fans"" and all of their cds will end up being just like this one. I hope it doesn't happen."
1,Anyone remember LOZT PROPHETZ?,"Naah probably not, but that's what these guys were called 4 or 5 years ago when they were a bouncy Incubus-like rap metal band. Kinda funny how soon things change and what is hot is suddenly not, isn't it? So before you could say ""Fake American accent"" the ""Prophetz"" traded their baggy cargo pants for skin-tight faded jeans, their Ibanez and PRS guitars for vintage Gibsons and Fenders, traded their angsty nu-metal lyrics for crybaby emo ones and even traded their turntables for keyboards. Isn't bandwagon jumping fun?Avoid this garbage like SARS mixed with Avian Flu"
3,Mediocre at Best,"Although not a huge fan of the Lostprophets, I bought this album for my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. I've listened to it several times and I must say it's not the best music in the world. Although there are several good songs ""rooftops"" the rest of the CD just seems to be the same track with the same exact screaming over and over again. Hard to enjoy and like."
5,Great compliation,"If you like stuff like Nine Inch Nails and want to broaden your horizons, this is the collection for you. This is like a goth dance club DJ setlist in a box. Most every song is great. Highly recommended, and once you see what you like in this collection, you can check out those artists more."
2,Too boring for words,I couldn't get through the series because I found myself uninspired by the character. She lacked the drive of V.C. Andrews previous heroines. Her father lies about her real mother so of course she goes to find out about her blah blah blah. I mean her blandness reeks on every page.I really don't recommend this book to any...it's sad to say since VC Andrews is my favorite author and i find her books very entertaining. I like reading things that don't necessarily stick to what people deem normal.Willow was just too normal...I couldn't get past book two.
2,dont believe what they say - ...,"i expected so much from this book because of all the praise people gave it. so i bought it with great high hopes and then... they fell. willow grew up in a huge house with gardeners and a full time nanny. she thought she had a hard life?? why did she have to leave school? all the vc heroines think of is family. they need to grow up. i hate the way theyre all beautiful, all talented, all ""bad liars"" and hate doing anything ""bad"". they all have belived mommies and daddies and hate to disappoint them. read the first to series of vc books, but dont go looking in the others for pleasure unless you like to hear people whine about their hard lives."
2,Disappointing,"After the lackluster Hudson series, I, as a longtime VCA fan, was excited to pick up this book when it was released on the shelves nearly ten years ago. but I was disappointed. Neiderman obviously wasn't trying as much as he had been before, and everyone was flat. The story was only mildly interesting, and there was none of the thrills and chills that came with reading a real VCA book, or one of Mr. Neiderman's earlier ghostwriter books (Cutler, Landry)And I'm not sure why Mr. Neiderman couldn't have chosen a better family name, instead of the name of a jewelry business."
2,Highly dissapointed with the eintire series.,"I was very disappointed with this series. It's not written in the same style as all the other VC Andrews books. I have never been so disappointed with the lead female in a V.C Andrews series before. Also, her story was dull, and many of the characters seem flat and two dimensional. I was bored with it. I also jumped the gun and bought the entire book series, without reading it, so I'm really kicking myself. *Sigh.* oh well, life goes on! P.S, If you want a way better VC Andrews story and character, read the Logan series instead. You won't regret it."
4,"Finnally, the heroine without a cardboard brain!","Willow was suprisingly good. I was expecting another skim session after reading such books as Into the Garden and The Falling stars series. I sat down to get the job done as quickly and painlessly as possible and instead found myself [drawn] into the story. I was bowled over, tottally suprised as Willow blasted funny, cutting retorts at her relatives and her thinking was smart, tottally different from the oblivious Dawn, etc. Great book!"
4,"It is a wonderful book, but compared to previous VCA books..","it's mildly supreb. I read some of the other reviews, one person stating it was a sham because Willow lived a fine life with a nanny. True she was, but not all rich people live glorious lives. The new writer for the V.C. Andrews books has worked hard on creating a new series and I think she will grab the V.C. Andrews audience. Willow grows up with a nanny, a horrible adoptive mom, and a adoptive father who is a highly respected man in the psychitiary field. The nanny is more of a mother than her adoptive mother. Her father ends up passing away and Willow runs off to Florida to seek the truth about her past she was never told.The ending is fabulous and I can't wait to read the next book. I have it being sent here as I write, plus the send book also. Anyway, if you are a V.C. Andrews fan, I suggest you read it. It is good."
2,What's the big deal?,"Willow was not that good. I admit, it was better than that horrible Logan series, and the disappointing Hudson series. And those mini series...! But Willow was not that much different. It was so obvious. I mean, come on, you could only predict the whole book in the first three chapters!! Willow was a pretty good herione, although I prefer Heaven, and I liked the way she was strong. A pretty disapppointing book, though, comsidering all the great reviews it got. I expected it to be a lot better. Want a good V.C. series? Try the Heaven series. The new ones are recycled plots with the same old, same old blah."
4,A change for the better,"This book is about Willow, a college girl who finds out many secrets after her father passes away and she goes to look for her real mother in Palm Beach.This book is a change for the better since they started coming out with those wretched mini novels."
5,I love this book,this book was so exciting! I felt so sorry for willows mom! she sounded so sweat! In my opinion this book as awesome and something Im sure the original VC andrews would have come up with!!
1,Lame DVD,"This video is not worth the money. The title is misleading. It shows various skin conditions--not how to analysis the skin for a facial. Also, their way of showing you how to extract is a quick few punches with a comedone extractor--not by hand."
3,Pretty good advertisment for their website,"This magazine is pretty good, some helpful tips, but what I feel the magazine is, is just an advertisment for their website ... like it seems to start a story and then tell you you can find more information at their website. I think for the price it's got enough content to make it worth it, that's just been my observation thus far."
1,I'll pass,"This magazine clearly caters exclusively to the mainstream American parent. As a mother who breastfeeds, cloth diapers, and co-sleeps I find that this publication has very little to offer parents who parent 'outside of the box'. Furthermore, I often come across opinions presented as facts, and studies are often grossly misquoted and misinterpreted. Coming from a scientific background, I find the information presented in this magazine to be skewed and biased and showing a distinct lack of research to back up its claims.I also miss articles on breastfeeding, choices in diapering, etc. The focus is clearly on consumerism (baby products and ads), and there is hardly any critical reflection and not enough information.I'll pass on this one."
3,Kind of fluffy,I liked this magazine more when I was pregnant and was dreaming about mommyhood. Now that I am a mom and have been reading it for a year I feel like the articles are repeating themselves and are quite superficial. I get more insights now out of the parenting books and articles about children in our local paper (Boston Globe).
5,"If you have a child, this is the mag for you!","Parents breaks out articles and product reviews by different age groups so it grows with you and your child. Great ideas for both family and individuals, including timely articles on the benefits/disadvantages of immunizations, sleep, schedules, meals, birthday party ideas by age, best toys, best products (car seats, strollers), etc. One of my favorite sections has different parents comparing products and writing candid reviews about these products. I highly recommend Parents magazines for both pregnant women as well as parents (new and experienced)."
2,OK but a bit consumerist,"I found this magazine to be OK but nothing really worth paying for. Flipping through this magazine I felt like they were trying to sell me every baby product under the sun rather than trying to show me how to best bring up my child.I was surprised to see no mention of breastfeeding in the whole magazine, but I guess there's not a lot of money to be made in breastfeeding products; And the 'must have' baby products would set most new parents back half a years salary. Their information was in many cases common sense and in other cases a bit misleading.From what I have seen I think this may be the best parenting magazine out there, but I would recommend any new mums to save their cash and use the internet instead, you will find both sides of the story there, not just the one which is trying to make money off you."
3,Good but...,"The magazine itself is good, a lot to read but always in the same ""tune"" that all children magazines are. I guess as editors for magazines about kids and pregnant women they run out of themes pretty fast (!!) and also I wonder why is it that the magazine insists (no ofense here to anybody) on having very, very white kids with light eyes on the cover... A only pink rainbow would not be as much fun as the full color one, would it?"
5,Parents is a good magazine!,I really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it!Every parent should read this magazine! Really good activites and advice.
1,NEVER SHOWED UP,"Ordered this 8 months ago, never received an issue. This is the second subscription I got through Amazon that didn't get to me."
1,Never showed up,"I subscribed this magazine on July 2007. After more 6 months passed, none issue showed up. And Amazone did not response to my info request at all.Don't subscribe this magazine through Amazon!!!!! Terrible experience."
5,ONE OF THE BEST OUT THERE!,"I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING PARENTS FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. EVERY MONTH I LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE NEW EDITION OF PARENTS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF USEFUL TIPS AND THE EMERGENCY GUIDES ARE VERY INFORMATIVE. I ALSO LOVE THE YEARLY INFO ON EVERYDAY TOPICS FOR EACH AGE GROUP. OKAY I DO FIND A LOT OF ADDS BUT I HAVE SEEN WORSE. I SUSCRIBE TO CHILD,PARENT, PARENTING, & BABY TALK. BABY TALK AND PARENT ARE SOME OF THE BEST OUT THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Great Magazine But Poor Business Practices,"As an owner of a day care center/director educator, I did recommended Parents magazine - but no longer - I have cancelled. With 5 months remaining on my 2004 subscription, I began to receive collection letters with a increasing threatening tone (""protect your credit,etc."") for subscription extension to 2006. My letters to a PO Box (no telephone # is listed)on their ""invoice letters"" produced no action. You don't want this hassle.It is unfortunate that attempts to force renewal is destroying the reputation of a top notch magazine.Charlotte JohnsonAllen, Texas"
1,Horrible Purchase,"We've placed the order in September and been getting random magazine(s) all the time: Parenting school years, old issue of Parenting Early Years, and one month the magazine never showed. I wouldn't recommend anyone to order this magazine. The bright side of the story is that an Amazon CSR - Heather - was able to give us our full refund :)"
4,Informative and enjoyable,"I've been getting this magazine for about 3 years now, and really enjoy it. There are always articles that apply to my son. The crafts are interesting, and I LOVE their toy recommendations!! I also really enjoy their GoodyBlog online. It's basically the magazine that is updated daily! I recommend this to all my new mommy friends when they are expecting."
1,poor customer service,"Thumbs down for this magazine. I always had missing issues, have contacted customer service about it and nothing is done. I do subscribe to multiple magazines but never had this problem with other publishers. Articles are mediocre at best. I would never recommend this to my friends. There are free baby/ parenting magazines out there which are very similar. Do yourself a favor and do not subscribe!"
4,Wealth of Information,Subscribed because it was so cheap and thought maybe we could find some information raising our five year old. Surprised that it has so much great information. And for this price? Would recommend it to all parents.
2,"What about all of us ""Older Moms""?!~~~","This could be a WONDERFUL parenting magazine, if only they didn't leave out the fastest-growing demographic group of moms...those 35 and over! Also, there's too much emphasis on big families, ""sibling rivalry"", etc. Not much interest to us 43 year old working moms of ONLY children. (My son is two)....By the way, my husband agrees!Get with the times, PARENTS!"
2,Waste of time,"For the amount of advertising and articles written by advertisers, they should be giving this away. We found Wondertime to be a better (but still flawed) child magazine."
3,bottle holder,"These are cute and will fit a small bottle. I bought them for my cousin's daughter who is pregnant. Here in Texas it gets pretty hot in the summer and I am hoping this will help cool the bottles a little longer. I don't think this material will keep anything cool very long, but maybe a little longer than without it. The little bear is cute, but he does not hold on as a handle the way you see in the picture. It is just a thin strip of Velcro - so the bear comes off anytime you touch it."
5,Hercules Returns - a blast from the past,"Caught this movie many times on cable when I was back home in NZ ... a decade or more ago. Been looking for it ever since. Great down-under humor, great scripting. Watched it with friends here in the States and the comment that stood out was: ""We're buying this as well!"""
2,A bargain? You are kidding!,Way too expensive for what it is. You can get it for less than half the price elsewhere.
4,Check that one out after you buy the new one!,"Hard Response are veterans of the east coast scene. Recently reformed in 2005-2006, they have been inactive for almost a decade and they now return with an politically-charged record that is explosive, pissed off and full of hate.Single Bullet Theory is their first full-length. It is different from their 91 demo songs and new album, because it is more melodic and rock influenced. If you apprecite the new album, you should check SBT to learn the roots of Hard Response's melodic touch. Hostile Environment's hidden track is a re-recording of His Shame, taken from SBT. If you appreciate the melodic tone of the hidden track, you will like Single Bullet Theory. The album has a few of rock-influenced smooth & heavy songs that ""take a while to start"" and may test the patience of the average short-attention-span hardcore fan, but remember this was written in the mid-nineties. Great record."
3,Scrumptious!,"A grumpy pirate-like Ogre terrorizes a peasant village shutting down shops, markets and even schools because of his appetite for children. Zeralda, the daughter of a poor working man loves to cook. She cooks such great dishes that when her father falls ill and she is forced to go to market in his place she is able to save the day. Rescuing the hungry Ogre from his own clumsiness and his irrational appetite, Zeralda gives him tastes he never forgets. Soon all the Ogres want what's in Zeralda's kitchen. None want it as much as Zeralda's Ogre though. In a surprise and twisted ending, she marries him. If Disney can pull it off with Shrek, then author Tomi Ungerer should get accolades for her work too. I read this story to a large group of preschoolers and they really enjoyed it."
4,entertaining summer time drama,"Very enjoyable movie about two grown sons (one gay, the otherstraight) who are spending their summer with their eccentric mother(played by the wonderful Lee Grant). The story centers around a romantic fling the gay son has, and Lee Grant's character fearing that she has breast cancer. I love that this whole movie has such a summertime feeling. This movie is A MUST for fans of Lee Grant (who also played the mother of a gay man dying of AIDS in ""It's My Party""). My only complaint is that the actor playing the gay son is a little too queeny."
2,IRONICALLY BACKWARDS,"This book has facts. Lots and lots of facts. But there's one peculiar thing about this book: instead of looking up trivia by category or genre it has the answer first. Kinda like Jeopardy. For instance, you'll look up 'Zot!' first and *then* you'll get the explanation: 'Sound of a thunderbolt in Johnny Hart's comic strip B.C.' As opposed to looking under B.C or JOHNNY HART, or THUNDERBOLT, etc. So, in other words you have to know the answer *before* you get the ""question"". So you can't look up entries by *subject* or *category*. There's no SPORTS, MUSIC, LITERATURE, ART, HISTORY, etc., at least by way of looking up. So unless you're a ""trivia freak"" or just an avid book collector I'd suggest NOT getting this book."
3,A good reference book.,I want to say that I received personal attention from the sellers of this book. They sent a note asking if the book arrived in time and was it in the condition as described. Yes it did arrive on time and the book is in good condition. I would buy from this seller again with confidence and I recommend them to others.
4,seems to work,"I used this product only 3-4 times, so I can't make a bona fide comment, but so far it seems to be working."
5,Softens the harsh shadows.,This diffuser does a nice job softening the flash so you don't have the harsh shadows. If you aren't using a studio this is easy to carry and use.
3,At least it didn't cost much,"I dont't really like this product - it works ok, and I gave it three stars because not everyone has an external flash.My advice though would be to save for a proper flash and get a little diffuser to fit over that."
2,ITS BETTER THAN NOTHING,"Let me start out by saying, I hate flash photography. The flash creates spots of light, harsh shadows, and makes a picture look ""cheap"". IMO. A defuser can soften the colors, even out the light, and bring out more details in a more naturally. Unfortunately this defuser does not really accomplish that significantly. But it is better than not having a defuser at all. Go look at my youtube video under GlockNinja channel. I did an unboxing video and a demonstration. Go to [...][...] <-----go see the video on this product."
5,Worked Great,"I bought this as a Christmas present for a friend. We played with it a lot and it works great. He is using a newer Nikon. I have a first gen Canon and got to try it out. Worked great. Easy to use, put on and take off. I will most likey purchase one for my camera too."
1,Disappointed,"I saw all the 5 star reviews for this product and the sample images people had posted, one from my same camera (Nikon D40) and decided to give it a try. Another reviewer had suggested taping a curved business card to the camera to deflect the flash to the ceiling, and was mocked by a different reviewer for doing so. I tried the business card trick until my Lumiquest Diffuser arrived. Sure, I had to bump up the flash a little and could only hold my camera one way, but I must say it worked far better than the results I got when the Lumiquest finally arrived. What a piece of junk! It's hard to see how anyone could get it to stay in position and even holding it while taking pictures I didn't get much better results than the naked flash. There has to be something better out there."
1,"Bleck. Save your money, get something else","I ordered a Lightscoop and this Lumiquest soft screen. I am not pleased with this soft screen, it does not diffuse like I expected it to. I might as well have put a piece of wax paper in front of my flash. Of course, at this price point, you cannot expect miracles. However, in order to get it to work on my camera, I would have to secure velcro TO YOUR CAMERA. Uhh, no. I did test it as best as I could, but even holding it with my left hand as it was supposed to be attached to the camera.The flash was barely diffused. Again, for 11 bucks, I am not sure what I was expecting.That said, I would seriously save a couple extra bucks and get a Lightscoop. The difference is unbelievable. I have a friend with a hotshoe flash and my indoor results were comparable to hers."
3,Makes very little difference,"This product is affordable, portable and easy to use but it does very little. The tones are warmed a bit, but the shadows remain quite harsh. I get a better result by placing a sheet of rigid translucent plastic in front of the flash. Also, the front attachment loop tends to pop off on my Canon 30D."
4,Does what it's supposed to do...,"This device does what it's supposed to do: diffuse the flash output coming from the built-in flash. The biggest difference can be seen in indoor shots where a straight flash produces harsh shadows; this will soften it a little. Personally, I'm not a big fan of indoor flash photography, but I am now prone to use my flash more because of this. This isn't meant for the enthusiast or professional photographer; it offers no flexibility. For that, you will need an external flash and a dome diffuser."
4,LumiQuest - Soft Screen Flash Diffuser,Great product. Easy to put on and it takes away the hot spots while using the build-in flash on SLR camera's
5,EXCELLENT FLASH DIFFUSER,"I purchased this item and when received, tried it out. In comparison to standard flash, by using it, it softened my subject matter nicely. It is a fine product and works well for what it is intended to do."
1,Canon 7D hot shoe,"Well, I ordered this after reading all the reviews. It came today and I read the directions and trimmed the left side (with the black up) and I still cannot get the flash to fire at all. I've trimmed tiny little pieces at a time and tried each time after the trim. Sometimes I can get it to fire if I push to the left or right in the hot shoe, but most times it won't fire. What a waste of $$$. I wish I had put this $ in the red kettle at Wal-Mart instead. I ordered the Gary Fong Puffer Pop Up Flash Diffuser - CANON/NIKON and it'll be here on Monday. I sure hope it'll do what I need. I just don't want to always take my Speedlight."
4,Good to have on hand.,"Really handy, not a good as a real flash with a diffuser but this is in my bag all the time just in case. Worth the money."
3,Does what it says for Canon XTi.,"This product does as advertised, diffuses and softens the pop up flash built in to prosumer grade DSLRs. It is not a replacement for a full flash system, and does not turn the pop up flash into something else, but does make it a bit more useable than without it. Yes, it does reduce some of the flash's range and brightness, but if you're using a pop up flash, you're not getting a lot of range and brightness in the first place.For what it does, it works, and anytime I use my pop up flash, I use this diffuser."
2,Not very impressed with this item,"I am a natural-light photographer, but there are times when a little flash is definitely helpful. I purchased this soft screen and was not very impressed with it. I haven't used it very much at all, and when I have used it I haven't noticed a great difference between having it on or just going with the naked flash. Price-wise I don't feel I was out too much money, though. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
3,Mixed Results,"1) The tab is too big to get in my camera's hot shoe without folding and stuffing it in, or cutting it.2) Apparently my camera (Cannon powershot pro) disables the built-in flash when something's in the hot shoe - using a pressure switch, so inserting this all the way disables my camera's flash3) Results are mixed. I didn't get underexposures, but some times didn't seem like it did much diffusing.Your mileage may vary, but for $10 it might be worth a try."
5,Works Great!,"I was skeptical about this thing because it looks so... cheap. and it is, but it works GREAT. Now I don't like shooting in dark rooms, it's just not my thing, but when my family gathers it seems I'm always taking pictures in dark places and end up disliking the options of using the flash or slow shutter speeds ( not to mention annoying people with a bright flash) this has changed the quality of my family photos for the better, much better.It's so inexpensive that if you don't like it, well no great loss, but I haven't found anyone who doesn't like shooting with it."
3,Not compatible with Minolta/Sony Dslr,"I checked everywhere on the manufacturer's website to ensure compatibility with my Minolta/Sony camera because i had returned a Gary Fong's puffer when the hot shoe didn't fit. I couldn't find any where that specifically said this product wouldn't fit my KM 7D so I took a leap of faith and bought it. It turned out this item still required to be fitted on the hot shoe and it is not designed for the use with KM/Sony cameras. If the manufacturer had been more conscious of the diversity of users out there and provided clearer information via website or literature, then I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of buying and returning."
1,Very Disappointing,"Save your money. The light diffusion when this is used on a Nikon D-90 is minimal. The screen does not easily curve like it is shown in the photo. The small tab that inserts into the hot shoe tends to straighten out and does not hold the angle required to get a curve in the diffuser. Because of this, the screen lies almost flat against the flash. As a result there is very little diffusion of the light. So - this will go into my drawer of never-to-be-used-again photo gadgets. You'll be better off with a Fong Puffer or similar light modifier."
1,Not good for all DSLRs,"I bought this item as it came recommended in a book. I was thrilled to get it as it says it's compatible with all DSLRs. It seems as it might be more geared for Nikons and Canons -particularly when Canon is specifically mentioned in the small insert that are the instructions. I could not get it to work with the Alpha 200 as the manuafacturer suggested trimming to get it to fit. While they did respond to my inquiry, the instructions were very vague and I never got it to work. Very disappointed, but it may be a nice option for a Canon or a Nikon, which are two of the most popular cameras."
2,not good,"Having used this product a short while,I find it almost useless!!!! I see no difference in my photos with or without it. At least it didn't cost much."
5,excellent guidance!,"I think that the topics reviewed here should be included as part of the spiritual education for all the people, no matter what religion they practice. This information can help every one to avoid problems and to make better decisions, instead of learning from mistakes"
2,Pathfinder,"The band drives me nuts and as many times as I have attempted to set the barometer and altimeter, the altimeter always seems to be way off. Almost daily it seems to show a different altitude for the same area. I could be operator error and if that is the case, it is not user friendly then.... As far as the band goes, it come unbuckled and falls off of my wrist regularly."
4,drab green color,"When I ordered the watch , the picture was practically black and white, and there was no mention of the drab green colored band. I was expecting a black or gray band. I looks fine, is good for treking out into the woods, but you might not want to wear it as often because of the color. I have not yet learned all of the features of the watch , but it seems to be easy, though not intuitive. You'll have to read the instructions."
4,service was excellent,the service was excellent the watch is good but the instruction and everything is kinda hard to undertand but overall product is excellent i just need time to calibrate and understand the guide book
5,5-Stars,"I bought this for my husband to use in Afghanistan. It is has everything he needs, plus it doesn't have any metal so it doesn't reflect light."
2,Just plain awful...!,"Those familiar with Norman Cook know his genius. Unfortuantely, it doesn't show in ""Halfway..."" It's a congested piece of oversampled beats and dysfunctional melodies holding abosolutely no catchy tune whatsoever. Instead, Cook relies on the old ""Guest Singer"" route (Macy Gray and Bootsy Collins being amongst those) to singing away to off-beats and congested melodies.Hopefully, FBS will have a better offering next time around. This one is one to avoid."
2,Ambitious but Disappointing,"Fatboy Slim set his own bar too high with ""you've come a long way, baby"". The only way for Norman to evolve and escape the high expectations set by his former work is to evolve into a new direction. He chooses to literally spoil his own style by collaborating with Macy Gray and Bootsy Collins. Whether the already mentioned collaborations are fine is questionable. The fact that they are not techno at all, is however, not! The rest of the album also aims to sound original and makes a large step back from the quality of ""you've come..."". Although this album has an enormous commercial success, it is much much worse than Fatboy's last work."
1,This Ain't Gospel...,"If you like New Orleans Jazz, Gospel and soul and you buy CDs at Amazon.com, you may find this album as a recommendation. Don't get me wrong, I generally love Amazon's suggestions, but this is hip-hop house music with only the slightest hint of the influences of Gospel. Long, repetitious chants of ""What the f**k"" can make for a great song but just not what I was expecting. Yeah, Fat Boy Slim has evolved, but not very much."
1,Disappointing,This album is pure hip-hop and unlike anything he made before. It is a waste of money.
2,The Fatboy Skank,"It's not bad, per se--just not *there*. Fatboy has the big beat thing with thick layered sounds, but the funk thing isn't working for me. A little might have, but it just screeches on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on... It ends up being annoying instead of fun. It comes off as experimental, as it's said to be--but then I already have plenty of used CD-drink coasters from other experiments gone bad. To be fair, this isn't exactly a frisbee, but it's definately not on the A-list and probably not even the C-list. If Fatboy keeps this going, I'll be takin' a pass on his next collection of skank."
3,Explicit Lyrics,"Yes, quite. Good songs though. But if you're looking for something to play at the office, get the ""clean"" version.I can't believe I think like that now! Where's my F.O.A.D t-shirt....."
2,Not a fatboy-like album,"I don't know what happened to him, but this CD is a disappointment compared to On The Floor at the Boutique, the Essential Mix, and even the Norman Cooke collection. The album is not interesting and lacks the humor that his previous albums have."
2,Following the Chemical Brothers...?,"When I think of Fatboy Slim I think layered instrumental beats that create atmosphere, not Macy Gray. Stacking vocals onto what would have otherwise resulted in perfection seems like such a waste. The tracks don't suit eachother at all. There is no melding between songs which has made all of the other Slim albums so good. The vocals distract from the MUSIC which is what it SHOULD be all about. I would have had no problem with this album if he would have left out all of the singing. It is annoying, just like the Chemical Brothers ""Surrender"". So, if you're looking for a good techno/dance/mix album look elsewhere. Don't waste your money."
2,What's New?,"Another album from our dear Mr Zoe Ball, wow, it has Bootsy Collins and our hottest neo-soul diva Macy Gray featured on it, yeah, it is different from the last album, but still, Fatboy Slim is forever Fatboy Slim, he is neither the creater of Big Beat music nor is he one of the most innovative. This might be a much better album than his awful 'You've come a long way', still, I smell much cheese in it. Come on, he can't even beat Chemical Brothers in terms of sonic experimentation, you expect him to experiment?? It is one of those insipid HUGE dance albums of the year, together with Roni Size's 'In The Mode' and Moby's 'Play: The B-Sides', all of those albums have GREAT marketing strategy and most dreary music. I rather stick to my Photek and Amon Tobin, sorry! Heard that he is not going to make music again, if it is not a stunt for Mr Ball to sell more copies of that trash, then I will say: Horray!!!Hey, Mr Ball, the exit is there!"
5,This is a great record old norman put out..............!,"I have been following fatboy a very long time now....The album is great....It has macy gray, to roland clark......If you love house music, and like the big beat style....this is definitely one to buy.......This is also very much fun to mix....I'm also a dj, and love to mix all of fatboy slims records......I have 2 words for everyone.............""purchase this"""
5,smooth,This album is so smooth. Great follow up. The tunes with Macy Gray are possibly the best on the album.
2,Closer to the Gutter than the Stars,"I was hotdog jumping from foot to foot waiting for this album to come out. Fatboy has got to be one of the most uplifting DJs of recent times, combined with the toe curling melodious rasp from Macy Gray...how could it miss? But it did...and by a mile. I am pleased to see that there are some positive reviews here, but not from this cat noooooooooo...."
3,Nothing Special,"This album is good, but it sure isn't great like his other two were. One or two songs get going pretty good, but none of them send you on any kind of ecstatic musical journey. Fatboy has slowed down quite a bit. He tries to send you up floating on clouds instead of shooting you up in a cannon, and he doesn't quite make it. Gone is most of the original and unique genius heard on previous albums. Moby's influence is strongly heard on much of the album, to the point of silliness. I hate to say it, but it sounds like Fat Boy Slim has... gotten old."
2,Really dissapointed,"This is the worst album I've heard yet by Fatboy Slim. It seems he's lost touch with what makes really good dance and big-beat music. The only decent tracks are Ya Mama and Drop the Hate are the only two songs which can compare to his previous releases. It seems that the success of Praise You from his last album, and Moby's play have made him completely change to a softer, less hard-core form of music. I have been a loyal Fatboy Slim fan since his first album came out, I bought his second album opening day, as I did this one, but I thought this album was weak."
4,Halfway to the toilet,"Upon listening to this CD, you'll be Halfway to... disgust. You'll probably be dissapointed that this CD is so different than his other stuff. But,keep listening you'll then find that it's an enjoyable CD, and worthy to own if you're looking for something a little different in the tecnho genre."
2,Instant Used CD Bin Fodder,"Fatboy goes lame on this album. His desired style shift might be a personal preferance, but it's not listenable like his last two efforts. There's the exception...mainly track 8--Drop the Hate. Burn that song to an MP3 and sell it used, use it as a frisbee, or a coaster. Very disappointing."
3,"Alright, But Not Classic Fatboy","This CD is okay, but doesn't match up to the rest of Fatboy Slim's Work. The CD Gets Annoying if you try to listen to it too much, but my main gripe is the vocals. If this CD was instrumental, it would instantly make my top 5. He was trying to become too mainstream with Macy Gray and All. This had the potential to be genuis, and if it came out in instrumental, It would be. Do youself a favor and get On The Floor At The Boutique by Fatboy. It's a better choice for Slim."
3,It's okay,Not as good as some of his other stuff - seems less inspired for some reason. On the floor at the Boutique is much better.
2,fatboy dim,"it seems that norman cook has found a sound and is sticking to it since this album differs very little from his previous release ""you've come a long way, baby."" a vocal sample here, some bigbeat drums there and a little synth on the side. the more fatboy you hear, the more apparent his process becomes.the components within each track try to converge and come off as a song, but they don't. instead it's a bunch of quantized segments assembling a structural unit of sound.in other words: rather than recognizing the spaceship, all you see are the lego pieces that it's built out of."
2,"Is this supposed to be his ""Sargent Pepper"" album?","Number 5 is ok. The rest of this thing pretty much [smells]. The man has gone ""artistic"" on us and gave up a good thing. Buy his earlier work and skip this one."
4,Lotsa fun!,"I bought this CD just for ""Weapon of Choice"" and was pleased to find that I like the whole album."
2,Porn,"It s basically 75% porn and 25% story. Really not a romance story. If you are into graphic written porn and multiple couples, then this is for u."
1,Poorly made,"Do not buy this product. I ordered it before reading the reviews and am sad to report that mine was also defective. The ipod plug is poorly made, and would not maintain a clean connection. I wish they would make it more durable, it was the best solution I had found so far for my Alpine with Ai-Net."
1,Would be good if it didn't short out almost immediately,"Would be good if it worked longer than a few months of light use. Connector is poorly made snap-together with minimal stress relief, even gingerly used, the power leads short out and product fails."
2,no that good,has a bad connection. first thought it was MY iPod but then tried others and it just wont stay connected well.
2,Guess we'll see,"For the money I paid for these paper replicas, they had better work.I was sorely disappointed when I opened the shipping box and saw a package with 2 plastic clips, 2 metal rods and essentially a folded up paper photograph on cardboard with no instructions. It was like having my own little logic puzzle - after about 3-4 minutes I figured it out, but paper intructions might have helped.For $39.95, I might have been able to make these myself. Hope they at least work."
4,Great,I enjoyed the first season. I missed it and decided to purchase the download on my iPad. Can't wait to download the second season.
1,Do not even bother,I thought this would be like the Real Housewives but was i wrong this was just trash that belongs in the trash Do Not Waist your money on thisEpisode 1
5,Superb,"Emmanuel Krivine's series of Mozart symphony recordings on Denon ranks with the finest ever recorded. The current CD is no exception. The playing, especially the strings, is just exceptional. No. 25 receives a deep sounding, multi-layered rendition. The acoustic, recorded in a church, is full and sonorous, with a convincing depth to the orchestral body. There is no attempt to place extra musical meaning onto this work through oversharp accents and ponderous tempi. Symphony No. 40, the other of Mozart's G Minor symphonies, was recorded in Henry Wood Hall and receives a more forward sounding recording. It's amazing how much can be achieved in this work though attention to balances and intonation. For simply beautiful orchestral sound, this reading would be hard to surpass. Once again, Krivine's tempos are moderate and sensible, letting the music make its points without any excessive punctuation. This is Mozart in the same league as Bohm and Walter."
5,Good advice,"I got my total cholesterol down from 275 to 191, Triglycerides down from 221 to 96. LDL down from, 182 to 118 and HDL up from 49 to 54.This was accomplished in 10 weeks by rigidly sticking to the zero saturated fat recommendation and half heartedly trying the Niacin regimen.I cut out cheese, milk, whole eggs, etc. and substituted with olive and canola oils.I have since ramped up the niacin regimen to the complete doses recommended by the book and will see if I can improve on these already impressive numbers.Try it, it works.UPDATE - 10 weeks after the review above I had my lipids checked again and my total cholesterol is now 133; that's pretty amazing considering mytotal was 275 just five months ago and I have not taken any prescription medications. My LDL is now 75 (down from 182) and my triglyserides are now 71 (down from 221). I am actually concerned my cholesterol may now be too low. Great advice!"
4,Perfect for the Newbie,I knew nothing about cholesterol and this was my first and only book. It was all I needed to get started. I followed his recommendations and lowered my cholesterol from 272 to 219 in 5 weeks.
5,Well explained strategy and direction.,After a family member received a bad diagnosis from his doctor we were in the uneviable position of getting his blood pressure and cholesterol down....and fast. We sifted through dozens of books at the library and found this one. It clearly and concisely explains what has to be done (and not done) to reduce cholesterol and get a healthly heart. And it works.
4,8 Weeks of Waiting,"I ordered this book after I was diagnosed with PAD which was a genetic problem for me since I had none of the risk factors. My total cholesterol was 127 so I was of two minds about ordering this book when it was cited during my research for non-medical alternatives. However, since I was ready to try anything, and since it had good ratings I ordered it. It arrived over a month later than promised and by then I had found an alternative source. The book was purchased used and is in good condition. I plan to read it someday. It wasn't worth returning it so it's now part of my library collection."
3,There Is No Cure,"After reading this book, I have come to a simple conclusion: You can't beat the effectiveness of statin drugs.The author basically instructs the reader to eat right, exercise and take high doses of Vitamins E, C, and a few other vitamins along with Omega-3 oils, and strict doses of Niacin. Now that's all well and good, but if I were to follow the authors advice on dosage of the aforementioned vitamins and oils, then it would end up costing me significantly more, way more than my $10/month co-pay for Zocor. Plus, like I mentioned, there's no amount of vitamins that can beat a statin drug's effectiveness at lowering cholesterol.So while the book has some useful advice, keep in mind there is no ""cure"" and you really won't see significant lowering of LDL or total cholesterol levels using this book. Talk to your doctor about a statin drug."
3,Great family tent...poor quality control,"The tent itself is really great, lots of room, fairly simple to take up and down. Ours did come with a cosmetic flaw though, as the red fabric seems to have bled onto the lighter part of the tent. Now one whole top side looks almost tie-died? Hopefully the rain fly will cover most of the area, and like I said, it's only a cosmetic issue. The tent functionality and overall quality seems to be great."
2,Keep away from this tent,We used the tent once. Found setting up to be a chore. You want two adults for the task. My son entered the tent without fully un-zippering along the bottom of the door. He tripped over the un-zipped section of the door and tore the door apart. The fabic just gave up! I can't recommend the tent to anyone.
2,GOOD,"We have used the product only once and during the set-up a slight tear was evident @ one of the base connectors. Apart from that, the tent layout is great and we experienced torrential rain during the second night of our 3 night trip and the tent performed beautifully; our friends across from our tent site wasn't as lucky...they had several leaks."
4,Cougar Flats = Big Comfort,"Hits- Spacious, good ventilation, lots of storage space, sleeps 6 ~ 7 comfortably, carry bag big enough to pack tent easily, remote controlled light was a nice addition and so were the cup holders and pocketsMisses- need 2 hands to open and close zipper otherwise it gets stuck- could use a bigger fly, noticed some dampness after rainfallThe carry bag wheel and zipper broke after my 1st camping trip - call customer support and a replacement is being sent - no hassle, good customer support.Overall commentNice tent! Durability - we'll see after a few more trips"
5,Just Simply a Great Tent,"This cabin dome type tent will sure be the envy of the campsite! Its huge and durable and it even sleeps up to 8 people! You can store your stuff in here and it separates into two separate rooms so changing isn't difficult! Its venting system will provide fresh air throughout the whole cabin day and night, so stuffiness is out of the question. This cabin is comfortable and a great buy. It'll serve you well and it's a great thing to have out in the wilderness! It wont let you down! I recommend this to all of you nature lovers and campers out there!"
2,"Nice Design, Poor Quality","First of all, I was impressed by the size of the tent. Also, the design was unique. It was fairly easy to assemble, even by myself. As others have stated, the directions are hard to understand. Once I put the tent up, it was apparent that the seams were not sewn well. The zippers are cheap and snag. The rainfly could have been better as well, since there is not enough overhang at the doorways. If you don't do allot of camping and require a large tent, then this is for you. If you are a frequent camper, then I would recommend a higher quality tent."
5,Super roomy tent from a good maker,"In 4 words: Good tent. Buy it.This is a tent ideal for car or canoe camping. I had heard things about gradual UV damage, but I live in Central Florida, and has been out in full sun for about three weeks at together, no signs of fading or cracking at all. It could easily sleep eight people + with room to spare when family camping, and I often take it surf camping (at which time it is set up in on the beach or in scrub habitat, when the UV damage comes into play.)This tent has quality construction as well, at par with Eureka tents. The venting system does it's job well, especially when power is within reach and you supplement it with a fan in one of the bay windows. The seams also came sealed, and sealed well, and right. They were actually over sealed. I've never ever had this with a tent. I've stayed totally dry through completely insane storms. I trust it to be as dry as my backpacking tent."
5,Good weekend camping tent,"I'm a weekend camper. I was in the market for a family dome tent. Did some research and bought the ""cougar flats"". I also purchased an under floor protector tarp. The first setup took some extra time, mostly because my prior tent was a really old small canvas style. I can set this tent up by myself in 10 minutes now. On the last night of camping we had high winds and 4"" of rain in 6 hrs. We did have a couple of small rain leaks down at a lower seam that were of no significance to us. Surprisingly we were able to keep the cross flow circulation widows open during the rain! The tent stood up to the wind no problem. We really like the build quality and room this tent has to offer and love camping even more now. It comes with a few extras including a carrying case. Its not a back packing style of tent."
5,Awsome!,"Me and my friends love to campout. But my tent only fits 2 people, so i want to get a bigger one. I saw this tent and i thought it was great."
2,Best Tent Ever?,"Golly Gee Goober, I've owned enough tents to know this sure aint the best tent ever! Its ok, thats it. Quality is questionable. My $.02"
4,Great tent in driving rain!,"We recently purchased this tent for our family of five. The tent had plenty of room for us, two queen sized air mattresses, two single air mattresses, duffel bags, and one medium sized dog. As with all tents, the set up instructions were a little sparse, but after setting it up once at home we set it up at the camp site in under 20 minutes. We had 30-40 mile an hour winds, 39 degree temps and driving rain on our 2nd night of camping. We were snug as bugs inside. The tent totally blocked the winds. Our door zipper on the rain side leaked a bit where water pooled at the bottom corner of the zipper, but the rain fly kept every thing else high and dry while our friends' Magellan tent leaked like a sieve. Overall we love this tent!"
4,real good tent,I have had this tent for a month now and it is in my back yard. it has been dry in the rain and is very roomy easy to set up and great ventalation. this tent is going to be my home in costa rica for 2 months next year and as of now I think it will be perfect for that.
5,The Best Tent Around,"We got this for a camping trip to South Carolina - tons of room. We have 2 oversize cots from Cabella's that we had crossways (the ends protruded through the divider door) but still had room to squeeze through to crawl in. We also had 2 chairs, a port-potty, all of our clothes, etc in the other side and still weren't cramped. The tent held up well during daily rains including 2 very heavy rainfalls/storms. The hanging shelf and cup holders weren't really used and probably won't be, but the gear loft was great for stowing hats. The ""bay"" windows allowed us to get a breeze in all but the heaviest rains, and with the full coverage rainfly we didn't even get a drop of water inside. We are very pleased with this tent and plan on giving a couple of them as Christmas presents this year."
5,Awesome Tent,"Tent could benefit from more detailed instructions, but once up the tent is incredible. Setup and takedown is really easy and the tent is well made and is ready to go! Tent was up in no time, storms came through the night, not a leak, not a drop! Winds gusting, no problem. Tent will comfortable sleep 6-8. Two queen size mattresses on each side. Tent is very spacious and incorporates all of the latest features as far as portability, weatherproofing, etc. Great Tent."
5,Cougar Flats Tent,"The cougar flats tent is wonderful. I received it as a birthday present and used it this summer. It is a bit difficult to put up with just one person due to it's large size, but with two it is a breeze. This tent offers great space on the inside and excellent airflow. When we went camping it downpoured for a day and the tent stayed bone dry. It is well constructed. If you are a casual camper or one that goes frequently this tent would be a wonderful investment."
4,"Great tent, but look out for high winds","used this tent for the first time last week! lots of room, pretty easy to set up, was in MOAB Utah rock crawling for a week, tent was great had all my gear neatly in the tent lots of room, woke up to some wind on tuesday morning, checked all the stakes, and tie down lines, and went wheeling, when hours out on the trail the winds really picked up, by the time got back to the KOA, it was late eve, and the tent was trashed rain fly was shredded, tie down lines were riped from the tent, pretty much the rain fly took the bulk of dammage, 2 holes and one broken pole in tent... watch out in high winds bigger the tent the more she wants to go flying! hopefull i can get a new rain fly and a pole, they said got over 50 mph gusts..."
1,not worth the money,This DVD was s disappointment to me. I bought it to help me with my flexibility for jiu-jitsu.The main part of the DVD is just a video of a seminar Jeremy Corbell did. He is not speaking to the camera. He is speaking to the students who are there (Usually with his back to the camera) but the audio of him speaking was too low for me to hear.There is a demo on the DVD of him doing all the positions for the camera outdoors but there is no explanation. he doesn't speak and there is no text explaining how to follow along or what exactly you are trying to do when you are in any of these positions.Maybe this DVD would be good for someone who is more familiar with yoga but I thought it was a complete waste of money.I'll be returning it.
4,Good but detailed,this book wasnt bad but it was extremely long and drawn out. it goes into much uneeded detail but had some good parts to it. maybe worth reading if you are bored.
3,Very real book.,"This is the story of a rugby team whos plane crashes in the Andes Mountains. This book shows how most of the team survived and even got rescued. A couple of the hardships that are faced are an avalanche and running out of food, which makes them resort to cannibalism.The story was a good read, but the genre is not my type. This book did not click with me. Read this book if you want a real and graphic story because that is what it is."
4,ALIVE review,"The book, ""Alive"" is a quality true story book. I gave it 4 stars because it is much longer than it should be. I liked the details the author gives to make the reader feel the emotion and pain that the characters faced. The fact that it is a true story makes the book more interesting to read because you get into it and want to see what they encounter next. It is a good book to read, I recommend reading it."
3,Gets you off your seat,The book alive is a good book that has alot of adventure in it. it keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. the book talks about a rugby team that travels to chile for a tournament and then end up crashing in the Andes mountains. They don't have much to live on so they start having to each other to survive. the book is pretty graphic and it goes into alot of details but i thought it was a pretty good book at times it got into too many details but all in all it was a well written book.
4,Survival Through Cooperation,"The story of the Andes plane crash and rescue has become world famous becuse the survivors ed on the bodies of the dead for over two months until two of them managed tho hike their way out of the mountains to alert rescuers. But what is striking about this story is the amazing amount of mutual cooperation among the survivors, most of whom were in their late teens and early twenties. That they managed for the most part to retain their civilized natures in the wake of utter hopelessness and through working together devised a workable plan to effect their own rescue is nothing short of remarkable. Nearly three decades have passed since the crash, but the compelling nature of this story has not diminihed in the slightest."
5,35 Years Later...and this book STILL haunts me...,"I read this book in high school in 1976 (causing a long waiting list at the library because I read so slowly.)This book is perfect: avoiding melodrama and sensationalism but with the pacing of a great documentary.All of the characters are so distinct and so fully-realized you will get caught up in their individual quirks and behaviors...so much so you will be right there with them when they make a very difficult decision to survive. The subject matter may not be easy to take, but the book is so well written you will agree you would have done the same thing.A one-of-a-kind book that I hope stays in print forever...this is how all non-fiction should be done."
3,A very intense read,Alive is a story about a team of rugby players who crash land there plane in the andes mountians. this book is very graphic and is very intense story I would recomend the book to college freshman or higher grade level because of the graphic nature. I liked this book for a required lit. book. I would not have finished it if it had not been required
3,This book needed an editor!,"This book is about 100 pages too long for my taste. Though the story was very compelling, I felt lost and bored while I was reading through the middle section. I think that a good editor could have helped that situation. One certainly got a sense of the tedium of the young men's lives as they languished on the mountain but the sameness of the details soon became quite tedious to me.In addition, I think a good editor would have made sure that a book of this nature would have included a chart or list of all the victims and survivors. With so many names to keep track of I became very confused who was who, who had died or survived, and when the deaths occurred. As I read the book I searched the book more than once looking for such a help.Admittedly I read a First Edition of the book so, perhaps, later printings included such a chart. If not, it needs one."
5,Awesome,"Bought this book for my husband, it is one of his favorites. He loved it better than the movie. Lisa LL,NM"
4,Very Moving,"Great book, the author does a wonderful job. This book moves along and is never dull. Many times with type of book the big event that start out the book is about the best part of it and the rest of the book kinda dies after it, but not this one. The story keep going and you want to keep reading. I would put this up there with Into Thin Air and above The Perfect Storm. It is much better then the movie."
3,Survivors,"Alive is a very boring book. The plot is way to long, and it takes to long to read. The book really doesn't make sense either.How the survivors live in the Andes is kind of weird, I think. Something that was good about the book is that the author made you feel like you were actually in the mountains with the survivors. Something else that I like about this book is that theywere saved in a really cool way. Another thing that I don't like about this book is that there is a lot of days that this book takes place.So,if you were to buy this book I would sort of recommend this book. Take my advice and don't by this book."
1,SOoooooo boring...,"I read this book with the hopes that it would be great, and i wouldn't be able to put it down. I wanted to read a gripping book, but i was terribly let down. After reading more than half of the book, i knew that they would get rescued, and i would have happily put down the book and never touched it again. The book gave way too many details and therefore it was unthinkably boring. I definately do not suggest reading this book."
1,Save time and watch the movie,"Um...yeah...the movie's better. If you wanna save time, just watch the movie"
2,not gripping,"The main problems I have with this book are the lack of suspense and the poor documentary-like writing style.The book isn't suspenseful becuase you know from the beginning that there will be survivors, the digestive and cannabalistic hardships are predictable, and you cannot attach yourself to the characters and worry about whether they will be survivors. The only genuinely suspenseful part of the book lasts about 7 pages. The characters are consistently one-note in nature, and the interaction between them becomes predictable quickly. A probable reason for this is that the author didn't have enough room to develop the main characters since there are so many of them.I am aware that the book is nonfiction, and my secondary complaint is most likely a symptom of that, although I've read well-written nonfiction before.I'm quite tired right now, and I've probably made several spelling and grammar errors which I'm not the mood to check for."
4,Alive,Alive is an awesome book! It has tons of action and lots of detail. The author does a really good job of describing what is going on. I recomend this book to anybody. The only reason you might not want to read this book is because a main part of it is about cannibalism.
2,This book is small,I was expecting a full size hard cover and got a mini me hard cover book. Paid a hard cover price. Should have went to Barnes and Noble. Will next time.
3,"very good, but to uninteresting a beginning.","Although Piers Paul Reid has tried his best to make this a factual piece of writing, he goes a bit overboard in the beggining, but if you can last it out, its well worth the read."
5,Big Review,"One of the best rock band from the 80's, all of the songs are great and the sound quality is intact and sounds really good too. If you love 80's oldies, this is the best purchase to get."
1,Oceanus Watch fails and parts not available,"Love the watch but it stop performing in less than 2 year. Sent the watch back to Casio to repair. This watch is still under a three year warranty, too! I've been told they can't repair the watch. This watch, the analog and digital, is no long being made...ugh. I spend $400 for a watch that can't be repaired. I've asked for my money back, as of this point no response. I'm very unhappy and I would say away from this brand because if it breaks, it can't get fixed."
3,Lens cap won't stay on.,I didn't realize as stated in the description that there are no threads in the front of this filter. The lens protection cap falls off very easily.
1,It so thin,"It's so thin, that the cap of the lens doesn't have any chance to get hold on. All right it can fit, but at the little touch of everything it goes lose. For the price, I bought other brands and work better. Remember, the cheap you buy, the problems you get, but if you know about it, use it until you can afford to get the right one. For me, this lesson cost a lot."
3,"It's a freaking filter, ok, a wide angle filter to keep the freaking dust off the lens.","Yes, it's a clear piece of glass that blocks UV, and screws on the lens, wow...Specially profiled to minimize vignetting.Why does Amazon bug me for this review??? Dunno..."
1,Lens cap?,The filter itself works and fits great. But my lens cap can't attach to it. It's not deep enough. Very frustrating!!!
2,Lens cap doesn't fit,I wish I would have read the reviews earlier. I didn't know how thin this filter was until I got it and now I have to either store it without a lens cap on or take it on/off each time which isn't ideal either.What a pain. Will likely just get a new filter that I can use my lens cap on.
3,Amazon Messed Up,I purchased the filter thinking I will received a lens to fit it. Amazon messed up my credit card therefore canceling the lens for the filter. So I have a filter and no lens.Thanks Amazon
1,This book is definitely misnamed...,"When a book is titled ""Big Book of Crazy Quilt Stitches"" I indeed expected a BIG BOOK ...not something the thickness of a pamphlet and the contents were just as insubstantial... It went straight to the library as a donation for its book sale... It was a waste of my money.."
2,Amateur recording,"A wonderful score beautifully performed, but recorded to less than home-video standards.Although an early opera, this is, in my opinion, one of Rossini`s finest scores. It has an abundance of melodies rarely encountered anywhere.As can be judged from the very poor recording, the performance was indeed very good.The picture is hazy, all colours fading into a yellowish-brown.The sound begins very badly, and actually gets worse as the opera progresses. I think that such sub-standard recordings should not be encouraged by the public, I`m really sorry I boght it...5 stars for the music and performance, zero for technical quality."
3,Not one of Goldman's better books.,"Although very easy to read, I felt that the book never really grabbed you and pulled you in. Goldman does a good job creating all the characters, but doesn't seem to know what to do with them after that. Certainly shows the dark sides of a bad marriage and its affects on a child. A decent read, but Goldman has done so much better!"
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this subscription for my now 4 year old boy. He loves the idea that he gets a magazine, but as a parent I am disappointed in content. There are very few activities and too many adds for a young childs magazine."
1,Glorified coloring book,"Disclosure: I'm writing this review on the basis of one issue only, but I don't imagine that the magazine is typically any better than this.Turtle magazine is a fairly typical length for preschoolers, 36 pages including the covers. But then this includes ads. And a two page ""Ask Dr. Cory"" feature, clearly aimed at parents. Plus a two page ""Turtle's Favorite Books"" section, which will tantalize your child with pictures from a selected book along with a short blurb, so this is either an ad aimed at your child or a recommendation aimed at parents.Much of the remaining pages are coloring activities, connect-the-dots, and the like. If your child likes these, you'd be better off getting a coloring/activity book from your local dollar store. If you want a higher quality magazine for your child, try Ladybug, Click or Your Big Backyard."
3,For the younger kids,"My son got this magazine for the past year. He is 5 and was hardly interested in it. There was very little in it he could look at on his own, mostly cartoon pictures with few photographs. He enjoys Your Big Back Yard much more."
3,"My child loves it, but it's rather expensive for the length","First, for the review that says something about the ads--what ads? The reason it is so expensive is the lack of ads.It is short, sweet, and has fun activities that my 3-year old enjoys. She especially likes the stories and poems. Sometimes they even have recipes, which are generally somewhat healthy (with fruit, nuts, etc.). The only reason we will not renew is the price."
5,Wonderful preschool magazine,"This is a wonderful magazine for preschoolers! There is a nice balance throughout with activities, a short story, a recipe, a family craft (we always have fun with this), and of course, Turtle's Pet Show. My grandson loves looking at the kids with their pets, and we're going to send his pet photo in soon! There is a funny cartoon in every issue which always has a good moral message. And they have an ongoing art contest where little ones can send in their drawings and compete to be on the cover of the magazine! How special is that!? I would recommend this to anyone with small children. You won't be disappointed."
2,"Tiring, tourtured treatment","This book would have made a good magazine article. It got to a point where I had to struggle between just puting it away and finishing it. While ther are some good ideas here, other than to convince us what a great architect he is by citing his own work over and over, on the whole I found this to be much too exhausting to warrant the time.DK"
4,Good Insights From A Leading Course Designer,"RTJ II's Golf By Design provides a number of insights into the mind of the designer and how they view the elements that go into the design of a golf hole. I found the book to be more descriptive of how designers think and less prescriptive about what the player should do in terms of dealing with the various design elements (Butch Harmon's Playing Lessons is a much more strategic approach to playing individual holes). Many of the leading architects of this day and age have written similar books (Trent Jones Sr., Pete Dye, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Fazio ....) - consider this book RTJ II's contribution to this genre ....."
2,"Good Idea, Didn't Followthrough...","A great idea in that when I play I want to know the visual as well as geograhical hazzards. Some interesting information about what RJones does with his courses, but no real mention of anybody else. I would have liked something to the effect of ""Nicklaus guards the gree with...that forces...type of shot...."" In the end I learned some things, but definitely not $ worth."
1,Disappointing,I expected much more insight on how to approach and manage specific design aspects from this book. This book provided nothing in respect to lowering one's score by Reading the Features of a Course. Save your money and buy a yardage book to the course you're playing. It will provide much more valuable information than this book.
4,Good for both golfers and prospective designers.,"This is a well-written and interesting look at the strategic/penal aspects of the golf course. Robert Trent Jones has certainly designed some of the world's best courses, and is qualified on the subject. This book is a very comprehensive discussion of what goes through a designer's mind when creating the golf course. However, it is probably most useful for the avid golfer who wishes to better understand the design of the courses that she/he plays for course management purposes. Playing golf holes with an understanding of what the designer had in mind should make anyone a better player. When studied carefully, this book can perhaps help a golfer more than most of the instructional books available today.If you are more interested in design books which are not really meant for playing purposes, I recommend ""The Anatomy of a Golf Course,"" by Tom Doak, as well as ""Masters of the Links,"" edited by Geoff Shackelford."
2,Interesting but not exactly comfortable,This product is a neat concept but I found that it doesn't conform as easily as they make it look. In addition I do not find the support it offers to be all the great. It tends to be to bulky for my neck. Also the ends do not have the flexible spine in them like the middle does. So the consistency of the pillow is different depending on where you place your head and neck.
5,Get's Me In The Zone!!!,"Britney sounds fantastic on this new sound. Me Against the Music is a classic urban house hiphop club song kinda thing. All the clubs I've been to play it or some remix of it and people are shaking their butts to it. It sounds great blasting out of my Benz too. The beats on this song are tremendous and though its a little crowded with Madonna and background singers, Me Against The Music is a great club anthem and really shows that Britney does have talent. And hey, its not even one of the best tracks on In The Zone...sop go out and buy the album cause it fits the who;le club thing too!! Madonna is a great addition to this song but again the vocals and production make for a kind of crowded song but hey its Britney and everything she does works! Rock on! LATE!"
5,In The Zone and Me against the Music?,"Both the cd-single and the album are really great, and there are way better tracks on te album and this is one of the best tracks on the album aswell as the video, and to tell you the truth the Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix is better than the original because the beat is better, and the remix is extended (4:29) so get both the cd-single and the album both great!"
4,GET READY...GET INTO THE ZONE!,Britney prepares to take on the dance world and prove she's got what it takes to become this generations' Madonna -- so it makes perfect sense she inlists the help of the pop icon to make her first single from her much anticipated new release IN THE ZONE an anthem for the new millenium! Let me see you dance!
1,Silly and Boring.,"On paper, the concept is pure genius: Madonna, pop tart of the 1980s, teaming up with Britney Spears, pop tart of the new millennium. The collaboration could have been as titillating as the lesploitation kiss they shared at the 2003 VMAs. Instead, we get a generic dance single that's silly, boring, and goes limp faster than Britney's marriage. ""Me Against the Music"" stiffed on the charts upon release, and you can credit that to the forced come-ons and lack of chemistry between the two singers. In fact, the duet sounds so impersonal, Madonna could have very well recorded her vocals on an Mp3 file before FedExing them to Spears. ""Hey Britney,"" goes Madonna, ""you say you wanna lose control?"" Well, if both singers lost a little ""control"" and got a tighter groove, ""Me Against the Music"" would be the killer dance tune it could have--and SHOULD have--been."
5,AMAZING!!,This song is so amazing and so are the remixes - BUY THIS AND THE WHOLE CD!!! Best EVER!! Amazing!
2,Madonna is so much better!!!!!!!,"Madonna and Britney shouldn't even be put in the same senstence; Madge is the Queen of Pop and Britney . . . well . . . she is the Plastic Barbie Doll of Pop. This song is unremarkable. Lyrically, the song is horrendous, and the mildly infectious beat can only redeem it ever so much. Madonna should never have agreed to collaborate with Britney."
3,Britney's Not So In The Zone on This One,"When I first heard that Britney Spears was teaming up with Madonna to do a song, I was thrilled! I couldn't wait to hear them collarobrate. When I first heard MATM I was dissapointed, it wasn't at all what I was expecting. But being the remix junkie that I am I hoped that the remixes of the song would be better, my prayers were answered when I bought this single-the stand-out here is the Mad Brit mixshow. It was so mellow and dance-friendly. The rest of the mixes are ok, but Britney's single ""Toxic"" more than makes up for MATM's transgressions."
1,Me against the music - the name says it all,"I'm glad to see that Britney Spears has at least publicly acknowledged that she has been waging a war against music. It's still too early to see if good music will win out, or if Britney and her legions of evil who gave her a record contract will ultimately achieve unholy victory.Britney Spears exemplifies what is wrong with the music industry today. There's now just a few corporate conglomerates using their resources try to sell people bad music like this. All the radio stations in this country are practically owned by only two companies, Viacom and Clearchannel, who want the same limited number of ""recognizable"" songs played so as to maximize their advertising revenue. Radio listeners are less likely than ever to have access to good music.Avoid this kind of heavily-promoted garbage and seek out some good music. It's out there if you look for it."
1,Who Is The Real Madonna?,"For Britney Spears, she seems to have entered an all time low with her career. People feel that way about her with her egotistical kiss with Madonna at the MTV Music Video Awards, which was just terrible. Although I'm not ashamed of Madonna for doing outrageous stunts, for Britney to do that has made her into a Manufactured Madonna these past few years. The song she claimed to have kissed Madonna with, Me Against The Music is one of the worst collaborations this year. I thought it was absolutely trashy. For Madonna, she sunk to a low level, and Britney has crashed into an iceberg. To be honest with you, Britney Spears kisses like she pulled on Madonna every time she is on stage now. As for the song, I seriously hope you pull it out, and trash it in the garbage."
3,So this where all the vampire stories sprouted from.,Very wordy but interesting read. Hard to relate to the way of life during this time period.Would recommend this only to horror story enthusiast.
4,Good,just as I thought it should have been. Really like that I could get this one from audiable for free also.
3,"A hard read for younger readers, but worth the effort.","This is the original Dracula responsible for the whole modern-day genre. The flowery archaic language and the often tedious pace of the story may be a bit much for the younger reader interested in the contemporary vampire craze. However, Stoker's tale of the undead provides the contextual and historical background for today's vampire sagas. And its style reveals the civility of nineteenth century culture even under dire circumstances, which is lost in many of today's vampire stories. It is a classic. I have only given it three stars for the reasons I have just mentioned. But at the time it was written I'm sure it was received as a five-star thriller."
4,True classic,"I'd read this back in high school, but the flood of silly vampire books, movies and television lately caused my to brush up on the ""facts"" of the matter again. While the writing and language is, of course, a bit out of date Kindle's dictionary and Wikipedia help keep everything straight. The format, sections of the narrative being told through the journal entries of various characters, causes frequent and convenient breaks in the action for those of us who can only read in spurts or want to squeeze in a bit here and there amid other activities. The story itself is well told and the book highly recommended."
5,Timeless Classic,I gave this book a 5 because I couldn't put it down once I started to read it. I got this book because it's a novel we have to read in my school. I would recommend this book for students and people who like to explore their imagination.
5,Reads Better Than Most Modern Horror,Please read this instead of these wonky modern vampire books. Although it was written in the 19th century it flows in a modern way and the first 50 pages are the best opening of any book in horror history.
4,dracula gave me the chills!,"dont read r.l stine if you are looking for pure horor,read Bram stoker's Dracula.this book takes place in the late 1800s. there are many dark secerets in count draculas castle in transelvania. john harker has yet to discover these hororifing secerets. read this book and others like it such as frankenstien and you will know what scary really means."
3,Really good... until the ending,"As you read you find the book is made up of all the different character's journal entries. This is really creative. I found myself really addicted to it until the end. There is this big build up of a fight to destroy Dracula. With such a big build up, I was dissapointed to find no battle or even a struggle once they find him. Dracula goes out with a whimper. It was almost too easy. Lack luster ending for sure. The Francis Ford Coppola film Bram Stroker's Dracula (1992) is much better. But in all fairness, I am sure for it's time, it could have been so much more. I know Bram Stoker put alot of work and research into learning about the real Dracula, other wise known to some as ""Vald the Impaler"". Bram's character is loosly based on the real man and how he got the idea to write the book."
3,Didn't like it,The only reason i read it is because i had to. If it was by me i would have never finished it. I find it boring and way to long. But this is only my opinion and this shouldn't stope anyone from reading it.
5,Favorite Classic.,"I've always enjoyed how this was written, The separate journal entries. Having multiple narrators kept me very interested in the story, and more attached to each character."
3,Advertised as new but had fluid stains on the pages,"I don't care how ""cheap"" an item sells for, if it is advertised as NEW it needs to be NEW. This book has seen MUCH better days. It was bought as a gift. Now it is MINE. I do not gift USED items !!!"
2,"A classic, but there are other classics","Dracula by Bram Stoker is a classic novel of the 19th century. There is no question about that. Anyone investigating 19th century Western literature or who has a keen interest in disturbing fiction should read this novel. Indeed, Freudian, Darwinist, Niethzean, and Socialist forces were changing the West in the 1800's, and Stoker effectively uses them to frighten the reader. However, Amazon.Com wasn't convenient in the 19th century; it wasn't around. Similarly, what scared middle class Britons in the 19th century just isn't disturbing any longer. So if you want to read a disturbing fiction to be truly disturbed, avoid this. If you want to read a classic 19th century novel, read something by Dickens. Avoid this novel unless you have an acute interest in specifically reading it."
2,Let the dead rest in piece.,"It's getting a bit long in the tooth now. Bram Stokers Dracula was a good book for it's time, but alas times have changed. There are a whole new breed of horror writers focusing on the vampire element in this day and age. You would be better of focusing on one of them. Dracula may be the most famous Vampire of them all, but if it's a good blood curdling horror story you are after there are many, more evil and fierce than he ever was.It's more like a warped version of beauty and the beast. The characters have that kind of melodramatic foppishness that comes with the period it's set in. If you've ever read anything by Brian Lumley then this book may be somewhat disappointing."
3,"Not Twilight... A good, solid classic","I have students turning to this book expecting it to read like The Vampire Lestat by Anne Rice or Twilight by Stephenie Meyers. This book is a classic; it was written for a different audience at a different time; it is not going to replace either of the other titles in the pantheon of vampire fiction. However, it's the base of most vampire fiction, and it's nice to see where the myth and legend start.If you liked Anne Rice, Stephenie Meyer, or even Nora Robert's newest vampire novels, you might really like Bram Stoker, too. Or... you might find that you have a generation gap and that Dracula, the real, classic Dracula, isn't nearly what you'd hoped it would be. If you're expecting Dean Koontz, Stephen King, or Anne Rice at her lush, Lestat verbosity: you will NOT get it with Bram Stoker. Different time, different generation, different message. Vampires in Dracula=BAD."
2,"Good, but there is better out there","The book certainly has its powerful moments. But I was disappointed with the cliche writing. The characters at times risk being plastic. I am sorry there are no half stars available in the rating. I would give it a 2 and a half, rather than a 2."
3,"Great story, not the best ebook version",Story is classic and a must read. There are many ebook versions of this story. This one doesn't have a table of contents. If that isn't important to you then the story is the same.
2,Why is this a classic?,"I don't understand. I don't understand, why this has so many great reviews. I have read Frankenstein, I have read Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Hardy. Some of the best Victorian writers and I don't find this book to be that well written. I honestly have to say, I find it so excrutiatingly boring, dull, poorly written that I can't get past forty pages. Frankestein is great! I will die happy knowing that I have never read this hideously boring book!!!"
5,Dracula,"No one can compare with Bram Stoker's Dracula for sheer unadulteratad horror, imagine yourself in a huge castle with a blood thirsty fiend, and you must find a way out before you become a foul thing of the night that he is, this is a roller coasterride of terror don't miss it.A classic of horror."
3,A teens review,"This book is not very good. The beginnig is great, when he goes to draculas castle but after that it just drags on. i am a HUGE fan of creepy books books and this one is creepy but not creepy enough. MY main complaint is that they spend about 100 pages in the doctors office and it got very boring. This book is great if you have a LOT of patience.p.s. i foound no formatting issues on the new kindle"
5,A True Classic,"A wonderfully written, original, and wholly different novel. 100 plus years later it is still a great read. Scary as hell too!!"
5,Imagine the original horror.....,"...of those first Victorian readers who were unacquainted with all the modern monsters and special effects. The idea of the eternal vampire is an old one from Eastern Europe (originally from Egypt) and the joining of an actual person (Vlad the Impaler) with the legend set the stage for all that was to follow.This book is in the form of a diary, surely one of the best mechanisms available when handled adroitly. The slow seduction of Mina by the Count can be interpreted in a number of ways but the best way is left to the imagination. There is always that ageless quandry - does one become a Vampire, lose one's soul, yet gain immortality? Get the book - better than any of the current crop."
3,Dracula,"I just finished reading this book for the first time and I was surprised by how it differed from the screen versions and masses of works that followed it.Although I was impressed by how Stoker told the story through a series of letters and journal entries in a way that made the characters come alive and the terror leap off the page, I was not impressed by the patronizing and condescending way he referred to the female characters, Lucy and Mina.For the most part, though, I could ignore this factor and enjoy the thrill of the story."
3,Bram Stokers Dracula,"Bram Stokers Dracula is written in the form of journal entries and letters. At the begining of each entry there is a title telling who is writing the entry, this makes the book easy to follow because you know who is talking. There is also alot of suspence in the book that keeps you hooked from one page to the next. Even though the book can be dark it also have emotions thoughout the book."
3,OK for free,I used this book on my HP Touchpad with Kindle app. I have been a big fan of Dracula and vampire movies but had never read the book so I figured it was about time. This ebook is poorly formatted and I spotted a word that was missing or garbled. But at least you get to read the story and since it is free I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Not for Me,A lot going on switching backwards and forwards from diary to diary left me staggering to keep track of the plot and characters. Very boring indeed
3,Like wading through verbal treacle,By the time I had got half way thrugh Drac I was delighted that victorian gothic is as dead as Drac himself but had to read to the end to make sure!
5,Thrilling and well writen classic,"This is actually my first English book that i have read. Even the language is little bit harder to understand in some passages it is actually no bog problem to understand context. Book itself is a masterpiece of thriller, horror and drama. The classy format of diaries, correspondence making feel that you are reading the file of some case is astonishing clever. This book is way to discover history of England/Europe, get thrilled by original story of Dracula and to understand what it mean the word Gentleman."
4,A very exciting book,"The story begins in the small town beside the country of Translvania a man named Johothan Harker is enjoying his little hotel room and he is about to leave when a small lady walks in very excited about St. Georges Day. the lady says to John ""AT 12o'CLOCK ALL EVIL WILL REGAIN IT'S STRENGTH AND EVERY THING GOOD AND HOLY WILL FALL""! not taking her warning he leaves without hesatation to Count Dracula's castle. Well that's the begging if you want to read the rest of the book buy it now at Amazon.com"
1,Mislabeled for Kindle,"No table of contents, extra material not included. Might as well have been the free version."
2,a disappointment,"This is a classic that is not well written, hard to follow, and after so much buildup, rather boring. It is a wonderful example of a mediocre novel that really truly came to life in film, and in the many knockoffs that it spawned, but itself fails to measure up. I simply did not find it an engaging read that transported me to another time and universe with its own rules, which was what I had hoped for. Now, I try to read these classics naively and on their own merits, and I must say that this is one of the more disappointing experiences I have had. This is a matter of taste, but I would warn readers that they may find it similarly, well, bad.Not recommended."
4,Bram Stoker's Dracula Book,"Very good, I was hoping it would be more like the movie though. What I liked about the movie that wasn't in the book was that there was a love story for Dracula. It showed another side of vampires but the book was still a good vampire story."
3,skered,.it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!
4,I read it with my hair standing on end...,"lots of suspense. Please note that the cemetary by the sea, where Dracula lands, has recently (1/2013) had a landslide!Nevertheless, I think that Bram Stoker had a very strange idea about the uses of Holy Communion. I wish the characters had investigated the true use of the Sacred Species -- It is to be consumed by the Faithful! Evil is best combatted within ourselves, don't you think?"
4,Dracula,This is the original Dracula by Bram stoker it is a interesting aww inspiring book I got it for my teenage son he now reads this and other books on the kindle fire I am very pleased with this
2,Bit of a Drag,"I read this before I read Dracula In Love (which I loved and recommend) because I wanted to be up on the storyline of Mina. The first part was interesting but I basically skimmed more than 50% of end because it was so boring. The endless descriptions and flowery language was tiring to slog through.My impressions:Ladies are Madonnas or whores and being touched by a vampire automatically puts you in the latter category.Good, virtuous men are also perfect physical specimens (eugenics anyone?).Blood transfusions can be done indiscriminately on anyone at anytime with no medical repercussions.That's all I can remember from what I read."
3,"Twilight, meet a real vampire","When I first started reading, I fell in love with this book, but after awhile it started to drag on. I understand that Dracula is a classic, therefore really old, but it's not like it's a style of writting I'm unfamiliar with. I don't quite undersyanhow it came to be the greatest vampire story of all time, exceptfor the fact that it was the original. Still it's more entertaining than sparkly Twilight, so I shouldn't complain too much. I am still in love with the classic vampire, Draula, even if his story is a little boring. He is much more awesome than a human shaped bucket of glitter constantlly swooping in to save a shallow clutz. Fans of Twilight should read this to understand what a real vampire is(hint: it's not Edward)"
3,Yeah It's A Classic...,"Dracula is a classic. If you like horror books, even a little try this book. A very entertaining story that will, thrill, chill and amaze you to the very end! Dracula is a classic but I didn't like it that much ( thats why I gave it three stars, but a very good story. )Try It Out."
4,Weak Ending but Great Book Nonetheless,"This book is much better than I expected it to be.It might take some time to get used to the 19th-Century language, but what amazed me is how modern the pacing and atmospheric imagery is in a book written in the late 1800s. Except for the language pointed out above, it really feels like it's a film script completed last week. I also like having it written from different characters' perspectives through their various journals, diaries, and letters. The one thing that I thought could have been better is the ending. It's simply very abrupt, and I felt, unsatisfying. With so much buildup, I thought there could have been, and should have been, A LOT more action at the end. Still, that should not keep you from reading the book. You've probably seen dozens of Dracula movies through the years, and this is in large part the genesis of all of that, and the reason why to this day people are obsessed with this fascinating character."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this classic. Vampire fans, give it a read. It's a classic for a reason."
4,You don't know dracula until your read this book,"I was surprised by the story. You may think you know the story, but you don't. The book is different than most of the movies. The story is told from the journals of the characters. The battle with Dracula is much more real than any of the movies portrays. He is pure evil, he is not the handsome devil that the movies show. Until you read this book you don't know the real story."
3,The Father of Vampires,"The book condition was moderate. I bought the bargain price hardcover and I know why it costed so little. The spine was detached from the pages and the red color on the pages was more faded than the other books I purchased, Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. I just had my school librarian put some book glue in the spine and everything should be good as new tomorrow. The subject matter is amazing. It is the basis of all vampire stories, once you read it, I believe you would be amazed at how it was originally written."
3,All sliced up!,"A good read that's better in the unabridged version. Can't beat the value, but, if you really like it, there's a more authentic tale to be found."
3,Very little vampire,"I was so looking forward to this, but it was a slow start and not much Dracula action until way into the book. Pretty slow."
3,poor translation,"I enjoyed the story and I got on well with the writing style the first half of the book, and then it abruptly changed and it became disjointed. I believe there were too different translation combined and that made it diconcerning. I'm not interested in finishing the book due to this unusual switch in prose."
3,good classic,"This book was chosen for my book club, so I read it dutifully. As it is not one I would have picked for myself, I was sceptical. However, I enjoyed it. It's completely different than any modern movie version, not sexual at all (like the movies and well-known reviewers would have you believe). And I was grateful for that.There are many main characters, and therefore many different points of view that the author writes from. It can get confusing at times, but not too bad. It all ends well (as well as a vampire story can) in the end. There are some dead people and some people left recovering from Dracula's spell. But evil is defeated and good wins out. What else could you ask for? Definitely a classic."
3,"Boring, Wordy, Repetitive","I'm not a thriller fan and don't think I've ever watched the dracula movie all the way through so it's not surprising that I don't like this book. I'm just 80% through with this book and every page is an effort. I try to read one chapter every day (about 10 pages), but it's very easy to put down before I get to the end of the chapter. It is wordy, repetitive, boring. I hate the half-page sentences and page-long paragraphs. On the plus side, it does have a story that follows logically and doesn't have daisies blooming in January. My perception is that the theme is good vs. evil although I'm aware that there are other views. The book is sprinkled liberally throughout with bits of wisdom, and it contains numerous Biblical references. The good guys are bound by a sense of duty. Count Dracula is evil personified. I think editing it and cutting half of it out would improve it a great deal. However, it is a classic and has lasted more than a century so who am I to judge."
4,Free book. No table of contents. So what not like you are skipping ahead or going back...,This is a book that you have to read all the way through. There is no going back in case you missed something. So if you missed something six chapters ago you better book mark each chapter so you can get back to it. Good luck.
3,Dracula by Janai,I thought it was a good book but just not what I was looking for and that's ok. Thanks for writing
4,Great addition to library,"Good book, good quality and a great addition to anyone's home library collection. It's just not the same if it is digital."
3,Free,"It was a free download. Nothing to complain about there. I thought a classic like this would be entertaining, or enlightening, or thought provoking. It was mostly boring."
3,Dracula,I read it for a literature class for lifelonglearners. It will be interesting to discuss some of the issues such as euthanasia. I found the book drawn out and repetitive. It could have been written with half the pages.
4,Believe it or not...,"PHONOGRAPH DIARYSPOKEN BY VAN HELSINGNovember 8 - Ooh...for a long time during my old age he remain yonder, as Friend Quincey would say, but now he swell up at thought of Madam Lucy and Madam Mina together. He...Mein Gott! I did not realize I was recording!This is the story of courageous men, woman with man-brain, and undead with child-brain. From Transylvania to London and back on ship, our heroes traverse much to rid the world of unrelenting evil, a most fractious beast. However, I stop now, though my impulse tells me to disclose more, I tell him no."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"A good book? Yes. An excellent book? No. Whether or not this book is a classic is undebatable, but I disagree with the high esteem in which it is usually held. The character's in the book are too one dimensional. They don't really express the wide range of emotions we would expect in real people; they are entirely too predictable. The story, too, while containing some admirable elements, is not as exciting as, say, ""Frankenstein"" or ""Great Expectations"". The plot tends to plod along while you wait for something to happen. In short, as a foundation of modern horror, this book is a must. But as a satisfying literary experience in and of itself, this book falls short of it's potential."
1,One of the worst books EVER!,Could be my least favorite book ever. I won't say it was awful because who am I to say a supposed great piece of literary art work is crap. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it!
3,I' seen better,"Dracula was a huge dissapointment, I expected a book that would make me have trouble sleeping at night. Instead I got a bland ending and a predictable plot. It had too much fluff and not enough adventure. There was only one part in the story in which I was slightly scared. I would deffinately not recomend this book to anyone."
2,confusing,"i am a freshmen in highschool reading at a colledge level i have read atlas shrugged,frankenstein and many books by shakespear but this confuses me but still a good book"
2,Reader Beware!,"Bram Stoker wrote the perfect gothic novel, and Jan Needle (so-called ""editor"") has butchered it in this edition. This is NOT Bram Stoker's original novel, it is an abridged version. Whole passages are missing, condensed or summarized. The language has been modernized, and the story has lost much of its period flavor. Poor Mr. Stoker must be turning in his grave.Admittedly, some younger readers might appreciate not having to cope with a novel written in Victorian English, and the simplified delivery might suit some readers. But remember- this is a PERIOD novel, and translating it into contempory language inevitably and irredeemably changes its character.On a plus side, the wonderful illustrations lend atmosphere, and the blood-soaked pages are suitably grisly."
1,Terrible,"As stated by another reader, this is *NOT* Dracula. This is a ""Modernized for the 21st Century Reader Edition"" variation of the original. Another way to describe it would be ""Dumbed down for a third grader edition"".All of the feel, most of the character, and part of the story are completely gone.Do not bother with this if you want Bram Stoker's Dracula."
3,Brilliant Open and Finish but Middle Goes On and on and on,Stoker's Dracula is a classic I probably would not have picked up if it we not free on my Kindle. The opening third of this book is BEAUTIFUL. You are immediately brount into Jonathon's world of working for the Count and you can feel his fear and worry as he begins to discover the odd truth about the man. I loved it .... until the story shifts back to London. This is where this novel lost me. I didn't feel engaged with any of the characters and the intrigue and suspense created in the beginning just vanished like Dracula in the mist. This is a classic for a reason and when they go on their last quest the book does bring you back in. I read two thirds of this book in just a few days. That middle part took me three weeks. Be patient with this one and you may find yourself rewarded.
4,Wow,"This book is great. It had me hanging onto every word, wondering what would happen next. If you like the new fad going around with vampire books then you have to read Dracula, the original."
4,A Historic Contribution to the Genre,"Read this book not with your wise new 2010 eyes, but with the 1897 eyes of Bram Stoker's first readers. First, note the unique literary style, sequences from journals and letters of the protagonists. This would have enhanced the realism to the book's early readers. Also, note the power of the crucifix and the communion wafer. The world of a hundred years ago adhered to a religious fundamentalism that is now found principally among those whom civilization has left behind. The supernatural elements are portrayed as perfectly realistic and the reader is genuinely terrified of the Count and his converts. If you cannot discipline yourself to put on those one hundred year old eyes, however, you may find this book to be little more than an interesting entrant in the history of science fiction, without the tension. Now, if you really want to feel terror, try warding off a hoard of modern fiction's monsters with a crucifix."
4,"Often imitated, never duplicated","The original Dracula. All others are poor imitators. As a red-blooded vampire lover, I was entertained. A little slow for modern tastes, but a good solid story nonetheless."
3,Kinda boring,It was alright at first but it took me ages to get to 50 pages from the end. By then I just sparknoted it because I wanted to know the ending but couldn't bring myself to read it anymore.
4,Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Dracula movie should read this classic,"Not as great a novel as Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" but fun to read. Here are ill-fated Lucy, her friend Mina and her husband Jonathan, and, that scourge of vampires, Prof. Van Helsing. The story can be irritating at times. For example, when Van Helsing holds back information or plans from his vampire hunting partners, it doesn't seem to make sense, and I'm not sure that the story requires it. But it's Bram Stoker's story!"
3,Never Watch a Movie Based on A Novel,"Dracula is a book tucked into the library of our culture's soul. It brought light to darker worlds and different lifestyles. Abraham Stoker, an advocate of censorship in his time, would have been shocked at today's perception of sexuality in his novel. Dracula was Stoker's masterpiece, but the work itself is somewhat flawed. The flow is meandering and the characters are static. It is best to read this book as a means of better understanding the modern mind and the affect the myth of vampires has had on it. No film portrayal has capture the true feel of this book. At his best, Stoker presents everyday people thrust into bizarre and harrowing circumstances that touch on a tapestry of dark beauty that causes the spine to ache as much as throb."
3,A true classic,"I read this book when I was youngish and I guess if I read it now I would understand it better but still, I do recall how much I enjoyed and was scared by it. The scene with the monster in the park stalking Lucy or the one were the female vampires enter Jonathans room are somewhat prominant in my mind. Bram Stoker made a classic when he wrote this and paved the way for horror writers such as Anne Rice or Steven King. Thoroughly enjoyable"
2,"If you're looking for a heart-stopping thriller, look elsewhere","Somehow I managed to read this one cover to cover, but only through a monumental effort. I found this book to be the driest I have ever read, and that includes Great Expectations, War of the Worlds, and Moby Dick. The only reason I forced myself to get through it was because I felt that in order to properly critique modern versions of vampires, I needed to know the appearance and abilities of the original.Dracula is undoubtably a beautiful example of the period's writing, but when it comes to horror, the story falls flat."
4,A pretty good one,The story is of course classic and worth reading still. All due lauding.The format is completely readable with only a few minor mistakes and the occasional odd line break.Definitely worth it.
2,Poor scanning,The story is marvelous. Unfortunately this version seems to have been scanned by a group of drunk monkeys. I have never seen so many scan errors in my life. Shame
5,Vampire Lore,"Count Dracula: a nocturnal creature who preys on the innocent, the beautiful, and the helpless. A satanic figure who strikes terror in the heart of humanity. A monster who sucks on the blood of living people for sustenance.Bram Stoker's _Dracula_ is a gripping read that will scare you out of your wits. It is written in diary form from the perspective of various human characters in the story, thus representing Dracula as real-life people would see him.It is quintessentially a suspense novel with fantastic elements. Well-written and a joy to read. END"
4,Superb fiction,"This book was amazingly revolutionary, very sexual, very violent, very controversial, and very spiritual. Some of the other readers must have been expecting to read something like Anne Rice, but you have to understand when this was written. Bram Stoker was taking a big risk with this book and that's strongly evident in the way this book is worded. The style was also new to the time; no one would have really thought of writing a book this way. This book was very exciting, contrary to what other readers may have said. Dracula may be hard to read but is a book you'll be glad you'd read when you're done."
4,A classic that never dies,"This is a book that shouldn't be a classic, but there's something about the theme that is so enduring and powerful it refuses to simply curl up and die. Indeed, Vampires continue to be compelling. And it is possible to give them a new and fresh twist. For a modern slant on the story take a look at Simon Clark's Vampyrrhic on the UK arm of Amazon. It's been getting some rave revies."
5,Read for your self!,"WHAT CAN I SAY? GREAT BOOK. WHEN A MAN GOES ON A BUISSNESS TRIP TO A MAN, HE FINDS HE WISHED HE HADNEVER GONE. THIS BOOKS HAS EVERYTHIG. YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK AT NIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU! YOU WISH YOU HAD NEVER PICKED UP THE BOOK SOMETIMES. IT IS JUST THE KIND OF VAMPIRE STORY YOU WOULD EVER WANT TO READ!"
4,Entertaining Read/Decent Edition,"If you're looking for a suspense-filled, supernatural, mystery that is also a classic, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a great choice. For a majority of the book I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next. The format used is a collection of journal entries and letters which makes this book unique for its time and helps heighten the suspense and make it seem more real. In a couple of spots, things get slow, but for the most part it's a fun read. The story is fairly well known, but you may be a little surprised about some of the twists and turns. Well worth the read."
5,Great Classic,Dracula was the first book I read with my new Kindle. I ordered so many classics all for free and it was plain luck to choose this old classic. What a great story I'm so happy I got it and having an idea what the story was from the old black and white movies the story as is the normal case much better than can ever be put on the screen.As for the new kindle WOW I haven't been able to read more than a few pages at a time for years and with the ability to adjust the font size and typeface I read for HOURS. This is by far the best investment I've made this year. I can't wait to read the 1000's of free classic books available at my fingertips.
4,Good Book,"Reading Dracula was time well spent. The book was easier to read than I thought it would be given the time in which it was written. There were some parts that aged the book and Bram could have done without a lot of the character praise, but other than that, Dracula made a good vampire."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I downloaded and read it because it was free and a classic. Glad I did. It is not, really, engrossing."
5,dracula is my number one book,i love this book so much the movie was great but i have to say i love the book just a little more .if your a vampire lover this book is for you .its everything you would wont in a vampire romance novel.
5,Can't put it down,"This vampire book is wayyyy better than ANY of the new ones out there! This is the original, and all others are poor copies. This is a story that is original, coming straight from Bram's mind, whereas all of the others come from this book, or from TV shows like Buffy."
4,Dracula. The socalled masterpiece.,In a world of modern technology and advancements that could ask the questions of God and life there is Dracula. whos mere prescence declares that there are things which could not be explained by science. The book is well written and leaves the reader largely unaware of the terrors lurking in the night. I read this book to get a feel of the vampire roots. i was not let down. That was until the end. when dracula and all the demonic creations were finished off so quickly that it felt more like a cop out rather than the ending to a masterpiece. that i was expecting. On the whole the book was fantastic. Until the end.
1,Dracula,"Boring I do not like this book it does not have a good ""hook""and ""lead"" I did not like the first chapter at all it is boring"
2,Better in Memory than in the Actual Reading,"I realize my heresy in saying so, but Dracula is painfully overwritten, overwrought, and overrated. There are about 20 good pages which are countered by over 450 of pure dreck. Don't even get me started with Van Helsing's painful ""dialect,"" which is like the worst writing of Twain and Stephen Crane when they did the same thing. The myth and idea of the Count have staying power, but the novel is as dull as dirt. I know all the critical reasons for its popularity, but all of these strike me as very strained."
2,Eh,"Maybe I just started reading it with the wrong idea in mind but it seemed rather boring to me. The first chapter was absolutely chilling as was the ship scene, but the rest of the book was just dull. However its free so by all means read read read."
5,Loved it!,"This book was captivating from the beginning to the end!What a wonderful world of mystery and suspense Bram Stoker has opened up for me. In addition to great reading, the book was FREE! Thank you KINDLE and AMAZON!!"
3,Bram Stoker: Dracula,"The classic book, written in the late 19th century. Written in the style of diary entries from the various charaters, the story is still compelling and entertaining. The writing style allows you to view the story as it unfolds to each of the charaters and how their personalities interact.Even with the 1990's movie (which follows the story-line very closely to the book) the book is still worth the read."
4,The Original version,"This book was written a long time ago. Styles were different, and reader expectations were different. But it is still a good story, and it was fun to see the great-grandfather of all vampire books and movies."
3,"A Novel that Demands Respect, but...","""Dracula"" has to be read because it's the definitive item in terms of vampire fiction. It pretty much gave birth to the genre, and for that reason at least it demands respect.But, in short, and putting all literary pretension to one side; the meandering plot told as phlegmatic diary entries from umpteen different perspectives and the dawdling pace at which the now overly-familiar (to a modern reader) events unfold make this a crushing bore of a gothic novel."
1,1 STARS BECAUSE OF DAMAGE,"I give this 1 star because the book arrived damaged, the red page edges had alot of damage, corners was damaged badly, It had a bad scratch down the middle of the pic on front, the back looked like it had been rubbed around on the floor and the binding was broke. I returned it got a 2nd copy and it was just about as bad. To me, Both copies looked USED not new."
1,Have yet to finish it.,"After owning the book for three years, I've yet to finish it. In style it is archaic, the method being used to advance the plot being in disuse since quite some time and as a result it is a great deterrent to the modern reader."
1,You call this a classic?,"I call it a joke. The movie was so much better even with Keanu Reeves' awful acting. I was completely disappointed with this book and still have no idea why I bothered to finish it. I was looking for the epic love story with Nina and the count, that does not exist here. Watch the movie and save yourself some time."
1,Very stupid book,Dracula is the worst book I ever had to read for english class. It was so stupid and the movie was even stupider. Don't waste your time reading garbage like this book.
4,For high school class,"I purchased Dover Thrift Editions version of Dracula to use with a high school literature class. To be fair, it was the most economical unabridged version, but there wasn't a whole lot of room for annotating. For us, it met our needs, but just barely. If you need more space for writing, you may want to consider a different version."
5,"A classic, what more can you say?","This was my first book purchase, a paperback in 1958 or so. Reading it again all these years later is still enjoyable."
5,Dracula,"LOOOOVEEE Dracula!!! Bram Stoker does an amazing job creating this story. Dracula is the traditional Vampire, the original. It's amazing how these new-age vampires are so incredibly different, time really does change things. Nothing beats the original. Definitely a must read for anyone who is into the supernatural stuff."
3,Old Fashioned but still entertaining,Style is a little trying but the horror holds up well if you allow yourself to be drawn in.A good easy read for a plane trip in between current novels
5,Still the greatest vampire story of all,"Deep and Freudian, full of unconscious images and atmosphere. Shows up Ann Rice for the writer of trash that she is. Unsurpassed"
4,i havent been able to finish reading this book but im sure it is great. i have heard it is good so one day i will read it!,i havent been able to finish reading this book but im sure it is great. i have heard it is good so one day i will read it!
3,didn't read,"I was able to download this for free, but I never read it. I've heard it's a really good read though."
1,Very poor,Lines of the text not properly aligned on page of my Kindle. Doesn't seem to be a list of chapters at beginning.
2,Not for me,Just not my cup of tea. The description of the land and area was masterful but still not my kind of book.
3,Dracula,"Authors have written better vampire novels since Stoker's, but this book laid the ground work. It does not read as well now as it originally did due to the modern expectations related to vampire fiction. It is very atmospheric; but while its journal/letter style creates immediacy, it also makes for a choppy narrative flow. Some readers may find that disturbing. Despite its flaws, this book should be in any serious collection of classics or of horror genre."
4,The Book that Started it ALL,"And apparently it is free on Kindle now. The book's been around forever, so the fact that books of this caliber are now in the public domain is an opportunity that the public should not waste.The book is a creative masterwork for its time, and in commercial terms, may be the most influential book ever written other than the Bible or the Odyssey.It is structured in a unique way, with the book present as letters and correspondence between the characters. In addition to its being a compelling story, its format is itself an interesting experience.One that you should definitely give a go at some point in your life."
3,"Don't Get Fooled by the ""Gorey Illustrations""","I'm a fan of the novel but I bought this particular edition because of the Gorey illustrations - save your money. There are about 10 illustrations - 50 pages in between each (I'm approximating) and they are just pictures of characters, by themselves, doing just about nothing. I love Gorey but his humor doesn't serve Stoker's tone. There has got to be a better illustrated edition.I will say however that the introduction is quite interesting and informative."
2,"Pretty, but abridged","I was intending to buy a novel for my nephew, one which I had read unabridged and enjoyed immensely. Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the ""editor"" was in fact an ""abridger"" and that lots of the original text was gone. This abridgement was not listed under book details; I wish I had scrolled down to the reveiws. Now I have to go through the hassle of return, shipping charges, etc."
5,Poetic,Very much enjoyed reading this book. I loved the writing style which is much different from todays writing. I loved the way it flowed it was very lyrical. The characters were captivating they kept me hooked to the story waiting to find out what happens to them.
3,Excellent,"It was a unique original book, I am in middle school and Love reading. This book I recommend for all ages above 6th grade."
5,Excellent,"There's a reason why they call them classics! Just hang on through the first few pages until Jonathan Harker makes it to the Count' s castle, and you won't be able to put it down."
3,Accept this as another version and you're okay,"I must say I have not read the original Dracula, what I am reviewing now is the free Kindle version, which I knew had been reported as improperly edited, modernized, and ""dumbed down"" for today's audience. To be honest, I could tell these things as I was reading it. There were times when I thought, ""Certainly the first edition didn't use language like this, it's far too modern!""That said, I quickly became involved in the edited version all the same. There are so very many versions of Dracula out there that you have to be willing to accept that you won't get the original every time you encounter it. If you approach the edited version knowing that, you will probably enjoy the experience. You might even enjoy it enough to pick up the ""proper"" version and read that too, which is something I am looking forward to doing."
2,"Dracula - Book fine, format not for kindle","I bought the book from amazon as it was $1 rather than looking for another version. After getting part way in I had to find another version as the formatting was weird and hard to read.The book is great, I just wouldn't buy it from Amazon unless they have fixed the formatting for kindle."
3,Dracula,Dracula By Bram Stoker has a very good story to it but it doesn't have much exitment in it. The book is written through journals by people who all become connected together through out the story to stop Dracula. The book would be alot better if it had more excitment and also some suspense.
5,a favorite,One of my favorite novels. And on the kindle to boot. Free books are nice..Very good read for everyone. m
3,Dracula,"It served as a fun romp during the Halloween season. It dragged a bit in the middle, but I enjoyed comparing it to the landmark movie of the same name that starred Bella Lagosi in the early 30s which spawned the vampire genre for future books, movies and TV shows."
3,The idea of Dracula,"The idea of Dracula holds forth in popular culture and continues today.While Stoker was not the first to write of a Vampire, his hit a nerve with the culture-consuming public. However, as one of those consumers now, I feel that through so many different iterations and versions of the myth, returning to the source is not entirely fruitful.Stoker's satanic superman is unstoppable, until the time that he is stopped. The foundations of the myth are here, but no fun is had. Stoker is a middling writer; while he was popular in his time only his Dracula passes down to us. The characters are flat and uneven. The pseudo-epistolary form has many weaknesses if you want to fall into the story. The party's events are based on contrived coincidences. Frankly, it is a waste of time for anyone but the student of the period or genre."
4,Dracula,"Part of the appeal of Kindle was to acquire and read some of the ""classics"" I missed going through school. Although, I'd already read enough to know that by current-day standards it's not always the most ""reader-friendly"" endeavor. Nonetheless, Bram Stoker needed an editor! Too much detail in the first half of the book and at one point it went in such a different direction I wasn't sure I was still reading the same book! HOWEVER, it all comes together in the second half and the charcter of Mina Harker is so ahead of her time, it made it all worthwhile! She's a woman wildly respected by the men she kept company with and who devoted themselves to saving her life. And this is a tale nothing like Hollywood has played it. Worth the effort."
3,Kindle version of Dracula,"My review is not so much on the story of Dracula, which is a great one and I do highly recommend. But the problem is with this particular version of Dracula on Kindle. Words are missing here and there and it is annoying. The active table of contents does not seem to work quite right either. But the book itself, get it and read it. It is truly a classic."
4,If you want to be a writer its a must,"Dracula is an amazing lesson on the characterization. Stocker impersonates a lot of different characters with different personalities and he does it flawless. You can tell in the way each one talks and acts how different they are.Besides, it is a very very well written novel and a true acomplishement to create one of the most famous and biggest evils on the movie and book world without even portraiting him that much.*sorry for errors, I speak spanish"
4,Dracula!,"First of all, this is a long book - not like other thrillers like ""Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde."" The story is told through a variety of people, easily put together by journals of all the protaginists (I wonder what Dracula's journal would have read). I really enjoyed Jonathan Harker's journals at the beginning when he first visits Dracula's castle in the Transylvania. After that, the thrill drops a lot, as it becomes more narative.One thing I did not like was that two main characters were named Jonathan, and were hard to distinguish when individual journals referrenced only ""Jonathan."""
3,Long but a classic,I have always wanted to read this book and loved it until about 4:5 of the way through! The descriptions seem never ending and it can be challenging to understand what van Helsing is meant to be saying. Other than that it's worth reading and its interesting to read how the characteristics/afflictions that Dracula has have been used in modern books or movies!
3,rambling,"Although I enjoyed this book, I can't give it more than three stars. At points in the book as your reading its very interesting and holds your attention, then next you know it goes into a lot of rambling that totally brings the interest point to 0. I found myself skipping pages especially towards the end. The ending leaves you saying ""is that it""!"
3,Dracu-blah,"There is a stretch of the PCH just South of Point Mugu and a bit North of Malibu, that has been in so many car commercials that you can't help but have a sense of deja vu when you drive it even if you've never been there. That is how this book went for me. I felt like I was reading a very, very, very long winded treatment for every movie from ""Nosferatu"" to ""Love Bites"". Unless you are a glutton for this type of work or a die hard vampire-phile, give it a pass."
5,Creepiness deserved classic status,"I'd forgotten just how much of this takes place in two countries at once and how Jonathan being alone made the whole thing creepier. A really good read, not jump up scary, but also not a great idea right before bed."
3,A BIT more of a commitment than the movie,"This novel, steeped in over-the-top old English, really just ends up being more of a chore to read than a leisurely activity. I prefer the motion picture, honestly."
5,Love it!,I absolutely love the book so far! It's a great suspense builder. It is a great read! I love it.
4,Great,"A must read classic. No romantic sparkling vampires, honest creatures of the night that just might keep you from sleep a few minutes more."
3,I found it very drawn out,"I have audible and book. I found it easier to read the book. Maybe it was the actors that put me off. The different voices and acting and over acting changed the feeling of the story. The actual story is good and holds up to todays writing on similar themes.Overall I thought the story was very drawn out, maybe an abridged version would have got to the point sooner."
2,Boring and hard to focus,Letters and memos back and forth between characters. Book just hard to follow. Learned a lot about the story I didn't know though.
1,Dracula,I do not like this story. It is boring to me. I like to read stories and books that are useful to my knowledge.
3,A classic read,"A phenomenal (and classic) story that Stoker weaves together mainly fromdiary-entries story-telling. But despite the creative brilliance, the bookis also quite slow and even repetitive i the middle parts.The interaction between the characters is also over-dramatizedand over-emotional in many places.But despite these shortcomings, the read is highly captivating."
5,An unquenchable classic,It makes the movies plae in comparison. Read it while books are still made with paper!
1,Not Sure What Happened Here,"I thought this was Dracula, but it seems to be some other version of it. I love the original, but not this."
3,"Great, bad, good.","That's how it went for me anyway. It started off really creepy and well done from the perspective of Jonathon Harker but then it got too slow in the middle. After the characters spent a lot of time writing things down and trying to think, it got good again for about the last 50 pages. Overall a good read but I'm not sure horror books stand up to horror movies."
4,its not twilight people :),Very original. I wasnt expecting it to be good but hey it was. Hey guys its not Twilight. There is no such thing as vegeterian vamps in this book :)
4,Good Book,The only thing keeping this from being 5 stars is that it became too populaur. Had I not known all about Vampires and Dracula before I read the book it would have been much better. Alot of the mystery that stoker tried to conceal Dracula with was blown because I already knew what was going on and what was going to happen. If you know little about Dracula then this is deffiantly a book for you it kept me reading even though I knew exactly what was going to happen.
3,Milestone of the genre,"A milestone of the genre, Dracula was more enjoyable than I feared. Many classics just don't translate well in the modern world. Dracula does have some of those weepy emotional moments, so common to 19th century literature. Also I am usually leery of stories told by the device of letters and diaries. However Dracula starts off very compellingly with Jonathan Harker's visit to Transylvania. The story drags a bit when the Count reaches London, but picks up after the death of Lucy. Unfortunately, the story never regains the creepy feeling of the beginning; mainly because the count remains a vague menace off page for almost the whole last two thirds of the book."
4,Fun Read!,The language was difficult to get through at some points and there were a few times when the plot slowed down to a crawl but overall I found reading this book to be very enjoyable.
4,Pretty good.,"In all, it was pretty good. Has some slow spots (what doesn't, really?), and a few very slow spots, and very few truly exciting bits. Aside from these, the pace is, perhaps, a steady walk (more than a stroll or plod, but less than a jog or run). Like many books of the time, the language can occasionally be cumbersome and wordy. When the letters between Mina and Lucy begin, the story seems lost, and it's difficult to get through for a bit, until enough details are revealed so that we can see what is happening, even if they cannot. Wasn't scary. Actually, I laughed more than I sat in horror. Pay attention to the details and the dates to get the most out of it."
2,Why is this a Classic?,"OK, why is this book required reading for high school students? It is very long and I think that Bram Stoker was german anyway that's gotta get people confused. All of the sentances are backwords! It took me 4 whole days to read it, my entire thanksgiving weekend. So highschoolers if you have a choice...don't read this book."
2,Sorry Bram this story didn't stoke her.,I was very excited to read this story and I understood it would be a harder read. I was quickly pulled into the story but it seemed never ending. It is one time that I would say watch the movie!
1,disappointed,"i so looked forward to this but was so bitterly disappointed ~ i couldn't wait for it to end! to say it was tedious is a tremendous understatement. i realise that the classics were written almost in another language to that used today, and other classics i still love, but this writing seemed egotistical in a way... wordy beyond description. there was no time that i felt any emotion, be it fear, horror, tenderness or any other! i'm just glad that although my valuable time was wasted, it cost me so little of my money at least."
1,Beware of These Tapes: They Don't Work,These tapes employ a technology that may not work in your machines. They require a balance dial on your tape player. None of my recently-bought machines have this dial and so the tapes are just junk to me.
1,Crapula,"Me being the avid vampire fan that I am, I'm always willing to read new vampire fiction. The librarian suggested this one to me so I thought I'd give it a shot.What a terrible read. I couldn't stand it for long, so I started skimming through the thing. Turns out the vampire in this book is an old guy, and he lives in a castle! What?! Any vampire fan knows that vampires roam the streets of upper middle class suburbia and high schools. Whoever this Bram Stoker guy is, it's quite clear that he doesn't know a thing on vampires, and his attempt to cash in on the vampire craze is indeed a failure.I'll be returning this on my next trip to the library and sticking to the teen reading section for finding my next vampire novel.(New Moon comes out November 20th, woooooo!)"
1,How did this achieve classic status?,"I'm an avid reader and vampire fan. Over the past couple years I've started a collection of vampire books which totals over 100 now and I figured what vampire collection would be complete without Dracula, the one that started it all? I started reading this book almost 3 weeks ago...and I'm just now halfway through. I don't like to give up on a book, but I just don't think I can waste another 2 or 3 weeks on this. In the first 200 pages there have literally been less than a handful of short-lived moments that were actually interesting. Other than that it feels like NOTHING is happening. There's no STORY here.I can't help but wonder what are the standards when it comes to classic books...Is it simply being old? Groundbreaking? Longevity? I guess Dracula has all that going for it...it's certainly old, was the first of it's kind and people are still reading it more than 100 year after the fact. However, that does not a good book make, in my humble opinion."
3,Okay,I purchased this after reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein just to say I had read it. It was difficult for me to get into and at times follow.
5,original [ original] and still great story,"The true beginning of a wonderful modern near obsession ,these undead will live forever. [and outside of the mutilation and terror everybody is so charmingly polite to each other]."
4,Nothing like the movies I've seen,This was an interesting look at the first vampire and the end was a great way to wrap it up.
3,Required reading,I was glad th hat I was assigned this or I would have never read it. Audiotape made it more fun
3,Review!,"This is not a bad book, but it's not really what I expected. It starts off really interesting, but I lost interest about halfway through. I read the wiki article to see how it ended and it seems cool, but drawn out."
5,Dracula,"I always did love watching the Dracula movies,but the book is much better.For the book pulls you into the story and I couldn't stop reading it until I was done reading the whole book.I say that everyone should read it st least once."
4,Intrestingly Scary,This book remained a thriller in my heart for many years. Some things are still confusing to me and the articulatness of the book describes the setting throughly however it gets confusing after chapter 5. It is a must read book of the century.
5,"Stoker, Bram:Dracula","The story of Dracula will drag you in and will not let you go even if you know you have to iron your dress for tomorrow's conference! Dracula has the power to make one feel disgusted and sorry for him. The book offers unforgetable excitement of a constant tension, fear and relief. It makes you dive into the vampire's thoughts and worries of dealing with the changes of the new society and its evolution."
4,Captive reading.,"This is a book that holds up incredibly well almost 100 years after it was written. An easy read; I found it hard to put down. A great, scary story full of romance, intrigue, and foreign lands which the author describes so vividly it's easy to visualize"
5,Dover makes Dracula accessible to the masses,"Dover's thrift editions are always nice for getting classroom sets for teachers trying to make do with having no money and still trying to provoke their students in reading and learning. ""Dracula"" is not traditional classroom fare, with ""Frankenstein"" a more traditional choice since it deals with humans doing things they were not meant to do. But Stoker's vampire novel can still provoke some intriguing classroom discussions over the use of different first person narratives, the elements of horror, and the willinging suspension of disbelief. Given all the variations on Dracula in films, it may well be worthwhile to talk about the range of interpretation versus being faithful to an author's original vision. For some classes, this might be worth a shot and Dover makes it economically feasible."
4,Good but not the best.,"As a whole, ""Dracula"" is a solid book, but not a great one. It is cursed with an overbearing patriarchal tone, a clear lack of character development, and apart from the initial chapters fails to explore the most ineresting of its character--Dracula. All the same, I did enjoy the overall story, and would recommend it. Its flaws are, for the most part, born of the era in which it was written, and are therefore excusable; yet, Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" is a far superior read for those interested in early supernatural fiction."
3,Classic Tale of Horror Falls Short,"There is no doubt that Dracula is one of the most popular horror stories to ever be written. It has been adapted into numerous movies and plays. The story is intriguing which is what caused me to pick up the book in the first place. However i feel that the book left more to be desired.The book starts off with the fascinating and many times frightening experiences of Jonathan Harker in Dracula's castle. Afterwards, however, i feel that the novel loses focus. The story line slows and focus seems to be on Lucy instead of Mina, the herione. Overall the book was good although it seems to be slow at times it is still worth the read."
3,"boring, but important","Is 'Dracula,' a classic because it's really that great of a book? Or is it because of the mass influence it's had on culture? I'm going with the latter.I found it, overall, to be a pretty boring book, our glimpses of Dracula are slim, the only interesting narratives are those of Lucy & Mina, & Stoker's overwhelming message of women + sex = way too scary for any decent man to handle, is pretty annoying.So read it because it's a classic, & because without it legions of great movies & books may have never been written, but if you're looking for excitement, stop at go."
3,Unforgettable -- but tedious,"Dracula really existed. The old legend has at its core a historical figure: Vlad Tepes, the impaler, a 15th century Transylvanian nobleman noted for making kebabs out of captured Turkish soldiers.The legend of Dracula will probably outlive the works of Dickens and Tolstoy, but the life of the real Vlad Tepes -- if it could be written -- was probably more interesting than this tepid, late-Victorian novel that takes place mostly in England. The best part of the book is the first 50 pages: Jonathan Harker's journal of his visit to Transylvania and his frightening encounter with Dracula. The rest of the book could be condensed by one-half and even then it wouldn't be all that exciting or frightening.So, read the book because the story of Dracula is hugely important in popular culture -- but don't expect too much."
1,one long monolog,OMG I cant believe i actually finished this book. It is a miracle that this book ever started the vampire crazzzzzzze...Sry i fell asleep writing this review of the most boring book I've ever read. The only reason i fought to finish it is to say i went through it . Like climbing a mountian..why because it was there.....Now to read something more interesting like my lawn mowers owners manual.
5,Blood Sucking,This is truly a good book. the whole story is excellent. One of the best classics I have ever read. The characters are so unique. One of the things I liked is how you are reading throug there diaries. If you are looking for a good book to read then this is the one.
4,Classic for a reason,"The classic tale of Dracula is such a classic horror story. I loved it. With it's twists and hills and sharp turns, it kept me hooked until the very end. Although, the beginning is somewhat slow, as well as some parts towards the middle, if you keep reading, you will realize that these parts are important to help you understand the rest. Dracula being an awesome villin, and the other characters being so good hearted, I found it a joy to read. I definately reccomend it. Some of my other favorites are, Subterranean, Carrie, The Shining, and To Kill a Mockingbird(which is nothing like Dracula, but a goodie all the same)."
4,A Good Read for Halloween,"This is an interesting book for anyone, no matter if you are interested in horror or not. There are many different interpretations of the meaning of this story, but I like to think of it as the ""dark side"" of Victorian literature. It is also interesting to point out the many erotic overtones in the book. As for the story itself, it drags a bit, and though it is genuinely creepy in some parts, the ending is so quick that everything is wrapped up in two pages, with a ""happily ever after""-type ending that has Van Helsing bouncing Mina and Jonathan's child on his knee. However, though the book does have its faults, it is still a classic novel of English literature and should not necessarily be classified as ""horror fiction"" when there is a lot more there to be discussed."
5,it takes a fool to make a war,"""Injutice is as much a part of life as the weather.""These two quotes sum up the book perfectly."
5,Perfect for Horse Lover,Cutest little horse purse -- soft and durable. Little 4 year old loves it and keeps her dollars and coins safely hidden away in the slotted pony -- almost like a secret compartment.
4,A Must Read for Development Studies and Practice,While it might be premature to give full comment on this book because I am yet to read it all up. I must say it is a very good reference book for any Development Studies student or practitioner who is looking to make a sustained difference with development initiatives. This book was recommended by my Professor and Thesis Supervisor. Its an insightful read on participatory approach to development.
3,Good but not up to the Moneypenny's standard,"This one has some good tracks but it is my least favorite of the Miss Moneypenny's compilations. For those who don't know Miss Moneypenny's is a dance club in the UK that is all about funky house and the albums represent this.This one, however, is not as consistent as the others. I find myself skipping over quite a few tracks I don't like during those rare times I choose to put this one in. For the absolute best, far and away top Miss Moneypenny's album, get ""Funky House - the sound of Miss Moneypenny's"" if you can find it. It'll be worth the search. It is the best funky house album I've ever found.Also if you like the sound of the Moneypenny's albums, you might want to check out the album ""DJ Disciple New York City 100% dance volume 2 international house vibes"". It's not exactly the same feel as the Miss Moneypenny's albums, but it's also one of the top house albums with the funky house groove."
4,"Great product, feature / price","Goods:Good Power for big headphonesExcelent battery lifeSmall, compactBads:includded earplugsuser interfase (not very esay to manage inside a pocket)"
3,Somewhat entertaining...,"I bought this tape thinking that I was going to see a lot of Yukari Oshima as a ninja, but she only had about 2 minutes of screen time. I thought the Japanese trio were cool and reminded me of the characters from the ""Wrath of the Ninja"" Anime. Down points were too many characters and a lousy plot. Some of the highlights were some of the comedy, Yukari Oshima's anime-ish ninja outfit, and the cameo character appearance of Wong Fei Hung as a kid."
1,can't wash them,"These pads don't hold up well at all when you wash them. I haven't even used them, but followed the directions to wash before using, and after the first wash, they are now rough to the touch and starting to fray at the edges. It doesn't even feel quilted against my skin, I can't imagine this would be comfortable against a baby's skin. More than a little disappointed in this Carter's product..."
2,Carters pads,"These are too large for the changing table, and the diaper tabs stick to them. Velcro sticks to it also. They are decent at absorbing though..."
2,magic or miracle cloth,not worth time or money---just do not pick up dirt and get lint covered if washed ---love the sponge but not these
4,Great cleaning rags,"Reviewing something as mundane as a cleaning rag may sound strange, but if cleanliness is important to you, then it makes sense. I love these not only because they clean well, but because they dry quickly. I think this is much more sanitary, because a damp cloth breeds bacteria. With a toddler in the house, it's important to me that I can dry and put away my cleaning rags quickly."
3,PRETTY GOOD CD,"Good Points:The songs, of course, are good, they're played well, and Beneke solos as well as ever. Some of the BEST songs are ""East Of The Sun,"" ""Just You, Just Me,"" ""These Foolish Things,"" ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" ""It's So Peaceful In The Country,"" ""Cherokee"" and ""Pennies From Heaven.""Bad Points:Practically all the songs are instrumentals. Tex Beneke sings on only ONE song (""Pennies From Heaven""). And the handbook that comes with it doesn't give ANY recording dates at all--although naturally it's between 1948 to 1950--and is lacking in substance.Verdict:A good, but flawed, CD. It's worth having."
1,not for small busted,"I purchased this in size small, it has huge cups that are definately not for a small busted person. it looks ridiculous."
5,"flows, goes, and blows my mind","very very melodic, the jams are eccentric in a good mellow, fasinating way that captivates you and almost holds you in the music not letting you turn it off or down. the musicianship is superb. i would most deffinantly recommend getting this cd if you are any fan of music at all, you will not be let down i promise. the three in the band know what they are doing and know how they are doing it. you will not get tired of them. the media reviews are not misleading at all latin, jazz, african, cuban, its all there in the music. music lovers beware... you may have just found your new favorite band"
1,2 books,"i have bought 2 books from amazon in the last month, both very exspensive . the nevada record book showed up with the dust cover in very bad shape, rubs from the packaging. the heddon legacy book was over $200.00 and saposed to be brand new, the book was scuffed and had wear . i have a personal collection of books and was not impressed how these books showed up ."
3,A rawking live sound and two previously unreleased tracks.,"The Pumpkins recorded this live, and you can tell. The version of ""Siva"" begins with a spurt of feedback, foreshadowing the intensity of the recording. Also on the disc is ""Girl Named Sandoz,"" later to appear on ""Pisces Iscariot,"" and a soft tune, ""Smiley."" Pick this disc up - it's a must have for Pumpkin fans."
1,Recollections of an Old Man,This book is missing many pages including the ones I need. I see what I want in the index but that part is missing so the book is of no use to me.
3,Very Average.,"This book was a very average read, one that did not capture my attention for very long periods of time. I couldn't wait to get to the end, and not because I was eager to read the crescendo conclusion. It was more because I couldn't wait to get to the end and on to the next book."
3,Too much bad language,I thought it was a very good read except for the bad language. I would have rated it four stars if not for the cursing. I will read no further books by Howard Bahr.
4,"D. McKay, Nashville, TN","Having read the previous two books in this series-- the first The Black Flower which covered the Battle of Franklin, TN and the second The Year of Jubilo which took place right after the end of the Civil War--I wanted to read this third book The Judas Field which featured soldiers returning to the Battle of Franklin location twenty years after the war.The books are well written. Mr Bahr was able to take me into the lives of the simple, plain, everyday characters and very well describe the times in which they lived or died and the issues they dealt with. He is extremely knowledgeable about this battle and the experiences that soldiers had returning to their homes."
5,The Judas Field,"The Judas Field is the most recent of three classic Civil War novels by Howard Bahr, a magnificent writer. He will be recognized soon, I think, as a writer comparable to William Faulkner. Bahr is one of the country'sgreat authors."
3,Dull color and comes off on your finger.,"The price was great, but the screws looked tarnished/oxidized. They are dull gold like the pic or darker and come off on your finger and smell when you handle them. Unlike another batch I bought from them of differnet size, which was golden yellow and didn't come off in hand."
2,What is up with the bigger head?,"I was SO disappointed when I got to see this doll in person! I have been collecting Barbies for a long time and my absolute favorites have always been the holiday dolls. I love this doll's dress, the beaded details are lovely. However, the new oversized head really bothers me! I am not a Bratz/My Scene/etc fan, so when I see ""my Barbies"" being changed in this fashion, I am just disgusted. Her head just looks odd being too large, it cheapens her appearance, plus the facepaint is NOT up to standard for a doll in the $30-$40 price range, it is more like one of the $5 playline dolls. I will NOT be buying this doll..."
1,Big Head Holiday Is All Wrong,"I always buy the holiday Barbie dolls. I will not be buying this one. The head on this doll is too big. I don't like the big head trend. Aren't the My Scene dolls enough? Now Mattle has to put a big head their holiday Barbie?I like the gown on the doll but I can't get past the big head. It ruins the overall look.I realize that Barbie needs to be updated over time, but she should retain the same basic proportions. Barbie dolls come in different body styles these days. It's hard to find clothing that will fit all the dolls.The Sweetsville Kelly dolls with the large heads (often called ""lemonheads"" by collectors) seem to have been a huge failure. Didn't Mattel learn from that? The big heads are unnecessary and do not make Barbie look better.[Written by my wife. :-) ]"
1,Another Holiday Disappointment,"I was so hoping that this Holiday Barbie would be better than the 2003 doll, but alas, it was not to be! I did not purchase the 2003 doll because her narrow, elongated eyes were just downright scary! This was the first time that I had not bought the Holiday doll since 1988.When I saw the 2004 doll in the store, I knew that I would not be purchasing her either! Her head is too big and her face looks like a hooker's. I did give her one star for the gown. I would buy the gown if I could get it without the doll, which ruins the overall effect. She looks like one of those $5 Barbie lookalikes that are sold in convenience stores.I know that these big headed dolls are popular with the kids, but I hope that Mattel will consider the likes of collectors as well. After the outstanding Holiday Barbie of 2002, these last two years have been a big letdown!Note: I have not seen the African American version in person. I am wondering if this doll looks better?"
2,TERRIBLE PIECE OF JUNK!!!!! UGH!!!,I did NOT buy this doll. I saw her in a toy store and i was SO disappointed with the way she looked. Her face paint was that of a ten dollar doll with nothing out of the ordinary like the regular holiday dolls. The dress was nice but not up to collector status. Sorry. Besides her obvious huge head her eyes are big and bugged. Come on Mattel. You could of did better than this?
3,bad eyes,"I am a collector too, My first impression was that this is the hooker holiday barbie. Her eyes and makeup is like a hookers. I am only buying it because I have the collection."
2,Big Head,I agree with the other reviewers....her head is too big and she looks out of proportion. I try to get the holiday Barbie each year and bought her for that reason. She is not pretty at all. I sure hope next year they go back to her beautiful traditional look. Her head looks like those awful Bratz dolls....Yuk.
4,A wonderful gift,I mentioned that I liked dolls to a new friend and when he saw her he had to buy her. She is the quintesential barbie. I would have preferred her in the black version but thats just me. Her beading and glitzy glamour is exquisite. I am so proud to own her!
1,barbie poo poo,This toy wasn't worth the money. The head fell of the 3rd day i had it. My baby sister threw it against the wall very lightly and 2 arms and a leg came off. If you want a good doll dont even think of buying this peice of junk!!
2,not the real thing,I was not pleased with what I ordered. I should have know that I could not get the real L'eau D'issey by Issey Miyake at this price of 39.99. Its more alcohol than anything. Not the same smell as the ones in Macy's.
4,It's not your grandma's floral,"Don't get me wrong. I love my Diorissimo and Parisienne, but nothing--nothing--draws compliments like this one. Its just-out-of-the-shower, lemonyL'eau D'issey By Issey Miyake For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ouncesscent will raise the well-being level of everyone it comes into contact with."
2,NOT the real L'eau D'issey,Came in a completely different type of bottle first of all. The scent smells very similar but I can barely even smell it after it's sprayed and does not last at all. Definitely not the same/real one from the store. I wouldn't waste my money on this.
5,"Great Scent, Great Price","I love this scent. It's light and not overpowering. I've worn it for several years, and seldom wear anything else. I bought it through Amazon because the price was much better than I had found anywhere else."
2,presentacion no es la misma,"el mismo se adquirió bajo la descripción de 3.4 OZ y el entregado fue de 3.3 OZ, por el resto la entrega fue segun lo pautado."
2,Not very happy,"I buy a Eau du Toilette, but i got Natural Spray, so i wasn't real Perfum. In 2 hours the Aroma just go away.I pay lots of money for a natural spray. :("
1,Did not come in a box,Came wrapped in bubble wrap! It was a gift for my step mother and this was very embarrassing. Not even a gift wrapping was an option.
5,Great roll on,This fragrance is one of the best I have ever had. I am so happy that it comes in roll on as I am unable to use sprays. I intend to purchase another bottle soon.
4,"Not a history, a broad brush overview of the Greek world","After reading Gates of Fire, I wanted to delve into classical Greek culture. This book is a great intro to Greece from Homer to Alexander. The book covers the history, culture, philosophy, arts, and ""mind"" of the ancient Greek - all in about 250 pages. It does a marvelous job of introducing the reader to the subject. It would be difficult to read this book and not be astonished by what this civilization accomplished. My only complaint is a nit: the author includes many references to 1950's England that I did not understand."
3,Kitto and the Greeks,"""The Greeks"" by Kitto is not a book that would normally appear even close to the top of anyone's reading list, unless you enjoy ancient history. What is a Hellene? Kitto explains it. What does the word polis come from? Kitto explains it. What is the Spartan ideal? Kitto explains it. It can be a dry book at times, but reading it carefully you will learn a lot about Greek culture. You will learn who were the Greeks, the Greek government systems, the Athens, the Spartans, and a polis. I suggest this book if you read or study about ancient Greece. I suggest reading pages seven to ninety-five."
4,a very good introduction.,This book is a good source for an introductory glimpse of the 'Greek context'. Possibly not the best book for classics students because many statements are made without reference to sources of information. Kitto keeps the pace going fast enough to maintain interest in those not so versed in this area.
3,The Greeks for Kindle: Typos!,I am enjoying this book but what's the deal with so many freaking typos!? Was this an error in transferring the content into Kindle format or is the original filled with these exact typos?
2,out of date,"Though a required text for my Master's course had I been the professor I would have shelved this as out of date and not relevent. Not only does it not mention recent findings, it is too old. Mr. Kitto had been dated 9 years before the third publication. while interesting to read, I would not have chosen it. As a result I ordered a much more recent book and one that is relevent to the 21st century and it's discoveries. If I were a professor I would advise collegues to suggest it but not require it."
3,Good Intro to the Greek Life,A good intro to the world of the greeks. It's a little bit hard to understand but it does give helpful comments about The Histories of Herodotus and Homer's Illiad.
1,Don't buy this.,"The only reason you should buy this is if you want to wear it for one day. I was wearing this for signifigantly less than a week when I realized the inside of the ""rose"" was gone. I didn't care that much because it was cheap, but still, it's not worth ordering unless you realize it'll be good for one wearing and don't mind."
3,A Step In The Right Direction,"After dissapointing sales of 'Invincible' (One More Chance was a track recorded for that album) Jackson's attempt to show everyone how good his songs are, 'Number Ones' may be, allegations aside hopefully is a stepping stone to a new Michael Jackson with fresh material set to put the embarrassment that was 'Invincible' an 'album between albums' and nothing more.The new single from the eccentric super star may not break new ground like alot of his past efforts but it is a good, not great song with a pleasant, catchy chorus. It won't be a huge seller but will tell his fans that the King Of Pop still has a lot left in him."
1,the worst R. Kelly has written for MJ,"I think that this song is not bad, but it is not good either. It is weak lyrically and musically and I don't think it's worthy of MJ. The thing I liked about Cry and You Are Not Alone is that they didn't sound like R. Kelly songs, they sounded like MJ songs. One More Chance sounds like an R. Kelly song that he should have put on his own album, not an MJ album. I think the only reason he released it along with number ones is to get out of his recording contract with sony. I have this single and number ones, but only cause I am a die hard. They still aren't mj worthy, but I always support MJ. Michael we love you and know you are innocent! :) Work more with Babyface, not R. Kelly :)"
4,Releasing his voice at last!,"Despite all the hoopla around his private life, I am still giving Jackson a chance with his music. Finally, he has created real music that gives justice to his roots as a soul musician. Not since the 'Bad' album had I heard real music in his voice. Here's hoping that his so-called music that followed in the 90's was (hopefully) a trial period with techno noise, self-growth, and self-therapy. This time, he has created music that is simple, his voice has opened up to how he used to sing freely, and the lyrics are clear. I give him 4 out of 5 for this single!"
5,A very informative magazine for the novitiate and the knowledgeable.,"My partner and I led a small group on a cruise (my first; he's a travel agent.) We had subscribed to Cruise Travel for several years and I had always enjoyed looking them over, and then getting to see the ships either in port or getting to do a travel agent tour. On our cruise, unknown to us at the time, were reviewers from Cruise Travel, so we had a nice surprise with the next issue when we got home. They were very thorough and honest and the accompanying pictures were great. I highly recommend the magazine both for an informative review in words and pictures of cruise ships and the ports they visit."
1,Magazine purchases via Amazon,I would not recommend the purchase of a magazine subscription from Amazon since it takes twice the time to receive your first issue. Becasue of that I have not received an issue to review it properly yet. I will purchase all subscriptions direct from the publisher especially if its the same price as this was.
5,A Gift of Pure Goodness!,"This calendar should be on every wall in America. It is as pure a philanthropy play as you will find. It honors 12 celebrities who really get it---having donated at least $1 million to charity, AND 100% of the proceeds from the sale of the calendar go to charity!! You get a beautiful and functional gift and you help 12 charities at once! What could be better? I cannot wait to see who is in next year's calendar."
3,Okay performances but way overpriced,"If you want these two works, they are available at much lower prices. These two performances are only okay. There is nothing special about them and the sound is somewhat dated. It is amazing how many MP3 downloads are overpriced. Be careful."
3,Some Wrong Doings in Paradise,"First in the Vineyard Murder series. The editing was a bit choppy, but I think I will most definately give book 2 a try.During his career as a Boston cop, Jeff ""JW"" Jackson was shot and has decided to retire to the serenity of Martha's Vineyard to spend his days fishing and wooing a nurse named Zee. But when a local's boat mysteriously explodes off the coast, killing a young man, Jackson finds himself reluctantly drawn back into the investigative trade.There are some wrong doings in paradise - and it's contaminating Jackson's lovely peaceful island with its poisonous venom of drugs and death."
2,You've got to be kidding me,"The second line in the first chapter sums up the originality, creativity and quality of the writing in this book:""Outside it was as black as a tax collector's heart.""Yes...that trite, that tired, that unoriginal."
5,TheWhole Brain Game,"I ordered this game because my family loves to play board games on Holidays, weekends, or whenever we can get together.The age range when we played was 9 to 67, and we all found it thought provoking and fun.I would recommend this game for families."
1,Travel 50 & Beyond Subscription - bad deal,I have never received a copy of this magazine that I ordered in August of last year! They didn't hesitate to take my money though! I have no idea if the magazine has any redeemable articles in it at all.
2,Single travelers poorly represented,"I am an older single woman. I love to travel by myself or with friends. Recently, I subscribed to Travel 50 & Beyond.I counted photographs of thirty couples in a recent issue and NONE of single travellers enjoying themselves. According to the American Association of Single People, almost 50% of the adult population of the US is unpartnered. The travel industry and its publications need to catch up with the demographics! I will not continue to subscribe to this or any other magazine that does not give equal representation to the travel interests of the single population. Wake up to reality!"
1,"Ugly to watch, musically interesting, I'll give it away if you'll take it","I bought this because it looked interesing. Very strange, definitely low budget production. Hard to get past Das Rhinegold. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone to watch. Listening is quite nice. The sound is great. Some singers have a very annoying wide vibrato. Wagner is probably turning in his grave, more like spinning."
2,"Buy it to listen, but forget the production.","I rarely write brief reviews, but this release deserves nothing more. Aurally, it is quite good, without being exceptional. Catherine Foster brings a fine Brunnhilde, and Johnny van Hal a good Siegfried, amongst a cast that, vocally is quite good. Orchestra and chorus also sound well, with the conductor, Carl St. Clair, showing a good grasp of the work.But at this point, they seem to have exhausted their funds. The sets generally appear to have been made by an amateur company, and one is left to wonder if there was a director present at all stages there are so many places where the cast seem to move aimlessly, unsure of where they are supposed to go. The conclusion of Gotterdammerung must represent the worst staging ever presented. Nothing happens.Technically, the sound (PCM Stereo and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1) is fine and the 16:9 1080i image reasonable.In summary: musically quite good, but in no way outstanding; visually, a disaster."
5,A Very Nice Collection of Material!,"I loved this book! It has material for every fan of the famous TV special, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". I may not be musical, but if you are, this book includes the music. I am fond of the discussions of the people involved in creating the production of the TV show and the script. I will be using the script in my classroom for Reader's Theatre. The book has a lot of material that has meaning for me personally. I was young when this special was shown on television and it was always one of my favorites. The book was not a disappointment to read and own. I am very glad I bought it."
3,Somewhat useful,the history of the movie was very interesting. Enjoyed the info about the the making of the movie. Needed it for the scripts for a Christmas play. It served its purpose. Had a few mistakes.
3,One of TV&#65533;s worthwhile traditions-Revisited,"Lee Mendelson , one of the men behind all of the Peanuts cartoons, has created a tribute book for one of the most watched and appreciated Christmas specials. Inside you'll find the history of the cartoon, from its humble beginnings as an idea put forth by Coca-Cola looking for a Christmas special, to the inspired use of Vince Guaraldi's wonderful jazz, and the casting of ""real"" children as the voices, A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS proved to be a series of fortuitous events. This is an enjoyable keepsake for fans of the show, but there is some obvious padding, I mean, 90 pages of illustrated script? The book is only 192 pages long. There are other extras, like the production sheets and Melendez's original backgrounds. They are welcome sights and it would have been nice to see more effort put into details like these. That being said I enjoyed the book, but would only recommend it if you get a break on the retail price."
5,A classic for fans both young and old,"You don't need to have grown up with Charlie Brown to appreciate this, but of course this will bring back lots of great memories if you did. The book includes reminiscences about Charles Schulz and also lots of glimpses into the creative process (artwork sketches, animation cells, sheet music).Probably 40 percent of the book (essentially the second half) is the illustrated script for ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" in its entirety.Paperback, but thick and almost coffee table book quality."
5,It's a great read!,"I lent this book to a non-Catholic neighbor of mine and she is extremely serious about homeschooling now, thanks to this book (and she is only half way through). I think that it is by far the best Catholic homeschooling book out there, if for no other reason than the fact that it is a collection of so many people and gives the reader a taste of everything."
4,As usual,"Like all Tiffen filters, this is a quality product. The one drawback--a serious one--is that I can't use it as is with any other filter on my EOS."
3,Filter Cannot Take Lens Cap,"I am concerned that the ""wide angle"" filter does not have the ability to put a lens cap on the polarizer.If shooting outside, it helps to put on the lens cap without having to take the polarizer off!"
1,Disappointed in product!!!,I tried this hose and it is not for anyone who plans to use it often. The ends are very cheap plastic and easily strip if you take the hose off and on the faucet constantly (manufacturer does not recommend leaving it attached to faucet if not using). It does not roll up as easily as portrayed on tv and is easily punctured and cannot be repaired.
1,beware of mistake,"Beware of mistake! I have ordered this product twice , but received an odd replacement. Same title but different lable: inferiour material back from the early 60-ties, a 20 min. stand still hazy picture presentation.I received refund, but still want to have the original I once ordered."
2,Douglas or Jack or Joy...,"Whomever the book is about... The title clearly indicates, but does tend to make most think it is primarily about Lewis and Joy. At any rate, it comes across as readable but dry. It seems to be about a boy lost in a confusing life filled with loss who then seeks desperately for his own worth. Sadly he seems to find his worth mostly in who his mother and stepfather were. If that is the sort of story you seek, then this is your book."
4,Douglas G.,What an unusual childhood Douglas had living with 2 geniuses. I wish he had spoken more about his brother David.
2,Cashing in on his step-father's fame,"This is the autobiography of Douglas Gresham, stepson of C. S. Lewis. Gresham was eight years old when his mother took him and his brother to England to meet the writer; in time, she and Lewis married. Gresham's mother died when he was fifteen and Lewis died three years later.The subtitle of this book - ""My childhood with Joy Davidman and C. S. Lewis"" - is misleading, because he has little to say about them. Gresham was away at school throughout their marriage and his descriptions of Lewis are vague, indicating he didn't know him well. The book should have ended with Jack's death, but goes on at length about Gresham's adult life which was uneventful. Fans of C. S. Lewis who hope to gain insight into the man will be disappointed."
3,"IT'S JUST AN EP,AND NOWHERE NEAR AS PERFECT AS ""LOVE 15"".","Only an ep.Don't be fooled.It's ok for a completist,but not necessary.IT IS NOT A PROPER FOLLOW UP TO ""LOVE 15""."
5,Mission Octagon,"Amazing insight into the Vietnam War. Fundamental struggle between ""taking the easy road"" and what is the ""right"" thing to do. A childs admiration of a parent-to rebellion-to ultimately gaining the respect from the parent. Just a few of life's lessons portrayed in Mr.Smith's expertly woven thriller, Mission Octagon. A must read!"
5,Mission Octagon,"A novel of suspense and intrigue wrapped in a moralistic enigma with realistic insights into Vietnam and government espionage. An obsessive quest to do the right thing, not just what's right and in so doing, expose the secret of Mission Octagon.A can't put down thriller and great read from beginning to end. If you guess the secret before it's revealed ... you'll be the first.... If you read one novel this year, make it Mission Octagon ..."
5,Great action packed novel,"The author writes as if you are there, right in the middle of the action, and there is plenty of action. Kept me on the edge of my seat (figure of speech). It brought back memories good and bad of the Vietnam war.Highly recommended for those that like action and intrigue."
5,Please note Revised November 2001 edition available,This best selling book was completely rewritten and updated in November 2001.
3,Shallow pans,The largest pan is huge and I couldn't even find a cake sheet that it could fit on. Needless to say I used the 2 smaller pans but they were very shallow and made very thin cakes. I would have rather gotten 2 pans and had them be a little thicker. You almost have to make a 2 layer cake for each one in order to make it look presentable. If I had known this I would not have bought these specific pans.
4,happy with this set of pans,i ordered this trio for my neice's wedding cake. she wanted a square wedding cake. i looked around in our local stores and this set was almost $15.00 less. the delivery was very prompt . the quality is very good.
2,Okay.....,The Small and medium were ok....but the large did not season at all. Everything I did in it Stuck no matter what I used
3,Not sharp corners,"I was looking for square pans with sharp corners. These have all rounded corners for fondant, which I was not using. I had to return the pans."
1,Don't bother,"This thing is a joke. It's barely tall enough for the cat to get into it. Would you want to have to sit under a contraption that looks like a 1800's Conestoga wagon when YOU use the bathroom? Your cat won't either. It's bad enough when you try to change the cat's litterbox. But you're asking for trouble putting this poorly designed contraption on it. What's even worse it trying to wrestle with removing and reinstalling it should you need to do anything to the box. It's bad enough the top half of the ""Mega Elite"" doesn't firmly attach to the base. But the little poles on this cover tend to get stuck in their mounting holes and pull up the base when you try to remove the cover. So then you're faced with the hassle of putting the top back into place before you can reinstall the cover.Basically it seems like a good idea but in practical it's a huge pain in the, well... just avoid it."
2,Missing part,It came missing a part but we were able to use a coat hanger instead. Then my cats tried to sit on top of it and broke it. I would recommend hard tops and not cloth. It didn't last 24 hours.
1,Littermaid Tent,"This product is definitely NOT worth the money I spent for it. The concept is great, however, the tent does not stay up. The least little pressure against it and it pops out of the holes and collapses. There should be a better way to attach this product."
1,waste of money!!,"It is really short, flimsy and cheaply made. I have a ragdoll cat and he hated it. He barely fit under it. I guess if you have a really small cat it would be ok. But I don't recommend it at all."
4,Very enjoyable read,"I really enjoyed reading this western novel. The story is told from the perspective of a young impressionable cowboy, who is thrust into a great adventure. It just goes to show that there are many good old novels just waiting to be republished as e-books."
5,Not just for kids !!,"Although this book is recommended for children, I think any age will enjoy it. I was about 5 when they launched Sputnik. So I grew up with my eyes on the stars and all the science fiction I could read. No cowboys for me!I still like science, fact and fiction. But as I got older I found myself being drawn to tales of the West. This book is one of the many reasons I still get drawn back."
2,The cowboy and the Cossack Poor writing especially the dialogue. Events just too far out to be believable. Didn't finish book,The Cowboy and Cossack.Poor writing especially the dialogue. Events are just too far out to be believable. Didn't get past the first few chapters.
4,More than just a western story,"There are lessons relevant to today in this story. I'm thinking about the comparison of chess to real war. I finished the book weeks ago, but I still think of things that it taught me."
4,Fun cowboy book,This book was exactly what I needed: a nightly escape from legislative session. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it. The characters will stick with you.
4,Cowboy and Cossack,A basically good read but it slowed down at times in the details. The charater development was very good and gave the reader a good insight into their abilities and motoivation.
3,Not what I thought I remembered.,"I ordered this when it was first announced and eagerly awaited the release. I was disappointed.I read this novel back in the 70s and thought I remembered it well. I must have been enamored with the F words way back in my youth. As another reviewer of the book has indicated, the only thing Mr. Huffaker apparently knew about cattle drives and the ""Cowboy Code"" must have come from a movie script. Anyone who has ever actually handled livestock would know better.If you can find a copy, I would recommend Sam Brown's book ""The Long Drift"" as a better description of the cowboy way of life."
4,The Cowboy and the Cossack,After just about giving up on finding a decent book to read I foundThe Cowboy and the Cossack .To read about two strong men and invisiioning such men and their lives waswell worth having a Kindle.I am looking for books equal to The Cowboy and the Cossack.
5,I echo all of the reviews - this is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read,This is a book I have read several times starting about 30 years ago. I have purchased several of these books - 2 for myself -others as gifts. I always keep a book for my shelf and one as a loner in the case it is not returned. I never loan out my last book. The camaraderie and respect among the cowboys is inspiring. The crossing of cultural barriers is an incredible story of tolerance and understanding in the truest sense.
5,Gift for a friend,This book was unavailable in the stores and/or libraries herein Tucson. What a find. Great service and product. Recommend this site for future purchases.
1,I Returned It,"I'm somewhat surprised I'm in a position of writing a negative review. But after reading about a 1/3 of the book, I asked for a refund. I spent a lot of time as a youth on a working cattle ranch. It's obvious from the 1st chapter, the writer knows nothing about cattle or cattle drives. I was turned off by page after page of ""colorful metaphors"" as Spock would put it. I'll leave it at that."
4,cowboy bravado in old russia,Huffaker is a good story teller and entertainer. I bought this book based on reviews and a recommendation in the introduction to another book. Classic western themes of hard men in a hard land---whether cowboy or cossack---and the honor of the brotherhood. A good read.
5,My favorite book of all time,"I'm so glad to see others have enjoyed this book as much as I have. I first read it as a teenager but have read it a few times again---it is that good. I am an avid reader and have read quite a bit in several genres and I say without hesitation that this is my favorite book of all time. I highly recommend it to everyone. I noticed some comments on a few posts about a possible movie or film...I have mixed feelings about this. While I would love for others to experience this story, the movie would have to be very well done to capture the essence of this very fine work."
5,"Excellent study of human nature, hilarious and moving","I first read this book as a teenager. To this day (22 years later) it remains my all-time favorite. The story presents some of the richest characterizations of human beings to be found in written word. It combines the best of adventure, history, humor, sorrow, friendship, fraility, and love into a riviting story."
2,Fuzzy Venus.,"Some have compared this release with Fuzzy Logic and this was, for them, a good thing. After buying Phantom Power and Rings Around The World I found Fuzzy Logic to be bland and generic.Hey Venus is better than Fuzzy Logic in that it contains two songs that I enjoy rather than none. Most of the tracks are repetitive and lacking in the sparks that made the last SFA albums so good.Perhaps Gruff Rhys' solo effort, Candylion, took away some of the songs that would have ended up here. Perhaps they decided to lay off the weed for a while. Whatever happened, Hey Venus is a step backwards for such a talented band."
4,Don't care for the album cover but the music is solid,"""Run-Away"", ""Neo Consumer"", & ""Baby Ate My Eightball"" are among my favorites. Not a dud on on the album."
3,Not the best,"I've been for a while trying to figure out what I make of this album. Although good, it's definately not their best. This album was supposed to throw the band in a new direction, while it does for the most part, I find that it has a more radio-friendly than a ""super furry"" sound to it. In short, sometimes I enjoy it, sometimes I don't. An average album at best, I'd recommend Phantom Power or Guerilla to a newcomer."
1,Depressing & Disturbing,"This story begins with a scenario involving the sex trade in gold rush San Francisco. Ms. Coulter goes into great detail over the heroine's experiences at the hands of her captor. What I found distasteful in the extreme was the ongoing sordid sexual perversity between Dr. Saint Morris and young Juliana, the girl he rescued. Very needlessly dark and disturbing. Not Recommended."
3,Common sense...,"Okay this is more like it. This book is still not the best I've seen from Ms. Coulter but I will take it. Saint and Julianna(Jules), made sense. I can still tell that this is an earlier work for Ms. Coulter but this book was interesting because you knew and understood why they behaved as they did. I liked parts of it, they're mutual fears, and I kinda of liked other parts, the back ground of the other couples from other books. This book I'd recommend. Still a devoted fan, but I wish she could stay grounded in historicals instead of present day drama/suspense, but i'm sure i'm not the first to say so. Oh well, Ms. Coulter keep them comin'."
3,Worh a try,"I'm a big fan of her's and like her books. This one was pretty good. Not one of her best, but definately worth reading."
2,Not For Me,"This scent is overpowering to me, and gives me a migraine headache.I realize that everyones' body chemistry is different, but I have to say this is one of the worst scents--at least for me-I have ever bought."
3,I have questions,I am still waiting for one shipment to arrive.I ordered on March 15. Three books from one supplier never arrived. I have not heard anything. I guess I have to track them down.
2,rambling,"I'm not sure if it's the translation from book to Kindle, or the writing itself, but all I can say about this book is that it rambled on and on. It felt disjointed and did not flow at all. Not a fan."
2,Need a serious nap,"after finally finishing this thing. The. Well. author William went into the, rather Bill. Was I speaking of this? Book on wings of moths when writing. Had laid his hand on. I have to say it is a very heavy as the snow that falls from the glossy heavens above read. Nat was great in college lit but no more. Oh Lordy, no."
1,It was very boring and hard to understand,"What is the deal with this new modernist style of writing. Everything is so ambiguous, and the plotline is very vague. I like real classics, not this modernist trash. This book was awful."
4,Tortured lives,"William Styron's first novel is often overlooked because ""Sophie's Choice"" is, without doubt, his flagship; however, his style in ""Lie Down in Darkness"" is as melancholy and forceful as it was in each of his subsequent novels. No reader can leave these pages unmoved by the depth of suffering, both self-imposed and due to other forces, of its principal characters. The family unit is rife with undercurrents and has no opportunity to become functional because the parents are so deeply enthralled with their own problems. I disliked Helen the most. Her passive aggressive martyrdom fueled her husband's neuroses and alcoholism until their relationship became Faulknerian in its dysfunction. Styron's well-known bouts of depression obviously inspired much of the insights into mental illness. The pain of these characters is palpable throughout the book, and I find myself thinking about this family more than I would like."
5,The way nursing was meant to be,I am finding this book both enlightening and confirming of my own practice. Why didn't I find it sooner?
3,Fun but hard to control,"This toy fulfills its purpose of scaring the dog. The toy is extremely durable and long lasting, the battery life is average and the controls are extremely hard to get used to. I find it very hard to turn because it just flips over and spins while trying to turn. If you want a decent cheap remote controlled car this might be the one."
