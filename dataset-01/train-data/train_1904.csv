2,Prine Tamed,"I am a huge Prine fan, but in my opinion this is one of the few poor albums he has made. Prine seems uninspired on all of the tracks here and there are few great songs on this album. I think that this is one of his few recordings where the material is actually overproduced and Prine one of the great songwriters of all time has his charm taken away."
2,No Sense...,"After discovering the self-titled John Prine album about 12 months ago, I have been purchasing and listening to his Albums in the order that they were released. I have been able to get a whole year of listening out of his first three albums (the self titled, Diamonds in the Rough, and Sweet Revenge). But unlike his first three albums, which rewards you by repeated listening, the so-called ""Common Sense"" album just seems to repulse me more and more. I love John Prine's music, and will certainly continue to make my way through his canon...but this album is definitely not the caliber of his first three....it's no wonder I found it for $4.95 in a discount CD bin at a record store."
5,Great item!,"It's a great charger for the price, no complaints.Eforcity Audio Stereo Link Y Cable for Apple iPod, iPod (video), iPod nano, iPod phote and iPod mini playersEforcity Premium Retractable Apple iPod to Firewire/1394 Cable, White {Compatible with: iPods w/dock connector only [including iPod mini / Pod 3G/4G / iPod U2 / iPod Photo etc.}It doesn't feel cheap for me and works with my iPod mini, nano and iPod video"
3,Adequate,"It wasn't very clear to me from the write up, but these are actually quite small. They match the size of the kitchen set that my kids seemed to have grown out of. I was hoping that this would be a stepping stone to keep them from playing with my actual pots and pans (which they really enjoy). Their pretend cooking is enjoyable to watch, but this set hasn't kept them from trying to get to the real cookware - my actual goal. I will have to keep looking for full-size but fake cookware for the kids to play with. At ages 2, 4, 5, and 9, my kids are simply too big for this set."
3,Better out there,"The features on this alarm clock were good. However, after about a year or so the back light became to dim to see the time at night unless you were really close. Currently it does not have a back light and I am just going to throw it out, as I usually do not need to look at the clock when I am not in bed."
2,Timex: The one that keeps on ticking?,"Thank goodness this clock has been discontinued. What a piece of junk. While the unit is physically sturdy, the display is small and awfully hard to read. The display light is inefficient at letting you read the black digits. The buttons on my clock became hard to use; they started to require more and more pressure to make them work until I have to brace the clock on the bed....jamming my fingers on the buttons. I'm ready for a new one!"
1,wrong fit,"I ordered these for my chevy suburban K1500, they came very promptly and I fitted them, bit tight but didn't think much of it being they were ceramic. Had a rubbing sound for ages that I put down to the new ceramics, turns out the metal shim parts of the pads were a lot deeper than the correct parts, they were rubbing on the rotors and created a deep groove in it which in turns meant they were jamming on it and not working correctly. Partly my fault for not realizing they were wrong and partly the seller's for not knowing. I had to replace both my rotors and pads for new due to the damage, expensive lesson to be learned and I have worked on cars all my life. Bought them June 13th and replaced them on August 6th so not a very good life span. But this is only due to the incorrect sizing, the pads themselves would probably have been good so cannot comment on that part."
2,Boring and Complicated,"The reviews make this sounds like it's a book for average chess players, but it's not. It just goes move-by-move through a bunch of games."
3,cd,There are songs I love and songs I do not care for. I wish I had listened to all the cds and just downloaded the few songs I wanted because I do love their sound just not all their songs.
3,it's ok,"This product really doesn't have that many words in it. The games are kind of fun, but it doesn't actually teach you the language......just a few words. Mostly it's just matching the picture they associate the word with, with the word. If you want to learn a few words its useful, but for learning the language, it's bad."
3,"Lots of fun, not a lot of content","I really enjoyed this program. Problem is, after a few days I had completed the program and still couldn't construct a simple sentence, only repeat a phrase learned by rote memory. The vocabulary was a mystery, too. Why did they teach me the word for ""chopsticks"", and not the word for table? I have been searching for an intermediate course, but without much success.I wish this company produced a more comprehensive course."
4,Imperfect design,"Due to confusion, I thought this was a new Era cd but it turns out ""Era"" is the name of the album by the duo In the Nursery. The music is a bit dreary and monotonous. Still I wasn't ready to give up on the cd just yet. After a few more listens, the music eventually began to grow on me. There is a dark, ambient influence, almost a more sinister sound especially on ""Silent in Time"". I wasn't really too fond of that particular track especially the vocals by Klive Humberstone. Sarah Jay Hawley who has worked with Massive Attack in the past contributes to a few tracks on the album. Her fragile vocals complements the sparse electronic melodies especially on ""Tempered Wings"". I really love her whispery vocals on the sumptuous orchestral track ""Vantage"". ""Era"" is a good cd but there is nothing here that I haven't already heard before in ambient music. Another thing I didn't care much for this cd was that I could not upload it on to my itunes library for the library."
5,It works,"Not a lot to say here--I used Krud Kutter on a very rusted cast iron and steel woodworking vise, and it worked as promised. Applying it was a little tricky with the spray bottle, but it dissolved the rust, which was extensive although not very deep, with ten minutes or so. I scrubbed with a stainless steel brush, but I'm not sure that was necessary. I rinsed the Krud Kutter off with water. I also used it on a rusted screwdriver, and it was effective there too. The surfaces still had some black spotting, but the rust was gone."
3,"Convenient, good output, but deficient","It is easy to use and produces good output but it has one fault that may be a deal killer for some. It does not recognize SD cards of over 1 GB. I thought it was DOA when it wouldn't recognize my SD card, so I called Tech Support. They said that that's just the way it is. This ""feature"" wasn't mentioned in any reviews or writeups. Who wants to limit themselves to 1 GB cards anymore? I won't return it because who knows what undocumented ""features"" the competition has - but I'm not real happy!"
4,Single-purpose machine good for 1st-time parents,Bought this for my son and daughter-in-law who are snap-happy (of course!) with their first baby. This printer does a better job producing prints for scrap-booking and card-making than their general-purpose ink-jet printer.
2,"Good quality, not so good software or sheet feeder","Was truly impressed by the quality of the pictures. Was less impresed by the software in the printer to manage pictures and print - a bit confusing and slow. The ultimate disappointment was seeing how at times the paper gets jammed, which makes you lose precious ink and paper... Altogether I don't think I would recommend it..."
5,Epson PictureMate Snap 4x6 Photo Printer,Epson PictureMate Snap 4x6 Photo Printer is a great little printer that produces very nice quality photos. It is easy to use and very easy to take with you when you are on the road.
5,Great Printer!,"I recently used my PMSnap to create 3 scrapbooks for Mother's Day. It was so nice to have a printer with such bright and sharp pictures. And I loved the options with this printer. I could print wallets or index cards, with borders or zoom in. It was wonderful to be able to have your own photo lab in your own home."
5,Wife loves it!,My wife is not very technologically inclined and always complained when it came to printing pictures from our digital cameras. I basically had to do it for her as she had hard time pulling the photos from the cameras to print them out from our pc. SOLUTION! I bought her a picturemate snap and now she can print photos easily on her own with impressive results! This is a great portable printer! I would highly recommend it both for ease of use and print results.
5,Great printer,"This is a great printer. I had some pictures developed at my local camera shop and paid 79 cents a print to get it printed right away. Then I went home and printed the same pictures off my Snap. I thought the quality was better on my little Snap. It only costs about 25 cents a print on the Snap, plus you can do it at home. Once in a while, you have to clean the heads, but the printer does it all. You just press a few buttons. I am not great with tech stuff, but this is easy to operate. I can see why it's called the Snap. It's really fun to use and I highly recommend it. Epson has come up with a winner. Love this printer!"
2,ok .,"actually i agree wit doctor trance, into your eyes is actually a really bad song.. it's not even trance just bunch weird noises terrible."
5,Hottest album of the summer,This is the hottest club/dance CD I've heard all summer. I'm only on #4 of the 2nd CD and I'm love with it. The NEW best dance hits from around the world. Not some crap from back in '04. This is a MUST HAVE for anyone that wants to get pumped before you get to the club...or if you're having a party this is a great CD to put on and not worry about skipping over a bad track. Thank me later ladies and gents.
4,Very good read,I enjoyed the whole series. Claire is funny and down to earth. Sonterra is sexy and fun to be with. I would recommend the whole series.
5,Don't look now,Loved Don't look now. Full of action. I am a fan of Claire and can't wait to read the next two books in this series.
4,Anna's Boys by Bill Pezza,Nice story about high school best friends and the trials and tribulations they encounter after high school including the Vietnam War. Best friends forever.
1,bad service,I tried to load this thing on four computers and could not get it to work on any one of them.The tech support is a robot that is just about worthless.I hope its just my disk. All the contact info is Europ.
3,"Warm, but not hot.","I used to own this record. It came out after the Nightmares album. It's not as heavy as that one. It's more in the Blues and R & B mode. Love-itus is an exception,it rocks! The rest of the record will grow on you. They do a great take on Curtis Mayfield's Believe In Me. Peter Wolf's vocal shine on this record. Over all rating is 3 1/2 stars."
1,Problematic and Unreliable,"This book is not a biography, but fiction disguised as fact. Ms. Naher makes up large scetions of the book about the Karmapa and his mother without a single word to tell the reader that it is all her imagination. The book is not a reliable resource of information about the Karmapa and contains numerous mistakes about the facts and the situations in which she finds herself. Ms. Naher's real subject is herself, her life and her travels.Further, the structure of the book is confusing with too many stories happening at once,and so there is no clear picture of any one of them. If one is interested in the Karmapa, there are several other books (in alphabetical order, by Mick Brown, Ken Holmes, Michele Martin, and Lea Terhune) that give a much truer picture."
5,A Potter's Workbook,I have been teaching ceramics for over 20 years and have been looking for a book like this one to share with my students. I am also a studio artist and have and will find it an invaluable tool when considering the importance of form while I work. Clary Illian is a fabulous potter. She has a great love of the material and her instincts and knowledge about beauty in functionality in pottery is clear and lovely.
5,Best Book for the 2nd Leg of Your Pottery Journey,"Once you have some skill at basic throwing, this is the book you need! Clary examines aesthetic principles of pottery. If you have wondered aloud just what has happened to your pot as it emerges on the wheel, you can get your answer here. Why does your pot look cumbersome while the person next to you has double the clay and yet their creation is light and airy? If you have pondered the question, you need a course in the matter. There are no colored pictures because the book is about form and not about glazes or other embellishment. No more bowling pin vases for me. I am on to lovelier pots!"
5,Great Book,"An excellent resource for the novice or the professional. Wonderful read, and great pictures."
5,Great transaction,The book arrived in great condition and very quickly. I would definitely use this vendor again.
2,Disappointing if you're looking for arcade version,"If you are looking for the classic arcade game, and just want to play using a mouse, this is not for you. Doesn't work well with mouse. There is an arcade game, along with the 3D version, but the arcade version has a ""slanted screen"" look I disliked. Also, game goes through a long boring intro without the slightest clue on-screen or in the booklet how to skip past it. This might be great for someone really into video games, who has a controller/joystick set up, etc. But I was just looking for a simple arcade version to use my mouse with, and this was a big disappointment."
4,Great Centipede game,"Really liked this game when I found it 10 years ago. Now its one of the only games I play. So happy to find it again that I bought two of them. Only problem is that you need to use the game's lowest resolution setting for maximum trackball movement in the arcade mode which, since I haven't been able to enable in Vista, means playing it with XP. Faster is better, of course. I don't play the adventure mode very much but it is also fun, regardless of resolution or OS. This is the original fun game for a trackball. Good graphics and 3D for old school video. It's also more fun than the official arcade version that I bought and cooler looking. Thx..."
2,Don't buy the sizzle,"Not only does the product only slightly resemble restaurant flavor; it just doesn't appear to be quality product. And folks, DEFINITELY not worth the price."
2,This is not the tea I like in restaurants!,"This tea is ok, it's not bitter but it is so disappointing. I have been searching for a jasmine oolong that I had in a Japanese restaurnat that was so good. This tea is not it. You can't even really smell the jasmine in this tea. The tea I had at the restaurant was a golden color with a slightly sweet taste and aroma of Jasmine. I have bought so many teas trying to find it. The saleslady at the fancy tea shop assured me that this was the tea I have been looking for. NOT! Years ago, I had a manager that came from Japan and she took me to a restaurant which her family and friends frequented and I have not had tea like that since. HELP, I want to enjoy tea like that in my own home."
3,What are you looking for?,We are going to Scotland. I found this title recommended while searching for books to give me knowledge of/history of/a flavor of Scotland. That wasn't the main thrust of this book. What little I learned about the Orkney islands was worked into a mystery story which was a bit contrived. A very light read.
5,unique work,"it's not the best music or spoken voice ever, but the combination in this instance creates something unlike any other music i've heard. it's entrancing more than anything i suppose. sometimes i like to try to focus solely on either the music or the words, and, inevitably, i get lost."
4,"Wonderful Music, Annoying Chatter","I read a professional review of this disk which gave it a 5 star (out of 5)rating. I just can't agree. It simply tries too hard to be oh, so clever and exotic. The voicings are simply annoying and distract from some beautiful, and truely exotic and clever string compositions featuring terrific musicianship. Provided your concentration is able to pierce through the voicing and focus upon the dominate string line(s) of any given segment, you will greatly enhance your listening enjoyment. Just because Juan Munoz is doing the speaking does not automatically entitle this disk to a top rating. Only track nine, featuring some crowd rumblings and such, comes close to working within the concept. Five stars for the string compositions, three for the concept and none for the card slinging b.s. oratory."
1,Junk,It doesn't get much worse than this. The audio quality is similar to sticking your head in a bucket and scraping metal objects around. The tape player ate one of my tapes. The tuner never seemed to work in the AM band... you could go 1/4 the way on the same station/static. To trust this alarm clock in waking you for you future is as smart as tricking yourself into thinking you'll get up 30 minutes after you hear your neighbors car start. Buy this only with a surplus of aspirin...
4,I was impressed,I thought this was a fantastic alarm clock. Although it could have been the gental alarm could be a tad louder. The numbers were large enough to see. Otherwise there is nothing wrong with it.I like the tradtional alarm clock styal. I was more impressed with the quality of this clock better then it's T112 counter part. I would love to see more of these made then the other one witch I could do without.I like haveing three options of bells & not two. This electronic is pretty to look at also.
1,Unique Method to Lose on the Lottery/Lotto,"It's no secret that actually winning a lottery jackpot is a long shot...But anyone who follows this mathematically-flawed method of number selection and partial wheeling is virtually guaranteed to NEVER win a lottery jackpot, just like its author. By selecting your 6 numbers (in a std 6/49 lotto) from some combination of the author's 9 number groups, he claims that you can lower the odds of winning the jackpot from nearly 14 million/1 down to 210/1. Is there really a need to go any further with this?EVERYONE has to pick 6 numbers from a drawing pool of 49 numbers. How you decide to pick your 6 numbers has absolutely NO EFFECT on your odds of winning the jackpot in a random drawing...[...]"
3,What's All The Fuss About?,"I heard rave reviews of Kiehl's lotions on TV, so I bought it. This lotion was no better or worse than any other lotion. It did the job, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it again."
1,"Poor quality - color, lighting almost everything!!!","This camera is not worth a penny. I cant think of anything else to describe it. The color, image and lighting came out blurry and unclear. I would not recommend this item at all. Spend a little extra money on another good quality of polaroid camera. If there were negative ratings, this camera definitely belonged to that range."
2,not so great,If you're in the perfect lighting this camera takes good pictures but most of the pictures I've taken are very blury or the colors are way off.
5,Prine is prime!,"Prime Prine CD - This is a great collection of John Prine's best known songs. If you want to get to know Prine better, this is the CD to choose. If you already are a fan, this is one of those one after another ahhhhhs when another familiar melody plays. As a singer-songwriter of contemporary folk/social issues, he cannot be equaled for sarcasm, wit and the unvarnished truth played out in the words of a story that is presnted as a song."
5,Prine Prime,I had never heard John Prine before and bought the CD based on a recommendation from a friend. I am SO glad to have it. John Prine is definitely the Bob Dylan of his genre. Excellent music and and excellent songwriter.
3,when you cross the line can you ever come back?,"The premise of this novel is interesting and unique. The heroine is a light skinned black woman who is the widow of a white man. A new love, a black man this time walks into her life and shakes it up. Love, race, class and family expectations all SHOULD make for a riveting novel. It doesn't work out that way. The heroine is too weak and pliant for my taste and the romance just didn't ignite. There is too much preaching in this novel as well. I know that the author was trying to make a point but she didn't have to bore me with it. Nice try though."
5,a nice surprise,"i didn't know what to expect, but i enjoyed it a lot. it's simple and sweet, but the characters aren't flat or simplistic. i also wish there were more than 3 episodes...."
3,I received the 4100 when I got this...,"At first I bought this to replace what I thought was a dead router. Soon to find out that by the DSL service guy that it or DSL internet address was mess up. This was the wrong thing anyways, but the DSL service guy gave us a free 4200 speedstream, when he to notice that the one I got from here was a 4100 speedstream."
5,EVERY DETAIL LAID OUT IN PHOTOS,Got this for a teen to learn self defense. I love this becuse it is so great to have each move referenced with a photo. No doubt about tecnique. Would highly recomend.
5,Incredible Information.,"...Woww... the book is full of information on defense and offense of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.i got 3 book of BJJ and this one is my favorite, it clear and detailed in every action.The price is steep but when you read and see the content of how much you will learn from this Book, you will agree with me that is worth the price.Go Buy It,you wont regret it!!!!!!!Nat"
5,Very nice,"I like it a lot. It helped me enormous with my training. New exercises, new insight. It's really helpfull for everyone who wants to learn about MMA."
3,"Dated, But Very Complete","This is one BIG book. Kirik is the owner and operator of arguably the largest MMA forum on the internet. He's also an experienced trainer. Despite not being a Gracie or a Shamrock, he's also an experienced competitor.There's no need to go into a huge amount of detail here. The book is what it is. A collection of techniques that you can use in MMA.The book shows a lot of techniques organised by position. The techniques aren't organised into a game or system, but are simply a catalogue of the basics from all the arts that contribute to the game.It's a bit expensive for what it is, nowadays, with so many good texts on the market. But, if you see it around for a good price, pick it up. You never know what you can dig out of it."
4,EXCITING ACTION,ANOTHER THAI ACTION DVD WITH SOME HUMOR TOSSED IN. A MAFIA GANG FORCES A MARTIAL ARTIST TO STEAL INFO BY KIDNAPPING HIS BROTHER. BIG MISTAKE !!
5,Eye Opening Experience,I am ordering this book for all my relatives. This is the most powerful book I have ever read and it must be shared and discussed.
1,SHOCKED!!,This is not a book about african history. It is a book about why blacks should hate whites. I hope and pray that GOD can help free people from this hate and anger because holding onto this only twists and destroys the true loving and forgiving heart that we should all have for one another.
1,Don't bother getting this,"We had purchased this monitor brandnew at our PX. It seemed to look nice and I thought it would be nice to have a smaller more spacesaving monitor. Well little did I know that a common problem of 15 inch monitors or maybe just this one is, that it has difficulty displaying anything higher then 640x480. As soon as we changed it to 800x600 it would start humming and it had this high pitch noise. Needless to say that is quite useless for internet surfing and any software. We exchanged it for a Compaq FS740 and are very happy now!"
3,"Convenience, good image quality, but limited resolution","I acquired the MV540 from a friend who decided to get another monitor. So far, he and I have not had come across any safety issues, but since I'm used to resolutions higher than 800x600, and this monitor is not able to have a sufficient 1024x768 at a refresh rate of over 60Hz. The monitor's video quality is crisp and the lack of anti-glare makes the image much sharper than competitors'. The speakers sound fine and the power supply is within the monitor, without the unnecessary transformer taking up space. The curve-laden design permits use in a small built-in cabinet, which is improved from the MV520 (previous design).I recommend this monitor due to the image quality, audio quality, and convenience; but with three stars, it's due to the limits of resolution.So far, I'm impressed."
5,Never had problems,I have had this monitor since 2000 and have never had a single problem with it. No humming sounds or smoke coming out and I have changed the resolution quite a few times. I highly recommend this item.
5,A great album for real Still's fans,"As a life long CSNY fan and particularly the work of Steve Stills, this is essential listening. Anyone who has seen Stills live will know that the voice may not be what it was and this album has elements of this in it, but what the hell this is the real Stills and is all the better for it. I bought this CD in the States and I feel like I have found a bit of undiscovered Stills, it's a great price and a really worthwhile addition to your collection."
4,an outstanding showcase,"If you are not a fan of Stephen Stills individually,this recording will not convert you.If you are,however,this compilation of electric and solo acoustic performanceswill bring you many hours of enjoyment.The highlights of this disk are the full band,electric tracks(Wooden Ships,Four Days Gone,and a sort of odd choice tocover Joe Walsh's Rocky Mountain Way)We forget that in addition to being a very talented singer/songwriter that Mr Stills can really wail on that guitar!Here he uses the opportunity that he does not get on theCSN&Y; studio recordings to do extended electric guitar solos,and they are a delight.His singing and his overall performance are in fine form here,and his backup band is his usual crop of the beststudio musicians available at the time.As previously stated--an excellent showcase for an excellentmusician doing what he does best."
2,Cheap,"Yeah, you definitely get what you pay for, but this was ridiculous. Spend the extra money on a different saber because the quality of this is not worth even the relatively small price we paid."
2,Poor quality,My 4year old was really excited to see his new toy but it fell apart in 1 week. My older son has one(different brand) which he has been using for past 3 years . I would not recommend this product.
3,Nice cheap prop,"I was putting together a budget Vader costume and already had a good cape and the talking helmet/chestbox. I wasn't even going to bother with the lightsaber until I saw how cheap this was. When I got it, I was pretty happy to see that the blade is entirely hidden by the hilt (which is an impressive length). The ring is perfect for clipping to a belt (I recommend one of those quick release lanyards you see people put their keys on). Unfortunately, the blade is bent when extended and the light is pretty weak unless it is pitch dark outside. Definitely not something you're going to impress anyone with but a nice last second addition to your costume."
2,lightsaber,"This toy fell apart about 2 seconds after taking out of the packaging. However, it was easily put back together and with a little super glue it should be o.k. for a while. My child enjoys playing with but was disappointed at the fact that it broke so soon."
1,Worst Lightsaber I Ever Bought,"I have bought many lightsabers over the years for my sons. I should have known better because this seemed a little pricey plus I don't trust buying from individuals on Amazon. But, my son had picked this one out for some reason so I bought it.Shipping costs were WAY too much.When we got the thing, it didn't look very impressive at all. After a few whacks against another lightsaber, this one actually broke in-two.A big disappointment."
4,OK basic costume,"Bought this for my husband, a huge SW fan. Costume was fun for trick-or-treating with kids. He couldn't see very well thru mask, had to take it off to walk around neighborhood. Also gloves not included and need a black turtleneck or scarf so your neck doesn't show."
2,Looks Good... But That's About It,"The lightsaber looks great in the package. But upon opening, you'll discover that in order to install batteries, you to have unscrew the hilt. Unfortunately, the screw in ours was in there so tight that it refused to budge. We ended up stripping it. We looked for clues on the internet to see how to possibly unscrew a stuck screw but nothing worked. So we have a lightsaber that won't light up.Very, very disappointed."
2,So cheap!,You get what you paid for. I wanted a couple of light sabers to duel with so I ordered two. I was disappointed with their cheapness but for $10 I can't expect it to be too sturdy. My husband ended up getting me a couple of new sabers that were 3 times as expensive but are so much better. Now I'm not too worried about dueling with these and having them break but don't order this if you're wanting a durable product. You might as well shell out the money for a better product.
3,"Bought 2, One broke immediately",We bought two of these for our 4 year old's birthday. One of them broke immediately and it wasn't my son's fault. He was really happy with the one that worked.
1,Cheap,"It broke the first day my son used it. My husband did not only had to glue it back, but work as an electrician to make it light up. Not at all good..."
3,Looks good but quality is not great,For the price it's ok but the little bulb does not illuminate the saber well and it's not easy to turn on or off.
2,Not a good product,"I am glad I brought this product from Amazon, since I am able to return it with out an issue.I am glad I did not present it to someone, it would have made some kid so unhappy.The battery compartment does not and it needs to be broken to insert the batteries. The saber is at a 10 degree angle. Looks awful.Amazon should impose some quality standards of the products it sells. There is a reason why we buy in Amazon."
4,Kids love it,"Got this to go with my sons Halloween costume and it completed the look perfectly. Plus he loved the fact that it lit up, though not very brightly."
2,Cheaply made.,"One of two broke in the first week of use - BEFORE Halloween. Battery compartment closure very finicky (easy to lose screw or tiny, lose lid)"
3,Gift for nephew,"This toy was purchased for my nephew. He was extremely excited to receive it, and set about playing with it immediately. I cannot rate this as an educational toy, and though it didn't break or anything like that, I can see the extending plastic parts being very easily broken. They also extended somewhat crookedly, though he didn't seem to notice much.Overall, especially considering the price, this is a great toy for any young Star Wars fan."
3,good for a careful kid,"This is a super fun toy and has the features to make it look realistic. Material is not super sturdy so must be careful - could be broken fairly easily is dropped or played with too rough. The little lock feature to keep the ""light"" in a closed position is great."
1,Absolute Trash,"This ""costume accessory"" is absolute trash. Within one minute of taking it out the box, without swinging it, adding batteries, turning it on, or extending the saber part, this hunk of junk already had two pieces fall off (a small metal loop and plastic attachment). Within 10 minutes, the small plastic guard which holds the saber in to keep it from always being extended broke as well. By the end of the following day, the cover which seals the battery compartment had snapped off as well. This was not used as a weapon. It was NOT bashed, smashed, or flung; it is simply horribly made without any apparent regard for people actually holding on to it.I find the 5 star reviews for this to be highly suspicious, especially the one from Ruby Perlman, which seems un-coincidentally similar to the name printed on the bottom of the saber. Avoid this trash, and the company that lies about the quality of its products."
3,Blind Vader,This is an inexpensive Darth Vader costume still it would have been nice to be able to actually see through the goggles. The mask is just the front of the helmet not a complete head covering so as long as you're facing towards your intended audience it looks pretty good.
2,Looks cheap and made like that,It is really flimsy! it is also curved to one side. button to turn it on is tiny and requires quite an effort to slide.Save your money!
2,garbage compared too..,"This thing is garbage compared to one I recently bought at walmart for a similar price. This lightsaber handle is big and bulky. It has a tiny light inside that does not illuminate the red plastic at all. The handle is very thin plastic. I can tell it will not last long. The when extended is as crocked as Forest Gump's Legs. But my son doesnt know any better so he loves it, But again he is only 2."
2,Junky,"construction was weak, didn't last more than a week before essentially breaking apart.Didn't have sound, just lit up and with new batteries the light was not very bright..."
2,Don't waste your money!,"Was warped & very cheaply made. Felt like very thin plastic materials were used to make it. Just go to Walmart & buy one, they are much better quality than this one."
2,Extremely Cheap,"Very, very cheap. I'm sure it will break in a matter of hours. I'm not sure it's worth $2. I'm glad I only paid $3."
4,"Non-violent, yet exciting","Yes, this is true. This game is almost totally non-violent, except for the idea of shooting guns. However, as we most should know (especially those of us with children) NERF mock-weapons are the highlight of some boys' lives. My six year old will not part with that big gun he has from NERF, called 'Wildfun' or 'Wildfire', or maybe 'Funfire' (I don't particularly pay attention to the name; just that horrible noise it makes). This makes the game particularly appealing, since you can easily turn the volume down. 3-D gaming excites little ones, unless they can't play it well, and a joystick purchase will improve their appeal. Older ones may enjoy the online gaming feature included. The game initially is for kids from six to Middle School, and will be the highlight of your kid's presents.Oh yeah, and the 'Wildfun' is a gun you can find in the labyrinths available."
2,Fun practice for pronunciation... NOT a course...get a book.,"""Ano"" (yes) - for under $20 you can learn to parrot some very basic Slovak - excellent for pronunciation practice!! (besides, the world's only Slovak CD?!?) I recommend this product so long as you know what to expect.BUT ""Learn Slovak""? No way! There is no danger of learning too much from this CD - it covers simple vocab, about 30 phrases and comes with no supplemental written materials. Also, do not expect to learn anything about the language itself - i.e. no noun genders, syntax, declensions, etc...Technical irritation: it must always be run from the CD thus hogging resources & risks loss if scratched/damaged through use.(Buying idea: if you like languages in general you should definitely consider ""33 Languages"" on CD's from same publisher for about $40 total - it is EXACTLY the same software and includes the Slovak disk plus (guess) 32 more languages. A fun teaser for languages or gift for kids.)"
4,"Nice for beginners, a teaser for those beyond beginner...","This is a very nice primer for those wishing to learn some necessary words for travel to Slovakia. I used this for preparation for a visit to SK, and did fairly well. The locals were amazed at my phonetic understanding and pronunciation that I had learned from this CD. I believe this is one of only a few available Slovak language CDs on the market, so it's a good buy to those beginning in the language and those who need a refresher course in the basics."
5,pleasantly surprised,"This was a book which i bought second hang, i was unsure of the condition in which i would receive it buy i was pleasantly surprise, and very happy. Thank you Amazon for the people you bring to the table i have not be dissapionted as of yet."
1,fraud!,"A quote from an MSNBC article about Arthritis products that don't meet expectations:""For instance, Nature's Plus Ultra Maximum Strength Chondroitin 600, which touts ""highest quality"" chondroitin, turned out to have no chondroitin at all."""
1,Blinc Kiss Me Eyeliner,I really like Blinc Kiss Me Mascara so I decided to try their Eyeliner. I ended up throwing the Eyeliner away because for me it was too hard to apply and I could never get it to look right.
3,Good but could be better.,This eyeliner does stay on pretty good at first but does flake off during the day. The liner brush it comes with is hard to controll. I actually use a brush I had from another liquid eyeliner that works much better. This product is good but not perfect.
3,great product terrible design,"I swatched this on my hand the night i got it and it lasted for 36 hours. it lasted thru washing my hands and face in the morning and night and partly the next day at the beach. I was AMAZED and so excited to use it! but here's the bad news. The design is AWFUL! that stupid little brush makes it so hard to apply, and especially since im a monolid so its extremely difficult and frustrating to get the right amount of liner. also BECAUSE im a monolid and it doesnt dry automatically, it makes my eyelids stick together and then i get raccoon eyes which kinda of defeats the purpose. this stuff is like steel for your eyes but impossible to apply. like someone else said its not worth the effort every morning."
5,eyeliner,"I love this stuff. No smudge all day & night wear and comes off cleanly (in one piece) at the end of the day. Not to mention, I can never find this in any stores."
2,not worth the effort,"I bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed. Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof). If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you. I prefer a softer line, so this didn't.Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring. I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it.This is definitely not worth the pricetag."
2,hard to control,"I had trouble controlling the product. It took several tries before I got a nice even line. However, due to the heavy line, I ended up looking like a raccoon. It was hard not to get the product on the lashes, so it made the lashes stick together. As a result, when you need to apply mascarra,the lashes are 'stuck' together from the eye liner."
3,Blinc Eyeliner,"I have used Blinc for several years and loved it. However, in the past year, or two, I noticed that the eyeliner brush will now quickly fray after only a few uses. Also, the eyeliner chips at times--this was NEVER a problem in prior years. I am not sure if they changed the quality of the brushes and/or ingredients, or if perhaps I did not receive fresh product."
4,On all day...off okay,"I usually end up giving myself a hematoma in my eye, about once a year, from trying too hard to remove eyeliner. After the last hematoma (which is now in its 5th week, still trying to heal), I switched to Kiss Me Liquid Eyeliner, on a doctor-friend's recommendation. My friend was right...you just use a lot of water to remove the eyeliner--no pressure. It comes off in ""pebbles,"" almost. Not very clean, but at least I'm not having to rub so hard. It isn't the easiest thing to apply. It has a rather thick brush and it takes a few coats to put on, because it goes on very thinly. And if you goof while you're painting, you worry that it will dry too fast and not come off in the one spot you need to fix. But it *does* stay on all day. You never have to worry about accidentally rubbing it off. My biggest qualm is that it only comes in black, and I prefer a dark brown."
5,Neat!,"I am using this to coat my lashes, just the ones I want to add shape to my eyes. Not perfect but I like this product better than any mascara I have tried. Easy to put exactly where I want. does not smudge or flake, stays right where you intend. Very clean."
2,Nice idea doesn't work in practice,I like Blinc mascara and so naturally thought I would like the eyeliner. The other reviews are true that you can't blend it and must be careful where you apply it - think marker instead of chalk.However the issue I had is that is starts to come off during the day and looks blotchy. I want to like it but it doesn't stay on like the mascara.
4,Great as a necklace organizer!,"I bought this to use as a necklace organizer, and its perfect. Eight pegs on either side gives you room for at least 16 necklaces, but you can put 2-3 on each peg. It looks very nice on my dresser!"
5,Will this work with Windows XP??,It says 95 or 98 and I wanted to make sure I could use it before buying.
3,The Machinery of Nature,"This book is well-explained about the ""machinery"" of nature. The writer, Paul R. Ehrlich strongly insist that it is significant for us to understand how nature works to us human beings today. He issued many principles of physiological ecology, that how the relationship works with us and our surroundings. He mentioned why population sizes change and how . He gave us many detailed knowledge of examples of how nature goes in this world. He observed carefully toward each sex in the society, and defined who tend to live in a appropriate place, and how they live together. And at the end, the writer expound why we should upkeep our own life support system that maintain our ecosystem exology. I found out this book is very useful general study about our ilving system in Nature. And, Ehrlich is really concern at our natural environment."
1,"Where's ""All I Want""?","Where the hell is ""All I Want""? This was a top-10 Modern Rock hit. There's no excuse for its absence."
3,Some mistakes,"On either page 89 or 69 they call Brutus Collins, Brutus Coolins. Also, they spell Laura Murdoch's last name as both Murdock and Murdoch."
5,"For peace in your day, a must have!","This is probably the most gorgeous and restful music I have ever heard. Every single piece is quiet and reflective. I have given it as a gift to all my friends, for whom the time for reflection and tranquility is a must. A treasure, this album is!"
5,Pure sensual energy!,Two instruments are two lovers from foreplay to more intimate physical movements. A masterpiece of the union of man and instrument. My favorite piece to make love to! A one of a kind experience.
5,Inspirational and Exceptional,"Although this album has been around for awhile, I came across it by accident when looking up the latest work by Michael Hoppe and Martin Tillman. The cello is of course a favorite instrument of mine, and Martin does a wonderful job along with Michael of applying their creative talents and expertise to touch the words of the poet while engaging the listener. Kudos!"
2,"The music lacked depth,emotion and passion","As a massage therapist, I am always searching for beautiful music. So, imagine my surprise when I came across this CD and its wonderful reviews. I purchased it immediately and found that the music lacked depth. The cello notes were sustained and flat much like the proverbial kitty on a fence howling its love song to the full moon. The arrangements were one dimensional and unimaginative. However, the poetry and photography included with the CD was quite enjoyable."
4,Excellent resource for beginning student of the Bible,"This work by Walter C. Kaiser Jr. offers a persuasive Evangelical view of Israelite history during the Old Testament. With a meaningful blend of archaelogical and biblical data, Kaiser presents students of the Bible with relevant information concerning the events and people that most shaped the Old Testament stories. Written in a clear and concise manner, this work also serves as an excellent resource to those searching for an introductory work on the background of the nation Israel during this period in Old Testament history."
2,Incomplete and Inadequate,"First the good: Kaiser is obviously quite knowledgeable, and is not a mere Bible thumper in my opinion, as some of the reviewers seem to think.The bad: This work should be MUCH longer to adequately deal with the material. I am left with many questions. Second, it is clumsily written. Third, I have no objection to the very conservative viewpoint, but I do not think that he ably argues that position at every turn--though he does much of the time. Lastly, some passages are incorrectly referenced. I agree with the reader who thought this work read like a rush job.Dr. Kasier should return to the data and literature, and re-write this work from the ground up, doublling its length."
1,A shallow piece of historical pseudoscience,The bible fundamentalists should choose someone else thanMr Kaiser Jr. to defend the idea of the litteral interpretation of the Bible. Mr Kaiser's reasonings are infantile and do very little to support his extremely conservative view. For instance the primacy he claims for textual material (the Bible) over acheological finding ignores the fact that archeology gives information on what happened at the time it happened whereas the biblible is an oral and then written tradition whose earliest exponents are at least one thousand years later than the events they describe.Mi suggestion is not to buy this book
1,What a piece of junk,"It looks good in the picture, but don't even think of buying this piece of junk. It's way too big for a travel clock, the digital and anlaog clocks are not connected to each other, and the other features are awkward to use."
2,An okay Alarm Clock,"I had such great expectations for the alarm clock when I purchased it over a year ago. First of all it works fine. It sits nice and compact on my nightstand. However, it has too many little problems to make it worth the hassle.The alarm clock has too many batteries to keep up with; one for the analog and one for digital clock and the nature sounds can be heard bleeding through when the radio is playing. Its just slight but its annoying to me.Its not worth the hassle or money."
5,WOOOOOOOW!,"This clock is so cool! I love the nature sounds to get me to sleep. This clock isn't portable but it's for desks,nightstands,etc. If you want to get a clock for home this is thee clock to get!"
3,Looks like it may be a Moen 3520 in a 3510 box.,"I'm sure these valves are ok, but I was expecting threads on the inlets to match up with my pex to IPS fittings. Bought a pair of them and they are both the same... no threads."
4,Good visitor's guide,"This book is an excellent visitor's guide. It is full of high quality pictures and maps that will guide you to the important sights. The text is rather dry, but this is only of concern in the somewhat long introduction that deals with the history of Pompeii. After that the book follows a pattern of a photograph or other picture on each page with a detailed legend explaining what is being shown. Even if you don't visit Pompeii you will know what you would have seen if you did."
4,Excellent,"Excellent detailed guide to Pompeii. Probably worth reading it before you get there, there is a lot of information."
5,Fun to play with the entire family!,"I've got to say that this game is fun to play even if you are not a Hannah Montana fan. My goddaughter has just received this DVD as a birthday gift, and since it was her birthday, the whole family played it with her. There is a section where people play in teams, and act out words or draw things and have their teammates guess the answers. Even the guys in the group gave it a try, and we all had a lot of fun. A really clever game!"
3,"A Nice Animal Book for Babies and Toddlers - a review of ""Early Morning in the Barn""","This is one of Nancy Tafuri's lesser known books, but is quite a nice one. In this mostly wordless book (there is no text except for animal sounds like `cheep, cheep' and `moo'), a clutch of chicks visits their barnyard neighbors.Too simple for preschoolers, I think it would be popular with older babies and toddlers as the pages are full - from top to bottom-with colorful artwork.Three Stars. [C+]. Lovely Tafuri artwork. There is no text but lots to look at for small fry."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"Years back, I read Merle's first biography, ""Sing Me Back Home"". This was very in-depth and interesting; which I found this book totally opposite of. There are parts of this book which you know are Merle's words, and others, which are clearly Tom Carter's. There, it's an inconsistency.Merle chooses to delete certain information which he reveals in his first biography, so therefore, it really isn't a secret. Also, some of the language used in this book is deplorable. The point can be well made with those words omitted.Overall, I prefer his first book. While that one only extended to a certain point of his life, it was better-written and held the reader's interest much better. This book should've been written the same way, and picked-up where the other one left off. Instead, it rehashes old facts which we already know."
4,Entertaining and revealing story,"I enjoyed reading this book about a singer whose music I've always loved. Tom Carter did a good job with the chatty style, and I liked Merle's humor and honesty and humility. I highly recommend the book."
3,An ok game from an older computer,This game does not compete with newer games such as the command and conquer series or any newer games. It lacks in graphics but is a good game if you own an older computer or one with less ram and less graphics power. It is still fun to kill time on though
2,Nostalgia Only,"Good for nostalgia purposes only...the game is marginally fun at either level, but since I got the game in a value pack with 3 other games I can't complain too much. I'd suggest keeping this in mind before you buy the game at any price: do you remember the arcade game? If not then pass. Or play the original at Games.com to see if you'd be interested in this, which is somewhat updated from the Arcade Version but not too much."
1,I think the copier is just bad !,"Bought this thin Canon personal copier. We didn't set it up for over a year. When I set it up nothing would be printed on the paper. Called Cannon and it was beyond the warranty period. Got this cartridge cause it was dirt cheap. I then checked the reviews of this model and the reviews were terrible, just as I am stating. Very strange as I have other Canon products that have lasted for years. This cartridge printed, but 5 months later with very little use (40 pages) the prints are terrible. A new toner cartridge is more then half the printer, so it's getting tossed. A large Canon printer/scanner another person is using has been running fine for 3 years. This copier is just a bad product/design. Sorry I didn't open it earlier during the warranty and have them send a different model. So I can't tell if the copier is just so bad or we got a defective cartridge."
5,"Great Product, Great Service","I accedently ordered the wrong size and was no issue to exchange. Very nice, high quality collar!"
3,Curt 55326 wire harness,"This device does not fit a 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis LS as stated on the Amazonparts selector. It only works up to 1997. Curt harness #58044 is for latermodels and must be spliced in. This(55326) harness just plugs in and lookslike a great way to put on a trailer plug. I am sure it works great on the correctmodel cars. Note for Curt Mfg. - Amazon does NOT download directly from Curtwhat parts fit each model, so check the Curt site first for compatibility."
1,Detriot Tigers Blanket,"60 by eighty is the size of a queen bed. this is about 5 inches both ways smaller than what it was claimed and i am very dissapointed. It barely covers my Full sized bed. actually its a just fit. I messured it and it is really 55 by 74 inches. I would not purchase this if you have a full sized, queen, or king sized bed. Only for a twin sized or a throw."
2,Didn't hold up to 'washing',"Bought this for my son who is a CLEVELAND INDIANS FAN - unfortunately, it did not hold up when he washed it. I'm not sure if he washed it correctly, but it turned into a pile of fuzz. I was so disappointed."
5,"Nice, warm and comfortable!",The blanket was a nice size. Would fit a twin size bed nicely. They are not too heavy and not too thin either!
5,Great,"Bought this for my brother cause hes a phillies fan, soft an comfortable. I would recommend this for anyone thats a phillies fan."
1,Very Disappointed,"The blurbs for this book are very misleading. It is a text for beginning investors. Each chapter starts with a quote from Twain, but it has little else to do with him. The entire references to Twain probably don't exceed 5 pages of text. If you are interested in Mark Twain - forget it. Not much here. If you are interested in basic investing principles - likewise forget it - I have seen much better."
3,"More Twain, Less Leckey","I was hoping this book would be more Twain and less Leckey. I was disappointed. Each chapter starts with one quote from Twain, and Leckey provides some background context. That's about 10% of the book. The other 90% is Investing 101 stuff."
4,Manhattan Transfer does it again.,One of my favorite groups and the Transfer do not disappoint with their fabulous harmonies. One of the worlds best groups.
3,"Horizon, A Magazine of the Arts, Summer 1971, Volume XIII, Number 3","If I remember correctly, this item was described as being 'like new', or at least in 'very good' condition. Unfortunately, although it is intact and not missing any pages, it exudes a very strong musty smell, as if it has been stored in a damp basement for a long time. This seriously compromises its usability for me and its attractiveness as a collectible for others. I will have to explore methods of deodorizing it. Disappointing."
4,All About Paula.......,"Jessica Wakefield manages to snag a leading role as Lady M in the school's production of Macbeth.At the same time, a new girl Paula, begins at SVH and quickly becomes Jessica's number 1 fan. Paula manages to infiltrate Jess's snobby clique and also become her understudy.Jessica is more than happy to have someone at her beck and call and Paula seems more than happy to be this.However, underneath Paula's meek and mild mask is a character who is just as devious as Jessica, in fact even more so, as she is planning on sabotaging Jessica's role and grabbing the lead for herself.This book is strongly influenced by ""All About Eve"" but, is well worth a read and contains all the typical SV elements that makes the series so well worth reading, even if the books are pretty hard to get ahold of now."
4,encore!,"This is a better Sweet Valley High book,in which a wicked girl is jealous of the amazing Jessica,and pretends to be shy and to be Jess's friends.Behind Jess's back,she is an extrovert who is planning to take Jessicas place in a shakespearan play.Jessica deals with this schemer in a noble fashion,and shines with class and dignity."
4,Retro Look Combines with Ease of Use to make a Great Clock!,"I've only had it for a week, but I LOVE my new clock. I love its retro styling, which fits in wonderfully with the decor of our bedroom, and I love the fact that it combines an analog and digital clock into one.Easy to learn to use, easy to get going, etc. Great alarm, which grows louder the longer you wait to turn it off, etc. The only drawback I found was that it took me until last night to figure out how to get the clock's internal light to turn down so it didn't blind me in the night.Forget the naysayers, enjoy this clock!"
2,Cute only goes so far,"When I first got this clock in December, I thought it was great. Great price for a nice little clock -- and easy to operate if you are willing to refer to the directions. But 5 months later, the alarm and time setting functions have completely stopped working. In December I would have given it 5 stars. But now, I think 2 stars is pretty generous."
2,Analog clock stopped working,"It worked great for about a month, then the analog clock stopped working.I love the design though and the alarm was very nice. It started out soft and got progressively louder until you woke.I'm pretty sure mine was just a fluke, but who knows."
2,Recommended for deaf people,"I bought this because I like analog clocks, and this was the only clock radio I could find with an analog clock. That part is nice, but the sound quality for music is very poor, very tinny. It's fairly good for talk radio, but not for music. It has some nice features, if you don't mind futzing around with learning the controls on yet another electronic device."
2,I Take Back my Good Review!,"Though the alarm works fine, after a year and a half with this radio, I'm really disappointed with it. The analog clock stopped working a few months after I received it so my clock is always on 6:15, which is really confusing when you first wake up and aren't thinking clearly. I originally gave a good review before the analog went out on it."
2,You get what you pay for,"I think the nature sounds are sad. The loop of the bird calls is about two seconds long. If you like to listen to the same shrill whistle fine. The fidelity is really bad. The ocean waves, I think it is ocean waves, are more like static waves. Like a transformer is about to blow. Not very restful, although you can use it to wake up to. The radio, as someone mentionned, is something you'd get as a toy in a fast food promotion about fifteen years ago. The body of the thing has buttons everywhere. So it is not that easy to figure out what you have to do to have a simple alarm. The package came from Amazon as a pre used product and two of the three batteries were gone and the one that was in the box was still in the machine and had been drained. This ranks up there as the worse purchase I have made on Amazon. On the bright side, the design does look cool with the clock illuminated very nicely."
2,Time is Money!,"When I ordered my clock, I wanted it within the next three weeks! I could have driven to Texas, or wherever, and got it myself! From the day I ordered it, the clock actually arrived 17 days later! And after Christmas too, so not an excuse! Then, when I opened the shipment paper on the package (sent Fed-ex...not so ex...), the sheet said it was actually sent 5 days prior to it's arrival...Yet, the seller sent me a notice via email saying that it was shipped 2 days after I placed the order. I would like to know where it was between those 9 days!Other than the lightyear it took to arrive, I really like my clock. The nature sounds and bells are cool, and very relaxing.So I do recommend purchasing this product, as it is quite enjoyable. Only, go to a local store..."
3,"This is a dye ink printer, not a pigment ink system.","Epson's newest series of portable printers seem like a downgrade compared with their previous printer, the picturemate deluxe.The prints speeds are improved a bit in some of these new printers, but all these new printers use a dye based ink system instead of pigment based ink. Pigment based ink is used in Epson's professional line of printers because the ink has been tested to last 200 years in a photo book or 100 years in a glass frame. Notice that Epson does not comment on how long prints will last from these dye ink printers.Though, for the average consumer, they may find the other features of this printer appealing. It has a faster print speed compared with the picturemate deluxe. I own the picturemate deluxe and do not find it's print speed too slow. I'm sure the print quality of the picturemate pal will long just as nice, but it will not be suitable for archival prints if this is important to you."
5,I love this printer!,This is a great printer. The photo quality is fantastic and it's super easy to use. The borders are also very fun. I made my own Christmas cards this year!There are more print layout options when you use it as a standalone printer (not through the PC) like printing wallet size.
4,Great photo printer for the price,This is a great printer. I compared the print quality with a more expensive HP printer and basically there was not much a difference. So I chose this printer and it has been great. I would definitely purchase this again.
2,Nice quality photos...when it works,"I've had this printer for a couple years. It just printed it's last photo.The quality of the photos was great when I could get it to work. Almost every time I used it, I had to do multiple self-cleanings, which need to be initiated over and over for about 20 minutes. At $35 a print pack and only printing ~30 photos each, it is an expensive print at about $1 a print. I won't buy a printer that doesn't sell ink separately from the paper again. Even wasting as much paper as I did on the self cleaning, I still have a few hundred sheets left over because the ink always ran out long before the paper did.If you're willing to spend $1/print and replace in two years, you might be happy with this. I'm not."
4,This could use a remastering,"This cd would be much more enjoyable if it got a superb remastering job. I like every song a lot, except, ""Forms of Life"" which is a too repetitive track without any guitars or drums. I can't believe that it made it on the best of collection. This doesn't have that crisp high end that I like to hear. The drums have that dry non-ambient sound without the high crisp cymbals. They've remastered much of the Jean-Luc Ponty catalog and it's a shame they haven't got around to doing this one,thus, I've removed one star for the poor sound quality."
5,Great introduction,"Early Ponty is marred for me by the poor recording techniques used. What I mean is, if you listen to early Ponty it seems clear that the record producers had no idea how to handle a violin, and it comes out sounding like a bad guitar.This album changed all that. It was my introduction to Ponty so I guess I'll always have a soft spot for it - but really, it is very good. The sound is great - it's not too far toward the middle of the road, and his band was really gelling here.It also has some nice guitar work. ""Once a Blue Planet"" is wonderful. The sound clicks available here are very representitive of the music on the album."
5,Still Stellar After All these Years....,"....there ain't nothing on earth like the sound of Ponty's zapped-up violin. Call it Music from inside the SuperNova. This is one of my favorites. I have it on cassette and after a long wait in my stacks, I played it one day. Pretty much blew me away, like always--my favorite is the ultrofusion cut ""Happy Robots"". So, like the progressive that I am, I upgraded my Ponty...I purchased it on CD and am now happily enjoying my cross town travels with it. It is in my car player as I am writing this. I feel like I am in the space shuttle when ""Forms of Life"" is playing...."
3,Learn Sindhi!,I was hoping for to be able to pickup some phrases so I can correctly talk to my elders but it did not really help me. My family speaks Sindhi but a different dialect and the pronounciations were odd. If you don't know any Sindhi then maybe it might be useful but in my case it is just sitting onmy shelf collecting dust.
5,better than a lot of adult books,I'm substitute teaching and I just read this book to a bunch of first graders. I was cracking up laughing all the way through (the kids were a bit puzzled). Cute book and entertaining for all ages - nevermind the ages 4-8 designation. The illustrations are priceless.
5,Top honors at our house!!,"Officer Buckle and Gloria offers a story enjoyable to both kids and adults. The illustrations of Gloria's antics are done without written comment...thus a book about partnership as witnessed between the writing and illustrations (the misspelling of Napville in 1 of the illustrations not withstanding). Younger kids feel a participation in Gloria's stunts as the adult reads, seemingly unaware as is Officer Buckle. The notes of safety tips tucked in multiple illustrations and both covers of the book also make the reading slightly different each time. The thank-you notes sent by Claire, the helmet-wearing safety conscious student who is a favorite of Officer Buckle, tie a great story together. Kids love the message of friendship and forgiveness hidden in the overt ""safety tips"". This book is a favorite of both my 8 year old and 5 year old."
5,Always Entertaining,"We've had this book a few years now, and my son, now 6, never tires of it. It's one of his favorites, and I really like it too. As other reviewers have mentioned, the pictures are great, and there's so much detail in them that they're fun to look at again and again."
2,book,"THey said this CHILDREN'S book was in ""good"" condition; however, there were three four-letter curse words scratched quite legibly into the cover and I can't use it. Bummer"
4,Very Interesting,"I found this a very good book to pass the time.The events in this book seemed to be well though out. The author went from one scene to another which kept you on your toes.The character touch the sky,seem a little bit like superman the way he was able to go from one place to another without beening badly hurt. And on the other hand you had to feel for the children."
3,Okay,Q tips break quite easy but not too bad for the money. I work in a salon and ust them regularly
3,Shes got a pretty good voice,"I listen to this cd & shes got a pretty good voice but wrong material. I think she,d better suited for religious songs & maybe jazz songs only to suit her voice better. 3 - rtg. from me Bretz"
5,Easy to use and did the job,A low cost alternative to having a plumber replace the faucet. Not mentioned in the description is that it comes with instructions on the pack (although these were hardly necessary). No more chewed washers and dripping faucets.
5,I wanna know...,"My fav. songs from the movie are: The Secret Love Song, and How Wonderful Life is Now That Your in the World. Before I go and buy the CD, I wanna know if it has those songs. So please post a review to answer my question. Thanks a bunch!!"
5,AWESOME!,"Hey! Actually I just got ma CD even though I bought it 2 weeks ago cuz it got stuck in my friends CD player in his car.. so i couldn't get it out.. nehow.. this is the weirdest yet most creative and eccentric CD i've ever heard.. Lady Marmalade was the first track i turned to and itz really kewl cuz of the bass and background sounds.. my favorites include the really cool sounding Hindu Sad Diamonds.. i also liked the Sparkling Diamonds medly.. the whole CD rocks and therez something on it for everyone! the rock ""Chidren of the Revolution"" and the dance ""Because We Can"" goes through the whole music spectrum.. even Nicole Kidman has a great voice, but i don't really like Ewan McGregor's voice...the whole CD is bursting with energy.. i listened to it at nite hoping that i could fall asleep to it.. but it was so exhilarating that i couldn't sleep for 2 hours.. but oh well.. i loved it! go buy it.. i hafn't seen the movie but i hope it'll be even better! hard to beat though ;-)"
2,don't spend the seventeen dollars,"I bought this on a whim, having seen a lot of previews for the movie. boy, is it laughable-literally, some of the songs (namely rhythm of the night, roxanne, elephant love medley, hindi sad diamonds) are cheesy and awful beyond belief. The voices of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor are tolerable, although their tracks are definitely over-produced to attempt to cover up their inadequacies.No one buys a soundtrack expecting a classic, and after getting past the really bad tracks named above, some of the rest is pleasant and even, occasionally, fun. Just overall, mediocre."
3,3 1/2 stars if I could...,"This is a fund CD. Some of it is great, some of it is not-so-great. Overall, though, I enjoyed it. Purists probably won't enjoy it at all... There are so many new versions of different songs... The catchy new rendition of Lady Marmalade, as well as the remake of Rhythm of the Night, the awful rendition of Your Song, a cute version of Sparkling Diamonds, and a great song --Children of the Revolution make for an interesting CD. Some people have reviewed it as an odd combination, but if you enjoy CDs that leave you guessing, this one is for you!"
3,Where's The Beef?,"Mmaaan... they left the meat out of the sandwich. I might as well be ordering myself the vegetarian. It should go like this, song after song, just like the movie, front to back. After I saw the movie once not including the times after, I said to myself, ""This is the best moive I'v seen since, William Shakespears A Midsummer's Night Dream."" And I saw that one, well God knows how many times, but the morall of this story is that I loved everything about the movie, especially the songs that I can't beg for somthing that isn't available so I'll take what I can have and wish that all songs will come later on one nice compact CD that I can play over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over until it gets so hot inside my player that they become one with the exsistance of all living stuff! Wwwoowww, what ever that meant? I don't know what came over me. I just phayz-owt sometimes mmaann. heh... Oh well, it sounded cool anyways. heh!"
3,Buyer Beware!,"Before you buy this album, be sure that you want an album that has the exact recordings from the movie AND!!!!! versions of songs from the movie that you probably did not pay too much attention to because you were so caught up with Ewan and Nicole singing their hearts out. Those cuts are here and will surely remind you of the great scenes from the movie, but the versions of other songs don't seem to fit. Personally, I would like to have had all of the new versions of the songs sung directly from the cast rather than those I barely even noticed. All in all this cd is ok, mostly it will make you remember the finer moments the movie had to offer."
4,"Great eclectic collection, and Nicole can sing","The movie's not bad at all, and the soundtrack follows, with some great music and very original music from Nicole K, Ewan McGregor and Fatboy Slim. The Pink, Mya etc song is already a hit, and this is definitely one of the best soundtracks of the year so far."
1,Run...Don't walk...Away from this CD,"I bought this CD in hopes of a decent musical romp...instead I was audibly assaulted by a rather hokey collection of so-called songs. From Nicole Kidman's awful rendition of ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" to the laughable hodgepodge called ""The Elephant Love Medley"", the ""Moulin Rouge"" soundtrack is one hysterical musical! How can one not laugh at the tango version of ""Roxanne""? The only saving grace is ""Lady Marmalade"". Don't get me wrong, I love musicals and cheese...but not when it's done this bad. Give me ""Rocky Horror"" any day."
2,Missing the best,"I also was blown away by the film. The song segues throughout the film were breathtakingly brilliant. It's a shame that whoever built this album did not think it could stand on its own, hopefully it will be released as intended. The break between I'll Fly away, and Christian's response is unforgivable. How can a film have such heartstopping musical momentum, and not allow it on the CD? For a good example of hearing the movie through the music, check out the soundtrack for GIGI. It has the words before the songs, they're in the right order, and sung by the principals, just like this soundtrack should have been."
3,Hoping for more,"I am going to have to agree with some of the first reviews of this CD that I read, commenting on the CD's lack of material from the movie. I, too thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and was a bit disappointed that many of its best songs are not present on the soundtrack. Personally, I was pretty pumped for ""like a virgin"". The songs sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman that are included on the CD, however, are great. I was just hoping for a more complete version of the film's music. I think it would be a good idea if they released a CD of the movie's complete music."
4,EWAN MCGREGOR IS SMASHING!,I LOVE THIS MOVIE! IT IS ONE WILD RIDE AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS JUST ABOUT TOPS TOO! A FEW MUSICAL SNIPPETS ARE A BIT POINTLESS BUT KIDMAN SOUNDS WONDERFUL AND MCGREGOR IS JUST SMASHING...NOT ONLY DOES HE GIVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE FILM BUT THE MAN CAN SING...WHO KNEW?
1,Not what expected,"Most of the music on the soundtrack must be music used during the credits or opening or something - it was not the more popular music within the movie itself, which is what I was hoping for."
4,Why buy a motion picture soundtrack if you don't like it...,Of course I like this soundtrack. I enjoyed the music from the movie.This isn't a toaster oven so you should know if you like it or not before you purchase it. If your not sure then you may wish to check it out at the library.
4,A must have for music lovers.,"I absolutely love this album. I even think Ewan McGregor's version of ""My Song"" is better than Elton John's! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does not have all of the songs from the movie. As another reviewer said, they should come out with a ""More Moulin Rouge"" so they can put the other great songs and mixes from the movie that were left off. (Such as Zidler's rap-mix with Lady M., all the versions of Come What May and John Leguizamo's Nature Boy.)"
4,If You Don't Mind Weirdness and Techno...,"The music on this soundtrack ranges from weird to wonderful and back again. I'm a big fan of David Bowie's music, so I really bought the soundtrack for Nature Boy and the Beck cover of Diamond Dogs (which, by the way, is kind of odd but very cool). There's a lot of fabulous dance music on this CD, and some really interesting vocals by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who is not only a talented and attractive actor but has a beautiful singing voice). Lots of neat covers, the best of which are within the Elephant Love Medley. I really like this CD but it is very strange, which is why I gave it 4 stars. A little weird for me sometimes."
4,"Wonderful, though not complete","Being a raving fan of the movie, I was thrilled with much of the material in this soundtrack. The songs by Ewan and Nicole were as strong here as they were in the movie. Lady Marmalade was strong as was David Bowie's Nature Boy. Only complaints would be more about what was not used in this soundtrack. Hopefully they will be placed in the sequel soundtrack just released."
4,Music that's crazily smoooth...,"This is a great thing to buy if you liked the MR movie because it has almost every song you could want. Almost - there's a few songs (such as Kylie Minogue's appearance) that are omitted and I'd much rather have had them than the instrumentals provided on the second CD or the Lady Marmalade remix (I do like that song, but you can hear it too many times.) Practically every song on this though is enjoyable and there's a nice range of different types of music. Overall it's a rich and exciting selection and getting two CDs is a bargain."
3,A good start,"A long long time ago you could go and see a movie musical, and then you could go to the local record store and buy the soundtrack, and the soundtrack would contain all the songs in the movie. Gone are those carefree days when movies were nothing more than freestanding pieces of entertainment that weren't cross marketed by multinational parent companies. Now when you buy a soundtrack there's no telling what you'll get. That being said, the Moulin Rouge soundtrack comes very close, containing roughly 65% of the songs in the movie. The songs I wanted most (Like a Virgin, Spectacular Spectacular, The Show must Go On, the haunting closing credit music) are not here. I love the movie, and I love the songs that are here (I'm sorry, but Nicole Kidman can sing way better than Lil' Kim) but overall I'm disappointed in yet another incomplete soundtrack."
3,What I think is missing from the soundtrack,"I would prefer to have a soundtrack with the stars that sang the songs in the film, singing them on the CD. While I appreciate the other musicians that are on the CD, it is just not what I wanted. The songs on the CD are just not the same as from the film. I would have prefered both versions on ""Come What May"" as they were sung in the film. I also would have prefered, ""Nature Boy"" sung as it was in the film. I just think they could have done a better job with the CD considering this was an amazing film. Hearing the music in the film is what you want to hear on the CD, and it is very disappointing that it isn't. But, I gave it a three rating because I love both Ewan and Nicloes recordings and it is too bad that we couldn't have heard the enitre cast performance of ""Come What May"". If youare hoping to hear on the CD what you heard in the film, buy the ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE soundtrack, and not this one."
4,4/5 Stars,This soundtrack almost does this fantatic movie justice. I am not sure what I am suppossed to say other than get this now!!!
5,I LOVE MOULIN ROUGE,"i love moulin rouge and the the soundtrack i think its awsome!!!! the only problem is that i can never find the lyrics for the music they sing, even though i know every word it would be soo much easier to just copy and paste them instead of writting them all up.. thank youi LOVE MOULIN ROUGE!!"
5,OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU MUST LISTEN TO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"Ewan McGregor, aka Obi Wan Kenobi, is SO AWESOME IN THIS FILM. Personally, i didn't know he could sing until this came out, and i couldn't believe it!!!!! Ewan's voice is sooooooooo wonderful that you won't be able to stop listening (or at least i can't stop listening). When he sings, the world listens. The songs are great, and the lyrics are even better. You won't believe your ears!"
5,"Spectacular, Spectacular!","My friend told me he'd heard the soundtrack was just a bunch of covers of sappy old love songs.It's so much MORE than that! It's an amazing assortment of lyrics, taken from songs of all genres and eras put together in an ingenious conglomoration, making for a soundtrack that crosses all kinds of musical boundaries. Ewan McGregor (Christian) and Nicole Kidman (Satine) sing their characters' songs, and they have incredible hidden talent that would never have been discovered, had it not been for producer/director Baz Luhrman's perfectionistic vision. The nightclub, however hand-me-down in name, leaves room for an anything goes attitude, influenced and encouraged by the Bohemian themes of the movie's plot and characters. All around, it's a wonderful display of talent on both sides of the mic."
1,Disappointed,"Since I saw Moulin Rouge, I haven't been able to get the music from the first time they visit the Moulin Rouge out of my mind. The meshing of several different songs at the same time from what I believe is a melody from Nirvana, to Lady Marmalade, is absolutely striking. I hurriedly bought the soundtrack because I couldn't get enough of the synergy from the music. I was VERY disappointed listening to the soundtrack within the first 30 seconds, and it didn't get better after that. All the synergy and life that was actually in the movie is almost completely missing in the soundtrack. And how could they POSSIBLY leave out the rendition of ""Like a Virgin""?!? I could not recommend this CD less. They are releasing a ""Moulin Rouge 2"" soundtrack. I will still give them a chance on this one. The DVD, on the other hand, run, don't walk, to get your copy."
4,***AT LAST SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT***,"Not since 'Phantom of the Opera' has a film or a 'Musical soundtrack' to boot captivated audiences with its pioneering storyline modified to appeal to the masses and the millennium with such applaudable success.I loved this soundtrack, I loved hearing 2 of the hottest actors of our generation earn their magebucks and show us such fantastic melifluous voices and deliver the lyrics so evokingly accurate to the core story of the film.Not since Evita has their been a soundtrack like this, just listen to Ewan Macgregor ( the force IS with him ) sing 'Come what may' it like many others on this album are a tour de force of emotion and originality and renews your faith in Hollywood.... , whether your taste in music is diversified or not this a cool , moving , retro , hip album and your a phillistine without it."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"When I first heard that there had been a musical made with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, I thought the movie industry had hit a new low. But when I heard my friend's copy of the cd, I found I had been wrong. It had some wonderful music. ""Your Song"" is one of my top three favorite songs now, and nobody can sing it like Ewan MacGregor. I was most surprised by the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. They can really sing! This is an excellent piece of work."
4,Great!,"Unfortunately, I haven't seen this movie YET... but I'm sure I would probably love it more if I had seen this movie.I love this soundtrack, it's really lively and a pleasure to listen to. I'm glad I decided to buy it."
5,addictive,"normally, when listening to any CD, whether it is a soundtrack or not you can find yourself skipping over songs. I rate this CD as an official no skipping songs CD. You can't miss a song, and once u pop it in, you don't wanna leave it play and not be in hearing distance.I loved the movie, it was artistically stunning, but until listening to all the songs on another friends CD, I wouldnt have bought it. Its worth the money.I havent gotten to the 2nd version of it yet, but i cant wait for it."
3,Okay,"This CD wasn't my favortie but, it has some great songs. I have never seen the movie, but listening to the soundtrack definatley made me want to see the movie."
3,Where'd the music go???,"I saw the movie and fell in love with it. Two of my favorite songs from the movie, Madonna's Like A Virgin and Queen's The Show Must Go On, aren't even included on the soundtrack. Plus they add tracks that's aren't even in the movie, like a mangled rendition of Can-Can. Very disappointed they left off some of the movie's best music! The rest of the soundtrack is great. But c'mon, at least include the songs that people responded to and fell in love with!"
2,Very disappointed,"Loved the music in the movie -- thought I'd by the CD. Mistake! Some of the best songs from the movie are missing...like ""Spectacular Spectacular"" and ""Like a Virgin"" and more. Plus there are some lousy songs that weren't even in the move. I actually thought it was a mistake and that I ordered the wrong thing! Unfortunately not. I feel cheated!"
3,Not a complete soundtrack!,"While this is an enjoyable cd it is not a real soundtrack! It is missing about half of the songs! Songs like ""The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)"",""Meet You in the Red Room"",""The Show Must Go On"", and ""Like a Virgin."" And out of the song that are in the movie, they are completely different! I suggest if you buy this cd, also by theMoulin Rouge 2 Soundtrack. This was a soundtrack released later that included the missing songs and also included the ""movie versions"" of the songs that were changed on the original soundtrack. If you buy both you will have all the music from the movie. But if you buy #1 or #2 either by themselves. You will be missing songs."
3,Music to over-whelm your senses!!!,"What were they thinking??!! Among other songs from the movie not on this CD is the wonderfull and stirring version of ""The Show Must Go On"" It is full of lush strings and emotion, simply a brilliant arrangement of a brilliant song. I brought this CD when it first came out, and was SO very disapointed that this track in particular was omitted!! That and the fact it is not the sound track off the film is the reason I have only given this CD a 3 star rating. However it is still an excellent CD, and well worth a listen. My recomendation would be to skip buying both CDs, and purchase the double DVD instead! It is a visual and audio feast not to be missed!(best viewed on a very large screen). Of course I also have the DVD now, so I am not buying the second CD..... Do the marketers think I'm that big a sucker??!!"
4,Moulin Rouge,"Moulin Rouge was one of my favorite movies of last year, so the inclusion of its' soundtrack on my top 20 should be of little surprise. I could do without the new version of ""Lady Marmalade"" and would've rather heard more songs included from the movie rather than being enticed to purchase a second edition of the disc which wasn't released until about a year later. I really enjoy that Ewan & Nicole don't have classically trained vocals as I think the wavering of the vocal cords provides for the expression of more emotion than if they had been singing their entire careers. Plus the disc has a Rufus Wainwright song on it giving him at least 2 mentions in this year's top 20! Moulin Rouge is the epitome of postmodernism and will surely be celebrated 50 years from now as one of the movement's pivotal films & musical selections. (originally written May 2002)"
4,"Some Amazing songs, others are lacking","Songs like ""Your Song"", ""Elephant Love Medley"", and ""Come What May"" make this soundtrack. The more crappy ones like ""Lady Marmalade"" don't. If you're going to buy this CD, I suggest you buy the second Moulin Rouge soundtrack which includes the amazing end credits song ""Bolero"", many instrumental background music pieces, and songs like ""Like a Virgin"" and ""The Pitch"" which were fun songs in the movie which shouldn't have been left out of this CD."
2,Moulin Rouge Soundtrack,"I really liked the movie and decided to get the soundtrack. In the movie I was thoroughly surprised by and equally enjoyed both Kidman and McGregor's voices and thought the musical arrangements were wonderful. I expected the soundtrack to reflect what was offered in the movie. Not so. First of all they left out some great stuff while opting to include songs that were not even in the movie. Second, the arrangements they put into the cd were the 'perfectly rehearsed and recorded' versions not the movie performances(I didn't care for the elevator pop rendition of 'Come What May'-a great song in the movie-or the greatly shortened, emasculated version of 'Roxanne'). The movie was a wonderful mixture of melo-drama, color, intensity, emotion - sensorially stunning - and the original soundtrack captured and reflected all of it. The released, sanitized version does not."
3,why mess with a good thing?,"i loved the movie and what it did musically. so of course i was hoping to get the soundtrack and relive those memorable renditions of popular songs, especially by nicole and ewan. but why oh why did i have to be bombarded with all this other junk? i understand that some people like to have these other songs added in that aren't in the movie. but can't you separate the two? there are 2 separate soundtracks for the movie. so why couldn't one of them be purely movie soundtrack and the other disc be made up of all that 'inspired by' stuff? they do this to my everytime. the chicago soundtrack was absolutely wonderful until the they stuck in those oddball songs at the end. please, if the song didn't make it into the movie, it doesn't really need to be on the soundtrack."
5,A Feast for the ears!,"I am a lover of great music, and this one tops my list. It has all the energy I like, the quality I have come to expect and a few twists thrown in for fun.Ewan McGregor should consider a more complete career with time spent on the stage, doing what seems to come naturally. And Nicole, WOW! I love this one from start to finish. Anytime I need a little juice in my day, this is where I turn and then I turn it UP!"
4,where's the rest of it?,"I actually bought this before I saw the movie, so at first it seemed like a great soundtrack. As an avid Bono fan, I was thrilled to see his name among the list of artists, along with Beck, David Bowie, etc. I even have to admit that I like the soundtrack version of ""Lady Marmelade""... although I have to be in the right mood to hear it... and I was pleasantly surprised by the vocal talents of Nicole and Ewan. Over all this CD was well worth the money I spent on it...but...after seeing the movie, I have to ask...where's the rest of the soundtrack? what happened to ""Like a Virgin,"" ""Spectacular, Spectacular""?...and I'm *definitely* missing ""The Show Must Go On,"" which was easily my favorite song (and one of my favorite scenes) in the movie. Just including the Queen cover would have pushed this all the way to a 5 star CD, for me. It's still great, though, and I don't regret buying it in the least... I'll just keep hoping for a ""More Music from..."" CD."
2,For Shame!!,"When you buy the soundtrack to a musical, it's reasonable to expect that you'll be getting the songs that were in the musical as they were? I think so! Well, you get this here...sort of. Some of the songs that we all love are there, and others aren't. Instead they're replaced by stupid pop songs. You can get all the songs as they were (more or less) in the movie, BUTyou have to buy the second CD! What a ploy! I was mightily upset by this. If you like pop versions and remixes, then the CD(s) will probably be worth your money, but if you want the original songs, you can probably save money by buying them off the iMusic store."
5,Creativity at It's Best from one Boho to another,"I saw the film yesterday and HAD to have the soundtrack today. The whole time I was watching the movie all I could see was hordes of fans dressing up and singing along with the film...such fun and opens up freedom in the heart...yes, Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love just like the movie portrays. The only disappointment for me (but not enought to give it 4 stars)on the CD was it was missing the wonderfully nutsy rendition of Like A Virgin...in fact I visited to see if there is a second CD with ""more"" music."
2,A Disappointment,"When I bought this cd, I was pretty excited. The movie had been great and I really enjoyed the music. This soundtrack, however, was a disappointment. Most of the songs are cheesy and boring, with ultra pop-styled lyrics. There are a few songs that are good, but only because they're the same as they were in the movie. Most of the others were redone and poorly so. I also bought the second soundtrack, and its inclusion of the more obscure but higher quality tracks from the movie, as well as just simply including the origninal tracks from the movie, make it a more enjoyable buy."
2,moulin rouge volume three,Moulin Rouge was a great movie to watch at the cinema i've got both of the moulin rouge movie soundtracks I am a bit dissapointed with the second one it dosn't have all of the songs on the second soundtrack they are these:1 The children of the revoultion2 The sound of music3 Diamonds are a girls best friend4 Nature boy remix5 Satine's musical love theme6 Pride in the name of love7 The end come what may your song one day i'll fly away finale8 The Dukes Plan9 Smells like lady maralade10 Entertain' us11 el de tango roxanne12 I will always love you13 Zidler's rap14 Satine's musical theme15 A fool to belaive16 Chours final17 Smells like teen spritFiona
2,"Good music, bad soundtrack","You may look at the rating and get the wrong impression -- that I dislike the music in Moulin Rouge. That's not true, the music is great. However, the songs are meant to go with the movie -- without visuals, they're empty. Go pick up the DVD for a better experience"
1,"Skip the soundtrack, buy the DVD!","Already owning the DVD and being an absolutely spectacular spectacular fan of the movie, I anxiously awaited the arrival of the soundtrack. What a stinker! The other reviews warning that what you hear in the movie is NOT what you get on this soundtrack ARE ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Buyer beware. Case in point: the splendid ""Come What May"" sequence in the movie is reduced on the soundtrack to Donny & Marie styled drabble. You won't recognize ""Nature Boy."" The CD will gather dust in my collection -- I'm just going to keep playing the DVD! Whatever happened to the days when Hollywood would release ""original soundtrack albums""?"
3,"Good, despite it's flaws","A soundtrack for a musical should have the pieces which drive the narrative, and this ""soundtrack"" fails in that regard. All of the background music pieces which most people won't even remember from the film are included, but many of the pieces which actually told part of the story are left out.Some of the pieces which are included that were actually a part of the musical itself have been altered, but usually with good reason. ""Come What May"", for instance, in the movie, is broken up by frequent cuts to dialogue and other action, and presenting it as it was in the film would have been a little confusing.Despite its notable failures, I've still listened to the CD quite a bit, not having a better option, and it is still quite good. Just disappointing that it's not as good as it could and should have been."
2,"Well, 1 out of 10 ain't bad!","There is really no reason to purchase this CD other than the fantastic Beck cover of David Bowie's Diamond Dogs. Otherwise, look elsewhere... listening to Nicole Kidman sing is like dragging your finger nails across a blackboard.Cheerio... it's your money!"
1,bad,Cant any of these people write their own music? The opening track is a bad cover of a bas song. . . Learn to write your own music
2,I Think I Missed Something.,"I don't want this to come off as bashing or trashing, I'm simply going to state an opinion. This is a horrible album, and an overproduced try at a soundtrack.First mistake:There is no definite feel to the album. It starts depressing and ends depressing, but in between it's filled with conflict. I know this sound very appealing, but it seems crass to me.The vocals are bad, and half the songs are downright painful to listen to.The one good song, ""Lady Marmalade,"" can be purchased in the dar surperior UK/Norway import single, which includes a nice variety of wonderful mixes.There is a time and a place for singing prostitutes, prancing lovers, and overzealous pimps, I believe. I'm just not sure I want to be there at the time."
1,so sad...,"christina aguilera's version of lady marmalade gets my vote for the worst song of 2001. not only do we have to hear christina's annoying vocals, we are also blessed with hearing such talentless yahoo's as mya, lil kim and pink. the rest of the cd is almost as bad as this song, but nothing could be as bad as anything christina aguilera has done."
2,MOULIN ROUGE IS GREEN AROUND THE EDGES,"First off ""Lady Marmalade"" by Labelle is better than this mix with Christina Aguilera, Lil Kim, etc. Nicole Kidmans voice is weak at best.The rest of this soundtrack is okay, not great. I do not know why this album is getting 5 star reviews?The highlight of this is Ewan MacGregors voice, he can sing.Other than that this CD is a bust, and shows after Billboard Debuting at No.5 last weeks falls to No.10 and sales are falling sharply....word is getting out.Though the movie (which I haven't seen) looks inviting and challenging, this soundtrack is weak, the only standout song is the ""Elephant Medley"" with Kidman and MacGregor singing love song mixes of Wings ""Silly Love Songs"", u2s ""Pride In the Name of Love"", Elton Johns ""Your Song"", etc....a cute mix.Other than that this is a miss."
3,Pop--ularized album,"i must say that i love this film. what creativity and ingenuity! ironic because hardly anything is new in the film. i was very happy to see another musical and hope that the musical genre gets out of its long hybernation. but, while i loved the film and the music in the film, i am not pleased with this album. if it is a soundtrack of the film, where are ""Like a virgin"" and other, including the hilarious medley in the elephant? why do we need Christina Aguillera and other modern pop artists who didn't contribute to the actual music in the film, but instead are put on there just to attract more of that crowd. i was impressed with baz luhrman, who in his previous two films has gone edgy, but am upset with the producers of this cd who have gone mainstream just to make a few extra bucks. i hope they enjoy their money because it is a loss in artistry."
1,One of the biggest messes I have ever heard,"I am a big fan of movie soundtracks. I either have bought almost every existing soundtrack on vinyl or CD or have heard them. I've been buying sondtrack albums since I was 14, and that was back in the 70s. However, upon listening to this particular collection of music, I was absolutely amazed that such a conglomeration of mixed-up trash could actually make its way to a feature film about the Moulin Rouge at the turn of the century. Some of the instrumental music from the film is inspired and different, and I would've liked to have seen more of the original songs like ""Come What May"", but the rest of the modern pop entries just do not fit into a musical, especially a ""period"" musical. I know a lot of people really like this kind of anachronistic stuff, but it simply does not work, and I just wish Hollywood would stop churning out this garbage."
4,Where did the songs go?!?!,"I must say I was rather disapointed when I first listened to the soundtrack. I could not believe that the CD did not contain ""Spectacular! Spectacular!"", ""Like a Virgin"", or ""The Show Must Go On"". This is not to say that the CD is bad. It is still a GREAT soundtrack, but I do hope that true Broadway style musical soundtrack is released also. I mean John Lenguizamo's plaintive ""Nature Boy"" from the movie is just SO different from David Bowie's and the CD also doesn't have the great intro speech that Ewan does before he belts out ""Your Song"". If any of the recording execs are reading this...PLEASE RELEASE A FULL MOVIE SOUNDTRACK!! But until they do, buy the soundtrack that is out now, and watch Moulin Rouge as many times as you possibly can to get your fill of the other songs (^-^)."
4,"CD, like the movie, is magical...","I bought this CD shortly after seeing the film back in May, because I was absolutely amazed by the colors, the singing, the dancing...it took my breath away. I can't imagine that it didn't do well with critics...so much imagination went into compiling these songs! What other musical can you listen to and already know the words?The only comlaints I have of this CD (and the movie) is that there were not more duets and solos by Ewan and Nicole...the tracks of them singing are the highlights of Moulin Rouge. Some of the songs I could do without (the Gloria Estefan song) and I REALLY wish they would have used John Leguizamo's version of 'Nature Boy'...this just wasn't a David Bowie kind of tune. The Fat Boy Slim song is also great if you're a fan of his...it really gets in to your head!Overall, this is a very entertaining CD, especially if you've seen the movie and don't want it to end!"
4,A must-have album if you loved the movie,"""Moulin Rouge"" was one of the very rare movies out of hundreds I've seen that brought me back to the theatre to see it again the very next night. The CD is a must, although it, of course, does not have the visual banquet of the film. Disappointing are two songs missing, especially the take-off on ""Like A Virgin."" They were seriously warped for not including the funniest satire of the entire film (Madonna, if you had anything to do with blocking that release, shame on you!)."
4,I would buy the movie but not the soundtrack,"If you're interested in finding the songs you heard from the movie on this soundtrack, you're in for a disappointment. I wanted to give the soundtrack a rating of 3.5, but I decided to round up. Although it did include ""Your Song"" and ""Elephant Love Medley"" it didn't include movie favorites such as ""Spectacular Spectacular."" I wanted to hear all of the songs. Hopefully a second volume will be released, but who knows?... Nicole Kidman comes out as an adequate singer, but who knew Ewan had it in him to be such a crooner? The songs bring a smile to my face and makes me think of his twinkling eyes. So, basically buy the soundtrack if you must, but really, just buy the DVD when it comes out."
1,the real songs: most wanted,"after seeing this movie and thinking that the music was the best part about it, i almost cried when seeing the track list on this CD. What ever happened to this movie bringing back the movie musical when they don't even release the actual songs? personally, the show must go on was my favorite number and i thought a pivotal point in the movie, and they didn't include it? i am sorry the bottom line is they butchered the soundtrack."
3,The pop influence strikes again....,"I saw the movie first, and I was really hyped to see the soundtrack, as I loved most of the songs done in it.Then I saw the track listing. I loved all the music done by the actual CAST of the movie, that actually pertained to the PLOT, actually had something to do with the MOVIE.Had the cd contained more of the cast's songs and less songs thrown in there, I would have given this cd as many stars as I could.Alas, it gets only three."
4,More songs=More sountrack,"Okay, there was so much that they could have done with this, yet so many great songs are absent, like the remixed, intercut, Smells like teen spirit and Lady marmalad, and the sound of music (freedom, beauty, truth and LOVE) Baz, pop out another one, and you will make as much, or more, money... and the fans will buy it too."
4,I love Baz Lurhmann's Work,"This is a great CD!! Even though I can't stand Lil' Kim, Pink, Christina, & Mya, I do like ""Lady Marmalade"" a lot. But, I'm upset the CD doesn't have ""Like a Virgin"", ""Zidler's Rap"" and ""The Show Must Go On"". I was laughing so hard when Zidler was singing ""Like a Virgin"". Hopefully, they'll do a second volume--like what they did w/ the ""Romeo + Juliet"" soundtrack."
4,Great Soundtrack,"Fun covers of some classic tunes. Minus one star for not including the amazing ""Like a Virgin"" from the movie."
2,Why discard the original soundtrack???,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this CD: this soundtrack is not the real soundtrack you can expect from this incredible musical movie. There a some great songs that was not included (who can forgot the great version of ""Like a Virgin"" with the Duke and Harold Zidler???). Anyway, the CD is ok since includes ""Come what may"" and ""Elephant Love Medley"", but if you're a real fan of the movie, wait to the DVD version and hear the music from it, or wait for a new real ""soundtrack"" realease!!"
4,SURPRISINGLY FRESH,"I was extremely impressed with both Nicole Kidman's and Ewan McGregor's vocal talents as well as the different yet tasteful new spins on some old favorite songs. The orchestra in the movie songs is wonderful, and 'Lady Marmolade' is also a big plus. I definitely recommend this soundtrack."
4,The Music That Made The Film - Moulin Rouge Soundtrack,For those who have seen the movie listening to the cd is most enjoyable. From fat boy slims dance track (if you can can) to the romantic medley sung by nicole kidman and ewen McGreggor listening to the cd lets you relive the colour and atmosphere of the movie. A personal favourite of mine on the cd is 'Roxanne' i loved it because of its overwhelming power!!! The only reason i have for degrading the soundtrack one star is because some songs you have to be in the right mood to enjoy. But overall i loved the soundtrack as much as i did the movie......which is saying something!
2,What happened to the REAL soundtrack? Where is it?,"So much of the music that made this movie GREAT is not even on the CD. Where's Like a Virgin? Spectacular Spectacular? What happened here? All these pop versions are fine as ADDITIONAL tracks but do not function as a substitute for the real thing, and that's exactly what's missing. I sincerely hope that a complete soundtrack is coming soon."
1,Where are the songs from the Movie?,"I loved this movie and so I went out to buy the CD, and I was so disappointed when my favorite song wasn't even on there. Ther were so many other songs I could not care less about and that were not even in the movie. So I went on line to get the ""original soundtrack"" and when I looked up the songs on both, the songs That I wanted to hear were not on either one. I wanted to take the CD I purchased back to the store I was so mad. Niether of these CD's are ""soundtracks from the movie. Niether of them have the real songs from the movie on them. Do not waste you money. It is NOT the sound track from the movie at all. Never even hear of alot of the songs!!!"
3,Real soundtrack??,"I LOVE Moulin Rouge...I really do. And, don't get me wrong, this is a fine cd. However, like many others, I was really disappointed to hear songs that were changed or re-recorded for the cd. My favorite part of any song is in El Tango de Roxanne, where Ewan McGregor sings ""you're free to leave me but just don't deceive me..."" the second time. However...this was cut from the song. It was a powerful moment people!!! Though, as far as the songs sung by the original cast goes, it was a fairly good album."
1,....,"When you buy a CD from a musical you would expect the songs on that sound track to be similar to the ones in the movie. This is not the case of this soundtrack. First, some of the songs that were in the movie were abruptly cut and put back together. (For example sparkling Diamonds). Also many of the songs were not the versions heard in the movie. The notes that were sung in the first and last song of the movie are not even close to the notes that are being sung on the soundtrack. This is true for many of the songs on this soundtrack. There are also songs from the movie that are not on the soundtrack. If you are looking for the actual songs that you heard when seeing this movie I would not recomend this CD for you, because that is not what you are getting."
1,*SOB*,"i was SO disappointed with this CD! the music in the movie is AMAZING, and the few songs that are ACUALLY ON THE CD are totally different!i had really really been hoping they would have the song that nicole and evan sing, when she is with the duke, (about to do it with him) and she is looking down from the balcony and holding on to the railing, singing a beautiful song a looking at evan as he walks out of moulin rouge w/ his cute little scarf about his neck, and he is singing too, but a totally different song at the same time. and the two songs where SO BEAUTIFUL together, that i cried. i was so disapointed when it wasn't on the CD. and the ones that WERE on the CD, wheren't even the same as the movie.:-("
3,Not quite as complete of a soundtrack as I would like to be.,"If you are hoping that the whole score and all the musical numbers are found in the collector's edition, you will be disappointed. First, the tracks are not ordered in the manner as they occurred in the film. Song bits from the ""Sound of Music"" and from the Green Fairy are missing. You don't get the film version (which sounds way better!) of ""Your Song"" or ""Children of the Revolution"" on either disc. ""El Tango de Roxanne"" would've been better if the intro dialogue was included. I personally would've liked the soundtrack collection to include some of the notable lines/quotes from the movie as supplemental tracks. The collection is good, but you aren't getting everything that you hope to. My solution to this problem, buy the dvd, capture the songs to your computer, and create your own soundtrack! I created my own ""soundtrack"" (for my own use) and it's better than the collector's edition could ever be!"
2,where is the REAL soundtrack?,"don't get me wrong, on its own this is a fine enough album. BUT, it's missing some of the best numbers in the film, and i'd much rather hear John Leguizamo sing ""nature boy"" (as he did in the film) instead of the faux-coolness of David Bowie. where is ""like a virgin?"" where is ""spectacular spectacular?"" and where is ""zidler's rap?"" i hope they release a CD that plays ALL the music & songs from the movie, in their proper order. meanwhile, this album only makes me hunger for the songs it's missing."
2,Disappointing pop version of a fantastic soundtrack,"I thought Moulin Rouge was a fantastic film, in large part because of its very inventive soundtrack. Unfortunately, much of the brilliance of that soundtrack is burried under pop renditions which diminish the character of the original motion picture versions. The tracks which most closely preserve the original presentation (""Because We Can,"" ""Your Song,"" ""Elephant Love Medley,"" ""El Tango De Roxanne,"" and ""Hindi Sad Diamonds"") also inherit the movie's emotion and power. I wish the rest of the disc were as true to the original."
5,Fallen In Love With This Soundtrack!,"Ever since I bought this soundtrack, it's been in my cd player for at least four days out of the week. It brings beautiful music from the beginning, when Christian and Satine first fall in love, and some from the Show in the end of the film. I was a little disappointed that it, and its sister, Moulin Rouge 2, didn't contain the small song Satine sings when Harold tells her she musn't see Christian anymore (""If I should die this very moment..""), or the Green Fairy's number, but it's a good soundtrack anyway. Looking forward to Moulin Rouge 3.. they have enough music for it."
4,Unique kind of musical,"Moulin Rouge is something out of the ordinary, many films do not have these wonderful ways of making a musical/movie.The Soundtrack to Moulin Rouge is outstanding the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman make this CD worth listening to. The singles ""Come What May"" and ""Elephant Love Medley"" show the chemistry between Nicole and Ewan. This soundtrack is one of the best. Although, I was disappointed that ""Like a Virgin"" sung by Jim Broadbent was not accompained on this soundtrack. I still found mostly all the songs to be spectacular.If you have seen Moulin Rouge, you'll have to go out and get the soundtrack. Its great, unique and they arent many out there like that. And aren't many people in the mood for something new? If you are check out the movie Moulin Rouge and of course its Soundtrack."
3,Lady Marmelade is the only dancable piece,"The rest is just noise.just noise, just noise just noise, just noise, just noise, just noise, just noise, just noise"
5,The best soundtrack ive heard in ages.,"The Moulin rouge soundtrack, is the best one ive heard in ages! its got a wide selection of music types and some fantastic covers of the classics! a great buy!"
5,"Awesome, This Movie is Gonna Rock!","The first time saw the preview for this movie I knew I had to get the Cd. And I wasnted dissapointed, I watched the making of the movie on HBO, and I heard more of the music and I was impressed. All the songs are great, who would have thought Nicole Kidman or Ewan McGregor could sing. Awesome go get it its great you wont be dissapointed."
2,An Unfaithful Soundtrack,"Potential buyers should note that this is ""Music from..."", not a soundtrack per se. This is an important distinction, because if you loved the 2001 movie and want to relive the excitement you will find this an unworthy addition to your collection. Some of the orchestral numbers are here, yes, but some of the earlier songs switch performers from the movie cast. David Bowie is nice, but I want to hear John Leguizamo (Toulouse) perform ""Nature Boy."" The omission of the ""Like a Virgin"" cover in particular is almost criminal. What we get in return are remixed style covers and cuts that were not in the original film.Be certain that this is what you want before you buy. If you want the movie experience, you may be better looking elsewhere."
5,Moulin Rouge - Soundtrack,"If you liked the movie, then this is definitely a CD you want to add to your collection. Each track will take you back into the movie and it's a great reliving experience of the wonderful and complex scenes of the movie. The sounds are upbeat and will make you feel good. Great CD. And if you have this one, you do not need to get Soundtrack 2 - too many repeats."
5,One Word: Spectacular!!,"I'm a 14 years old fan of Moulin Rouge. I really love this movie, it's my favorite one, I've seen it almost 30 times! I'm serious.I love the music on it, it's really awsome, I love how they have mixed old songs with new ones, it sounds really amazing. This is my favorite soundtrack of all. Nicole Kidman (who, by the way is my favorite, favorite actress) sings really really good, I love her voice, it's really natural. And Ewan has a beautiful beautiful voice; together they are just perfect!"
2,Missing Something...,I thought I wanted to see the film. Nicole looked sooooo good in the trailers for it. I bought the soundtrack (it was one of 12 for a penny ;) It has moments. It has dialoguish-sounding stuff way too mushy for my tastes. Some of the music seems catchy and cool...some consists of gratingly butchered popular tunes. I haven't quite decided if I really like it or not yet...but it makes a poor advertisement for the film. I'll probably wait for it to come out highly edited on FOX some night. The soundtrack might wind up for sale on a card table on my front lawn.
1,Moulin Rouge (Soundtrack),"The movie was spectacular for its sound, among other things, so this supposed ""soundtrack"" CD is a tremendous disappointment. The sound mixing is atrocious; the singing of Nicole Kidman and her leading man is overwhelmed by the orchestra. Each track has different sound levels, requiring one to change the volume constantly. The opening song in the movie, which is a stunning rendition of ""Nature Boy,"" is sung by a different singer on the CD, a major disappointment. (How CAN this be called a soundtrack, then?) And one can only wonder why some of the best music of the movie wasn't chosen to be included! Save your money. I wish I had!"
2,"Uh...Yeah, right.","This album has ONE good song on it. The cover of Lady Marmalade is the only decent song. The rest are utterly unbearable. They are sang by actors. Why? Actors are actors for a reason. They are good at playing a part, not singing. Most of the songs sounded like you were in an opera somewhere. That just isn't me. If you like that sort of music, you may want to buy this. Otherwise don't waste the money. Just go out and try to find a single of Lady Marmalade."
2,Would rather have more of the REAL music from the movie!,"Where is the song ""The Show Must Go On""? The movie uses the fantastic song by Queen, but it's not on the soundtrack. And the Lady Marmalade remake is a joke. Sure the actual words didn't quite fit the movie, but did you have to use Christina? Ugh."
3,One Day I'll Fly Away WELL Re-worked,"Soundtracks in general have been getting better in recent years. I like this soundtrack, although do not love it. Biggest surprise is Nicole Kidman singing 'One Day I'll Fly Away' which is co capturing. Ewan singing 'Your Song' is a nice rendition of Elton's masterpiece. Like all soundtracks, there are a couple of fillers which didnt need to be included (particularly when there were other songs from the movie they could have used), but a perfect CD doesnt exist in this world. Worth owning for the tributes alone."
4,Better than the movie!!,"The soundtrack to Moulin Rouge is really good. For some reason I like the music a whole lot better than the movie. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor do a really good job singing as far as just being actors go. This Musical really has great songs in it, it takes a whole bunch of older songs like ""In the Name of LOve"" by U2 and ""Diamonds are a girls best friend"". Even though the music is outstanding I only reccommend the soundtrack. This soundtrack is outstanding"
5,Great Soundtrack,"The cdking really got it right in the song-by-song review. This is a great CD, especially if you loved the movie. Many of the songs on here are better than their original versions. MacGregor does a better job than Elton John on ""Your Song,"" in my opinion, giving it a new life. ""Elephant Love Medley"" is impossible not to sing along to. Rufus Wainwright gives us a beautiful, elegantly-sung ""Confessions de la Butte."" I didn't think that too much was left out, unlike others, because the key music is all here. I highly reccommend this, especially if you are open to new renditions of great music."
3,Lost Without Scenery,"Yes, the soundtrack is great, but it left me nostalgic for the movie. I'd recommend purchasing the movie instead. Sound without sight doesn't work for Moulin Rouge."
4,an interesting mix and concept,"Prior to Moulin Rogue I didn't know there was a series of film called ""red curtain"" where, moulin rouge is the third of said series. The first being ROMEO+JULIET and the second one STRICTLY BALLROOM.I found the music to Moulin Rouge pretty eclectic, fresh and inventive. Though the film itself is set in the late 1800's, the music they used on the film is undoubtebly 70's, Very brave, very wise, very visionary. How else could you have made a movie where most of the people can understand the lyrics of the songs their singing. I mean, these are songs you grew up on.Noteworthy tracks include FatboySlim's can can song, Lady Marmalade, and nicole doing someday I'll fly away. Critics don't get me wrong, it is not amazing that she can sing, its amazing that she is able to. Just for that is worth the price of admission.I can't wait to see the film if it lives up to the music."
4,Fantastic music! :-) Incomplete soundtrack. :-(,"First of all, the movie rocks and the music in it is just fantastic. Wonderful blend of pop, rock and modern musical with a touch of the drama of the classic opera. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are surprisingly fantastic.However, the soundtrack is incomplete. The songs are all remixes of what you hear in the movie, which are fun, but they drop a lot of the cool stuff unique to the movie. (i.e. Lady Marmalade is the version you can get everywhere and not the one with Harold Zidler's voice over) The other problem is it's missing a lot of great songs (""Like a Virgin"" and ""The Show Must Go On"") aren't even on it. Many of the songs that are sung several times in the movie in different ways (""Come What May"", ""Fly Away"") are on the CD in an attempt of a mix, but again, you loose a lot of cool moments.Overall, the CD was fun, but it would be nice to be able to get one complete with the movie version of the songs and all the reprises."
4,Spectacular! Spectacular!,"I LOVE this movie. I LOVE this soundtrack. I have seen the movie twice now, and I must agree that people either love it or hate it, a fact which was proven when some people walked out after the revamp of ""Heroes"" (and shouting a few choice words in the process), and everyone who remained stayed glued to the screen up to the flashing of TRUTH, BEAUTY, FREEDOM, but above all LOVE. What a powerful, moving expierence this film is. There is only one dissappointment I have in the actual soundtrack... I want more! Where is the ""Smells like Teen Spirit"", or ""Like a Virgin""? Where is the music from the Red Room scene and the very humorous Sound of Music? Please, please, let there be an album titled ""MORE Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film MOULIN ROUGE!"""
4,An Excellent Soundtrack! One of the best!,"The soundtrack to this summer's hit movie, ""Moulin Rouge"", is a CD that I never let out of my sight. All of the songs on the CD made the movie what it is. My favorite songs are the few sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, who both have extrodinary voices. ""Lady Marmalade"" -- sung by Christina, Pink, Lil' Kim, and Mya -- is one in a million. You do not hear a song like that on the soundtrack of every movie. At all costs, listen to this CD. A favorite of mine, it could soon be on of yours."
2,not good,"I listened to this whole thing and I didn't like anything except the famous 'Lady Marmalade'. I thought for sure there would be something more than that, but no. The two stars I gave this was for the one song that I loved from here and that's it. Try to get the single of Lady Marmalade if you like it and don't make the mistake of buying the whole CD like I did."
5,Moulin Rouge Soundtrack,"It was.......Spectacular, Spectacular! Nicole and Ewan's on-screen chemistry, captivating performance, and heartstopping vocal talents were awesome. I listened to the cd two times before the movie came out and feel even more in love with the cd thereafter. I have seen the movie twice and will probably go a few more times. My only complaint is that i am left hungry for the rest of the music to be released!!!!!! This future DVD release will be certain to become my all time favorite!"
4,"great music, but you want more","Moulin Rouge is one of those all around great films. Being an actor myself and very artistic, the movie appealed to me in more ways than one. Personally, though, I hate musicals, and while watching them They all seemed to have this corniness that makes me wish i was having a root canal done. Mouling Rouge is an entirely different story though. The soundtrack is spectacular (minus the ""Lady Marmalade"" song, I don't like Christina and company). The soundtrack gives me chills just listening to it, and there is only one problem with it: it is incomplete! I was very dissapointed to see that a lot of the films songs were cut out. Maybe the company that produced this CD will release another CD with the remaining tracks on it, or they could just cut out the ""Lady Marmalade"" track and add a few more songs. Until then, this CD is great and I highly recommend it!"
1,Please buy the DVD,"This CD does do exactly what a movie soundtrack should do - it displays all the songs from the motion picture to give you a vague idea of the story of the film. The film is absolutely incredible and never fails to entertain. However there is another thing from the film which this cd highlights - Nicole Kidman's raspy, thin, 'nothing' of a voice. Quite frankly i would have preferred a dub than to have her strain her vocal cords down a speaker at me! I am afraid to say that not even the magically rich scores of music which accompany her can hide the fact that she just can't sing! Ewan Macgregor does pull-off the role of Christian however, his high tenor voice is actually too bad. As my titel says, it is absolutely essential to buy the DVD instead of this cd."
5,moulin rouge is amazing,ewen mcgregor and nicole kidman are amazing in this soundtrack. It would be well worth the money to have this.
5,Wonderful!!,"I read these reviews before deciding if I wanted to buy the soundtrack to this absolutely enchanting movie! I must say I was a bit discouraged by such negative comments but I was not discouraged enough! I bought the CD the following day and I absolutely love it! All of the songs are on the movie--whether part of the backround music or the actual songs sung by Ewan and Nicole. Yes, some songs are not included but the songs that are included are great. Hopefully, the second CD will contain the missing songs. So I recommend this soundtrack to anyone who loved the movie and absolutely loved the music! My favorite track is El Tango De Roxanne! Such emotion!"
2,Somewhat Disappointed,Ok. Now I was 100 percent impressed with the movie and I just KNOW someone out here is going to READ my REVIEW but the soundtrack disappointed me. Now I didn't buy the soundtrack through Amazon.com and the titles showing ARE NOT what they appeared on the One I bought in the stores so I might be mistaken here.The reason I rushed out immeadiately to buy the albumn is this. They sang the Show Must Go On JUST AS GOOD as the Original Artists. I was soooooo impressed. Most people who redo a Queen song screw it up BIG time.I am a HUGE Queen fan and to here it in it's entirety impressed me completely. I loved it. And I am soooo disappointed that they didn't include that song on the albumn.It gave the picture more impact. Especially since Freddie Mercury must have known that he had HIV or even AIDS at the tim ehe wrote and recorded it.The music is good but a disapponntment because it would include something like Diamond Dogs on it but not include the Show Must Go On.
3,Disappointing...,"I was floored by the movie ""Moulin Rouge"" and quickly went out to purchase the soundtrack. Imagine my dissappointment when many of the wonderful songs from the movie were missing from it. In their place were frivolous versions sung by stars who never even graced the flashy ""Moulin Rouge"" in the picture. The songs that are performed by the cast, however, are real gems, and make the CD worth the money spent on it."
4,"Brilliant,sparkling but one song missing !","Saw the movie yesterday, bought the soundtrack today. However when I 'm reading these reviews nobody seems to be missing ""Gorecki "" from Lamb. Am I really the only one that likes this song ?"
4,MOULIN ROUGE!,"I loved this movie, probably the best musical of all-time. I bought the soundtrack before seeing the movie cause I had heard Lady Marmalade before. So I got it listened to it over and over. Then saw the movie. I was extremely disaponted at the lack of songs on the cd. I heard Baz is in the owrks on a 2 CD soundtrack featuring the missing songs. I hope it comes out I will snatch it up as soon as it comes out. But I'm sure more people would have bought it if ""Spectacular,Spectacular"", ""The sound of Music"", ""The Can-can Mix/Zidler's Rap"" ""The Show Must Go on"", ""Nature Boy"" (by John Leguizamo) and ""Come What May"" (movie version) were on it. Those are the best songs from the movie. ""Because we Can"" gets annoying after listening to it so long, and I loved it when they mixed MARMALADE, and Smells Like Teen Spirit into it."
4,really really really love it!,"i had seen the movie three times, and then bought the cd. i fell in love with both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. ""elephant love medley"" and ""come what may"" are so wonderful. i love it when both of them sing together. and ""one day i'll fly away"" and ""el tango de roxanne"" are just the kind of songs that stick in your head forever. i also loved the ""spectacular spectacular""song, ""like a virgin"" and ""the show must go on"", which did not appear in the cd. i think it would be nice to include a few lines from the movie in each track. it'll be easier to get into the songs and understand them that way. like, ""spectacular spectacular"" would sound hilarious if all the lines of the duke are included. i wish the soundtracks will remind me of the scenes in the movie."
5,wow,what a soundtrack I love it.....better than romeo & juliet ...the roxanne track is just unbelievable and ewan mcgregor has the sexiest voice in the world I still have it on repeat 2 weeks later!
3,WHERE ARE THE MISSING SONGS?,"Okay, if you want to read about how great the movie was or how great the music on this soundtrack, find another review. Don't get me wrong, I think both are excellent, but this soundtrack is MISSING SONGS!! Where is the opening scene in the dance hall, the mix of Lady Marmalade/Becase We Can/Smells Like Teen Spirit and more? Where is the ""Spectacular Spectacular"" song when they're convincing the duke to endorse the play in the elephant? Where is Like a Virgin? The songs on here are okay, but three of the songs that MADE the movie are glaringly absent. A second soundtrack better be coming soon."
4,Exhilirating,"This soundtrack wonderfully captures the feeling and spirit of this fabulous movie, and I can certainly recommend it highly. It is a little disappointing that several good tracks from the movie weren't included, but if you don't have the DVD you have to have this soundtrack. Ewan McG. is just wonderful..."
4,Only one BUT,"amazing film!amazing cast!amazing songs!BUT, where are this songs?:-Like a virgin-So exciting!It will last for 50 years-The show must go onI think there is also another one missing.Well, that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because apart from that,it has all the songs as featured in the film."
5,Fabulous!,"With this soundtrack you can relive every moment of a brilliant movie. Every track brings back exciting visual memories and more because some tracks such as ""Diamond Dogs"" which were not played in their entirety in the movie, are brilliantly played in full-length versions. This is a must for every fan of the movie."
2,Half Okay - Half Excellent!,"One of the things I dislike most about soundtracks for movies is when you go to see a movies and there is very little what was in the movie and more of the new songs or new version of songs a studio is trying to push.Hald of this album is like that. FIlled with the cover songs or remixes of the music that was NOT in the film or layed down as part of the original soundtrack. That is very anoying.However, the second half...the FOUR songs that were actually in the film - especially ""The Elephant Melody"" are wonderful. I was so disappointed in this CD when I got it that I almost wrote the studio asking ""Why?"" If you liked the pop stuff they have been playing on the radio - you'll love this CD - if you are looking for what was actually in the movie - you'll only find FOUR true cuts - and/or cues.But, guess hwat? They released another CD....now read that review I have written!"
4,Almost Captures the Magic of the Movie,"Most of the songs are exactly like the versions sung in the film (""Hindi Sad Diamonds"", ""Your Song"", ""El Tango de Roxanne""). Some songs are better than the film versions with pop stars participating like the huge hit ""Lady Marmalade"". The only problem I had was with ""Come What May"" because instead of the dramatic, touching finale that it was in the film, they went with full blown production and turned it into a run-of-the-mill duet. This soundtrack is good as a companion to the movie not a replacement. The music in the film is the most exciting because of the story, acting, setting, etc. that goes along with it while you're watching the movie."
4,Everybody can can!,"Moulin Rouge was a quirky movie that you either absolutely love, or absolutely hate, and this soundtrack seems to be just the same. As for me, I do love the album. True, some of the songs are better than others - strangely enough I disliked the remake of Lady Marmalade, which was one of the most popular songs of the soundtrack!For me, the songs that really caught my attention had the most power, including Because We Can, Sparkling Diamonds, Children Of The Revolution, Diamond Dogs, and Hindi Sad Diamonds. Strangely, though, my absolutely favorite is Complaite De La Butte, which is terribly touching.What can I say? I do like the album - it's not perfect, but it's still very good!(Review of Moulin Rouge [soundtrack])"
4,Very Pleasing...,Highlights are:Lady MarmaladeSparkling DiamondsRhythm of the NightOne Day i'll Fly AwayYour SongElephant Love MedleyCome What MayHindi Sad DiamondsComplainte De ButteAlthough is does get a little tiring if you listen to it too much.
5,Nicole Becomes Great Singer!!!,Absolutely!!! This is definetly an album worth buying. Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are very talented singers and other songs as Rhythm of the Night and Lady Marmalade make this soundtrack a SMASH HIT!!! Whoever likes musicals will fall in love with this soudtrack. This is definetly the one to own. If It's one soundtrack to buy this summer make it Moulin Rouge. It will take you on a joy ride.
3,Moulin Rouge,"Well.... Though I really enjoy some of the songs on this soundtrack others do not capture the same intensity you feel in the movie or in the entire soundtrack. It was a disapointment to see the songs such as Come One May and Your Song taken down by ...Because we can etc. I also believe that some of the movies best songs were left out. While I was not overly impressed with the quality of the soundtrack, i do enjoy listening to it from time to time."
2,Not enough of the actual soundtrack...,"This probably should have also been released in a ""movie"" version as well, so people could buy the cheesy pop version as well as the real soundtrack. I was more than horribly dissapointed that the CD didn't include the powerful rendition of Queen's ""Show Must Go On.""What a shame."
5,Technical exercises for children,"This is a great little book of technical exercises for children learning the piano. I find it perfect from age 7 upwards, but smaller children do not have the reach or strength for it.I find the exercises useful for my own warmups, so you can use this for many years.The exercises are given names to appeal to the children, with little matchstick men illustrations to go along with them. You begin with walking, move to running, skipping, jumping etc.I joke with the kids ""I want you to do cartwheels and headstands on the piano this week, but don't let your mom catch you!"" Always gets a laugh.Highly recommended for kids learning the piano."
1,Does NOT fit Husqvarna 33,"Despite what the application information says, this bar and chain does NOT fit the Husqvarna 33. The correct combo for that chain saw is P/N 108579."
1,Do not buy these,i bought these rotors in late march and 2700 miles later they are warped and need to be replaced. this was a terrible choice I made trying to save a buck...
5,not just for kids,"I admit to being age 65 and love fairy tales, Candyland, etc., which I played with my three daughters (all grown now).I got Candyland in a Cheerios Box and sent it to my granddaughter then bought another box and tried it myself. I really love it as a relaxer and building the ice cream sundaes is FUN!You are never too old!"
5,wonderful color learning game,"I bought this for my 4 year old. He knows his colors, but was new to the computer. He would play this game 24/7 if I allowed it (which I don't). We also have the board game which he also loves. Great game for a great price."
1,Not as expected,Game was not as expected. have seen a much better version elsewhere. Shipping was adequate but game would not stay on and kept causing error screens during half hour time used. Cannot use
4,Candyland comes alive!,"My girls (...) always want to play the board game Candyland - there are just not enough hours in the day for mom to play all the time with them...so, this is the perfect alternative! In fact, they prefer the computer game to the board game now.The Candyland game comes to life! The different places have different areas to click & play for as long as you choose, then back to the game! Lord Licorice is ticklish & afraid of the dark-try visiting him! The kids learn to recognize their colors and learn some matching skills as well. And it's just plain fun!I recommend this for ages 3 & up.1smileycat :-)"
3,Nice Game but very slow!!,"I am not sure why, but with my HP Pavilion Pentium III, this game runs so slow. It is really aggravating. My 4-year-old still likes the game, but he gets antsy waiting for the game to catch up to his keystrokes. This is the only game we have that acts this way. Maybe it is the real time media on the cd that it has to keep accessing. If anyone has any suggestions as to why this is so slow, please write them in the reviews. Thanks."
4,Channel Zero,"Hey. This album was recorded by Channel Zero. Channel Zero was a Belgian metal band. WAS, because a couple of years ago, they decided to call it quits. This was because they didn't sell enough records in the US. Why not? I still don't understand. All their albums were really good. This one 'Stigmatized for Life' is a real good one too. With scorchers as 'America' on this cd, I still don't understand why this band never made it big in the US. If you like bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Body Count, Sepultura (just to name a few), you can't go wrong with any Channel Zero record."
3,Very basic program,"The program is put together well and it is fun to use. However, when it said it was for beginners, it wasn't kidding. I didn't know that there would be so few words on it. I don't think I'll even be able to say an entire sentence. This is a great product if you want to learn the basics before you go on vacation, but it is not a good product if you truly want to become fluent in Swahili."
2,nothing special,"This album suffers from the fact that there are few stand out tracks, the sounds are often too dated to even be considered ""retro"" and the mix has no sense of direction or progress. It's just an ill-conceived jumble of tracks and artists from the hard-edged Chicago house/tech scene. It's only real selling point is the fact that it's compiled and mixed by Robert Armani, but it comes off as hardly thought through, and rather disappointing. It's worth a listen if you are already a fan of RA and are keen to collect everything in his back catalogue, but it's a one shot album that I did not find myself going back to again and again. It's poor example of a style of music that is already a bit obscure and of limited appeal. I'd suggest trying RA's solo artist material if you are curious. Avoid this album unless you are buying it for your collection. It's really nothing special."
4,Good Work Shirt,"I needed to find good looking shirts that I would not care that much about. I work as IT support for a company that requires a minimum of business casual. Well for a desk job that isn't that bad; but since I'm crawling on floors and dealing with dusty equipment, I didn't want to spend too much on shirts that will be ruined. These shirts have held up nicely.I have had buttons pop off of each of my shirts at this point. It is annoying but I've been able to save all the buttons and resew them on. The buttons themselves are of good quality and the shirts are holding up nicely, it is just the stitching done to hold the buttons that seems awful.For the price of $5 a shirt, I cannot complain and these shirts work well. They look nice but if I stain or damage the shirts I don't care and I need that for my job.I recommend these polos for every day work use but for when you need to dress up get other shirts."
2,Buttons came off after two washings,The buttons on the shirt were not sewn on very securely. I've had to reattach them a few times now. But I guess you get what you pay for.
3,Quality and price consistant,"These shirts are light weight material and of decent, but not good quality. The price was very low, and so I am satisfied. Be aware, they tend to run a little large."
3,Cheap and Regular Shirt,"These shirts are too light weight material, but not good quality. The price was very low. I look better shirts for this price."
1,Suffers from one unforgiveable sin.,"The characters are all deeply flawed which often makes a character more interesting. But in this case, all of the characters are not only not interesting, they are completely unappealing. I couldn't muster any interest or any caring for any of these people.About half way through the book, I realized that I did not care whether or not Pendleton murdered poor Amber, and I wasn't in the least interested in who did, if he did not.From that part on, I skimmed til the end, and by that time, the story had become a mess.The worst mystery I've read in some time. Spare yourself some bucks and skip this one."
2,Death of a Reader,"I enjoy many types of stories, especially detective novels. Not sure what this book is trying to be but after about 100 pages I don't really care anymore. Way to descriptive. As stated in another review we do not need paragraph long sentences to describe a room someone is walking through. The concept and idea behind the story were interesting but I just couldn't find my way through all the meandering..."
1,It STINKS!!!,"Perhaps one needs to be the ""literary"" type to find this book interesting. And apparently I'm NOT one - because I found the book to be totally unreadable! I tried - but couldn't finish it. Most of the time even if I don't care for a book I do complete it because I want to see how it ends - I didn't EVEN care how this one ended - it simply NEVER ""grabbed"" ne. What a waster of money!"
3,Intriguing Mystery,"Death of a Writer: A Novel, is an intriguing mystery by author and runner Michael Collins. Set in a small, liberal arts college, professor E. Robert Pendleton is suffering from a severe case of writer's block and depression, which worsen when a rival arrives on campus as a guest lecturer. Completely despondent, Pendleton attempts suicide and fails. He is left catatonic and falls into the care of his nemesis and a graduate student, who find brilliant unpublished murder novel by Pendleton. But is the novel fiction, or the tale of a real murder?"
4,The Truth will Set You Free,Joel Goldsmith has been given a spiritual vision into living a life in Christ.There are many steps to take in the spiritual life and sometimes we take one step forward and two steps backward.There are days when all seems hopeless and your faith is waning and than you let go and let God and you reach the mountain top.To stay at peace in your journey takes work and yet this is a paradox because grace will see you through.
5,Joel Goldsmith's Spiritual Autobiography,"All students should read this book. Mr. Goldsmith considered this book his autobiography. The text comes from taped lectures Joel Goldsmith gave around the world, now available through the Infinite Way office in Perris, California. Particularly helpful are the chapters on the stages of spiritual development in the middle of the book. Be sure to read them.Visit the Infinite Way web site and find more resources for your study."
5,The Best,How blessed indeed we are to have these truths available to read and study. Thank you Joel Goldsmith!
4,It was a dark and stormy night...,"The classic boardgame has now moved to the computer. With all the mystery and suspense you knew and loved. The 3D graphics used with the game are excellent. The game can be played either viewing as the classic boardgame (overview), or as a three dimensional mansion.When a player makes a suggestion (e.g. Professor Plum with the knife in the library) the computer plays a simulated cut-scene of what that particular scenario might look like. With an added surround sound card and subwoofer these scenes are very suspenseful!The game can also be played solo, pitting you against two to five computer run players.This is a great classic game and highly recommended."
5,Its a Gas!,"I planned to give it to the Niece, but I keep playing it! When a character suggests a murder scenario, you see the dinner guest come after you with that weapon! You complete your 'scorecard' in colors so its a lot easier than the board game cards. If you dont have 3 people around, you play against novice or expert computer players. There's a slight delay after each player's move, but no more than kids around a coffee table. I cant stop Playing!"
1,How much fun is it to stay trapped in a room?,"Of the four reviews already written for this game, three complained about bugs. BELIEVE THEM. This is the most clunky game I've played in a long time. Here's what happens. When you enter a room, you can leave again, but if someone else enters the room and blocks the door you can't get past them. I've loaded it on three separate computers to see if the problem might be with the computer, but always the same problem. I have never been able to play for longer than 15 minutes without getting trapped. I love the board game, and I was excited about this adaptation, but it's not worth the time it will take you to install, get stuck, and uninstall it."
2,Unless you are patient don't bother!!,"I have been a huge Clue fan since I was little. I was so excited to see this cd-rom. The first game I played it froze in the middle. The next 6 attempts the same thing happened. I got very frustrated and went searching on the internet for the web pages listed on the manual. I downloaded the 'patch', rebooted my computer, this time the game lasted longer than the previous 7 attempts. Finally I turned everything that was running in the background on my computer, except for the two basic programs you need and the game ran fine for 6 games in a row. (I have to admit when it runs like it should it is fun.) The seventh game I was almost at the end of the game when it crashed the computer. No matter what I did the 'butler's voice' would only start working about 3 turns into the game. So unless you have the time to turn every program off everytime, don't waste your money- stick with the classic board version!!"
1,WORST GAME EVER,"Being a clue fan i thought why not? I read some of the reviews but thought well maybe they are not bug fans like me, well they were right i wouldn't take this game if you payed me. TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Clue Muder at Boddy Manison,"I LOVE THE MOVIE CLUE! I NEVER PLAYED TO BOARD GAME MUCH BECAUSE NO ONE IN MY FAMILY BUT ME LIKED CLUE! SO WHEN I SAW THIS CD VERSION I FLIPED AND BOUGHT IT ON THE THE SPOT BEFORE I READ ANY REVIEWS. WELL I AM SORRY FOR THAT NOW BEAUSE I CANT GET THE DARN THING TO LOAD PROPERLY AND I WONT LET ME UNINSTALL IT TO DO IT OVER. I GET TO THE BEGINING AND CLICK PLAY BUT IT KEEPSI SAYING ""CLUE.EXE."" NOT FOUND! WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN? THAN I CALLED THAT NUMBER THAT CAME WITH THE CD AND ITS BEEN DISSCONNETED! I AM RUNNING WINDOWS VISTA SO IT SHOULD WORK! I WILL TRY CALLING HASBRO AGAIN. NOW THIS IS NOT A BAD REVIEW FOR THE SELLER BECAUSE THEY WERE GREAT! I GOT MY CD NEW AND FAST AS PROMISED! I REALLY WANTED THIS TO WORK BECAUSE I LOVE CLUE HOPEFULL HASBRO WILL HAVE THE ANSWERS I NEED. IF YOU ARE NOT A PATIENT PERSON(I AM) DONT MAKE THIS PURCHASE. ITS LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A GOOD GAME IF I CAN JUST GET IT TO WORK!!!!!"
2,Just okay.,Kind of slow and kept locking up on me. Had to quit the game many times in the middle and restart.
2,Online Gaming,"The specs say that this game is playable online, however, the online function directs you to a page that is 404. If you are getting this game for online use I would not recomend this. If you are getting it just for personal fun or for use on a single computer, it may be a good investment."
5,I want one now!,"I bought this as a bridal shower gift, and now I want one. There are lots of great ideas in here - especially if you want to give gifts to people, but really can't afford to.Each recipe not only comes with a full colour photo, but also instructions as to how to package it. The ideas are inspiring, and easy to play with to personalize for the gift receiver.I think it makes a great shower gift - especially as newlyweds never have money, and have tons of people to give gifts to!"
5,great,"This book was definitly worth it. If you like champagne taste with a beer budget, this is the book for you. Great ideas and recipes. Incredible."
3,faucet design,The faucet was made very well with the exception of the bracket that holds the faucet to the countertop. When tightening the secure nut it bent and I had to improvise a makeshift washer and holder. Otherwise the faucet would turn if bumped. The materials themselves should last a long time and it is a simple faucet to utilize.
1,This book is crap-tacular!,"If my sock drawer was organized like this book...there would never be a matching pair of socks. The old socks and the new socks would cling together in a wad of static electricity, making it painful to dare try and pull them apart and match them up in any other way. The book lacks fabric softener, and reading it is itchy torture.But seriously...this book tries to be ""smart"" by organizing the chapters into ""subjects for art"",and it doesn't work.It's stupid!"
4,Boz is Boss,"This album is a must for Boz fans.I believe this was Boz's first solo effort after he split from the Steve Miller Band and one of his finest. Although Greg Allman is a featured guitarist, Boz sings the blues as only he can do. I was living in San Fransisco the fall of 1969 and KSAN played the title track several times a day but I'll tell ya, every track on this effort is classic Boz and a must own for the consumate fan. If you have heard and like ""Moments"", or any of the Boz's works, then you'll love this."
1,As advertised.,"Buy any other album but this one, old junk recycled. Does anyone know why they rereleased this one? I sure don't..."
4,Boz and Duane,"While I like the entire album, as it shows Boz Scaggs range - this album alone is worthy of 4 stars for Loan me a dime. If you have never heard it - buy it for this - the blues of the song will knock you out and Duane Allman's guitar rivals his work on Layla and The Filmore East albums. I am hoping everyone my age has heard it, but perhaps some of you who are my children's age -late teens and early twenties - might not have. This is worthy of being named to a list of top twenty songs of all time !"
2,"Ok for text, not for anything else","I have used this printer for about 1 1/2 years. I t has just completely shut off and will no longer work. It is a great printer if you only want to print e-mails or print text for school reports. I tried to get my money's worth and use it for photos, cd covers and labels, greeting cards, and transparencies. They printed and were usable, but there were lines in the color. The quality is not as good as other printers that I have used for the same projects. The transparencies and photos were the worse. If you tried to copy form a scanner, everything was blurred."
1,Arrived broken and never worked also very dirty and used,A very bad expierence for my first purchase. The printer arrived somewhat dirty and looked very used. It was a great waste of my time and effort and I still need a printer.
2,Bad printer,"My friend has this printer and he says its horrible! The print quality is awfull. Though, it's speed is fast, this is a horrible quality printer. Two of my friends on Compaq computers. One put it in the garage a year ago and has been happy with his new one. My other friend suffers from having one with Windows 98 (not to mention incredibly slow) and is going to get a new one soon. Compaq I guess is just a horrible company."
3,"Good Text, Bad Photo","This is a good cheap printer if your looking to print mostly text, but the color photos don't come out well at all."
2,Battery Dies,"I used to love the blender (two years ago). Fast clean up, easy set up, great for making mayo, hollandaise, whipped cream, soup... Then into hot water and soap, hit the blend and you're clean.But the battery dies and won't hold a charge. This is forseeable, but does Cuisinart offer spares/replacements at reasonable cost? Nooooooooo!Guess what? We'll buy a cheap corded model. We're disappointed. Every product has some limitations, but one should be able to use it for 3 years with no problem and replace failure-prone parts quickly, easily and at a good price, if desired.This product is just another example of bad business and we don't want to reward it."
2,Get one with a cord,"They still make this? I saw this listing while searching for a replacement for my Rechargeable Cuisnart which has died after a few years. Its nice in concept, but underpowered and you're out of luck when you burn through a charge. OK for lightweight jobs, in the long run you'll be much happier with a corded model."
2,"Doesn't keep a charge, and maintain a fast enough speed","It's not god awful, but the cheaper plug in one I have is easier to use, not as heavy and bulky, and gets the job done with out running out of steam."
2,Where are the replacement batteries?,"We have had the cordless blender for 3 years now, and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version, it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen. Clean up was a breeze, too. The worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery, which, withihn a year, took less and less of a charge after each use. Now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once. It does not surprise me that Cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately, which, in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence, but in turn, Cuisinart should not be surprised when I never buy another one."
1,"The ""convenience"" isn't convenient at all","Cuisinart's ad copy and product directions claim that the charger can be kept plugged into the wall so it's always ready for use. However, this is a nickel-cadmium rechargeable battery. Plugging it back in to recharge before you've fully drained it is DEATH to NiCad batteries! This stupid design decision on the part of Cuisinart almost guarantees a poor user experience."
2,Great product until it stopped working,"Had this indispensable item for less than two years when it died. Worked well one day; seemed to be recharging but was totally dead the next day. Three year warranty, but you have to pay postage both ways (they require you to send $7 with the defunct product)."
2,"Great idea, poor design","I like using this blender for smoothies and whipping cream. Its a little awkward to hold but was very handy as my old kitchen had few outlets. But after a few months its a hassle. Water, or some liquid has gotten into the shaft containing the blade - I can hear it when I shake it but I can't get it out. I'm wondering if whatever is up in there is getting into food. The plug for recharging the motor section jammed and will not fully extend, so to recharge I have to use an extension cord or that component just about falls out of the outlet. Frankly, I'm fed up with Cuisinart. I just moved and was surprised to be chucking a toaster and a coffee maker - both with little use. This hand blender will likely soon follow."
4,Not for people with short arms and small hands!,"This is a great product, but I should caution it is a little difficult to use if you are very petite and have short arms and tiny hands. It then becomes a little awkward to use and it takes some time learning to adjust. Great product for those who only use a blender occasionally, as it takes up very little space."
1,Waste of Money,"I was a little skeptical at first that a battery operated blender would have any amount of torque approaching an electric version...BUT I let all the rave reviews convince me otherwise, and after all it would be one less electric cord cluttering up my countertop.Well, I should have stuck with my first instinct. This device is next to useless...unless you are blending things you could easily blend with a spoon. An electric blender would cut through frozen bananas (in milk) easily...come on...alot of you do this to make shakes...this battery powered blender can's handle it. After cutting the banana into little chunks...then put up with 5 minutes slow blending... careful not to grind the device to a dead stop. If you think its too good to be true, it usually is !!!"
1,very disappointing,"I bought this blender primarily because it was cordless and would therefore be easier and safer to use. But its performance has been very disappointing. The battery does not hold a charge well; the motor dies after just a few seconds. It's hard to hold down the power button for very long. And the stick is just too tall; I have to hold my arms up too high over whatever I'm trying to blend. I bought this at full price ($75) a year ago, and it was a waste of money. I'm going out to buy another model that has a cord and is more comfortable to use."
3,Advance study,"I really wanted to learn more about the Book of Revelations, but this book was just too scholarly, I guess. I did learn a few things but much of it was lost on me. Instead I got Elaine Pagel's book, which is written more on my level (I do have a bachelor's degree)."
4,Pretty good explanation of this book of The Bible,"The author presents the book of revelation in a clear cut and easy to understand manner. Also, it doesn't come across of being biased as some books of theology can be. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic."
2,"A deep book, but at times a difficult premise","I had a hard time with this book. I started out liking it, and I do 'get it', but I cannot agree with the overall conclusion of the book: that the book of revelation is simply a book applicable for any time in history where persecution and compromise are widespread. As I search through several different bibles, look at the world today in light of history, and search my own feelings about what John was actually writing about and to whom, I am struck with the overwhelming conclusion that the revelation was and is anything but a kind of fuzzy, nonspecific book of the bible. Far from it. It takes more than scholarly logic to understand it. It takes faith. Either you 'see the signs of the times' or you have closed your eyes to the obvious. This was one of my main problems with the book.Nonetheless, if you have the patience, it may be a different perspective worth reading about, if only to see a 'possibly' incorrect interpretation. David W."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this book for myself. Several years ago I read a book that was very detailed about the events that would occur during the end of time. I have not been able to locate that book again, but it was based on the Bible. I was hoping that this book would be as good. I was extremely disappointed with this book. I only read small sections of the book because it was rather boring and seemed to give several points of view instead of actually giving the author's interruption of events to come. Maybe I just didn't read enough of the book, but I didn't find it interesting enough. The book was not what I expected, and I did not like it."
4,Xmas gift,This was a christmas gift for our nephew who seemed to like it. It looked to be a nice kit.
2,Torch fizzled out,I bought this as a chrismas present for another nephew of mine. It was fun for the ten minutes it took to build it. Now it is lost in some drawer. I found no educational value in this toy.What a waste of money. I don't recommend buying this item.
3,Basic,"I was sad that the whole thing wasn't a build. It was easy to put together, but I still wanted the knowledge for my son to see the inside ""guts"". When he is done with playing around with it, he is going to take it apart piece by piece and study it. I was also disappointed that one of the wire holes was missing. We had to just wrap the wire around the tab which got loose. Easy fix, though. Overall.. I would say I wish it was more educational from the start, instead of having to take it all apart to understand the concept. My son did say he hopes there is no battery that he is just triggering to make it light up."
4,small but neat,"cool, and simple. it was easy to assemble only took about 5 min. works good it is noisey. good for kids."
4,Great Album With Some Classic Songs,"While this recording has more than its share of great songs--including the title track as well as a duet with Bruce Springsteen (""Everything I Do"")--two of the songs are certifiable classics. ""Buddy and Peggy Sue"", a great dark blistering rocker with a Warren Zevon bite at the end and ""Is Fellini really Dead"", a beautiful and haunting ballad with wonderful guitar work that does more than justice to its subject. Fans of Dylan, Zevon, Waits, and Springsteen should know about this guy. Murphy is one of the best singer/songwriters around and this collection is absolutely first rate!"
5,The height of the monologue,"This is a fine collection of monologues from the period during which Keillor was most popular, and it also has gorgeous guitar links provided by Chet Atkins, whose trademark arpeggios are beautifully rendered on an acoustic guitar with a rich, mellow sound. I was moved by these recordings to buy several Chet Atkins CDs. ""Meeting Donny Hart at the Bus Stop,"" ""Pastor Inqvist's Trip to Orlando,"" and ""Mammoth Concert Tickets"" contain all of the elements that earned Keillor his loyal following -- an affection for the Minnesota region, fallible human characters, hope and compassion, all told with a twinkling sense of humor."
5,The antidote to reality TV,"In a time when reality television programs are wildly popular, with their narcissistic, silly people who think fame will make them important, these stories are about life. As so many other reviewers have noted, Garrison Keillor's Lake Woebegone stories look at human nature with all of its frailties and hidden dreams and hilarity and moments of grace. He can make you laugh out loud and cry in one story. I've had this cd collection for about 13 years now, and I still don't get tired of it. All the stories are good, but Bruno the Fishing Dog remains one of my all-time favorites. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
5,This is one of his best,"Like another reviewer, I am a big GK fan, but his later works are not as heartfelt as this collection. I often give this as a gift whether or not the recipient knows of GK. The stories are moving and tender."
2,Written like a text book,"After reading Thomas Mails' Fools Crow and Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power, I was eagerly looking forward to reading this book. Alas, I was quite disappointed. The writing style was plodding, and frankly it was often a boring read.The information contained in this book is quite good. But Mails jumps around so much between tribes, it is difficult to follow. The book is broken into two chapters; the first is about the training of young boys to become warriors and the second is about the mature warrior.If you are just looking for information about the life of the Plains Indians(for a term paper or you are just interested), you will probably benefit by purchasing this book. But if you are looking for a bit of excitement, I would recommend against this one."
4,The Boat and Darwin,"An interesting history is given of the Beagle (the boat, not Darwin). There were three major expeditions of the Beagle - two to Tierra del Fuego and the third to Australia. The last two of these were five years in length. Darwin was on the middle voyage rounding the South American continent to the Galapagos Islands, and then circum-navigating the globe through the Pacific and Africa off Cape Horn. The nature and extent of these voyages boggles the mind. The author could have placed more emphasis as his featured main historical star - Charles Darwin. It is rather disappointing to have his colossal presence disappear after the second voyage. For a minor historical tidbit Lincoln and Darwin share the same birth date."
2,Not a direct replacement,This grill replacement did not fit my Charbroil model as listed. The original had rounded corners to fit the contour of the oven lip. I had to modify the straight corners by cutting through the weld joints and bending them round to lay flat in the corners.The grate steel ribs are space too far apart for items like hot dogs & hamburgers.
1,Cracks when over torqued.,Molded clear plastic is prone to cracking under only mild over screwing. Lack of competitive alternatives available. I would not recommend these.
1,Oh God is it bad,"Oh, god is it bad! Oh God. Mmmm, oh god this movie is bad. I didn't understand the plot, I don't understand how anybody was convinced that this film was watchable, the whole thing is one big bore. Its unlike anything that I have ever seen before, absolutly nothing works in the film. It is composed completely, of the sneering one (Gary Busey) running back in forth around Canada. Not much shooting, not many villians, its money thrown into the wind completely incosequnetial and without an ounce of merit. I accidently rented this, thinking that it was ""The Warriors"", you know about street gangs. Beware guys."
3,Warriors ...quiet action ... good closeups of MPare!,"Being a Michael Pare fan, I beg to differ with the incredibly bad review given this movie. I thought it was an exceptional vehicle for Michael Pare's tough guy image. He's silent, moody, he gets the job done. He's a man on a mission and in conflict with himself because a new wife doesn't understand his willingness to go at any moment. The ending though, leaves you hanging on what the outcome of the 'winners' will be."
5,Jean-Luc's best,"When it comes right down to it, all these reviews are purely personal opinion. With that in mind, this is my favorite. I own ten of Jean-Luc's CDs and this one, along with Enigmatic Ocean, are the ones I listen to the most. I especially like the drum work on A Taste for Passon. Awesome! Maybe its the production, but the drums seem to come alive. Nice deep, rich sound. It also has more violin and less synthesizer; I like that. At any rate I would suggest this CD to any body who appreciates good contemporary jazz. Good Stuff!"
5,A Taste for Passion.,"Having followed Mr. Ponte sense his days with Frank Zappa, the contents of A Taste For Passion shows his growth as a musician and composer. The tracks: Beach Girl, Sunset Drive and Dreamy Eyes are among the best conceived tracks of his career, if you are in need of relaxation and inspiration this CD is a must have, and will not disappoint you."
5,outdoor music,"this album is an aural mozaic of the landscape that you are presently looking at,providing you are out of doors, very inspiring!"
2,A low point for Ponty,"Hard to understand what happened here. Songs like ""Beach Girl"" and ""Life Cycles"" sound like 2 or 3 ideas haphazardly pasted together. Most of the record lacks a groove easily found on other JLP records of this era. ""Sunset Drive"" is an exception, with a nice fretless bass solo by Ralphe Armstrong (whatever happened to him?).I can't say if CD sound quality is better, I only bought the LP some 20 years ago, and sorry I did.Forget this one."
2,Swivelift,"I wore the bra for a wedding. It was not easy to attach. It didn't fit quite right but my dress helped hold it in place, so it ended up working.It's made of a material similar to pool noodles which got uncomfortable when I was warm. You are only supposed to wear it for 4 hours. I wore it longer since the wedding/reception were not done within four hours. I was fine for about 8 or 9 hours but then got itchy. It's extremely painful to remove. It's sticks to you with adhesive tape, so it's like you're taking a very large bandaid off.It comes with 3 sets of tape but I just threw mine away after one use. It is cheap and fulfilled it's purpose, but I would never use it again."
5,What a fantastic reference for the at-home baker.,"This book is a must have for the at-home baker. From novice to expert, this is a wonderful resource for all who love making fantastic desserts that everyone will die for. The recipes are easy to follow and the author gives step by step instructions so that each recipe is virtually no fail. The authors also were very generous by including references for where to purchase everything you will need to make goodies just like the pros at Gayle's. Great book."
3,misleading,seller is still using picture of original book. They are selling the newly printed version from ten speedpress. They are selling over printed cover price.It is not the original book which is out of print. I wanted the original book. I kept book since they gave a credit back for difference in cover price. This book is widely available in the new version. I was mis led on what I was buying and am surprised they have not changed photo for book face.
1,JVC = Garbage,"Don't waste your time on this junk. Mine blew up just out of warranty with a tape loading problem. Repairing is almost as expensive as purchasing a new model.I've checked other JVC problems on the net; broken CCDs, reset problems, etc. Stay away from JVC; I wish I did.By the way, JVC is terrible in low light compared to my 10 year old Sony 8mm."
1,This camera is not worth rating,"This camera is a piece of Junk. Battery was gone after 60 days. Spent 8 months trying to locate a battery. Now unit stays in unusable ""Unit in Safeguard Mode"". If anyone out there has an answer for this problem, please let me know. hosdoc@mynewroads.com"
1,Camera is not any good.,I am telling you people this camera was a waste of money. I urge you please consider a sony or some other brand. This camera has really nice features when they work. I keep getting this condensation message that comes up and will never go away. Also the tape always get stuck our and cannot automatically retract. This camera has went for service 3 times and THEY CANNOT FIX IT!!!!! Please condiser a sony. Dirt can record better video then this camera.
1,"Good Camcorder until ""condensation"" problem","I have had this camera for about 2 years. Worked great until about 6 months ago. When i would turn the camera on I would get a message that said ""STOP CONDENSATION"" it would last for a little while then the camera would work OK. As time went on, the message appeared more often and lasted longer. Now, it's hard to even use the camera, it works 1 out of every 25 times i turn it on. JVC won't respond to e-mail's and i have done everything to fix it that i have read on the internet. I cannot take it to a service center because they want $100 to just look at it and i think I can get a brand new one that hopefully will work for about $200. But you better believe it won't be a JVC."
1,JVC products have serious CCD sensor flaw,"I owned a JVC GR-D33US camcorder for a little over a year and the CCD sensor just went out on it and it gives a ""lens cap"" error message even with lens cap OFF. Not a good product if it only lasts for a little over a year!"
2,"Cheap camera, but not good for long term. Save your money for a better one","I got mine on sale for really cheap a few years ago, about $250. At the time, it was a steal for a mini dv camera. After about a year, it had a problem loading/ejecting the tape. Then it completely stopped working. It is frustrating to buy something that breaks. Also, it was terrible in low lighting situations. I would recommend saving your money for a better camera. In other words, the cost vs quality isn't worth it in the end."
4,A good story but not for fans of hack and slash,"This is a very good read if you are not looking for a hack and slash adventure. The characters are all well defined, the book reads easily, and is well structured. The characters are not superhuman, which is a nice change of pace and adds a pleasant flavor to the story. The ending becomes apparent in mid-story but this does not detract from the quality of the tale. I would say that anyone that enjoyed the Cleric Quintet, by R.A. Salvatore, would also enjoy this book."
5,POLICE PROCEDURES RULE THREE TIMES,For the fan of the Police Procedural novel NO ONE does it quite as well as Ed McBain. The 87th Precinct series has followed the changes in Police procedural an detection from the mid fifties to the present time.What a fun sampler this is 3 complete novels from the late 80's to the early 90's for approximately the price of two paper back novels.I truly got my money's worth out of these three totally differenttales of the 87th Precinct
5,The Bible Refutes Itself,"This book contains all the contradictions, absurdities and atrocities in the Christian Bible. The introduction is a lame piece of writing, and the book contains a lot of repetition, but there's no better way to prepare for a debate with a Christian. This book is a one-stop Bible buster."
4,Condradictions,"I did not realize it was simply a list of Biblical Contradicts, but I still liked and would recommend it."
1,MORE DIRT THAN MUSSELS,"NEVER in my life have i had a food with more dirt, sand, shell pieces and other unrecognizable inedible garbage in it than this. found out about the massive grit with the first can of the case and then decided it was OUR fault for not straining and washing them. so, we opened ALL of the rest of the cans and strained the juice through fine cloth and then washed, individually by hand, all of the mussels. massive amount of garbage resulted. juice had a layer of fine sand/silt at the bottom of it but we were able to pour the settled top off and use it. not so for the mussels. tried to use them as food but the garbage was throughout them. EXPENSIVE CAT FOOD."
4,Another good one.,"If you've never read one of Og Mandino's books, you should. They are inspiring for success minded people. I find that reading these types of books often, keeps my thoughts focussed where they should be. Most of his books reiterate the same principles, with a new idea here or there. You've probably heard these principles before, but they are presented nicely here. Great value for the cost of this book."
5,the book changed my life!,"this is the greatest book i have ever read, though i only fowllow half of the book instructions(my father's stroke broke my progress ), i benefit a lot from the book, especially the attitude to the world and human. now i am no longer the boy who feel the world treats him unfair, but a guy feel the world is full of love,and readiy to help anyone who needs help"
3,"I'm sorry, I just didn't get why everyone else likes this book","After finishing this book all I can take away from it was that I enjoyed the ten ""vows of success"". Great words of wisdom, easy to quantify in your life and sound advice. I just simply didn't enjoy the parable to get to the end. Again, I must have missed something because it does seem like lots of other people enjoy this book but it just didnt seem to resonate with me."
3,Great while it lasts.,"When it was working it was amazing, my room has a huge t.v. a 360 and gaming p.c. in it.For those who don't know that makes a lot of heat.had it for 2 years and while it was on and worked it was amazing. kept my room ice cold.my girl friend is from Alaska (I'm here in Mid state NY) and she loves the temp in my room... before...it just stopped.one night it just made a odd sound and then it was a very nice fan.alas, the life span was not as good as i would hope.i give it a b- on a curve of doing what it does.if i was a hard grader. id say c++"
5,Liked it so much I bought another one.,I received this AC 3 years ago as a house warming gift for my bedroom and ended up putting it in my daughter's stuffy bedroom. I love that I can remotely change the settings without having to go into her room while she's sleeping.Since I didn't have an AC in my bedroom I bought another 5000 BTU (Daewoo 5300 BTU at Costco). I was extremely disappointed as it does not work at all compared to this Frigidaire model. For $10 more this is the only AC I will ever need for my 120 sq ft bedroom.
3,"Okay, but not impressive","I don't really know how the tag 8000 would appear in this page, but I was looking for several 8000BTU AC at the same time and was convinced that this is the lowest price AC. Then the tragedy happened. I got an overpriced 5000BTU AC instead and cost me too much too return so I have to keep it.The lessons: 1. Check the BTUs and specs first! And for this AC, it is decent but not strong enough to cool a bigger room fast enough. It uaually take more than 40min to cool down to 80 degree or higher for a living room sized room in the evening!2. Also, check the price on google product and Neweggs! I am a long customer to both Amazon and Neweggs, and I must say that after comparing so many AC, Neweggs's price ROCKS!"
4,Perfect for small area,"I purchased this unit to cool and dehumidify my woodworking shop. The electronic thermostat has been really handy. Installation was simple and straight forward. Only one month of use, but so far so good."
3,Easy to install,"This air conditioning unit was easy to install. I have a small bedroom window and it fit right inside. The electronic features are easy to use, the remote control is simple to use. Pretty good air conditioner."
2,Similar Unit Broke After 3 Years,"I bought a similar AC unit (FAA055P7A) on June 6, 2008. On July 24, 2011, it started making squealing sounds whenever it ran. We were afraid to use it.Figuring that we'd have to buy a new unit anyway, I decided to open it, in the slight chance that I could repair it. These things don't just pop open. An hour later, I found that a little rubber seal on the axle that drives the fans had rotted and fallen into the centrifugal fan compartment.I don't know if that qualifies as planned obsolescence, but it amounts to the same thing. Most people would have bought a new unit. I almost did.I put it back together (minus the seal) and it appears to work fine.I should mention that, when working on devices like this, always make sure they're unplugged. And watch out for capacitors that can shock you even if the unit's unplugged."
3,Rattles,"The unit is noisy. Not just operation noise from the motor and fan but also internal rattles denoting poor construction and choice of materials. There are polystyrene baffles inside that could be responsible for some of this noise. I am considering opening it up to try to detect and rectify the rattles and vibration problems.The remote, timer for on and off, economy function, and appearance are all good."
3,Clean Air Control,"The product description states ""FAX054P7A features clean air filtration that provides relief for increasing numbers of allergy and respiratory ailment sufferers"" but there was no clean air control button on the product provided."
5,Best Air Conditioner I've seen for the Price!,"We now have 3 different air conditioners in our apartment that we've acquired over the past year in New York and this one is by far the best.Besides this unit, we have a cheap manual 5,000 BTU unit (Daewoo) and a $300 7,500 BTU SPT portable air conditioner. The Daewoo doesn't have an automatic shut off or an energy saver temperature control function like the Frigidaire unit and its almost twice as loud. The STP, though quieter and energy efficient, is a BIG unit that takes up quite a bit of space in our bedroom (65 pounds, roughly 3 feet tall). Though its more energy efficient (An EER of over 12!), it does not have an automatic shutoff (just a timer) or a remote control like the Frigidaire.The Frigidaire is a really elegant unit and perfect for a room with a television. If one of our other units breaks, I'll definitely replace it with another one of these!"
1,refuses to warranty,"Lasted one summer and Frigidare refuses to warranty even though it is on warranty. Their India customer service sent us back to Amazon for refund and Amazon sent us to Frigidare, and back and forth. Don't buy this product if you expect it to perform normally for years as it won't, and Frigidare won't honor their warranty. Do not buy this product!"
5,Awesome book for parents!,"I received my copy of this book yesterday and couldn't put it down. I read the entire thing last night! Without question, this is the finest book I have ever read on child safety and child predators. The information (and the real-life examples) and the lessons are easy to follow and powerful. I really got a feel for how predators think. I know a lot more today about predators and how to protect kids then I did yesterday! I'll be recommending it to all my friends who are parents ... and even those who aren't."
5,A national treasure!,"I recently came across this cd and fell in love with the lively music of Howard Armstrong (Louie Bluie). Afterwards, I did a little research and found that he was truly honored as a national treasure for his influence on ragtime, jazz and blues. Its a great recording! Not to be missed!!"
5,PARAMOUNT IN THE 19th CENTURY ..!!!!!,"What does it take for this studio to get into the 21st century and put their movies on DVD? There is a block of musical lovers and Betty Hutton lovers that want to buy this movie but we dont own VCRs anymore! Besides anything with this cast has to be fun ,but not on VCR! At least not on my plasma tv!!!"
4,"Heart-warming, funny and, of course, great dancing!","Fred Astaire is superb as a dancer and comedian in this enchanting comedy. Betty Hutton is hilarious as the comedic would-be partner of Astaire. Astair's ""piano dance"" is the outstanding favorite of this film. However, Hutton's song and dance routine which ends with her jumping into a lake with her backside smoldering will have you in stitches. I highly recommend this heart warming film for whole families."
5,Great gift - Pastel Journal subscription,Pastel Journal first issue arrived before Xmas!What a surprise for my artist friend. Shecalled right away to thank me. Said it was a great gift since with each issue she learns and is inspired.Nothing could please me more than to hear the gratitude in her voice.Thanks Amazon for fast processing!
4,Pastel Journal,"I read Pastel Journal every month to see what other artists are doing, view a calender of pastel shows, and get information about pastel products. This magazine is hard to find in stores. I really look forward to getting an issue."
5,Business comes alive,"This is the only book of business quotations I've ever encountered that lays out what really happens in business life. It's like listening to the proverbial guy at the water cooler, he lowers his voice--you lean closer, knowing you're getting the necessary tidbits to survive the job. You know you're hearing the truth. What's surprising in this book, is that the water cooler guy is often the CEO speaking. Who knew these big guns talked so bluntly? Gone it seems are veils of public relations and smooth, life-as-it-should-be speak. It's a terrific read of business in the late 20th century."
4,"Great glove, a bit big","I use these gloves for more than one use (had one pair last me a whole week), but they actually fit a bit more largely than other reported. To be fair I have been told I have 'piano player' fingers and despite my 6 1/2 years in the Marines, all my masonry and timber framing work, and the fact that I'm constantly working on cars (purpose of the gloves), my fingers refuse to get that sausage look, thus not allowing me to fill out the fingers of these gloves. I recommend getting the normal size glove and then working up. Better a tight nitrile glove than a loose one.++ Longevity++ Tough buggers. I have yet to have on split on me.- Black color makes it hard to tell if you have grit on your gloves."
2,Too Expensive & Not Flexible Enough,"I have used latex gloves both professionally and personally for 40 years and luckily have no allergic reaction to latex. However, I thought I would try a non-latex glove to see how I liked them. This black nitrile glove had a number of good reviews so I tried them. The first box of large were too small for me, so I then bought X-large and they fit. However, I do not like the lack of flexibility and lessened tactile sensation of these compared to latex and they are harder to put on. Most importantly, this particular brand is essentially twice the price of high-quality latex gloves, so I am just going to stick to latex."
1,Try another book!,Very superficial information - you can do better just by doing an online search and reading that up. Save your money for a better book.
4,nVidia GeForce 7600GS 512MB DDR2 AGP Video Card with TV DVI,"Great for the bucks. Runs COD4 pretty good. Can not set settings full up though. But it does just fine. I have a P4,3.06 duel proseser, 1GB DDR2 with a 19inch LCD. I set the card at 1024 X 768 and the graphics look great. For 89bucks, go for it. PS: It came with setup CD - no hitches, but don't forget to plug in power to the card (4 prong plug from the 350 watt minimum power supply) or the card will not perform good, and I got messages from the card telling me to ""make sure you supply power to the card"". I didn't do that at first because nothing in the instructions said to."
4,Nice accessible atlas. . . .,"A serviceable world atlas, if one wants to get a sense of the geography of different regions. The advantage is that all portions of the world are covered. By focusing at the regional level (e.g., North central Europe, Southern Africa, Arctic region),...more A serviceable world atlas, if one wants to get a sense of the geography of different regions. The advantage is that all portions of the world are covered. By focusing at the regional level (e.g., North central Europe, Southern Africa, Arctic region), one does not get quite the detail desired. Also, the wording is pretty small (making it a bit harder to read as one's eyes grow somewhat weaker with age!).Some additional and useful features: a nice index, flags and statistical information on countries of the world, world statistics (such as longest rivers, tallest mountains, etc.). For instance, what is the second highest mountain in the world (after Everest)? One gets the answer to that question here (see page 13)."
1,Great until it just plum stopped working...,"We loved this player at first. The kids could watch the same movie or different movies. My oldest (4 at the time) could figure out the remote to run it herself. My only complaint then was that it didn't come with a battery pack to be used on an airplane. I found a website where you could order one though for about $25. But within about 3 months, one of the players would just stop for no reason every so often. It would start playing again if you restarted it, but then you'd have to remember where you were in the movie and get there again. We then just switched to only using the other one. Now after another 3 months (6 months after buying it) that one stops too - every time we go over a bump or turn a corner. It drives me insane. It was so frustrating for the kids that they don't even ask to see a movie in the car anymore. So if you want to spend over $200 for the use of a dvd player for a few months, go ahead."
4,We love ours!,"We have owned this set for nearly 2 years. We bought it for a long trip and it makes trips to Grandma's a much easier experience.About a year ago, my husband broke one of the monitors and it can't be viewed anymore but will run cds just perfectly.With some ""redneck engineering"" we rigged the other unit in the van so that the kids could still watch videos from any seat in the back.Its still going strong! We are VERY PLEASED with our set."
1,Complete waste of money,"I was thrilled with this product initially. I liked the fact that each unit was separate from the other and 2 different movies could be watched at the same time. Within 2 months, the unit I kept in my car stopped working. It would stop every time the car went over a bump. Even the smallest of movements would cause it to stop. It was VERy frustrating for my [...]. The other unit is in my husbands car. That can only be used while being held on a lap and then raised in the air to protect it from the bumps. For the money spent, it was a waste. Of course, it's too late for me to return it to the store for my money back."
1,cheap junk,My wife and I were very excited about this product at first and our girls loved watching DVD's on family trips. We used the players about 6 month and one of them stopped working. Warranty only for 90 days. I learned a good lesson. BUY QUALITY AND FROM A COMPANY THAT WILL BACK IT UP.
1,1 road trip and it died!,"We bought this in February to use in the car on road trips. We have 2 children 6 and 3 and figured it would be the best way they could each watch what they wanted and not fight. The first day we turned it on one was already making a humming noise. By day 4 of our road trip our daughter tried to turn it on and it was now black and white and full of lines. All she could do was plug into the other and listen to the other one. For the first 3 days it was worth every penny, and now I am very glad we bought it on sale! Today I tried to call the company and after waiting on hold for 20 minutes the customer service rep hung up on me, when I was trying to get him to answer my questions. He would not even give me his name. So not only is the product worthless so was the customer support. I would not recommend this product to anyone!"
5,"Hope exists. Here it is. But it's within you, too.","People caring about each other? In a BAR? Hell, bars are where you go to get blind, right? At Callahan's, people go to see. Hilarious, touching, amazing - what can happen when people CARE. And TRY to be better than they are. Twenty years of stories, all in one edition. And cheap at thrice the price."
5,A Toast From the Chalk Line,"I just read the Complete Callahan Chronicles - a collection of short stories Spider Robinson published over the years about a bar on Long Island where odd and mysterious things happen, but where all the patrons are friends and troubles are handled by a group - not by individuals.It's the best example of a modern tribe I've seen and I wish I could go down to Callahan's Place and stand at the chalk line, drain a glass of scotch, offer up a toast, and toss my glass into the fireplace."
3,Why Tongues by Kenneth Hagin,"I read this many years ago & loved it then but this time it wasn't the same, I guess cause I am not the same. But I imagine some would like it ...It's just according to where your at spiritually.."
5,Don't Miss Out!,"This short, easy to read, INEXPENSIVE booklet will erase any lingering doubts you may have as to whether or not tongues is Biblical or for today's Christian. Not only does God want us to ""pray in the Spirit,"" but we NEED to! Do you happen to have a problem in your life-- a sin, an attitute, a circumstance, or anything else that resists overcoming? After seeing what the Bible really says about this subject, you'll understand why we cannot afford to neglect or disdain the special prayer language God designed just for us, so that we can be all that He has in mind for us to be, so we can have the life He desires for us to have, and to empower us to carry out His will"
1,Nice until you wash them,"The tag on the towels says to wash them brfore use, so i did, exactly as they specified. When i took them out of the washer, the Giants logos were totally wrinkled and withered. I couldn't even use them once. I sent them back and got my money back. Thankfully there was no issue returning them."
3,Little short on wire length - and may not work for you,If the wire were about 6 inches longer it could go up behind the bumper and plug into the bumper socket.Edit: My 2012 Ram 1500 4x4 wiring is such that brake light and blinker are the same wire and bulb. When I hooked this up and put on the brake it looked good but when I turned on the blinker this light would blink also which I didn't like.
3,Item received different from picture.,"I was replacing a broken hitch brake light identical to the one pictured. Like other customers, I received a light that was different than the item pictured...it had a smaller ram's head and the word ""RAM"" at the bottom. I own a Ram 1500 and I thought it still looked OK, so I kept it. Though I believe that I prefer the item pictured."
3,Not The same design a the photo,"I purchased this Dodge Rams head logo to replace a broken one. I was not expecting a smaller Rams head and the word RAM below it. I have a Dakota and I liked the look of the one advertised in the photo. Other than a different item than the one I thought I had purchased, it does what it supposed to do... add a bit of safety (a 4th brakelight) and style to your receiver type hitch."
3,A real review,"Product comes as described and performs well. I haven't had it very long, so I don't know how long it'll last. I question it's durability because it feels pretty cheap and is entirely plastic. I also doubt that it's designed to take any damage, because it's a poorly designed product. The cable hangs down from the bottom of the light and makes it really tacky. There's no way for the cable through the back without taking it apart(which i'd rather not do yet) The plate over it that makes the dodge logo is also pretty cheap. You could probably replicate this product yourself with a cheap brake light from walmart($5 to $15), A dodge stencil(or sticker), and black spray paint. Although everything I've said has been negative thus far, I don't regret the purchase, it just didn't make my expectations.Pros; It's brightCons; Made of plastic and the Wire hangs from the bottom of the light.Summary; bad enough not to buy again, but not bad enough to return"
4,Jazz Fusion Drummer,"This is a compilation of some 1970s LPs and doesn't cover his entire career. It's well done and if you like Weather Report, Chick Corea, Santana or Miles Davis of this period, you'll enjoy this one. At 8 tracks and just over 40 minutes, one wishes they'd be a little more generous. What's here is a pretty good mix of Cobham compositions though."
3,A Period Piece,"This album sounds very '70s, but perhaps that is because it is!The synthesizer drums are all but forgotten nowadays and for good reason. Buy this if you want to relive the days when rock music was scrambling to sound original, and strayed over into jazz. Jazz music in the '70s was aimless too."
4,Nice color,"I like the dark brownish color. For some reason the clasp has a sharp edge, & will dig into my wrist & cause a red irritation. I loosened it up but it still does it every couple of weeks or so. Have been wearing Skagen watches for 15 years & haven't had this happen."
2,Instructions Needed,"This is an inexpensive little dollhouse which is more like a wooden puzzle than a model kit. The directions are very sparse, considering how many parts there are, and there is only the photo on the front to use to see where pieces go, which means you can't see how it's supposed to be put together on the inside. If you like those wooden insect and dinosaur puzzles and want something more complicated, you might like this. If you want something more like a model kit with step-by-step instructions for assembly, this is NOT the kit to buy."
2,Not worth it,I bought this product at Michale's not off of this particular sellers page. This was one of the more complicated wooden pieces I have purchased in the past. I am not a person who has a lot of patience and i ended up throwing this product away due to my frustration. Overall this was not my type of product but it may be your type of product.
1,Replacement screwpull,"Replacement screw for screw pullThe new product did not work any better than the old one which I thought had lost the Teflon coating, which would Explain the difficulty getting the screw out of the cork after opening the bottle.Maybe the pull itself is distorted ... Any way I am not using the screw pull at all any more.EPM 10/2012"
4,Perfect!,After many uses the screws on Screwpulls become dull and it is harder to get that cork out. The replacement was easy to install and made getting to my glass of wine faster and easier!
2,Cute but!,The first thing I noticed is that my babies name was smudged before I even opened it. When I opened it the two crowns at the top fell apart! The ribbon is also shorter then I thought it would be.
1,Best of Spinners,"This CD does NOT have the tracks listed. No ""Rubberband Man"",""Could It Be.."", nor ""Then Came You"". I was VERY dissapointed!Those were the only songs I wanted. BOO AMAZON!!!!!!!Fix your track listings!"
5,The First Best Of The Spinners People!,"First of all i was reading some of the reviews for this cd and amazon is being blamed for people who don,t know that the spinners were on motown first.For which the hits truly yours/it,s a shame(written by stevie wonder)ill always love you and together we can make such sweet music all classics on MOTOWN! thats why they have a best of with MOTOWN! .For those of you looking for the best of the spinners, ill be around/rubberband man/then came you will find them on ATLANTIC! Now that thats this cd is a real classic enjoy!"
2,Broken after a month,"Loved this ring when it arrived. My mom has had trouble with her one finger locking up so I thought this might help. It did help and was wonderful at first! The stiffness was gone and she raved about it. Then after wearing it for a month, it broke in half. I was disappointed it felt apart so fast."
3,Delicate item!,"Unfortunatly, this ring only lasted me about a month before it was cracked in two by gripping something to hard while I was wearing it... I have always been attraced to hematite and the product is of good quality, but must be treated delicatly or you will snap it half..."
3,Average whodunit - too many red herrings,"I finished the book and it was a moderately complex story, but there were so many characters. Then I realized it was a series and so the background characters had all played roles in other novels. There are some funny and fun and imaginative moments in the book and overall I enjoyed it. Could not keep up with all the characters."
5,Smells so nice and not overpowering!!,"I have been using this bath powder for a few months and I love it. The large powder puff that comes with it make it so nice to use, and this powder has a clean delicate smell."
5,super,"Very quick service. Aunite was thrilled to life (since she's 85, death is not a good choice of words!)I will purchase 2 more at X-mas time."
3,Beware Floyd lovers,"Don't think that there's everything in here. The author's concept of rock is very limited. Don't expect Hendrix, Zep or Floyd. You get only the roots. And for that, it's a good book."
2,Too big,"If your special someone has big wrists, this will probably make them very happy. But if they have normal, lady-sized wrists..."
3,Habia una vez un marido,"It's O.K is a very good to describe it, it's entertaining I can say. The way is described as a Pedro Infante movie is incorrect, there's only one song he sings and that's it"
3,Haven't watched it YET!,"Received promptly and I hope to watch with the Grand kids, very soon. Will be able to rate my purchase, then!"
4,Brings back old memories....,"I found this looking for something new for my 3-yr old nephew to watch now and then. It was great to watch these classics again, although my nephew isn't quite ready for them yet. I wish cartoons now days were as fun to watch as the Flinstones were!The only downside to this dvd set was that you cannot turn off the laugh track. I personally hate the laugh tracks on shows and would prefer the option to turn them off."
5,love it,"Classic cartoons that are fun, pleasant, and simple to follow. Comparing ""The Flintstones"" to modern 'cartoons' would be like comparing a 20oz Delmonico to a 99 cent cheeseburger."
1,product misrepresented,The playlist for this cassette lists 11 songs. The tape I received contained only 7 songs and was only about 15 minutes in length. I ordered the cassette because it had one song on it I was having trouble finding anywhere else. Guess which song was not among the 7 on the tape? I spent $15 for nothing. I could have purchased a good cd for less than that. What a rip off!
1,What a disappointment!,"The track listing on the ad included 11 songs including ""Frog Kissin'"" (which was what I wanted). Unfortunately, the CD only has 7 tracks - very short, less than 30 minutes of music. $25 + shipping and I didn't even get the song I wanted! Buyers beware!"
5,An inspiring read,"This is one of those books that makes you question what you are doing with your life. I recommend that any college student unsure of what they wish to do after their undergraduate years, or unsatisfied professionals looking for a career change, take a look at Wendy Kopp's story about Teach For America's beginnings, development, and impact. It is a great read for anyone who wants to make a difference in the world, but is unsure where to start or needs reminding that nothing is impossible.The only problem I had with this product was that it still had some kinks that needed to be worked out in its Kindle format; some of the section titles throughout the chapters were illegible. Other than that, it was an excellent book."
3,Interesting Book,"I just started with TFA and wanted to read more about how the movement began. The organization is almost unrecognizable compared to present day, it really has evolved a lot over the years, at testament to what she talks about in the book: constantly seeking to improve. Good, quick read."
4,The Flight of the Cosmic,"I have been listening to JLP since Imaginary Voyage, (New Country, Milky Way etc.) This is progressive jazz at its best. His style is the one and only. Fast and progressive. Tip towing through the stars like a comet. This album was just an anthitesis of the flight to the stars of a man that has impacted me in a great way since I first listen to him. At his Live concerts, with his ""Good Evening"". he played all of his album like a medly. Soft, continues, lavish, like floting in the galaxey."
4,Probably his best outing yet!,"I've heard covers of some songs from this album before but I couldn't imagine that the album should be this good, probably his best outing yet!Stay Proggy!"
1,A book with no substance.,This book is a repeat of job hunting ideas that have been around for 30 years. It is already well established that the best way to get a job is not help wanted ads or recruiters. The book doesn't help you prepare a particularly good resume or cover letter. It promotes the idea of cold calling but leaves the reader with the task of developing your own ideas for how to accomplish this. I would not recommend this book. You would be better off to purchase a book on resume preparation and letter writing.
3,A Good Start,"There is not much out there in Ukrainian language learning software, so this is a good start. It covers basic some basic vocabulary, but only a few travel phrases. It was simple and easy to use. Not much depth, but is billed 'beginning level.' I did not care for the 'ditzy' personalities or the gambling motif, but that is all window dressing. Almost the same as Instant Immersion - Talk Now: Russian! --except for the language of course."
5,Samsung SPP-2040,This is a great little printer. I bought for my wife who does a lot of scrapbooking and puts it through its paces. The picture quality is amazing and its a breeze to use. It prints a 4x6 print in about 60sec or slightly less. Very versitile printer for an amazingly low price (Amazon had the best price)Very happy with this purchase and would strongly recomend this printer.
5,Samsung Photo Printer,This is my first experience with a Photo Printer. The pictures have great quality to the them and they are clear and sharp. Easy to use and faster then waiting for them to be developed.
4,PIcture Perfect - Well for $68.00 Perfect enough,"I'm 63 Dyslexic and PC challenged. So while people on this site say easy to install HA. But I installed it and it only took 2 hours. Now if I had to do it again 20 minutes from unpacking to install is all Id need. Printed my first 2 pictures and all was wonderful. The quick install book is in Japanese, no joke however the instruction book is 40 pages and in English, but you only need that if your printing off line, or your creating special effects. The manual looks a little intimidating though, especialy to a Dyslexic.If you are hooking up to your PC as I did, you need the printer cable from Comp-USA, Microcenter or some such outfit, $25.00It prints great pictures, good luck."
5,car seat base,i got this for our son we had two cars & 1 carseat so we just took out the carseat & left the bases in the car. I loved it & it was so convenient for us. good price as well
2,Didn't fit our Eddie Bauer,"My husband and I were very disappointed when we received this, and it did not fit our Eddie Bauer Trailmaker car seat. It had said it fits all Eddie Bauer models but it does not. If you have the trail maker travel system, then the base we found that does fit is a safety first model at Babies-R-Us."
1,Did not fit seat,"Number matches the carseat, but it did not fit.There were reviews that said it would fit, but it was not safe. My engineer husband and my fireman son both tried to make it work, no luck."
1,Does NOT fit Eddie Bauer Trailmaker travel system,Did not even come close to fitting the carseat from the Eddie Bauer Trailmaker Sinclair travel system. Had to return it. Easy return though so that was good at least...
2,Doesn't fit my Eddie Bauer car seat!!,This says it fits Eddie Bauer car seats but I have the sinclair travel system and it doesn't fit the car seat. It appears to be of good quality but I am very disappointed to see that it doesn't fit. Even the box says it fits Eddie Bauer car seats (doesn't specify which ones).
4,Thank Goodness for Bases!!!,This base works wonderfully!! It is nice to be able to buy just an extra base..
4,Infant Car Seat Base,"It's what I expected. My daughter recently had a baby and has an infant seat. Instead of putting her base into my car, buying the extra base was perfect. Saves alot of time."
3,False advertising,"This item was listed as being sold as a set, having a shipping weight of 18.2 pounds, needing separate shipping and and original price of $ 349.99, all of which imply that this is a set however when the item arrived there was one roll of tape in the same package as my other item. $10 is steep for 1 roll of tape.[EDIT] after talking to amazon they said it was a typo and promised to correct the item"
2,Great value watch,"Very good casual watch, keeping time, clasp feels a little chip, luminosity is very poor. Then again, I've paid $135 delivered.And this is not Patek Philipe or Omega. Any way, cannot complain. Great watch for the money.Changing my review... Was all fine for 2 months and then watch stoped working... Very disappointed. Thanks to Amazon I had quick refund."
5,Very nice watch that looks great also,"The packin, booklets, box packing is high quality and luxury. I'm very pleased with this watch. The band is very nice leather! The band system is also very nice to wear! The watch case shines is very thick and sturdy! Is not a light watch! That's is also great!"
5,Alfie is a hero,"This is a wonderful book. It's about 4-year-old Alfie and a birthday party for his friend Bernard, who is as boistrous as Alfie is shy. At first Alfie refuses to go to the party without his blanket and refuses to put it down with the coats, but in the end, he learns that he can get along without his blanket after all. He bravely decides to put it aside so that he can cheer up a little girl who's even more bashful than he is. Alfie is a sweetie.The illustrations (by the author, Shirley Hughes) are colorful and engaging, depicting a delightful array of characters. Ms. Hughes has a keen eye for how people really look. All of her Alfie books are terrific -- this one is my family's favorite."
2,This book is too long,"Shirley Hughes has charmingly illustrated her book of a preschooler who goes to his first birthday party.Unfortunately,the story is too long for the audience for which it was intended.Older readers may read it with memories of their first social function,but your four year old may squirm in their seat awaiting the conclusion."
2,Better in theory...,"I got this to use with my night light, but, apparently, this needs bright and direct sunlight on the sensor to work properly. Even though my room gets plenty of sunlight, the light shadow cast by the neighboring cabinet was enough to tell the photocell that it was dark. In addition, my night light stands up, casting another shadow on the cell (and the polarized plug makes reorienting it impossible). End result was that the night light was on all the time. To top it off, this unit dims the light bulb, hiding behind the claim that doing so extends bulb life. Using an automatic timer instead of this works much better."
2,Doesn't work for me,"I haven't been able to get it to work. The sensor doesn't sense night and day unless it's in a very sunny spot. Most power outlets are on the wall about a foot up from the floor, so they don't get much light. It may work for you if you have a spot where there is bright sun on the power outlet that it's connected to."
2,Not sensitive enough,"We bought four of these to use with lamps in the house along with timers. The intent was to plug the lamp into this photo cell, the photo cell into a timer, and the timer into the wall. The timer would turn on at 6am and the lamp would turn on until it was daylight and turn off, then turn on again in the evening until the timer turned it off at night. However, these photo cells are not sensitive enough to turn the lamp off unless they are in almost direct sunlight. The light they require to turn off the lamp has to be VERY bright - if you plug them into a wall outlet that is in a part of the room that doesn't get a lot of natural light they will never turn off. I wish they had a sensitivity adjustment."
2,'Some small hope' --is the gem,"Only the opening track of 'Some small hope' is absolutely stunningly beautiful. It's a duet with David Sylvian and his voice melts with Virginia's in one unitone chorus of bliss. Produced and written by Ryuichi Sakamoto this is one for the history books, definitely. But for the rest; it's Virginia solo; way to folky for my taste."
4,"Corto Circuito, new sound of feeling in italian music","99 Posse speaks out about the italian goverenment and produces an intensity in their music which is something never before heard in italian music. Sung in napolian dialect, it combines rap with a computer generated sound. Tracks to listen to are Boungiorno and Quello Che."
5,FoRza 99 PoSse & FoRza NaPoLi!!,"I weNt To TwO oF tHe 99 poSse CoNCeRts, aNd i MuSt Say TheY aRe siMpLy BreaThTaKiNg PeRFoRmeRs.

3,Good but not practical,I like the content. I hardly can use the book as a reference because it is missing a convenient section with mnemonics and their effects like you can find on other programming manual (I love the PowerPC one from IBM.) The succint part where the mnemonics are given is too small and not complete. Therefore I have to rely on some other manuals to understand precisely the output of the processor functions on its various registers. The book gives a good insight at MIPS architecture including VM and examples and pretty much everything is covered here. I wish the examples would have an extra column with the hexa values of there instructions counterpart to give some info on the way instructions are built.
3,"Not very extensive, almost a childrens book.","I thought this book would be a little more extensive. It had only a few color photos of hand drawn images from the author and the rest were black and white. It had a good explanation of the Legion's history but again, not as extensive as I thought it would be. Seems almost like a childrens book."
3,Quite interesting,"Although this book may not seem like a top-notch thriller, it does seem to qualify as an interesting read (although emotionally riveting at times), somewhat engrossing and informative with regard to the secrets of the medical world.It seems this MD has found another niche in which to shine. I'll look forward to checking out his next book."
1,Arrived after the promised date,I bought the product as a Christmas Gift. Upon ordering I noticed that the seller stated a delivery date range that did not ensure delivery by Christmas. I sent a message to the seller asking if I could pay to expedite the shipping and was told not to worry and that it would ship in the next days on Friday. Upon checking it did not ship until the following Tuesday and did not arrive by Christmas.TP
4,Great for basic usage,"This little machine is a workhorse, and very user friendly. The iMac was one of my first computers, and it taught me how to do things quickly. This is a great starter computer, but be warned that system 9 may not run the latest software. Also, because it's Mac, some games will not run on this machine."
2,These people are not robots!,"I bought this CD thinking this band was actually ""Captured! By Robots"" , a real robotic band from San Francisco. I was so sad to see that it is just a bunch of dudes from Columbus. The CD sounded sorta silly. This is not my cup of tea."
3,So So,Good source of raw data. Heavy on statistical analysis but sometimes omits on the reason for the indicated trends. The pure statistical analysis is not always correct.
4,nice towels,"what can go wrong with a kitchen towel, they absorb the water just fine. still enjoying them. they are nice"
2,It does drag on........,"The Wright Brothers are distant cousins of mine, so I was looking for a book that would give me the history of their lives. Not sure what I was expecting in this book, but it has EVERY finite detail and isn't a page turner. As my title says, it does drag on...."
1,Book Is Very Boring & Talks To Much Of Their Father's Life,"This book was a major dissapointment for me. I could not finish the book. The author dwelled more on the problems of the Wright Brother's father, and the chaos he delt with in their denomination. I felt like I was reading their father's life story. Historical bio's are my favorite reading, but this book I had to lay down. After several re-starts, I finaly gave the book away to another history friend. I will choose another bio if the Wright Brothers"
3,Source Book,"With the 100th anniversary of the invention of the airplane coming up one can expect a surge of interest in the Wrights. Crouch's book was one of two biographies that came out at about the same time several years ago. Crouch did an admirable job in delving into the very tight-knit Wright family, and how its complex relationships molded the inventors. But the superior biography, the best one yet in my opinion, is ""Wilbur and Orville"" by Fred Howard. It is more technically informed and better written. However, for those with a real bug for the Wrights, by all means read both."
2,Catia Reference Guide,This book is just as the title implies a reference guide. It lists the commands and what they do and nothing else. There are no examples on how to use them or typical applications. If you know the name of the command you can look it up and this book will tell you what it does. And that is all.
1,Shamefully brings bias to children's book,"The author's of this book shamefully show a political bias in their treatment of Presidents in this book. Flip to the facing pages of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, for instance, and you will find Reagan's page says ""Challenger Disaster, savings and loan failures, 500k people protested nuclear arms"" etc, etc. Carter, on the other hand, says things like ""modest carter, human rights as the key element of foreign policy, restore all that is good and decent and honest and truthful and fair and competent"", etc, etc. Amazingly, it even says ""Iran returned hostages to the US"" under Carter, which actually happened under Reagan! I am always disgusted when authors use a children's book to push their own agenda, and actually inlcuding misinformation is just revolting! Shameful."
1,Bad Medicine!!!,"This doctor has nothing but Bad Medicine for your game. If you think you got problems before this book, your gonna have even more after. First you will realize after a while that you just wasted your money :)... Then you will already of lost a few games hoping for something in this book to happen. The reason this is the first review should be a warning sign. Nobody that bought this book wants to admit it and review it. They are hoping someone else will make the same mistake so they can laugh at them. I really don't care if you wanna waste your money go for it. Just ask yourself why a book this old has no reviews yet if its worth getting. That should help you make your decision where to spend your money."
5,it doesn't get any better than this...,"This campaign-length adventure module from TSR has been out-of-print for a long time, but if you can get your hands on a copy, do it! This is ""old-school"" AD&D - a long, epic adventure, with everything from trap-filled dungeons, through ancient artifacts and to scheming NPC's. My friend and I definitely remember this as one of the best adventures wev'e played, if not the best one. If you have a group that meets regularly, and are looking for a long adventure, buy it...if Amazon can find a copy for you..."
3,it's downloadable!!!,all the old goodies and many new ones are now avaibale for download at http://www.rpgnow.com !! go get 'em!!!!dave ;]
3,rock and rollin,i love j geils live albums and saw them live many times so i decided to get a studio album and like it very much
2,A mundane tale about a mundane family and their mundane lives...,"After having read the classics of Elmer Gantry, Free Air, Main Street and The Job, I was expecting a great deal more from Mr. Lewis. It was not to be. All of us show varying degrees of success in our professional endeavors. Being a writer is no exception to this simple rule. In this novel the characters are both flat and entirely uninteresting. The plot drags itself through communist agitation, the failure of parenting, into midlife crisis and escapism and finally into a milquetoast acceptance of one another. In sum, it starts no where, goes no where, and ends up no where.I suggest that if the reader wishes to explore Sinclair Lewis that he start with Elmer Gantry and proceed onto Main Street. The author's writings tend to slightly decline after this point. But with 'The Prodigal Parents' they seem to have fallen completely into an abyss...."
4,Kann einfach nicht genug davon kriegen!,"All I have to say about this CD, apart from it just being amazing, filled with tracks like ATB's ""Till I Come"" and 'Paraiso', the single best trait is the track by Red Light District 'Did You Hear Me'. I am seriously in love with this song, and recommend it to any one who hasn't heard it and loves dance musik. I am just rendered speachless and fall into a trance when this track is on....GET IT!"
5,"Top notch vocals, great harmony, where did they go?","Abandoned Luncheonette, not many albums in my collection have been bought so many times because they just wore out. The grooves just fill your day with beauty. Side A starts off with When the Morning Comes. Wow! If you like false setto with some punch hit the replay on this one. After this the record chills a bit. The next two songs ""Had I known You Better"" and Los Vegas Turn Around"" respectively, are simply exqusite examples of the music we can only dream of any more. The sweeping harmonies are perfect! Side B, starting with the title track moves a bit faster but isn't quite as memorable. Still worthy of a listen though."
4,Past Blast,"Workable, wonderful and delivered as promised. Nothing fancy but a blast from the past. I'd been looking for this album on CD for some 15 years. Great price, good service and good quality."
5,"They got rhythm, they got blues, and they sound pretty, too","Even though most of their best work was produced during their pop period in the 1980s, they never topped ""Abandoned Luncheonette."" The production is clean, but not spotless. The songs flaunt their R&B influences, but also rock. They have soul, they have purpose--and for the first time, it sounds like these guys are less concerned with making a catchy song and more concerned with really expressing something. ""She's Gone"" was probably the strongest single they ever released. The entire first side is comprised of breezy gems; ""When the Morning Comes"" is a surprisingly strong opening, and ""Las Vegas Turnaround"" is the most addictively cheery piece they ever composed. The best piece is probably the title track, though, which has four different portions of very different structures and time signatures and a whopping sound and purpose: it really hits the nail on the head. Or in this case, the key on the cash."
4,Great Early Hall & Oates,"If you're expecting the 80's Hall & Oates, move on to Voices or Big Bam Boom. If you're interested in how they got there, this one's for you. Funny: I always thought the name of this was ""Abandoned Luncheonmeat."" I guess I wasn't so cultured as a youngin'"
4,An early Hall & Oates classic.....,"It is highly likely that you would want to buy this album to build your complete collection of Hall & Oates music. However, for those people who discovered Hall & Oates around the ""Maneater"" days, you may be very disappointed to hear the more folksy feel of this album. The only song that shows the promise of the White Philly Soul sound that was to come is the classic track, She's Gone. If you know that, you will appreciate the music on this album - but if you like Hall & Oates only for the 80s pop sound that came with later albums, this one will probably gather dust on your CD rack. Great album - but just be aware of the era in which it was made."
3,Shipping NOT negotible,"I ordered 3 CDs from this vendor. CD is great and came quickly. However, even though they were all shipped together, I was charged three separate fees. I tried to negotiate for a better rate. The vendor said Amazon set the fee. Amazon says the vendor is free to negotiate a group rate. Bottom line, Amazon and vendor hid behind each other. Well I guess they need each other."
4,Nice to finally have found it.,"I never had found this in a store so it was nice to finally be able to get it here. The extra song versions are a nice addition to the ""album."" Unfortunately this doesn't play on my my Dell work laptop, even though I listen to CDs all day long. I am able to hear it on all other CD players - a Toshiba laptop, combo CD / DVD player, and in the car, though."
3,Funkay!,"This is probably my least favorite album of his just for the fact that I don't really care for Funk. But man his visuals he has for the Welcome to My Nightmare tour are just amazing and makes the songs come alive, literally. After buying and watching the tour, it made me appreciate this album even more. For those who don't really care for this record, give the concert DVD a try, it will blow you away!"
5,Thank you Rhino!!!!!!!,"The sound of this CD is incredible!!! It even surpasses, (in my opinion,) the Mobile Fidelity vinyl pressing!!! Thats huge coming from me, (Im a die hard vinyl/analog guy!)Although not as ""deluxe"" as the B$B reissue, the 3 extra tracks are great, and fit perfectly into the concept (nightmare,) of the original album.Keep it up Rhino!!!(I love to talk Alice! dadaalice@hotmail.com)"
5,ALICE TAUGHT ME TO ROCK,"Omigod, it was 1974, and I went to my very first rock concert at the Orange County Pavilion or something in Southern California. It was ""Welcome To My Nightmare"", and I FELL IN LOVE! Of course, I bought the album, memorized it, but somehow lost track of it many years ago. Now, On Oct. 29th, I am going to see Alice Cooper again at the Konocti Vista Resort in Northern California. So I came aboard to find my old favorite...I can't wait to hear the tunes again! And I am really looking forward to the extra tracks. OOHH! And the Concert is a costume event, so I am going to dress as Alice in Wonderland, but with Alice Cooper makeup. I'll be Alice Cooper in Wonderland! Get It!? lol"
4,Classic alice record,"Welcome to my nightmare is a really classic alice record that is hailed as a masterpiece by most of his fans,,,,and maybe his most appriciated solo-record. In my opinion it's a bit, but just a bit over-rated. It is not the ultimate alice record if you look at the specific songs themselfs, outtaken from it's whole. But that's not the point here anyway. It's not as great as ""Billin dollar babies"" and ""from the inside"" but it is definately a great album and a must for the hardcore Alice-fan. In the suberb opening track Alice welcomes you to the trip through his nightmare and you just need to sit back and enjoy. The highlights of this album is ""welcome to my nigthmare"" ""devils food"" ""cold ethyl"" ""the awakening"" and of course the brilliant ""only women bleed"" which is one of the best alice songs of all time......but as i said, this is not an album to pick out songs from. Enjoy the nightmare fram the first tune to the last as it is meant. ALICE COOPER IS GOD."
1,Unplayable. DRM?,"I wanted to give this disk 5 stars. I really did. Unfortunately it is unplayable on either one of my computers. That's right, it just spins for a bit and gets spit right back out. You see I could have bought this from another service (I'm sure you can guess which one) but their version replaced some full length songs with the shorter singles versions. Classic cuts like this shouldn't be cut short. Short is better than nothing though. I'm afraid I've run into Atlantic Records dreaded DRM practices with this disk. I've basically purchased a worthless product. I can't play it in the format I purchased it it. At the least I'd call it defective. At the worst I'd call it fraud."
5,An intresting Piece,"Either Love it or Hate it, this album is truly a must have in any collection. But yes, buy the CD so you can get the full version of the song Welcome to My Nightmare, not the silly single format. My favorite song off this record was The Black Widow, just saying, haha."
5,Welcome To My Nightmare - Remastered,"For any Alice fan...this CD is a MUST HAVE.The sound quality is better than its predecessor, plus you get three bonus tracks (actually, from the Alice video ""The Nightmare"""
3,showtunes,"After breaking up with the Alice Cooper group, and going solo, Alice hired a band with, effectively, no musical limitations. These guys could literally play anything. And so Alice pretty much let the theatricality take over. The result is the soundtrack to a Broadway show that never was: the best marriage of hard rock and showtunes ever. Listen to ""Black Widow"" for example. The song itself is pure Broadway, but the instrumentation is pure heavy metal. Alice was showing his love for showtunes as early as ""Easy Action"" the Alice Cooper group's second album, which featured a medley of snippets from ""West Side Story."" This West Side Story theme would be reprised in greater depth on ""School's Out"" (the Alice Cooper group's worst album.) But on this album he really marries hard rock and musical theatre. Many of these songs were probably written with the costumes, props and dance routines of the live show already in mind."
2,A Reader,"Although the author surely has good intentions, his efforts result in an overly simplistic book. Surely one can combine faith with intellectual integrity at a more compelling and challenging level."
1,Pap,"Authors should be forced to be honest in packaging their product. This book surely is a reworking of some nice, inoffensive Sunday sermons. One would be challenged to find anything new in it. Preachers, especially, need to resist the temptation to write (or at least publish) books if they have little or nothing to say. Mr. Colglazier must surely be a nice man, but that must surely be about it."
5,the place to start....,"this is where to start exploring the booming voice of Laura Branigan....best include ""living a lie"", ""down like a rock"", ""lovin' you baby"", ""gloria"" and ""all nite with me""...and more....a very entertaining vocalist!"
3,Branigan's First,"The late Laura Branigan's debut album is best known for the monster hit ""Gloria"". With it's soaring synth beat, the song pumped and kicked its way all the way up to number two on the charts in late 1982. It was the second single frm the album. Her debut single ""All Night With Me"" was released earlier in the year and is a straight bland ballad. It's lifeless compared to the sheer joy of ""Gloria""."
5,Great puzzle!,"I love jigsaw puzzles and this has been one of the more fun ones to put together. As a Van Gogh fan, this picture has special meaning for me. But on top of the great image, the puzzle is well created. It's rather complicated since it is very colorful but I love the challenge. The pieces fit nice and tight unlike some other puzzles. This is definitely a keeper and I cannot wait to finish it and glue it together to display on a wall."
1,Bad,"Bad. you can get the air bubbles out it you have a clean and scratch-free screen, but these screen protectors are horrible. They scratch so quickly that you'll be replacing them within a couple of weeks. Get the Pelican Invisi-shields if you can find them, they last incredibly long"
1,A disappointment,These guys were a let down. There was nothing exception or original about their style or ability. Save your money and buy something from the hacks playing in the garage down the street
4,Elegant work,"To read Shirley Hazzard is to venture into times and spaces restricted by social mores. Evocative of Edith Wharton, her characters are ensnared by the prevailing right and wrong of the times in which they live. In this case, it is post World War II Italy. With an economy of words, she paints a magnificent sense of place, imbues it with ordinary people and requires them to make life altering decisions.Unlike contemporary writers, Hazzard does not pin every detail on the page - readers are required to think. There is always an elegance in Hazzard's work, even in this early, straightforward novel."
2,"Tender, slender","Shirley Hazzard's first novel reads very much like a first novel. She has a fruitful set-up--an Englishwoman, of half-Italian parentage, falls in love with an older and more sophisticated Italian man separated from his wife--, but she cannot figure out what to do with it. The individual scenes in this episodic narrative are sometimes beautifully evocative, but nothing much ever comes of the story. You never feel very much is at stake between the two lovers since their affair does not convince. The whole thing sifts out of your memory almost as soon as you've finished it."
3,"Elegant, sophisticated writing","Beautiful, evocative descriptions abound in this work set in Tuscany.A romance gradually kindles between middle aged, married Tancredi and young Sophia, to a backdrop of 1950s (?) Italy. I was particularly struck by the chapter where Sophia has arranged to meet him outside a town where a fiesta is taking place and where the vividly rendered procession means she is hemmed in and fears she will miss him.Classy style, but like another reviewer, I must agree that it doesn't leave any lasting impression."
5,The most brilliant film I've seen in a long time.,"The historical accuracy is marvelous. This film should have swept the Oscars, but no one I know had evern heard of it. I think it is much better than Shakespeare in love. Bully Crudup is sensational. The directing is fantastic. The screen play is one of the best I've seen. I am proud to have it in my collection."
5,When theatre had the attraction that the internet has today.,"This film is really pure entertainment but also a delightful window on Shakespearian theatre in the 17th century. Its a story of the sexism and disempowerment, of the transience of fame, its a wonderful historical account of a colorful time in history when theatre had the attraction that the internet has today, and its a love story. But its a love story about one's profession and about unrequited love, and there's plenty in there for straight and gay men alike to enjoy this film. It's also about competition, admiration, inspiration and friendship. A truly enjoyable and charming film with a real story line."
3,"""A woman playing a woman? Where's the trick in that? ""","I have been a fan of Billy Crudup's for awhile and I thought he was the only well cast person in this film and he is even lovely as a woman. Claire Danes really lacked a certain quality that would have made her 'star' quality, she always seems so bland. But I do have to give it to them for the final Death Scene. I felt they really captured the intensity of that scene.Rupert Everett as King Charles is silly and wimpy, and the mistress Nell, played my Zoe Tapper, is just ridiculous.All in all an entertaining watch."
3,Disappointment,"i was very upset after watching this film. with an all star cast i thought this movie was going to be great. however, the acting was not quite as great as it could have been and the story line was much weaker than i expected. i would recommend watching this film if you like one of the actors and want to see it, just to see it. other than that this film is hardly worth the rental."
3,Bit hard to hang...,I was trying to hang a slightly thinner sword and the large size make sgetting the hangers close enough a little awkward also having the holes directly behind the shield makes it hard to drive the screws. After fussing with them a bit they are holding the swords nicely and look great. more time on the design and function would be nice.
5,Very nice for the $$$,"I am not a big gamer or anything, but the graphics are very adequate for what I use my computer for. I have read that these cards have a loud fan, but I don't notice that it is unusually loud."
4,Good product,"Nice graphics for the price. Had some minor problems with getting it to work on my pc, but customer service was very helpful and prompt with responding to and fixing the problem."
3,The Velveteen Rabbit,"Having recently viewed again my copy of this 1985 version, I am impressed just how much better the 2004 version of ""The Velveteen Rabbit"" is from the same series. If you were to look at both, you would agree that the money spent to produce a new version was well worth it."
3,Interesting historically,"Interesting historically. The artist in the story is a combination of Manet, Monet, and Cezanne."
1,A really poor old translation,"If you can stand these public domain rip-offs, you'll love this book. It was one of Zola's weakest book by far, but putting a fancy cover on it and using a victorian british translation doesn't help matters. See the new versions put out by The Emile Zola Society if you want to appreciate Zola for the great writer he is and you cannot read French."
3,A point made,"""The Masterpiece"" is Zola's critical (as opposed to personal) attack on the painting styles of Manet and perhaps the Impressionists, the point being that here was a style in which it was impossible to paint one single painting that would stand as a salon masterpiece, apart from a series or greater body of work. The point is well made, but otherwise this is a depressing book that seems almost ridiculous at times in its representation of the tortured artist. In my opinion, this is a book that few women or Americans would be fond of, but it is thought-provoking for students of the period."
1,my opinion_a waste of money_this is not a regular movie.,"in my opinion,this is a no star!just a video with audio comentary after it was made.not a regular movie one would expect on dvd format.i was left feeling ripped off.i wonder why amazon.com would sell this type of dvd.i would like my money back."
4,Definitely worth viewing,"I loved this movie because it rang true, which all good comedy should.If for nothing else, watch it for some very funny one liners."
4,What a concept....,"Midwest meets LA....I enjoyed all the characters and can not wait to see the sequel. The lighting, filming, writing, and direction puts a wonderful, cute, funny, spin on an event that is not any of those things."
2,Disappointed! Two disc set with only one disc in sealed box!,"I thought this was a great deal, as these were movies I had wanted to order separately. When I opened the sealed package, however, I was very disappointed, as there was only one DVD with 2 movies, instead of 2 DVD's with the 4 movies shown on the front cover. I purchase with Amazon several times a month and usually am very satisfied but when something goes wrong like this, you can't reach anyone to even complain and let them know what happened! Very frustrating!"
1,Not for the hard of hearing,"I loved all of these movies when shown on TV. However, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment does not offer closed captioning nor sub-titles on these Christmas delights. That includes not only this edition, but other 4 in 1 Christmas movies they offer. A poor choice for someone like me, who is hard-of-hearing."
4,Good bargain,"Four OK Christmas films at a good price, when you are tired of all of the old standbys like A Wonderful Like, Miracle on 34th St, and the The Santa Clause this set will give you some other options. None of them really stand out but they won't spoil your day either.."
5,Holiday & Film Collector's Set DVD,All great movies! The best is you get 4 great holiday movies in one DVD. Highly recommended will touch your heart dearly!
4,Holiday Four-Film,Our family has enjoyed these shows. A touchingset of films that are heart warming and show themiracle of love.
3,moving films but not much Christmas meanings,"I love watching Christmas movies. These while moving and showing some time specific happening during the advent season, were somewhat disappointing in the fact that though they were almost tear jerkers, did not encompass the true Christmas spirit of Love beyond oneself. A couple of them came close, but still too much ""magic"" and not the regenerated true miracles that happens when God changes our soul, and thus blesses us with real Christmas Spirit, His Spirit."
2,Poor quality,"We bought this greenhouse two years ago. The first year it worked fine. We did notice rusting on the metal pieces, and a couple of the straps broke, but is stayed together. We took it down and stored it for winter, and second assembly did not go well. The plastic pieces became brittle, and many of them broke. We were able to get it together though, until we tried the skin. The remaining straps all broke, the anchors pulled out of the skin, and one of the zippers broke. So, we'll get two seasons out of it and it will have to go in the trash. I'd say avoid it. I'll be building coldframes the next time around and avoiding these cheap greenhouses."
5,WOW,"Tom Wright is amazing. He changed my Theology in Seminary (in a good way as ""N.T."" Wright and when he came to speak to Asbury) and now he amazes me with this easy to read and even easier to understand commentary set. I have only bought this one book, but will be saving up (as only a new pastor can) for the entire commentary set. Please find this book. Read page 100-104 about the mind of Christ (Philippians 2.5-11) section and realize how changed your life will be after reading this book. Thank you Tom! and God bless everyone who reads this review. (I hope it encourages you to find it in a librabry or book store, read it, and judge it for yourself)"
1,Not reliable.,"My first machine did not last a year and was very noisy with a loud clicking sound. I also found the filter dirty very quickly-and the motor is not enough power for a large space. I ended up returning one only to find that the next one arrived damaged. Finally on the third replacement I gave up and ordered a different model, which has just recently been sent back again. Whether it is this model or damage in shipping, the replacement of this purifier has turned out to be more trouble than it's worth. I like the company and continue to order products from them, but I would not recommend this product. I would also not recommend a permanent filter which always seems dirty even when vacuumed. Pay the extra money for a replaceable Hepa type filter-purifier-it is well worth it!"
1,bad merchandise,"I purchased this item because it was well priced and looked good. when i got it and put it on i noticed that it worked with the brakes on as advertised but, it worked with the right blinker and not the left. I called the company and they said that they knew about this and it was supposed to happen, which i find absoloutely ridiculous. So i then sent it back for a refund, still waiting on that though.."
4,A little secret...,"(...)Anyway, on to dopplanger. Really, its a great album by a great band. All I can really say is if you are wondering whether to buy this or not, first forget every comparison youve heard about fall of troy. there not really like any of their comparsions AT ALL. and i would say if you like one of their songs(from dopplanger), youll probably enjoy this cd because all of the songs are at least consistent, if not almost incredible. the style doesn't really change from song to song, but it is definetly different enough to keep you listening and on the edge. some people might not like their style, but for everyone else it would do you good to check out this cd."
2,wheres the feel bro?,God I hate screamo. This music ain't got no heart. Show me the passion and quit the pissin' folks.
4,Great,"This cd is amazing, this band is very talented. They are definately not just a rip off of The Mars Volta. And the guy who said the singer was imitating Omar? What is he doing, making guitar sounds with his voice? Cedric is the singer for the mars volta. Get your facts straight before you go bashing things. This album is fantastic except i feel the lyrics are a little underexposed because of the constant insanity of the music and the screamy style of the vocals. Still, this is a great album and worth buying."
4,wrong,"When they recorded the self titled, they were 18.18,17.When they were recording doppelganger in march, they were 20,19,and 19."
2,Eh...,"I checked these guys out after listening to The Mars Volta. The Fall of Troy are a lot like the former, but when you listen to enough unpredictable music, you can start to predict some of it, like Laces out Dan.Don't bother with this. Just listen to Mars Volta"
2,horrible band,"This band is by no means heavy metal or metalcore. If you love terrible high pitched screaming vocals by all means buy this album. It is horrible, and not worth buying, if anything dl it. The reason i give them 2 stars because the guitarwork is AMAZING! its hard to believe some of it can be done, but its sometimes so fast its annoying to listen too, it just doesnt sound good.Only good song in my opinion on this album is ""You got a death wish, Johnny Traunt?"", they should have made this the intro song.2 stars"
4,"Great service,great price,excellent condition!","The TIE bomber was offered at an extremely competitive price,and was in fine condition,looking just like it came off the store shelf.It arrived quite quickly and was well packed to insure no damage in transit."
3,The Solist,"Piano virtuoso Max Randall,has gone for years with the suspension of his career while his personal life grows more and more complex. His preparation for a comeback is disrupted by his many relations with the women whose roles in his life confuse him in his search for his self identity as a musician and a man. The book is written with great intensity and much soul searching as it is juxtaposed against the preparation to return to the concert stage. This book is not only a tome with which most musicians will identify. It also represents the struggle of a man who is searching to find himself in the midst of all his life's turmoil and chaos. It is imbued with a sense of such authenticity that I had to question what seemed to me like an autobiographical portrayal of the author's own life. This is a book with which musicians will identify but it is also a book that depicts artist's life as an ordinary person struggling for perfection.Louise CabralAuthor,Teacher,Speaker[...]."
1,"I accept ""cronehood"" - but I reject witchcraft","Different strokes for different folks, for sure. So if you're ready to dabble in ""the craft,"" then buy this book. But if your definition of ""practical advice"" does not include candles, herbal potions, and ""spells"" to invoke spirits, then don't rely on Amazon's vague description of this book. And don't buy it."
3,Good but needs improvement.,"I am a contractor and own 2 of these saws. I have had 2 replaced in the last year because of broken blade bevel mechanisms. The reason is that the gears are plastic and packed with grease that subsequently fill with sawdust and jamb when you try to bevel the blade to 45 deg. I still own the old reliable Makita 8 1/4"" # 2708, never a problem, except the cord getting a little old and frayed. Makita should have stuck with the tried and true design on the bevel and changed only the blade raising handle to a crank (as in the 2703). It's still a good saw, especially when you drop it in a Rousseau stand, I just wish Makita would get rid of the plastic gears."
3,The fence,"I have this saw. I mainly bought it because of it's rip capicity, and it does a great job ripping slices off a 4X4 post. The only problem is the fence. The fence ... Every time I move the saw I have to set the fence up again. If I make it tight enough so that the back holds it will not align properly. If it loose enough to align properly the back is not locked down. If Makita would put a better fence on it you couldn't beat it."
2,Don't Buy The Stand,"I love the saw and would give it a 4 star rating. Light and accurate.The stand however is a rip off. It isn't any different than the $20 Black & Decker version you can readily buy. It is clunky, the rubber feet fall off immediately and it doesn't even come with the hardware to mount the saw on the stand."
3,"Good table saw, but...","I bought this saw about two years ago and have been pleased with its performance for the most part. Light weight and well built, the Makita performs most cutting jobs with ease. It does have two very frustrating negatives about it, though.By far the biggest fault with the saw is the rip fence. It is never accurate when it is tightened down on the table. As the locking mechanism grabs the front of the table, the opposite end of the fence loosens and strays from square. I have to use a long Try square to align the fence at the rear of the table while very carefully tightening the lock to the front. More often than not, the mechanism pulls the front of the fence away from the Try square and I'm back to where I started.The other problem with this saw is Makita's use of a non standard size miter gauge slot. This makes it so one can not use any of the really wonderful attachments available to the woodworker.If I could do it over, I'd spend the extra money on a DeWalt."
4,"Makita Portable 10""","A great saw, especially at the sale price. Makita always has produced durable tools and this is will be no exception. Little vibration with good depth for thicker stock. Hard to beat for a small portable unit. Buy the ""table"" to add ease in use."
4,great for lasagna,"I debated the merits of a cast iron versus a stoneware baker with the sales person at Le Creuset, and her recommendation of cast iron ws on the mark. I use this pan mostly for lasagna. While some complain of its weight, the even heating and heat retention are worth it."
3,Disappointing,"I have ""Chester and Lester"" and love it and was looking for more of the same from these two great Masters. Few of the songs rate better than 3 for my iPod list. Listen to the songs before buying the CD."
1,Poor everything,"There is no voice for the ""Cat in the Hat"" or any other game figure. Just this annoying music. I found it hard for me to complete the first level. I would recommend no earlier than 10 yrs. old."
3,"Basic introductory book, lacking some detail",This book is a basic introductory book for beginning residents and maybe useful for some general pathologists. It lacks a lot of detail needed if you regularly interpret lymph node biopsies. It is definitely not a replacement for Ioachim's book. The picture quality is mediocre. It does provide good summaries of all of the most common major reactive and malignant conditions involving lymph nodes. Overall more detailed review of lymph node pathology than a general surgical pathology book (Rosai or Sternberg) but lacks the detail of Ioachim's.
2,Compaq support,"My S4 100 scanner is only about 6 months old. It will only scan in a sort of pinkish/red color, although up to this point, it worked fine. I called Compaq support and received NO HELP. Their representative informed me that my warranty was up and that they could do no further troubleshooting for me. I think this is very bad customer service and just thought I would let you know."
1,S4-100 Scanner No Good on Windows XP,"Don't buy this scanner if you have any interest in the new XP operating system. It only works with the basic functions under the new WIA interface, and does NOT work at all with the included Vistascan software, including the one button functions like copy. Also Compaq barely knows that this scanner even exists, and UMAX (it's a 3400) drivers don't work either.Bad, bad, bad."
3,complience,The S4 100 color Usb Scanner works fine on window 98 and below but is not fully functional on windows XP Home addition. the scanner operating buttons become non operational and you have to use other programs like Pagis Pro to scan items and then using that program to print or save. The scanner will not work by its self from its control buttons. The technical data has not been posted as to feather or not this scanner is XP supported
1,Unhappy compaq customer!!,I purchased a Compaq S 4 100 scanner from Sears on 9/16/01 and now I cannot get the scanner to e-mail anything for me. Have it install properly and can scan things but cannot e-mail. Cannot get ANY help without a charge. I paid $... at Sears for the scanner and WILL not pay another $30 or $40 to get help in making it work!! I will take it back and give Compaq a BAD name for their product. I have a Compaq PC and Printer and so far have been satisfied with them. The SCANNER IS GOING BACK! Am very unhappy with Compaq. The Scanner is not an easy one to operate anyway. After hours with someone that knows computers we did get it to scan but never to e-mail. Will get another one but never again a COMPAQ. Signed: VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER
2,"Scanner is good with Windows, not XP","We have had the scanner 4 years and it worked well without much problem. We had to pay someone to instlal the software when we first got it and the buttons never worked. But it scanned good pictures. Color scans of black and white pictures did come out with a blueish cast. We didn't have a lot of problems until we bought a new computer with XP. Then the software that came with the scanner wouldn't work. We had to get another program from the internet to make the scanner work. Now if I didn't use the scanner yesterday, it takes the computer 45 minutes to find the scanner. If I used it yesterday, it takes about 10 minutes. I know the scanner works well but am considering buying another scanner more compatible with XP. Is that necessary or is there some way to get it to work with XP?"
2,"Average scanner, poor support","This isn't a horrible scanner. The only problems I have arereally with the software and support offered with it. Compaq reallyis not good atsupporting the majority of their hardware, and their scanner is no exception. They don't even provide the proper drivers on their web site. The only way to get it up and running is via the CD that comes with it, which forces it's own software on you, which did not work well on my computer at all! Large (full-page) scans would always freeze my system, even in Windows 2000; and every few weeks I have to remove the device from my Device Manager and re-install it, because it simply stops working and needs to be refreshed. When it works, it works fine, but it's usually a pain and Compaq is of no help..."
2,Unacceptable indoors,"I bought this camcorder despite concerns about poor indoor performance with the thought that if I tape indoors I'll just turn up the lights. Doesn't work. The amount of graininess is simply unacceptable, and seems to be accentuated on my 32"" HDTV. No adjustments to the camera could remedy this. It's embarrassing to show this when my 11 year old Sony Hi8 camcorder does such a better job."
1,Waste.,"This thing won't hold a charge, and JVC won't ship a new battery. Same as other reviews - it's your problem not theirs. Never even got to a point where I could experience the condensation problem. I can tape with it plugged in to the wall, but that's it. Otherwise, it's an expensive door jamb. I'm getting a Sony next, since my little Sony digital camera is working great, even after being put through some tough situations (dropped on concrete multiple times etc)."
2,camera does not work after only three uses,I purchased my camera refurbished and already I cannot get a picture from any live source. I only get playback from tapes already recorded. I am not happy at all with this product or purchase.
1,Save your Money,"I purchased this JVC GR-D90 camera on Amazon.com used it four times and it died, just like everybody else. This can only lead me to believe that the JVC Brands are unreliable. What a waste of money. I think I will try a Sony next time. I have lost all trust in the JVC brand name. If you are smart do waste your money."
3,Just doesn't shoot well indoors,"I wanted a camcorder that had quiet motor noise and could shoot well indoors. The noise was acceptable but indoor shots were very grainy. You had to crank up the lamps in order to get an acceptable shot. Loved the 3.5"" display though. Returned to CC and got the Canon ZR70. Returned that as well. Read review."
1,"BEWARE, many flaws with this product.","I bought this hoping that i would get a decent camcorder that worked. Well unfortunately it worked for about two or three weeks and it died. The battery was fully charged and i took very good care of it, still it is now a paperweight, since i lost my reicept i'm out the cash. Don't make the same mistake i did. And the quality of the indoor shooting sucks as well"
2,Missing Something.,"I didn't get as excited about this book as the other reviewers have. I did not get much out of this book. The author is trying to blend the fantasy with the real, and it somehow misses the mark. I understand the metaphor of the ""waking dead"" and how she tries to juxtapose merely being alive with living life. But it just doesn't stir me. Something seems to be missing. I don't think the book is a waste of time, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, either."
5,Excellent rolling bag,"My son has been using this bag for about 18 months, since he was in 4th grade. He was lugging heavy books, flute, lunch bag. It is a sturdy bag, do not bother to buy those cheap $20 or under rolling backpack, you get what you pay for! Invest in this one and it will last for a couple of school years. We couldn't be happier with it."
5,Excellent bag,I believe this is excellent bag.It is quite bigger than expected to be... but if you travel a lot... this saves your back from pain...I bought it to use it as an everyday bag to go to the University and Bag but it is much bigger than what I want to carry with me.
3,"Great Wheelie, but.....","This Jansport Hemi has lots of storage, very strong and stylish.Not a great choice however for my 11 year old as it dosen't haveany straps. Not a TRUE back pack. Just a handle on top.Better for a commuter or an adult that won't mind picking it up."
1,Misleading advertising by Amazon,"This bag is advertized as a ""Wheeled Backpack"" - but it is not a backpack. It is just a wheeled daypack. There are no ""backpack"" straps along with the wheels and handle, like on other bags considered a wheeled backpack. I feel like I was misled by the item description, and purchased this expecting a pack that could be pulled as well as carried on a back. When I asked Amazon to refund my shipping fees because of an advertising error, they never responded. Disappointing...."
4,inexpensive meal,"The Oriental Flavor Ramen Noodles taste okay but I almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome. I prepare it by adding sesame seed oil, vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils. Rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles."
4,good radi a must buy!,i just bought this and it works like a charm....it is the best for thoose people who need to wake with a quiet alarm so you wont wake others...this is the best!!
4,"Great value, but no carry case","4-1/2 stars. This is an awesome value, but be informed that there is no carrying case as it was originally advertised in the description. The two tools and their accessories that are described were packaged together in a DeWalt cardboard box. I am quite certain they are both new and not remanufactured. I personally like the DeWalt biscuit joiner better for its size - - the PC version is such a large unit in comparison - - consider this if you have a small home workshop. I was able to fit my DeWalt biscuit joiner into a plastic Craftsman toolbox I had at home, to use as a storage case."
2,False description,"Contrary to the description above, this dvd does not feature any of the originally broadcast jungle survival segments presented by Mykel Hawke. For some reason, Discovery channel, in all their infinite wisdom, have decided it would be for the best if they remove these parts entirely, so they can only be watched in low resolution on youtube. Thanks guys!"
4,Note from the Director,"Since I made this documentary I can't give an unbiased review, but I can say that many people have found it a hilarious and offbeat collection of great and not-so-great tribute bands. Bands that are tributed include MOTLEY CRUE, DEF LEPPARD, BILLY IDOL, THE WHO, RUSH, KISS, THE ROLLING STONES, BLACK SABBATH, YES, DEAD BOYS, RUNAWAYS, DEVO, GUIDED BY VOICES, JIMI HENDRIX, ELVIS PRESLEY, LED ZEPPELIN, HERB ALPERT & THE TIJUANA BRASS, T REX. The documentary is over 70 minutes long, and extras include 20 short performances, director's commentary, and several slideshows. Guaranteed to please any rock music fan with a sense of humor!"
3,A filmic dissertation,"TRIBUTARY and AN INCREDIBLE SIMULATION originally began as one project as conceived by Russ Forester, Darren Hacker, and Jeff Economy. However, creative differences caused a rift between the parties, resulting in two half-baked projects that share footage and, ultimately, share faults.In TRIBUTARY, Forester's on-screen introduction gives the impression that the filmmaker will be the viewers' conduit to information via either voice-over narration or interviews. Forester would have done well to embrace a more personal interface. Rather, the film has the structure and cold classification of a term paper. Forester presents four perceived groups of tribute bands. This taxonomy feels arbitrary at best and strained at worst. Yet, that Forester employed any structure at all puts TRIBUTARY heads above AN INCREDIBLE SIMULATION."
5,Great Product,This hat has worn great. I am very happy with this product. You get what you see. I would recommend this product!
5,Great Hat!,"Awesome hat, exactly what I wanted. Had the Velcro back so I could adjust it if needed, overall it was a great buy."
3,Cute but fussy,"I wore this under my wedding dress as my ""something blue."" While it is super sexy and comfortable I found that the weight of my dress and the pull of the stockings made it a bit fussy to wear and I had a few ""wardrobe malfunctions"" when I had to sneak off and pull my undies/garter belt back up.If you are just wearing this is the bedroom, however, or not for very long at a time, it is VERY sexy and comfy and will probably work just fine"
1,May not play in the US,I ordered another DVD from this seller which said it was NTSC but it is PAL and won't play on most DVD players in the US. Get the specifics before ordering!!!!!
4,There&#65533;s something strange about Friar Tuck he&#65533;s...,"There's something strange about Friar Tuck Golden Boy, he's blind. Tuck has a seeing eye dog named Lady Diasy. Tuck and Daisy took a real liking to the adopted boy Chok-do. Chok-do is from Korea and is a deaf-mute. Helen, which is the owner of Tuck and Daisy is getting jealous of Chok-do but that may not last to long. After adopting the six year old Korean boy that could not speak nor hear he seemed hard to keep. So, what is the choice made. You have to read to find out. by Steve"
4,Tuck Triumphant is a great book and I would recommend.,"Tuck TriumphantTuck Triumphant is a great book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes dogs. This book was interesting because of the tragedies, happiness, and frightfulness. I liked when Helen got back Tuck after he ran away with Chok-do. The characters are really realistic. The book sounded like it could really happen. Since Chok-do is deaf and they're not sure if they want to keep him. Lady Daisy was injured, but you have to read it to find out #1: Do they keep Chok-do? #2 What happens to Lady Daisy?By: Aaron"
2,Cheaply made.,"No instructions came with it, it was difficult to install the batteries and the small wrist strap. It appears to work well but I am hesitant to drop it or put it in some water due to the ""plastic"" quality of the flashlight."
5,"Deep, simple, wonderful","There is a hermitage within each of us - it is the inner room Jesus spoke of. This book does not just tell how to find it, or dabble around the edges, but takes us directly into the heart of this hermitage. He takes us into the inner rooms of St. Paul, Mary Magdalen, Jesus, to the tops of the Mounts of the Bible, Sinai, Tabor, Olives, and more. It is loaded with Scripture. It is loaded with experience.This is a great book. It will teach you much, and if you are truly seeking God, you will love it as much as I do!Review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God"
3,Protests!!!,"This book was very informative but not as good as ""The Battle of Otok"" concerning political turmoil of the time."
2,Good look at culture... but not for every audience,"Although I agree that this portrays very moving look at the Bronx in a way that brings it to life for the outsider, this is NOT a book for the school market! It opens too many issues for moral controversy."
4,Christmas--the Rockabilly Way!,"Rated last year as one of the LA Times' top ten Christmas albums, this compilation is destined to become a Rockabilly classic. It's a fun twist on holiday classics and the song especially written by Ms. Flores about her childhood home in San Antonio, Texas is bound to capture your heart. It's a must in your holiday collection."
3,"Disputing ""Beyond Dispute""","I am an average person. I read Beer's ""Brain of the Firm"" back in 1981, and have been a fan since. And yes, I am familiar with Fuller, have built my share of domes and tensegrity models. But this book lost me early on, despite several attempts.OK, so geodesics was (again) borne out by Buckyballs. What I never got was *why* team interactions are best mapped or modeled by convex polyhedra. Why? It was just as easy to conclude that he arbitrarily selected the icosahedron because it is fascinating.Do synergy and reverberation really exist in group dynamics? Or is he just ascribing those names? It was never clear to me.In fairness, I haven't read the epilogue. Let me just say that this is a *difficult* book, even if you are already know Gurdjieff, Euler and the whole pantheon."
1,Terrible Printer,"When I first got this Compaq printer it worked well. That only lasted about a month. After that when I tried to print anything color it would print in visible stripes. Cleaning the print heads only helped for maybe a day and then it was back to the stripes again. In addition to it's bad quality printing the ink is overpriced. I would recommend a Canon printer instead. They are cheap and work great. I own two and have never had a problem with them. Plus, they print great photos."
5,Great Glute-Free Noodles!,My six year old son has Celiac disease. He loves these noodles and always asks me to make them for him. He likes them just plain or with sauce or cheese added.
5,One of the BEST books in existence today,"Jesse experience being caught up in heaven, taking a tour around and reaching the very throne of God is an awsome and wonderful love letter from God to us in these last days. If you're looking for a preview of life in heaven - this is it. It has amplified my focus on things above where Christ is seated - yet reminds me not to forget to tell people down here about the gospel and his soon return. I liked the part where Jesus preached in front at the throne of God, the conversations with Abraham, David, Paul, Jonah, and most of all with Jesus himself.You will share in the sorrow of Jesus for the lost and some of you may even find yourselves in full-time ministry after reading this book.There are only a few books that you will read over again - this is one of them. If you're hungry for more of these - also try ""Didn't you Read my Book"" - Richard Eby and ""The heavens opened"" - Anna Roundtree, I hope Rick Joyner's book arrives from mail soon."
5,Heaven-Close encounters of the God Kind,"I bought this for a friend after reading it. This friend lost a son at an early age and it helped her and I, both, to see how real Heaven is because of Jesse's visitation there."
5,A look at Heaven with out being 6 feet under.. A Great book.,"This is a Great book for everyone. It gives you a message, it also gives you a look a Heaven with out you being 6 feet under. The book is great, funny and comes with the best message of all, words can't describe this book it's Great.. GLORY TO GOD!!!!"
5,Dr. Duplantis Is The Real Deal,I've had a close in counter of the God kind my self . Long before I had ever knew who Jesse Duplantis was. Then once I was shown his message and later this book it blew my mind because his experince matched mine perfectly.This man does more for God than anyone I've ever known and lives life as a Christian not as someone who just go's to church. Anyone that tries to use small parts of scripture to go against this man need to read the whole book they are taking that verse from. Because they are missing the mark. Trust me I work in ministry and have many years experince and knowlage to back me up on this. I am not trying to be rude to the other reviewers as I know they are just standing by what they feel. But I felt that such people may turn people off from making an informed choice on reading this book.Any way I highly recommend this book to all who want to know God better because it gives you an insight into things many may never experince.
4,HEAVEN,"I first bought this book not long after it was first published. Several times I loaned it out before it 'disappeared'. Then my oldest daughter bought one for herself after reading mine. Hers after a time, 'disappeared' as well. The book has 'haunted' me with its beauty and perception of a place we learn, often as little children in 'Sunday School', as the place we go when our time on earth has finiahed. But Jesse Duplantis brings a reality to this wonderful place. Everyone should read this book at least once."
1,Horrible,"Its amazing that people can read this garbage and believe it. It doesnt take a biblical scholar to figure out the foolishness of this book and of Duplantis' teachings in general. Typical Charismatic mumbo jumbo, everybody is in competition of having some supernatural experience just to make themselves more ""spiritual"" than others. You want to read a good book?""The Gospel according to Jesus"" by John MacArthur. Basic fundamental truth, not fantasy."
1,YELL BROTHERS AND SISTERS!!!!,"That's what God wants you to do! Watch as Duplantis struts back and forth on the stage with his catchy, trite little sayings while saying that he is believing God for this ""intercontinental piece of a equipment!"" (A lear jet) Then watch as the people he touches begin, eyes rolling back in their head, falling to the ground in hysterics. GO JESSE GO!! Louder! Faster! ""Are y'all listenin to ol Jesse? Somebody shout an Amen!"" GLOW-RY to gawd!!! Just a good ol Louisiana boy preaching that old time religion and raking the money in with both hands. Just keep on a-yellin' Jesse and maybe they won't notice. Hallelujah...yeah."
5,"Lock up your cattle, the Ulstermen are here.","This is a literary masterpiece to match the 5th(?) century manuscript: action, adventure, deceit, love, death, life, marriage, and hurling! What more could I ask for? Kinsella manages to pull you into the past of Ireland without loosing the flavor and excitement of the original epic. No pansy 19th century Victorian mush here, Mrs. Brown. This is the raw thing, the Irish story of how a hero was created.I grew tired of reading German translations of Old Irish stories, for lack of anything worthwhile in English. Too frequently, translators spend their time getting the exact meaning of each word, only to loose the beauty and flavor of the original melange.Kinsella comes through like a mighty warrior of the Uliad out of the distant past. Slainte!"
4,Useful and nicely written,"The Tain is an important resource for anyone interested in ancient Ireland, offering tantalizing insights into a history and culture that will forever remain mysterious. This translation is readable and accessible. I didn't find that the illustrations added much - as a history geek, I would have preferred more technical illustrations that showed me what these people wore, how their houses looked, etc. Still, this should be part of any Celtophile's library."
3,An old story translated into Modern English,"This book is good if you're interested in old Irish and Celtic mythology. However general audiences will probably be frustrated by dissonant storyline and the confusing lists of names and locations. The story's excitement did not live up to my expectations. It is hard to follow and its hard to make sense of what the characters are doing. It seems more like a story told by a bard to an audience of ancient Irish men and women than a story for modern readers. The translator kept true to the original text, but lost readibility along the way."
2,Translation of mythology,Lots of killing but not a very deep story and it just keeps going and going.
1,"TERRIBLE PRODUCT, Only good for mixing non-viscous liquids!!!!","Bought this Cuisinart hand blender to blend up protein shakes and it worked fine for JUST protein powder and water. HOWEVER, adding even a banana, this thing fails miserably. ALSO, on my second attempt to blend BANANAS in with milk, the blade detached from the drive shaft and therefore it will no longer function (blade doesnt spin). Overall a TERRIBLE PRODUCT, something I would expect from say black-n-decker or something, but NOT Cuisinart...."
1,Cuisinart quality?,"I cannot comment on the actual performance of this item because after 1-2 minutes of smooth operation, it began making a loud chattering sound accompanied by a vibration and a strong metallic odor which emanated from the machine. I know that bearings sometimes fail prematurely, but this item certainly did not meet the high standard of excellence that I associate with the brand. Also, nowhere, not on the box, not in the manual, not in the description on the Cuisinart site nor Amazon could I find the wattage of this blender. Perhaps it is so weak that no one wants to admit it?"
2,Cuisinart CSB-33 QuikPrep Hand Blender,"Clear instructions and recipes are included with the blender?No way. My wife bought it at a local store, & there wasn't any such thing included."
2,"Poor performance, clumsy, hard to wash","Well, I suppose it would work okay if you are literally just mixing protein powder with water, or making a milkshake.If you want to blend anything with chunks, not so much. Even trying to blend soups with well cooked vegetables is time consuming and frustrating- often chunks get caught above the blades and it doesn't create enough suction to pull food through it. Anything raw? Forget it. The blades are dull, the motor is weak, and it's kind of uncomfortable to hold because you have to manually hold the button down while blending. The blender part doesn't detach from the motor part, so it's awkward to clean.I got it as a gift, so it's too late for me, but you should save your money and skip this one."
2,Waste of Time,"What is this thing suppose to do? I throw some fresh strawberries, bananas, ice and juice into the cup and end up with a cup of clumps and ice cubes... Nothing gets chopped. It jams up with everything. The motor sounds like it's going to quit and the blade stops running as soon as anything gets stuck in it. Total junk. Returning it. The only reason I gave it two stars is because my husband likes it to make ice cream shakes. So it smooths ice cream, big deal, I can do it by hand just as easily."
5,Good Value for the Price,"What a useful little blender/chopper! Much better than the old electric hand blender I used to own. I had the kind with two ""beaters"" that would spin. The mixer would often cause liquids to spray. The cuisinart csb-33 hand mixer's design prevents liquids from spraying and it's very easy to clean. Just a quick rinse under in some hot soapy water is all it needs.I would definitely recommend this for anyone."
5,hand blender,"We had a similar one while living in Spain; this one works just as well, has a cup with it, & is also our favorite color!"
2,Go for the KitchenAid Immersion Blender instead,"I bought the Cuisinart Immersion blender a year and a half ago, and used it 2-3 times a week with passable (if noisy and slighly lumpy) results, until it died last week. I was pleased with my Cuisnart until I replaced it with the KitchenAid Immersion blender. This thing ROCKS. It's quieter, twice as powerful (check the amps!), has nine speeds AND a detachable blade arm for easy, submersable, cleanup. Best of all, it leaves no lumps. You can taste the difference!"
2,A big BOOM,"I had this hand blender when it came with the stainless steel beaker cup (which I did keep), the plastic beaker, lid, chopper & 3 blades. I loved all the gadgets & gizmos it came with. It was very nice to start, but once I started chopping fresh fruits...BOOM! --Sounded like a gun went off! It died. Maybe they are different now? hmmm...sounds like the motor hasn't improved too much though.I'll just stick with Cuisenart's bar blender."
1,This thing is terrible. Not worth your money.,"Length:: 1:44 MinsI bought one of these from a local retailer and it was pretty bad to begin with, the blade is not sharpened at all, so I had to use it very carefully to avoid it getting clogged. Then after about six weeks of moderate use, making smoothies, it died. The blade is no longer connected to the motor shaft, and it won't work any more.If it had worked well before this happened, I'd have considered contacting Cuisinart for a replacement, but I don't want another one of these, so there's no point. And since I lost my receipt, I can't return it to the store I bought it from.At the end of the video I show an incredibly cheap ($10) hand blender that I got at a local discount store. I'm not recommending that one either, but in several ways, it actually appears to be better than the Cuisinart.Don't waste your money, do some research, and buy a different one than this."
1,a truly lame product,"I've owned immersion blenders for years. This one is truly a terrible product: blades are small, not sharp at all, so blending is uneven at best. Shaft doesn't detach from the motor, so there is no way to clean up the blade in a dishwasher. Motor is underpowered (100W), so coupled with dull blades, it takes forever to blend anything."
1,Old News - The internet hype is nauseating,"This book was obviously written at the peak of the internet ""Boom"". The majority of the companies cited as examples of the onslaught of the new economy are no longer in existence. Earnings are barely mentioned. Companies cited as the movers and shakers of tomorrow are now penny stocks. The total lack of balance relative to other sectors is appalling and in retrospect is by itself educational. Everyone bought into the hype including the entire VC industry. This might explain why they all sat on the sideline in 2001 trying to regain their sense of direction. The entertainment value is a 5 and the educational value a 1. It is your choice."
4,lights,this was very easy to connect had it done in under 3 min and works great would buy again if i get a new car
3,"great history-wise, long entertainment-wise","Eckert does his usual brilliant job of research, and the amplification notes in the back of the book bring the places into a modern context. However, as entertaining reading, this book takes very long to get off the ground. We miss the personalities Eckert created in his earlier books. The characters are there, but we want to know more about them as people, not just characters living on a great river in those turbulent times"
2,Disappointed,I have read several James Thom books and they are far superior to this. If you like reading history books then this one is for you.
5,Excellent Service,"Dear Amazon.com,I am very happy with this book! The delivery was on time and the book was more than I expected!Thanks again,Connie Caden"
2,Yawn.,"Is this really the same group that put out Handmade, Looking Through, and Cross-Collateral? Those top notch hyperdrive albums leap out and demand your attention. This one is unobtrusive and easily forgotten. 2 stars because it's good musicianship; alas, it's just boring."
2,EEP! Passport Have Almost Slipped!,"This is the last album recorded by a ""second"" linupof the band and it would have been far more fitting if they'd gone out in greater style then this.The albums second cut""Radiation"" is a catchy,synth-laced number and ""Ragtag And Bobtail"" is a Steely Dan at the intersection of Stanley Clarkecut the shows Dolinger's sax in high gear.Most impressive is thevocorder-whipped ""Rambling"" an electro funk-blues-soft,hard anddripping all at once.That's where this album's appeal stops.Thedull and insipid tital song,the even more blahse'""Piece For RockOrchestra"" and two additional moments of deadly dull filler makethis easily Passports most inconsistant albums.It's spilt downthe middle-four good songs and four detestable.Advice:find areasonably priced used copy of this on CD or better yet vinyl-that way in case you've never heard this it won't be too big a shock on your wallet."
5,"A primary thesis that the schism ""did not have to be""","Collaboratively compiled and co-edited by Michael G. Cartwright and Peter Ochs, The Jewish-Christian Schism Revisited is a posthumous collection of essays by John Howard Yoder (1927-1997) ""revisiting"" the Jewish-Christian split in the light of Yoder's primary thesis that the schism ""did not have to be"". The editors place Yoder's discourse within the context of dialogue with Rabbi Steven S. Schwarzschild. Examining the whole debate in light of theological understanding of what it means to be Christian, Jewish, or a ""missionary"" people, The Jewish-Christian Schism Revisited is a welcome and engaging contribution to Judeo/Christian Religious Studies collections and supplemental reading lists."
5,Interesante recurso,"Este es un curso de yuruba bien didactico y divertido, es recomendable para cualquier persona relacionado con dicha lengua, o con la cultura cubana, o religion cubana y brasileña."
5,The answers I was looking for !,"If - like me - you are interested in the title's answer, Ms.Brown's is the book! Quoting some of her words: "" Many events are completely unknown to us, many events are known only through extremely biased perspectives, and many events are so contradictorily reported that is difficult to reconstruct even a chronological sequence of what occurred"". And - believe me! - Ms. Brown interviewed people - in Taiwan ( living there) and interviewed people - in China !!! We are talking about an Stanford University Professor. Congratulations and thanks to Amazon ."
3,Great value for your money,"This is a perfect monitor for beginner computer users. It has everything you need for starters. The convenient speakers are there and the screens are adequate. If you want the best of the best monitors, you better have at $600 to spend it on. However this price is perfect. Overall, I'll give this monitor 3.5/5 stars. It's great for beginners, but for enthusiast, better go look at other monitors."
5,Top of the line,I found this monitor to be top of the line. It's very user friendly. The speakers (JBL) that came will it are outstanding.
1,Reprint of very old book,"I threw it in the garbage, it refered to african americans throughout the entire book as the N word. I realize at the time the book was written that was an acceptable practice. But it made me feel sick to see it in print, and it made me ashamed I would not want anyone to see that I owned the book. I could have resold it on ebay, but my preference was to destroy it."
3,Shallow motivations spoil this story,"Devoted priest falls (quite without a struggle) into the arms of Pamela, a woman he thinks he ""cannot live without"". It's actually kind of hard to see why, as her virtues seem shallow at best. In fact, ""shallow"" would describe her entire character. As they struggle with poverty, her main concern seems to be shame being seen with a husband foced to take a blue collar job to support her. It goes downhill from there. By three quarters of the way through the book, you are hoping she leaves him to go back home to Mumsy and Daddy so there may be a hope that her likeable but somewhat dense husband will return to the priesthood instead of throwing his life away on a vain, shallow, materialistic woman."
4,Love this BBQ!,"Finally replaced by old beat up Charboiler with the Ducane. All I can say is that I should have done it a long time ago. Cooks everything great.I've added a thermometer to the lid since I bought it just to be able to monitor the temperature. I bought a generic one at Home Depot and drilled a hole to install it.BTW, you will get flame flareup if the juices drip onto the ceramic pieces. The grates do not allow you to spray water onto the flames to extinguish them. I recommend that you just blow them out or move the food to one side of the grill and turn off the burner on that side. Other than that, works like a charm!"
3,Nice Grill but last year's model and pieces missing through damage!!!,"This is fine grill but I'm afraid that the Ace Hardware store that Amazon subcontracts to sell this item was DUMPING their old and damaged inventory.When we opened the box we noticed there was a hole at the bottom and the plastic bag holding the fasteners and such was broken and this wide assortment of hardware had exploded throughout the box. Besides this the unit itself was scored by mishandling.Ducane (Weber) is a fine company and had a customer support person available to order the many missing parts. There were so many missing by the way, that our intended ""chicken barbeque"" had to be fashioned otherwise.When I spoke with the man in customer service at Weber he took down the serial number and found that the unit I bought in Dec. 2006 was a 2005 model. Thanks alot Ace Hardware for dumping damaged and obsolete inventory on me :-("
5,Ducane 2-burner BBQ,"Arrived all in good order and went together in about 30 mins. Other than the drawings being a bit small, everything went together quite easily. Much of it was actually pre-assembled (controls, etc.) which was nice. Will fire it up this weekend!"
4,Symbols of the Christian Faith,"This book, although smaller than I expected, is PACKED, with designs and concise explanations of common and uncommon Christian symbols. The author has even included many not well known symbols, symbols unknown except to antiquity and their histories. My intent is to incorporate some of these symbols in jewelry and art of my original design. With th information and articles provided in this book, that will be easy. Well worth the money. DEFINITELY recommend this book."
3,title caught my attention,I got this for a friend who seems to be miserable all of the time. Thought this might wake him up.
1,Very dated,"Having read (many, many years ago) other work by Dan Greenberg, I was rather disappointed by this effort. Perhaps, I am more into being optimistic. Not a fun book."
5,It's huge!,"This lunchbox isn't for everyone because of it's size. But my husband loves it because he can take his lunch, snacks and water for the entire day and doesn't have to use the company refrigerator. It keeps everything nice and cold."
5,Tattoos for kids!,"This was purchased for my 5 year old last Christmas and is still making its mark today! It is easy to use and to figure out but it does hurt some of the younger kids with it's poking style. My son puts tattoos all over himself, our family and most visitors. I wish that the stencils were longer lasting (they are just stickers and we've thrown them all away) and that it had the option of a refill package for replacement markers and stencils."
3,Tattoo time!,"I bought this toy because it seemed fun since my kids love tattoos. They enjoyed it immensely but after much thought, I have realized that it's just an ordinary pen that was hyped up. It turned out to be a pretty expensive pen with expensive refills. It also takes a bit of practice to do it properly. But in the end I am happy cuz it was appreciated by my kids."
4,Fun for the whole family.,"Bought this for my nephew, wasn't the only one he got that year even. I think even grandma got a tattoo for christmas. Besides if you get two for christmas no need to worry about the ink running out."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I have the original recording of the ""Crazy Otto"" from the early fifties.I enjoyed the selections on this CD, however, understandably the artist is much older now and many of the songs are 'hurried' and the beat goes from slow to fast in a matter of time.I guess I thought in particular that the recording of the ""Crazy Otto"" would be like the original, and it contains the melodies of the different songs that were connected but the timing is somewhat different. Again, I understand that many years have gone by and the artist is much older now.Overall, I enjoyed and am happy to have purchased this as it reminds me of my early years of my life when I was a child and one of my favorite records/recordings was the ""Crazy Otto"" The artist is an excellent pianist."
1,Save Your Money,"I played it one time and threw it away. This is not traditional ""honky tonk"" as most of us understand it. The style is a kind of ""herky-jerky"", improv version of all of the old songs.---not the way they were written. It's not the Johnney Maddox that I was familiar with."
4,european or latin american?,Does anyone know if this book teaches European or Latin American Spanish?
5,The best Backstreet Boys Album,This is the same Millennium CD released in North America but with the bonus of the VCD.To have this in different packaging from the NA cd was a bonus :)If you can get your hand on this and you are a Backstreet boys fan... trust me... get it
4,Easy to Learn Java,"With all the information in the data processing area about Java, Java Script, Jave Beans and Java Server Pages. Where do you start. As someone that has been in the data processing business fro over 20 years. I found that starting with the ""Learn to Program with Java"" a great palce to start to learn the Java Programming language.The book starts with the system life cycle(SLC) which every business is using. It then explains the Java environment and finally steps through and builds and the information presented in each chapter.The project is the same from the beginning of the book to the completion at the end.I have use other books written by different authors and the books have either jump around with the concepts being taught or the chapter workshop were differnet for each chapter.I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to learn the Java programming langage."
5,"Excellent Book, Easy to Understand","I took an intro to programming course with Java at my university a few years ago. The professor was really bad (barely spoke English) and needless to say, I hardly got anything out of the class. I was feeling a little anxious about future programming classes so I picked up this book at the recommendation of a friend. I was truly impressed with it. I really liked the classlike setting in the book which made you feel like you were actually participating in a course, not just reading another programming book. The explanations are worded in everyday terms so you don't have to be a software engineer to figure out what is going on. In fact, Smiley actually goes way more in depth than most first semester Java courses, yet presents the information so well that you don't even notice how much you are learning. This is probably the best book I have seen to teach yourself Java and would recommend it to anyone."
5,Best introductory technical book I've read,"In short, if you really want to get the basics of Java, buy this book."
5,Ought to be THE introductory Java textbook!!,"Mr Smiley had done what I have only seen done by very good teachers in person. He has made a complex subject seem simple. The classroom format of the text answers almost every question that a new programmer might have. I also favor the single project approach that he has taken. I am amazed at how easy he made inheritance, interfaces, method overloading, and method over-riding seem. He also gave a wonderful introduction to Swing. Rather than getting into the super complex layout managers, he introduces the simple ones. He then shows how to use absolute positioning after detailing the drawbacks. The only thing that frustrates me is the referance to intermediate and advanced Java courses. I looked, and it seems that they have not yet been published..."
5,Very good book for Learning or Reviewing Java,"I just finished reading the entire Learn To Program With Java book by John Smiley and I have to say, this is a great book to either learn Java or review Java.I read this book primarily to review Java from taking some university courses. This book is just as good as taking a college course in Java. I was able to understand concepts provided by John Smiley's text better than my university class. So, I highly recommend this book."
5,Basic Learning,John Smiley's latest book on Learning to Program with Java is an easy to read and sound teaching device for those of us who need the fundamentals of Java. The classroom style of learning is incorporated into the text and asks the stupid and elegant questions most of us would ask in an actual classroom environment. Subjects are covered in enough detail with good examples that cement the concepts. I would buy it again.
5,Good book,"I received the book in a decent amount of time and is brand new. I am satisfied with my order.Thank you,Jon Gustafson"
1,Bad Ratings,"I used to value the reviews on Amazon until I purchased this book. If you think some of the Dummies series are not your style, well, this book speaks to you like a child. It is more like reading a work of fiction than a programming book. Sure, there are writing styles for beginners but this one goes too far. The book is written as a ""day in the life of a teacher"" and includes conversations with his students. Needless to say, I purchased this book to learn Java but left this book in the recycling of my hotel room after the first chapter and purchased another book. Very disappointed in both the book, and the high ratings it received on this site."
4,Good for newbies,"I bought the Kindle version and I agree with others that there are problems with the images and some text. I've bought several how-to books and generally they don't translate well into Kindle... I recommend buying the actual book rather than Kindle version for any how-to's.That aside, I found this book easy to go through. I am a total newbie when it comes to programming and my computer skills are above average. If your style is to jump into the code, then this book is not for you. This book is geared towards people like me who become scared, confused, then fall asleep seeing a bunch of code and fancy technical words to describe it. The classroom-like dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it makes learning java more approachable and inviting. Geeks who already have a background in programming with another language or can easily understand all the mumbo-jumbo, will find this book slow to get through, but total newbies may like the book's style."
5,Excellent book!,"I work in the IT industry (VoIP/telecom). One of the platforms I work with uses Java and I had absolutely no experience with any programming language. I was lucky to find folks on message boards who were willing to help me through some fairly sophisticated problems, but it irked me that I didn't have any Java knowledge to solve some types of issues myself. This is an excellent book for folks like me. It assumes that I have had absolutely no exposure to programming and walks you through tons of examples. I'm on chapter 8 right now and I find Java to be a practical subject to learn as well as a lot of fun. I already have a project in mind to get started on after I finish this book. A big thanks to the author who had the courage to write a book that's understandable. I look forward to his future titles!"
1,If you want to be an undergrad at an American college then it may be for you,"This book is trying to recreate a classroom atmosphere and is more suited to a novel about being a teacher.It was a real turnoff for me and was not suitable. I wanted to learn Java, not have an experience of being a student in an American education facility."
3,Kindle version,"After chapter 5, you can hardly see any complete codes if you buy a kindle version. This is terrible. But the content is great."
2,"Terrible Production, Elementary Message","This DVD is OK for very young believers. But the production is horrible (corny acting, bad camera angles, awful sound). And the points they communicate are very basic. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this. Reading The Screwtape Letters will be much more worth your time."
3,"So, So","Not bad, but not great. Would work in a Christian Education setting. Outside of the church it might not fly far."
4,A Short Guide to Writing About Biology (Short Guides Series),thank you for the fast deleviery sorry that it has taken me so long to send feed back
5,Helpful,I bought this for a college biology course. The book is very good at teaching you tips for writing scientific papers.
1,"this is the edited, radio version","the ""twisted transistor"" on this cd-single is the edited, radio version. the song is shortened from its original length, and all foul language is blanked out. it makes the song very boring and it's over too quick (it only clocks in at 3 minutes). the single also contains ""too late i'm dead"" which is a heavy, industrial-based song. nothing special. last song on the disc is ""twisted transistor (kupper's elektro-tek radio edit)"" which is a horrible techno version of the song."" I am giving this 1 star because I don't like the edited version of ""twisted transistor"" (my fault for not asking before buying it) and the two remaining songs are weak."
4,Gift for my wife,"The Le Creuset wok was a Christmas gift for my wife. She likes it, therefore I like it."
3,Good but Somehow Lacking,"Claire Calman writes with an easy and flowing style but this book somehow lacked enough twists and turns in the overall plot to keep me totally immersed in it. This is the story of a marriage turned sour due to infidelity and the effects that its breakdown has on the couple's two children. The story is told through the eyes of the four main characters, namely the two parents and the two children. This made for four totally different perspectives on the situation but, for me, the book tended to plod along at a similar pace throughout with no particular highs and lows. Its an easy read but not, in my opinion, up to the standard that I had experienced before in the author's previous novel, ""Love is a Four Letter Word""."
1,Only a sales tool,"If you're interested in buying the M6TTL, take a look at the printed material Leica provides and skip this book. What little information is provided is couched in pre-WWI terms and seems to be aimed at the reader who suffers from buyer's remorse.If you've already bought the M6, you're already aware of what a terrific camera you have. You don't need this book to tell you that again."
4,Guide to Guyanan Timber Trees,"This is not the typical modern full-color-field-guide, buth rather a more traditional guide book. In 83 entries (describing one species each, but totalling 115 spp according to the publisher) it gives per entry: a page of text (name, common name, selected references, vernacular names, botanical description, field characteristics, ecology and distribution, notes); a page with a b&w line-drawing (giving excellent details, but overall not of the stunning quality found in, say, Voorhoeve's ""Liberian high forest trees""); and in back of the book a color photograph (of very good quality, 5.7x9.1cm) each of the bark and of the slash. All in all a pretty good book, although notably the typography could be a lot better..."
1,Poor alignment,"Does anyone else see the poor alignment of this woman? Her head should be lifted, the back of the neck extended, not crunched looking up while the head lifts up and out of the shoulders as hands press into the mat.Just a thought from a teacher of yoga."
1,Don't waste your money,"This was as disappointing of a book as I've bought. I have found much better material on the internet for free. I own an English language school in Japan and this book is utterly useless. It might be of some use to you if your idea of teaching is to photocopy boring worksheets and pray that nobody notices. This book is a waste of money. There is nothing of value to any trained professional. This woman is a sham. I bought several of her books and regret each purchase. In my situation, I need to not only teach the English language, but make it interesting and fun since that is what the parents of my students are paying for. Results and children who don't hate the English language due to poor teaching. avoid Elizabeth Claire like the plague.------------------------------------------------------"
1,Boooooring,"Perhaps if you are lazy and just wish to photocopy boring activities and space out behind your desk, this book is for you. I own an English school in Japan and this was utterly useless. The activities are unimaginative and rote. The author is a sham. Avoid this lemon."
1,Two defective of Four ordered,"I purchased four of the 1700 mAh New Equivalent BP315 BP-315 batteries for my HV10 camcorder. One of the batteries would not charge at all, the other lasted <5 minutes twice after being charged for 24 hours. The other two appear to last at least for 30 minutes for camcorder recordings -- their real duration will be determined ove this next week. Obviously, bad quality control."
3,"Good history,but boring.","Mr. Schlesinger's book is good in some regards. But I have to agree with an earlier reviewer about the rambling on at the end of the book.The best aspect of the book is the history of American presidents and the process of engaging in war. An example being Truman setting the precedent of ""the president possessing the inherent power to go to war.""The author effectively explains the differences between preventive and pre-emptive war.The history of close presidential elections was used as a segue to the electoral college topic.His chapter on the electoral college was very good! He detailed the history of and changes made to the electoral college. The ""national bonus plan"" is intriguing and a possible solution to the anomoly of a candidate winning the popular vote while losing the presidency due to different results from the electoral college.This book was good on some level,but had some boring areas that left me disappointed overall."
3,a decline in creativity,"I've been Matt Bianco's fan since their first album and I have all their albums. Noticing that their music has grown (or should I say mutated) over the years, I can't say that this album is a masterpiece. The songwriting is very good, indeed. But apart from the Cuban music they played, I found nothing new about them. Similar exploration was done in their Another Time Another Place album. Also on Gran Via and World Go Round. Those albums were much better than Rico. Except for the vocals and beautiful piano by Fisher, the music is just like ordinary Cuban music. Not Matt Bianco."
5,"Matt Bianco ""RICO""","One of my favorite Matt Bianco CD.s ,. If you like Matt Bianco you will love this one. I do !!!!"
3,No Illistrations,"As a Mason of 36 years and always reading I thought I would add this to my collection. On receiving it I was dissapointed to see that all the pictorial illistrations were not included in the book, only the text! The net version does have the pictures/illistrations and would be better included in the text!"
3,The Olde Curiosity Shop,A nice family oriented film which we enjoyed. I can see the Disney effect as it has been unnaturally prettied up. It is typical Charles Dickens.
3,Loved inheritance,It was worth the bargain only because of The Inheritance! The Curiosity Shop lost me completely. I usually love Dickens...but not this one=-O
3,50 pages twice,"Most people I know who have attempted this get through about 50 pages, put it down for a year and get through the same 50 pages agiain. Get it from the library first.But it does look really good on your shelf - be sure to learn at least one quote from it to bring up in class - instant A (no one will understand it and assume you do)!"
1,...,"I've had to wade through a lot of postmodern, ""poststructuralist"" muck in my day -...- but this by far takes the cake. (The world's worst translation of _Simulacra and Simulation_ has nothing on this!) Lest you miss out on the choice narrative style, here's a synopsis:""Deleuze wants language to be encountered as communication which codes and 'over-codes' desires, which territorializes and 'deterritorializes' power, and which spreads and 'organizes' in the patterns of rhizomes. He challenges us to recognize in language an aspect where meaning and reference are less important than pattern, where we leave behind talking about the world in favor of a talk matching the world's flows and breaks and relative movements.""""Meaning and reference less important than pattern."" Does that make a lot of sense to you? Is it any wonder that contemporary philosophy is fighting not only to be considered relevant, but even for its very survival?..."
1,In Praise of Fascism.,"Fascism - it's not just for Benito Mussolini anymore.This book started the whole idea that now rather than rationally refute those who may have legitimate sources of disagreement with us, it's now okay that we just label them fascists. So: a traditionalist Catholic, an orthodox Jew, a Lakota shaman, an American scientist, a civil libertarian, a psychologist, or anyone else who disagrees with a bunch of narrowly defined BS about ""productionist metaphysics"" and Reichian pseudo-science or anything else proposed by a bunch of French a**holes is now a fascist. Anyone who would like to found a community based on traditional values or who dares to suggest such ""ultra-reactionary heresy"" as that there might be an objective truth or the commonsense notion that perhaps ""reason is indeed reasonable"" is really a fascist in disguise. Nice. Funny thing is, the opposition to fascism is starting to look an awfully lot like - yeah, fascism!"
4,"carefully crafted, soulful, stirring music","Saw Dan live in Winnipeg, travelling with Hey Rosetta! Having never heard of Dan and not expecting a second act on the card, it was a nice suprise. Talent never disappoints, Dan was a solo act but threw in with hey rosetta here and there and visa-versa... it was a grrreat show"
5,Forshadows the possibilities of what could go wrong...a good dose of skepticism is very healthy...,"The author presents various scenarios that are supported by past events. Timelines, degree and origin of crisis miss the bullseye, but not the target. The author does mention CMO's, which sound like the CDO debacle now unfolding due to subprime loans packaged within these securities.Extremely enlightening. An excellent bargain for .01 cent. It's the ultimate ""contrarian"" purchase for a personal finance book."
5,Great Hair Spray,This hair spray doesn't weigh down my hair. I only need to use it once and it keeps my hair in place.
4,Good starter book,"This book was very useful in teaching myself to make and animate 3D characters. The step-by-step direction are truely useful. The image details don't always match the the written directions and leave a bit to be desired, but it isn't really a hendrince."
4,good book to add quality to your characters,"Overall, i felt this book was good. If you are looking for a book that tells you which buttons and numbers to type to create a character, this book WONT help. This book is not specific to a type of program (the author wants to make money, not have an outdated book in a year). This can be a good and bad thing. The book does share tequniques for creating characters, but it is mostly helpful in adding real personality to your characters. It gives you tips on creating higher quality animations of your character."
1,Not worth it,"This book is ultra beginner level. I thought it would help me design and program a skeletal deformation system for meshes, it did not. I don't see how it could even help someone who just wanted to animate characters in Max. Lots of pictures, very little text. I got every thing I was going to get out of this book in the first 5 minuets."
3,"Great, but with lots of omissions.","Okay maybe I would give this book a 3.5, because of the great illustrations of everything going on, but there's a big problem with this title and the stuff that you get. The book is called Digital Character Animation 2, and the keyword there is ANIMATION, which the book lacked extremely. I might add more examples of animation, because 3 pages of beginner stuff isn't going to help a more experienced user. This book is great for beginners, and will teach you a whole ton of new stuff and open your eyes to the fabulous world of 3d. But beware professionals."
1,Worst $5 spent ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the biggest waste of money ever. If you are truly trying to gain information regarding actual Alaskan oil feild ""experience"" ie the day to day life do not waste your money on this!!"
1,???,"To Whom It May Concern:Why was I asked to review Anthologie: 1966-69? A few months ago, you asked me to write a review of a Janet Blair CD which I submitted. It never made the list of reviews. Why wasn't it listed? I've been a professional award-winning writer all of my life and I NEVER had an article rejected.I would appreciate an explanation. Otherwise, please don't clog up my email with such requests as these.Sincerely,Henry Orberg104 Bartram TrailSt. Simons Island, GA 31522(912) 634-2904[..]"
2,At least it was better than THE MANGLER.,"When I watch a slasher film I want graphic violence, blood, gore, hot naked women, lots of cussing, originality and a fast pace. Is that too much to ask for? Apparently it is cause this movie features none of the above. Actually outside of a few sprays of blood, one quick scene of drug use and a few cuss words TOOLBOX MURDERS could air on network television. I'm not exaggerating.I could explain all the things wrong with the script, but really it'd just be pointless. If you wanna watch it then watch it. Maybe you'll get a good nap out of it, but remember Tobe Hooper is the same guy who directed THE MANGLER, INVADERS FROM MARS and CROCODILE.Oh yea. All of you excited about Sheri Moon being in the movie can save yourself the trouble. She's in it for maybe 5 minutes and nothing happens."
1,What a disappointment!,"I admire that instead of just re-making the original movie, they decided to get 'creative' with the script...but, in this case, they would have been better off to have stuck with the original story as what they came up with here is ridiculous!There is not enough back story on the killer, so, we never really know who is is and why he is doing all the killing, the same with the building, we are told it is a 'spell', but, WHY was it built that way?The acting/cast if fine, but it just seems like a bunch of random scenes were clumped together and called a movie.....Definately rent, not buy, this one if you must see it just because it is a Tobe Hooper film."
4,All this death...,"Now THIS is a horror movie. If the kill scenes had been a little less ""inventive"" and gory, this movie should have been a box office hit. It's part mystery, part thriller and a lot of horror movie! How this didn't make it to the theaters but garbage like Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning did is unbelievable to me.Angela Bettis (May, Girl Interrupted) is fantastic as the clever heroine. She is smart, ballsy and has just the right dose of neurosis, without being whiny and annoying.The atmosphere of the creepy building with its weird history is great (think Dark Water w/Jennifer Connoly but better). The characters are all interesting and have purpose in the movie.There is a little bit of everything going on and it all comes together nicely. Kind of a quick wrap up ending with not much explanation, but it doensn't detract from the movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat and scared! Excellent rental! Reminescent of Pacific Heights, Sliver, and Saw."
1,Toolbox Murders(Remake of the orignal),"The ""The"" has been dropped from Toolbox Murders in this ""re-imagining"" which is a nice word for Remake or we are running out of ideas let's look to movies already Made,and so let's do ""the toolbox murders"" a so-called based on a true story slasher film(they all are) and re-imagine with more violence and gore and let's see if it passes as a Good Horror movie..Nope, It's just a dude in a hotel killing off broads with his toolbox,I've seen it And I am not impressed."
2,Glad I rented it--instead of buying!,"There's really not much to recommend about this movie-the scenes are shot too darkly-there's no atmosphere or suspense--the villain--surprise surprise--doesn't seem to quite be dead--repeatedly, (Shades of Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees!) a little gore-simply for gores sake--pretty boring movie!Most of the characters are poor stereotypes and there's really no chemistry between the two leads. Probably the most interesting character is the mother of the peeping Tom--and she had all of about 30 seconds in the movie!Perhaps an ok story--but poorly executed. I'd recommend giving this one a pass!"
4,Setting is everything...,"I loved this movie for a few reasons.First, the building and settings are in old holly-weird type and give a very chilling feel to the atmosphere.Second, the movie went slow, but not too slow; so the build-up is fantastic.Last, the actress is very believable and you get the feeling she is REALLY scared!The gore and death scenes look to be the really well done, and you'll never guess the twist. Very fun to watch, overall, I gave it 4 out of 5 because it leaves a lot of questions."
1,"I wanted it to be good, really I did","As much as any other horror fan, I'd liked to have seen Tobe Hooper come out swinging with a film that shows he still knows how it's done, but Toolbox Murders sure isn't it. You've seen the same basic premise handled much better a dozen times before (even in hogwash like The Sentinel) and Hooper does nothing new with it. He also never generates any real suspense in Toolbox, the gore murders are silly and pointless, and the acting is wildly uneven. It's too bad because there are a couple ideas here that you can imagine (or have already seen) put to effective use, but Hooper just doesn't make it work."
2,Gory,"Hooper did a great movie with Texas Chainsaw, but this movie is poor. It's gory without the logic, and that doesnt make a fulfilling movie."
1,CAN'T BEAT THE ORIGINAL!!,"If your a fan of the original you might want to steer clear of the steaming lump of....uh...you know. High gloss Hollywood horror,(thats not a good thing), couple of bloody scenes done very well, but not enough too satisfy, want to see this? RENT IT! That way when your sitting there saying ""WOW, this is boring!"" you'll only be out a couple of bucks rather than $20+ (sorry Tobe)"
2,"Good for gore, nothing else.","The original ""Toolbox Murders"" in my opinion was a cult-classic from the 70's. This is a remake which decides to go it's own direction, and just falls apart like severly water-damaged drywall(pun, by the way). The DVD does have some interesting extras: 2 commentaries and handful of deleted scenes, which, amazingly, are better than the film. See for yourself. Rent first, then consider buying if you're into this kinda thing. However, if you're a fan of the original, it comes NO WHERE CLOSE in my opinion. See for yourself. Long live Cameron Mitchell!"
3,It was different,"When I saw the preveiws, I wanted to see this so bad. It turned out to be reaaly good. I can't give it 4 because it wasn't one of my favorites. but its worth it to give it a shot."
3,Better than you'd expect...,"Most people who rent or buy this, I'm sure do so because it was directed by Tobe Hooper. Now, this is nowhere near as good as Texas Chainsaw or his older stuff, but it is far better than most of the terrible horror films that are getting released in America these days, such as Saw and Cabin Fever. The actual remake part of the story, i.e. people getting hacked to death in an apartment building, is by the numbers; however, the surrounding mysteries of the building's history and the links the architect had to the occult, are very intriguing and build a good amount of creepiness and suspense. Definently worth renting, probably not worth buying."
1,Horrible in every way imaginable except . . .,"in the way you'd like. The acting is strictly late-night Cinemax with the possible exception of Angela Bettis. Not that she was given much to work with . . . but against a background of cardboard characters and wooden performances she stands out.Still love her from May.The script is terrible - obviously, or the ""actors"" would've had a chance. As it is there is nothing worthwhile in this hackneyed story. You're nightmaring already if you think the baddie is gonna give you a scare, a creep or even some mild revulsion at some gore. (You'd have better luck in one of those rapidly assembled ""haunted houses"" come Halloween.) There's nothing here worth the price of admission. I was sorry to have wasted time on this flick after catching it on cable.Pass. Or believe these phoney reviewers."
5,Loved It!,"Bought this movie as a gift, they loved it (as they had lost their copy and couldn't find it anywhere). Super-fast shipping, good price, like brand new."
5,Tobe is not trying to make another TCM here.,"For those who are wanting another TCM, forget it. Tobe has moved on.This one stands alone as a great, gory, entertaining fright-fest. Loved seeing Angela Bettis doing a less eccentric role - this girl is fast becoming one of my favourite horror stars. She shines in the lead role.As ambiguous as the killer is, I found the whole unknown factor quite fascinating here. Creepy damn building with some great kills and scares. For fans of horror only, PG-13 ""horror"" fans won't find much to like here.Enjoy!"
4,Suspenseful and fun to watch!,"I thought Tobe Hooper and the gang did a great job with The Toolbox Murders. I felt that the movie built up the suspense to a great climax. The plot is the tried-and-true ""people stuck in a place with a deranged killer."" The acting really wasn't that bad for a horror movie. The settings and the cinematography really made you feel like you were in the apartment building. The special effects are pretty cool. And the killer is nothing less than you'd expect from Hooper. I think this movie is a fun film that you can get a few scares from and that most people will enjoy it."
1,Didn't work...,"This did not work well at all! This does work for a few hours, but for someone like me who sweats and stinks a lot, it did not make me not smell bad. I was looking for something that would work great all day that didn't have any aluminum in it and was all natural, this didn't work, but fit the other two criteria. I would not recomend this if you have a stinking problem, only if you are a light sweater in the first place would this likely work for you."
4,A high quality wrist brace,"The workmanship of this wrist brace seems to be top notch--reasonable padding everywhere and the stitching seems well done and not likely to come apart soon. It's larger, heavier and more substantial than the wrist braces you'll find in the drug store.The only issue I had was that the tip of the metal flange dug into my palm a bit, which I noticed because I often wear the brace when *not* bowling to prevent strain. I easily fixed the problem with two pairs of pliers, by bending the tip of the metal flange back a bit so that the end was curved back away from the palm.Recommended!"
5,This video is amazing!,This video was perfect for me. I didnt know anything about making knifes. This DVD was easy to follow and fun to watch. Knifemaking takes a lot of work but Tim and Marian made it look so simple. I would recommend this video to anyone that is on a budget and wants to start making knifes. They really know how to stretch their resources. Thank you for making such a helpful DVD!
4,very informative,you can read a lot of books on the subject but it sure helps to see a video..... great demo
5,I loved this video so much I asked my local library to get a copy,"The video is worth every penny. I asked my local library to get a copy. Even if you don't make a knife, the information is still nice to know."
4,"excellent content, only a slight glitch on the DVD","Excellent tutorials! This DVD shows you how to blacksmith a knife from start to finish. It stays low tech... showing you how to make charcoal and your own forge. The authors work with a tradition anvil (another money saver).The only minus is that the DVD doesn't play in some players. It's a mastering issue I imagine and, to be fair, I haven't contacted the authors to find out if that's a standard problem or a glitch on just my copy.worth buying!"
4,hole in case,Product came on time and worked fine. Only problem was that it came with a hole in the Dvd case. Like someone stabbed it with a screwdriver or something. Didn't affect performance. Overall good product
5,Snoopy Rocks,"I got this for my 3 year old grand daughter she loves Snoopy. She has had a ball with this dvd she loves the songs and the dancing, she dances with Snoopy. This has been well worth the money. She watches it at least once a day if not more. She took it on a trip with her Mom and Pawpaw and played it all the way there and back lol they all know the songs by heart now.Kathy"
3,a big snoopy fan!,"If you love snoopy and grew up watching Charlie Brown, then you'll love this dear-to-heart and fun movie about Snoopy's puppy days."
2,Snoopy is better appreciated in small doses,"Personally, I prefer Linus, but I'm sure Snoopy is arguably the most popular Peanuts character outside of Charlie Brown. But like a lot of great supporting stars, Snoopy is best appreciated in small doses. So this DVD, with Snoopy enjoying a family reunion is definitely minor league Peanuts. Even less entertaining is the dated spoof of Flashdance with Snoopy as Flashbeagle."
3,bonus feature better than title feature,"This was an ok film it was nice to see Snoopies siblings but it's story was more than a little weak and aurgued with some of the points in Snoopy come home which said Charlie Brown Got Snoopy as a small child as a gifty from his folks. This said he bought him Knowing he was preowned. As long as you don't care about consistency of story and just wanna see Snoopy and his family you'll enjoy it.Now Flashbeagle I remember from childhood and loved it involved the whole gang, it was funny with Good music. I really enjoyed seeing that again. I hope they'll make more collections and put it on one of those."
3,Too Clever By Half,"This is a dificult book to like, primarily because the principal characters are so distinctly unlovable. Also, the book is dependent upon a gimmick which really doesn't quite come off. It is quite possible to suspend one's disbelief to accept the author's contention that the subject of the book is a great and innovative artist only if one is not presented with his art; alas, we are so presented and it doesn't convince. I was gravely disappointed in the book and the illustrations were insufficiently deft to convey the author's intention."
5,One sitting Profound Read,"Nissenson has written a passionate work that reminds me of great epic poems. Art, literature, imagination, and a profound interest in our deepest philosophical concerns illuminates this unbelievably interesting and valuable novel.Do yourself a big favor and give Nissenson a few hours of your time."
2,disappointed,Overall sound adequate but sound was disappointing. Although several older stars performed many of the songs performed by the non recording artist were very poor.
1,Don't buy this...,"Purchased this alternator based on the good price, which was a terrible idea. Ran into problems getting the alternator to fit correctly, then after installation the battery light remains on. Faulty equipment. I recommend bosche. Terribly unhappy."
2,absolutely awful,This book got a lot of good reviews (could be her friends?). I tried a couple of recipes and they all sucked. This book is dusty now and I am definetly sorry I spent the money. Moosewood is so much better for veggieheads.
1,Fast Cooking in a Slow Cooker Every Day of the Year: A Slow Cooker Vegetarian Cookbook,Nothing new here...
3,Weird complicated recipes,"The author clearly seems to know her stuff and has complete information on cooking times for all of the types of crockpots out there.But, I found the recipes weird, hard to use, or uninspiring.She recommends food release spray or lecitin for nearly every recipe to make clean up easy.I'm reluctant to add this stuff. I don't know if all books recommend this step.You either need to add an ingredient 30 minutes before the food is done, or blend something, or put something in another dish and put that in the crockpot (mine is too small for that)I just want to throw some food in a pot and find a dinner ready when I get back from work.Pretty much the only recipes that would work that way are the bean dishes. (and even then, you really should pre-soak the beans) I can't really find anything I want to cook in here and will look for another book"
1,not practical,"I am a busy working vegetarian mother, and was looking for some easy crockpot recipes for my family. This book was complicated and not what i was looking for."
1,Would give it zero stars if I could,I will never buy another Dr. Scholl's pedicure product. I bought this and the callus remover. They were both completely worthless. I wrote the company that I was not happy with the products but they didn't even respond.
4,Outlaw Golf PC - Windows 7 Compatible!,"Before this I had only played Outlaw Golf 2 on PS2. Since I found out that it was not backward compatible with my new PS3 (after buying OG2!), I found this was my only alternative. It looks and plays much the same as the second version. I have not yet tried to map my PS3 controller to the game controls, so I don't know if that will work yet. Good news though, it runs under Windows 7 (Ultimate) with no issues whatsoever, even installed to a non-default folder! That was my biggest worry when I purchased this ($12 gamble)."
3,Shroud gives evidence that Jesus survived the crucifixion,"Too much blood for a corpse, no signs for rigor, body-heat was the energy that caused the forming of the image and so on. The evidence is clear - no miracle needed. See www.shroud.info"
2,Not true replacement bracket,"This bracket is not an exact replacement. The bracket suspenses the closet bar 1/4 inch lower than the originals so the bar appears to be bowed. I did not end up using these brackets and found other replacements. However, the quality of the bracket is good and seems more substantial than the original."
4,Great Item,"Great item. This item should be the one sent with the original hangers that seem to have a breaking problem. Quick shipping by seller, too."
4,Love these critters !,"I keep these critters on my desk. They make great stress relievers. I also use them when I facilitate group discussions in high school classes. Students can't talk unless ""they're holding the pig"". When they get dirty, I simply wash them in soapy water and once they dry to that sticky stage, I use baby powder on them to help restore them to their original non-sticky puffability !"
4,definitely good little gem here,"ok so zoot woman rules. they are kind of like electro hall and oats. it's VERY 80s, and has a kind of soft-rock feel to it, but in the best possible way. hell, they even cover kraftwerk's ""the model"" and make it sound kind of like mister mister or something. i don't know what i'm talking about, just buy it."
1,"Looks nice, plays horribly","I got this for my one year old son who LOVES drumming on anything and everything. They look really nice, but they produce absolutely no sound! At least not the sound you'd expect from a set of bongo drums. We're returning to get something better; these definitely aren't worth it."
5,Smaller then expected,Other then being smaller then elected they will be perfect for a 4 year old who loves and lives for music
3,Bongos away,"The product has great sound quality and can produce a few different notes on each drum, i definately recommend it."
2,Keiser's St Mark Passion,"This recording is the only one I have found on this wonderful piece. I give it two stars just because Keiser's music is so wonderful and makes the recording worth listening to. However, the ensemble are not playing good, nor is the soloists good. They have a female alto for the solo parts, which includes several male roles such as Judas, High Priest etc. This makes it sound rather funny. The choice of tempi is bad and the overall interpretation of the piece is unfortunately very weak. Buy this recording just because there isn't any other; but be prepared on a bad performance."
2,"The recipes are gluten free, but healthy it's not!","I read all the reviews before I bought this book and assumed it was a good book for people allergic to gluten looking for 'healthy' recipes. If you consider brown sugar, confectioner's sugar, white sugar, corn syrup, margarine, Butter Flavored Crisco, canned vegetables, and soda 'healthy' ingredients then by all means this book is for you. But, if you're like me and have health problems then I would suggest not buying this book. You'd be better off buying prepared gluten free flour and adapting recipes you already have.Many of the meat and vegetable recipes are just wasting space in the book. How hard is it to prepare poached salmon, three bean salad, or cole slaw without gluten?I am returning the book to Amazon because I cannot use it."
5,A necessity for the gluten-free kitchen,"The bean-flour bread recipes alone make this book a worthwhile buy. No more dry, crumbly, grainy rice breads for me! Finally, individuals on a gf diet can have a bread with a texture just like wheat bread. Directions both for bread machines and for mixing by hand are included. Thanks to Bette, my gluten-free, dairy-free son will eat sandwiches again! This book also provides tips that are helpful for adapting recipes on your own, including descriptions of different flours and substitution recommendations. Plus, there is a wide variety of easy dinner recipes."
5,delicious allergy free recipes!,"These recipes really are delicious! My favorite so far is the bean flour pasta that rivals handmade pasta I've had in Tuscany.In the six months since being diagnosed with multiple food allergies, including wheat and cows milk, everything I've tried from a mix or store bought has been less than good. Other allergy-free cookbooks I purchased on Amazon actually consider a plain baked potato a recipe.This book is an amazing resource for stocking your wheat-free pantry. Another bonus is the advice and tips within recipes on how to substitute for additional allergies you may have such as milk and egg.I'm buying copies for fiends and family so that they will again be able to make meals that I can eat."
3,Not one of Bette's best...,"I got this book as a birthday gift after going crazy for her Comfort Food book... I don't care for her reliance on V-8 juice, and some recipes seem to be more of a hassle to cut corners than to just make the recipe from scratch! Wasn't impressed with the health factor (it's not a concern for me, but if you're looking for that, it's not here) despite a different slew of recipes.Currently the book sits more than it's used, and I take it out for the occasional reference or starting point to make my own dish.. Buy her other books before you buy this one."
5,Glee is fun for a musical comedy and drama,"I hate and despise musicals. My favorite is Moulin Rouge with Nicole Kidman. otherwise, I am NOT a fan of CHICAGO etc... I wasn't sure what to make of GLEE before I saw the first episode. I read how it dealt with social issues etc... online.Hooked from episode one based on their rendition of Journey's ""don't stop believing."" Their version was just as intense as Journey's original version. The characters all added something to high school as I remembered in 1987-1991.Except there is more tolerance in this show than I ever remembered in my 4 years of high school. The writers put a lot of thought into serious matter such as gay student being harassed by jocks, down syndrome girl being accepted into cheerleading, popular cheerleader ends up with baby etc....Very pleasureable to watch! Can't wait for season 2 to come out (on dvd)!!!"
5,I love being a Gleek!,"Fast shipping, and wonderful service. I loved the DVD and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wanted to buy it!"
2,glee-less,love this series and i also bought glee the complete series season 1. i wish that i would have known the glee the complete series volume 2 road to the regionals was already inclueded in the complete series season 1 so i wouldnt have bought the same dvd twice.
4,GLEE is great!,The show GLEE has taken the television world by storm. This group of misfits include somebody that everyone can identify with and that's what makes the show wonderful. The songs are good and the presentations of them are very good with some different renditions of classical songs.
4,Ok extras?,"Ok I will be brief, but why no extras or bonus features like volume 1. Or for that matter Season 1 in full has a lot of features, but volume 2 has nothing it seems. WHY?"
4,GLEEK,"If your a Gleek, you will love it. I brought the complete firstt season after I brought this and these were included. If you buy that you won't need this one."
4,Glee dvd,This item was cheaper than anywhere I could find it locally. Very pleased with quality and promptness of order.
5,Still one of the best,My son wanted this item since he loves the TV show. He already had Volume I so I got this one. He watched it straight thru and I have now ordered Season II for him. Great dvd.
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"If you're looking for a light-hearted manga book, 50 Rules is perfect! It's not very deep or meaningful and there isn't much of a plot, but it's very entertaining. It's the sort of manga you can read more than once!"
4,good deal,"my husband loves this product, it helps withhis bumps and smells great, great price to rather then 50 each from the store"
1,Not Worth It,"I have tried many shaving creams to avoid razor burn, and for the money, this is the worst I have tried. I get a better shave from average shave gel. This product is not worth the money at all."
3,Learning to cook gluten free,Several boxes arrive with broken noodles but we used them anyway. This lasagne taste almost like a wheat lasagne however it doesn't take as long to boil as regular lasagne. Next time I will try it dry instead of boiling it first. The only drawback is that it gets mushy making leftover only good for a day.
4,WARNING!!,"The box of pasta we received (actually, it was one box with 5 boxes of lasanga) had mostly shattered pasta in it! (the penne we ordered was fine, maybe lasagna is just too fragile to travel by mail!), and Amazon graciously and quickly refunded my money. I'm hoping we can salvage enough intact sheets to make one meal...gave 4 stars without trying it. I will keep looking for a store that carries gf lasagna noodles, haven't found it yet..."
1,Not the best gluten-free pasta you can buy,This pasta overcooks way to easy. If you're not careful you'll end up with a pile of mush that you can't do anything with. My recommendation is to stay away from this brand and try another one.I've switched to Tinkyada brand pasta because it doesn't turn to mush. You cook it like regular pasta and you wouldn't know it wasn't regular pasta.
5,Samsung charger works great!,"Product was shipped quickly and works better than the one that it replaces.Thanks,S"
4,Good,"Some of the words have miss spell, i dont like at all the product because the quality for the price i pay, is like the Pirate version of the book. Sorry!"
5,"Humana, tierna, real, cruel... en una palabra: tordopeniosa.","Lo que mas me gusta de Rayuela es que existen mM-zltiples caminos para su entendimiento, todos correctos, y que desembocan a distintos fines, situaciones, personajes, sentimientos, conclusiones y desazones, todas correctas, y que todas se efimulcan en una itupalia de tarminoza, en vircaminosis de platrM-sn y de camotM-slises tan ornoperifolios como la mismM-msima tratarinia. ""Agur"".es"
1,unreadable error ridden kindle fiasco,"Cortazar's masterpiece is only insulted by this sloppy, unreadable mess. I am seeking a refund for this apalling excuse for an ebook."
5,Fast and entertaining,"A book taht cuts right to the heart of the matter. Without a wasted word the author takes you along with his characters as they romp and ramble along the bumpy roads of rural Washington state. Every word kept me begging for more. Strung along with great description, the author awoke in me a real desire to get out and see the world."
5,EXCELLENT dictionary - its size belies its content,"This is an excellent pocket dictionary. It is incredibly thorough, including useful words and not limited to simple vocabulary. It is the perfect size as well, fitting within a pocket or fanny pack with ease. It includes pronunciation rules for both English and Portuguese as well as numbers. I have never been disappointed with it and would highly recommend it and other Berlitz dictionaries."
2,Portuguese dictionary for 20/20 readers,I need this dictionary and it will be useful. But the print is too small for me. I wish the size had been part of the description with a sample to look at.
4,Original!,"Gilbert, amuses us with his wit, humor and great detail of every day life. Each story has a completely new and fresh tale, leaving you at the end,...WANTING MORE!"
2,Not to my taste,"I love short stories and read collections almost to the exclusion of novels. But this collection left me cold. It is a perfect example of the new school of ""cleverness."" Every line is self consciously smart, and yet when you put the sentences together, what do they add up to: not much really. Yet people will drool over the demonstration of intellect. How about some actual feeling?"
2,Just not very good,"After reading Gilbert's collection of short stories, I was left feeling empty. After seeing how others had reviewed ""Remote Feed,"" I was looking forward to cleverness, shock and intrigue, but was left struggling to get through it. If you're looking for people who write shock well, Denis Johnson and David Sedaris leave Gilbert in the dust."
2,"lots better, but works for downtown","I took five maps with me on a two-week trip to athens. This one rated 5th. If one is only going to be in the Plaka area, this one is OK. Lonely Planet Guide for Athens is superb. The map much less so. It is laminated so durability helped. detail not so great. some metro stations erroneously marked. useful streets not marked. Better than nothing, but there are better. Perhaps a new edition will improve (my copy was dated 2002 - sadly out of date.)"
4,Cute attachment to phones & stuff,I bought this as a present for my nephew & niece's birthday party. They wanted something to go into party bags for their guests & this one fit the bill. The party bag recipients found them cute & useful.
5,FUNNY ****,"Why can't the U.S. boob tube companies produce sit-coms this funny? Maybe I'm crazy but ""Trailer Park Boys"" has to have been the funniest TV I have EVER watched!!!!"
5,"Excellent, accessible social history of the High Middle Ages","The Gies excell in taking good research by historians and presenting it in a very accessible and straigforward manner. Their trilogy, which consists of Life in a Medieval City, Life in a Medieval Village, and Life in a Medieval Castle, manage to neatly distill many important themes and concepts in a lively, easy-to-digest format that is perfect for Honors middle school or regular high school students. The authors do much to dispell the myths about the Middle Ages and to present the times in all their color and variety.Life in a Medieval City focuses upon one particular French town but can be generalized, to a greater or lesser extent, to many places in northern Europe. It deals with the economic and social realities of the times with excellent clarity. Not to be missed."
3,Life In A Medieval City,"An enjoyable read, and helps to depict life during those ages. It reminded me of my own history professors from university, who whould always attempt to make history alive."
4,An interesting overview!,"Well written, with interesting factual detail. French, but has great relevance to British readers, with some British detail. An enjoyable read."
5,Waited a long time for this.,"Hammer Studios is known as ""The studio that dripped blood"". This film is, in my opinion, one of their better productions. Seeing this film restored to Blu Ray quality is like seeing it for the first time. Every copy I have had was dark and very rough. This film is a pleasure to own and great halloween material. You have witch burning, killing mobs, vampires and the first twins to appear in playboy as the stars. What more could you want. Peter Cushing gives one of his great performances as the leader of the witch burning mob. It is the third and best film of the Karnstein Trilogy from Hammer. The first film was ""Vampire Lovers"" which is available on blu ray from australia and ""Lust for a Vampire"" which was so bad it may never see a blu ray. This was worth the wait."
3,Never expected this one in blu-ray,As far as I know this film has never been released in the U.S. which I thought a shame since it is a really good vampire film. So nice to have it on blu-ray and looking great.
3,Blinded by Fear,"Not one of Hammer's best, but just okay for me. There were some pretty good actor's in this movie. Peter Cushing, one of the greatest horror actor's ever, was splendid as always. Though he felt he was doing right by killing so-called witches, he was actually a murderer. These girls were all innocent. There was an evil in town, but not any witches. The evil was more sinister, and powerful. Sometimes, one has to look in their own house to find a bigger threat.Sometimes the movie became a little boring for me, and funny. Some scenes were a little drawn out for me. All and all, it was okay. I am glad I watched it on Youtube before buying."
4,Twins of Evil (blue Ray),I have always liked this movie (and the trilogy) and had been waiting for quite awhile for it to come out on DVD. Was very pleased with the picture quality (on blue ray) but extremely disappointed in that it was only 2.1 in sound. One would think that with the DVD being put on blue ray that the sound quality would match the picture quality. It's too bad.
4,One of the Best Hammer films in the 70's,"I rate this film up there with ""Blood From the Mummy's Tomb. The reason I gave it the four stars is the ""Brotherhood"" was too comical. They probably borrowed the ""pilgrim"" costumes from ""Cromwell"" (1970). I would have replaced them with dirty peasant outfits and black hoods. Cushing would have been fine without the hat."
2,This is the Butchered version,"""Twins of Evil"" was a great movie, I remember watching it on televison as a kid. One thing that made it great was the beav shot when she attacks him. In this version they cut out that half peak of bush. I find the butchering of this film unacceptable: they showed the bush shot on regular tv in the 70's and 80's, it was only a few frames of video, why clean it up now?"
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this to try as an energy supplement because I do not respond well to caffine or energy drinks, but honestly it didn't really help. I didn't feel much different and I just forgot to take it one day and almost felt better, so I haven't taken it since.Also, after about 4 days of using 8 drops a day, I had this really horrible time getting it out of the container. I can shake it around and hear that there is more than 70% left in the bottle but I have to strain my hands squeezing it to get one drop out, what a horrible design! I don't know what to do with it, like if I want to cut the bottle open and use the rest of it or just through it away, I'm just wishing I could get my money back."
2,"Not for me. But, I'm sure it's for someone.","It did give me an energy boost. But, I was drinking coffee and then tried to take this stuff as directed. I got too hyper and even some heart palpultations. Everyone's different. So, maybe it's good for someone else. I'm returning this item."
5,Kills internal bacteria on contact,I use 6-8 drops in water w/non-aluminum bicarbonate soda as a remedy to alkalanize my blood and kill bad bacteria. Good product.
5,This is a very different book.,I think that this would be a resource that every IT Manager should read. This books goes way beyond telling you how it works. It addresses the issues of what happens when it fails. This makes it very different from any other book on Linux out there! About time.
3,"Not outstanding, but ok.","For starters: the title is a bit misleading, it should contain the words 'Unification Grammar', because that is the only theory covered in this book. People who aren't familiar with linguistics might think this is THE syntactic theory, but in fact there are many (some of which are much more credible than Unification Grammar). But apart from the fact that UG is not my cup of tea, the book is ok. Not outstanding, but ok. It more or less covers the basics of UG in an easy-to-learn-way. The many feature structures are a big help too, even though the authors do make several crucial faults in some of them! Anyway, the book did for me what it was supposed to do, which was understanding the basics of UG, so I'll rate it 3 out of five."
2,hummingbird feeder,I only gave them 2 stars because the feeder arrived quickly but it had scratches on the heart and when I went to put it together the suction cup that sticks to the window was missing!I wasn't going to ship it back because of a few scratches but was really suprised it had them because it was in it's original box and I did order a new one NOT a used one.
2,A disappointment. Nothing much new in this book.,"I really wanted to like this book but I found it to be uninspiring. I like Joan Rivers but feel this was just a book to write about what most older people already know such as 'older women shouldn't wear short skirts', etc. and her put down of retirement communities was inappropriate. There's more fun going on in some of those 'young retiree' communities than you could imagine!"
3,wold talk- learn hungarian: intermediate level,"this level is will benefit you if you have a good understanding of the language, more than just the basics. Ii is too advanced for the novice>"
3,Not bad for an early street race game.,"I played through this whole game and found it pretty fun for it's age. I was able to beat it in a few hours. It has a neat upgrade system and class system. You can keep the same car throughout the entire game and with the way you upgrade and when the game lets you, you car can become a monster. It starts out doing drags in the 22 sec. et's. Worth a look."
3,Steamy Tale,"""Bliss River"" was the first book that I had read by Thea Devine while the book did live up to its Erotic genre, the Characters were did not impress me very much. They book seem a little shallow to me. But if you are a fan of either Ms. Devine or of the Erotic genre you will more than likely enjoy this book."
3,"An Okay Read, But Not One Of The Better Ones In This Genre","I must admit to the fact that I did not care for either main character so I had a hard time in liking the story or the idea benind it. I must admit to not having read any other stories by this author so I have not much to judge on what is considered good or bad and her work.The story is set in Africa in a colony that is set up for the explicit joy and need for sex. With murder, a flight across the desert with the bad guy close behind, Charles and Georgie indulge themselves with each other. I feel that the main storyline suffers and as a result it is hard to understand where the storyline is going and where the sex is important to the story. I realize that this is an erotic story but I have read other stories of this nature by other authors and the storylines have not suffered. Sex for the sake of sex is not a story."
2,Silly and Dull,"I agree with the reviewer who said this is another in the trend of Man who Hates Woman but Has Sex with her Anyway. These two had nothing in common, indeed, rather hated each other, and I hated both of them. There was nothing that would categorize this as a ""historical"" romance--the few details of setting she gave us might as well have indicated the year 2004, though she mentioned a lorry which is a word not coined till 1900. Oh, and I also don't categorize these types of books as ""romances"" when the H&H; can barely abide each other. I like there to be affection and, god forbid, LOVE!I also didn't know there were Bedouins in South Africa. And...Aren't Charles and Georgiana COUSINS?? This book just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
2,Don't bother,I read most of all of her books and this was the last to date. This was actually kind of gross and nasty at times. I did not like the heroine. I didn't care for the storyline either. Found myself kind of disgusted with the love scenes. Most of her others were much better than this.
3,Difficult to operate,I needed an inexpensive stopwatch to keep track of games. This is not it. Too many settings. To easy to set off other functions accidently.
2,Stopwatch; drifts,I bought 2 of these to use for start contols at performance auto road rallys (races). Short term they are OK but over the course of a day or 2 the time will drift.Probably OK for a short haul stopwatch though.JimB
3,"Great information, but...","I'm currently reading this book to get information on an upcoming trip, and I'm finding it full of well written historical and geological information on the various national parks. However, the author is very anti-commercialism, and makes snarky comments throughout the book relating to that. I find this odd in a family oriented book, since balanced vacations with children often involve nature experiences, as well as enjoyable times at a commercial venue, such as a water park or mini-golf. He also tends to be merely critical towards crowds in the natural areas, rather than give you tips on how to avoid them, or ways to enjoy the area in spite of the crowds. Overall, I recommend the book based on the quality of the background information on the parks, but for practical tips on planning my trip, I plan to look elsewhere."
1,I can cook with my LG refrigerator!,We bought this thing and it worked and looked pretty good for a few years. One day I came home from work and the light inside had melted and my food was ruined.I Googled LG and fire and was amazed at how many others were having this problem. LG only offered to replace parts and I let them do that because at this time I cannot afford to replace this thing. I am scared to have it in my house! As soon as I pay off one bill I am buying a good fridge. I cannot even donate this firebox to a charity or a friend because it could kill them. BTW this fridge is also sold as a Kenmore at Sears!
1,LG FL Keys service,"Caution don't purchase LG appliances if you live in the Keys. I had the icemaker in my LG fridge go out a month ago. Begged for service which was scheduled 2 weeks ago to happen today.Long story short, I was given a window of 8 to 5, called three times during the day to try to find out about when thew tech would show up. Last call by me at 4, and was told that they had triedto reach me at my home number to reschedule. Absolute lie. I sat by my phone all day. The number they had for me was correct, they just lied about trying to contact me. I'mrescheduled for next week as they only visit my area once a week. Had I not called, I never would have known. Bottom line, a month later no service even after having purchased the extended three yearwarranty. Make sure you ask if LG has service set up in your area before considering purchasing from them.Sincerely,A wasted day in the life."
1,worst refrigerator ever... LFX21960ST,"we have had problems with the ice maker 3 times, had to turn door alarm completely because it would not stop even though no doors were open, 3 drawers have had to be replaced because of cheap plastic. Now we have a hole on the water line in the back of the refrigerator (all of a sudden... a pin size hole splashing our floor... after 4 years of working fine... that part)... it is the worst refrigerator I have ever owned... and I have moved a lot... NEVER BUY LG... it is JUNK!"
5,Pashmina Shawl,I gave one of these shawls to each of my six Granddaughters for Christmas and they love them. Each received a different color and they share back and forth.The product is excellent and the order was received promptly and undamaged.
2,"Poor quality, coarse texture",I am surprised so many liked this product. This the worst quality cashmere product I've ever touched. It itches the skin. The original retail price is set to be extremely high and is misleading. Not worth the money.
4,"Good, would probably buy again","I apparently didn't read the description carefully enough because I was surprised at how thin the shawl was when it arrived. The color (I ordered dark charcoal grey)was darker than the picture (the scarf was like a navy black color, but still a nice color and argueably as described). It took awhile to receive it but I can't say that's the seller's fault since the mail is unpredictable at my location. All in all, a decent scarf, haven't worn it yet but at this point I would probably order more from this seller."
5,Terrific product,"I ordered 3 black ones for my sister, my sister-in-law and myself. First you open the package and the smell is just like my cedar chest...in a good way. They are packaged nicely with tags saying they are %100 cashmere wool. They are very warm, (I wore it on THanksgiving in Michigan.) and the more you wear it the softer it gets. I really want another one now."
3,bookstacker,"Timley arrival. Beautiful color, it itches. I was disappointed. I will give it away to someone else. I will not buy another. I will caution others that it itches me. I have not been allergic to cashmere or silk in the past. I wanted to wear it on my trip to Europe."
3,More of a large scarf than a shawl,"I bought myself a pashmina shawl because I LOVE cashmere. The price was too good to resist.....but as the old saying goes 'you get what you pay for'. The color is great, but the fabric was rather thin. I don't regret the purchase, but it is not as substantial as I would have preferred. It makes a really nice scarf to wear with my coat though."
4,Pretty pleased,"Overall, I am pleased with this product. The color is very nice and exactly what I expected. (I picked the blue/grey color). It is soft and cozy feeling. I also received it pretty quickly.However, it is VERY thin and seems to have a loose weave. When I first opened it, the label did not look like it was very well attached, so I pulled on it (very) slightly to check. Well, a little hole immediately appeared under the corner of the label! I was mostly able to fix it, but it is still noticeable. This is obviously my fault for messing with it, but I had no idea how fragile it is (even after reading the other reviews). I worry that it will be easily snagged/ripped.Admittedly, this is my first experience buying this product, so perhaps I just am not savvy about what to expect. I would not tell people not to buy this product, but be aware that you should be kind of careful with it."
4,Not bad for the price,"I orderd two and gave one as a gift. I did not get a great first impression from this shawl. This does not have a silky texture it's more a merino wool feel. It's not bad or unpleasant but it is something to be aware of. Also the shawl had a very chemical smell right out of the package but I just fluffed it in the clothes dryer for a few minutes and it was fine. I do love the monster size and warmth of this thing but I wonder what it will feel like in the summer when I wear it with warm weather clothes. It's great right now over long sleeved tops during this cold Minnesota winter. So, even though I would have to consider this kind of a knock off pashmina I may order again because all in all, I do like it and you can't beat the price."
4,Pashmina shawl,I love the pashimina shawl ( 2) I purchased from CPG. The large shawl wasmuch larger than I expected. I am a tall woman. It was a great shawl for the price. Not as soft as a 200.00 shawl of course but a great value and very warm. I plan to purchase more for myself and for gifts. Shipping was fast and when my shawl was not immediately available I was called to see if I could wait 1 week.T. White
4,A soldier telling it like it was.,"General Crook minces no words in his autobiography, a book that gives you real insight into one of the nation's most renowned Indian fighters. A quiet man in real life and somewhat of an enigma to those around him, he had a unique understanding and appreciation for Native Americans and the injustices heaped upon them. In later life, he attempted to use his influence to help better their conditions. Crook never took his biography to a publisher -- that only happened long after he was dead. If anything, his narrative leaves you wanting more detail and less modesty about the role he played in history. The editor has done an admirable job in filling in the missing pieces. An important book for anybody interested in the people who built the West, or in influential military leaders in American history. I enjoyed this book immensely."
5,captivating and magical,"This album is one that brings me to distant, long ago yet ageless lands, among a people who live in magic and the mystery of life. The male singer has a rich, deep beautiful voice and the female singer's voice is beautiful also and perfectly matched with the music. The music itself a superb mixture of medeival music (including some chant) with a modern touch. The drum piece is incredible. The album is sung in french, but for me, not being able to understand the words just enables me to focus all the more on the music. Historically intriguing, also!"
5,Lots of fun.,Even better than the first one. I laughed myself silly. My wife thought I was having a fit.
2,Big hype for nothing,"Well in my opinion, the worst part was the pouch to mix in water; it tasted so horrible. The positive to this detox was that it go me to drink more water then I normally do in a day."
2,Not her best,"This is the seventh book I've read in Asaro's Skolian series. It's also the first one that I found boring. There's far too much information about the background of the Skolian Empire and more technical information than any of the other books in the series.If this is the first book in this series you've tried, read her other books before giving up on the series."
2,KEEP YOUR DISTANCE!,"Catherine Asaro, while she has amazing talent and plot ideas with enormous potential, she covers whatever good points this book could have had with the worst collection of filth i've ever read. Unless you are one of those...individuals who prefer to read novels involving explicit physical intimacy, I'd advise you to stay away from Catherine Asaro's works."
3,Asaro's weakest novel is still worth reading,"Catch the Lightning came as a suprise to me, since I read it immediately after completing Primary Inversion. I wanted a novel which continued the plot of Primary Inversion, which was written eventually. The novel contains more romance compared to her other novels, and the plot's focus drifts. Although the book gives us a glimpse of the greater Skolian timeline, it stands alone very well. I would recommend Primary Inversion over Catch the Lightning."
3,A good read.,I liked the tradional romance plot put in a very hard SF setting. I enjoy physics but I find it easier to take with a big dollop of my favorite brain candy. I had 2 problems with the book. The part where they are captured by the villains seems to wallow in sado-masochism and the story just sort of drifts to a stop. I haven't read any of the other Skolian books. A lot of potentially interesting stuff is refered to but doesn't seem to be covered in any of the other books.
5,Exactly what i was looking for,"This tablet is what you NEED if you are looking for a career in digital art and or design, period. Look no further"
1,Not for the faint of heart,This is a product for a very knowledgable graphics user. I am new to photo shop and thought this would be a good product to use as an interphase...NO WAY!! It is way over my head and after about 4 hours of failure I packed it up and sent it back to Amazon. Thanks for the quick return.. Amazon is great about these things
4,drawablity,This product is very helpful but there should be an 8x10 size. The 6x11 is much too small but the 9x12 is too large and bulky. Please come up with an in between. It is great to work with otherwize. The drawing tool is smooth and very easy to use. Just like pen and paper. The colors are amazing.
5,The ultimate tool for so many projects,"I have wanted a Wacom tablet for years. When I was finally able to afford one for myself, I decided to go for the gusto and get the big'un. This tablet has allowed me to express myself in the digital medium far more than I ever axpected. Being left-handed, I could never really draw anything on the computer with a mouse using my right hand, and I could never truly control a mouse with my left hand either. Now with this tablet and the pen-stylus, I can draw directly into the computer and create artwork in Corel Painter, Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, and I can draw frame-by-frame animation in Flash. There are too many new horizons to list for my creativity with this tablet. If you are creative and want to find a better tool to express yourself in the computer world, I STRONGLY suggest getting one of these tablet. Maybe not the biggest one, but at least one that will allow your creative juices to flow right onto your computer screen."
5,Wacom is a winner,"You can't go wrong with this drawing tablet. If you are retouching photos or creating art work from scratch this will make your life much easier. I had an old Wacom tablet from about 15 years ago and this new one is even better and easier to use. I have the 9x12"" actual drawing size and I see no reason for anything larger. It fits my needs perfectly. You might get buy with a smaller size but I think most people would find the 9x12 easier to use."
4,Detailed History Book,"Incredibly touching account of Japanese youth caught in the politics of America during and after the attack at Pearl Harbor. Very ""heavy"" with facts and reality. Amazing book."
5,The greatest story to come out of a terrible period of time,"Having read this book, from our local library before, I was so enthralled with the story that I bought two copies, one to keep to reread and the second to give to a man, who at 8 years old, went through the same experience as these children did. I am recording his experiences, and those of his siblings and I'm sure that ""Dear Miss Breed"" will help revive some of the experiences, both good and bad. This book is too good not to share with others."
5,An Amazing Book about an Amazing Woman,"What happens when America forgets her ideals and operates on fear, greed, and bigotry? In 1942, 120,000 Americans were put into prison camps just because the ""looked like"" the enemy. Joanne Oppenheim's fascinating account of the incarceration uses a unique perspective to give relevance to this stain on American history: the letters of the children who lived it.It turns out that Clara Breed, the children's librarian of San Diego, had entered into a correspondence with her young, incarcerated patrons and those letters are at the heart of this amazing read. The letters and books she sent to the children (and their informative responses) are at the heart of this documentary history, along with articles, photographs, cartoons, oral histories, and a wealth of other primary materials lovingly integrated by the author.Beyond a mere ""history"", the book is the story of how one person can make a difference - to history and to the lives of others."
3,I unexpectedly enjoyed it!,"I expected this parody book to make me laugh, which it did, but I never expected it to make me think. Laughter and thinking, what's better than that. This book is so much more than a parody!"
5,HILLARIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is no doubt one of the funniest things out there. Once you start, you can't stop laughing. Its content is anywhere from Unabomber Jackets to Wedgie Picks."
5,A great resource when you travel,"I bought this book for its enormous listings of more than 25,000 pet-friendly accommodations, petsitters, veterinarians and kennels in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It also has 50 pages of terrific advice from nationally know pet experts, like Matthew Margolis."
2,Mighty Machines-Revved Up,"I was disappointed in this DVD as I thought I was getting a DVD on Airplanes as my grandsons loves them, but instead the first 15 min or so was on how to build an airplane and then it takes off. Very boring to my 6 year old and he is very bright. The rest of the DVD covers tractors and trains and trucks and most of that is on the Mighty Machine DVD on Trains, so I feel like I was led wrongly by their advertising. The only fun part is when the plane took off and landed and the rest was boring."
3,Not much to do about airplanes!,"My 3.5 year old son and I have watched the entire Mighty Machine Series for Season 1 of which there are about 30 episodes. The 3 episodes included in this DVD are about making an airplane, the railway train, and something else (not related to flying). I thought this DVD was about flying and NOT one of the episodes from the first season of Mighty Machine. Ok, I didn't read the description correctly, but to say Planes! Mighty Machines in the cart isn't cool. In fact, there is an episode called In the Sky which is better than any of included episode, and it actually has a lot of plane flying. The cover on this DVD is misleading too. Read carefully before buying - not returning a seven dollar DVD, oh well."
2,boring for 2 1/2 yr old,"My 2 1/2 yr old grandson was going on a cross country car trip and I though this would show him some of the things he'd see along the way. he has a car DVD player so I thought he could watch it while driving. He was totally bored with the DVD and walked away after only a few minutes. It is a very mellow tape, perhaps he is used to something a little more loud and active. Anyways, a dud for us."
2,False advertising,I searched for a specific sku # for a stainless steel bracket.They sent me a galvanized bracket which I can not use and made it more expensive for me to return by charging me for their mistake.
5,Beautiful!,"This sturdy poster is rendered in beautiful colors that seem to pop off the black background. It's brightened up my sons' room, and has really inspired them to learn more about each of the planets."
2,Poor Moisture Management,"For those who are not at all concerned with moisture management, it provides a good cushion. I, however, am very disappointed with this tape. After about half an hour, the tape is so wet that it's hard to hold. After about an hour on my bike my fingers are actually pruning. I shall be replacing it with something else."
3,Good tape,"This is a good bar tape. It is nothing special. It is reasonably comfortable. It was pretty easy to install, much easier than other brands that I have used. I bought the urban camo for something to jazz up my bike, and it looks pretty neat on a blue bike. It is a subtle accessory on the bike."
4,Comfy.,"Not sure about the price, $15 is a bit much, but it holds up well and bounces back from being stretched improperly. Very forgiving and easy to wrap for a beginner. The plugs are nice enough, although don't seat as flush as I'd like. Nice to have reflectors there on my commuter.Just bought another roll for my tourer, I like it enough."
4,Great tape,"Great product, easy to apply and looks great on my 86 Raleigh Grand Prix. I will be purchasing more when the time comes."
4,Comfortable for sure.,"I love new handlebar tape. This stuff is very comfortable and quite grippy. I rode in the rain the other day, and had no problems at all with my hands slipping. I like that they include the 3 inch strips for behind the hoods, as well.Also, the back of the tape has a weak adhesive, to hold the tape in place while your wrap, but not so strong that you can't re-wrap. I've only wrapped a few times, so it was nice to be able to re-wrap and fix my mistakes."
4,"good quality, included finish tape too short",Happy with the quality and ease of installation. Feels good and worked well over the first 100 or so miles. Only downside was the length of the included finish tape. It barely goes around the bar more than once and seemed like it would allow the bar tape to unravel. I used stretchy black electrical tape instead and that is working well.
4,"Solide Tape, Good Price","I bought the two tapes, one orange and one brown, for my girlfriend and my bikes. First the orange was an awesome vibrant color and both tapes had a great squishy feel to them when they were on the handlebar. I put the tape on both bikes by myself with very light research online on how to do it and the bar tape looks great! The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that the strips of electrical tape they provide to hold the ends of the bar tape down are not very long or sticky so I had to put a drop of superglue on the end of each, but that worked great so no other complaints."
4,Good product,"Wrapped my tour bike handle with this (charcoal) after my previous handle tape disintegrated after many years. Looks good, feels tough. Would like it a bit more cushy though."
4,"Comfortable, durable, but prepare to break out the electrical tape","This tape is quite comfortable (for day-to-day use on drop bars). I've purchased three sets for three different bikes over the last few years.It's easy to install with one caveat: the actual adhesive tape provided to secure the ends of the bar tape to the bars is too short to wrap around a few times and properly secure it. My solution was to useElectrical Tapefor this, but that is an inconvenience if you don't already have the stuff lying around.The tape is very durable and stands up well to being left outside daily in rain and snow. It hasn't deteriorated or even faded noticeably after suffering from this kind of abuse for more than a year, including through an entire (Northeast US) winter.Overall, this stuff is a great value, and an easy way to improve your casual riding experience, especially if you're currently rocking an old ten speed with those petrified foam grips still clinging to the bars."
4,Pretty good tape.,"I really like the color and padded comfort of this tape. However, there is no adhesive whatsoever on the underside. While this make the tape far easier to apply, especially if you mess up and need to go back, it doesn't stay in place quite as well. While my tape has never actually come loose, it does move around a bit sometimes which can be a bit annoying. Overall, I really like it and would still recommend it to a friend."
4,Not a bag grip!,"My bike is from the 80's and it had the original grips on it. The bike had not been ridden a lot, but the grips were peeling and needed replacing. I decided upon this set of handle bar wrapping because of the good reviews. I'm not disappointed. It was extremely easy to work with. This was my first time wrapping handlebars, it it went really well. I love these new grips compared to what I was working with. They are comfortable, soft, and come in most colors. Not a bad purchase at all."
4,Slick and smooth,"This is just what I needed for my old bike. I'd recommend getting some shock absorbers for going under it, but even without them, it's plenty of comfort."
1,Extremely lackluster when compared to the major companies.,"I hated this tape, took hours to install, and in the end it just looked disgusting. The instructions were extremely vague. This tape (or the red color at least) gets dirty fast, and mine looked pink. Go with a real brand, this stuff is too important not to."
2,Just the movie,"I bought this DVD and it didn't had the bonus cartoons in it. It's just the crappy cartoon itself. It's better known as Countryside Bears in Europe. Dingo Picture movies here in the good ol' US, well I'd never!"
3,atypical,"I understand that this was Waysted's best selling album at the time, but for me, after Fin was gone, Pete Way's band went from inspired growling sloppy riff rock into predictable overproduced eighties hair band mediocrity, and this is the result. Paul Chapman is a very talented and usually exciting guitarist; his best work here is buried in the mix and it is a shame. Vaughan can sing, yes, but the result is a cross between Triumph and Poison at their worst. There are a couple of decent songs here, especially Heaven Tonight (and Fire Under The Wheels bonus track), but the rest just comes off sounding like Cinderella, and I don't mean that in a good way.Buy Vices or The Good The Bad The Waysted or Organized Chaos Live if you want to catch this band at their best."
4,Nice Suprise,"I've always been a Velvet Underground fan, but never really got into Lou's solo albums. I actualy bought the CD due to what Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan have done recently. I figured if those old-timer's could put out some great new stuff, than maybe Lou could as well. He did. This is a great rock record, which as we know is hard to come by these days. ""Paranoia in Key of E"" and ""White Prism"" are certainly stand-outs, but the disc as a whole is stellar. Give it a listen. I think you'll be as suprised as I was."
4,Back in the Saddle Again,"New York's favorite angry young whiner puts out his best album since the 70's.Of course that isn't saying much - practically every song he recorded in the eighties was basically a rewrite of ""I love you Susan,"" which was pretty weak in the first place.""New York"" was good but the lyrics had awkward meters that didn't match the music except the brilliant ""Dirty Boullevard"".Anyway, on this album he uses more than three chords on most of his songs, and although he still has the limited talents of this backup band, he delivers his best work in years.It's hard to rival ""The Velvet Underground and Nico"", ""Berlin,"" ""Rock and Roll Animal"" but this is definetely a big improvement.Maybe Dylan's latest classic woke him up. Or Even Liz Phair's first album. Good to see him back again. It definitely shows when he spends more than five minutes writing songs. Still, I wish he'd hook up with Bob Ezrin and the band from the mid seventies."
1,Maybe it's me?,"I love Lou and I just did not like this album at all. I thought that a couple of the songs were interesting, but, they didn't grab my heart. From my perspective, I thought the album was kind of lacking in the sparkling creativity that Lou has generally put out in the past. I'm getting older and that may be why I found large chunks of the music to be grating without redemptive qualities. Hey, Lou has put out tons of great music in the past, they can't all be pleasing to me (I understand) which stands up to the test of time."
1,First Lou Reed CD I purchased.,"I mainly bought this album because of the ""Rouge"" song which I heard on the movie ""Before Night Falls"". This was the only song, it turns out, that I liked. I don't like any of his songs in this album. The only other Lou Reed music I have is from when he was in The Velvet Underground. Why is it that most of the good singer songwriters in the 60's and 70's don't have great music later in their career. Like Robert Plant and others that have slipped my mind, can't listen to their late stuff either. I wish I could have just bought the Rouge song instead of the whole album."
1,Ecstacy?,"It's too loud, it's too long, it's too much jism (Baton Rouge is kinda nice but that's not enough)"
4,It's a wild ride,"There are cuts on ""Ecstasy"" that have more edge than perhaps any Reed has ever done. The CD is uneven in places, and there are a few cuts I'll probably get in the habit of skipping over on repeated listenings, but well over half the lengthy CD is utterly brilliant! You have to admire the sheer creative staying power for an artist of Reed's longevity to be creating his strongest, most original, most ""on edge"" work in the present, on this CD. If you're a Reed fan, this CD is a must. Even if you're not, there's plenty of rewards contained therein if you like groundbreaking rock 'n roll with more edge than the Grand Canyon. It's a complete original."
4,Great Deal!,I needed this book immediately for school. It arrived in time and in good condition. Before ordering I compared prices and this was the best deal. All around everything turned out perfectly.
3,bad copy,"It isn't fair to criticize the author for this so I won't give it a below-average star rating, but the book is not easily readable. For me the type is pretty small (Why can't Amazon tell us how did the type is before we buy? I am tryig to find a seller that does this. Many of us don't have the best eyes, and we could use the help.), but the publisher must have wanted to save money on ink because the print is too pale. The combination makes the book almost unreadable.I have discovered - at least I think this is true - that one can sometimes preview print size when the ad says ""Look inside this book,"" but that is only half of the story. The publisher has to be willing to use ink, and Amazon needs to reject publications that have pale printing."
1,False Advertising,I believe the company named this product Flameguard to defraud people looking for the Flameguard oven mitt that was the best buy recommendation by Cook's Illustrated. The name of the oven mitt is Best Guard. The maker is Crew Ware. I have no idea whether performance is the same. But SHAME ON Next Day Gourmet for using a name that does not represent the actual product and for intentionally keeping the description vague to get people like me to spend my money. BUYER BEWARE.
1,It leaks,"I bought this assuming it would save me water... but it leaks. When in the OFF position, it slowly let's water through... so it's never really OFF."
3,Nelson Auto Shut Off Timere,"The unit was easy enough to attach to the outlet. However, you cannot switch from timer and back to the ""On"" position without turning off the water completely and emptying all water in the hose. The pressure appears to be too strong for the unit to overcome. I bought another unit from a different manufacture and had no problem switching back and forth. This unit replaces a similar unit I bought some years ago. The older unit was easier to use. I could switch between auto and on with no problem. The unit was a little pricey."
2,Does Not Always Shutoff,"I bought this model after trying another one that had a problem with not shutting off sometimes. Unfortunately, this product has the same problem. I have no idea why it is so hard to make these right, but when you set it for an hour in the evening, and wake up 8 hours later to find the water still going, you get a bit upset. Big waste of water and an expensive water bill. Save yourself time and trouble and spend $30-$40 for a decent timer that will actually shutoff everytime!"
5,Great book for new guys!,I am just getting into movie making and was clueless on lighting. This book explains basic lighting as well as different set ups you can use. It also goes over the different names and types of lighting equipment used in the industry. Very useful and easy to understand information. I would highly suggest this book to my friends.
4,Great for DV Shooters!,"I found that this book was full of good information. I have been shooting in the DV format for nearly ten years and I definately learned some new tricks. John Jackman brings a great mix of technical and artistic ideas into his approach of lighting. This book is great for the beginner as well as the seasoned veteran. I would have liked to see more on lighting for the moving camera and action, but that's a whole other book."
2,Dinner Plate pattern defect,"We have owned a set (made in England) for many years and wanted to buy another set because we like it so much. To our dismay, the pattern on the new dinner plates was quite pale and faded compared to the more vibrant blue on the rest of the set (and compared with our older set). We advised Amazon and they sent us another set but the dinner plate pattern was still off. It seems the dinner plate stock is different from that of the rest of the set. It is still a lovely pattern and this problem may not disturb you but caveat emptor."
1,Does the set from England exist?,I waited 3 months for this item(which was on backorder) when I got it the set was from COLUMBIA. This is not what I ordered. I wanted the set from England.The pattern on the dishes were vibrant but the salad plates were dull and there was a big difference. The pattern was blurry and not what I expected. The dishes were nicely packed. I did send the item back.I was able to buy the series from an ebay seller two years ago.
1,Not the real Churchhill China Finlandia Dinnerware,Do not buy it!If you are looking for a cheap replica - than go ahead!
1,Awful,I saw this set and it looked very nice. When I received the set I first noticed how poorly it was packed (loose plates). There were 4 chipped plates in the set.So I returned and tried another. When I got the next one I realized that some looked bright and radiant and a handful looked faded like they were photocopied on. Cheap. Beautiful design but terrible terrible quality. So the second is going back. I am very disappointed. Unless you want to be playing buy and return...Skip this one until the company gets their act together and puts out a worthy set.
1,Beware of the Columbian manufacturer dinnerware,I was late in the game in discovering the beauty of the Finlandia pattern. I absolutely love the blue-and-white design and ordered a set of dinnerware from Amazon. My set of dinnerware came from Columbia. The pattern coloration was uneven and so was the design placement. The quality of the Colombian dinnerware seemed cheap.We ended up buying a set of used Finlandia dinnerware from another source. The British made Finlandia dinnerware is beautiful.Durability is not the best as this dinnerware is not made from porcelain or demi-porcelain. It is earthenware that has been glazed to protect the pattern.
4,"Good, but flawed.","The flag appears much like it does in the photo, and the quality of manufacture is solid. However, the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the presence of two small green stains on either side of the yellow border. There's also some discoloration (a long, yellow strip) on the white part of the flag where the grommets are. However, this isn't a huge deal to me, as this is intended for indoor display."
2,cheap,"cheap and falls off at first breese of the day ... had to bend hooks to stay on tree. found this out the hard way, broke hummingbird feeder"
2,not for me,"I tried these ant guards for they looked okay and the price was right. However, when I found that ant repellant had to be added to the inside of the bell, I did not use the guards. I use a similar product that is self contained. Complete. No additives are necessary.Margaret Marshall"
4,"wow,bob, wow......","ok, 4.5 stars: the only reason i didn't give it 5 is because it left me wanting more! the songs are powerful and diverse, obviously rooted in honesty and genuine experience; someone who lives for her art. refreshing! nice cd cover/art, too....can't wait to see them live!"
3,"This is America? Lawrence, KS in the 60s","Great look at how social change occurred in Mid-America, at a small campus town full of a very rebellious population!"
3,rug shampoo,"I have found that almost all rug shampoos can be toxic to pets if not rinsed off and allowed to dry completely which may have explained the illness of my cat. I have since switched to cleaning my carpets with vinegar and water as well as rinsing since there are times when the pets can't be kept off the drying carpet. After spending much time researching this topic, most of these shampoos attract more dirt due to the coating of the carpet fibers from the chemicals."
5,Seems to work very well,"I'm not the wordiest person, but I can say that we use this regularly in our SteamVac and it works very well. The carpets always look super when we are done, and feel good too."
3,Was it a False Start,"Ordered this book because my creative writing teacher had written it. Actually have never read it but might some day. It was as described and when I see it, I remember that I need to start writing again...several false starts before the real thing I guess. I don't remember having any issues with shipping...condition is as described."
4,His Last Bow,"Not really based on Doyle, but Holmes does come out of retirement to foil a German plot in 1913. The plot itself is only fair, but Cushing and Mills more than make up for that in their performances and teamwork. They have the best chemistry as Holmes and Watson since Rathbone and Bruce. It's too bad failure to find financial backing and Cushing's failing health prevented any further films from being made. The supporting cast was also good. Gutsy casting, not one major player cast was under sixty at the time!"
1,wished I hadn't bought it,"I'm admittedly a little picky about my music (I mean why waste your time listening to mediocre music when there is so much incredible music available) but I don't think there is one halfway decent song on this album. I actually don't remember why I bought this CD other than the 2 glowing reviews posted, but I wish I hadn't. Sorry."
3,Good solid receipt printers,"Although it is a bit confusing because it is listed as a Samsung but is actually a Bixolon (sister company?) printer and installs as such. I have had some problems after unplugging and plugging back in in a different usb port I had to uninstall and reinstall the printer. Other than that it has been a trouble free, easy to reload with paper, and decently fast receipt printer."
1,The little printer that wont print,"WHEN the printer decided to print, the print is miniscule. 99% of the time, it won't print, even though I get the message that it is ready and it shows items to be printed in the que. I can't seem to find the seller about an exchange. Frustrating"
3,Adequate introductory text,"This is a good introductory text to the topic of slavery, but not great. It is incomplete because it overemphasizes slavery in pre-industrial times, and nearly ignores slavery in the 20th century, especially in regards to prison labor. The book does have a wide geographical reach, and touches on slavery in many parts of the world. I suggest this book as a good introductory text to those without prior knowledge in the subject."
1,not what it once was!!!,"save your money,go to the discount store,buy the chinese knock offs!! this glass in no way is waterford quality,the rim is very thick.there is no fire or sparkle to it.i own a good lot of crtystal,this is just a piece of heavy,expensive glass"
5,"Beautiful, elegant, substantial drinkware","When I removed the drinking glass from the well-protected Waterford box, I knew I had made the right choice. The piece is elegant -- heirloom quality. The lead crystal has its own presence... and is of substantial heft. The cut delivers a parade of rainbows from any light source. GORGEOUS! The photo on the product page did not do justice to the actual item.Please know that, unless the item description mentions otherwise, this is not a set, and you will be receiving ONE (1) old fashion glass per order. This was not disclosed on the item page when I ordered the glass, so I ordered another to be prepared for a party I hosted. The quantity comment should in no way be interpreted as a negative regarding the item in any way... it's just the product page that failed to mention how many I would receive. I brought this oversight to Amazon's attention, so hopefully this information will be added.This lovely drinking glass is terrific in every sense. Cheers!"
5,Very attractive whiskey glasses,I have been purchasing these glasses over a period of 3 or 4 years now. They are gifts to both of my sons-in-law. The crystal is well appreciated and gets used on a regular basis. Glasses are beautiful and sturdy.
5,"The rover, a wonderful novel of adventure and suspense.","In the Rover, Wick is a 3rd level librarian at the vault of all knowledge. When he delivers a package to the yondering docks he is swept away by curiosity and finds himself in more adventure than he has ever imagined. He is shainghaied by pirates, picked up by theives and solves a puzzle that leads to treasure beyond imagining.I think that this is a great book, I've read it over and over again, and if you've ever read The Sword of Shannara, The Dragonlance chronicals, The Forgotton realms chronicals or The Lord of the rings you'll love this book."
3,The Cover Illustration,"This is not a rating of the book, which I have not read. It is meant to inform the reviewers who have mentioned the cover illustration, e.g., ""who is the other halfer with Wick"" or ""the guy in Robin Hood gear.""Folks, brethren, fellow fantasy lovers, where are your roots? That cover picture is by the Brothers Hildebrand and it depicts the confrontation between Frodo and Sam (the little guys, you know, hobbits) and Faramir and his Rangers of Ithilien, as described by JRRT on page 312 (paperback edition) of The Two Towers.And how in the name of decency and reason the publishers of Mr. Odom's work dared, had the audacity, had the unmitigated gall, or even had the legal right, to put a Tolkien illustration on the cover of someone else's book, I will never know. They should be ashamed of themselves--and so should Mel Odom, if he had anything to do with it (which he probably did not.)The guy in the Robin Hood outfit, indeed. Read the classics before you read the fluff."
2,The Rover,"The Rover by Mel Odom isn't the worst book I've read, but it is subpar. Odom's main character, Edgewick ""Wick"" Lamplighter, is boring. The secondary characters outshine Wick and the first part of this book drags terribly. It isn't until the introduction of the thieves that the book gets interesting. Sadly, that interest isn't sustained. Subsequent events prove predictable and uninspired. With that said, younger readers might enjoy this book more than older readers. Personally, I think I'll pass on the sequals."
2,"If I hear ""The little librarian...""","...one more time, I'm going to vomit.Okay, so I'm a grammar geek. I admit it. And I didn't make it all the way through this book. I admit that too. (I have two reliable sources giving reviews of opposite polarity, so it appears to be a matter of taste.) The premise isn't bad, although somewhat lacking in imagination since it seems to build on The Hobbit without giving credit in that direction. I was actually disappointed that I couldn't finish it --- but I just couldn't get beyond the author's mental stutter.Future Reader, may you avoid the curse to count the number of times this phrase appears. On average, Odom uses ""the little librarian"" three times per PAGE. That's about every other paragraph. Mel, man! Find a different phrase to describe your hero, or at the very least, just call him Wick! And what was your EDITOR, Brian M. Thomsen, smoking? You both flunk my English class!"
2,Kindle version very disappointing,"The book is quite good, but the Kindle version is very disappointing -- all the mathematical equations and symbols are very poorly presented. It looks like someone OCR'd the paper version and presented the botched results as a Kindle ebook. It is abundantly clear that no checking was done -- brackets are missing, whole sections of equations are missing or cropped, symbols are five times the size of the text, alphas are presented as ""a"", negative signs missing... it's a shocking mess.Considering that the book was probably originally composed using Tex or Latex, this is completely unacceptable. Not cheap either, considering the fact that nobody bothered even to check it before publishing."
5,Brief comments,This book can be considered as a supliment of Potter's book. It mentioned many points not found in Potter's. It is very short in British style 'monography'.
3,vonage d-link adapter review,"The product works fine except for one thing. I cannot connect my OKI laser printer to it and have it network wirelessly with my other computers (not compatible). Luckily, I have two adapters and the other Linksys wireless adapter does work with it."
1,Avoid,"I bought this router because my old Linksys Vonage Wireless Router caused a delay when receiving calls. I connected this up and everything was fixed! Actually, this has caused more problems.Now when I visit websites I get random ""Server Not Found"" errors. It's not my web browser, cable model, email or configuration. It also happens on my other PC.It also randomly would occur in Thunderbird, in my FTP program and my Postage software. I switched out the router and everything works fine again.My opinion is that all the Vonage Wireless Routers are garbage. I'm done with Vonage. They were great a year ago and have now ent way downhill. I'll pay an extra $20 month to not deal with so so many problems."
1,Best to avoid this one...,"My issue is that this router loses it's security settings every time it's rebooted. This happens a lot in my area because we have power outages a lot, so it powers back up, doesn't reload the security settings, and thus leaves a security hole in my home network. Kind of a bad design in my opinion. Doing a manual reset to the correct security settings is certainly possible, but seems to be finicky (it requires a login to a web-based utility) and usually takes me a few tries to get it working correctly. Drives my wife and I crazy.Instead of an integrated wireless/VoIP solution, I'll spend about the same money and get a better standalone wireless router and a better standalone VoIP adapter. This one isn't worth your money."
1,Dont waste your money,"I like Vonage and I like D-Link, but somehow together they dropped the ball on this one. See the above review on the router's problem with keeping its security settings. I have the same problem. Every time it loses power you have to manually reset your security settings and passowrd. And you have to try fiveor six times before it will ""take"". I called Vonage, their great suggestion was I should buy a new router. They offered to send me a new non-wireless VOIP device..they won't support this router. D-Link? They refer you to Vonage..they don't even HAVE a firmware update which might fix the problem. My advice, stay away from this dog."
1,Worst router I've ever had,"I bought this after my LinkSys wireless Vonage router failed to survive a move. It has been problematic from day one. The wireless signal strength is weak; the wifi connection speed is slow, often gets dropped, and has trouble reconnecting. And now, less than 6 months after buying it, it's started to periodically lose all connectivity (wired, wireless, even phone) every few hours. The only solution I've found for this is to briefly unplug and re-plug the thing, which solves the problem for a while -- although 20% of the time I do this, it completely loses all the settings I'd programmed it with, forcing me to change the admin password, SSID, and wifi password over and over again. It's irritating to no end.You're better off finding something else (or, more likely, a pair of something elses -- VOIP router and WIFI router)."
1,Dlink VWR Router - DO NOT BUY this Router!,"I Purchased this router in April 2011. Everytime we have a power outage, it loses it configuration. First I thought that I hadn't saved the settings properly, but found out that it just loses them anyway!After 2 months, I finally called Dlink for support. They told me that this router was made OBSOLETE on April 1, 2008, and that there was no support for it.I purchased this thru Genesis17:7 on Amazon. I contacted them and they refused to refund my money. They told me that I purchased a Used-Like New Router, and so there was no warranty. I paid $149.95 for this router. Doesn't sound like a used one to me based on price. Right now, today, they have this same router listed for $199. Used, Like New routers (Exact Same Model Number) on Amazon are listed for $15 - $39. DON'T buy this router, and don't buy ANYTHING from GENESIS17:7. They are rip-off artists."
1,Piece of Junk - Do Not Buy - Non-Secure,"Do not buy this box. I've vonage for multiple years, and have loved it. I just bought this box by my old Linksys router is dead. After talking to Vonage, I can confirm the box loses all security settings AND it won't work with Vista DHCP on wireless or wired - you need to use static IP address settings. The voice quality is fine.This issue has existed for over a year, but D-Link and Vonage continue to rip customers off by selling these boxes. Tech support says there should be a fix in the future and the Vonage forums (non-official source) say there should be a firmware fix in May of 2009. I doubt it. Most likely it is a hardware issue that will never be fixed."
2,the previews are longer than the show,"Waste of money. Seriously, the previews are longer than the show, including the 4 shorts (very short shorts) they add to the show. I got this on sale and I still feel like I wasted my money."
4,Only on DVD?,"I wish I could give this Four Stars because the show (and the mini-sequels) itself are so awesome, but the fact that it's not coming out on Blu-ray after waiting all these years makes me cry in my cocoa."
4,"Great movie, but...","This is a great movie. I knew ahead of time it was short and while I think this is very overpriced for the lenght of the movie, I bought it anyway because I like it. My complaint is that Disney didn't bother to take out where the commercial breaks were when this was a TV show. Seriously, for this kind of money they really should have fixed it so it was a seamless DVD. In one scene an elf is trying to open a door and the screen literally goes black for a second because that's where the commercial break was, and then it comes back on a second later. Very disappointed they didn't clean that up before releasing the DVD."
2,Why would anyone buy this?,We thought this was a movie but it is a cartoon.. only a few minutes long. What a waste of our time and money.
4,Cute movie...kids loved it,"I would rate this 5 stars if it were longer. For the price it should have been a full length movie. It was cute and with all the extras it made it not so bad. Both the kids were glued to the t.v. while watching this and they liked the extras as well. Although when it was over they both asked if that was it. I would recommend it, just know it's not a full length movie. It's a few shorts."
3,"Cute, but not worth more than $5","This movie is cute, but I didn't realize it was under a half hour long. I paid $14 for what I thought was a full length movie. This is my fault, but I wanted others to realize that it was a short movie before paying full movie price. I arrived in great condition and within the delivery timeframe."
5,Prep and Landing DVD,My kids love this movie and I was thrilled to find it online this year! It's a cute film for christman lovers!!!
4,"Oh yes, the taste/smell is that bad but . . .","If you can get past the initial shock of the smell and color, I suppose you could do it as a shot but I am not so daring. The smell is horrible, as is the appearance & I couldnt even bring myself to taste it straight - I have, however, found that if I mix it in with a glass of grape juice, the taste & smell are pretty much neutralized and I can fool myself into thinking that I am drinking a glass of grape juice. So far its working. I'm a pretty picky eater and if I am completely turned off by the smell, I usually wont eat something - the grape juice is working. I have only been taking it for about a week so for results, Im not there yet but I am willing to do a 60 day trial now that I have found that I can mask the taste with certain juices or in a smoothie . . . The vitamin content is incredible and if it matches the claims, it will be more than worth the trouble. Heres to hoping it works . . ."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,THIS PRODUCT IS PURCHASED FOR SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERSALL LOVE IT.... REALLY IS A GREAT PRODUCT...REALLY LOVE IT. HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A WHILE.
1,YUK !!!,This tastes so much like cod liver oil. I could not take it. My mouth still twists everytime I think about swallowing it. Ended up throwing it away.
5,Miracle Energy,"I decided to try a liquid vitamin instead of taking a multi tablet and adding so many other tablets of minerals, amino acids, omegas, and anti oxidants. Miracle 2000 has it all in just two tablespoons. I can hardly believe the energy I have had from the first dose! I teach Group Exercise in the morning and my classes have noticed that I have become a real dynamo."
5,I love it,"I love this product. I have found that I have more energy. I used to suffer from constipation, but I am a lot more regular with this product (and the good part is no diarrhea!). I agree with the review that the green liquid tastes awful, but I just take it like a shot and drink a full glass of water to wash it down. If I don't drink water with it, or mix it in a glass of juice I do suffer from stomach cramps for about 3 minutes though. But overall this is a wonderful product. I don't like having to take several different vitamins in addition to a regular multi-vitamin. The Miracle 2000 has it all. It has algae, l-lysine, stevia, the list goes on and on. I have lost wieght without exercise or changing my diet. I also went to their website [...], but I prefer to buy their products from Amazon because their website kinda sucks."
5,He's still got it!,"Older, but not unlike a find wine, Jackie Chan keeps getting better and better with age. Out of his usual role, Jackie plays a ""not so good guy"" in this film. By the end, he shows us the soft-hearted ""hero"" we're used to. This is a different kind of character for Jackie but he proves, once again, that he's an ACTOR - not ""just a stuntman"". Oh, and if you think the singer of the title song sound's likes Jackie's voice - you're right!"
5,great 2 track,"tbis 2 track single is great, the video would of been a great bonus but i bet she got plans for doing a dvd with all her videosso anway i love the remix of wake up the real version i didn't like but this version is nothingless then cool!!love,Katy"
1,Horrible,This Girl CANNOT sing what so everr and needs to continue with acting even though shes not that good with acting
5,INCREDIBLE!!,"If you are thinking about buying this CD, do it. If you weren't thinking about buying this CD, do it anyway. It's well worth your money. Harsh Krieger has a way with words and melodies that span far beyond many pop/rock bands today. It's truly refreshing to hear the sound from this new band, and its evident in the strength of their first single ""Home"" that they've indeed got staying power. Add this one to your music collection for sure."
5,A pretty good little movie,"Yes, parts of this movie are, as one of the reviewers said, a little cheesy. But the dialogue is so strangely real and true to life that you feel like you become best friends with the characters. The situation that arises feels as if it is happening to you. The movie has a lesson to teach, although medical technology has advanced a great deal since the film was made. This movie is definately all about sex and not for the innocent. It was originally a t.v. movie appropriately called, ""The Loss of Her Innocence."" Although the movie may have had its faults, I feel like I cannot give it any less than five stars, since its impact is so great. My boyfriend, the big tough guy, was even battling tears at the end. The characters in this film make it worth the watching, acted out spectacularly by four young actors who could have gone on to great things, but preferred to stay in the undertow."
3,"Kinda cheesy, but still really good...you know?","I actually saw this movie on late-night TV. Some parts could have been done better, but the characterization was actually quite good. Some of the dialogue was quite funny, especially between Besty Slade and Pamela Sue Martin. All in all, this film had the right mix of coming-of-age comedy and drama."
3,Not a Made-for-TV movie,"I'm a little confused by some other reviews claiming this was originally a made-for-TV movie. It was not. My mother and I watched this on the big screen when it was originally released in 1974. We both wept at the end, which we were not expecting. We still enjoyed the movie, though. I don't really remember a lot of foul language, either."
3,Our Time delivers on tearful look back.,"The film, ""Our Time"" is a sweet and soulful look back at the challenges and consequences of coming of age love and sex. Though its an nostalgic period piece, the messages of love, expectations and woman's reproductive rights are timeless. CAUTION: it is a three tissue viewing!"
1,not worth the time to download,Very disappointing. Inaccurate information. Started reading but realize quickly it was not worth my time. Even though it is free I still deleted it from my kindle.
1,Grassroots Tyranny can kiss my grits,"This is the worst political book I've ever read. Clint Bolick is a mad man! Has he ever even seen grass? Much less grassroots? I think not (since he lives in Arizona... I've been keeping an eye on you, Clint ;). Will there be no end to Bolick's ramblings? I suggest you steer clear of this book and this avowed and blatantly obvious mouthpiece for the Democratic party! Harry Brown in 2004!"
4,Review of Everyday Magic by Ladynever,I found Everyday Magic easy to read and understand. It is relavent to the modern world. The rituals are simple (mostly) and the supplies were easy to get. I would have liked the substitutions to have been more clear.
5,I quite enjoy this book,"Yes, the spells are simple. But whoever said that magic only works when it is complex? In fact, I think that with simple and straightfoward methods there is much MORE opportunity to raise energy (as opposed to fussing over getting a complicated ritual ""right"") As a long time practitioner I do write my own spells - and have adapted some of Morrison's - but I use many of her spells exactly as they appear. Her materials are accessible, her logic is sound, and her spells will work for beginners and experts alike. I must add that the ""Trinka Five"" spell she includes is one of the two most successful money spells I've ever used - upon it's completion I recieved three consecutive ""past tax adjustments"" (completely unexpected) totalling over $1200."
5,it was ok,Book was not exactly the one I wanted but by same person this book is missing some of the material that the other one had the cover is all wrong as well mine is a brown cover book is still good and by same author but yeah thought i was getting a different book i guess this is a rewrite
3,A 50-50 Read.. Not worthy of 5 stars but worthy of 3 :),Though this book was wonderful reading and I enjoyed it.. I have read better and yet I have read worse.. The spells are great.. and the information is wonderful.. however I wish that the author had been more thorough but this won't keep me from recommending this book. :) Blessed Be
1,Simplistic,"This book provides only the most basic information. I'd consider it to be almost elementary school level. It's not even a book of instruction, so I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. This book is only one that I would offer people who want it the easy way and aren't too worried about getting results. Dorothy Morrison seems like she just spewed out any idea for a quick spell, and this is just a book of spells. She also doesn't seem to encourage people to write their own spells, which in my opinion is always more effective because you can do what works for you, and you have the added power of the creation of the spell incoporated into it. One piece of advice, don't waste your money folks."
2,Good recipies & a bunch of Hocus Pocus,"Definately not for anyone serious in kitchen witchcraft, but great for a few laughs and light reading."
5,Great book for modern days,"This book is very helpful.It is full of info to help you to understand all.It has things that can be found in todays world to do spells with ,instead of hard to find things .It's a MUST read for all. I hope she(the author) writes many more."
5,Great for Beginners!,I started getting into wicca last May and her book was a huge help! She knows what she is talking about!
4,All In One Book,"Every spell you need is in this book , easy to do and simple to understand. All kinds of neat spells for all occasions"
3,Everyday Magic Review,"If you've already been studying Wicca, this is an alright book chocked full of spells and simple charms.While I appreciate having a quick reference book for spells, to me, this book and the author suffer from having Llewellyn publish it. Where all to often books from this Publication aren't of a high or strong enough caliber. That somehow, their books end up being clones, especially where the 101 books are concerned, just a slightly different twist or flair to apply to a different tradition. Too many of their books come off as light hearted and fluffy bunny.That said, Everyday Magic is still a good book and reference for spells. And that's largely all it is, just spells."
5,Spells for everything!,"This book is great for anyone! It has all the info you need about herbs,oils,colors,the winds,moon,and everything else that goes along with spells! The spells are for anything and everthing..and they work! Especially when you need to find a parking space close to the store, LOL. E-mail me at nikki_xpac@hotmail.com for more info or trading of spells! AWESOME BOOK!"
4,An iteresting aproach,"This is a very interesting book. It contains spells to protect your computer, parking space, and many more up to date items. It is a good starter book."
4,some real gems in this book...,"Everyday Magic is about just that.. the magic we need everyday. I don't know any other author who has published a spell to improve modem speed! Many people will undoubtadly go straight to the grimoire in back, but they will miss some of the gems in the first half of the book, including a version of the old standby ""an it harm none"" spell rider that works much better than any other version I've seen. Definately worth adding to your reference library!"
1,Writer needs lesson in Craft ethics,"This book gives no deference to the Craft, in my opinion. The ""spells"" listed do not use a circle, no deference to the deities, nothing. Just ""throw this together and it's done."""
4,Still Rockin.,"At my first thought, no Buzz Sherman no Terry Juric, No Moxy. Well I was so wrong as this come back CD is just what the doctor ordered, yes Brian Maxim is no Buzz Sherman but then who is. He is a fine vocalist is his own right and the songs are fitting to his style and voice, Bill Wades drums are just as hard as ever and no one matches the guitar duo of Buddy Caine and the great Earl Johnson. For the true blue Moxy fan this is a keeper and now even more so that band has not only lost Buzz, but also in the past year one of the greatest drummers of all Bill Wade. The band continues to show the experience of time that has made them one of the finest rock bands ever, they have a new live cd out so check it out. (Just my view, but the ""Under The Lights"" w/ Michael Rynoski- Mike Reno never was and never will be a real Moxy Cd.)"
1,ineloquent fiction,Has some decent stories mixed in here and there if you're into fiction. But the story arcs and narrative styles seem to change chapter by chapter. Odd for a book that had an entire council deliberate on its content (see: Nicaea).Might be better off reading Lord of the Rings.
5,An Excellent Buy!,The Bible I purchased is a terrific study Bible at an exceptional price. I had been to many book stores and not seen anything like it for the price. The large print Bibles are usually twice the price and sometimes so heavy these old hands can't carry such weighty Bibles around. This Bible was sent amazingly fast and it sits on my desk ready for use at this moment!
3,the Good Book,"It is a little larger than I expected, but is a large print version ofthe King James Version Bible that I wanted."
3,nice big font but font too light shade of grey.,We liked the book in-spite of its size. Just was shocked when we saw how light the font was. way too light. The font actually looked sun bleached. For the money they charge for the book you would think they could spare more ink to darken the font. If i could return it and have it done right I would of. But I doubt I can find another replacement with big and dark fonts.
4,King James Version Holy Bibles,"I was surprised at how big the Bibles were when they arrived. Really too big to carry to church, but love the print and the fact that it is leather bound. The print is very clear and easy to read."
4,Good for those who are hard of seeing,I got this for my mother-in-law who can't read unless the letters are really big. This bible did the trick and she is able to be inspired and calmed in times of difficulty.
3,Surprised,"It was at a great price,but I was shocked when I received it. It looked like a normal sized bible but it was very large that was the only disappointed thing about my purchase"
3,"Holy Bible, Giant Print Deluxe Edition: King James Version",It was huge and I bought another to replace it. It did have large print but it was too big to carry to church.
2,Too Big...,"I bought this bible hoping to replace my current bible that I take to church. However, the bible itself is too carry to church and the pages are very thin and can be easily thorn. I use it as a at home study bible, because the print is very large and easy to read. If I had to purchase again I wouldn't though."
2,Not as advertized,"The product description said ""buttery soft"" genuine leather. What i got was not leather, nor was it ""buttery soft"" anything. The book itself is also quite huge, which is likely the only reason it is called ""Deluxe"". I returned it and Amazon was great."
2,Not great for a quick read,"The book is too long, bleak and unappealing. The constant reminder of this so called ""god"" character was repeated too much and got old. It wasn't a good read. I suggest The Lord of the Rings."
2,Bad Quality,I didn't expect too much for the price but I was really disappointed with the quality.The cover is very flimsy and the book is larger than I expected. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,large print bible,"This bible is put together nicely, however; the print isn't as large as you would think. When I saw ""giant print"" I thought wow great....but I was disappointed that it was no bigger than any other ""large"" print book."
5,Holy Bible,I like the large text as well as the weight of the book. This is not a small book if you are concerned about weight. It is very nice. Jesus words are in red in this book. A friend of mine purchased one similar to the presentation edition offered here and the red text was not there and he was disappointed. I purchased this one for him as well. I give bibles as gifts to Christ believers and think that I will send this to many more people.
5,"Holy Bible, Giant Print Edition","Holy Bible, Giant Print, I love this edition because of the size of the print. I can read it much better than any bible I have. This is the 3rd one I have ordered because friends have noticed mine and asked me to get one for them."
5,Holy Bible,"Of course this is a great weapon, my life, my everything and i love this gaint print bible. I would recommend it to everyone."
2,They didn't match!,"I ordered the bibles, index tabs and bible covers as a set. The bibles were much too large for the covers and had to be returned. I was very disappointed. I went back and checked to see if there was a size mentioned...there was not so I assumed they would fit the covers. I have learned to not assume anything when ordering from Amazon. Mary A."
4,Pleased,I bought this Bible for my 84 year old mother. She seems pleased with it because she can lay it flat and the print is large enough to read easily. The only downfall may be it's size which I would compare to a 8X10 picture.
4,Very Presentable,I am completely pleased with the purchase of this item. It gives you the thrill needed to keep reading the good book. very legible and consise. with well constructed calendas or timetables to follow for different studies. Highly recommended.One.
5,Beautiful Bible,"I have purchased this Bible and it is very Large but Beautifully Presented. It contains Several Maps of The Holy Land and the names of the places refered to in the Bible on the maps. It has a concordance that gives the reader information on everything, from weights and measurements, Bible Terminology,even plants and animals. It explains the meaning of words that we are not familiar with and words that we may be familiar with. The words of Jesus are in Red. Could not ask for better. Very easy on the eye when reading.Holy Bible, Giant Print Deluxe Edition: King James Version"
4,big,"this is a very nice bible, i didn't pay attention to the measurment size and it is really big overall i would recommend it for anyone who's looking for a large print bible"
1,The Bible,"I found this collection of books hard to follow, The authors ramble a bit at times, and the ending is open ended with seemingly no follow-up book. Its like a trilogy with only 2 books. The main character of the book seemed a bit too child-like, plus the story of the son seemed a bit too repetitive. I would only recommend this book for those interested in mythology and research into Christianity."
2,Flimsy cover!!,"The cover on this Bible LOOKS nice, but it's a flimsy, paper, easily creasable cover.If I had seen or touched this edition in a store prio to purchase, I'd never have bought it."
2,not adequately described,"this is a very large bible (8-1/2 x 11). Had it been adequately described, I would not have selected this item. Additionally, there was a ""restocking"" fee assessed upon return & the total credit amount refunded was less than 50% of the item price. Not a good experience on this item."
4,Wonderful Story!,If you are looking for a story filled with powerful characters from warriors and kings to a talking donkey and a parthenogenesis zombie than this is a story for you! The plot keeps you on your toes and I enjoyed this psuedo historic work merged with fantastic mythology that really brings out an aura of mystical feel to reading it. Some parts are abit choppy but other than that it is right up there with Lord of the Rings.
4,Large print enhances understanding,"Wonderful to read the Bible in large font for the first time in my life. I appreciate reddish letter for the Lord's words. Would have liked a more detailed description of the product before ordering it (font size, book size) but am enjoying it nontheless."
5,The best guide to a happy life.,"The King James Version (KJV) Holy Bible for Kindle: The Old & New Testaments, Deuterocanonical literature, Glossary & Suggested Reading List. ILLUSTRATED by Gustave Dore (Mobi Spiritual)This book is unabridged and comes with gold leaf and Jesus words in red for easy identification. Unabridged as this is the only way for it to be a guide to life as God intended. With peace, love and truth."
2,too heavy about 4 pounds,"cover is thin and creases easily - the size of the print is excellent, but its too heavy to cary around."
5,"Life treasure for yourself, amazing gift for friends","After reading some other reviews which said the leather cover was poor, I was a bit worried, but ordered one copy anyway. The leather cover is beautiful and soft, very high quality. The book comes perfectly packed. A wonderful life treasure for yourself, or an amazing gift for friends. Highly recommended!"
2,NOT FULLY WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR,THE GIANT PRINT DOES MAKE IT EASY TO READ. HOWEVER I'M USE TO THE OLD BIBLES THAT HAVE SCRIPTURES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER SCRIPTURES AND THIS BIBLE DOESN'T. SO THAT MAKES IT HARD TO CROSS REFERENCE SCRIPTURES TO OTHERS. ALSO THE CONCORDANCE IS NOT AS DETAILED AS MY OLD BIBLE... I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
3,Red print,"Red print: not a good idea. Theologically speaking, Christ's words in red print could suggest that the red print carries greater weight than the rest of Scripture, which is untrue. All Scripture is the inspired Word of God. And since Christ is God, there is then no sense in putting His words in red. The best Bible is a King James in all black print with no commentary on the same pages as the Scripture."
1,"Almost, but not quite, as hard to read as Ayn Rand.","The Holy Bible has the same feel of excessive, vapid exposition, overbearing, soul crushing despair and total failure to understand how humans actually behave, but isn't quite as boring as Rand.The bible makes much better use of modern plot conventions by negating itself and changing the canonical story mid-flow, as opposed to Rand's pedantic insistence on linear plot flow, but it still comes off as old fashioned and totally out of date."
5,kingjamesdefender,"King David is a proven person in history- google it... and if you don't have faith you will never believe anything God spoke.why would people leave notes on books they would never buy- this is my 3 rd copy. lesfeldick.org is a great King James teacher, for the bad reviewers . God says his word (KJAV) will be as foolishness to the unbelievers- God is always right......."
2,batteries not included????,"came with NO ac adapter, NO usb cable, and NO software.......product description on amazon.com site does NOTmention this at all....packing slip does say items are notincluded. Product description on amazon.com site also says itcomes with software, not that I needed it, but alsomisleading. I can understand NO usb cable but NO ac adapter?Good thing I have a background in electronics and severalold/used adapters, guess I have to make one up or go to RadioShack or something. Wonder if it even works? Merry Christmas??Whatever."
1,Review,"This item was incredibly disappointing. The hard drive was fine, but it came with no connecting cord. Because IBM has been discontinued, there is no cord available. It appears to be false advertising and I would not recommend this seller at all. I am incredibly disappointed."
3,imperfect,Everything was ok but was bent at corner.Too big of a hassle to return.Same thing happened to my wife through Amazon. Might go back to having orders shipped to my local Barnes and Noble where I can examine it.
4,Nice Menus and Meals,"First off, if you haven't bought ""Betty Crocker Cooking Basics"" buy that one first. It has much simpler all-American meals in it than this one. You will probably find this book to be the most useful if you are putting on a party because it breaks down complete menus, prep-time timelines (ex: 2 days before the party do ____), entertaining tips, and decorating tips. It also has a fantastic section on estimating the food requirements of large groups of people.I do think that this is a good guide for any kitchen (especially beginning cooks) because it has one of the most easy-to-read formats that I have found; it is full of lovely pictures, techniques, and nutritional info. The best plus, however, was probably the fact that you don't need to have 50 million ingredients to do the recipes."
5,Up late at night worrying about that next dinner party?,"Never do that again! This book will calm your troubled seas. From how to plan and organize to how to fold that napkin, it is all in here! No more white knuckles for me! Thanks Betty Crocker!"
5,Delicious recipes,"This book is designed for entertaining, and it does a good job of covering the basics involved with being a good host. The great thing is that the recipes are simple to make and they are delicious! I highly recommend this book for any kitchen."
3,Book,"I had seen this book at a library and wanted it badly, but it was too expensive, then I saw it on Amazon and I knew I could have it.It is more than a book, it is a how-to on entertaining and everyoneI know wants a copy."
3,"A good tee shirt, but not the older quality","I have purchased Jockey tee shirts for many years. I have usually been happy with the soft cotton and quality of the tee shirts. I have not purchased for a few years. I recently purchased from this ad. This new order is of a different variety. The cotton is not so soft and pliable. The sewing appears the same, but the quality of the cotton is much decreased. Apparently something has changed at Jockey regarding their quality considerations. These are good tee shirts, just not of the same quality as in the past and as I have been used to expect from Jockey."
2,Filled my rag bag,"These t-shirts were comfortable enough. But they all fell apart and became holy in the wash. The material was thin and of poor quality. I have some Hanes that I bought around the same time that have a much thicker, softer quality cotton and have held up beautifully. These Jockeys have made excellent rags though. Very absorbent."
3,A so-so product,These shirts are thinner than they used to be and just don't feel like they are 100% cotton. I'm sure they will hold up through many frequent launderings but I wanted something a little warmer for my husband who is in a nursing home.
2,This guy is mean!!,"I have read all three books in this trilogy. I started with Earth Song not knowing that it was a trilogy. Earth Song is #2 and it is very enjoyable. It is funny and it held my interest. Then I went to #1 and finally to #3 which is Fire Song. The main male characters..Roland in Secret Song and I can't remember the guys name in Fire Song...border on insane! They are so jealous and suspicious through the entire book. Well, to be fair, the last 10 pages they find they really love the lady...too late for me I guess. At one point Daria got so mad at Roland she knocked him down some stairs. I enjoyed reading that part because he deserved it. I love Catherine Coulter's writing but found myself getting mad reading this after the guys had called their ladies lying and deceitful one too many times!!"
3,GOOD BUT?,"I've read all of the songs and hey, they were pretty good but do these men have to be so cruel. Ok I can handle a little bit of cruelty to keep the story intesting {because ain't nothing worse that a man with no back bone} and hey, I like it ruff sometimes. It just seem likes these men are extreme. So in Ms. Coulters case the men get the chance at playing hard to get, or at least that's how I view it. The women however realize they love their men early on and want to be with them. In some cases I don't see how, {FIRESONG} He was an abuser and an adulter. There is no way I could have fallin for him."
2,Who turned the lights out!,"One star for the price and one star for the trashy film making,zero stars for everthing else,thats how I'm going to have to rate this package. If they could have cleaned these up a bit I would have given a five star rating. I liked the movies just not the visuals as the picture looked so bad in some scenes I couldn't see a thing. They were almost completly black. I don't mine a little bit of a grainy look. The Beat up film sometimes adds to the charm but this is just unwatchable in some parts. What a shame cuz they were pretty funny. I 'm glad I only paid 5 bucks other wise I would have returned it."
4,A worthwhile read,"As the title suggests, this book would be good as a second book in your go study. I tried part of the Elementary Go series after my first book (Iwamoto's), got a bit frustrated, and then went back and read this - and I'm glad I did finally get around to reading this book. I'll probably go back to the Elementary Go series after I finish Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go next.The chapters on capturing races were very good; these alone are worth the price of the book. I usually avoid rote memorization (EG, I find joseki study boring), but the six types of capturing races seemed quite worth committing to memory, so I did.(nearly?) every chapter has recommendations on books to read for further study of the subject covered by that chapter.If you're serious about go, I'd recommend something else as a first book (of course), but it'd be a good idea to make this your second - read concurrently with the first two volumes of Kano's ""Graded Go Problems for Beginners""."
5,One of the greatest books i've ever read on the bombing,"I'm 17 and i've read up on the Oklahoma city bombing ever since it happened April 19, 1995. So far this is one of the greatest books i've ever read on the bombing, and beleive me i've read alot of them. It gives you step by step accounts of Timothy Mcveighs life, his family, his years of service in the United States Army, and after his time in the gulf war when driffted away from his family and his government. I couldnt put this book down,i rarely read anything unless it has to do with the OKCB, survival or military combat and martial arts."
2,Research Not Accurate..,"This author has not personally researched much of the information about the individuals discussed in this book, with the exception of Timothy McVeigh. Much of the personal information of individuals presented in the book was obtained from previous news reports. Unfortunately,most of those were not accurate,either. As a family involved with the bombing and discussed in the book, we were greatly disappointed that another author has taken advantage of a national disaster for self-promotion and profit instead of providing accurate information on a tragedy. The author had the opportunity and access to have written a truly inspiring and prize-winning piece. What is presented instead is the work of an ""outsider"" exploiting personal tragedy, victory and the suffering of a nation in exchange for royalties."
3,Little new information other than the usual government line,"I took this book out of the public library for something to read about the Oklahoma City bombing while waiting for more of an expose. Serrano offers background information on McVeigh which helped to flesh out the man who most likely was involved in the bombing. What he offered as events of the bombing I found hard to believe considering that a Ret.Brig.Gen. Benton K. Partin submitted a report to Congress outlining his analysis of the blast after many years studying explosives and their effects on targets. Partin contends that in order for the damage to have occured to the Murrah building there would have to have been charges placed on the supporting girders in the basement. Serrano also omits his documentation,any footnotes,a bibliography or any other way of checking his sources. I felt like I was reading exactly what the government wanted me to believe."
3,I got more information out this book than the news.,I liked the fact that Mr. Serrano gave a lot of background information. There wasn't a lot that I knew about McVeigh until after reading this book. I began to understand more about what he might have been thinking. This book gave me a look inside of McVeigh's possible thoughts and gave me some understanding about why he might have bombed the building. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more than what they heard in the newspapers about the man who shocked the entire US. This book give a scary reality about what personal experiences can do to a person who appears to be normal all his or her life.
3,Okay,"Veronica is an older woman, who starts dating Kumi, a much younger guy. The couple first meets when Kumi stops to help Veronica fix a flat tire on the side of the road. For me the couple moved to fast, I guess because I'm more old fashion. The book was okay."
3,Excellent Photography Poorly Presented,"Chasing Silver has better than average photography, but drags in a lot of places and uses some inexperienced actors. I shared the video with a bunch of my fishing buddies and everyone enjoyed the material. However, there were frequent groans and russeling of ice cubes when the same sequences kept showing up episode after episode. There was also impatience when we learned that some of the main characters were nothing more than average guys with a tarpon addiction. The interviews with Billy Pate weren't anything special and a bit disappointing,given he is a legend in fly fishing circles. Good concept/ needs professional help."
4,episodes,"Not action packed, more like episodes, have to watch the men not only catch fish, but chat about it before hand and after the catch. kinda was tedious for me being a non enthusiast of tarpon."
5,great book,good insight to who we are in Christ...great to give as a gift or to keep at your bedside to re read whenever you need a reminding of who you are in HIM
5,learn from an expert!,"At the recent Sacred Dance Guild Lakeshore Chapter conference, Dancing the Light, I attended Deena's workshop based on Chapter 5 of her book, ""Getting Started."" It was excellent and so is the book. Deena shares her eighteen years of dancing in churches with us so that we might benefit from her experience. I particularly liked the idea of a mission statement for a liturgical dance group.The book is a wonderful combination of personal testimony, historical and scriptural context, and practical tips and choreography. Especially noteworthy is the brief history of liturgical dance summed up in two columns spanning the centuries: one for those who ""favor dance"" and one for those who ""oppose dance."" This is a continuing debate . . .If you're interested in starting a liturgical dance group or need tips for your current group, you'll find this book, written from Deena's perspective as a seminary-trained Lutheran and a ballet-trained dancer, a useful and inspiring read."
1,Ruined by environmental warning,"I sat through this meditation and found it quite enjoyable, planning to recommend it to child clients and have my son use it, until, at the end of the meditation, a wise, old ""merman"" leaves us with, ""Water is the life blood of Earth, and just as you need water to sustain yourself, so does the earth. When we pollute our oceans, we're polluting ourselves. So take care of the ocean. Take care of Your ocean."" The narrator then tells you that ""he leaves you to think about this as the scene fades."" That is the end of the meditation ---- thinking about how the ocean shouldn't be polluted. I find that to be quite an inappropriate use of a meditation. I consider myself a strong environmentalist, but I found my eyes snapping open when the old man spoke about pollution in this manner, just stuck on at the end as an advertisement."
3,Not for young children,"It is a nice CD, but according to other reviews it can be used with young children. I don't think so. The vocabulary used is meant to be used with children older than 12 years old. I don't think that the samples gave a good idea about the real tracks in the CD."
2,Pouches - not flat laminating sheets,"I ordered this product thinking it was standard laminating sheets. I was surprised when it arrived and turned out to be pouches, which I had to separate to use as I wanted. Perhaps I missed it, but I found no mention of ""pouches"" in the description. Also, it seemed to take an unusual amount of time to arrive, which I had not previously experienced from Amazon. I will continue to use Amazon, as I love the user-friendly site and usual prompt service."
2,Not Sheets,"There is some confusion between the product description and the product photo or graphic. In this case the photo said pouches and the description said sheets. The last time I ordered (a smaller box) it was the same - but the product was, in fact, sheets so I lucked out. This time, not so lucky - not sheets. I'm returning the box, but am hesitant to try again. BTW, Amazon makes it painless to return things. I'll give them another star for that alone!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I just recently started reading the books in the Magic the Gathering realm. What sparked an interest in reading the novels is that I am a long time player of the card game. So naturally being a big fan of the game I wanted to find out if the books offered any exciting background and/or origins of the characters, items and creatures that exist in the game. This novel being titled ""The Colors of Magic"", in my opinion failed to deliver any sense or explanation of the mystic powers that each color and its terrain represent. Even the stories that are to portray each color are dull and don't capture the true meaning of what each color denotes. Maybe all of this is coming from a player's perspective, but even for a fantasy novel it was a REAL SNOOZE."
4,"Some good, some clunkers. Overall, a very nice anthology.","Well, Magic keeps rolling down the highway of good books with its first ""Anthology Anthology"" (unlike the pitiful ""Rath and Storm""), known as ""The Colors of Magic."" My perticular favorite story was Jeff Grubb's ""Loran's Smile"", and Feldon's quest to get Loran back by any means possible. He gives everything, but he gains much more. The clunker was the story of Black Magic, which I read three times and still did not understand. It made me want to rip those pages out of the book, so poor was the short story. Overall: Read Red, White, and Gold. Do not read: Black. Everything else is vanilla."
2,Some good - Some bad.... overall not worth reading,"This anthology, like many anthology books, is filled with various stories that are both good and bad. One big problem I had with the anthology on a whole was there was only one black story - and it was awful. While the other colors had two or three stories to balance out the different styles of play and effect the various colors could incorporate the color black was left with a very poor story. It was absolutely hideous. I can only hope the other books by Vance Moore (the author of the black story) in the magic series are a billion times better.While my favorites were the red and white stories (white being my favorite overall) and they were worth reading, the others were only mediocre at best, and black being, well you've read the above paragraph.Decent anthology, but not worth it to read it. I would've much rather have started the ice age cycle instead of delving into these stories that were not worth the time."
2,An unappealing hot sauce,"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being a hot sauce that I find to be unappealing. Awhile back, I had tried this hot sauce, but I could not remember what I had thought about it. So recently, I decided to get another bottle of it in order to give it another try. When I tried it, my impression was that it was strong and sharp, yet it did not have a pleasant taste. Also, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like, but I do not consider this to be a problem--it is not overpoweringly hot. I am glad that I gave this hot sauce another shot, but it just is not my thing."
1,Don't Bother,"This is something you can pick up at wal-mart for 98 cents (I have, unfortunately). It's hotter than most generic hot sauces, but the taste is terrible. It smells like olives (somehow), and gets in the way of the flavor of the food you're putting it on."
1,Sharp Organizer,"Instead of improving the Sharp Organizer with new technology, this product cannot hold a candle to its predecessors. Earlier generations had greater capacity, durability, ease of use, and reliability. The programming for this product is inflexible, the data capacity is ridiculously low, it is physically flimsy and actually I went straight to the wastebasket with it. A total waste of money."
1,Not great,I am disappointed by this product. Half the time the contacts that I know are in the unit do not show up. Sometimes they do. I do not trust it and am back to the old card rollodex.
1,Sharp EL-6930,"This organizer is very old and in lieu of a smart phone or other modern device a waste of money. You cannot transfer data, nor will it accept more than a single line of data in the telephone mode."
1,Doesn't do the job,"The screen is dim and letters and symbols are difficult to read because they're too broken up. Additionally, the unit is flimsy and the clock feature didn't work. It is poor in every respect compared to the Sharp Wizard, which is no longer made. I hope it will be accepted for return.Update: The seller will accept a return with a 20% ""restocking fee"" because it was opened, (it obviously must be opened before one can see that its screen is dim and letters hard to read), and I pay return shipping, which makes returniing not worth it economically. I've never had a problem with an ""Amazon"" return and will limit purchases to that from now on."
4,great item ...for the price,I have been a sharp 'fan' forever and this organizer is one of the best for its price.
4,NOTHINGS PERFECT...THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING MISSING,"I've bought this Sony laptop because of the brand itself. All of my products in my house are SONY. I never had any problems. Plus, the special rebate offer on this one. I could have given this product 5 stars but it lacks some of the essential parts of it. It lacks all the backup cds. Like: audio & video drivers and this laptop has already a pre-installed Windows Vista, but lacks its CD :( The drivers you can download at Sony's website, but getting the Windows Vista...you can't. So, I think Sony needs to improve their marketing on this laptop. This is the first time I've encountered a company who sells computers who doesn't include backup drivers. Overall 4 out of 5 stars."
2,tv out doesnt work,"its one week and my CD\DVD drive is not working.But the real problem is that the super video TV out online give black and white imagen. I can assure you that i am not doing anything wrong and its not a standard issue, it is not working properly.The other real rare thing is that in Sony's support website this model is not listed, really, you wont find this model for support. Its like it doesnt exist. And the email support they gave me, sucks.It came with out any back up CD. Not drivers, restore or Windows vista.the rest its ok, its really pretty."
4,"Misleading title, but still worth watching.","I recently purchased this DVD at Target for $2.00. When I picked it up (with several other Echo Bridge 3 - 4 Movie titles) I was not expecting much. But then again when you are paying less than you would on Amazon.com it is still a great deal. While most of the DVDs I purchased were only worth 1 watching, this DVD was different. It includes several stories related to Vietnam and other recent wars (nothing on Afghanistan or Iraq though). The storytelling, interviews, and dramatizations is excellent. Definitely worth the purchase if you can get it cheap enough."
5,Shedding light on an unknown ritual.,"I read Dignity Beyond Death soon after my mother died. It was comforting to know that her final journey in this life was met with the caring, sensitive and meaningful ritual of Tahara.The dignity and spirituality of the process was in keeping with how she lived her life. Rochel Berman has given us a gift by sharing with us the world of Tahara where the final act of kindness occurs from one human being to another."
2,Hangs/overheats,"I replaced my old Sonicwall SOHO/10 firewall with the TZ 170 in December of 2004. I used it for 3 years. The most annoying aspect of this unit is that it would just hang and require a power cycle. Early on this happened about once every other month and towards the end it was happening monthly. The unit ran very hot and seemed to require some time to cool down before it would recover. Even then, sometimes it took multiple power cycles to have the unit start."
2,Slash is it.,"Usually I'm always looking for new genres of Slash, BL and Yaoi, and this was one of the titles I picked up. Sure there's slash potential but not enough to satisfy the Yaoi Fans hunger (like Gorgeous Carat or Descendants of Darkness) so if you're a Yaoi fan looking for slash, this is not the title to pick up!"
5,They work fine,I use these for spraying watercolor paint or water. They work just right. And the price is a good one.
1,Piece of Garbage,"I understand this is a small plastic bottle with a short life span, but it broke on the 2nd pump. Don't buy it. It's obvious the manufacturer does not care about quality."
1,FastPaced For Its Time,"Renfrwew of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was the hero of several films of the time. Although a Mountie, his adventures were not restricted to the usual Jack Londonish idea of the Yukon. Renfrew was a modern for his time hero, in this film, trying to track down a killer.Renfrew was a Singing Mountie, so in addition to fights and chases, he gets to burst into song during the course of the story.By current standards, this would be classifird as a family film."
3,"Won't Splash, But Difficult to Clean","I have two large dogs who are messy when they eat and drink, so this product seemed a great idea to me. The bowls definitely work as far as keeping the water from splashing over; however, it is impossible to empty them of old water completely because the rim is curved under. I put them in the dishwasher but am always left with standing water. The bowls do perform as they claim, but I probably wouldn't buy these again because of the difficulty cleaning them."
1,My least favorite Parr book. Not one for the collection.,"I have to say that after obtaining every Parr book I can get my hands on, I have been pleased with all of them and kept every one in my collection, except this one. I completely have no interest in people hurrying to France to stock up on booze because there is no tax. I feel it is his worst book, and apart from a few decent shots of people in line in a supermarket, there aren't any standout photos here. Definitely not his best work."
1,Skip it,"I'll admit that I and my e-mail correspondants have been duped by some of the urban legends contained in this book. However, the book's title is misleading. Most of these stories are campfire stories and jokes that no reasonably intelligent person believes happend to ""a friend of a friend.""Those looking for an easy quick read of a mildly entertaing book should order it. Unless you fall into that category, I fear you will, like I did, regret paying for a book such as this when there are so many urban legend websites available with a double-click as the only payment needed."
5,An enticing page-turner!,"So much has been made of so-called urban legends in the recent past . . . in movies, newsmagazines, as fodder for talk shows. But it wasn't until I picked up this jewel of a book that I felt I could converse like a pro about them! First-rate writing, crackerjack research . . . bravo!"
5,Definately entertaining,"I thought this book wasted no paper with an analysis of each legend.If you want fascinating stories ,you have over 200 in this book.Other books ressemble humanaties text ,which have you skipping through dozens of boring pages to get to the stories themselves.Alligators in the sewer, really had what I wanted -lots of urban legends,in one book."
3,"Entertaining but very loose definition of ""urban legend""","This is an entertaining book (and probably another good bathroom book), though I was occasionally nonplussed at what was considered an urban legend. It of course contains the familiar stories: alligators in New York sewers, people waking up in their hotel rooms sans kidneys, the poodle in the microwave, etc. Other stories included are actually true: the guy who attaches balloons to his lawn chair (there are news articles online about this), the person who trains pigeons to congregate in response to a referee's whistle. (The latter I heard from an MIT student whom I have no reason to distrust.)Still others partake more of the horror-story-around-a-campfire than the usual urban legend, i.e., there seems to be no real reason to believe the story.But it's entertaining (and easy) reading nonetheless--a lot of fun."
5,Excellent!,"This was a very good book. Alreday in the first few chapters, we are brought into the war in cleansing the lands of silvanesti. The book then took on a good pace to tell about the conflicts about the Knights of Takhisis and the elves of Qualinesti. The only thing that i would like to know more about in this story is the ending and about Porthios. This book is REALLY good and i recommend it to all DragonLance fans."
5,"For a book that is not about Raistlin, it's really good","To be honest, wasn't expecting much from this book. I only read it because I was hoping for more info about how Qualinesti handeled the Choas War. I was really inpressed. The plot is excellent, and apparently, I was the only one who liked the characters. Gilthnas was surprisingly well written, but I would have liked to see more emotion in him. I really like the parts about Gilthnas and his Kagonesti wife. I reccommend this book to everyone."
3,More a Question than a review,"I too am a left handed designer. Here is my problem. When I write or draw, my paper is at a 45 degree angle. Meaning that that page is flat on the surface, but I tilt it almost sideways so the lines are diagonal to write or draw. The previous pads I had could not accommodate this and working with then was beyond frustrating. Does this new tablet function if it is placed at a diagonal slant?Thank you."
2,Great mouse alternative that hogs memory,"This tablet replaced a Graphire3 that replaced a rollerball mouse that replaced a wireless optical mouse that replaced a corded mouse...all in an attempt to find somthing more comfortable to use over extended uses.The Graphire3 was great but the pen is terribly uncomfortable for someone my size...it's tiny and clearly made for smaller hands. I'm just 6', so I don't need somthing abnormally large, but the Intuos pen shows Wacom knows how to make a comfortable pen if you're willing to pay for it.And with that ultra-comfortable pen, I looked forward to using this tablet. It's great...except for the amazing amount of memory the drivers demand. There was a noticeable performance lag immediately after installing the new drivers despite my dual 1ghz G4 processors. When I finally had had enough of sluggish performance and unistalled the software before return, my CPU sped right back up. Something to keep in mind."
2,"Bland, uninformative, dull","Carpenter tries hard and covers all the bases, but the book gives us very little idea what exactly made Tolkien tick and what he was trying to say with Lord of the Rings, especially the powerful concluding chapters. This was a disappointment"
3,bland and uninformative,"carpenter tries hard and covers all the bases, but the book gives us very little idea what exactly made tolkien tick and what he was trying to say with lord of the rings. a disappointment"
2,Complete missunderstanding of the life of Tolkien,"The book is very interesting, but just because it deals with the life of an extremely interesting person, not because of its quality, insight or information.I am specialy angry with one comment that the author did: he says that the Tolkien world is essentially a Christian world. This is absolutely false!!! Can't you see, Mr. Carpenter, that the world set up by Tolkien is based on Nordic pre-christian religions???!!! The source for all his mythology and characterization are germanic and anglo-saxon sources (Beowulf, Sagas, etc) Tolkien has more to do with a heroic Saga-like world than with a humble Christian one."
1,Beware the side effects!,"Took this supplement to help with the blues and mild arthritis, since I am above average weight, I started at 800 mg per day, which I increased over a month to 1600 mg since I noticed no effect. I even tried 2 brands.The one thing that I did notice was VERY severe lower abdominal pain that occured about 4 hours after each dose. Sometimes I could relieve some of the pain with antacids/simethicone or going to the bathroom, but it was very bothersome. After about 2 months of use and no noticeable positive effects and increasing abdominal discomfort, had to discontinue use.After 4 days off the SAMe, gut pain is gone and no withdrawls, just left with a lesson of pain and expense that was unsatisfactory.I recommend you go to yoga, meditate or seek therapy if you have the blues and do not take this poisonous, useless product."
5,Excellent!,This is an excellent book. I have read it several times. Dr. Taylor helps you understand how to see what stress does and what you can do to help yourself!!! Awesome book and awesome doc!!!
