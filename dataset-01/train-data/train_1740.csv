5,Great for any listener.,"There aren't many albums that I would rate over Southernunderground. For the complete package of beats, lyrics, MC chemistry, and fun this is definitely your best choice. Kopp it!"
5,Slobbalina Gromper,"This album no does Whacks! This also GREAT like ""Will Rap for Food""!!! Each time I have listens to this I very excited for make rhyme rapping. These are best excellent!!!"
5,2003's Best Album,"Southernunderground is one of those albums that you can play front to back, and not want to skip a song. Each song blends into the next song so perfectly, you really wonder why CL doesn't get much more shine. Kno, Deacon, and Mr. SOS work together perfectly and make Southernunderground one of the greatest CDs ever. Also look at Will Rap For Food, which is equally as good as SU.Yodel."
2,My First Try as Reviewer,"Didn't care for the title of the book...eye catching, but denagrading to both Jews and African-Americans.Found the book too much of a review of the author's life versus an overview of the Jewish assimilation experience in America."
1,Unsupported and invalid,"This is quite possibly the worst piece of scholarship that I have read in this field. The central conceit of the book involves an error of self-persuasion: namely, that the author's own vicissitudes over racial issues in the post-60s decades are historically reflected in some empirical fashion in the history of Jewish people in American society. The insights that the author has lifted from other books are of the cut-and-paste variety rather than a serious rethinking and analysis."
1,Junk,This book may be the most unreadable piece of junk I have ever come across. This book has very little to say and says it poorly. The best part of the book is the title. It is totally downhill from there.
1,Horrible,"This book is terrible, not organized chronologically nor regionally. No questions to guide note taking, much superfluous information, and just a bad book altogether. I would be surprised at anyone who isn't feeling suicidal while going through the 35 chapters."
1,i never thought i could be this bored,"""kill me....kill mee....every moment i live is agony."" that, ladies and gentlemen, is what one feels when reading THE EARTH AND ITS PEOPLES. From one parching paragraph to the next through over 900 pages of ennui,dreading every page of text more than the last,eagerly anticipating the end of each assigned reading, one begins to wonder,""what on earth made me sign up for AP world history?"""
1,Ack!,"For an AP world high school class textbook, the chapters are supersaturated with information, with no distinction as to what is important and what isn't thus when outlining chapters one is forced to have outlines almost as long as the chapter since there is no distinction of importance in the information. Each chapter is very long and there is continual jumping from time and culture. In addition, much of the writing is stretched out when it shouldn't be. It is not concise or pithy but pretentiously blown out. In short, it is boring, unclear, nonlinear, disorganized, too long. Get anything else but this."
1,Not a good book,"Ok, since I am completely insane, I decided to take AP World History. Bad idea. Not only does the course suck, but I am forced to outline this stupid book.Flaws:The text is broken by pages of primary documents that are more boring than the book itselfThe book bores me and everyone else who reads itFor some reason, they decide they have to put a cover on this book depicting ""foreign people."" Who gives a darn? Its just a cover!This book was obviously made so that techers and school boards love it, not the kids who have to read it. Do yourself a favor: if anyone reading this is considering buying or using this book, don't.It only causes pain."
2,Boring Text,"I am currently using this book for an Advanced Placement World History class. To cover the book in the amount of time given (a typical high school year) my class is expected to read one chapter (normally 20-30 pages) each weekend. I must say that I dread this assignment. The text is very boring to read with very few interesting parts. It often uses unnecessary ""flowery"" language to explain something on one or two pages that should only take three or four paragraphs. I will admit that the book has very good information, but if you plan to learn world history by reading a book chapter by chapter, rather than skimming and studying important parts, skip this book if at all possible."
1,Junk that doesn't work,"This is a lousy toy. The unit itself is too slow to register when someone gets a hit, so its useless. Don't buy."
5,just what i wanted,Fast shipping too I got it for Halloween with pur pee cameo pants. It is a nice fabric not cheap material either. Great price
1,Just a copy of great movies,"I remember watch a few years ago some movie (don't ask me the name) about mutants, it was something like X-Men before Bryan Singer make his versi√≥n of the comic, and it was good, even when later arrive the mentioned X-men, because it was a unique vision about this theme.With this introducction I'm telling, al leat to me ther'e no reason to take some ideas from other people when you try to do something of your own kind, with your own languaje, but in the case of this move all it's like a copy of every single fantasy american movie. Just like shakira, all the people claim about his work as something wonderfull not thinking about how she take all what she is from other people, in this case you can find reference from The lord of the rings, blade, ghostbuster, hellboy, buffy and much more, what it's worst there so many violent sequences don't fit with the story. At the end, any message is lost thanks the brainless action, not even something fun."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I just bought this movie and already it's in the garbage. I wouldn't even try to sell it to anyone. i look at is as a bad movie I've seen in the theaters or something. I saw clips of this movie while watching another movie. I was so excited to watch it because the previews looked good. Damn, I was wrong big time!!!! this movie sucked badly. The dailog was hard to understand and the story line was all over the place. You didn't know who was suppose to be bad and who was suppose to be good. My advice and if I were you, I would listen. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME...IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worst of the Worst,"I can't believe I spent my $25 Amazon coupon on this drivel. After reading the reviews I thought this might be a good addition to our growing collection of DVDs. NOT!!!! My dh and I have voted this the WORST movie of all time. ""The Night of the Lupus"" was our old worst. How can I return this disaster?"
5,wow,this and day watch are both from Russia with an American movie company you can change the language track from Russian to English. i love this so much. you got to check it out.
3,A Russian Vampire movie,"The eternal war of the Dark against the Light is fought bythe ""others"". One of the others is tricked into betraying his only child to the Dark.A very bloody movie with very strange special effects,more like a western sword and sorcery than science fiction.For an atheistic 'Communist' culture such a movie must of been forbidden.The times are really changing and they really don't have any prieststo appeal to to drive out evil spirits.Here a victory for the Dark side is recorded:I suppose we can blame this of Ronald Reagen?"
4,"Love the movie, hate the En doubling","Not the greatest movie of all time but I love it anyways. Only problem is that the product description is inaccurate. I wanted the original film in its entirety, i.e., as it was released in Russia, with optional En subtitles. This version has the subtitle option but anytime the narrator speaks, the voice is in English. I'm sure this won't bother most people but it is unbelievably irritating to me. Would have been nice if the distributors had included this linguistic hiccup in the packaging information. Still - an awesome, ridiculous movie. (Same review for Day Watch)"
3,Is Night Watch Worth Watching?,"Night Watch is the type of movie you'll watch and then want more and when you get more (in the form of Day Watch), you'll regret wanting it. And that's the problem -- Night Watch has some great ideas that are executed, for the most part, flawlessly. The movie isn't as action-packed as some would suggest, but there's enough fuel to keep the plot moving. On the other hand, the story has too much and plays like a multi-faceted novel instead of a movie. The ending is open-ended, but the main story continues in Day Watch, which is unfortunate because while Day Watch maintains the momentum of its predecessor, it falls apart at its cop-out ending.So can Night Watch be recommended even though it's the first of two and the second sucks? No. I can't recommend it. On its own, it'll leave you wanting a sequel, which a good movie should do, but it still should be self-contained, which Night Watch isn't.Watch at the risk of your disappointment."
3,OK vampire flick,Just ok. The story was fair. The actors were ok. The special effects were a but campy at times. Lower your expectations a little and you'll be fine.
3,It's worth renting not buying.,"To some extent, this movive will satisfy horror fans' thirst for something different. Its strength lies in two areas: the plot and the style of the filming.I have never seen this plot before. It was filmed in Russian style;therefore it kept me wondering what would happened next most of the time.Some of the scenes are startling. Its special effects are on par with those of American-made B movies.I'm glad I rented it."
3,Visually Stunning Enough to keep you interested,"Night Watch is a great looking film with vampires and other creatures of the night. It's hard to follow though and is occasionally silly and confusing. Hopefully the next film Day Watch is better made and easier to follow. I found the characters interesting though and the direction is stylish but possibly overly stylish. I mean the film is so flashy with so much going on that it can be distracting. Plus the end is kind of stupid and laughable. The story is creative and occasionally creepy and has the potential to be way better than the Underword films. It could be a great film even, if it wasn't so strangely made and weird that is."
4,Great,Well I don't want to go into details about the movie but it was really great.It would be great for everyone to watch this movie.
2,Hmmmm,"After hearing many people praise this film, I had high hopes for a good movie along the lines of the original Highlander. Instead I came away confused and disappointed. The plot was just too disjointed, the characters not terribly compelling and their actions just plain nonsensical, and the conclusion disappointing. Just sad that the storyline held such promise."
1,Campy,"Cover looks promising, but wasn't. I can do campy horror flicks, but if I have to read subtitles along with the bad acting then it's just too much work to enjoy it. Cool idea, bad delivery."
2,Box description,"I made sure to read the descriprion before I buy. This one said there is russian language, but when we turned it one and went to settings there was spanish, french and english, BUT NO RUSSIAN !Vere disappointing."
4,Unique movie!,"This is a different film than what I had expected. Despite it not reaching all my expectations, I enjoyed the film till the very end!"
3,So so movie... cool bluray,"This movie is ok. If you are really bored, then watching this movie would be awesome. Since I wasn't so bored, it was just okay. The only reason I bought this movie was because Hollywood movies are getting lousy. Anyway, this movie is way better than most hollywood movies these days. I would go as far as saying it's better than the previous James Bond movie (I consider JB a hollywood movie). By the way, if you are getting this, also buy Day Watch. It's the sequel."
3,"Interesting idea, good effects, awful subtitles and dubbing.","After watching this movie I scratched my head wondering if I had missed something.While the story and twist at the end make the film worthwile to watch, the plot holes and sketchy characters dont give the film any depth. Hey, didnt that power station blow up?I watched the movie in English with English subtitles and the difference between the two was confusing. While the dubbing is better, I wonder if Fox got the Russian to English right?A valient effort on the part of the Russian Cinema."
2,poor film... not an EPIC...,"guys, if an epic film is just showing a 5 minute scene of battle... it does not mean that it is an EPIC film... besides it's far away from LORD OF THE RINGS!!!!it's no scary...has some few little special effects...is not that gory...i mean... it's fine for a limited release... but i just didnt find this movie cool at all!! nor entreteining!!!PS.. is it really 114 minutes?? i added the scenes minutes and it's much less than that... that's just wierd!!well see u guys around!"
2,A big yawn,"Literally! I fell asleep.From the first 10-15 miinutes, the ideas and action seemed really interesting, but then it was just a drag with little actually happening worth watching at all, with the exception of the vampire fight using light and mirrors. Yep, if you want a bang for your buck, you'll have to look elsewhere as this is little more than a whimper! And this is the first of a triology?! Don't know what the book's like - well, I don't speak Russian!- but whether through lack of money, or lack of vision, it just didn't translate to the screen at all. Very disappointing."
1,NIGHT BOREDOM,"This movie sucks. If I could give it a 1/2 star I would. I wasted 2 hours watching this movie and still can't figuire out the plot. What a waste of ten dollars. DO NOT get this movie, even if it was free. For those of you that gave this movie a good rating....what movie were you watching?"
5,Watch the Russian cut instead,"This is the first time I have been inspired to write an Amazon review. I finally bought the U.S. release of Nochnoy dozor, which has turned out to be one of my most favorite movies. However I was very upset to find that this release is completely different than the original Russian version. The U.S. version of Night Watch is a bit hard to follow. The explanation of Others and the Great Battle at the beginning was excellent, but it quickly goes downhill when scenes are inserted that throw the movie totally off course. There's very little of the dark humor that was shown in the Russian cut, and what happened to Ignat?The U.S. release portrays Night Watch to be some sort of unfeeling, straight action movie in the vein of Underworld. Anyone wishing to experience the full effect of Night Watch should do themselves a favor by getting the original version."
3,WHERE ARE THE ANIMATED SUBTITLES ON BLU RAY!!!,Movie- 5 starsThe only reason I'm giving this a three is because the Blu Ray does not come with the animated subtitles. The subtitles on the DVD added such a great element to the film! I miss them oh so much and am quite upset that the Blu Ray does not utilize them!
3,"Enjoyed the book, not the movie.","I'm writing this review for all the ones that enjoyed the book like me and want to see the movie.It's absolutely different, the story line is changed, and all the great scenes the book had are not in the movie...........very disappointing.At least you get to understand whats happening........but if it weren't for the book I guess most people seeing the movie alone will be VERY confused.........I do not recommend it to people who loved the book, I at least will continue to read these novels only."
4,Spectacular special effects,"I wish I hadn't had to read subtitles during this movie. I think it lost something in the translation, and made the movie seem a bit too long. Plus, reading means you can miss some of the stunning visual effects.This film ads so much to a much overused/badly used genre: vampire movies. Sci-Fi geeks rejoice, and see it. I promise you won't be disappointed."
4,A rich and visually interesting story,"If you only saw this movie in the theater, you need to check it out on DVD. There is enough detail and on-screen gems that one pass in the theater just doesn't do it justice. Get the DVD and watch it at home when you can pause at will. It really is a good movie and I am definately looking forward to the next one."
5,Allegorical fantasy,"There's a feel to this movie that is lacking in most Hollywood productions. It's certainly not as clean or as refined as some of the products the US movie industry puts out. However, the gritty ""unpolished"" nature of the film does not detract from the story. Rather, it lends an air of authenticity.The movie combines elements of morality and religion. Sacrifice, betrayal, love, and hope are all presented. Unlike most of Hollywood's creations, the ending is not what was expected (or could be expected)."
3,Rashin hoorroor feelm,Eez like dayvatch but eez night instead! Not great but not bad either. Some good effects. You buy it you buy it! LOL
1,Utterly confusing,"Ok, I am Russian and I watched this in Russian, not dubbed, and I swear this was the most confusing film I've ever seen. I was actually intrigued by it after seeing so many good reviews. But no matter how hard I tried to pay attention and to figure out what the heck was going on, I was completly lost. Maybe on another viewing I could have 'got it'. However, I wasn't even interested in what I saw the first time around and I could never picture myself actually watching that again. My husband agreed too. I don't normally give up so easily on a film I didn't understand, but all I saw was a visually cool, but messed up film."
2,"Okay, so ignore my rating of two stars!!!!",I gave this rating not realizing the russian audio with english subtitles was on side B. Great movie!!!!
2,"Bloody, dark","Too much blood in this movie, darkness, vampires, though it is set in conteporary Moscow. A bit much to stomach."
2,Not that great.,"Night Watch has a very interesting story and characters but the movie makers didn't put it well together. There are a bunch of different stories in the movie that have no connection like the damned lady, the vampiress, the young boy.....the movie is hard to follow.It's a half-decent movie that could have been better like others here said before. It manipulated me into wanting to see the second movie in the trilogy with a cliffhanger ending, but I think I'll wait till they come in DVD."
4,Damn cool,"I wasn't really sure what I expected from a Russian movie, but this was way more than I thought it would be. The cinematography and special effects looked like a big-budget Hollywood production, with a great plot and rockin sound track. Yes, it is sub-titled, but I have never seen sub-titles done like this, if anything they add to the movie rather than subtract from it, interacting with what's happening on screen. This is the kind of things they do, stuff in the foreground will cover them, or they'll blow away like smoke, or sometimes they're red and will dissolve like blood in water. I guess my best recomendation is that I'm already downloading Day Watch cause I can't wait to see what happens next."
5,one of the best books ever,if this is your subject of interest and you don't already own this book....GO BUY IT ALREADY!!! A true walk back in time to an era many remember but few participated in. Learn your history. Pay your dues and show some respect.
1,A poor effort,"A glorified attempt that falls way short of the mark. Boring design. It looks like a kid slapped this together in a photo album bought at Thrifty. Some of the color photos are good but I didn't get the feel of the intensity that goes hand in hand with this art form. Also, too many photos of smiling graffiti kids posing for the camera. If you like cheap exploitation at its best then buy this book."
1,this product is defective,I would recomend over looking anything by westpoint home. I bought two of the units and less than 2 weeks after putting them on the beds. Both are not working. I ordered these for cooler weather and now its here and my kids have no electric blankets and I have lost the money I have tied up in it.And no money to buy more. Buy at your own risk. Wish someone had told me this before I bought them.
2,Great while it lasts,"Like the above reviews, I LOVED this blanket. So much so that when it broke the first time (after 30 days), I packed it up and shipped it back to the manufacturer who replaced it (under warranty). It was so soft and pretty that I purchased an additional one for our guest room. That one broke too. Today, the one that was replaced has stopped working on my side. At least it lasted a few months this time. Same thing every time - controller just stops working - blinks E and a number. And there's NOTHING you can do to fix it other than replace it. Too much hassle. I'm very disappointed, but 3 strikes, you're out."
1,don't buy this blanket,"The fabric is really soft, the color is beautiful (blue), but only one controller worked. The other gave error #3 right from the start. Based on the one controller that was working - I had to start at level 7 and this was in a room where the ambient temperature was in the low 60s. Not a good sign. I will not buy this brand again."
1,Poor quality controller,"Burgundy Sleepwarmer Automatic Blanket - QueenWhat a disappointment! Brrrrr! Plugged it in for the first time and received an error code E 3 on one of the controllers. The instructions do not tell you why this happens. Tried everything. Laid the blanket flat, reconnected all controllers, then plugged them in. There it goes again, error code E 3. The only option given the consumer is to ""return the complete blanket system for service."" Doesn't keep me warm while in a shipping box enroute to or from North Carolina. If you want to be warm tonight, DON'T BUY this product!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"This is a horrible product. The first one arrived inoperable. The second one I used about half a dozen times, when I started getting error messages and it stopped working. For the price, you expect better quality. DO NOT waste your money on this product - find another electric blanket."
1,Unreliable product,"I received this blanket as a present in 2007. Loved the soft plush feel and the boost. Last year one side stopped heating and displayed the E4 error code. I could do with only one side, but this year the other side went out also...displaying the same error code. Unfortunately, no one has a receipt. In my opinion, this product is too pricey to have so many complaints. Said to have been purchased through JC Penney. Does anyone know of a reliable brand?"
1,SHUDDA LISTENED,I read many other reviews stating that this blanket DOES NOT WORK!Shudda listened cuz it DON'T!
1,Will Break!,"I spent quite a bit of money on this blanket for my wife for valentines day, only to have her controller break three days after we got it. After getting online and looking at reviews for this blanket, it turns out everyone is having the same problem. It's the most comfortable and amazing electric blanket i have ever seen, just be prepared to have break almost immediately."
4,worked great the first month but then . .,"first off, i love this blanket! IT IS SO SNUGGLY SOFT!! and i love the colour too. but after using it for two months, one of the controllers starting flasing ""E"" and then that side (my side) stopped warming up. I'd like to get it repaired if i could figure out where to send it. so in sum, great blanket and hold on to the paperwork in case you need to get yours repaired too. it is a very soft nice blanket"
1,ACOFFEY,"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN... YOUR PRODUCT SUCKS. I WOULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS GIVEN THE CHOICE. THIS $95.00 BLANKET LASTED ABOUT AS LONG AS IT TOOK TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE PACKAGE IT WAS WRAPPED IN. I WOULD NOT RECCOMMEND THIS ""HEATING BLANKET POSER"" EVEN IF IT WAS FREE. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY AND SHIPING COST TO ME! IF ANYONE OUT THERE WOULD LIKE TO TRY MY BROKEN BLANKET JUST SEND ME AN EMAIL, I WILL SAVE YOU $90 BUCKS. respectfully yours -ACOFFEY"
2,disapointed buyer,I received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed--it is just not warm enough!! Even on the highest setting it doesn't get warm enough initially. It is fine for keeping warm during the night but I want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does. It is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well. Not worth the money at all.
2,Stopped working,"This electric blanket has the nicest texture of the last ""five"" electric blankets we have purchased. However it stopped working within a month, like the other four. Who makes a realiable electric blanket? Not Sunbeam and not this brand. Since the texture on this one is nice, we can at least keep it as an extra cuddling blanket."
1,Bad controls,"The blanket worked, for 3 weeks. Now the controller just keeps blinking E. It wont reset, it wont warm. I cannot return it to amazon, It's been longer than 30 days, as I purchased it ahead of time as a christmas gift. I wont do that again."
1,Not worth the risk,"I read through all of the reviews, and they seemed mixed. I bought the blanket thinking it was a risk, but the price made it worth a try. The blanket is very soft, and beautiful -but never got warm.I returned the blanklet to Amazon, and received a refund."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BLANKET,"If you have plenty of time and money to send for an item, and then send it back because it is defective, then you should buy this blanket. I do not know why a company like Amazon continues to sell an item that is so obviously defective. A bad item reflects poorly on the entire website. Just like all the others that had problems with the controler, I also had the Error/3 message. Just take them off the site is my advise. What a waste of time!! (I should have read the reviews BEFORE I bought)"
1,Don't believe them when they say it great!!!,"I've purchased 4 of these (from Penney's) (they don't have a place to rate this product) trying to get ONE that worked longer than a couple of weeks. I have been very careful with each of them and everyone gives an error message of E3. I contacted the manufacurer and after about a month I finally received a reply that said, if it was E3 it was in the controller. That makes no sense, because if I switch the one side that does work over to the bad side it reads E3 also. If you want a very soft blanket for $150 with wires runing through it, that won't work, then this is the blanket for you. If not, just go out and buy a regular soft blanket for much less money and much less hassle! I finally purchased another brand and so far it is working fine although it is acrylic and isn't nearly as soft. DO NOT BUY THIS MARTEX BLANKET!!!!! It's a shame, because it is sooo soft!!!"
1,The infamous E4 error,"Same as many others - worked for about a week, then got the E4 error. The controller gives a soft but audible click inside when you turn it on, and the display toggles between 'E' and '4'. The on/off button does not turn the controller off at this point. Checked all connections, wiring, etc. but nothing helped.The blanket itself is very soft, but even at the highest setting it never got very hot. A very disappointing purchase."
2,Good for maybe a year (if you're lucky),"This blanket (king) worked real well until the blanket (not controller) quit working on one side. I think most of these reviews think the controller is malfunctioning, but I plugged the controller into the other side of the blanket and it worked. Anyway, avoid this blanket (brand). Try something else, I have purchased a Sunbeam from Amazon. Hopefully I'll get a good one."
1,Bad product!!!!,"I had four of these blankets during the period they were ordered. None on them worked and they were all returned for credit. I ordered the first one and only one side worked. This was returned and another blanket received. This one worked for only a week and stopped. I returned it for credit. In the meantime, I had ordered one for my son for his birthday. Only one side of this one worked. (Both blankets had a defective right side.) This was returned and a replacement sent. The replacement did not work and it was returned for credit.I would not order this same blanket under any circumstances."
1,Westpoint home blankets terrible,"I've seen so many bad reviews on these products which fall under several different names, Westpoint Home, Martex, but wantd to put in my two cent. After using this for a few weeks, it errored out with E4 (plugged into the blanket) and an E1 unplugged. No amount of trying to reset it would work. JC Penny purchase."
4,We Love Our Sleepwarmer,We purchased this Electric Blanket based on our many years of experience with similar products. The price was very competitive and it met our expectations - particularly regarding the relatively inobtrusive nature of the electric wiring and fabric softness. It's too new for us to rate its durability.
2,Electric blanket,Original blanket received proved defective. When plugged in the controller was always in error code mode. Reported this to Amazon and was promptly shipped a replacement with free shipment back of defective item. So far replacement works just fine.
1,Not one but TWO were defective,"I had one that was great for a couple of months, then started blinking ""E"" and some error number. Got it replaced. Now after a couple more months, the replacement started blinking ""E"" and ""3"" (the E3 error that others have reported). Will return it again. What a piece of junk, and for such a high price!"
1,Very Sad.,"My mom bought two of these blankets, one for me and one for my sister. My sister's blanket stopped working within days. It flashed E and then a number. Mine stopped working about 2 months later, flashing E and 4. I exchanged mine and she returned hers. It has been about 10 months since I exchanged my blanket for a new one, and now the new is flashing E-4 on both sides. I'm so upset because when the blanket works I absolutely love it. However I no longer have the receipt and in order to return it, I have to pay about $50 in shipping costs... This is definately not worth the trouble nor the money."
1,This electric blanket is junk,"I bought one of these electric blankets and it didn't seem to get very warm so I returned it for another. Had the same problem with the second one so I called customer service and they told me that I should try a different color. The color I bought may have been a ""bad batch."" I tried a different color and after two days I got an error message (E4), which translates to ""return the blanket and controller to the company."" At this point there is nothing the company can do to satisfy me. Just like baseball - three strikes and you're out. I'll just put a second comforter on the bed."
2,No Good,"It's really soft and fluffy, however, the heating part stopped working without much use. Same E-4 error code that I see posted all over these reviews. Not a recommended buy, for sure!"
3,Check the Warranty - Breaks Often,"I got this blanket in December 2006. The first one was defective immediately and exchanged with Amazon.com . Since I have had the blankets break 4+ times.HOWEVER This blanket does have a 5 year warrenty. Initially the company will ask you to ship it back (which cost me about $20) and they shipped me a new one. Later I asked them for RMAs if they wanted their blanket back. My current blanket has just stopped working and I am working with the customer service representative to solve it again. For such a high cost blanket...it sure doesn't last...but if you take advantage of the warranty, and replace it frequently (for me it seems to be every 6 months to 1 year as I generally don't use the heating in the summer), then it is worth it. The blanket is very soft and comfortable.BTW I got the King Sleepwarmer Dual control heated blanket."
3,Not to easy.,"I thought this game was bad. There is unlockable characters and everything. But there is just no way to win 7 fights. You have to hit the computer a million times with jabs and it will probably lead to a knockdown. You have use this system because the computer crowds you and takes over the fight. If all you want is graphics by all means take, but if you want something more this is a rental style rumble."
4,Children of Immigrants Struggle to Assimilate,This is a wonderful book for help in finding the origin of the female immigrant identity crisis - especially the greek female. Others will equally benefit from it as it explains the struggle to assimilate into a modern culture yet retain old customs and traditions. Some of the aspects it captures is the struggle for independence; yet maintaing the dutiful daughter personna; the struggle to excel academically and professionally; yet never be threatening to a man. It's a wonderful book for the female struggling with these issues and those who love and care about this person.
3,Overall quality game,"NCAA Football 2001 is not a bad game I would give it 3.5 stars. The number of teams available really adds to it's replay value. This game doesn't have that great of graphics compared to the standard that has been set by PS2 games, however they are close to the best that you will find on the PSOne. The sound is very good. When your team has made a big play or a score at a key point in the game the crowd will be very loud to the point that it is hard to hear the referee's whistle. If you want a great college football game for PlayStation this is the one to get, just don't get too high of hopes for the graphics."
5,I'm Addicted,"This is the best game that I have ever bought. I love the dynasty, I love the controls, and I love the created schools and players, but I especially love the recruiting. You can practice plays, put yourself in tough situations. The other really good thing about the game is the momentum meter, It makes such a big difference in the game but none of the other football games have it. Whenever I play playstation this is the game that I play.buy it"
2,Overrated,"while this game may be hard and fun at first, after a while it becomes very easy and lame. there is no defense in the game what so ever, me and my friends play and the scores are like 63-60. and after a while it becomes a dud and trust me i have played a lot of games and this one will be over before it starts.."
3,It pains me,"I still listen to all my Deftones albums, which is why I don't need to buy this one. The album is good, but the songs sound the exact same as White Pony and Around the Fur. It pains me to see one of my favorite bands playing it safe...... However, it is a Deftones album so it is still good."
2,This isn't the Deftones,"What a letdown. This band has been going down hill slowly since White Pony and they've finally hit bottom. If I wanted to hear Team Sleep, I would have bought that record. I don't like Team Sleep and now I don't like the Deftones anymore. There isn't one great song on this album. The only reason I gave this more then one star is for the Songs Beware & Combat. Besides that, it's terrible. I don't care that it isn't heavy. I just care that is plain not good. I usually don't write reviews on here but I'm so disappointed that a band that used to be one of my favorites is now garbage that I had to let it out."
3,"Better in some area's, worse in others.","Guitar: The guitars here are still simple power chords like their other albums, but here there are a few more catchy riffs to help pass the time better.Drums: There are a couple songs here were the drums dont sound like a replacement for a metronome, but mostly they aren't very standout.Vocals: Chino doesn't seem to like his voice much, he fills it with vocal effects and vocal layers. There are some moments where his real voice comes through, and it sounds fine, but then it's drowned out by various computer settings.Lyrics: The lyrics here are still vague as ever. I think mostly he just wanted the songs to sound like they have a deeper meaning, and hoping his fans will forget that they sound like recycled lyrics from his other four cd's.AND WOULD IT KILL HIM NOT TO SAY ""YOU"" IN EVERY SONG!Dispite these problems, it is the best cd they have ever put out. But it is still a Deftones Cd."
5,Thank you.,"Thank you Deftones. This album is excellent.If you liked White Pony, then you will most definetely like this one. I am not saying that it really sounds like white pony. But they deffinetely went back to their 'art rock' style with this one."
2,It's one thing to recreate yourself but...,"This album does not do it. I've been an avid Deftones fan since Adrenaline came out, never really had a problem with any other Deftones album except this one. Even though some people claim self-titled was a ""step back,"" I hardly do not think it was. This album goes on to explore more ""electronic"" areas where there are no guitar. Sure it's a ""soothing"" album but this is not Deftones. This album sounds more like Team Sleep than it does the Deftones minus the very, very, few heavy tracks.Sure, White Pony had an excellent mix of both but the soothing tracks and the electronic tracks on this album are just plain boring. Recreating yourself by putting more electronic sounds in the music just does not seem to fit right with the Deftones. I'd almost rather have another ATF or White Pony recreated than listen to this bland album. Oh well, rumours are flying around saying this is their last album, who knows."
4,You a oo a oo,"Deftones are one of the best rock and roll bands around in this time period.I have no real complaints about this recording, other than it could use more songs with the emotional pull of ""Cherry Waves"" and ""Xerxes""."
5,wow...amazing,"I have listened to the tones for several years now and this album blew me away. Be carefull when you pop this into your cd player or deck for the first time, you will get lost in the music... my personal favorite deftones cd"
3,No White Pony,"I'm still not entirely impressed by this album. There's a few songs such as Xerces, Mein, and I enjoy the style of Pink Cellphone however most of the songs don't stick out and have that appeal that I was initially searching for. Contrary, to what ""harcore"" Deftone fans believing that ""White Pony"" was a flop, I believe that this was, by far, their best album. With each listen it takes me to a magical place deep within the lyrics and Chino's amazing vocals. ""Saturday Night Wrist"" just doesn't grasp me in that way. I like the 'Tone's new style but it could use a little more work."
4,good w/ the bad,"some stuff on here is really good and some seems mediocre.the slowers songs are more fleshed-out than the heavier ones(the heavy ones on this one seemed to just 'be there' instead of having real presence like usual.)a good album,but i hope this isn't their last."
5,Excellent,"This Album is great! Been a fan of the Tones since they first came out. I fell in love with their heaviness and just unique style. This band is really coming into their own. I know this may not be as hard as other albums, but I love a band that evolves and doesn't just keep putting out the same album. Their alternative influences show more and more. They aren't afraid to branch out."
5,AMAZING ACCOMPLISHMENT!,"The Deftones have come a long way to create this sleak, hard, mind blowing sound! It took me a couple listens by the time I had listened to the album the second time I was hooked! From bone crushing sounds from RATS!RATS!RATS! to the epic sounding CHERRY WAVES, just beautiful! This album easily hits a high mark on my top ten albums of the year!The only downfall for me was PINK CELLPHONE. To me it did not fiT with the feel of the other tracks and I did not really care for it. While listening, that is the only track I skip over!The deftones continue to grow with a new surreal sound that blends all of their amazing albums into one!!!GREAT WORK! Very memorable music!"
4,Saturday Night Wrist close to perfection,"I could write a long review, but I am too busy listening to this incredible album. I have all the Deftone's discs, and this is another great work of art."
4,still fun!,"not as good as the first, but still a lot of fun!Nice to see troma in letter-box (why not for tromeo&Juilet, lloyd?????)"
3,My eyes must be dead by now.,"Sequel to the cult hit THE TOXIC AVENGER is not that good and funny as the original and mote of the gore that makes this series best has been lef out leting the bed acting and comedy take over. If i was you, i wood look for part 1, but wath the hell, this one is worth a look. A ""longer Japanese version"" and ""a U.S. unrated Director's cut"" are said to be available. Let's hope so.1988. Troma. 96 Mins.Rated R for Violence, nudity/sexuality and for Comic Mischief."
1,Stay away!,"How do Troma have the nerve to sell this as the Director's Cut? It's missing most of the gore, violence and comedy that can be found in the true uncut version available in Japan. Troma always cram their DVDs with extras, some of them quite good, but that doesn't make up for ripping customers off with a useless version of one of their better films."
2,Can't Get Lost in the Dream,"First, I am not a serious opera critic, so I cannot address the quality of the voice issue in the way that some other reviewers have. I am, however, a regular consumer of opera. I attend the opera a couple of times a year and at the best of them, I am transported to a different place, lose all sense of self, time and place. - A few weeks ago I was at the Met and heard Flemming sing Violetta, for example and was nearly moved to tears.This production is disappointing to me because it has the feel of having been shot by a camcorder from the back of the room. Having seen Terfel and Flemming's DVD of Don Giovanni, I know it can be done much, much better. The problem here is that the set is enormous and the people are small. The camera takes too many distance shots where you can't see the singers and so it feels tinny.If I want opera for the musical quality alone, I will buy a CD. For a DVD, I want film-like production values and camera work. This DVD is a let down."
1,Eurotrash production,"Eurotrash is generally applied as a term by US commentators to criticise adversely European Regietheater productions, We in Europe think of Eurotrash as signifying vulgarity, over blown, ostentatious show. As such this Aida is a prime example of Eurotrash. What is Aida about? What does it have to say to us NOW? Verdi's seriousness of intent is lost in a sea of literalness, ridiculousness and vulgarity. Opera for those who believe opera is a show, without meaning for the 21st Century. This great work deserves the seriousness of attention we apply to Shakespeare. This is a totally empty spectacle with posturing puppets (who can sing,albeit well!)"
2,Where are the surtitles,"The music is fine, but why can't we be told before ordering whether there are surtitles (yes, in English please) before we order an opera?"
2,Buy the VHS tape instead,"I'm reviewing primarily for the DVD production quality (not performance). Great performance but picture/audio quality comparable to VHS. Doesn't utilise any of the enhancements offered on DVD. The picture quality has not been remastered nor the sound -it is Dolby Stereo! A real disappointment, what a wasted opportunity. DG could have really showcased opera on DVD. If you must, buy the video instead (you'll get 90% of the audio/video quality). I for one will not be wasting any more money on DG's DVDs. I hope they get their act together soon -I'm sure I'm not the only classical music fan who has spent thousands on home theater just to play movies."
3,Domingo weak as Radames,Although this performance is impressive in its staging etc. The weakness of Domingo in the role of Radames needs to be discussed. A lot of reviewers seem to be listening to a different performance to me.Domingo is always musically and dramatically convincing but produces some very tight top B flats in Celeste Aida. Listen to Pavarotti (video with Maazel) or Carreras (EMI recording with Karajan) to hear how the role should be sung. Waving arms around with the odd meaningful gesture does not cover up a vocally flawed performance.
2,Awkward performances ; poor viideo quality of the dvd,"While the sets are detailed and impressive, the production lacks ""atmosphere"". everything seems as it should but there is a clinical quality about it which makes it all a bit dull. Add to that an overly melodramatic performance that border on being comical.Worst of all is the utter poor video quality of the DVD. look elsewhere if your in search of aida for your dvd/bluray library."
5,Super Aida,"The singers are terrific as one would expect but my main concern here is the awesome production. This is the kind of Aida I expect to look at, a faithful and astounding recreation of Ancient Egypt, not the monstrosity poor Leontyne Price had to deal with in her farewell performanes at the Met, an ugly, awful show. Here we get the Cecil B. DeMille level of stage show and I for one do not ask for anything more. Just what the doctor ordered."
3,That special Day!,"This film shared during a group we had in for lunch on Bastille Day was much appreciated. We were expecting a travelog, but got much more. The film has a review of the French history behind this National Holiday. We also got what we expected a glimpse at how the French spend this important day."
3,"cute show, bad recording","i was really disapointed in the san francisco recording of this show. the voices are childish to the point of shrill and painful at times and my suggestion would be to invest in the london cast recording. 28 year olds won't ever sound like 10 year olds and they shouldn't try as hard as this cast did. also, the london cast recording has some extra songs that add a lot. despite this recording, the show is wonderfully fun and ranks right up there with You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown."
3,Not to sing an old tune but...,"I have to be boring and agree with nearly everyone else. These are not the best versions of the songs. I recently saw the Snoopy Musical in the New Players Theatre, Charing Cross, London and it blew me away. Yes, it's light humour and couldn't possibly be described as deep, but it is still thoroughly enjoyable. I would give the show 5/5 stars and the London singing 6/5 stars. This recording is amusing and has most of the best songs, but the singing isn't quite up to scratch (and isn't even ""singing"" in parts). Good, but sadly not great."
3,Get the London recording,"Please see my review for the London recording. Basically, the singing on this CD is of far inferior quality, and many songs are missing from this soundtrack. I do recommend purchasing the Snoopy!!! Musical CD with all my heart.. just not this version."
2,This Shouldn't Be Getting Good Revues,"All my revues are strictly from a listeners point of view, and this CD is not good from a listeners point of view. I haven't seen the show, and I feel other revues of this CD are based on having seen the show, which isn't fair. This CD isn't complete for one thing. The London cast, although I don't own it, nor have I ever listened to it, at least has the full score. But the main horror are the singers on this CD. They are just bad. People are turned off musical theater from CDs like this. I urge you not to buy this CD unless you are a collector, or have seen this show and want to hear a bad version. This is not for new listeners or even mature listeners looking for new musicals... this is not good. I don't know why people keep giving this CD more than three stars. The lyrics are decent, cute and funny, but the singing is unforgivable. Favorite song (only because I put one in every review): ""Poor Sweet Baby"""
5,Great for glass etching mask,I used this contact paper as a resist for cutting patterns on large glass panels for etching and blasting. it's perfect!
4,perfect,Spyro year of the dragon is amazing. It is great!! It is so much fun and you never get bored of it. I highley recomend it.
4,#1 Spyro,"Out of the 3 Spyro games (not including the new one for the PS2) Year of the Dragon is the best one. Just like the previous versions, your mission is to collect gems and this time, dinosaur eggs. The more eggs Spyro collects, the more ""worlds"" are open to him. Some eggsd are hidden in the levels, but a lot of them need to be earned by completing challenges such as skateboarding.Year of the Dragon lets you take control of four characters besides Spyro. Sheila the Kangaroo can perform a high jump as well as kick enemies with her feet. Sergeant Bird has a rocket launchers and can fly forever. There's also a Yeti and a monkey named Agent 9.The controls are easy, the graphics are nice and the sound is not bad.. you can't go wrong with this one."
4,almost brand new!,"completely satisfactory with the condition of the CD, However it was advertised with the book let and didn't come with one, and that was kinda the point of ordering it.."
2,Classic set of games,The main thing in this game is collecting eggs. It's fun and there's a lot to learn in order to progress to higher levels.
5,Spyro at His Best,"This third installment in the Spyro saga is simply the best. It seems that the designers learned from all their mistakes in the last two and did away with them, leaving you as close to a perfect game as you can get. It's an amazingly huge game; Takes a long time to get through. And best of all, you get to play as 6 other characters besides just Spyro."
3,Its Okay,"So once I got the game I was stoked, but some of the graphics eh not so great. It was pretty fun to play though."
4,Good title,"A fun title for a child or even an adult who is not into shooting enemies, blood, and gore, or the very fast pace of adult games. I like it."
3,ok game,"Well this game is ok ,but when you beat it gets kind of boring.Its not the best game I have played for my playstation.I have a few reasons whyFor one thing it gets so boring after I beat it .After you have beat it and gotten all the eggs you just run around killing all the bad guysFor another the cameara angle stinks.When you are in the boss levels it turns at the wrong time getting me killed.Otherwise this game ok I guess but it still getts a three star rating."
5,REALLY fun game!,In Year of the Dragon there are more playable charactors. Spyro has to save 150 dragon eggs from the evil Sorrceress. Really good music too. You should get it! Its fun!
5,THIS GAME RULES BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM.... IT'S HARD,"Okay! I love this game sooooo much!!!!! This was the first actual Spyro game I ever played but don't be tricked by Spyro's cute looks! This game is hard!The first levels are a piece of cake but once you get to midday gardens kiss that dream goodbye!Personally I love the skate boarding! My fav park is in EnchantedTowers. (To get there get the level egg and go inside the stand the ugly blown up sorceress was standing on. You can do that by jumping up the grassy ledge and flying over there.)I really wish that SCEA and insomatic games would make just a Spyro skate boarding game.Any way, if you are a beginner I don't recommend this game to you. You will probably get to frustrated and will get mad and then you can't do anything in the game right!All the middle peeps out there like me, I recommend this game to you but you do need a lot of time on your hands. And the advanced play the game but you won't finish it in a day."
5,Super Cool Game!!!!!,"A FANTASTIC game!If you like dragons you'll love this game.FUN 5 stars EDUCATIONAL 4 stars AGE RANGE 6-up.Cool gameplay,funworlds,wicked NEW powers like Supercharge,Superflame&SuperfreezeMore Challenges,NEW Vehicals like Skateboards,Subs and a hole lot more! 6 NEW characters to play,you can even play as Sparks! TheSuper Bonus World is your prize after you collect all the gems and eggs!!!You'll have a great time flying,flameing and flapping your wings at the same time.When flying you can AirCharge at SUPER SPEEDS!!! YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!Spyro 3 Is your pasport to adventure!!!!! - Pamela,Sylvia"
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"(My 10 year old daughter wrote this review) This is the best of the 3 playstation games. You rescue 150 eggs and 15,000 gems. I have 96% so far. I beat the Sorceress. You play as other characters too: Sheila the kangaroo(you can jump sky-high!), Sgt. Byrd the flying penguin(with rocket launchers!), Bently the yeti (super-strength!), Agent 9 the monkey (with a laser-blaster!), Sparx the dragonfly (he can breath fire!) and even Hunter the cheetah (only in speedways)! A MUST HAVE!"
2,Misinformation,"There was a letter sent that said he had listed on his review that there would be a transponder, and he changed his story in his email to me. He is selling faulty defective products that don't work."
1,There is a BUG in this game.,"This game WOULD have gotten a rating of four or five stars, if it weren't for a nasty little bug that keeps you from finishing this game. You can see ... for all of the details on it. But in short, if you enter a 'Speedway' round and don't finish it and get your egg, you never will. The game has been fixed and a newer version is available, but if you have the broken version the only way to finish the game is to send your memory card to Sony. Since Sony won't replace the defective version of the game, I rate this one ONE star and recommend Spyro fans avoid it."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"While this book was a good source of information on Anne Boleyn's world, the facts given about Anne herself were sketchy at best. In spite of fascinating details such as descriptions of the French court where Anne grew up and the accounts of the court procedures of Henry VIII's divorce from Katharine of Aragon, one never really gets the feel of Anne as a real person. The lack of information about Anne's day-to-day life is one reason for this, but the fact remains that this is simply not one of Erickson's best biographies.Enjoy this book, but read Antonia Fraser's ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII"" for a truer portrait of Anne Boleyn."
2,Bad history,"I bought a number of Carolly Erickson's Tudor biographies with a gift certificate; I hope that the others impress me more than ""Mistress Anne"" did. Miss Erickson uses about six main sources and quotes endlessly from them--the number of quotation marks on each page grows tiresome--which is a sure sign of lazy writing. The picture section in the middle, for some reason, includes pictures of Catherine Parr and Mary Queen of Scots--important figures in Tudor history, to be sure, but, historically, they didn't even show up until after Anne Boleyn's death; and they appear nowhere in the book, as well! Talk about sloppy! I was completely unimpressed with this 'pop history' of Anne Boleyn, but plan on reading the other biographies I purchased. If I'm happier with the others, maybe I'll post a more positive review of one of them."
2,Inevitable limitations,"Erickson's avowed practice of giving equal weight to each part of a subject's life, rather than concentrating on the period when the subject was ""famous,"" causes two major problems this time. First, there is (or was at the time of Erickson's work) little or no documentation of Anne Boleyn's early life; thus, for much of the book we are repeatedly confronted with statements of how Anne ""must have"" felt, reacted, behaved, etc. Second, the short period in which Anne strutted upon the world stage skims by far too quickly, with too little detail. True, Anne ""must have"" felt that way about events herself -- but surely the benefit of time and perspective is that we can linger and delve into the subject. Perhaps it is impossible to write a really adequate biography of Anne Boleyn."
3,Rather ponderous and off track,"In a manner which I have found unfortunately typical of Carolly Erickson's writing, ""Mistress Anne"" contains many details about court life (including ""trivia"" not typical of books on the subject), yet not enough about Anne herself. The rather rambling references to, for example, Anne's days at the French court became tedious. My impression was of a collection of material which could be interesting in a ""classroom lecture"" setting, where it is assumed that the hearers are studying the entire era and would enjoy tidbits not found in their textbooks, but which makes boring reading on its own."
3,Too vague,"While Mistress Anne is interesting in the way a novel is interesting, I would not recommend it if you are seriously researching either Anne Boleyn or Henry VIII. Rather, I would point you *TO* Alison Weir's ""Six Wives"" which is both well-written and meticulously detailed, and *AWAY* from Retha Warnicke's ""Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn"" (pretentiously, ponderously written, hard to follow, containing some conclusions that are neither fully supported by the facts, nor arrived at by other historians). While Mistress Anne is ""fun"" -- I fully recommend it for a ""good read"" -- it does not detail events satisfactorily. Dates are missing in an excessive number of instances, and some events are presented out of chronological order, causing some confusion. However, like I said, it's great fun to read and gives you a good overview of the subject."
1,Awful,"I started reading this book at the same time I was reading another biography of Anne Boleyn(eric ives) and the difference is striking. I confess that I didn't finish Carolly Erickson's attempt. That's how utterly I disliked it. This is popular history at it's lowest, full of clich√©s and stereotypes with Anne a sex pot on the loose in Henry VIII's England.Do not read this book if you want to get a clear, complete and true image of Anne Boleyn."
3,decent,"I was doing a report on the life of Anne Boleyn, and this was the only book in my school library that was dedicated solely to Anne... I read it and I was unsatisfied :| It was really vague, and the book only brushed the surface of the iceberg. I had to refer to various sources to find more information... this gave too little. I would recommend Antonia Fraser's Six Wives of Henry the VIII instead..."
1,Is this history?,"I read this book for school, but I chose it because I am interested in the Tudor period. I was hoping to gain a little more insight on the character of Anne Boleyn. This book was very disappointing. It hardly even mentions Anne at all. It seems more like a novel than a history. I do not recommend reading this book if you are wanting to learn more about Anne Boleyn. It's one of the worst, if not THE worst, biography I have ever read."
2,"The subject was interesting, however","I read ""Mistress Anne"" after finishing Hilary Mandel's ""Bring Up the Bodies"", because I wanted to learn more about the Anne Boleyn. It took me a while to get used to the biographical format, but I found the subject fascinating. I only gave the book 2 stars because of the inordinate amount of typographical errors (words run together, incomplete paragraphs, etc.). I started bookmarking the pages and found an error on almost every page. I found this distracting and it took away from the flow of the story. We also have another book by Caroly Erickson on our Kindles, ""Bloody Mary"", I hesitate to read it because my husband tells me that there numerous editing errors in this book, as well."
2,Only 3 Songs Are Awesome,"Most of the CD is filled w/ songs you'd never wanna hear. The best one is ""your woman"", but it doesn't make up for the other terrible ones."
2,Can I have My Time Back Please!,"I was told by a friend with similar tastes in books that this is good series.I read the first book, and was underwhelmed. Denning has great difficulty developing his characters, and plots.While they are extremely imaginative, and may work well as a movie, they are terrible in book format. The number of plot holes you have to ignore, and assumptions you have to make is ridiculous.I was hoping that the second book would be better than the first. It is not. I will read the third one just because I want to see how it ends, but suspect I will also dislike it."
3,"Not as good as Book 1, but still entertaining","I have to say this book was a little bit of a let-down from the first (and excellent) bookThe Verdant Passage: Prism Pentad, Book 1in the Prism Pentad series. Mostly because it only has Rikus from the original book, and while he is a great, savage, and courageous character, I think there may have been too much of him in this book. It seems like it takes the whole book to do something that should have taken a lot less pages - but I guess it's all part of the journey. This is particularly noticeable with the things and people that happen to Rikus. There is some more great stuff in here about the ancient history of Athas, which is always great for me to read, having never played the Dark Sun D&D; setting itself. This book reminded me of some of the more monotonous Warhammer books, in that it seemed like it was just one battle scene after another. I'm still sticking with the series though, and can't wait to readThe Amber Enchantress (Prism Pentad, Book 3)."
3,A decent book in a great series,"Though this book lacked much of the strength that was in the first book in the series (I'm sorry I forgot the title), the heroes are still great. The many scenes of the battle are great, but Rikus' character still got on my nerves as he performed one stupid act after another. The final battle in Urik was great and the finish was excellent. Though my DM strongly disliked this series for it made any hero second to the exploits of Rikus, Agis, and Sadira, I still found it to be a most excellent series. The only problem is that if I were to write on my own parties actions in Dark Sun they would contradict almost everything in this series. ::Shrug:: Oh well."
4,replacement blades,Blades r what I needed. Service was okay. Ordered 3 blades recieved 2 1 on backorder took another week to get it. Communication with company was lagging.
3,"Cheap phone, topples over easily on its base, very loud buttons","Pressing the buttons generates very loud tones on this phone, but I found it awkward to have a ""Talk"" button at all. It is counter-intuitive to have a button like that, but be able to dial without pressing it, making you think that it should be pressed if you want to initiate the call. I never had any technical problems with it, but it has more of a learning curve than you would expect. The plastic base station that is shown in the photo is so much more lightweight than the phone that it easily topples over. I ended up giving this away to someone who needed a landline telephone really badly."
1,this phone is NOT headset compatible !!,"This may be a perfectly good phone, and I've had great success with other Uniden products. But Amazon's specifications for this product describe it as ""headset compatible"". This phone has no headset jack, and is most definitely NOT headset compatible. Since I require a headset, you can imagine how happy I am with this product."
4,highly recommendable,"Excelent book, clear and direct explanations... a good book for any type of tai chi student, but specially for those who are entering the practice and study of tai chi."
5,Perfect!,"Lovely console table. Color is a little more red - but other reviews had indicated that & it is fine.Was pretty easy to put together. Just make sure you put the shelves in the correct order - yes it does make a difference.Very turdy, nicely styled."
4,Classic Bon Scott!,"Thirty years ago I worked with a yound musician named BonScott. Through his formative years with the Valentines and then ontohis time in Fraternity, the precursor to AC/DC. What you hear in this record is the quality of Bon's voice, its incredible power and range. Much of which was lost in the later years of AC/DC. You also hear the command of music which evolved into 50% of the drive that made AC/DC so successful. 30 years ago I saw a Fraternity album in a music store and passed it by. What a mistake! Fraternity's signature tune, Seasons, is just as great today as it ever was. This is a MUST HAVE for any Bon Scott fan."

That's the reason I don't like this match. Get some new tag teams or throw away the belts. 1/57)HHH vs. RKO- Great main event. I didn't know who to cheer for. I like Randy Orton and Triple H. Total screw job in the end though. 5/5Overall a great pay-per-view. I really liked it.
2,Unforgiven 04,Personally i thought it sucked.1.Benoit&Regal; Vs.Evolution.Slow and boring match.4/102.Womens Title:TrishVs.Victoria.STUPID.2/103.TomkoVs.Richards.ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.0/104.IC Title:Y2JVs.CLB.Decent Ladder Match.Nuttin Special.7.5/105.KaneVs.Michaels.Couldve ben Better.6.5/106.La'ResistanceVs.Rhyno&Tajiri.SUCKED.2;/107.OrtonVs.HHH.Best match of the nite.Even though the ending sucked it was still a very good match.To top off the second worst ppv of the raw brand.The crowd was dead all nite long.
3,Orton not a fluke,"Uhm, everyone does realize this is all fake, correct?Triple H is the champ again to raise the ratings. For those who believe ""Benoit was a great champion,"" that means nothing to the business.He was a bore and the ratings went into the toilet. Triple H is champ again and the ratings are back up. It's like a really bad soap opera that is predictable and mundane.Oh and please don't say you really think John Cena got beat up in a bar. He is in Australia filming a movie."
4,Kids Review!,"2 out of 3 falls would be great, but i think they should have just a normal match first and then have the 2 out of 3 falls at survivor series."
2,Unforgiven!!,"Unforgiven 2004 will not be soon forgotten, as the action was highlighted by the crowning of two new champions.See Chris Jericho out-climb the charismatic Christian to capture the vacant Intercontinental Championship in a thrilling Ladder Match. Watch Triple H Pedigree his way to another World Heavyweight Championship reign he defeats Randy Orton in the main event."
4,good ppv better than summer slam,1. Chris Benoit & William Regal vs Batista & Ric Flair- Good match. They fought well together. Great ending. 8-102. Women's championship Trish Stratus vs Victoria-Ok womens match. 5-103. Tyson Tomko vs The Mystery Women- Boring skip. 1-104. Ladder Match IC Championship Y2J vs Christan- Awesome match. Many great spots off the ladder. 9-105. No DQ HBK vs Kane- Great match. Not many wepons used. 8-106. World Tag-Team championship Rhyno and Tajiri vs La resistance -Did you know that at Unforgiven 2001 that Tajiri and Rhyno vs each other and 3 years later there fighting for the Tag-Team Championship.Any about the match it was ok not as good as the first tag-team match. 7-107. World Heavyweight Championship Randy Orton vs HHH- Great match.Much beter then the Royal Rumble match. 9-10
3,WWE UNFORGIVEN,"Randy Orton vs HHH - Randy Orton wins Ric Flair comes out while the ref is down and nails HHH in the head with a steel chair and then Orton wins just like unfrogiven 2002this match will be great as will jerich ochristian and hbk kane but what about the rest they will be boring bring back jeff hardy,stone cold, the rock, hogan, shane, steph."
5,Awsomes game,This is a great Castlevania game and it came in in great condition. Works great and very please. If only all used games can come in this way.
3,castlevania 2,"This game is the weakest of the old NES castlevania trilogy. This game is only fun if you are a die hard castlevania fan. This game is annoying because it had so many changes from the original and the sequal. The game is more of an adventure game instead of a ""kill them all"" game. You have to collect items and use those items to do trivial things. There aren't as many ending bosses as there was in the original. The transition from day to night is highly frustrating. Buy this game only if you intend to collect it."
3,"Good, but criptic as hell",Well if you have read my review on the first castlevania game then you know that I love these games. Simon's quest is ok at most but not a worthy successer to Castlevania. First off the game is not a side scroller like the first game and that can get tricky on where you are suppose to go. Second a lot of parts you would never figure out unless you have a walktrough for example at the end of each mansion Simon must throw a oak stake at a glowing orb how are suppose to know that without a walktrough better yet how was a kid in 1988 without internet figure that out it just blows the mind. But all in all I don't hate this game just print out a walktrough and you are fine.
4,Works great.,"If it holds up over time, this will have been a great purchase. Bought new computer but still needed to access old one. Thus unit allowed switching between the two on the same monitor with a simple flip of the switch. Though the resolution-settings differed between the computers, not an issue."
1,switch knob broke,"I bought this switch box to use so that I could hook my monitor up to both my laptop and my desktop. It worked very well at first, but now I am quite unhappy to report that the plastic switch knob has broken and so, to switch back and forth a plyers is necessary. Inconvenient at best."
4,Manual VGA switch box,"I use this to switch between my monitor and tv.I did have them both wire up together, but it made my monitor blury, now I switch from one to the other.The box looks a bit old fashioned but it does the job."
2,Perfect when it works,"I ordered one July 2008, it stopped working November 2008, its cheaplymade and wears out fast, I used it once or twice a day to switchvideo going to a projector, and near the last I had to wiggle theswitch in order to get it working, when it works it works well."
3,Great but lots of shadows,"Great product, works as expected but creates lots of shadows on the screen that are not there when plugged in directly so they are artifacts from the switch box."
1,"Click, no click and then...click again? Returned it!","I purchased this switchbox so that I could toggle between at 15"" computer monitor and a 40"" flat screen TV without changing the cable on the back of the computer each time. I installed the cables, turned the switch and heard an audible click. When I turned the switch back there was no sound, but around 15 seconds later, there was a very faint click. As I toggled back and forth between the displays using the switchbox, only the monitor hooked to the setting that had the audible click would display correctly. So, back it went. In summary, not a good product. Tried to give NO STARS, but I guess you can't. :("
1,display is much worst than without switch,"If you want a switch, then, don't buy this, because it product terrible output pictures,tons of shaking. What is the point if a switch does not product the same picture to start with? It creates a problem by solving one. I hate product like this."
3,Kinda weird,"This book is pretty bizarre. It contains interesting info on characters, but leads me to wonder where they got it at. Did they just make up the fact that Shadow enjoys hardboiled eggs or that Cyan carries a pocket watch with family photo?"
3,They could have done a better job on this Guide!,"This book was alright. It was hard to undertand, and they used the Japanese names for most of the weapons. They also had a hard time spelling Strago's name correctly (Stargo, Strahgo). On the good side, this book had detailed map to the room, and wallpaper! The item and weapon info was excellent, but I needed another Strategy Guide just to complete all the secrets!"
1,The WORST,"Where to start? This is the WORST guide I have ever seen. It gives no info on any secrets. It's in black and white. It makes up info on the characters. Judging from the thickness you would think it was quite detailed, but in reality it just gave statistics of monsters and listed the towns. Dreadful to read. This was a huge wart on the toe of game guides everywhere."
2,"Lots of Information, but Not Very Useful","I own all of the published FF6 guides, and I have to say that this one is my least favorite. While it contains some interesting facts, such as a timeline of events that took place before the game and facts about each character's personality, it relies heavily on the Japanese version.However, the main drawback to this guide is not the quirky translation but the dated style. It is black and white and mostly text, like some other guides from the 80s and early 90s. The maps are hand-drawn outlines that are too general to be useful."
2,Written Quickly,"The writer's name is given as ""Hayaku Kaku"", which is most certainly a pen-name as it uses the Japanese words ""hayaku"" (quickly) and ""kaku"" (to write). That certainly explains a lot! The guide was quite obviously written using a Japanese version of the game, probably so it could be published in time with the English release of the game, but it means that their best-guess translation of some items, locations and characters could be confusing to some players.Fun as a bathroom read, but better information can be found elsewhere."
3,A hints and tips guide.,This is merely a hints and tips kind of guide. It lets you know what items are in an area but does not tell you how to get them and the maps are of no real help at all. They are all in black and white and don't tell you where any shops or anything are. If you are looking for a complete walk through I suggest getting the anthology guide.
3,Could have been a little better...,"The book was based more off of the Japanese version of the game, not the American. However, it does have a lot of information and statistics. It will definitely get you through the game."
5,Great Buy!,This is a great product that AMD has put out. I have had it for a little over a month with no problems. My last computer had a Pentium 4 and the Pentium 4 processor is not even in the same league as the AMD Athalon.If you want to have a computer for gaming and normal media editing this is the way to go. If you more into the higher end of digital editing check out other AMD processors. I mean this processor is good for what I do... but I don't think I would use it for professional digital editing.I have been using my pc mainly for gaming (and a little bit of college work) and it has had superior performance. The only draw back is the price (but I would have paid even more for the athalon over the pentium 4). But even with the high price (okay I know that any decent processor is just plain out expensive) it was well worth it! Buy the processor!
1,fishy price,"It was a great cpu back in the day, but 400+ dollars? Must be a glitch since I've seen this CPU sell for about 30-50 dollars elsewhere, hmmmm...."
5,Reynolds Price,"The book was delivered in a timely manner and in perfect shape. I was reading it for a discussion group led by a retired prof. and found it very interesting and have loaned it to a friend. I am interested in reading more about Southern Writers, especially those from NC."
3,"An insightful novel, focusing on interpersonal relationships","Bridge Boatner, a college student, enters the world of Juniper summer camp as a counselor. As the world seems to stop in the bubble of the camp, Bridge comes into contact with one very special person, one who belongs to a horrible past. Taking place before all of the modern evils of our society, such as free love, and the marajuana movement, it focuses on the relationship between a very talented boy and his fresh camp counselor. With a camp full of prepubescent boys, themes such as sexuality and religion play a deep part in the story line. However, the overwhelming theme is about Bridge, and whether or not he did for the boy, what he couldn't do for his father."
4,Classic,"Johnny Duncan was a very popular country singer in the seventies. His songs were pure and simple. Many songs such as ""Sweet Country woman"" and ""Stranger"" were major country hits. Listening to these songs brings back memories. Janie Fricke did many of the female vocals on these songs such as ""Stranger"" and ""Looking for a rondevous""."
5,What country music was and we miss it...,This Johnny Duncan CD represents the great country music of the 70's...I had these songs on a Johnny Duncan hits 8-track and it's great to be able to get a new release of his hits...all the songs on this collection are great stuff and bring back memories!
5,10 TOP 10 HITS -- Great Duncan music!,"Johnny Duncan's music is sooo smooth and enjoyable to listen to.He had 39 songs chart between 1967 and 1986. Ten of those made the top ten.Here are the original recordings of those ten, by ""Sony music"" in 2001.This is a great collection of ten hits.If you're a Johnny Duncan fan you might the ""23 Original hits,It couldn't have been any better"" c.d. by ""collectors choice""""Sony music special products"" in 2003.All ten of these songs are there also plus 13 mors original hits.Whatever you choose, Johnny Duncan is ALWAYS good music.Detailed comments of ""23 original hits"" can be found at that location under""THIS IS TRUELY A FIVE STAR - PLUS C.D."""
4,This is a great CD,"I was at a Jainnie frickie concert and she informed me that Jonny Dunkan has passed on, what a lose for country fans everywhere. This has most of his greatest hits and is well worth your money. A lot of the songs have Janei frickie as a backup or duet. this is a wnderfull CD."
1,The First edition was much better.,"Unfortunatley, this is a bad book. The first editon was much better. Wolfe wants us to take her views seriously, but we can't because she comes across as a writer who does not have the knowledge to separate science from her own personal unfounded views. I cannot tell if this is supposed be a new-age philosphy book or a scientifically founded manual to help someone be a vegetarian. Wolfe has done vegetarianism a diservice in this book."
2,Jumbled,"I bought this book after deciding to become a lacto-ovo, and figured I could use a book on how to do it properly. I found this book at my local Borders, and bought it. It was a big waste of my money.First off, she comes of as ""Holier Than Thou,"" in a sense labeling you as ignorant until now. But you've finally seen the light, you poor little child. She seems to belittle anyone short of staunch vegans.Next, she throws in a lot of herbal 'remedies' and claims that a vegetarian diet will eliminate your acne, PMS, and other health problems, because everything definately stems from eating meat. It sounds like snake oil.She vehemently pushes the vegetarian diet/lifestyle as the only way to be healthy, and that if you switch to the vegetarian diet, all your troubles will be gone the moment you put that broccoli into your mouth. I got better information in the vegetarian section of the Complete Idiot's Guide to Total Nutrition."
5,One of the bright spots from the 80's,"Yes this show is probably best remembered as the birth place of The Simpsons, but Tracey is such a comic talent and the thing I remember best about the show was her ability to take a popular song such as the Rolling Stones ""Paint it Black"" and do a skit about it where she had her kitchen remodeled and in the end, everything was painted black.I'll be one of the first in line to pick this DVD up if and when it is released. I can see Tracey now in her closing monologe wearing that big pink robe and telling people to ""Go home, just go home."""
2,"Pool Float, Spongex","I was replacing a float that had lasted a few years. This one arrived...and it's not the thickness of the ""original"". Be sure to check for the thickness of the float when you order!!! It makes a BIG difference in the stability on the water!! (Shame on me for taking their word for it when they said ""original pool float""!!)"
2,NO,"Gotta be honest...I cannot hate on the man's talent. He is a very talented saxophone player. However, the music is just not interesting. The sax line on the title track grabbed my attention because it was an amazing line. Other than that, I was not impressed by this album at all. The drums (excuse me drum tracks) were very generic and it just sounded like any other ""smooth jazz"" album. I really thought his album would be different based on all the hype he has been getting. It just goes to show what a little marketing and publicity can do for a musician. I saw a live show of his too...I was highly displeased. He made every song long and drawn out and made me want to go backstage and unplug all the monitors. He will have a lot of fans because the average person is not a musician and will not be as critical as I am. As for me, I do not recommend buying this."
5,the shiznits,The best overall jazz CD that I have purchased this year.This CD is the bomb-Blee-za. This CD is good for the soul.This CD completed my life this year; as the total jazz lover that I am.You will not be sorry that you purchased this one.
5,"So,So Glad I reached Mike Phillips","Finally...a young, hip musician has come along to remind me of what I first liked about instrumental artists. Mike Phillips plays with passion, drive and an urgency that separates him from the bunch. I really dig ""Just One Take,"" ""A True Story"" and ""Huron Ave,"" but the laid back side of my loves ""Baby Calls"" and the part of me that needs to do some serious head-nodding can't get enough of ""Tonite."" I can't wait to see him LIVE!!!"
1,You Have Reached Mike Phillips,the product was defective on one track upon receipt. I was unsure of how to go about contacting someone because I gave this item as a gift and they actually advised me. Is there a way to replace the item? The other CD Uncommon Denominator was fine.
5,Wow!!!!,"The new Mike Phillips cd is incredible..I first heard about Mike after I heard him play with Jill Scott and I couldnt wait for his record to drop..After I heard him on the Jill Scott Live album I knew this was a must have cd..My favorite tunes are ""Stop What Ya Doin"", ""Will You Stick With Me"" and ""Wonderful and Special""..I think this will be the Jazz cd that people are going to talk about..The people at Hidden Beach just keep doing it..First Jill and then Unwrapped and now Mike Phillips..Hidden Beach please keep bringing the HEAT!!!!"
2,Am I listening to the same CD as the other listeners.,"PEOPLE PEOPLE PEOPLE!!!What are you thinking about this CD ain't nothing compared to Jeff Bradshaw's CD. Mike Phillips ain't nothing but a black Kenny G. First off you have to unserstand that just because it is instrumental doesn't mean it's jazz. This music belongs in the SMOOTH JAZZ section. The only reason why I am being so hard is because I play the sax and what he is doing anyone can do. He needs more and better supporting cast on his next CD and he needs to use a band next time,studio stuff ain't cuttin' it for me and I know it ain't good enough for a lot of other musicians. The only reason why I gave this CD two stars is because it's good to fall asleep to."
5,En Lighten Yourself,"Malidoma Patrice Some has an extraordinary gift for language. This is combined with his indigenous and tribal childhood experience reveals that our modern ways weren't the only way people survived. In fact, indigenous ways served humanity much longer, and possibly more successfully, than our modern ways which might be bringing about the demise of the planet we call home. This book will leave you with an appreciation of rituals designed to foster harmony and community. They are very different from our modern rituals that seem to keep us isolated and fearful. If you are looking for a way to touch your deeper soul, this will give you that access."
5,Ritual....,This book captured my full attention from page one. It is a wonderfully informative guide into the power of healing and community-building. I would recommend it without hesitation.
3,too boring......,thiis book was way too boring! and it didn't hav a meaning to it at all! oh and i'm the first one whos reviewed it 'cause nobody liked it! i can imagine that but i kinda liked it
5,I cannot wait to re-read this book!,"I'm 22 now, but when I went into middle school, this book was my very favorite. It really helped me through the tough times...it made me feel good to think that I wasn't the only one who felt the way I did about things...obviously the author knew and communicated it through her character. I now work in a children's library and I have asked my supervisor to buy the book for the stacks. I think every 10-12 year old girl would love to read it!"
5,The hard times of middle School,I had a very fun time reading this book. I think that Jr high or middle school is just as hard as it is for the young lady in the story. The book had a lot of simalters to my life when I entered middle school. I think that she was not to far off about her ideals of middle school. I think that it is a really funny book but it does realte to my life and that is a little wierd. I didn;t have a much troble starting middle school as she did but it was very hard to begin. I was surprised that she had more troble adjusting to middle school because I did too. I really liked reading this book and I would read it again and agian.
4,Quality Interpretation of Two Beautiful Clarinet Sonatas,"Here are presented two Clarinet Sonatas, the first by J. Brahms, which was one of his last works, and the second by M. Reger. And they are both very beautiful! I might say I like Brahms a little better here (more melodious), but both are delightful. And this disc offers the individual an opportunity to experience the work of one of the last great Classicists, Max Reger! Some critics believe his work is unduly ignored, or unfortunately by-passed; but one can make up one's own mind. I think he deserves to be better known; virtually unknown outside of the classical music world... His clarinet sonata is professionally done, and very handsome. The disc finishes with a couple of short pieces by Reger. Recommended. [The clarinet, btw, makes a beautiful accompaniment with the piano.]"
5,Wonderful teaching tool...,"My nearly year old daughter LOVED me reading this to her and partly she was interested in body parts, especially boys I think and I like that this book shows drawings of naked people, male and female...in a very no big deal kinda way.Talks about good and bad touching, it is a gentle approach to a subject I haven't wanted to talk about because of not feeling like i wanted to instill fear in my child and with this book I feel good about educating her on this."
3,Grandpa in the shower looks/feels/smells fishy,"For the most part, i really enjoy A Very Touching Book. The illustrations and the humorous way that things are presented are great. Unfortunately, there is one page that makes me hesitate to use this book with the kids i work with. There's a page where the child gets really dirty doing something with Grandpa and then the two hop into the shower together. Sorry, but that smacks of common abusive settings to me. Many, many of my clients have been abused by someone in the bathtub. Maybe Grandpa in this instance was okay, but with the frequency of abuse in such settings, i cannot endorse this as a ""safe"" setting and have to skip this section with my kids."
3,Good skillet,"This 8"" skillet as well as a 10"" were purchased to replace older ones that the teflon was worn out and chipped. Those pans were great, lasted many years, and cooked evenly. Love the shape of the sides of these skillets, they are deep. The new pans are now much lighter in weight and seem to be bowed out (kind of warped looking, maybe like they are ""seconds"" and not first-quality). Also the new skillets are made in China, the old ones were made in Thailand. Huge difference in quality. But, unless I find another brand of skillet with the same shape, I will continue to purchase the Revere skillets. Also, wish the 8"" had a matching lid."
4,Old stand by still a good buy,I have purchased several of these over the years (not all at Amazon). I find they are a good buy that delivers several years service. In our house this pan is used frequently and serves us well. Delivery was prompt and without any issues.
4,Deep skillet,"If you're looking for a nice deep skillet that you can use to keep food from landing on the stovetop everytime you stir, this is it. I had one with black outside for several years, needed to replace it and I found this one. The only con is that the outside will scatch if used on a gas stove, but so many other pans do that very same thing."
4,It does the job,It is a good product. The only problem is the out side finish. The dishwasher brakes it down or appears too. The finish is different after several washing- no shining finish. For the price I would buy it again.
5,a really good game,i havent played this game in years but i really do remember it was a good game it was put out when the jrpgs were going strong it is one of the best square games out there
4,say and tip,Threads of fate is the best of it`s kind. It is in a 3D world. Choose Mint for a hard game. Choose Rue for an easy. that`s a tip
3,Threads of Fate,"Threads of fate was a great game , But it laked the longness that older gamers would like . The plot is very good and so are the characters."
5,great game,"im a big fan of the brave fencer musashi game, and instead of making a sequel, the made this. it has the same graphics and gameplay, and left a shadow of the assimilation technic, though in this you transform. all in all a great game"
3,A Rather Lackluster Spider-Man,"This Spider-Man is based off his first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15. The sculpt captures the look of Spider-Man, but overall the figure leaves a bit to be desired. First of all, it is made with very soft plastic, so the legs have a tendancy to warp into strange shapes. Also, due to the soft plastic, you ahve to be very careful moving the joints. It seems very easy to break if you force it too much. There is also quite a bit of paint bleeding from the black lines in his outfit. However, most collectors will want this figure regardless of any flaws, as it contains the torso and head of the Sentinal. If you collect each figure in the wave you can assemble a giant figure. Still, the figure itself does leave much to be desired."
4,Spidey in All his Glory!,"Like many people when I saw that Spider-man was getting the Legends treatment, I inwardly groaned. With the Spiderman Classics line doing so well, and the articulation greatly increasing, I thought we'd be getting something like we already had several of. I was very pleasantly supprised to find a wonderful figure. Not only is the Head piece crucial to build the Sentinel, but the figure is great. The clear display base is perfect and he can almost perfectly mimic his now famous Amazing Fantasy #15 Cover pose.Like I said the articulation is great and the Sentinel piece alone is worth money."
3,A step backward for Crash devotees,"This game is not as fun or as involved as previous Crash games. If, after GTR, you expect a lot of 3D animation, and many scenes you will not get it with this game. So far (after 2 warp rooms or levels), it just seems to be variations of a few games but with ever increasing difficulty. I was sorely disappointed."
4,Fairly good game,"I bought crash bash because I was so pleased with all of the other crash bandicoot games, what I liked best about this game was that you could battle with 4 people. My friends really liked this game. The graphics are pretty good in this game just like all the other crash games.The adventure mode is ok, too.It is just a little challenging but I like a challenge.I gave this 4 stars because it is a good game but I didnt like it as much as crash3 or CTR."
5,the best crash yet,"i got this game for christmas and it's my favorite game i ever had.I think crash bash is way better then mario party for N64. If you've never played a crash game before this is the one to play.the lvl are easy at first ,but once you get further it starts to get hard and even funner.The characters are, crash,coco,dingodile,tiny,cortex,dr.n biro,koala kong,and my favorite rilla roo."
5,best crash ever,"4 player action, B.A would buy it again and again, cd case broke in the mail, but I didn't care"
3,Not worth it,"I enjoyed all the previous Crash Games, especially Crash Team Racing, so I decided to buy this one. I was dissapointed because I got bored of it very quickly. The games are the same old games but in 3D. The Crash characters are blended in well with the game but I just didn't enjoy it. The main good thing about this game is that four people can play at the same time; and they can choose from a large selection of about 24 games. The game isn't any good for one player to play.I would recommend it, but only if there is somebody else to play with."
3,Crash has been bashed. What a terrible shame.,"First things first. This game has a large amount of repetition. The games start out with a simple set of objectives from old arcade games. After you finsh the first set of games, you do the game again, but this time with a small new element thrown in. Without a dought, this gets boring quickly. To make it worse, the one player mode can be down right boring. There is absoulutly no backing force to keep you going. This might be part of the franchis's new develeper and owning company (it's Universal Studios for those of you who didn't know). It's sad that the preveous titles were instant classics and this one, with all its potential, could not follow through. What a terrible shame."
2,Crash Bash -Crahes,....O.k if you want to go head to Head or 4 against 4 but Avoid the Adventure Levels. With it's overbearing YOU FAIL every time you lose no such reminder if you win by the way. It's a bit Too Harsh for the young players the game is intended for. I feel as though i wasted my money . A FAR Cry from Crash Bandicoot: Warped
4,"What a Party, HUH?!","Hi. I'm Aaron.I love this game. It kicks the Mario Party series by 1,000 points. The only problems are: the Crash Dash battles; the Midevil Mahem battles; the 3rd Ballistic battle where N.Gin fires balls at you; and the fact that you have to have a certain number of gems and crystals before you can enter the bosses after boss 1. Other than that, we're fine with this game. The game is exstreamly well created. Oxide is my brother's favorite character from Crash (don't ask). I like Crash the best. I don't know any cheats for this one. This is a great game. If you have a PS or a PS2, I recommend trying this game and seeing if you like it."
1,Product Warning,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great game. However, customers must be warned. If you got a PlayStation overseas (like the Philippines) or modified it to play games like Dance Dance Revolution (that American developers are not bringing to the US), Crash Bash will not play. Kudos to them for making anti-piracy software, but some people end up buying modified machines without even knowing it."
3,An ok game of racing of crashing on race courses,I found this game a little tedious and not better than Mario Kart for crash contests. Crashing is serious business and you need the absolute best graphics to do it enjoyably.
3,Much stronger on Theory than actual Practice.,"Despite its subtitle, ""Leadership: Theory & Practice"" emphasizes the former much more than the latter. Scholars of leadership looking for theoretical exegeses & interpretive typologies may find what they're seeking in Northouse's analysis. Leadership practitioners (or high school educators, like me) may find less useful grist for their mills here. I appreciated many of the instruments Northouse cites here for assessing different aspects of leadership. But I found little spark here to distinguish ""Leadership"" from the quotidian genre of introductory college textbooks."
1,Crtical Evaluation of LEADERSHIP,"The author fails to recognize the relation of leaders to the structure of society (persons, families and bureaucracies) as well as all the general roles played within families (leader, manager, entrepreneur and apprentice). Leaders along with members of their families play all these roles with varying degrees of responsibility. While he does recognize that leaders exercise power, he goes on to highlite coercion which is only one and the least used of three tools of power and fails to identify the foundation of power.Finally his subtopics lacklogic and his case studies are exercises in management and not leadership. This introduction to leadership has a very limited scope without an apparent logic."
3,Par for the course,"Not up to Johnstons usual standards. In each story there did not seem to be any depth to the relationship then BAM, they're in love. I found myself skipping pages and moving on to the story. The book was ok, nothing great."
5,Loved this movie!,Very touching true story about the faith and commitment of several families as they served the natives of Ecuador. So sweet!
1,What u buy cheap will cost u lots,Hi i bought this webcam in brandsmart it cost me $20 when i got home i tried it everything was green so i thought of resarting my computer then i tried it again but nothing everything always came out black so plz dont waste $20 or $30 dollars on this!
5,Omgosh My First Cam,"I know it's embarressing but this is my first real cam. And it's awesome. My other cam wasn't actually a webcam. This webcam is awesome. It was blurry but I turned the focus on the lens and it was awesome. I can now have video conversations with my friends. The only problem is, my mouth moves slow when I see myself on the cam. But the lens can fix it. This was the best Christmas present ever!"
1,RUBBISH!,"I bought this [stuff] at Brandsmart and it has the worst picture quality I have ever observed. It refuses to accept any light source other than that of a star no further than 93 million miles. So forget about that new desk lamp you just got. I wish I could give this thing ZERO stars but that's just not an option. This crap gives truth to the old adage that you get what you pay for. ""New"" brands like Micro Innovations really give low-cost a bad name."
1,it is absulutely junk,"could not install it even after install windows xp drivers , manual is useless , pointless to read ... they put this product when most poeple have xp in their pcs and still they did not mention anything about win xp in their manual....plus it's more expensive than any logitech webcams which you dont have problem in installing them buy a logitech better"
1,Webcam Basic review.,May the manufacturing entity of this contrivance burst into flame and die a screaming death as Barry Manilow records are played at extreme decibles.
1,HOW do you uninstall this WebCam?,"I bought this Micro WebCam Basic. I installed the camera but it sitll does not work! It is my computer isn't reconizing it or something, but it does not work. I have WIndows 2000 and it says it's compatable. Please can anyone help me with this?"
4,Micro Innovations Webcam,"This webcam works great for it's moderate price. I do not demand too much of it, but for the purposes I have it was a good buy. I recommend this webcam for anyone who casually uses a webcam."
1,You Can Find Better,"I bought this cam because it was cheap. You have to have bright lighting to see much of anything on the screen. It took several tries to connect, and my XP tried to reject it during installation once. It also does to stay turned all the time when you turn the top on the base."
2,Not enough scent to annoy humans,"I purchased the product based on the reviews from others that it was strong enough to annoy humans. This has proven to be entirely untrue. If you hold the product up to your nose, it is repulsive. However, if you use this product on something like a tree, at 5' high, a human would have to be within 1 or 2 feet literally to be able to smell it at all.Since this product is designed to repel cats and dogs, and their olfactory senses are much more sensitive, it might work for cats and dogs (although my dog is not bothered by it).It DOES NOT work to repel humans from an area as some reviews have indicated, unless perhaps they are leaning ON the pole where you apply the product."
3,The book is OK,"In reading some of these reviews it would seem that someone has an agenda against Grand Master The'. To be so well written and not to support their arguments with any fact just makes their negative review worthless. The fact that they took the time to read the book and draw a conclusion says that the book is worth something. I would refer some in doubt to an article written by David Therof in Kung Fu Qigong magazine, March/April 2001. The article lends much credibility to the book and the Shaolin-do style.I would not recommend this book as a way to learn martial arts. It is not intended as such.I would recommend this book to anyone who is involved in or considering becoming involved in the Shaolin-do style of martial arts."
2,I agree with the reader from Mississippi,"I can't vouch for the reader from Mississippi, but I have read this book. While there are aspects of it which are entertaining, I too am troubled by many of its claims. The Japanese uniform and terminology aside, everything I have read suggests that the late Ark Wong was grandmaster of Shaolin kung fu. It seems odd that no mention of him is made here. Further, I have never seen any other mention of Su Kong Tai Jin or Ie Chang Ming, whom the authors claim to be past Shaolin grandmasters. While none of this necessarily invalidates this book, these problems do raise questions. I hope the authors write another book and give a more complete context for Shaolin do within the framework of better known Shaolin history."
1,how can a practitioner of Shaolin Do be objective?,"It is unfortunate that a number of the positive reviews that have been posted are not objective views of the book at all but instead are obviously reviews from brainwashed students recieving rank from one of the authors. The only objective view could come from a non-student. Hidden agenda? This is NOT the X-Files. Do you feel the government is after you? Do you call yourself ""Moulder"" at times? True martial artists are people. People do attack other styles. Many traditional Chinese martial artists HAVE visited Shaolin Do schools and I have yet to hear a POSTIVE review from ANY of them concerning Shaolin Do. If you enjoy REAL chinese martial arts, I suggest something OTHER than Shaolin Do."
1,This book is not very good,"I must agree with the reader who said this book is filled with contradictions. Traditional Shaolin systems don't, for example, use Japanese terminology or uniforms. Far better books on the Shaolin arts exist. Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming is an excellent introduction to the real thing. Dr. Yang supplements his books with video tapes which allow interested parties to actually see what the art is all about. This alone is a big plus."
1,Waste of time,"While it is an interesting read at times, there are too many problems with this book to be taken even with with a hint of seriousness."
1,Silly endeavour,"It's really a shame that 1 star is the minimum review. This one could really go lower than that. I'm not exactly sure where the author gets his history, but any respected author backs up his claims and I would like to see documented evidence from sources ""outside"" of shaolin-do on the following items: the existence of Su Kong Tai Jin, the association of the different styles listed with all the particular temples, the claims of knowing over 900 forms, the ability to master all of that in 10 years, and the list goes on. There's too much good stuff out there to spend time on this. I'm just sorry I did."
4,Shaolin-Do : Secrets from the Temple,"I just started training at a Shaolin-Do hall. I have several years in both Chinese Kenpo and Wing Chun, although I'm not an expert in either. This is a very strong system and has a great deal of depth. I have met the Master once and he is a very competent martial artist. Part of what makes martial arts interesting are the stories and the history. I don't think any of his claims or stories are unbelievable when they are viewed in the light of all other martial arts ""origons"". The training that is done at these schools will make a person stronger, quicker, and will build you into a good artist as well as a fighter. This system would also be of interest for people who want to see a variety of styles. You definately won't get bored.As for the book.... It is a good read and has good information in it. I don't think it is really ment to be a stand alone training manual. It is very good supplemental material, especially in regards to the internal arts."
1,This book can be judged by it's cover,"Very uninspiring and usless information. There is no practical information in this book and honestly, it was fairly nauseating to read."
1,Bad,"This book is bad, the 'facts' are bad, everything is bad. Read something else. I'm ashamed I paid money for this, I'm returning it today."
1,Shaolin Do is not what it claims,"This book might be something for Shaolin Do students to enjoy, but if you are looking for REAL information on the history of martial arts, (including Shaolin Do itself) you will not find it here. This book is a fabrication, just like the system's history itself. Granted, if you want to learn how to fight, I'm sure Shaolin Do will be just as effective as any other kickboxing school, or American Karate McDojo, but it's not a traditional martial art. Look into this for yourself, find outside sources, you will turn up a lot more truth than you will readin this."
1,How many ways can you say bad?,"Ok let's see, incorrect history, false unsupportable claims, delusions of grandeur, and on and on. It's too bad there are lots of people hungry for real knowledge and real Chinese arts that would fall for this."
1,A book of no-importance,"Well, after just finishing reading a friend's copy of this book, I have this to say about it, it's pure hogwash (pardon my redneck terminology). If one were to compare this 'work' with other books and that of history, it would almost be funny as to the innaccuracies contained therein. After having seen the author perform before (and being summarily unimpressed whatsoever) and knowing people that trained in it, I was interested in seeing the responses to the book on here. It is clear what the defining line is: All of the good reviews come from students of the art and/or the grandmaster, and all the bad reviews come from people outside the system. Obviously, being in the system does not allow for objectivity and leads to an almost cult like behaviour. This book is as one reviewer put it, only appropriate as a student manual for someone in the system. It doesn't contain any truthful or real information about real shaolin. Skip this one and go read something else."
1,Judge without knowing?,"Ok, a five star review from someone who asks, why judge without knowing? Well, I do know. I have experience with this system, under one of the author's students that has been ranked a master. It is a joke. Students leave all the time because they think its a hoax. If they say otherwise, they are denying the truth. The classes are no more demanding than other martial arts classes. Now this particular book is simply a manifesto promoting the author's ideas and claims. It really should be a student manual instead of a published book. It would work in that context, but when it is put out there alongside well written respected books and authors, it deserves every bit of scrutiny it gets. To put it simply, and there is no nice way to say it, this is a load of bunk. The author can no more back up these claims than I can prove the sky is green. While on the other hand, there is lots of real history out there that would say the author is wrong."
1,Inconsistent with Chinese history,"This is a fanciful playland, geared to those naive in martial arts. The author takes himself way too seriously. The 'facts' presented in here are not consistent with known history. And the claims are outrageous. A reader's money is much better spent on other works. I had no prior knowledge or experience with the author or this style but I have to say I can't believe people are still falling for frauds like this."
1,A fantasy world,"Sin The' may know some good stuff and may at one time have been proficient, but I, as well as many other people I know, have seen him perform personally and were left very unimpressed. His claims are far fetched and his current teachings consist of watching other people's videos and then copying it and producing it as his own. This book reflects all of that, it is a fantasy world that he is the ruler of and his students blindly follow him without question, never realizing there are real martial arts out there."
5,Excellent overview of an authentic Shaolin martial art,"If the reader from Mississipi had actually read the book he would have found the answer on page 10 as to why this system adopted the superficial Japanese name, belt ranking system and uniform."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I live in Kentucky and have met Mr. The and his estranged brother and many of their students. Folks....the man is a legend in his OWN mind. There are incident after incident of embellishments and malingering comments that have been made by The through the years. Mr. The is about one thing...and one thing only...his profit margin. His claims are laughable...his historical accounts hilarious. Unfortunately, he has quite a following of students in the Lexington area who seem to be suffering some form of mass delusion and brainwashing. Most of the Shaolin-Do students I have encountered are sorely lacking in true knowlege and skill...and it is a shame Sin The has been allowed to stay in business. So if you are planning on buying this book...treat it as a light comedy. It isn't worth much to you as anything else."
3,not what I ordered,"I ordered this ""unscented"" but what came was loaded with scent--and even labeled as scented.Reeks, to me, but I am not an aroma therapy person. Which is why I ordered unscented."
3,The New World Order Exposed,"""Interesting"" reading: Victor Torn makes very good points, though there are some points that make the reader feel as if ""that is too far fetched."" I can assure prospective readers you this, it is a page turner."
4,It's plain old Surge Strip,"Hey you!Yeah YOU!Why are you reading this review?This is your basic surge strip 6 outlet 4ft cord.-It's cheap-It works-It's white!Cons- This didn't come with 6 appliances it could be used forEinstein:""The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible."""
5,A credible account written by a distinguished historian,"I've been trying to educate myself on the Armenian-Turkish controversy and I have to say this book has really opened my eyes. Before reading the McCarthy book all I knew and heard were the ARmenian grievances and their one-sided story.This book is a guide, for those who'd like to see a fair handed analysis. No, Justin McCarthy is not a hired gun as some of the Armenian symphatizers have claimed here. Don't go out making ridiculous allegations against our Academia when what's said doesn't serve your cause! McCarthy is a damn good American professor who is interested in bringing clarity to a historical dispute that's been going on for far too long."
1,paid for handsomely propaganda,"Mr. McCarthy cannot be in any way considered to be a scholar when he accepts money (bribes) and awards from the very nation that he writes fiction about. How absurd of him to think that people are that dumb!Some of the awards bestowed upon him by the Parastate Of Turkey:Order of Merit of the Turkish Republic, conferred by the President of Turkey, 1998.Justin A. McCarthy, Honorary Doctorate, Sleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey, 2001."
1,The most prominent Armenian Genocide denier in the world,"Mr. Justin McCarthy is probably the most prominent denier of the Armenian Genocide. It is no secret that he officially works as an adviser to the turkish government and therefor entirely reflects the turkish denialist position in his works on the Armenian Genocide.Due to the fact that the denialist position of the turkish government today is nearly entirely based on McCarthy's works, he has become the most important figure in Turkey's denial campaign. He can therefor be considered the 'David Irving' of Turkish revisionism.This book is definitely a perfect example of historical revisionism and Genocide denial. It can only be recommended to readers who are interested in Turkey's denial-campagin and want to take a closer look at the denier's argumentation.For everyone who wants to get acquainted with the facts of the Armenian Genocide, there are plenty of reliable books on this issue written by various prominent european and american historians."
1,"Not scholarly, but excellent example of paid propaganda","(...)Serious scholars did not ""ingore"" this book. Yes it is a footnote used only to illustrate the polution of academia with paid propaganda, but it is a footnote nonetheless!Justin McCarthy's name now joins Fred Leuchter, David Irving, Robert Faurisson, Arthur Butz, Bradley Smith, Ditlieb Felderer and others in the denial industry.So even with inane pretence at scholarship McCarthy has managed note: He joins various deniers of mass murder, ethnic cleansing, etc on a very unfortunate list.A reader would be much better of consulting the immense bibliography at the US Holocaust museum which lays bare the lies McCaarthy and his ilk spout."
1,reversed!,"The only right thing about this book, is the date!between that dates,1821-1922 , Armenians were massacred by turks and kurds,There are many proofs.recently French government admitted that the Armenian genocide took place. this book says the opposite.It is like saying i can live without my brain and heart! if you think that is possible or believe that, then you can believe this book.There are even photos, taken by a german traveler, and these photos are availabe in many websites.In my opinion, the benefit of this book is that, like this, mr Justin McCarthy can sell more books(80-90 million Turks and kurds compared to 7 million armenians).Armenians were not the only Victims, hundreds of thousands greeks, bulgarians, lebanese,... were also massacred .This is just to mention few..."
1,McCarthy fails to examine the dynamics of ethnic cleansing,"Justin McCarthy fails to analyze the true dynamics of ethnic cleansing accurately. First, he has not arrived at an accurate definition of who Muslims were in the Ottoman Empire. Many groups such as the Druzes of Lebanon or the Shi'a Arabs of Iraq, or the Alevis of Anatolia and Syria existed on the fringes of Muslim society. Second, McCarthy fails to note that a significant proportion of the Muslim casualties he lists for the wars of 1821 to 1922 were actually caused by the Ottoman army, not by ""Christian"" rebels or aggressors. Finally, McCarthy did not cite Ottoman Turkish sources for his statistics in any great abundance, relying mostly upon European diplomatic accounts. In the end, his attempt to speak for ""Muslims"" as victims was a clumsy and inept attempt to avoid placing blame upon the Ottoman state."
4,keeps you safe from surprises,"my sister is the one who used this product and has been using it way before she had her 1st child and has been a loyal customer since. safe, easy to apply, and gets the job done."
5,Thanks,This was amazing that i got this book on time. The book is new like untouched even though it was said used book. Good job!! I thank you.
3,Handy but not Dandy,I have had this item long ago. The quality is not as good as before - but what's new with that anymore? It does work but just not as well as the ones I've had before. I don't discredit it at all for the price paid.
2,More like a textbook.....,I purchased the book Cousins: A Unique and Powerful Bond in early April of 2011. I have a family reunion with some of my cousins coming up and I wanted to see if this book would be interesting enough to buy extra copies for the cousins. It reads and is formatted more like a textbook on the subject of cousin relationships in families. It could have been layed out differently with photos (of the author's) or other people's cousins to break up the text within the book.I purchased two copies (on blind faith) and I'm glad I didn't purchase more than two copies of Johanna Garfield's book.Cousins: A Unique and Powerful BondThis just goes to show you-- Caveat Emptor (Let the buyer beware)
3,Kinda Moody,"I have mixed feelings about this book. There are many good things in it, but it does not seem like it goes far enough. It leaves you wanting more."
3,Getting lost in the jungle,Everyone should read this book. It is true on many aspects; yet I am a believer that God sees us as we can be not as we are. In today's world the church needs to be in the community and seeing the good in everyone. I have seen the church judge and that is God purpose.
3,Encouragement out of the past.,"Quotations have been numerous from the lips of D. L. Moody. No doubt, God had His hand on Moody long before he became the great preacher and evangelist of his day. Truth, when preached by anyone, is worthy of an audience. He might not influence many today, but God used him in a mighty way in his time. Hopefully, we, today, can be as usable in our time."
5,Timely insight into the work of the Holy Spirit,"Even though this work was written years ago, it has such depth and relevance for our lives today. Has great worth, power and substance. For everyone who wants to allow the third person of the Trinity His rightful place in helping us to live our lives to the fullest as God intended."
4,Very Informative,"While The Culture of Fear has opened my eyes and made me become more aware of the methods used by mass media to pump us full of fear, there were a few things in Glassner's book that I did not agree with, but the book did a very good job in convincing with very detailed endnotes citing every source that Glassner spoke of. All-in-all I thought it was a good book, but it just didn't grasp me like other books."
2,Bad news Vs. Other Bad news,"This book provides us with clear and and easy to understand examples of how the media helped enflame or even create some of the fears in our society. I thuroughly enjoyed that aspect of it.Unfortunately for me, the book also contains various suggestions as to what we really should be affraid of. It was baffling to me that after making such a great case for mistrusting the media's reporting, the author then goes on to use similar methods he criticized others for, to prove his own arguments.There is a solid 100 pages of excellent, inquisititive writing. Regretfully, this book is over 200 pages long - that is why I had to give it two stars instead of four. (If you believe the numbers I gave you above - you Really need to read this book.)"
2,Contradicts itself,"The weird thing about this book is that the author explains how ""fear mongers"" use the media to mislead the public and thus promote their alarmingly conservative agenda. He then does an about-face and uses the EXACT SAME TECHNIQUES to explain why we should fear those things that liberals find scary.As someone who isn't overly political, I found this book to be more silly (insofar as it contradicts itself) than intolerable."
2,"Some goods sections, others full of rant...","Having had to read this book for my college sociology class, I admit this would not have been the first book I would have picked up on my own. It has several good points, such as how the media tends to perpetuate fears. However, several sections left me with the feeling that the purpose of this book was to unleash some pent up frustration by the author, consequently making this book full of rant. As the line, Its the Guns, stupid...well, by characterizing the issues of suicide or teen school shooters, as a problem with our gun policy, trivilizes the issues- there is something clearly wrong with an individual who would go shooting around some of his classmates-and to blame it on the guns, negates this fact. And remember Columbine, they didn't just use guns. Maybe school shootings aren't likely, but tell that to the parents who have lost their children's due to these random acts of violence."
4,don't review if you can't spell,"I just want readers to know that their reviews are crippled when they don't know the difference between ""right"" and ""write."""
3,More hype...,"Not quite the ""eye opener"" I thought it would be. Mr. Glassner plainly puts his ducks in a row, however, in some instances he is as guilty of misinformation as the media he rails against.In his example of Gulf War Syndrome - though it may be true that the precise cause of the illness has not been identified - the whole point of media attention on our veterans was that they were being denied benefits from the government they faithfully served. A point the author neglected to mention.At length, the book made me consider ""trust."" There are too many instances of people or organizations - scientist are by no means excluded - acting in their own self-interest, whatever it may be [selling books, selling ad space, selling products, or obtaining research funding].The critical point is to gather your information from multiple sources - more than just different network news channels - and to be leery of ""professionals"" pandering to emotions."
4,Sleep easy...,"One knows to always take something with a grain of salt, but I never knew how big a grain it should be until marvelling at the level of detail and research the author put into this book. Although the overriding conclusions at the end of the book were themselves a bit of a reach and I didn't necessarily agree with them, the facts speak for themselves.Reading this has made me immune to the fear mongering we experience everyday from the media, commercials and politicians. Now that my eyes (and ears) are open to these fear inducing ""tricks"", it is absolutely astounding how pervasive their use is--so much so I regularly laugh at the evening news and perscription drug commercials!Buy the book and rest easy."
4,The truth is out there!,"The Culture of Fear is a book that gives the reader the truth about how the media manipulates society in order to make more customers. It also tells how governments use violence as a means of being elected to office. When I read articles in the Newspaper I now reconsider if what I am reading is the truth. You have a better chance of being hit by lightning than being in a plane crash. When you get off a plane the pilot says, "" the safest part of your travel is over"". Barry Glassner depicts the way society is tortured with the dishonesty from every single organization out there. Fear is used make money, and the Culture of fear is used to make people aware of what is really out there. Crime, Drugs, Minorities, teen moms, are some of the many topics which Glassner is able to untangle and give actual number and ratios. What the people want in the reality of these things, and Barry give precise, exact, and genuine answer for our problems."
2,Hit & miss,"Glassner has an interesting premise and much of the book is well written and thoroughly researched. However, he does seem to fall into his own trap sometimes, citing a number of things that Americans should fear instead of the bogeymen that he cites. In many of these instances, he provides no supporting data and gives somewhat nonsensical conclusions. The book also jumps around a lot from topic to topic and never seems to tie everything together at the end--as if you were reading a collection of articles with the same theme but on different topics. Overall, the book is fairly well conceived but poorly executed and ultimately unconvincing."
1,Buy the origianl book by Frank Furedi if you are interested,"If you are interested in this topic, buy Frank Furedi's book also entitled the Culture of Fear (1997). Furedi's book covers virtually of the same topics and you don't have to endure the bad jokes and excessive liberal, left-wing bias of Mr. Glassner. (It is pretty strange that Glassner picks the same topics and the same title as Furedi two years have Furedi's book. Glassner apparently doesn't have enough imagination to come up with his own book idea.) If you are interested in a factual discussion of the costs and benefits of gun ownership, buy the book by John Lott.Glassner's book just over does it on political feelings and facts that are too superficial. I agree with the review from The Economist magazine reprinted below by the person from Philadelphia."
5,great jury reading,"Spent hours waiting for jury duty but the time went by so quickly while reading this important book. It really makes you question the way the media and politicians depict so many events and ""facts"" and the ways they distort them."
1,The culture of blame and polarization; Glassner's thinly veiled accusations,"This book is a powerful contribution to the atmosphere of shrill and hostile dialog typically conducted by both the far left and the far right. Glassners rhetoric of accusation and blame and his insistence on demonizing those who oppose his views, can do no one any good. Such polarization - to the left or the right - focuses on ""fixing the blame"" rather than ""fixing the problem."" This is perhaps the single biggest crisis in American politics today.Further, Glassner's willingness to speak out on topics where he has no experience (e.g. the economy, international trade, and international security) displays a level of hubris that I can only admire from afar."
4,Bowling for Columbine is Better,"The PBS show ""Bowling for Columbine"" is better and available on DVD. This book is very similar in many ways. Although better organized, it sheds little real additional information. If you prefer reading, this might be the approach for you. Even so, consider the show first and then read this."
1,He has some misplaced fears of his own.,"Glassner did a fine job of attacking the numbers and statistics in order to dispel our irrational fears. But while he was at it he did suggest some things we should fear, one of them, guns. It doesn't make sense to me that we should fear an inanimate object but not the person who would use it with ill intent. I just couldn't get past that and so the rest of the book had little credibility."
2,Obvious agenda,"In the first 56 pages, the author advocates the gun restriction, gun bans, and gun confiscation. Each issue all boils down to the same problem for this author, guns. I am saddened to see that in the reviews present on the Amazon page up front and center, this fact is not presented. The author makes no real discussion of the legality, constitutionality, or feasability of his lust to rid the world of firearms, just takes his pot-shots and runs."
2,Don't buy this book,"This might have been a good book before Sept. 11, but now it completely lost sense because it refers to events previous to the new American way of looking at terrorism and etc.I'm very angry I bought the book at an airport store at $ 15.95, then read and what the author said didn't make much sense, then I discovered an hour later that the book was writen previously to Sept 11. They shouldn't sell books totally outdated like this. Now I can't even sell it because there are hundreds are less than $5 dollars. I won't go to ship the book for that amount LOL"
2,Um...,"True, I do have to admit that Mr. Glassner provides more than enough sources form which he has researched for this book but that wasn't enough to win me over. I do agree that all the subjects that he brought up were valid, but he had no knew way of saying that ""This is something that shouldn't be feared."" And his tone came off as extremely biased to me. And I found that I could not sit and read his book for too long without getting bored. Since this was for a sociology class I had to endure reading his reiterations why everything in this world that is feared shouldn't be. This entire book could have been summed up in a two page listing of all the different subjects that are feared for the wrong reasons."
2,Very Uneven Book,"This is really two different books. When it comes to exposing the silly fears that are pushed on us through the media, Glassner does a reasonable job, though I frequently wished that he had more concrete facts. The ""other book"" is when Glassner pushes his own fears, and I found this part as bad as those that he attacks. These discussions are weak and filled with more fears than facts. The first type of discussion fortunately involves much more of the book than the second one, but it significantly detracts from the overall quality of the effort.There are other similar books (indeed strangely enough some with the exact same title and same list of fears) that do at least as good of a job. I had thought that this might serve as a starting point for some class discussions, but the material is too thin for that purpose."
3,Shining a Light on Shady Journalism,"This book is somewhat of an eye opener as it reveals a lot of the hidden truths of contemporary journalism. This isn't a revalation for most people, but the statistical evidence that it readily offers for commonplace examples keep it interesting. Despite my interest in the topic, this book didn't really hook me like I thought it would. For me it grew a bit tiresome and drawn out. Not what I expected, but I don't regret reading it either."
1,Disappointing -- Uninspired and Hypocritical,"I had heard pretty good things about this book but was disappointed in it (and actually gave up on it with about 60 pages to go.) The chapters each cover different subjects but they all are making the same point: media plays up a new fear periodically by bending statistics and using sensationalized reporting. Even with new subjects as examples, the theme was repetitive with no new insights.Also, the author does have his own pet fear: he is afraid of guns. And he is willing to use the same type of incomplete (and/or discredited) statistics he accuses media of using in other subjects in an attempt to inspire his fear in readers."
5,Best book I've read in years.,"I was cruising the 'net while watching the news last month and came across various references to The Culture of Fear. Then I read the comments on Amazon and got really intrigued. Here's the bottom line, folks: the gun nuts who have sent negative comments are totally off the mark (pun intended). First off, Glassner is right about what he says about guns, and he provides loads of evidence. Second off, talk about guns takes up maybe 2% of the book! If you want to know what this brilliant book is REALLY about, read the subtitles (why Americans are afraid of the wrong things, like road rage, crime, kids, and so forth). I learned more about the current state of American society from this book than from a year's worth of newspapapers-- which The Culture of Fear put in a whole new perspective anyway."
5,Fascinating and Wonderfully-Written,This is a wonderful expose of the profiteers of fear in our society
5,"America - you are a great nation, so don't be afraid!","One of the reasons that 9/11 happened is that terrorists all over the world thought that the USA was too frightened to retaliate in strength. They now know differently of course! But books like this show that the USA, the mightiest nation on earth, is still too scared of too many things - and quite needlessly! You CAN go on that vacation in California, England, wherever - you won't die! Most people still love the USA! Keep living, America! The rest of the world needs you, as this book makes clear. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)"
3,Excellent but ill-conceived,"This book is a most thorough and informative investigation of modern fears -- but I feel that it is a dis-service to Americans in this day and age to focus even more on the issue of fear; which is SOOOOO destructive and counterproductive. I much prefer the work of authors such as Tony Robbins, Napoleon Hill, and Clint Arthur, who focus on positive aspects of living instead of the negatives. In particular, Clint's ""9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power"" is a superb example of how concentrating on positive influences can have a beneficial impact on life."
2,Just another liberal rant,"Glassner is just another liberal, refusing to acknowledge American cultural and world realities. Your first tip off should be his status as a sociology (race and class-baiting indoctrination) professor at a left-coast university. The leap to praising Obama in the last chapter is expected, and he doesn't disappoint. This indoctrinator of our impressionable youth refuses, like so many other liberals, to shine the light on evil and socially damaging influences."
1,another boring anti-gun rant,"This book is yet another boring rant by an anti-gun PC telling us how we should think. What arrogance. These guys seem to think that in their enlightened PC minds they have the secrets to the universe. If you want to fear something, fear the guys who write these useless screeds - they are fascists. Good riddance to a worthless read."
1,He is a victim of what he rights about (he's afraid of guns),Could not finish a book about how we are afraid of all these things for no reason when he puts out misinformation and engages in the very behavior he critisizes.
4,Why news channels in the US are a joke,"Whatever the author discusses has been the subject of numerous books and movies. So its not earth-shattering in that respect.Crux of the book is that a few powerhouses controlling the media filter out just enough information to misguide the general public. The media might not be lying all the time but not telling the complete truth either. Can the media be resposible for mass hysteria and propaganda? Can the media control thoughts of general population? If you are unsure of the answer, you'd be startled to find out. It resonates what Noam Chomsky says in his Manufacturing Consent documentary.Although the book is not a bad read, but if you know all this, you can simply skip it. If you want proof then go ahead and get this book. If you like it, I suggest you rent out Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent DVD too."
2,The replacement of an Agenda,"Very simple. This is a good book, but the author ruins it by replacing his own anti-gun agenda with the media. Is true we worry about the wrong things, but this man shouldn't have the right to tell us what to be afraid of any more than other entities. Glassner doesn't want to eliminate the ability of the mass media or ideologues to tell us how to think, he just wants their job...."
4,Great game for small children,"I've read the other reviews and if you are considering purchasing this game for a small child, I would not hesitate. I bought this game for my 5 year old son on his birthday and it is the only game he plays on a regular basis. It was easy for him to learn, and he has a blast playing it. My 7 year old daughter also enjoys playing it. This is a wonderful game for small children. It is a great game to promote critical thinking and teaches children to plan ahead. Yes, it does have to ""load"" after every activity, but this has never bothered my son. The benefits of this game far outweigh any negatives that were mentioned in the other reviews. :)"
2,A Disappointment,"My brother got this for his birthday, and he was not fond of it. I'm not either. It has quite a lot of flaws. For one, thereis absolutely no racing. It's soap box racing, beat the fastest time, get the most items. Another thing,it's way tooshort. Another, Arthur sounds much different. And for the last, Arthur is annoying at certain times. Do yourselfa favor and save your money."
1,Crap,"This shuffler didn't work at all. Only one side turned. The other side's shuffle feeder was below the surface of the card table, so it couldn't feed cards at all. Very sloppy workmanship and very cheap parts all around."
5,Great Tutor,Casino Verite Blackjack Card Counting Game Software Version 5 is a great tutor for someone wanting to learn how to really play blackjack. I was very impressed with how detailed the tutorial is. The software is expensive but worth it.
1,cell phone case w/ clip,Do not waste your money on this product. The reason we bought it was because the clip of the original case that we bought w/ the phone broke after 3 years. The new one broke within 5 days. It is a piece of junk!
2,Why should I wait 4 months for a magazine subscription ?,I ordered this subscription in December (in time for snowmobile season). I was told I would not see a magazine until April. Makes no sense to me. Why do i want to read about snowmobiles after winter is over ?
5,where's the mac?,to the record company-where is the most touching song from the whole movie:fleetwood mac's LANDSLIDE? other than that not a bad collection of artists and titles and a phenomenal movie.
4,"A pretty good, but not exceptional, CD","This CD, in my opinion, had some good, solid tunes. Most of the songs from the movie were there, such as ""Hey Now Now"", the song played when Charlie and his dad (the snowman) sled down the hill away from the bullies. However, one song is missing from the collection. The song played when Charlie builds the snowman (who ends up to be his dad), is, in my view, a very emotional and wonderful song. I was disappointed to find that it was missing from this CD. I even tried to find out the name and author of the song, but I didn't come up with any results. Nonetheless, unless you are dying to hear that song like I am, you should buy this CD. For those of you who enjoyed the movie, it is definitely worth the money."
3,Missing fleetwood mac song,Sad that this soundtrack is missing the Fleetwood Mac song that creates such a sad moment in the film.what happened here no licening availible
4,Great soundtrack from a great movie,"I thought this movie was really good, corny...but good. Part of what made it so good was the music. My favorites are You Were There, Hey Now Now and the two tunes that Michael Keaton sings. He is a pretty damn good blues singer. I wish he would so some other stuff."
1,FAKE RED VINEGAR,Read the ingredients. FD & C Red #40. No where does it say rice vinegar. I wouldn't serve this to Hitler. Another Chinese ripoff
4,Nice film collection,"If you are a Stevie Wonder fan and don't want to shell out a ton of money for a box set, you NEED this just for ""If Ever"", a song Stevie wrote especially for John Denver ; -)"
2,average,most of this material is lacking.what in the world was D'angelo thinking? Heaven must be like this is a classic by the Ohio Players.he makes it sound simple& boring.Janet Jackson sounds her usual out of tune self.patchwork quilt is the best cut by Sweet Honey in the rock.this could&should have been way better.
4,Fats At His Best.,If you love Fats Waller then this is a must. On this almost forgotten recording Fats plays organ on most of the tracks and sings. He also accompanies Adelaide Hall on three tracks which is a real bonus. But the suite which celebrates London and his memories of it expressed through his playing this a real gem.
3,Pretty good bag,"This is a pretty good bag, sturdy and well made. I was disappointed though, with the closed cell dividers. I can't figure out exactly how to use them to effectively cradle the camera without wasting space. My digital SLR fits well if laid on its side, but the extra compartments will hold only one set of batteries with charger in the front compartment - the side ""fishnet"" compartments are too small for this purpose and seem too insecure for anything valuable."
3,"Nice bag, but small & inconvenient","the E-10 will not fit without bulging the top of the bag.There is about enough space for the equivalent of 4-6 AA batteries behind padded partitions on each side of the lens. There is also a small zippered front pouch.The top is secured by a double zipper, an overlapping 1-inch rain flap around all three sides, and a large front flap with a snap buckle. All combine to make it rain resistent, but difficult to get into easily. Doesn't close well with only the snap buckle for temporary use.All in all, this is not a very convenient bag to use. It is well-constructed and sturdy."
1,$1.50/minute,"I spent so much time trying to find just the right DVD that I didn't even notice it was 12 minutes long - I didn't even think anyone would sell a 12 min long DVD for this price, so I guess I didn't think to look at the length... that's ok, I learned from this & we all got a good laugh when we were sitting in front of the TV all excited & prepared to learn a lot about Howard Hughes, it started & boom, it was over.... too bad I gave it as a gift, I was a little embarassing!"
3,Warning! Not the radio hits,"I usually love almost all of these songs, but I was definitely thrown the first time because these are not the radio versions. Songs were recorded specifically for this cd, and I believe that almost all of the versions are not as good. (Often I do enjoy live recordings, but not in this case.) Generally, the songs I liked were the ones that did sound the most like the radio hits. In some instances, the voices did not sound as rich, there was laughter by one of the band members, etc.Perhaps it would grow on me, but for now, I'm disappointed."
4,It's okay,"I bought this for my little brother and he seems to like it. It arrived in good time, The only complaint I had was that it said it was new but it was not sealed on arrival. The disc however was in perfect shape so no complaints about that."
2,Photo misleading,"Please don't make the same mistake I did. The picture is completely misleading, this is just for the top piece. I was really surprised when I got home and saw the box was so small. The seller should really represent the item in a better way, or have in the description that this is for the top piece only. I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the entire set. Guess I should have gone to the website for MTM instead of just looking for maintenance kits on amazon. Please don't let my mistake be your."
1,Almost Fraud,I wish I had read the other reviews - this product appears to to purposefully falsely advertised by the pictures. It is only the small top portion and probably a fair price would be $7 to $10. There is NO handle and unless you spend another $45 or so you have a very limited use flat mount for a gun. The compartments will hold little of practical value for cleaning purposes.
5,mtm rifle/shotgun stand,Item fits my needs perfectly. It is being used for cleaning of rifles. Very handy due to portability. Can be used at rilfe range or at home.
5,Great!!,This is well built and will be perfect for taking out to the range. Plenty of space and configurations to make this a perfect box. I have owned the MTM Bow Hunters Box (almost the same thing) and have been using it without a problem for 18 years!!
1,Dangerous,Be very careful when doing this dvd. I tore my calf muscle while doing this dvd. The injury occured over 2 months ago and I am still having trouble with my calf.
4,"Decent workout, but nowhere near the intensity I expected","This workout is nowhere near the intensity level I was expecting given Gin's introduction and the majority of the reviews. I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser and I regularly work out with videos by Cathe, Kelly Coffey-Meyer, Jari Love, etc. A few of the segments in Simply Interval got fairly intense, but there was SO much downtime in between. For many segments, however, my heart rate simply didn't get up to where I'd have expected it to be, given Gin's introduction. Frankly, I'm a bit mystified by some of the reviews claiming that this is ""one of the most intense step videos on the market."" All that said, I keep the DVD in my rotation for days when I'm looking for a lighter cardio workout with no-brainer footwork."
4,Mixed feelings on Day of the Warrior.,"This is movie has the worst acting I've ever seen. So bad that it is actually funny. If you want to get a kick out of bad acting, get this movie."
4,Shae Marks Is HOT!,"Yes! This movie contains absolutely no plot, okay, okay... It does... But we see these kinda movies for the wonderful, sexy babes, not the plot, hehheh. Shae Marks looks incredibly yummy on this flick, But I wish they would have gave her more than 2 nude scenes! BOO the Director! I would like to end this review by saying... Shae Marks has some luscious looking breasts & some yummy, mouth-watering buns!"
2,Too shrill and hysterical,"As director of an organization concerned with medical error, I'm acutely aware of the hazards. There is some useful information in this book, but too much of the time it is over-the-top. The author latches onto dubious and lurid sources; anything that will bolster her thesis, no matter how questionable. It is impossible for the typical reader to sort out the credible information from the nonsense. The book is so extreme that it tends to discredit the effort to inform consumers about medical risks."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"This product arrived to my home in a box that was completely torn up. I was so concerned it was missing items I took pictures of it. I believe it to be missing top caps on the shower system. However, worse than the way it arrived was that the hinge system wasn't cut correctly. My handyman had to fix the spacing on the system. I received a call from the distributor about my concerns and I was promised they would try to find me some caps for the top of the system as it looks unfinished. I have received nothing. I think the door is poor quality and I was completely disappointed. If this was a local company they would be receiving this door back."
1,Less than standard/Junk,"This product is of poor construction. The fabricated sides are lightweight and do not support a firm installation. If the door is accidentally moved past 90 degrees it warps out of the wall and bends the support/screws. Further like the other comment there are NO end caps for the top of the unit thus an unfinished look and due to the sharp edges leaves opportunity for cutting ones self, snagging a towel draped over the top.Avoid the unit and buy a more well constructed door."
3,Use to clean up a house for sale,"Looks fine and is 1/3 the cost of other out there. Not very strong or modern, but it cleaned up a shower area in a house for sale for not a lot of money"
5,what' s with the price?????,"This is the best cocoa I've ever had!! But seriously, what is up with that price??? 8.00/ box is ridiculous considering it's $1.50 @ your local wally world store!!"
3,"Good Music, Cheesy Lyrics","I gave this album 3 stars because musically I thought that it was very good, but because of the cheesiness of the lyrics I had to rate it lower. While listening I could definitley hear their influence on one Bay Area Thrash band in particular. That would be Testament. It is what it is though."
2,For those who've never owned Angel Witch,"As a side note, for those of you that are Angel Witch fans then I respect your fondness for the band. This review is for those who may have heard of the band, but never listened to them.Instrumentally, its very good, but the vocals are very weak. The liner notes mention that its a wonder why the band didn't make it big like Iron Maiden or Def Leppard, but this band isn't in the same class. If you're a fan of NWOBHM and want to sample all of what the genre has to offer then by all means buy it. I recommend though that you first sample other bands from this time period such as Maiden, Saxon, and UFO."
3,Not bad,"The album reminded me of Iron Maiden mostly. I would just get the first Iron Maiden album instead of this one, they seem somewhat copies of one another at times. The whole atmosphere of the strange world vibe and how the first Iron Maiden Iron Maiden album expresses it is truly classic to me. Loser is a song that stands out in my mind and so does the first song on the album. I liked the music but find the words sung very irritating, even though I like how he expresses his voice."
4,Enjoyed It,I enjoyed Angel Witch s CD very much. All songs were good Hard Rockin' tunes... I recommend it to anyone who is a Rock n' Roll Fan...
3,Credible Carmen from The Met.,"This video is second to the movie with Placido and Julia as far as enjoying the opera goes. Sam Ramey and Leona Mitchell do outshine the two principals of Baltsa and Carreras who are credible performers but certainly not thrilling. Jose was having difficulty, as usual, trying make his instrument heard in that big house, shaking like a wet puppy from the effort. Trying hard but always straining, making it a video best for his fans. I've never really cared for Agnes much and she didn't change my mind here either. Have this on LD and feel it is worth having in my collection as I liked the production which is gone now. The other videos of Ewing, Covent Garden and Bumbry's version are also OK but the movie is still my favorite."
3,There are better versions,"I ordered this DVD and I am so disappointed in it that I have not been inclined to watch any of my collection of about 15 operas on DVD. I was attracted to this because Carreras was the tenor, and I have so many operas featuring Placido Domingo. The version, with Carreras, is very amateurish. I can't believe this was presented at the Metropolitan, which I think is the information given. I am now in the process of ordering the Domingo version, and hope it will be more to my satisfacition. It took me a long time to add Carmen to my collection. Because of its popularity,I have seen it so many times. Now, I am once more interested in watching it again - a version I can appreciate."
5,"Crisp video, fine staging, excellent performance","Agnes Baltsa really steals the show with a seductive, passionate Carmen, and Ramey is phenomenal as Escamillo as well. Carreras is appropriately tortured as Don Jose with an excellent performance. The video quality of _Carmen_ is slightly better than the other (excellent) DG DVD releases. Of course, the uncompressed audio is superb as well, and James Levine can do little wrong with the NYP.This is a wonderful disc!"
3,Quanity over quality?,"Now i would like to start by saying these bulbs are bright and look great, they are easily what i expected.The problem is that so far i have gone through two pairs of these, both had the same problem: one (not the same) low beam burnt out within maybe a week of install.(this time i got pulled over for it)The amazon return support was easy to get through and shipping was prompt. Perhaps its just my car, i can't say for sure right now.I would recommend these bulbs to anyone looking for what is advertised...but maybe get a second pair."
5,Canadian Buyer and very impressed,"Saved money, product was just as described and shipping was bang on. Canadian buyer so i went out on the limb a bit and was not disappointed. Would purchase again without hesitation."
3,Marginal,"Installed these bulbs in my old Volvo 740 to try and improve the nighttime driving experience. The Volvo's headlights focus a wide pattern, but not very deep. The PIAA lamps did marginally better than the standard GE or Sylvania bulbs, but given the price differential I really don't think it was worth the money. They are quality products and have not burned out prematurely, at least not yet (two months). Maybe these would have done better in a different car?"
2,Disappintment,"After waiting for the realse of the newest edition of Propinball, we were sadly disappointed. We cannot figure out a rhyme or reason to the game even after trying to read the manual that comes with it. Table seems to inherently lean towards the right hand side of the screen, making for a lot of lost balls. Video screen is smaller, scoring is low, and although very good in the graphics department, lacks in user fun. This looks more like a first or second attempt instead of the fourth. If you enjoy decent graphics its a good buy... otherwise don't waste your money."
5,She sounds glorious...,"It's remarkable that Anita O'day at her age still sounds as sensual and her phrasing so clear and jazzy, she just keeps getting beeter with age. This is as good as any(if not better)record she's made for Verve. Good music..."
5,Lord Of The Rings,"This is a great book about the artwork of ""The Two Towers"" part of ""The Lord of the Rings"" that one will enjoy reading over and over again."
3,two of a kind,"It seems useful to point out that this album seems to be a reissue ofWell, Well, Cornelius, originally released in 1996. The product descriptions and reviews for neither of these releases seems to acknowledge this. It would be nice to know if there is any appreciable difference in quality between the original and this re-mastered, re-titled, and re-packaged version."
1,Disappointing!,"As a Mark Twain fan, I ordered this book on blind faith. It turned out that the best part of this volume was the introduction by the editor explaining why most of Mark Twain's travel books aren't very good. Indeed while I have read ""Roughing It"" a couple of times and enjoyed ""Life on the Mississippi,"" I found Twain's other travel books, such as ""Innocents Abroad,"" unreadable. I had hopes that this volume contained gems that had been mined from Twain's otherwise intractable travel volumes. Alas, this is not the case. This book only demonstrates further that most of Twain's travel writing isn't very good. Save your money for other Twain books, such as ""Huckleberry Finn"" or his ""Autobiography,"" that have stood the test of time."
5,"GREAT BOOK, Thank you KURT!","I am a twenty years old poet from Massachusets. Kurt's book ""Facets of love"" is like a revlation to me. Here is my little thank you to this great poet:Kurt, you bridge the gap 'tween what is your ageand what we hope and scramble to make our own.The emotions are the same,but you convey themwith much more grace.With your style you bridge the gapbetween the form-filled writingsof some four hundred years agoand the free flowing,soon to be chaotic verseof the approachingtwenty first century.You bridge the gapand you do itso damn' well!Thank you!"
5,Funny and Creative Book Series!!!,I love these What ?? Can't Do books and so does my 18 month old. He actually brings them to me to read to him.The illustrations are great and the words are so true and endearing. I have almost all the books in the series.
2,Just candy as promised,"I got this for a friend. It is just the candy as described. Junk food you do not need, so don't order it."
1,Not if you want a good drink.,"I don't think I found a single accurate recipe in this book. Club soda in a Negroni and a Singapore Sling? WHAT?You're much better off picking up Gary Regan's ""The Joy of Mixology"" or Dale DeGroff's ""Craft of the Cocktail"" for a beginner's book that'll teach you something useful."
4,bar companion,"professionnal and handy, his what's your poison section give you a quick base of all the important alcohol to know."
2,No Beer Information,"As a book that has the title ""... Bartender's Handbook"" you might expect it to have some information about beer. I understand it's a cocktail book. That's fine. In addition to spirits, it does have quite a bit of basic information about wine, but absolutely nothing about beer. I mean nothing... at all. Of course beer is a large subject (as is wine) and there are many books to delve into the topic. It just strikes me that if you're going to include wine, you would include beer. I think it's a grave omission."
2,"Very suspenseful in parts, but otherwise boring & silly","The novel starts well--five stars. It follows with lots of padding--pretentious stuff not relevant to the thriller stuff such as lots of erotic stuff and padding, padding, padding. It loses one star per 100 pages. The final portion becomes a page turner but with still occasional padding. End result: two stars out of five."
1,BEWARE IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE,"I tried this product on a day when my eyes were slightly puffy. Right away the skin on my upper lid began stinging. When I removed the eyepad my eyes wre twice as puffy, and remained so for a few days. It might have been something else, but given the timing, I won't be using this producr again."
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"The Talika Eye Decompress pads work so well. I haven't been able to find anything better in the market. I used to buy them from Space NK in Bloomingdale's, but they haven't gotten a new shipment of these for nearly a year."
5,Amazing deal,We replaced an existing fan with this one and I was concerned when I ordered it that it would be cheaply made. I was pleasantly suprised when I received it that it actually looked quite good. Installation was relatively easy and it works like a charm.
5,"Nice big, secure bag","The bag has nice, deep slots, about 1000 compartments and pockets, and a thick, durable flap that goes over the opening for extra security. It's a terrific, classy looking bag that appears to be durable, comfortable, and very convenient."
4,Perfect little storage bench,Easy to put together. Just a little worried about wear and tear from putting heavy backpacks/computer bags inside the cubbies will gash up the wood.
1,"poor quality housing, but a good deal afterall","I experienced the same problem as J. Stilwell. once I connected the machine, water was leaking all over the place, the ""machine water inlet"" was broken in half. I went on line to check if parts are available for this unit, but this particular model does not seem to exist on the powerwasher website. I have sent them a message......They replied really fast and told me that they would replace the broken part at no charge. I received the part within a week.(good service!!!) Its performance is pretty good for a pressurewasher of this price. and it comes with lots of accessories.Not a bad deal afterall. (I (re)-rate this Item 4 stars)"
4,Very good for small jobs,"Easy to use but a novice will have a lot of problems with the sparse directions. The big disappointment is the dispenser for the cleaning fluids. First, it does not integrate with the wand so each time you want to dispense you must disconnect the dispenser and attach the wand, then remove the wand and reattach the dispenser. Second, the dispenser pressure is limited to 110psi which means to get cleaner fluid very high on a wall you must use a ladder. Also, it means you can't clean while you apply cleaner-you must disconnect the dispense and attach the wand to get any pressure. Otherwise, it is worth $80 for small jobs around the house."
5,Best Power Washer,I bought this for my husband for xmas. He has used it so much as well as all of our family members. It is a work horse and has so many attachments that it was WELL worth the money. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a reasonably priced pressure washer that does a great job around the house.
4,Great for decks and cars,"This is my first power washer and it seems to work pretty well compared to some other brands that my father has in his garage. I got tired of borrowing his, so I got this one last year. Have used it on my deck and cars. Has worked well. Could use a little more pressure from the water spickey to work effectively; but I blame that on our local water pressure. Good unit for the price."
3,PRESSURE WASHER,"At first I loved this product, then had several issues with broken ends, and power washer end that failed to work. However, the customer service from the manufacturer is outstanding. All items and issues that I have had have been handled free of charge. That makes it good. I use this primarily for washing out automobiles and it does a good job. I would recommend this for someone doing light work not heavy duty use."
2,Better than a hose,"It's better than a hose but nothing special, the worst stains you will still have to scrub before using to get them away. As many of the parts are plastic they are easily broke, the part that attaches to the hose snapped on my second use so you really need to make sure there is no tension on the machine when moving it. Support was good and I got a replacement part without much hassle."
5,the grey fox soundtrack cd,"This cd arrived promptly and in new condition...only wish it was less expensive due to purchase because of rarity,etc in the U.S."
1,What is this!,"I gave it one star, because there's only one star on the CD I care to hear, and that's Ms. Jane. Hey Jane baby! Make a CD, I'll buy it! ;)"
2,Aptly titled,"In the DVD/movie, the songs and orchestration are overwhelming. Without the video, however, the CD is commonplace, a real disappointment reminiscent of bad 40's and 50's recordings. Therefore, of course, one could say the CD is realistic, but unfortunately probably not in the way intended by its producers."
4,We Want More!,This is a wonderful collection of songs and a fabulous CD. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the lack of Jane Horrocks. She was so amazing in the movie that she earned her place amoung the stars whose songs she sings. She deserves more recognition and more place on this album. This CD is worth buying for the wonderful music and the memory it brings back of such a fabulous movie. Let's hope there will be a second CD coming out later with more Jane Horrocks!
3,Great film shame about the CD!!,The film was brilliant and I really was expecting to hear J.Horrocks' singing the song!! (The credits at the end of the film made a note stating that she sang all the songs herself)-why didn't the CD represent this. I do feel a little cheated and conned by Miramax. Also Michael Caine's song wasn't even on the disc. Please get your act together and be more truthful about the music. Bring on Jane Horrocks!!
2,Contains Dye in it - So unnecessary,I cannot understand for the life of me why dye is added to color foods. I was excited to receive this to find out it has dyes and preservatives in it (which is not a good combo). I like to eat foods without these so I will be giving this away to the local food pantry.
3,Little Kick,I wish this had a lot more kick in it. Flavor is ok. Still trying to figure out what I should use it on.
5,A Classic Jewel,"My all-time favorite from the Nobel-prize winner Ivo Andric. Several stories wrapped up into one short masterpiece. Life, love, death, crime, punishment - all in a melting pot of cultures and religions. I try to have an extra one on hand to give to special people."
1,TALKS MORE ABOUT CAMERA'S EXPOSURE METER,This book explain more the disadvantage about the camera's exposure meter than teaching you to handle your hand held exposure meter. come on experts we know that basic true. the reason we bought this book is to get familiar with the Hand Exposure Meter but you did you teach us that?
3,Not so bad,"When I bought this book, I believed to waste my money, because I read the other customers review; but I wanted to buy it, because it was the only book about Sekonic meters.Now after I read the book, I agree with other customers that they said there are a lot of repeated concepts in the book, but in my opinion there are some suggestions in the book that I found helpful, about for example the possible use, and how to use an incident meter.So my final rate for this book is 3 stars.In conclusion it is not so bad, as I believed."
2,Sartlight Wintergreen candy,You advertise it's wintergreen and the candy are blue instead. I had to order it for my church and they like the windergreen. It's my first time to order from your company.
1,not work for WinXP service pack 2,"If you visit Micro Innovations website, you will be surprised that they never have this product. That is the reason when you upgrade your computer and try to find an upgraded driver for this mouse, nowhere to get it. Very frustrated."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,"I bought this new..and it has problems reading the memory stick and when i play some dvds, green spots come up on the tv, luckily it came with 3 month warranty, so i took it to get fixed and over 1 week passed...the lens had to get replaced..so now i have to wait for the shipment to arrive and then wait for the lens to work..the repair guy had to get my memory stick out cause i try this feature but my memory stick got stuck..there are so many problems ..thats why the price is so low ..come on its too good to be true..all those feature for such a cheap price"
4,"RD2200 22""",I thought the product lived up to it's billing. I just use the tv portion and find it to work very well. I'm very satisfied with the product.
3,NO SUPPORT,"As a TV this LCD is great. But as a monitor it leaves A LOT to be desired. I was hoping to use it for both TV and Monitor on my pc, but unfortunatly am only going to be able to use this as a TV.I was tried finding somewhere to download a driver, to see if that could help, but I am unable to find any way to contact the MFG no matter where I search. I tried going to NexGen Technologies Inc. home page http://www.nextechinc.com/(which is no longer available) or calling their suport number and it was disconected. So if your buying this, I would do so expecting no support.If anyone reading this does know of a site with drivers for this product please email me at itguyhere2004@yahoo.com"
2,Not What I expected,"I guess it's my own fault. I should have read the product details more closely. I was very shocked when I opened the little blue pouch and found that the necklace was smaller than a dime. I ordered two of these and I'm pretty sure I'm going to send them both back. The pendant is appropriately sized for a child, but the necklace is really too delicate to be a children's piece of jewelry. The product details clearly state the size of the necklace, and I know it's my own fault for not reading it, but I would have never thought an adult piece of jewelry would be so tiny. In addition to the tiny size, the pendant is stamped on one side. Several of the reviews say it twists when worn, and the stamp is very noticeable."
4,Good Item,"While the necklace is very pretty, it appears on Amazon to be bigger than it actually is. Before buying, read the dimensions that Amazon provides and see if that is large enough. Still though, I am satisfied."
2,poor design,"One side of the pendant is stamped with the silver mark. The way it hangs on the chain, the pendant flips over constantly, so you can see the stamp. We're sending it back!"
1,Don't be fooled!,"Don't be fooled by the great packaging and insert--rather than being Buddhist chanting, this is cheezy new-age music. Don't waste your time or money unless you want something fluffier than Enya."
3,Not too bad once you get used to it.....,"(...) I can quite see their point...the chants are traditional but set to modern music, however they are still slow enough to provide a quiet background repetitive tone, if you're busy doing something else. I have used the third track as an aide to meditation in my group of students and they're all quite taken with it; the chanting of the class in unison is a joy to listen to! Don't knock it 'til you've tried it; I listen to it whilst driving and find it enhances my concentration, even with the repetitive nature of the chants. Enjoy it for what it is; an amalgamation of traditional virtues mixed with the convenience of modernity. It's not too serious, and shouldn't be taken as such."
5,really a legend,Scott Summers is a legend for every x-man fan. Specially with this uniform (mid 70's). A classic from phoenix saga and my childhood. Good times... Are back!
3,Nice and Classic,"This toy is overall pretty darn good. He's well articulated, the sculpt is fantastic, and none of his parts were stuck or loose when I took him out of the package. Any time you have as many points of articulation as you have on a Marvel Legends toy, there's a potential for crummy joint disaster. My only suggestion to improve this toy would be to add a joint in the midsection so his torso could tilt forward or backward and I would have also gone with a neck joint that provided for a greater range of movement. Cyclop's power comes from his eyes, he should be able to point his head in a multitude of directions. I could have also done without the black paint wash as well. The untreated blue and yellow colors would have been just fine. Overall, this was a good toy, not the star of the line by any means, but well worth what I paid. :)"
5,marvel legends line,"another great character to come out of the marvel legends line.great detail and highly poseable. shipping was timely, i highly recommend buying this toy as i did, after it's release instead of wasteing your time on amazon's ""pre-sales"""
2,Boring,"Just from listening to the samples, the music is upbeat , fun drumming BUT, all the tracks sound the same!"
5,Press Quotes,"""...a star. Miss Wissinger has the sound and the rhythmic vitality of the very best. "" - Lavrov, Director Capella Leningrad, USSR"
1,waste of time and money,"We bought it and installed it, but after putting 1 month of poop in it 8 months later it is still there! I just got off the phone with customer service and they informed me that the thing should NEVER DRY UP. I am like, why don't you write that on your website? I live in the high desert so I should have the water on the thing 24-7? Bad product, and bad service. If you live in a very humid place it may work for you, but in my case they deserve a bad review because they sell the thing without giving proper information."
3,"Great concept, marginal quality","This is a great concept for disposal of dog waste. The product however, could definitely be a little more sturdy. On the first attempt to bury the container I was filling in the dirt around the sides - I tried to gently tap down the dirt with my foot, only to smash in one side of the container. I dug it back out, fixed the side, and tried again. The second time I did not bother to try to pack dirt around it, just lightly drop the dirt in. The weight of the dirt, however, was enough to skew the frame of the container such that the top is no longer squared, and thus the plastic lid does not close tightly or stay down. This has been solved by placing a brick on top. If the container was a bit heartier neither of these problems would have occurred.With that said, this is still the best solution I've seen to dog waste disposal."
4,Doggie Dooley 3800,"Product is so far so good. I think I would have opt. for the other bucket style model, just because this one has no water - and it allway seems like it is empty. I fill it once in the AM and one in the PM and both times they are bone dry. Make sure you are close to a water supply! But purchased this one because I have 2 large dogs. I have had it in place now for about 1 month, and working just fine."
1,One of the Worst Designed Products I've Ever Purchased,"All you get with this product is a $5 plastic box to sit over a hole in the ground and a bag of digester. But it gets worse--the user is supposed to dig a hole in the ground, put the droppings and digester powder in it, and fill it up with water on a daily basis. But--duh!!--any hole in the ground which is filled with water on a daily basis is going to eventually fill up with dirt washed from the sides. Mine lasted about two months before the hole had filled in. What a stupid idea!"
1,I can't believe I paid for this P.O.S.,Steer clear of this over-priced piece of flimsy plastic poo. I managed to shatter it just back-filling the hole while installing it. I am sorely dissapointed.
3,Don't bother,"I have two large dogs. And I clean up the poop almost daily. I thought this would be quicker for me and more practical. But this is more of a hassle than anything else. Spent alot of money to get started. And then spent more on the digester product and all the water I used as well. I couldn't believe how often I needed to add water and digester to keep this working properly. (I ended up buying the septic tank enzymes stuff you can buy at local store for a lot cheaper.) I used this for one season. After the temps dropped I went back to my old way of cleaning up the yard. I haven't started it back up. I decided that in the long run it was easier and cheaper to put the poop in a plastic bag and throw in the trash. Good concept, but just didn't work for us."
5,Love it!,"I bought this a few weeks ago and it works great. I have sandy soil and still trying to figure out how much water and how much ""enzymes"" I need to put in to get it to turn to sludge. The company really can't get precise directions because it depends on the weather and your soil type. The more water, the better! Currently testing existing drain cleaner in my house to see if that works as well as their enzymes."
3,Doggie Poo Bank,"OK you dig a hole, make it a little deeper in the center for extra capacity. It fills quickly if you use the manufacturers instructions of how deep to dig so I would go deeper if you have more then 1 dog. I'm using mine with 2 medium size and 2 small dogs, feeding them twice a day (Iams blue bag) equates too approx 8 loads a day. If you add the digester powder it does compact but either way (with or without powder) it will slowly settle.The overall design is a little flimsy, when placing into the hole DO NOT compact the soil around it. Just back fill loosely otherwise the the structural integrity is compromised. The top won't sit properly and the sides will bow in giving you less poo capacity. I know my garbage guys love it!"
2,Dooley is Doodie,"I bought this because I have three dogs and try to keep a nice yard. My first problem is that the hole you must dig is so deep, and my yard is all clay. This is not the products fault, but if you have roots, tough dirt, etc, be ready to put in a few hours work to install. The box is easy to collaspe, so be very careful, and follow directions when back filling. The spring lid broke early on and the soil I put this in did not perk out the waste. Again not the products fault, but so much of the Midwest soil is clay, I can't imagine it works all that well. I used bacteria to promote the decomposition as well as repeatedly filled it with water to assist in the breakdown of the waste, but it did not work very well. Eventually it filled up, and I pulled it out and filled in the hole. Now I use shopping bags, put them in a larger trash bag in a Home Depot bucket with the lid and place at the curb every trash day. Would not recommend this product, does not work as well as I wished it would."
1,Don't bother,It didn't work for us. Was a pain to install and refill and it broke almost straight away. I was reading some of the other reviews and I've got to say we ran into problems figuring out how to uninstall it as well. Just get a shovel it's cheaper and faster.
4,Useful for exam/test,I bought this for a library technical assistant exam and it had all the essentials needed. Their were other items with similar titles and from different years but this was the most updated and useful.
4,A rich musical score,Sandy Wilson's loveliest musical score is best served by this original London Cast recording.The only cavil being the lack of orchestra and frequent use of a period electronic keyboard and this rich score demands more than what it's been given.Melodically and lyrically this is a gem. Much more sophisticated than Wilson's The Boyfriend. Gorgeous. Someday hopefully we may get a new version that orchestrally does justice to Wilson's masterpiece.Damien Slattery
4,Basics never felt so good,"I love these boots, they are comfortable and durable. I have only worn out one pair of Doc's and that was from wearing them at work everyday for 3 years. Well I say worn out really they have just gotten to where the sole doesn't quite feel as comfortable. I am sure that with the chemicals and oil I walk through daily that is the biggest factor in the soles. Otherwise I just love these things, they cinch up tight when you pull the laces and fit in a very comfortable manner that never bites into your foot. If you have never worn a pair of Doc's you owe it to yourself to try them out."
2,Not a crafter's book.,"I bought this book with the intent to make rosaries, as such, the book is a bomb. There are a couple of pages about rosary-making.I suppose it works as a devotional manual and good history lesson, but it really has no business in the crafting category.However, even as a book about rosaries, there was a stunning lack of pictures of rosaries. Those on the front and back covers are all that exist. The rest of the photos are of pious statues. Why? I couldn't tell you."
2,Worked great until it CRACKED,"Bought this as soon as we moved into the apartment. Installation is pretty simple, although I had some trouble getting the threading on the faucet to sit well with the threading on the adapter. Once on, the filtering was top-notch. The water tasted great and there was no odor present. Then, after 3 1/2 months, I turn the water on to find it spraying out the back of the main compartment. Multiple cracks had formed and eventually gave way. I used some putty to seal the cracks, and the thing began cracking in more locations.I definitely don't recommend this product; unless, of course, you only plan to use it for 8 weeks."
1,Waste of Money,I bought this water filter as a replacement to the one I had that developed a crack. The crack is just near the use indicator. This one has developed the same crack. It is just over 2 months old. I wasn't even able to use one full cartridge. Beware! I've read of other people having the same issue.
2,Good until it breaks,"The filter worked fine at first. However, after about 2 months, the casing started to crack. The device still filters water, but water squirts out of the cracks all over the place. I tried to fix it with glue and tape (which might actually be a very bad idea since some of the residue could wind up in my water), but it still leaks. My 2 brothers have the same filter and the same thing happened to them. If you go to the [...] website you will see that many more people have had the same problem. I recommend that you look for a filter with a more sturdy casing."
1,worst filter ever- do not buy,"I have used this filter for 2 months now and had to replace about 3 filters in such a short span. The filter works good but you have to spend more than any other filters. The manufacturers are clever to lure the customers by the easy mechanism initially but the speed slows down and so does your patience to wait atleast an hour for your water to get purified. If you want to buy a filter that works good to 2 weeks this will be your choice but if want something to last longer "" do not buy it""."
2,Awesome ... For the First 6 Months,"I got this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas last year. I live alone in my apartment so this simple Pur filter was perfect ... or so I thought.At the beginning of June, not even 6 months after I got it, the side of the plastic had cracked and a small stream of water was spraying from it. I stopped using the filter, but now even the point where the filter attaches to the faucet's nozzle it has began leaking.I hate leaving bad reviews, but 6 months of having this product and it's leaking in two places is ridiculous ... especially considering that I live alone and it gets minimal traffic.Next time I will invest the money in a high quality filter of a different brand."
1,Cracks Quickly,"Length:: 0:07 MinsAfter just a couple of months, the filter developed a crack so bad that couldn't even be solved by duct tape. Useless filter."
1,Housing Cracked,After several months of use (< 6) the housing developed multiple hairline cracks that allow water to spew all over the place. WHAT A MESS! This thing is not worth the money. I've tried covering the cracks with epoxy putty but no use. The water just finds another way out. STAY AWAY FROM THIS THING!
3,"Filters good, but the faucet housings crack!","These filters do a great job of clearing up sediment in the water, and eliminating chemical taste. However, I've had two of the housings crack in the last year. The first was within an in-store 30 day warranty, so I simply did a switch at Lowes. The second cracked as well after four months, Lowes would not replace it. This week I'll see if the manufacturer will provide a solution. TR"
1,Because Negative Stars Are Not Available,This product has really gone down hill fast. PUR used to be a fantastic company with a great product but I cannot recommend this product. The cover fell off within two days and water started seeping from the filter life display. Within two weeks hairline cracks turned into gaps where unfiltered water gushes out negating the fact that a small stream of filtered(?) water is coming out also. In short more unfiltered water leaks out than comes out of the thing. What are these people doing that are running this company? What is wrong with them and don't they know that their viability as a company and their reputation is completely worthless now? It's hard to believe that anyone would create cheap plastic junk like this. Frankly I don't trust the filter anymore either since I am sure if the main unit is so cheaply and poorly crafted that similiar quality is now going into their filters. PUR do something soon!
2,Failed After 7 Months,"I have to concur with other reviewers; I have been a user of PUR filter systems (faucet mount) for many, many years - the product has degraded in more recent years. I am tired of being sprayed with water when the unit falls off - it has now happened 4 times in the last 30 minutes and I am NOT a happy customer! Led me to write this review and look for another product."
5,love it,This works great..what a convenience to have it..and its easy to remove if needed..which I haven't had to yet..I highly recommend this if you want clean drinking/cooking water
2,Great price but poor quality,I decided to purchase this because it was cheaper than buying filter alone. Product does not last long but for the price you can not complain. Every three month I buy a new one because it starts to leak bad.
2,"Good Water, LONG Wait","This filter worked great for about the first week of use. Our water tested better in a blind taste-test and seemed cleaner.Unfortunately, after one week, the filtration process got slower and slower and SLOWER. At first, a glass of water took 5 seconds, then 10, and then like 20-30 seconds. It got so bad we started putting a 1 gallon jug under the filter and waited 1-3 hours for a gallon of filtered water! Not only that, but the filter replacement indicator says the filter is just fine and doesn't need to be replaced (as it shouldn't, being only 1 month old).Also, the filter does take up a bit of space on your faucet, so you may want to consider an alternative if you have a small sink."
2,Cracked and Leaking,"I've had and enjoyed this product in past homes, but this time the one I bought developed cracks in the housing below the indicator window. Water is now spewing forth from the cracks so bad that I've had to stop using it. I'm in the process of trying to contact the company . . . maybe they'll replace it for me. What a hassle."
1,Me too...,"Ever wish you had read the reviews first? Like just about everyone here, I bought this ""PUR 2-Stage Vertical White Faucet Mount"" and had it work just fine for about a month before it developed cracks and started spraying water all over me.The problem is with the design. The filter is just too heavy, and it slowly puts pressure on the side connecting to the faucet. Eventually little hairline cracks will emerge, and the water will start to seek out those cracks, widening them and spraying you with a faceful of water every time you try and use it.These side-mounted vertical faucet filters seem like a great deal, but the design is fundamentally flawed."
3,Water tastes fine but then it cracks,"I had it for a year now... and its literally a giant mess now.Like everybody else says, it's cracking everywhere and unfiltered water is mixing with filtered water (making the water taste like tap water...) before this though it did a good job, water tasted great..."
1,Poor quality,Our Pur starting getting cracks in it before it was even time to replace this first filter. Now it sprays water out the side every time we try to use it. Waste of money.
2,Cheap,I have yet to replace a filter in one of these. The outer shell over the filter cracked on the last two units I bought; probably due to the water pressure as it is forced through the filter.
1,hairline cracks,"I've bought a pur filter years ago, and never had a problem. I've bought three in the past year. One broke at the valve where it mounts on the faucet, and the other two developed hairline cracks on the body of the unit within a month or two. I guess the quality has gone down quite a bit. I highly recommend you buy another brand."
1,Many leaks after only 3 months,"The indicator window will leak!!!!! ...and leak everywhere. I have had two of these things and they both leaked badly. My current one is being held together with a pip clamp which extended its life about 2 months. How hard could it be to develop a system that doesn't leak under normal household water pressure? I do like what it does to the water but come on, make the thing last more than a couple of months. Arghhh."
2,Sprung two leaks,"I had owned one before for years and it worked great. After it got misplaced after a move, I purchased this one. Worked fine for about a month and then it sprung a leak in two places.UPDATEWhen I contacted P&G; on their website, they sent me a coupon for a free PUR filter. Great customer service! However, the new filter I purchased had something wrong with the gasket that tightens against the faucet and I couldn't get it to stop leaking (this wasn't a problem with the first one). I meant to return it but forgot and now it's been a few months so it's too late. Oh well.I would lower my rating to a 1 star from 2 since both of them were bad."
2,Housing Cracks Quickly,"We are only on our second filter in the until and already the housing has several cracks. One next to the replacement indicator window (leaking), another where the unit mounts to the faucet. This unit is so easy compared to some Brits units (really, it is), but having to replace the unit once a year is ridiculous. We'll be getting another Brita."
5,No more pitcher to fill,"What a joy to turn on the tap,turn the unit into the up position and out comes filtered, clean,and good tasting water. No more filling the pitcher for ice cubes, tea or just drinking ( which I do all day)The company is wonderful to work with. I thought my unit was defective, I called and was enlighten. They sent couponds for filters and a new unit if I wanted.. P & G gets my vote. great product."
1,Hate the one click design!,"The new design is cheap and garbage. The plastic adapter that screws on to the faucet has to support the weight of the unit, it doesn't. Within the first week the threads on the adapter have failed because they are cheap plastic and the filter no longer will stay on. Last time it fell off it squirted water all over the kitchen counters up the walls and window treatments. Done. They should have spent another 50 cents on metal adapters and had a relatively decent product. Pinch pennies, lose customers. I've had Pure on my faucets for at least the last 15 years. No more."
1,Vertical Model is the Worst,"I bought two of these vertical models (one for me and one for my parents) and they are the worst because they only last a couple of months. After that, the filtered water hardly comes out of the filter even after you put in a new cartridge. The first couple of months, a small stream of water comes out of the filter and then the stream becomes small drips and never quite function the same. At first I thought it was just my mount, but the other mount did the same exact thing, so it's the model and not the individual mount. However, I later bought the PUR horizontal models, and they work well for at least a couple of years before those crack. So, don't bother with the vertical models, get yourself the horizontal models."
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUYThe ""quick"" disconnect will quickly cement itself to the unit, and removing it from the faucet will instead strip the threads on the cheesy plastic adapter. Removing said adapter is impossible, making the unit useless."
1,Pur-ely Disappointed,"I'm on my third or fourth Pur filter in three years. The first one lasted the longest, but the most recent filters haven't lasted long enough to make it to the first filter replacement. Both of the past two that I had cracked around the faucet connection and in the main filter housing. For the price, the quality is unsatisfactory. I'm looking for a different type of filter for my next purchase."
4,Decent Water Filter for the Money,"This is my third PUR faucet mount in about 12 years. The first one worked for several years, but wouldn't fit my new faucet when I moved; on the second, I just ran out of filters, so I took it off.I really like the new clip-on design. I don't use it everyday as I fill 4 or 5 gallon water bottles at a time.The issue I have is that each filter is supposed to filter up to 100 gallons of water. I purchased this product 3 months ago and the light is blinking red. There is no way I've filtered 100 gallons of water. Maybe half that.So as one reviewer suggested, I took out the filter and reinserted it and the light turned green. I believe this is a design flaw. My previous experience with PUR filters is that when the filter is done no water comes out and it is very heavy.Overall, for the money, I think it was a good purchase.PS you can use the 2 or 3 stage filters in this product."
1,Waste of money,I've used PUR faucet water filtration systems for more than 10 years. The first unit lasted several years and was great! I've raved over how great it is to be able to just have the unit right on your faucet. Over the years the units have deteriorated in quality to the point where the last three units didn't through 2 filters (I've tried different models). I've had this model for less than a month and it is squirting water all over my kitchen - it hasn't even made it through one filter. I won't buy a PUR product again.The filters are still great.I'm going to try the Culligan faucet mounted unit - I'm seeing great reviews for it.
1,Do not buy,"Originally, I had posted a favorable review. However, after two months of use this faucet system cracked and became unusable, unless I wanted water sprayed all over my kitchen each time I used it, due to two cracks in the casing. At that point, the water was also cloudy after coming through the filter, so I am not sure what the filter was actually doing. After reading another review, I realized that the filter system that I was shipped was not actually the system pictured in this listing. This week I purchased the filtration system that is shown in this ad, and I am hopeful I'll have a better experience with it. Seems much sturdier and more well built."
1,Learned a lesson...,"I purchased the white two stage system and like so many on here, the plastic housing cracked and started spraying water all over the place after about 3 months.I also bought two replacement filters, which now will go to waste as I won't be buying another PUR product. Lesson is don't buy extra filters until needed, in case the product is junk. Like this one is. What a waste of good money."
2,Horrible,"but the company stood behind its product and replaced it with whatever one I wanted so I tried again and it happened again. It would leak through the indicator window. So, I again called and they again sent a coupon for whatever one I wanted. So, this time I got the 3 stage one that you don't move and it has a electronic indicator. So far not to bad except w/a little leaking from the actual faucet side but I just think I need to tighten the black ring."
2,Give me a break!,"This makes good-tasting water, but you'll only have that pleasure for two weeks. These filters get clogged faster than you can get a chance to enjoy the rewards!"
2,"Great Filter, Horrible Housing","I've used Pur filters for years and always loved them. When my old Pur filter housing finally died after several years of heavy use, I bought this one.They've changed. The new one cracked within a couple of months and started spraying water all over the kitchen.I still love what their filters do to the water, but I'm not willing to support a company that makes such terrible housing for those filters. Change back NOW, before you lose your last customer!"
1,Can't handle the pressure.,"The housing is terrible. Cracked by month 1. Gushing by month 2. The only good thing is that it still works as long as I barely turn on the water pressure. Our water pressure isn't even that high at full blast, but it was enough to crack it. If you buy this, do not turn up the pressure all the way when using it. Actually, just don't buy this junk."
1,Outrage,"In line with many posted comments, the mounting assembly is an inferior product that it is being pushed on the public by a ""reputable"" brand. This is unconscionable. PUR should be ashamed of themselves.....and I think they know the hoax they are perpetrating, as their customer service is impossible to get service from. I am a lost customer and I am sure that I am not alone. Their strategy of selling the hardware at a low cost to hook you into continuing to buy a string of expensive filters needs to be re-thought before they go out of business. The hardware should have some modicum of quality. These do not."
1,If you use an adapter....,"I purchased both the horizontal and the vertical, after the horizontal fell off..still have both of them. What a crock, I hope they take them back. Bought locally, fortunately. After the filter gets heavy with water it just falls off in the sink when you go to turn it on. When you use the adapter it's suppose to just click into place and it does click but it will..., grrrrr, fall off, my experience anyway."
1,Bad Product Design,I have the same problems others have had with the filter housing cracking and leaking. It cracked around the window for the indicator that let's you know when to change the filter before I even had a chance to change the first filter (1 month). The water from this leak rides down the side of the housing and into the filtered water stream. If you have ever seen the dirty side of a filter imagine water from that leaking into what you are about to drink; not very sanitary. Also the faucet attachment started to leak which would spray a tiny stream onto the counter.It's products like this that doesn't help the economy. Who wants to give their hard earned money away. With every bad product like this I grow more reluctant to spend.
5,Water filter purchase,"Second filter of this type that I've used. Be sure you know how to remove the filter before your break the unit (e.g., run water with the cap off). Anyway, a good filter at a cheap price!"
1,"Junk - two big leaks, one on front, one on back","Mine also broke after about 3 months. I am trying to see if the manufacturer will do anything, but have not been able to reach anyone."
1,It's crap!,"Look, I admit, I'm terrible when it comes to changing filters on my water pitcher. But honestly, this is just too much. Everyone else has commented on the filter cracking, but we never got to that point - because the stupid thing slowed to the point where it was USELESS before we'd had it more than 3 weeks. Everything I read said we needed a new filter, even though the indicator light still blinked green. I refused to buy a new filter - because the only reason I bought this was to save money on buying bottled water. Instead, we left bottles under the dripping filter to fill overnight. I was glad when we moved and I could toss this. An absolute waste of money."
1,It's tiny!!!,It took forever to recieve this item and when i did it was absolutely tiny!!! Not much bigger than the size of a piece of printer paper.
4,Washington State,"Cool Book. I've read a couple other books out of the same type of ""series"", but now I can't find anymore!! Darn!!"

4,Music perfectly fitting for its odd but fascinating film,"I actually haven't listened to the cd, but I've got the tape, which I dubbed onto cd rather well. This music is not too far from say, the credits music they use for Xena, just for the sake of comparison. It seems like they've included just about every musical sound from the actual film, which is appropriate, since I've seen few films that used music more effectively. This music so specifically fits the film, which I think is an odd, wonderful story. I recommend both (the video can often be found in rental stores)."
3,It's fine but not great,"The charger works just fine, but if the charger was meant for travelling the fairly long and thick cable may not be such a good thing; and perhaps they could have made the plug part smaller or flipable to use less space."
5,One of my all-time favorites,"Saw this on Broadway (as the second half of ""Falsettos"") and loved it; have listened to the cast album so often, I'd have worn it out if it had been vinyl. Powerful, emotional, loving, surprising, funny, tragic--all appropriate descriptions for this album. {ProfJonathan}"
4,Where's Willy,"ISBN 1564021610 - Toddler siblings Willy and Lily, who failed to impress me inGood Night, Lily, get a little better in Where's Willy? Sturdy board book pages will stand up to your young reader and a mere 29 words make this book a good beginning reader.Lily and Willy play hide and seek. Willy hides in a bag and, when it tears open, pops out peek-a-boo style.Martha Alexander's illustrations are a little pastel-y for me, making them pleasant rather than good. For some reason, the top layer of the pages peels almost too easily; once they start peeling, there's no stopping it. The story is fun, and funny - little kids will enjoy it, especially because they'll know where Willy is before Lily.- AnnaLovesBooks"
2,It's just OK,"I was excited when I saw the price because I'd been looking for a cheap cordless that had an answering machine. I love the answering machine and the features that come with it. My problem is with the headset; it is very hard to hear the person on the other end. I have to have the volume all the way up, but then I have to talk softly because I'll hear myself YELLING and can BARELY hear the person on the other end. I have to be in a quiet room with no kids, TV or dogs to hear and use this phone, and most of the time, that just isn't possible."
1,bought two with same problem,I use a headset with this phone for meeting and both phones that I bought ended up static and the person on the line couldnt hear me cause the hole that the headset fits into is defective. 2 phones in two years and same problem in both of them. I recommend spending a little more for a better quality phone.
1,Just Cheap,I couldn't hear well at all from this phone and the volume does not go up very high. I have returned two of them. Maybe good just for a second phone or something but I wasn't impressed. Just spring for a little better one in the 2.4GHz range and save the time and effort!
2,Worst battery I have ever seen,Battery discharges only in 30 minutes of talking. I personally never recommend this item. Answering machine is good but battery is worst.
1,Horrible choice,"I had a VTech phone that lasted me 3 years before I spilled water on it and had to get a new phone. So I went out and got this Uniden phone without really researching any phones beforehand. It lasted a couple months before one day, it stopped working. I couldn't recieve or make calls, or get messages on my answering machine. I tried everything the website and owners manual said and called their customer support line and the lady told me to send it to Texas to be repaired (I'm in Virginia). So I decided to just forget about it and buy a new phone. Needless to say, I'm not buying Uniden anymore."
1,Lots of static,"The phone has too much static unless you're sitting right next to the console, in which case you might has well have a corded phone."
3,Functional but barely,"I bought this because I wanted a cheap no-frills phone with answering system, but it's performed very poorly compared with the one I had previously. Specifically, it's very hard to hear anything on this phone, even with the volume set to maximum. Definitely not worth buying.2012 update: I am changing this from a one-star to a three-star review. After moving to a new apartment, I found that the volume was suddenly no longer a problem. The technical reason for this location-specific performance is unclear, but the phone isn't as bad as I originally thought."
2,can't get rid of the static noice,"now that I have this phone for a while, I would say that the only good things about this phone is the size and the price. I read reviews on amazon before I purchased this phone. I still wonder how Uniden phones got so many positive reviews. This one definitely sucks."
2,good while it lasted,"I purchased this particular low priced nailer because of good reviews it received on other web sites. The nailer worked really well for maybe 200 nails then started mis firing more frequently to the point where it wouldnt fire a nail anymore. I tinkered with it a bit, not a good idea. I'm going to call it a loss. The 3 times I used it paid for itself in HD rental fees.Just wish it wasnt such a disposable tool."
2,disappointed,"Warning-using this blade to cut 3/8"" SLATE tile will leave rough edges. I guess I should have spent more time in the forums LOL."
1,Very Dissatisfied,"The product contained MANY ant fragments, still identifiable with pieces such as thorax and legs, or head with mandibles still visible. The insects were cooked INTO the paper sheets, and hadn't merely gotten into the package during shipping. I understand that almost all food products have some trace pieces of insect, but if your product has that many, you need to redefine how you transport and manufacture your food products."
1,Horrible product from Amazon,I have bought this product in the store many times and it is great. However buying from Amazon was a huge mistake. The product came open and broken all over. Complete waste of money and time. Never buy this from Amazon.
3,Cooking mama,Sadly these rice papers were very fragile. They ripped in every roll. I have one package that I haven't used and probably not going to use.
2,refer to it carefully,"I've been going through a few books recently on ""world music"" and because of its compact information, this book seemed to be ""buyable"". However, going through a few informations, I am not only confused about the language (""Germany has produced precious little world music...""), but also about the accuracy as one of the readers here mentioned before: i.e.: ""When it comes to world music, however, Japan is not a major player. With the exception of Okinawa."" If so, what is with bunraku, kabuki, even ainu etc.? (You can argue here, what the author considers 'world music' (see foreword)) Furthermore, the recommendations for recordings seem to be not up to date.Sorry, for being a bit picky, but the two stars is for a general good and helpful concept, but this book lacks - as I said - here and there precise informations and a non-centristic attitude in writing."
2,How Could They?,"Beautiful Waves, and the French gal could likely have her way with me. Other than that, you cannot believe how bad this film is. If you can view Liquid Bridge as a comedy, it's actually pretty good. Hey, I watched the whole thing! It's got more plot twists and turns than a grinder at Rincon. Pretty radical stuff. The lead character and his development is so unbelievable, again, gotta go for the comedy eyes. Some really beautiful surf photography though, I must admit. There will be times, however, when you will say, ""I can't believe I'm sitting here and watching this thing......how could they?"" Aloha."
3,I liked it,"I bought this movie because Ryan Kwanten is in it. I love his work on True Blood and am anxious to see him in everything else he does - he is a great actor! I hadn't heard of this movie before, but the price was great and has Ryan Kwanten starring so I bought it. I didn't read the summary of the movie, so I was quite surprised with all of the turns this movie makes. I thought Ryan was great, and it certainly is not your typical surf movie. Very interesting!"
2,"its ok, nothing special","this game is ok. its fun for like the first 2 or 3 days that you have it. once you learn the moves and bust some flip-spin tricks off the lip a few times the novelty wears off. the contest are tough and long and get kind of boring. i donno about how close to real surfing it comes, but the game play could use work and the view its kind of strange. all and all its cool but not worth buying."
2,surf's up...NOT,"The ONLY reason that I gave this game two (2) stars is because it's the only one i've seen...after all, surfing is a tough sport to transcribe from the ocean to the video game console.Plain and simple: This game stinks. The game isn't worth borrowing, renting or even loading onto one's playstation.Just a few of the game's shortcomings include:1. Poor graphics 2. Rider difficult to control 3. Unrealistic scenarios 4. Rider can only go one direction (frontside, regular foot)So many other sports have been well-represented as games on the Playstation that are similar to surfing (such as snowboarding and skateboarding). I hope that the next time someone attempts to put out a surfing game, he puts forth a much greater effort.It doesn't give me pleasure to be so critical but I'd rather give someone the 411 than to have him piss away his hard earned money."
5,"Great for anyone interested in herpetology, field studies, or an fascinating life story of an interesting man","I am a college student studying organismic biology. I am taking an ecology class this semester and our text is by Eric Pianka. Herpetology is one of my passions so when I found out Pianka was a ""lizard man"" I did some research and came upon this book. It turned out to be everything I hoped it would be. The book is written in a manner that engages the reader; you will be held captive as he writes about his childhood experiences and methods of lizarding."
4,Beautifull Opera Gala,"Obviously you have to be an Opera fan to appreciate these segments. Ramon Vargas is absolutely top notch and the rest of them fill in very well. My only objection is that the camera moves a bit too much instead of stying more focused on the artists. The sound is excellent, would recommend it to anyone who loves Operas. Daniel from Mexico City."
4,The quest for perfection,"Marco Armiliato makes an example of how an orchestra needs to sound to support the singers and to be a solist itself. Magnificent.Tezier and Garanca are in increasing form of singing, nevertheless are perhaps little moveless. The XXI century singers needs to be more agile at stage, in opera and concert.Netrebko and Vargas are in frenetical race with their respective colleagues to be considered the prima donna and the primo tenore.Netrebko is radiant, with a singing plein of virtuosism, of color, of power.Vargas is technically great. The voice proyection, his phrasing, and his control makes a loving lirical model.It is a concert to enjoy."
5,Incredibly Entertaining.,"Usually I prefer a full opera, rather than medly of famous arias. The problem with a bunch of sweet arias is there is no emotional build up and rapport between audience and the performers. This is one exception.At the beginning, I had doubts how it will pan out. To the credit of producers and the singers, there actually was a gradually build up all the way to the end. It is highly entertaining and you get swept away by all four singers, although Netrebco often stole the show. It is a very very enjoyable performance."
4,Fllexion Point,"As a result of HD transmission and DVD's opera has reached a flexion point. It is no longer enough for an opera star to just stand and sing. She must be able to emote creditably and in many parts to be a trained dancer. Anna Netrebko illustrates this flexion point. She and the technology reinforce each other. I will watch and listen to this DVD many, many times."
4,Some of Dietrich's best work--very haunting at times.,"I've listened to much of Dietrich's work, and this album is my favorite. She shows more vulnerability than before or since, and her singing had matured noticeably since her days of major film stardom."
4,no mercy plus a secret,Great pay per view with booker T vs. John Cena stealing the show. John cena once again u.s. champion. That Damn JBL cheated to win again.

2,The worst Smackdown PPV ever!!!!!!!!,"I am writing this review as a warning, that in terms of the WWE, newer isn't better and the recent No Mercy proves my point. This PPV demoted former WWE Champion Eddie Guerrero to the opening match. We saw John Cena and Booker T class for the 5th time, therefore the whole novelty of this encounter had worn off.We saw two awful tag team encounters providing Mysterio & RVD against Dupree & Suzuki, and the Dudley Boys and Dawn Marie taking on Rico, Charlie Haas and Miss Jackie. How on earth could the Dudley Boys lose to these guys?Therefore, the only highlights of this pay per view in my opinion were Big Show vs Kurt Angle and Billy Kidman vs Paul London. As for the main event, it has been seen already so change the channel."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SD PPVS EVER ! ! !,jbl v.s undertaker 10/10big show v.s kurt angle 10/10eddie gurrero v.s luther reigns 10/10john cena v.s booker t 10 / 10paul london v.s billy kidmen 10/10the rest i vote between a 7 - 9
3,meh,"there is really only two matches on this event worth watching.1. Billy kidman vs Paul london. I loved this match because it had high flying and brawling. The two shooting star presses that kidman did were incredible, and the one that london did may of been the best i have ever seen. 3/5and of course the main event Undertaker vs JBL. It was a brawl, nothing more and nothing less. It was a little to slow paced to really get into, and the interference at the end really ruined it, yet it is worth watching. 2.5/5Do not get this event because it will be a big dissapointment."

3,Not again,"Ok, ok this is getting a little out of hand and a little too graphic. First of all people keep getting in the business of the Undertaker vs. JBL matches for the WWE championship. Heidenrich is a psychotic freak driven and mentored by Paul Heyman and they made Undertaker lose the match and then rammed into the hearse where he was laying. The WWE's pay-per-view content used to be extroadinary, now it is predictable and crazy. The other matches were exceptionally well except for the final one which was way out of hand."

3,"overpriced here, but yummy","Okay, like the other reviewer said, if you buy this from Amazon, you'll pay way too much. I bought it at my local grocery store, and I live in a rural area. So most people will be able to find this without paying the Amazon price, in addition to shipping.But how does it taste? I loved it. I've never had other brands to compare it too, but this one has a refreshing ginger taste and bite. It is mildly sweet and very mildly salty; those are not the dominant flavors at all though, ginger is.BUT, the jar I bought, that looks identical to the picture here, does not contain sugar, it has aspartame (NutraSweet) for sweetness. I'm not wild about that, even though I do like the absence of sugar. I'll be looking for a sugar free, artificial sweetener-free sushi ginger."
3,kinda disappointed,"I puchased quite a bit of this product and no matter the mixture, I was rather disappointed with this. I've changed to jamilla instead, with great results! I'm very pleased with the new choice. This isnt a good one for beginings because its not a good representation of what henna is and can do. I suggest doing a bit more research and finding a reliable distributor who is more familiar with the limitations and needs of henna."
2,total is 60g!!!,"I ordered 3 bag 60g which I thought each bag is 60g. Now I received 20g per bag, total is 60g. With this price, I have no comments."
4,Great Deal!,I saw these and wanted to gry it out Very good product with well detailed descriptions on how to use it.
1,Dont Bother,"Order was shipped promptly, but that is where positive feedback ends. I have mixed 2 different batches, 2 different recipes but no dye release on either batch."
1,Think twice before buying,"I returned this henna powder for a refund. The only directions provided were in another language, therefore, we had no idea how to mix. A woman finally came by who could read an interpreted the directions for us. The quality was poor, also, in comparison to other powders we had purchased from Amazon in the past (only wish I knew which one)!"
4,Well worth checking out,"I love Deepak Chopras voice for stuff like this whereas when I listen to audio books by him he tends to send me to sleep.There are a billion meditation music cd's out there and better ones too. However, this is worth buying just for the guided chakra meditation. He walks you through the meditation explaining the name and purpose of each of the 7 major chakras without it ever feeling intruisive. There is plenty of time between his talking to allow yourself to concentrate on the chakra involved and go inside.Of course you can do it on your own when you get used to what you are supposed to be doing but I still stick my Ipod on from time to time."
3,Good mediation,This is a nice simple meditation which I used periodically. Not the best I have used and surely not the worst.
5,deepak,"really a good booklet an info combined with cd. ecellent mediatition or massage music. good shape, good price. would heighy recoomend it for myself or gift. thank you.."
4,Get Your Charkras Balanced!,During my meditations using Charkra Balancing I can literally feel the changes in my body as I go through the different areas of concentration. I have had it about a month now and I live my everyday life differently as well. I have more patients and understanding to all situations.
1,CD Download,You can NOT download the CD from the publisher. Book is out of print and they no longer offer any support. Make sure the copy you buy includes the CD.
5,Informative,"This book is an eyeopener. For the vegetarian as well as the nonvegetarian. It gives a good account of how different religious faiths around the world and across time have preached a meatless diet. It's pretty well known that buddhists and hindus preach vegetarianism, but I was particularly interested to learn there is a strong tradition of vegetarianism in the Jewish and Christian traditions."
3,"Not bad, but hardly ideology-proof","I had Dr Bogle as a teacher at the U. of Richmond. His class was taught from his two books found on this site. I first thought it was odd that the entire class was based on his own writings. There's a well-rounded perspective for you. This book bends over backwards in parts to explain away bad deeds by Muslims. The genocide perpetrated on Armenians by Turks in 1915 is DENIED. Amazing. If you can overlook that, and similar whitewashing of other events, it's a halfway decent overview on the region, if you're really interested in the subtleties of Arab dictatorships."
1,"nice, for a hot minute...!","This seemed great out of the gate but less than a week after purchase the lid no longer seals tightly; just sits loosely on top of the carafe, defeating the purpose (heat retention)- i would NOT purchase this but would spend more money on a make and model that might last more than a week"
1,Were they aiming for the worst game on the system?,"Okay, the graphics are nice, but everything else just (stinks)...majorly. IT IS THE MOST HIDEOUS TRANSLATION ON THE ENTIRE DREAMCAST, and seriously flawed plotlines and pacing problems abound.In fact, you can see exactly where the developers and programmers wanted to go. It could have been a very intriguing mystery/survival horror mix with just enough difference from the Resident Evil/Silent Hill genre to keep it interesting. They just needed to have a brain in their heads before the project began."
1,Boring,"This game is super boring and it reminds me of an old DOS PC game. Lame, and after trying it once I never played it again"
2,This game looks good from the packaging,"But when you start the game the storyline, while original, is played out like a joke. I am waiting to see a GOOD movieline on Dreamcast though. All the game movies are like dubbed over martial arts movies. The gameplay reminds me a lot like Resident Evil. It's TOO much like Resident Evil actually. I'd recommend D2 and of course Resident Evil: Veronica over this game. NFL2K1 is the best game for the Dreamcast though by far."
5,Great for Gate Opener,Bought this to put in our gate opener. Easy to wire up. 12v or 24v. 315MHz so able to program & use my garage door opener 3 button remotes. Metal housing with screw terminals for power wires. Coax antenna connection. Antenna included. Good quality product and has been trouble free since I installed it over a year & half ago.
5,MAGNIFICENT,"Rapping With The Gods displays the best elements of 21st Century soul, cosmic funk, deep jazz and afro beats united by a dancefloor spirit - a stunning combination of authenticity and infectious optimism.One of 2003's essential albums - enjoy the magic!"
4,Unbroken Page Thriller,"Lucas Davenport is on the trail of another killer. The recently released Charlie Pope has gone on a murder spree -- or has he?The family is overseas so the action is all about the mystery. I'll try to avoid spoilers, but there are a number of twists and turns. From reading the other reviews, you already know that the book is a bit ""rough"" -- there are a lot of killings and they are sexually oriented. Clearly if you are squeamish, this isn't the book for you -- but then you probably aren't in this genre if that bothers you."
3,"Alright, but that's about it","Two notes: This was my first Sandford novel, and I read it right on the heels of ""The Quiet Game"" by Greg Iles. Stopping myself from comparing the two was impossible. Though ""Broken Prey"" was entertaining in places, I found myself unable to really enjoy the book. There were certainly several things right - fast pace, plenty of action, some mystery, humor, etc, but somehow they all never came together."
4,Lucas Does it Again,"This one is a bit gruesome with a bad guy that will turn your stomach.But Sandford does it again with the continuing ""Prey"" series. I do not like to discuss characters or plot - leave that to the reader.I thoroughly enjoy Sandford novels and think this one deserves to be on your ""must read"" list."
2,Let him go,"In Broken Prey, Lucas' wife advises him to let Sloan go - to let him retire. To Mr. Sandford, I'd say: Let him go. Let Lucas go. He's tired.While I do appreciate the ""Gods Down the Hall"" name, there's little else I liked about the book. Something I especially disliked was Lucas' wife' name: Weather. What in the hell?! The stupidest name in fiction, maybe? Maybe there's some story about her name in a previous Prey, but jeez louise. Doesn't the author have an editor to kill some of these ill-conceived ideas?I've accidentally read this book twice. The first time, I got a kick out of the 100 best rock songs thing. This second time, it just came across as kind of cheesy. But then I voluntarily read this book a second time, so what do I know?There was a large swath toward the end that became so tedious, I just skipped ahead to the big finish."
3,Routine and readable,"I like John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series. I have been reading them for over a decade and find them very readable and a guaranteed time-filler.They will not make you remember them after you have read them as they are fairly formulistic. There is nothing in the books that will make you think. Nothing original.That being said, the books are very readable and the characters are quite ok, although maybe not that special.A guaranteed good read but not at the level of a George Pelecanos."
5,great read,Lucas D never lets you down when you want a good detective story.Sanford's detail and characters always paint the picture and keep you wanting to read the next book.
1,Worst of the Prey series,"What Sandford did to one of my all time fiction heros, Lucas Davenport, is shameful. Lucas was frantic, running around like a chicken with its head off. Lucas getting along with everyone, a nice guy, no conflict with anyone (except the final Craislike shoot-out at the end). Unusual for Sandford, much too much gratutious sex and violence described in graphic form. This book replaces 'Winter Prey' as the worst book in the 'Prey Series'."
3,Broken Prey,I thought the book was pretty good. I really enjoyed getting to see the older Lucas but I miss the younger version of him also.
2,way below awerage for the series,"The Prey series is generally weak on the investigative part, but this one is far worse in this respect: lots of pretty evident things are overlooked in order to construct the mother of all final shootouts. And some sex scenes are very nauseatting.On the plus side we will get a list of 100 greatest rock-n-roll songs in the end."
3,who's who?,"Am I the only reviewer who thought this book had too many characters to keep up with? I am addicted to Lucas and have read all the Prey books, but this is the first time I can recall having this problem. Maybe I'm just getting old!"
1,audio version is bad,"i listen to books in my car driving to and from work and this is the first time i have been unable to finish because the reader was bad. the publishers should listen to the person they have hired before they make the audio version. this guy has a really weird voice and worse.... he is unable to adjust the voices of the two main characters so that you cannot tell who is saying what. i think the story is a good one, just wish i was reading it instead of listening"
2,A little tired,"John Sandford continues to write well, and there is some gripping excitement in Broken Prey. But Lucas and the prey series seem to be getting a little tired and the plot here is so contrived as to be nonsensical."
2,No Mystery,"For anyone who has read the Prey series, you will know who the killer is long before he is ""revealed."" A bit formulaic."
5,Pray for More Preys,"Sandford delivers a taut book laced with plenty of humor, tension, violence, and pace. The dialogue is as good as Elmore Leonard's, the comic-relief is frequent and appropriate, and the pacing and crimes are done to perfection. I plowed through this entry in the Davenport series, and wish I could discover the entire series anew so I could relive the literary satisfaction again.Highly recommended!"
4,Best of Prey,I enjoyed this novel very much. It was suspenseful and exciting. it was everything that the last novel wasn't. just when you thought you knew who the killer a rug was pull under you. I highly recommended this book.
5,Broken Prey Great,This was another great story. Sure did not see the end coming. The last couple of chapters were simply outstanding!
3,More gore than I can take,"This is a book with the usual qualities of Sandford: it is neatly packed and logical and if you start it, you will finish it as soon as you can: the interest is sustained.It did not work for me. I don't have the stomach for too much gore, and an abundance of profanity does annoy me.I keep the book because it has Sandford's 100 best songs of the rock era. It is a perk for this book that protagonists discuss what the best rock songs could be. It shows something that I have believed a long time: you cannot find anybody who loves equally the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The shift is as deep as in classic music: on one side you get Bach and Stravinsky, on the other Beethoven and Verdi. Anyways, if you do not mind gore, go for it, it is as good as any Sandford."
3,Still LOVE Davenport,"I absolutely LOVE the ""prey"" series. My favorite was Winter Prey. This one, like the last was to predictable for me. I figured out what was what in the first few chapters. BUT, Sandford is really great at adding some other dimensions that contribute to the mystery. Still I pray (pun intended) for the ""old school"" PREY books. More for the imagination, not so predictable."
4,Nothing broken about it,This was another good crime novel by John Sanford and an excellent addition to the Prey series. Lucas Davenport and the Minnesota Police Dept. find themselves in a cat-and-mouse detective story that keeps you guessing till the end.
5,Broken Prey,Classic Stanford. A return to the top by Lucas Davenport. This one will grab you and keep you on edge.
5,Heartstopping,"Sandford is my favorite thriller writer. This is not the best Prey novel ever, but it's very, very good. Best aspects? 1) Familiar devices but with fresh, original twists. 2) Excellent dark humor. Sandford's ear for dialogue is pitch perfect. 3) Clever plot with a smart, scary killer. 4) Weather offstage for most of the book. She was good in Winter Prey, where she had a role of her own to play, but as a Lucas appendage, she's lame. As for the not so good 1) Lucas in a Lexus? Please no. 2) Graphic violence a tad overdone. 3) Few too many clues re red herring #1; I figured it out, and I'm not as smart as Lucas."
3,Not Sandford's best,"The Lucas Davenport series has always been a favorite of mine. I'm not sure if the series has run its course, but there was nothing really new or interesting in BROKEN PREY. It's a pretty standard serial killer thriller with more than the prerequisite amount of gore and violence. This book is not for the faint-of-heart. I'm pretty immune to the violence in some books, but this one had me skimming on several occasions. John Sandford fans will enjoy another entry in a beloved series, but there are better choices for new fans."
1,Distinguished looking gentleman gone to waste,"I am appalled not only about the story but also that a distinguished looking gentleman with white hair wrote this gruesome tale in a language dripping with profanities, teeming with the craziest, bloodthirsty sexcrazed scum of humanity in a plot where police-officers are inept fools and the scum maneuvers them around with ""brilliance"". This author is definitely off my list of things to read."
3,Almost,"Better than that horrible Russian one, but still far from the top of the ""Prey"" game.I agree that the excessive gore and bad language does not make up for plot deficiencies. I found the plot very predictable, which made Lucas and Sloan seem not too bright for not being able to figure it out sooner.It seems that Sandford has given Lucas this huge family and now does not know what to do with them, so he ships them all off to London. I think it was a mistake having him marry Weather. I haven't liked her since she freaked out on him because he killed a bad guy to save her life."
2,Ah. Um. Mmm.,"Broken Prey is just filler in an a series that's usually more engaging than this. Lucas Davenport goes bossing everyone around and doing whatever he wants in the course of his investigation into some brutal murders in Minnesota. The writing is barely passable, and the dialogue is sophomoric and punctuated with gems like ""Ah"" ""Um"" and Hmmm"".There's no clever detective work, and Lucas grunts and swears for 380 pages until the killer's name finally turns up. It seems as though we learn in the first 30 pages or so that a nutter has to be stopped--but we blunder along for 300 pages basically learning nothing until Sandford decides to let Lucas find the key to the killer's identity.Folks, this is pretty junky stuff. I heartily recommend something (almost anything) else off your book list."
4,Shorthand Prey,"If you've read all the Prey books, as I have, you're gonna read this no matter what anyone writes about it. And you won't be terribly disappointed in it. I'd say it ranks in the middle third of the of the series. At his best Sandford makes you care seriously about the victims, at his worst you don't especially care about the victims or the villians. In this one, the ""ick"" factor is quite high but the empathy isn't. Still, it's a quick read and one you're not likely to regret spending a little time on."
3,This Prey Novel is Just Okay,"I like John Sandford a lot, but I thought BROKEN PREY was just okay. This novel has everything you expect: a fast-paced plot, humor and lean writing that gets right to the point. It's a fun diversion, and I enjoyed it for that reason.The downsides of this novel? I thought the characterization was rather sketchy, with too many murder victims. BROKEN PREY also contains a lot of over-the-top sex and violence that does little to move the plot forward. The ""100 best rock songs"" debate is cute, but is really just filler. And when Sandford finally reveals who the killer is, well, his master plan doesn't seem the least bit believable or well thought out.This is definitely an above-average thriller and much better than most of the other stuff that's out there. But if you're trying Lucas Davenport for the first time, my advice is to go with one of the earlier books in the series."
2,Too violent,"Perhaps I should have started the ""Prey"" series with the first volume, but this is where I began. And what a shock. Without going into plot specifics, as other reviewers have, I will say that the novel is one detailed gruesome scene after another. Gruesome scenes can be effective when used sparingly, for effect, but in this case the number is mind numbing. Did the writer think that violence and gore were the only hooks to keep the reader's attention? One must assume so.The plot, I might add, is improbable. In fiction, criminals are a too, too clever lot, but penitentiaries and hospitals for the criminally insane are filled with people with below average intelligence. The perp here is only silly.The other characters are a little better. The atmosphere, Minnesota in summer, could be anywhere. That's unfortunate, because a realistic locale is essential in fiction. There was nothing to mark it in place, only in time.If this is an accurate sample of the ""Prey"" series, I'll skip the others."
4,Yet another great one,"Thought the book was great and it had alot of twists and turns enough to make it well worth reading. I have to give John two thumbs up for the thought he had to put into it. It will keep you guessing till the end. The ending was really great and I enjoy the prey novels because you never know whats going to happen next. Pure genious Mr. Sandford, keep them comming can't wait to see what you have in store for us next."
3,OK as long as you only go to Hanoi and Saigon,"If this book is still available, I hope there is a more recent edition than the one I bought back in 1999.The book was useful about customs and lifestyle in Vietnam. However, if you plan to travel there, you will need other travel books as well. This only covers Hanoi and Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City).A lot of the bar information in the book is no longer accurate. Things have changed a lot since 1999. Sam Son's is no longer open. And, information about places in Ha Noi is no longer up to date.I think your best option is to hit the Internet prior to your visit and go to online chat places such as [...] and vietfun.com to meet guys in Vietnam in advance of your visit."
5,Excellent preparation for a visit to Viet Nam,"This fairly small volume arrived just before I visited Viet Nam for the first time, and added greatly to my enjoyment and understanding of this beautiful country, its people and culture. It is especially useful in assisting the gay visitor who is interested in linking up with Vietnamese guys, in both Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi. The volume is patterned after the style of the famous ""Men of Thailand"" guide.Inevitably, as in all such guidebooks, some of the specifics, such as gay-friendly bars or cafes, are no longer accurate by the time the ink dries. Nevertheless, this has much valuable practical information, and is written from the perspective of a genuine friend of the Vietnamese."
5,An excellent teaching for the open minded traveller,"I sense disappointment among some of my fellow reviewers. My guess is that none of them have ever been to Viet Nam. What they seem to overlook are the strong points of this book: The desire filled sensitivity which the author uses in dealing with the subject. This should ideally rub off on the caring reader. Then there are the little lessons that are meant to prepare us for our visit (""The Fragile Vietnamese Heart""). The travel diary pages are another form of teaching us valuable lessons. It is important to look deeper here and not just expect a listing of all the latest happening places. With things changing so fast (raids still happen here), no print guide can ever claim to be up to date anyway. The Western view of a gay subculture doesn't (yet?) exist in Viet Nam. This country and her people deserve the insightful teachings that are contained in this book."
1,IBM Top Page not ready for primetime!,"As a user of Frontpage I decided to try Top Page and see how it did. The first thing I noticed was the box was empty excpt for a loan CD. NO documentation is included. It is discovery learning at its worst. I hope they don't think that it isn't necessary because the program is so intutive you don't need it. If they did, Wrong Again! Don't bother to talk to IBM about it. They know what is best for you is the attitude you get."
4,great fun gift,they do scratch off however for those who really play the lottery they know what a phony looks like. But I got a good laugh out of the gift. Packing didn't give them away either.
3,Cute,Bout these thinking they will be great to prank but I just felt bad after seeing how bad people felt After realizing they didn't really win.
5,April fools,"Leading up to April Fools I purchased scratch offs for my wife and left them in her car. When April fools came she nearly lost it. Called her mom, sisters and friends to tell them the news. When she read that she had to redeam it by going to the tooth ferry she figured it out. AWESOME!"
4,great rock history - arrived early,"A must have for Aero fans - hell , for any rock fan !!Aerosmith: Pumping Angel Interviews"
2,Wasn't what I expected,"Wouldn't waste my money on this one. Played it once and although Gladys Knight is my favorite femal singer, this CD just didn't do it for me."
4,Happy,"Bought this cd just for the song ""Let there Be Peace on Earth,"" which no station plays anymore. Beautiful song for all year."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!,"This sync cable does not fit the Palm M105. The product is defective! But since it cost twice as much to ship it as it did to buy it, I'm not going to return it. Don't waste your money on this one!!!"
2,Waste of money,"If you buy this without having any syncing program, your a fool. Didnt even fit the darn pda. Who uses these anyways?"
2,The CD is great the DVD is not.,"If you are buying this special edition of the soundtrack for the bonus DVD (as I did) all I can say is don't.The actual soundtrack CD is just what you expect. If you've seen movie you know exactly what you are getting. Some excellent music is compiled here, all of which appeared in the movie.The DVD, however, is a very big let down. A very poorly animated short cartoon clip. Actually it looks more like Flash animation than actual normally done animated material. There is no dialouge, not real story and even more poorly done action scenes. It's a tremendous let down.So if you want the soundtrack I would suggest the regular version."
5,Blade Trinity Song,"First of all Jessica Biel is the hottest girl i've ever seen. Second, what is the song that they play in Blade Trinity when Abby takes out her bow for the first time at the police station when they rescue Blade? They also play it when Blade, Abby, and King are walking in slow motion as they pass through the security inspection right before Dr. Vance's office? And what is the song that they play right when u first meet Abby and she's fighting the teenage vampires in the subway station? If you know, please please e-mail me at Ruffnole55@aol.com"
3,Song Help 2,"I need help in finding the main theme tune to Blade Trinity basically the one that is on the trailer because I've listened to the tracks on the album and I don't seem to recongise any of the songs to be the tune. The song is also featured in the movie but I'm not too sure when - I think it's near the end during the big fight against Drake etc.. but I am unsure. If, you've seen the UK trailer then you will know of the song I am talking of."
4,A song question.,"Does anyone know the song that is played when Abigail is shooting her bow at the vampires ""around corners"" in the police station, and all through that scene after that, until they reach the stair well? The same ""riff"", plays shortly, sometimes muted, at different times during the rest of the movie. Really liked the movie and soundtrack."
4,help me?,does anybody know the song which is played in the background of the blade 3 movie trailer because its not on the soundtrack album and i like the song
3,"I'm the ""I need song help"" person","Good news for the person who asked about the hip-hop/reggae song that plays when Blade jumps out of the police bulding. It's on the album, and it's called, ""When The Guns Come Out"" by WC, E-40 & Christ Bearer of Northstar."
3,I need song help here,"Will somebody please tell me what the song is that plays when Abby is downloading music onto her Ipod (the first time in the movie)? It kinda goes like, ""Come on, come on, fight that dust"" (or something). Thanks. Oh, and what is the song that plays when Blade jumps out of the police bulding and lands in front of Abby and Hannibal, it's kinda reggae/hip-hop? And someone mentioned the song ""Clubbed to Death"" by Rob D. When does that play?"
3,answering ur question,"to the person who asked about ""clubbed to death"" it's not actually in the movie, it was in the trailer... but the song is actually from the first matrix movie. one of my fave songs"
5,Peachtree 2007 Software,"I was very satisfied with the software I purchased through Amazon.com. While I contacted Sage directly to get a replacement cd for the one I originally purchased and misplaced, they told me that they no longer had the 2007 version cd. They wanted to me to upgrade to the 2010 software which would have cost me over $1,200.00. Thankfully, Amazon.com had the 2007 version I needed and cost me much less and it worked perfectly for what I needed. Therefore, I suggest that everyone check Amazon.com before purchasing anything. Thanks Amazon!!"
2,Not even close to the excellent writing she now does,I didn't realize that this book was a reissue of 2 older books. You can see how far NR has come in her righting.
4,"Had some concerns, but great just the same!","I was a little hesitant to read this latest re-issue of Nora Roberts. I am a big fan of her romance and mystery mix, as well as her more strictly romances. But I wasn't sure how I would like the time travel duo. But, I have to say, Nora pulled it off, weaving two stories of love with a little time travel. I have read books that I thought to be better by her, but given my doubts before reading this title, she did an excellent job.So what happens to Caleb, stranded in the 20th century, and Libby in ""Time Was""? Or Jacob, Caleb's brother who comes to rescue him, and Sunny in ""Times Change""? The only way to find out is to take the time to read it. In my humble opinion, it is well worth it."
2,Ho hum,"I liked the idea of the traveling time, the men being confused and curious was a good concept. My problem is that fact that most of the book they spent having sex. I mean, really, in this day and age do us women jump into a sex relationship within a day or two of meeting a strange man?? I read a book for it's adventure and plot and usually enjoy Nora Roberts' books, but this one took my forever to finish because of page after page of sex and orgasms just didn't ring true. It was boring, I would have enjoyed it more had there been more substance."
5,Excellent!,"I heard others say this book wasn't good, but they are wrong! It discusses the possibility of time travel which seems foreign to us, but what is wrong with a little non-reality every once in a while! Nora Roberts did an excellent job in making you wonder about time travel while adding lots of romance, as she is known to do! It was a great change from the realistic love stories of the day!"
4,A pleasantly well-crafted story.,"Nora Roberts does a fine job of taking the subject of time travel and actually making it seem real. Caleb Hornblower has crash landed into the future, and his brother follows to try to help him home. What the two of them find in this quirky century is more than they bargained for, and the pages keep turning, seemingly of their own accord. The story grips you incredibly and touches lots of soft spots. A definite Nora Roberts must-read."
3,Enjoyable!,"Certainly not one of Nora Roberts' best efforts but an enjoyable read. These stories were originally published more than a decade ago but they are still fun, light reads. Of course, I'd read Nora's shopping list if given the opportunity so . . ."
4,Really enjoyed it!,"I really enjoyed the two stories. I only discovered Roberts within the past couple of years. It's amazing what a prolific writer she is. I realize she is busy, but I would love a follow up to find out if Jacob and Sunny are able to get back to the 20th century to visit, if Caleb and Libby figure a way to leave more time capsules as a way to communicate with their family in the future. This book was an easy read, with an interesting premise, not too far out for all you future phobes."
1,Please read something else!,This had to be one of the dumbest books she has written. It had no redeaming story line and I am a fan of Nora Roberts. Hope her work in the future is better than this. I could not even rate it as a good beach book.
4,great read!,"The first story is better than the second. I enjoyed the futuristic setting and I'm more of a historical person. Good job, NR!"
2,What Happened?!,"I should have listened to my gut instinct and passd on this one. It's not a bad or boring read, it's just that when I read a book I want to read something that keeps me really entertained I'm afraid this didn't do it for me. I'm a big fan of hers, but she blew it with this one. It's as if she didn't put her heart in it. Clearly not her best work. If you have a limited budget for books, you may want to save your money for something better."
3,Smell sweeter than a bed of roses!,"Howdy folks,I start ever huntin' season by taking shots o' coon yurn. That old yurn sure do put hair on yer chest. Ain't no time atall before I need another bucket o'spicy coon yurn so I can get ready for the bow season and get me my Honeyed Ham Hawk license. Last year, I done got me a four footer three-point Honeyed Ham Hawk with two-uh her youngs.The Honeyed Ham Hawk is noted by is distinctive vocal tone that combines a ""ca"" with a ""oink."" Many is the day I spent in my overalls with a fine bucket o'coon yurn waiting to hear that ""coink"" as the majestive and flavorful Honeyed Ham Hawk came into view of my 16 gauge blowgun.Coon yurn smells like a bed of roses and it goes down the hatch warm or cold. Sometimes I drinks it with a pasta dish or maybe veal shank.But never, ever polar bear liver. Do not drink coon yurn with polar bear liver else you get vitmin A-osis. If you wash your hands in coon yurn, be sure to smell your finger."
2,WAY OVER PRICED,"This boy is very colorful. A couple of the noise areas where you have to squeeze are difficult and my grand daughter will need help. The feet have paper in them so you hear a crackling when you squeeze the feet. Overall the toy is OK, but I wouldn't purchase it if I had seen it in the store. It is very over priced!"
1,big letdown,"after the beauty of ""nocturne"", i expected this to be , at least comparable, since many of the same people are on this date...sorry...this is a sad, boring excuse for music, let alone jazz, and i'm at a loss how such gifted musicians could sound so lifeless...maybe its the material, which may sound great sung by a decent vocalist, but leave nothing much to an arranger but dull, boring melodies, void of emotion, and inspiring (?) the most insipid playing ...despite this, some solos get slightly off the ground, but over all, this is an awful , boring, deadly dull record, and all connected to this should go back to the wooodshed."
1,"Dull music for elderly people, why the 5 stars?","I bought this album because I love Charlie Haden's tone, and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist Miguel Zenon and pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in the credits.But why were they hired? There's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs. It certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band.I am so puzzled by the five star reviews that I went back and switched on the CD. The track I picked at random was nice, but I couldn't face a second, and played a Fall record instead to wake me up. I shall try again, but it seems a bit dreary."
4,American Judaism: A History,I have not completed reading all of it but it seems very comprehensive and informative. An excellent source of information.
1,Too expensive,This contains only one test for $3.53. This is EXPENSIVE. The list price is over $10! Get one with more tests. I would prefer the old fashioned paper test strips.
1,do not buy this phone,"one phone of the set din't have caller id information,other one died after trying to talk for just a few secondsthis by far was worst phone i ever triedsent it backwaiting on credit to appear on my charge card."
2,cordless phone,The voice quality is poor. Despite the volume control the voices are muffled. The problem is compounded when using the hands free set.
1,Causes wireless interference..,"I bought this for the low price, and the 900 mhz which ""shouldn't"" interfere with my 802.11b/g network.. However it does... so it makes the item pretty useless to me now...I have a GE Model 5-623 that is 2.4ghz and works wonderfully with my network.. I am going to go back to using that.."
1,Bad Experience,"The phone is simply unusable. The volume level changes abruptly every few seconds from adequate to absolutely inaudible, then back again, making it impossible to carry on a conversation. This happens at anytime of the day or night, so it unlikely that local cultural interference on the 900 MHz band is responsible. Both handsets behave in the same erratic way.Three emails of increasing intensity were sent to Uniden customer service, but they never replied. I can understand a product slipping through their quality control, but not their unwillingness to address a customer complaint. No more Uniden for me."
2,Never Again,"The cheap price for these phones should tip you off that they are junk. The battery life is terrible, both my batteries are going dead. Plus, if one of the phones go dead while talking it blanks out your phone line so you have to unplug the phone cord to the unit. You can barely read the caller ID display and you can only use one phone at a time. You can transfer a call to the other phone but it's a hassle."
1,What could they have been thinking?,"I ordered these phones as I like the older 900MHZ phones. They were attractive and stylish but when we hooked them up they fuzz with every movement. The distsance for these on a perfectly clear day that isn't agravating is about four feet and you can't hear the other person. Turned up all of the way they are amazingly quiet.What a waste of money.I am so disapointed with this product.Shame on Uniden for ever producing anything that simply does not work. I have bought their products since they opened their doors and nothing but. Man, not anymore."
4,Cordless Phone,"The two station phone works well. However, it doesn't have as much range away from the base station as other cordless phones I have and still use. This is why I give it 4 stars rather than 5."
4,good phones!,"for basic 900 mhz phones, this pair works pretty well. voice quality is good, and range is ok (not great). i live in an old three story wooden house, and with the base unit in the back of the house on the 2nd floor, reception at the front of the first or third floor is just so-so.good points: they're easy to program, and when you push the ""where the heck is the handset? button"" it keeps beeping for a full minute, or until you find it. this is a BIG improvement over previous phones that only beeped WHILE you were holding the button. i mean, what were they thinking?it's nice to have 900 mhz so i don't need to worry about interference with the home wireless network: some 2.4 ghz phones cause big problems.these phones are a good buy. i'd get 'em again."
1,THIS PHONE SUCKS,THIS IS THE WORST PHONE WE HAVE EVER HAD YOU CAN NOT HEAR ANYTHING YOU CAN NOT HANG ON WALL THIS PHONE WAS RATED #1 WITH CONSUMER REPORTS I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE
1,WORST TELEPHONE,THIS WAS THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER HAD. THE STATIC ON THE LINE WAS SO BAD THAT I COULD HARDLEY HEAR THE PERSON I WAS TALKING TO. THAT IS WHY I RETURNED THEM.
1,Consumer Reports was wrong,"I Bought this phone for my mother. She wanted this one because consumer reports gave it ""Best Buy"" rating. She hates it. It has a real problem with static."
2,"great base, poor extras","The base station phone is wonderful, However, the remote is quite poor and we find we only use it to hear the ring, then go to another phone to talk."
2,Two Years...,"The idea behind this phone is fantastic. One thing that annoyed me was that you can't have both phones on at the same time so that two people can speak from your home (this seems like it should be technically feasible). Worse, is that when a phone's battery dies, if the phone is on (i.e. you were speaking on it), it ties up the line for up to half an hour afterwards and disconnecting it doesn't help. This has been an issue for several glitches. But all this was worth living with until opne of the phones just died (and it wasn't the battery as I switched it out). That happened abround six months ago (I bought in May 2004) - so it has a life of two years. I am down to one phone and it has developed an annoying whining that seems to be random. If you know people with other brands that have lasted them longer, go with those."
1,Bad Experience,"This was a problem phone right out of the box. The second handset never worked. The volume gets softer and softer all by itself. A complete waste of money, I didn't even bother sending it back for a replacement. It was not worth the effort and I didn't want them selling it to someone else. BEWARE"
1,Cheap and Not Worth It,"I've had one problem after another with this phone. The cordless extension has static, probably due to wireless internet interference. Other times, the phone dies without any explanation. There are much better phones on the market."
4,good product for the price,"this set is pretty decent for the price. it is not top of the line, but it is surely functional and there is nothing we have found wrong with it yet, besides a slight delay connecting after we pick up the phone."
2,Poor sound with headset,When used with a headset I can barely hear the other person.Adjusting the volume only seems to increase the sound of the ambient room noise that the mic pics up.I'm NOT happy.I've tried 2 different model headsets. Both behave the same.The headsets have excellent sound quality and volume on a Toshiba phone I've been using for awhile.I should have bought locally.....
3,dxi-986 review,"good value since you get two phones for one low price, but here are some complaints:-uncomfortable earpiece-often staticky-construction feels 'cheap', (not solid)"
3,Much better for those interested in learning Al's guitar techniques,"I caught this DVD on sale. It is a great instructional disc for those wanting to learn some of Al's guitar techniques and probably only average over all for those who appreciate the music of this great guitarist. If you're predominantly interested in Al's music, there are other DVD's that are more worth your attention and money."
2,Disapointment,I am a huge fan of Al Di Meola. I really liked his book on chords and arpeggios. This video however was a huge let down. It felt less like instructional and more like a video of Al soloing with brief talking in between.
3,Lovely but repetitive,"Wonderful music but the lovely theme is developed repetitiously --- not a lot of variation here. Once you hear the theme, you hear it again and again and again."
4,Almost Great,"I want to like this more. It draws from an intense message, but fails to become a complete CD. However, it is still strong and worth buying.The movie is careful and filled with love and warmth, of familial redemption and lessons about what matters. The score, however, is repititious in its use of the main theme.The theme is wonderful, as are the secondary pieces, but the melody floats in and out of so many cuts, it gets monotonous.See the movie, hear the music in context, and then buy the music.Anthony Trendl"
5,REMEMBER,"Ennio Morricone scored the sublime, warm and wonderful movie here in ways that take everything, movie and score, to a magical place. This score goes in your ears and invades you down to your toes with deceptively simple melodies and a perfect musical evocation of childhood, loss, first love, sadness and most of all, of the power of memory. Let it wash over you; like all great art, it has the power to transform you too, and stir the heart in ways that surprise, uplift and, most of all, make you FEEL."
4,Cinema Paradiso is Not Paradiso for All,"I adore the music of Ennio Morricone in any shape or form. I prefer his more emotional soundtracks like ""The Good,The Bad, and The Ugly"" and ""The Mission."" This CD has its moments but not enough to suit my tastes. I've never seen this film but knowing Morricone and his mastery of musical emotionality I don't believe this movie would have been my cup of tea. It is still Morricone the Maestro of the movie soundtrack just a little weak in spots for me. For a audio delight buy the Ennio Morricone Anthology a truly great listen."
2,SO ?,"The premise of this book is interesting, the set up very inviting but the whole story was a disappointment for me. The reader is given the same story from different prospectives without much new information. The story falls flat at the end."
1,diogenes,"This is the kind of book the authorities use to torture people, by reading it to them, with the promise they will stop reading if the listener cooperates.You hope it will get better. It doesn't. It's just endless vacuous drivel."
1,Don't waste your money...,"...on the disappointing performance and wretched sound quality of this DVD. As a long time fan of the Pointer Sisters who have seen them perform live many times, let's hope that RCA re-releases their 1985 VHS ""So Excited"" Video on DVD - or their 1987 HBO Live performance - both of which were outstanding."
1,Never made it through the whole thing,"I love the Pointer Sisters. What they did to them with this release should be a crime! Thank God it is possible to take old two track recordings and make them sound good on DVD. BUT THIS AIN'T IT.ONE OF THE WORST AUDIO TRACKS I HAVE EVER HEARD. I would give it no stars, but that option doesn't exist."
1,Poor Audio and disappointing overall quality;will never view,This was a total waste of money. You buy a DVD player for superior audio/video. This had neither. I will give this away in hopes that someone will enjoy it.
1,Shame on Amazon,As a long time fan of the Pointers this was an insult to their name and memory. And shame on Amazon for not telling us what a sick joke this was.
5,Excellent - get it,"Great CD, screams & kicks. Excellent tracks - Too Dead to Die, Evil is Good, We Have to Kill You Now, Nightbreed, Scary Song, Rocketship Oddity 13, I Wanna Rot, Chop Off My Hand, The Wolfman Stole My Baby. There's 17 tracks on this CD with three bonus tracks for a total of 20. Bonus tracks are: Viva Las Violence, The Devil Made Me Do It, and the awsome Murder Pie. Checking out their ""Look What the Bats Dragged in Tour"" in NC in Sept before they go to the UK."
4,What fun!,"I was first introduced to this delightful send up of the Nelson Eddy/Jeannette McDonald movies about 30 years ago at the Purdue University Summer theatre, I've been a fan ever since, and own both a CD and cassette. I hope someone decides to release it again soon! Eileen Brennan is wonderful as Mary and John McMartin as Cpl Billy Jester is a delight(Cap'n Andy all grown up...well sort of). Instead of Mounties, we have forest rangers and the ""Ladies of Eastchester Finishing School are just too much! And of course there is the ""older couple"" who ""Dream of Vienna"". I would urge anyone who loves musical comedy at its most spoofy, to find a copy of this charming, witty, silly piece of Americana as soon as possible.... As Little Mary says, ""Look for a sky of blue""!"
5,Hitch,"This design is one of simplicity and requires no mods whatsoever. I chose the right one and had it installed in about 30 minutes. The skirt on front of the truck is still in tact and could not ask for more, Thanks."
1,Does not fit old style Chevy Trucks/Suburbans,"Despite being listed as fitting on the 1990 Chevrolet Suburban on both Amazon.com and Curt's own web site, by Curt's own admission this DOES NOT FIT old style Chevrolet Suburbans.However if you order it from Amazon, try it, find it doesn't fit, they will charge you a $20+ shipping fee to return it because ""It's not their mistake"", despite the fact that their web site incorrectly identifies it as fitting. It appears that Draw Tite and Warn both offer a front receiver for the older style Chevrolet Suburbans so I will try to track one of those down.This is the note I received from Curt's Customer Service --------- Original Message --------Subject: Front mount hitchDate: Tue, 3 Jan 2012 16:35:53 -0600From: Brad **** <****@curtmfg.com>To: jeffb@******Jeff, We don' have a hitch for the Suburban for anything older than a 1992. You will want to do a return through Amazon. Sorry for any inconvenience.Thank You,BradTechnical Support Representative"
3,"Good, but not great !!","This is a good product that has apparently been taken off the market by Turtle Wax. The wax , itself, doesn't last long at all, however, if you apply a coat of Collinite Hard Wax afterwards, the color effect of the wax will stand up. Turtle Wax did have this product in a paste form that was awsome. Again, it didn't hold up long but had a better filling quality."
5,The Lesson of Sharing the Earth,"The crow chief, a brilliantly white bird, is responsible for a famine among human beings. The humans respond with HOPE and their hope is rewarded by CHANGE, as the crow chief is compelled to learn a lesson of ""community"" and inter-relatedness, a lesson that results in turning his feathers a beautiful jet black.The text of this book for young children is elegantly simple and warm in spirit, but as always, it's the stunning illustrations that make the book very special. Paul Goble does not base his drawings on any traditional Native American art, yet the drawings evoke the awe and grandeur of the Native American spirit at its purest. Goble's works belong in a museum, even if it's only the museum of your child's memory."
4,Good Quality....Wish it were larger !!,"Purchased this Tote Caddy for carrying cleaning supplies around as I ""reddup"" {Pittsburghese} my home. It is sturdy but, I wish it were a little larger."
4,good,I was really pleased with this purchase. I have used a similar tote for years but cannot find them and this is a good substitute.
3,Too big.,Hoping for something would fit under the sink but this is definitely too large. Way more space for supplies than needed in a home.
5,Good size caddy for cleaning supplies,Great tote / caddy for cleaning supplies. Big deep sides easily hold rolls of paper towels or bottles of cleaning products. Sturdy thick plastic. Doesn't feel like its gonna fold up or crack on itself when carrying a full load. Definitely worth it for anyone interested in having a single convenient caddy to carry around auto cleaning supplies.
4,Good caddy,"This tray is solid and holds all of my car washing products without a problem. It is a tad on the larger size though but for me that was a good thing since I had a lot of stuff that I wanted to put in it. Maybe it is too big though. I have trouble finding a place to keep this where it doesn't get in my way. Also I really wish this had a rubber grip on the handle. This would make it a lot easier to hold on to and possibly more comfortable if you have heavier items in it.I will note however that I found a very similar product at Costco for about half the price, so if you are a Costco member I would recommend checking that out."
5,The easter cartoon I remember most,"I have always loved this cartoon, nothing says Easter more to me than watching Peter give the animals gifts so they will be able to talk. It may intrest everyone to know that on top of just being a great classic cartoon the characters in it live on to this day as the mascots of the 125 year old PAAS Easter dye kit company, replacing the plain brown bunny that was once their trademark with the lovable Cotton the white rabbit (who, since I was born in 83, has been there for as long as I can remember).All I can say is buy this VHS, it's truly worth it, and hopefully maybe even PAAS will someday put it out on DVD..."
5,"Power, power everywhere.....","A very thought-provoking anthology. All the stories turn on energy(power), and how to generate it, keep it, and use it.Short nonfiction articles give a well thought precis on alternate forms of energy. Make sure you read the stories 'Snowball', and 'Roachstompers'. 'Cracking-good' reads, in and of themselves."
4,so comfortable,I was very pleased with how comfortable these boots were. They have soft rubber soles with some kind of cushion in them. They don't make any noise when walking in them either! They have zip up sides which make them easy to get off and on. These are definitely the most comfortable boots I have ever purchased.
4,Cowboy boots that feel good!,"I have had cowboy boots in the past that were fancier than this pair, but I have never had a pair that were more comfortable. Right after I bought them I wore them on a trip. Even though I had not broken them in, they were as comfy as loafers. I did a lot of walking that day and never felt the pinched feeling one can get when wearing cowboy boots.These boots aren't exactly high fashion, but they are attractive. What they lack in couture style, they make up for in practicality and price.I do wish they had regular leather in addition to the suede."
4,Bonus tracks,"The import has two bonus tracks. The first, Roll Witchu, is very much like the first half of 20 Y.O. Upper mid tempo with the contemporary production those other songs have. Not my favorite, but it's still a good song and fits in nicely with the album. But having said that, the best of the two songs, IMO, is the second bonus track, Days Go By. It's so good I'd even say this is one of the top 3 songs on this entire album. This song actually sounds more like her 1993 ""janet."" album than 20 Y.O. It has an easy, smooth sound, and musically probably somewhere inbetween ""Again"" and ""Where Are You Now"". It's a shame they put this as only a bonus song since it should be available to all Janet fans. And it's a shame that these imports are so expensive. If you can find this song, I'd highly recommend it to any Janet fans and especially fans of her 1993 album."
5,Gr8 Album!,"There lots of good song on this album. Too bad her now ex record company fail to to push this album this time around. Love all the songs,i wished track 12 ""ENJOY"" would have been a single that song makes me smile...lol Gr8 song! and if u got the import the extra two track are jammin too, ""RoLL WITCHU"" is HoTT! All in All this album from MS Jackson is worth giving a Listen to."
1,This brand does not work in the ipaq 3600 - 3700 series,"I bought 5 packs of these, none of them work properly.They slide down and stick into the case and are very difficult to remove.They should not be sold .."
5,A Manual for Legal Medicine for Practitioners and Students of Medicine and Law,"A study of solving criminally induced illness and death by the coroner's physician for New York County, New York. Although written in the 1800's it is as relevant today as it was at that time."
5,Vintage Nirvana interviews,Vintage Nirvana interviews and footage from all Band members. Very cool to see Kurt @ Dave Grohl hamming it up for these amatuer video interviews from college students. Rare to see a DVD that all members allowed. Worth getting!
3,of historical interest and for collectors,"1) If you're considering this you should know that its recording quality is very, very poor. Understandable given the circumstances, but worth pointing out nevertheless.2) You aren't going to want to listen to Levant's spoken dialogue over and over.3) The Oscar Levant song ""Young in Heart"" is a throwaway, with florid piano accompaniment and a not particularly memorable tune and lyric, but a reasonable out-take specimen of the historical period -- a curiosity.4) The ""Rhapsody in Blue"" rendition here is mannered and ineffective.5) The first movement of the ""Sonatina"" sounds rather like Gershwin sans melody. The piano concerto is more or less watered-down Schoenberg w/bits of Gershwin parody.6) The Charlie Chan movie opera segments do nothing for me."
4,Very Big Bag,"Good quality bag, velcro inserts to personalize the internal compartment to fit your camera, it works well for the new Digital SLR just purchased and seems like it will protect it well. The only drawback is that the shoulder strap it VERY short, not much taller than the top handle on the bag (unless I have missed how to lengthen it)."
5,Bevana's review,"Nice bag, haven't received the camera yet to put into it, but I think it will work fine."
3,Roomy indeed,"I read the reviews stating how big this bag was but didn't really think twice about it. It is quite roomy which is good to carry your equipment but it also has compartments that can be adjusted for a nice snug fit to avoid camera/lens shift. Good bag, wish it came in more colors."
4,Samsonite Worldproof 3.2 Download SLR Camera Bag (Black w/Khaki and Black),Little bit too big for a Canon Rebel XTi with a Sigma 18-200 OS. Good size if you have 2 lenses. Fast shipping.
3,Annoying amount of common sense,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Home security is a well written general overview of risk assessment (from fire/crime). It provides some interesting facts with common sense solutions to eliminating higher risk behavior/vulnerabilities.The books greatest downfall is the fact that most of those readers interested enough in home security to purchase and then read manuals of this sort are paranoid enough that little presented in this text is something they won't have already considered and probably implemented. If your seriously interested in home security this book may not be enough for you.
1,No thanks,"I bought this book because I was wanting to design my own home security system, and was completely disappointed. This book does not give information on how to install a video surveillance system, motion detectors, or alarm systems. It gives a lot of tips on how to avoid doing things that put you at more risk; but to me they're no-brainers. I live way out in the country and the advice he gives for security in the country is laughable. ""Make sure your farm buildings are well-lit"". What difference would that make? Nobody's around at night to see anyone out there trying to steal something, whether it's lit or not."
2,"Makes the food look pretty, but",I appreciate the spring roll wrapper and love it fried...but unfried? The texture is off-putting...Like chewing on a rubber glove...
5,=O,"I signed up specifically to review this CD.What can I say.. Fantastic stuff!!After hearing a few of the songs online, I knew I had to get this. Like the others said, the cd is PERFECT!. Every time I listen to it, it putts me into a happy mood.If you enjoy any type of electronic music, you will love this cd!Cant wait for another cd from Ott."
3,Somewhat repetitive..,"As in the title, repetitive. A little dub goes a long way if they all sound similar. He throws some talking loops in a few of them, which makes things worse.I found myself hitting the ""next"" button to get past a few of them. If you know what dub is, and are a die-hard fan, you might like it better.""A load up at nunney catch"" is a waste of time as far as I'm concerned. You can't get a good feel for the songs with 30 seconds of preview. I'll try to get back here and rate them one by one."
2,Stuck in the dub funk,"Elements of the album are awesome, but it quickly gets mired in the repetitive dub land and makes me feel sleepy and bored. I'm not actually a fan of dub so maybe if you are you'll like this album."
5,A Real Testimony,"I found Jennifer Young's debut album to be very uplifting and inspirational. Her rich and developed voice praise the Lord so beautifully. The lyrics and presentation of each song are so real and such a testimony of The Lord's amazing love for each of us. If you are looking for an album that has variety, GREAT talent and amazing inspiration, ""The Word Through Music"" is definitely a great choice!"
5,Truely funny,This is one of the ebst comedic records of all time. It is just funny as [heck] and truthful.
5,"Hillarious, but dangerous","Hillarious. YOU CAN'T BEAT IT. Repeating what other people have said, this is NOT car listening. I also advise making sure you know how to breathe, and not have any respiratory problems, because once you start laughing you can't stop."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!!,"This is one of the best comedy albums that I have ever listened to. I've seem Lewis Black in person, and I can honestly say that this CD captures the neurotic energy of his comedy routine. Lewis points out the insane, the illogical, and the downright scary aspects of life in the United States while making you laugh hysterically. His ""Back in Black"" segment from the Daily Show is humorous, but his routine is hysterical. If you enjoy Lewis from his Comedy Central appearances, you'll love this CD!"
3,Just OK,"I'm astounded at the number of 5 star reviews here. I'm a huge Black fan, and at the impressionable age of 15, I was ecstatic to hear that he released a CD. I listened to it and was rather disappointed. Aside from a few bits here and there, this CD is essentially regurgitated material from a couple his amazing Comedy Central Specials. Normally, I'd have no problem with this -- we get those amazing comedic gems uncensored -- except that his delivery here is unfocused and desultory. He rushes through punchlines, and they don't pack the punch here in the way they do on those CC specials. It sounds like he's reading his material off a teleprompter. I'll probably get flack for this review, but I don't care. If you want truly good Lewis Black, check out the rest of his work. If you want a better version of this particular material, get the Comedy Central Presents DVD."
1,Kindle Version Is Poorly Formatted,"Thank God for the hardcover version - the Kindle version, though eminently portable, is distractingly formatted - different lines with different sized fonts (in the Psalms, at least... didn't get the chance to read the whole thing before I returned it :) Anyhow, it was a supreme disappointment. Please fix! I will repurchase if you A) ensure readability in all books on Kindle, and B) dramatically improve Table Of Contents navigation to book/chapter. Amazon was prompt and helpful with refund."
5,"Fine edition, very portable","The print is very sharp and clear. The book is obviously of very high quality and small enough to carry around with you ... with the leather cover, it's about 6.5"" by 9.5"" by a little over 1"".Matthew 6:9 has just enough Thy old styled English to make the prayer beautiful. Isaih refers to a ""virgin"" rather than a ""young woman"". It makes for a nice translation.I couldn't wait for it to become available here and finally bought it at a local book store. Amazon definitely has the best listed price."
1,Not happy.,"I purchased this and had to send it back. I recieved the First Edition hard cover. I was not impressed. Generally however, the text in this book is good however it does not use the different formatting which is common in other bibles (i.e. showing the difference between hyns and poems and regular prose)."
2,Text is good. Format is not.,"The text and notes of this edition are as good as any that I have studied. However, simple navigation such as page number or book is missing. Verses are numbered but are of little help if you have lost your place and do not know what book/chapter/etc. that you are on. I would think for 13 bucks this would at least be a lowest common demoninator."
3,Good translation. Pages hard to read.,"Just got my copy of this Bible. The cover is nice and I like the translation. However, I must say this the text is hard to read because of the color of the pages. The pages are not white. They are beige or off-white. For me this makes it difficult to focus especially in room light or dim light. I am keeping it because I want a Catholic version of the Bible but I sure wish the pages were white."
1,very dissapointed/im stuck with bible i cant read or use /,this is not what i ordered-there were no directions on how to use the bible/from what read i was led to believe that there were daily lessons on how to read and understand the bible /the print is small small/now im stuck with a bible i cant use or read/very dissapointed.jm
5,Catholic bible,This was exctly what I was looking for and is very easy to read and understand. I am a returning Catholic and need to get back to reading the bible and understand the teachings of OUR LORD . This book has been a great help
4,Ignatius Bible from Amazon,"This leatherbound copy has a beautiful cover, gilt-edged pages, and is easier to read than my New American Bible even though it's not the large print edition. The New American has loads of footnotes but they are difficult for me to read without magnification. There are slight variations in the text between the two versions also. So, when I prepare for my Bible Study, I find it very helpful to use both editions. For ordinary use, this Ignatius Bible does very well."
5,"Ignatious bible, standard revised version, second catholic edition","I have read may bibles and this is my favorite, easy to read and understand."
2,Terrible Font Choices!,"I really wanted this translation, but I found the font and paper choices to be constantly annoying me - not what I'm looking for in a Bible! I ended up returning it."
1,Translation,"I find that this particular text loses a lot in translation. I'm currently using it for a seminar class, and the alternate translations of other students generally make more sense and better preserve the meaning of the original text. Also, this translation includes speculative footnotes that are inconvenient for reading as just a text, because they bias some readers before conversation has even begun. Overall, I don't recommend this translation for any sort of scholastic study of the Bible."
3,Difficult to locate readings,I found that it was far more difficult to locate the various extracts. By the nature of the book it requires ease of indexing or referral. The previous bible I bought on Amazon was better - pity I had problems with accessing certain of the contents.
5,great buy,"As a life long Catholic, I was used to the Catholic Bible costing somewhere around $40.00 (cheap) but when I ordered this one for a much lesser price, I was pleased with how very authentic the contents were. The books missing from the standard King James Version were included in this one. For all the unknowing people who say ""Catholics don't use a bible"" you should order this and read the Catholic Bible. You will be very surprised!"
2,"The Ignatius Bible, Kindle edition","This review is specific to the Kindle version.First of all let me state that I like the Ignatius Bible in a paper format. The Kindle version does not have the book name or chapter listed in a header. Just the name of the bible. If you tap a link, you go to the link but you have to keep track of where you are since the kindle will not tell you.I have used bible readers in the past and the kindle version does not compare.Get a sample of it and try it before you buy it."
3,Only one complaint,"I have the hard back edition of the Ignatius Bible 2nd ed.,and I can't say enough nice things about it. When I saw the Ignatius Bible offered on Kindle, naturally I jumped on it. I still think it's fantastic except for the table of contents. Only the books are listed, they are not broken down into chapter and verses, this makes it more difficult to go to or find specific verses; other than that it's great."
3,Unhelpful footnotes,"Let me start by saying the RSV Ignatius Press Bible is a wonderful translation. The Bible Commentaries are a necessary supplement since there is not much in the way of footnotes. For example, ""Then these men were bound in their mantles, their tunics, their hats, and their other garments, and they were cast into the burning fiery furnace."" Daniel 3:21. There is a footnote reference ""d"" which states ""The meaning of the Aramaic word is uncertain."" How necessary of a statement is that? Limited footnotes is not the weakness but rather unhelpful footnotes. My recommendation would be to purchase the Bible IF you intend to purchase the Commentaries or if you already have NAB, or if you cross reference biblical passages. Again, it is an excellent translation, fine quality, and portable. That aside, it would be nice if it came in a larger font size."
3,"Leather bound is very soft, would have bought hardcover instead","No complaints about my transaction or the content of this bible, but I paid extra for a nice leather-bound book to put up on the shelf and display and this book's leather-bound cover is soft and flimsy. I have to shelve it between two self-standing books just to keep it upright. Looks pretty, but had I known how soft the leather cover was ahead of time, I would have opted for the cheaper but presumably sturdier hardcover."
4,Excellent translation. Good paperback,"Thia is a good translation that is used by many Catholic apologetics organizations. It reads well and is accurate. This edition is considered by many to be the best version for teen and adult Catholics.You will not be disappointed.As paperback copies go, this is above average in look and feel.The only way to do better is to go with the leather bound editions."
5,Best Bible,Great translation from the Vulgate & the book seems easier to read than other bibles I have. Highly recommend this translation.
2,"Nice translation, very poor binding quality","This review is not about the RSV-SCE translation, it is about the binding quality of the hardbound and bonded leather versions of this Bible.- Paper quality and print clarity are excellent. Endpapers appearto be good quality. No problems here, so credit where credit is due.- The binding quality is abysmal.- The page signatures are not sewn securely and are falling out out of the box.- The head/tailbands are falling off.I have returned both the hardcover and bound leather versions for a refund. I will not purchase another Ignatius Press Bible of this inferior quality. I actually use my Bibles (and own many) and know that a Bible that is falling apart when it's brand new will not last.Very disappointed."
5,Just beautiful!,"I was looking for a Catholic bible that was more traditional, and had hoped to find one with Byzantine art on the cover. I was prepared to give up when I stumbled across this one. It's a beautiful bible,the paper is high quality, the cover is gorgeous, and it's a standard book size, not a large version, so my wrists don't get tired when I read it!"
3,"Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition","If I had known that this Bible is printed on glossy paper, I would not have bought it. It is difficult to read. The old adage is true, ""Do not judge a book by its cover."""
5,Best study Bible,I have several Bibles and LOVE this one! I prefer the more precise translation and wording. I recently saw my priest uses the same one! I must be on the right track!
4,The most beautiful bible I have,"The only one complain is that I thought it was a leather on a hard cover, but it's in fact a soft cover leather."
5,Lead one by the hand,"The notes are both copious and helpful. The editors, Hahn and Mitch, lead us through the New Testament through their careful notations."
5,simple the best I've owned,"I have the Ignatius RSV-CE2 in the leather bound edition. This is the most well built Bible that I own, and I have quite a few. The leather feels really nice in your hands and it lays open well too. The font is large enough that I can read it comfortably. The leather edition has anti-glare pages which is amazing for reducing eye strain while reading for any extended amount of time. Something that I also love is how thick the pages are. You don't feel like they are going to tear in between your fingers and the print does not bleed through from the other side. My qualifications to comment on the translation itself would be marginal at best. The RSV has always been known to be a solid translation and has given birth to this translation and the highly revered ESV translation. Combine that with such a solid build and you have an awesome Bible."
5,A Must-Read Regardless of One's Creed,"I grew up in a Catholic country, but after a long and painful soul-searching process I threw my arms up and declared myself agnostic about twenty years ago. Nevertheless, I have read the New Testimony on multiple occasions, and I find it a beautiful and fascinating read on man and human values. You just can't go wrong with love. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
1,Defective,"The monitor did not work for more than 1 week.First the picture died out and then in a couple of days it stopped working altogether.I'm not sure if it was just our bad luck, or this sort of malfunction happens frequently."
3,Loved it!....until 1 year mark,"Loved this monitor. It was a gift, so cost wasn't an issue. It worked great for a year, but then the ""night vision"" feature failed, so now can't see anything when it's dark in the baby's room (which is the only time we want to use it - while he's sleeping). If room is well lit, camera still works. And the audio still works, so we basically just use it as an audio monitor now. But pretty disappointing, and it's suspect that it would fail right after the 1 year warrently expires. Curious to know if anyone else has experiences this problem?"
2,Always goes down hill,"I will start off by saying that the only reason why this product got any stars from me is because they have phenomenal customer service. Unfortunately great customer service still can't make up for the fact that after 6 months of this monitor working amazingly it suddenly takes a turn for the worse and stays there. I have two camera's because I have two babies. The video only works for my son's room when plugged in (channel B). The audio always seems to die, it goes from crystal clear to pure static. Either the audio is too loud with static, or it doesn't work at all. I have to keep a back up audio monitor in both babies room. It's not my house either because we just moved and the same thing happened. I can't live without the video part because both my babies are loud sleepers so I need to see if they are up or just making noise. I am no longer under warranty so I can't bother customer service anymore."
5,"The best ""Forbidden Broadway"" CD ever!!!!","GREAT CD! WORTH EVERY PENNY!This has to be the best of all of the ""Forbidden Broadway"" CD's availble!!!From the beginging, the parody of Natan Lane in ""A Funny Thing Happned on the Way to the Forum"" to the ""Rent"" sequence at the end, this recording will leave you laughing for hours!The cast is excellent! Bryan Batt's Mandy Patinkin is hilarius! Donna Enligh does a great impression of Juile Andrews. Tom Plotkin's parody of Nathan Lane is awesome! And I cant begin to descride how funny Christine Pedi's Liza Minnelli is.This CD is great and don't delay... But it NOW!"
5,Exceptional Comedy...,"This is a great compilation of creative, hilarious parodies. I have seen Forbidden Broadway in person, and the recording echos the humor of the stage play. This compilation relies on great lyrical work, and the interpretation of the singers/actors. This is a must-have for all lovers of classical and modern musical theater who have a sense of humor (yes there are some of us...)"
1,Unkept promise......................................................,"They lied about delivery, I missed a party and bought another college shirt at a store! I paid expedited freight and they dropprd the baby and killed it. I will never , ever buy anything from you again. I told all my friends the story! I later regifted the shirt. They are full of bullcrap. THEY WERE LATE. I DID NOT NEED IT WHEN IT CAME> JUST a waste of$30.They wanted to chrge me a restocking fee because they were late! Nice world we live in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,The binding falls apart.,"I cannot complain about the text itself, which is proving extremely useful.Unfortunately, after using the book for about five days, the binding has completely disintegrated. I am forced to keep the paradigms I've already studied in a binder clip; as soon as I turn a page, it breaks off.Excellent review text ruined by poor materials quality."
1,Misdescribed.,"I was looking for a first year greek book. Insteadd I got a snootful of declensions and conjugations. I expected some reading from Xenophon's ""Anabasis."""
4,Make plain rice a treat,This company makes a few versions of the seasoning. They are all great. Really spruces up plain rice for making chirashi.
3,The New Purchase/ Sailing Ships?,"One wonders why this edition has a sailing ships illustration for the cover. ""The New Purchase"" is Baynard Hall's story of a journey from Philadelphia in l824 to Owen and Monroe counties and life in southwestern Indiana in its pioneer period. Not the least is his career as the first professor at Indiana University. Seems obvious that the publisher of this edition hadn't read the contents of the book.It appears several publishers are at work churning out editions of the book both in its l843 original form (reprint) and another edition of Dr. James A. Woodburn's editing of it in l9l6, Indiana's centennial year. ~~Dixie Kline Richardson, author of BAYNARD RUSH HALL:HIS STORY"
1,Falling apart!,"Batteries are temperamental, the paint coating is flecking off, and the strap fell off after very little use.2 Thumbs down!"
4,so far so good,"I am presently reading this book, and if nothing else...it's worth it to know that some of the emotions he describes are the exact ones I feel at times. (Nice to know I am not the only one!)I am only about half of the way through it, but can honestly say that I can already see that it was a good buy."
3,In the zone...,"Pretty good book, with some good points. But honestly, it could have been written in an essay rather than a book."
3,Quite hard to follow,"Douglas's writing is unstructured and repetitive. It was quite torturous to read the same points a few times over. The book can be cut down to half of what it is currently. For a better read, try Breet Steenbarger's Enhancing Trader Performance."
3,Think twice before giving 5 stars,"This book is a philosophical book distantly associated with trading stocks. Ideas such as ""Developing a winning attitude is the key to your success"" ""getting rid of fear and euphoria"" have been better explained in self-help books. The author brought out the ""probabilities of market"" but failed to give you risk management and winning systems as in A. Elder's book. The book is worth reading provided that you know there are better 5 star books on trading."
5,Worth reading,Every trader should read this book. Focuses on the psychology of trading which is too often ignored and more important than the actual technical trading
4,The Mental Side of Trading,"Trading is an emotional activity, this book addresses the mental side. It discusses in detail how one should approach the market. I have highlighted many parts of the book for later reference. A great addition to the books that deal with the technical aspects."
4,Nice Read,This book was very interesting! Learnt a lot from it. The psychological aspect was spot on! Most traders have so much to deal with emotionally that this book really reveals all the challenges that we truly have to overcome in order to be a great trader.
5,The Best!,"Read both his books, buy his home-study seminar, do all the homework. I am now back in the black and back on track, thanks to Douglas. I suggest to any trader with even the slightest drawdown to at least buy this book. I waited until I'd lost a significant portion of my retirement before reading his second book -- and found that I needn't have lost a dime if I hadn't been so stubborn. I have now made all my money back and more and am secure in my trading abilities once again. Get the book!"
2,"Starts Strong Then Quickly Fades, Not Good Overall Value","Douglas' book would be much better if it were about 75 pages in length, waaay too much unnecessary filler. This is one-half of a good book, if Douglas had included some trading history or trading strategies for the other half of the book, things would be great. Too bad this book in current form needlessly strings out examples of psychology most people were exposed to in college. At $10, it would be an okay value, too bad we must pay a lot more than that (bookstores don't stock it). Try GeorgeFontanills' options books or Sy Harding's book for winning stock market strategies."
3,the zone,"i first got this book in 2003, and didnt like it as much as i do now after reading it again in 2008. i think the best, and main point i took from this book is that ANYTHING can happen. i now reccomend this book, and would give it more stars if i could figure out how."
2,Terribly Overrated,"This book is basically 50% motivational-speak, 50% psychobabble and very little specifically about trading itself. As one of the other reviews state, the author is very repetitive and has a knack of explaining a one sentence idea in about one full page. The entire book could be easily cut in half without losing any useful content.Strictly from a marketing point of view, the author and publishers could have made a lot more money by promoting this as a general self-help book.Novice investors and traders will find 'Reminiscences of a Stock Operator' by Edwin Lefevre as a far superior book to spend money and time on."
5,For anyone seeking to become a serious trader,"In Trading In The Zone: Master The Market With Confidence, Discipline And A Winning Attitude, Mark Douglas (president of Trading Behavior Dynamics) draws upon his many years of experience and expertise to teach his readers about how to successfully buy and sell stocks at a profit, short-term and long-term, bear or bull market, through overcoming deep-rooted mental habits antithetical toward the vagaries of stock speculation. For anyone seeking to become a serious trader, Douglas' Trading In The Zone will prove to be an invaluable, highly recommended introduction enabling them to see beyond random outcomes and achieve a comfortable acceptance of the ""uncertainty principle"" that governs the stock market despite exhaustive analysis and investment stratagems."
2,I could only struggle though about half of it. I have better things to read.,"I could only struggle though about half of ""Trading in the Zone"". Its got 250 reviews and over 4 stars. But, I didn't care for it. It's very repetitive and provides unnecessary analogies throughout. It's the only book of the last dozen or so that I have read that I didn't complete despite the fact that it only has 240 pages. A yawner. Instead the 2nd half of ""What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars"" has about the same information but is more concise; the first part of ""What I Learned..."" is fairly entertaining as the author chronicles the events in his life that set him up for the big fall."
3,satisfactory,"The book points the trader to very important things in trading; however, I hate the way he writes his book. He could summarize the whole book in 50% of the pages and reduce the time spent in reading. He keeps repeating and repeating and repeating (expanding the topics for no point). Does the author think that repeating will force the reader to understand better? Can't he know that the reader can read the book once and twice and so forth?I would say that the book worth reading since it has very important points and sides that the trader should know before he starts trading. The book will at the end enable the trader to change the way he trades and his vision toward the markets. I expect every one to have better attitude toward the markets, which will enable him to trade with less stress, more confidence and with discipline. (but he will take time to read this book)"
2,Not much of helpful information,Bought the book after reading all other good reviews but was dissapointed. This books has too much repitation of same example which was a bit annoying. Chapter 11 excercise wasn't helpful. After reading the book I walked away with nothing helpful to improve my trading. Very dissapointed.Read:The Psychology of Trading: Tools and Techniques for Minding the Markets
3,It's OK but,"I read almost half of this book and I had to give it up. The reason I quit is because Mr. Douglas just blathers on through every chapter. Each chapter I've read is poorly arranged. He is not a professional psychologist. Plus his book contains no bibliography, no end notes, nor any suggested reading. I can't tell what kind of research (if any) went into this book.At the begining of the book, he mentions that he became a consultant 2 years after failing miserably at trading. I would rather read a book by somebody that failed at trading, figured out what they did wrong, traded successfully, and then decided to become a consultant.Read Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. It has all the lessons contained in Trading in the Zone (as far as I can tell) without any of the pain of Mr. Douglas's blathering."
4,Extraordinarily helpful - just needs a good editor!,"I've read quite a few books on trading, and I've been trading for about 16 years. This would probably be one of the top three books I'd recommend to anyone. I am hoping it will have a huge positive impact on my trading success. As another reviewed mentioned, there's quite a bit of redundancy. a good editor could have trimmed 20% of the book away and made it a smoother read. In any case, I think this book is absolutely worth the time and money."
1,self-help type,"This is very bad. Another treatise on psychology in self-help you-can-do-it style. You probably want this book because you have no trading system and hence no confidence. In this case spend your time developing one. Either you have a system and psychology is irrelevant, or you don't in which case you shouldn't be trading."
2,only for loser traders,"First the cover looks amazing. The reviews makes it sound amazing.. I read it and completely dissapointed. The author spends way too much time describing how our brain works......and that is okay but he applies it mainly to fear of trading. As for me, I don't have any fear in trading and wanted to learn more about the psychology of trading, holding on to positions, etc.....but its mainly on the initial act for traders who don't have any balls....To traders that have balls and have been trading successfully, stay away."
5,So simple yet so difficult,"Trading is undoubtedly very simple in it's methods, you buy at a low price and sell at a high price for a profit; yet it is so difficult to implement the methods successfully. It can be confirmed by anyone who plays the securities by markets that perhaps the biggest problem that brings out the difficulty in trading is oneself.This book does a great job in detailing the mental or internal personal conflicts that may hinder one's chances of succeeding in the markets."
2,full of sounds and words,"but like the tale by shakespeare's idiot, signifying nothing. that a trader needs discipline, a fully developed tool set, and self awareness are trivialities. get a book on trading psychology that WILL help you: the psychology of trading.sorry, but i'm getting really tired of books that promise all and deliver little, are expensive, and parade insignificance behind promising titles.tlt"
2,Trading in the zone by Mark Douglas,"Very hard to understand , alot of jumbo mumbo but get very little information. Wasting alot of time"
4,Trading in the zone,"Very in depth , not an easy read, requires paying attention, doing homework, exercises are given, and I found myself reviewing more than I expected. Excellent content."
4,A unique perspective on the psychology of trading,"Have you learned to tell the difference between playful and dangerous dogs? Then you can learn to trade consistently. This book is an effective how-to manual for examining your own emotional responses to trading, from fear to euphoria.While, yes, the author has a disjointed writing style that becomes distracting at times, Trading in the Zone presents a sound and interesting psychological framework for overcoming the emotional limitations to consistent trading. It is certain that once you've read the book and followed the author's suggestions, you will see your own trading in a new light.Santa's at the door. How will you respond?"
2,Trading in the Twilight Zone,I read thru this book.I followed all the authors advice.It Did Not Help at all.Just think positive thoughts and Save your money on this one.
4,Meet your psychologist,"This book provides psychological training for trading, just like when u're taking part in competitive sports. Players are brought through some psyche sessions to stregnthen levels of determination and perseverance. This book provides training in a layman language which i find very useful"
1,Nothing but a pump up your spirits book,"If I want a Tony Robbins speach I will by Tony's tapes. This book tries to give you the idea that a good attitude will make you a good trader. Bull, you need to have a book that gives you info on how to trade tips not Rah Rah.Buy Electronic Trading Masters by Baird for your best insight."
5,The best,"The best book I have read on trading psychology. Simple and understandable more than Steenbarger's ""Enhancing trader's performance"". More to the point from where you can start trading... in the zone :)"
5,thought provoking,This book is wonderful for experienced or novice traders and it applies to other parts of life as well. Shows us how to be consistent and calm and remain unaffected by internal or external forces so that we can see and respond to opportunities.
5,"A MUST at every traders desk, novice or professional!","Easy to read, follow, and using regardless of what kind of trade or level of experience! Forex, Stocks, Futures, Options etc. this book is something I would read over and over and over.. and then over and over AND OVER again!! I can't imagine anyone being a successful trader without using the information in this book! It's like the traders Bible! Read it, love it, use it, it will help anyone at any level of experience in the business of trading. Highly recommended! :D"
2,WAY TO LONG!!!!,"The idea behind this book is excellent, and I agree with just about everything Douglas says. Although what could have been said in 20 pages took him approximately 200. My advise on this book is simple. If you're an established trader, trading for a year or more and are feeling comfortable with placing trades and are relatively profitable DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! Any issues that you may have whether you know it or not will most likely take care of themselves over time. However if your not comfortable placing trades, are stressed, nervous, scared, or feel there is something holding you back, etc. then this book may help."
4,Impressive,"A well written guide to changing the way you think when trading, assisting in creating an unemotional viewpoint. I keep some of these pointers up on my wall."
4,"Very good psychology, helped me a lot","Kind of boring to read and I'm still not done with it but it really helps you understand and feel more at ease about the market. I needed this, otherwise I would be biting my nails every day, this shows you how to think in terms of probability so you don't have to worry about individual days. The market will do what the market will do, just stick to your strategy."
5,He got it right!,Pros: This is one of the most important books that I've read on trading. If you disagree with the author's concepts you are unlikely to become a successful trader.Cons: All the great ideas of this books could be effectively expressed in 50-60 pages; the author's writing style is tangential and over-inclusive.
5,Excellent read,"This book was able to put the concerns traders face on the psychological level in a clear and understandable way without talking down to the reader. These concerns are things I face in every facet of my life, so once I became aware of them for purposes of trading, I have seen that I am better able to understand why I do and react certain ways in other things. I like the clear strategy to start to deal with the fears of trading. Mr. Douglas does state ""its harder than it sounds in the book"" but I read it thinking ""oh no problem""... but the execution of applying the strategy has been a challenge. Its worth the time I took to read it."
5,Great Camera Bag!!,This camera bag has plenty of room for camera & accessories. It also has a great Velcro divider which can be moved around to create smaller or larger sections; very handy feature! This camera bag is wonderful & a great value in price!!
1,No.1 Hip Hop Hits,"This album is a complete bust. The songs on this album are not sung by the original artists who made the hits a classic. I gave the album 1 star for the price, but after listening to the album I give the album no stars. A true disappointment. The album in no way shape or form tells the listener that the songs on the album are being performed by frauds. The titles are correct and the artists name next to the song title are correct, but once you play the tracks, you are in for a very disappointing surprise. Buyer beware, take your $6.00 and apply to a album that has the orginal artists singing their hits. GOOD LUCK!"
1,Dangerous - Way too big to use as wrist weights.,"The problem with these weights is that as you pull the strap through the fitting to close them on your wrist there is no way to get them snug so that they don't flop around at the end of your arm while you exercise. I am a fairly big guy and even with thick terry cloth wrist bands under them I couldn't get them to fit. After one 40 minute run with these on, I had strained my right elbow somehow so that it was sore for two weeks. If these were 3 inches shorter, they'd be fine. As it is, they are badly designed and may injure you as they did me."
5,Good service,"The stylus pack arrived really quickly. Unfortunately, I had ordered the wrong thing, as my son has the regular DS. This stylus is definitely only made for the DS Lite, so I had to do a return, which was not a problem. Although I got the wrong product by my own fault, the service was excellent!"
3,Hutch - lacks quality.,I ordered this item based on viewing a neighbor's hutch - it had the same brand name and was of good quality. Things have changed - the quality was just not there - little blocks that were glued on along the back edge to support the floor of the hutch - had come off. The glue seemed to have dried out and come loose. If a person had the time and is a bit handy these issues can be over come - but with two eager children and two guinea pigs needing a home there just was not time for me to properly make the alterations needed in the time allowed - I managed to drill and screw those blocks on - but there were other issues that I just live with. If I could have paid more and got better - I would have been more satisfied.
2,Do not waste your money!,"We just bought this hutch, and it is really cheap. Several of the boards are split, and some of the pieces don't fit together properly. It was also missing some hardware. It would be well worth it to pay a little extra and get a good quality hutch. The only positive is that once put together, it does make a hutch that will hold rabbits, but that's about it."
2,disappointing rabbit hutch,The rabbit hutch took longer then it should have to arrive. The quality of the product was not worth the amount of money spent on it. I have already put my rabbit in a different hutch after a month's use. Very disappointed.
1,Poor quality,The glue isn't holding- the hutch is falling apart after less than a week of use. Very disappointed with the quality of this product.
2,Promete pero no cumple,"Cuando uno vee este Trovatore en una tienda y mira el cast, francamente muy bueno a primera vista, lo compra y espera una gran version, al menos en lo vocal de esta obra verdiana...Al verlo llegan las decepciones una tras otra. Primero con una puesta en escena oscura, poco atractiva y aburrida, que cansa ya en el primer acto. Luego vienen las decepciones vocales: comenzando por la chillada Leonora de EVA MARTON, aqui francamente mal, continunado por un SHERRILL MILLNES que ya no puede con el papel de Conde de Luna, siguiendo con una DOLORA ZAJICK que se mueve solo en una discreta suficiencia, muy lejos de lo que se podria esperar de ella y terminando por un equipo de secundarios de lo mas discreto. Por si fuera poco, la direccion de JAMES LEVINE no aporta nada a la partitura, y solo LUCIANO PAVAROTTI como Manrico rinde realmente a la altura debida para este espectaculo.En resumen, no se lo compren."
3,Cuts and Traspostions and Leonora bad; Milnes good.,"I agree with one of the other reviewers that the choice of Eva Marton for Leonora wasn't the best. You notice right away in her first cabaletta, which is pretty bad. The first act trio, though, rocks the hiz-ouse. Sherill Milnes demonstrates much vocal bad-assery. ""Il balen"" is great. Pavarotti is okay too. Warning, though: This performance has cuts and transpostions. The cabalettas don't have repeats, and Di quella pira is transposed down a half step. So if you're looking for the high C, look elsewhere."
5,GREAT STORY,"IF Y0U LIKE GYMNASTICS, YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE. A GIRL GETS IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW AND IS GIVEN A CHOICE OF 6 MONTHS IN JAIL OR BECOME A GYMNASTIC"
5,Super funny,"If you are concerned about the plot, the acting, or how realistic this movie is then you probably shouldn't watch it. However, it's hysterical, even to guys. It is not a movie for young kids."
4,Entertaining,Very witty movie about gymnastics and all of the preparation involved in olympic trials. Great story line and fun characters. I really enjoyed it.
4,Stick It purchase,"The CD came very quickly, within just a few days, and was in very good shape. I've been wanting this movie for a while, but have been unwilling to pay over $15 for it, which is what it goes for at the stores. I was happy to find one for just a few dollars.Gotta love Amazon and those that sell there.Thank you!"
4,A Nifty Movie - A Surprise,From the Bring It On Crew I should have known this one would better than it appears . It was. Very current plot and fun time watching the movie but nothing that require paying total attention its just fun to watch. Not Bring it On but in the same sort of type movie. Always a happy ending ! Interesting theme picking on Judges of gymnastics.
3,I would give it 3 1/2 stars,"I thought it was an ok movie there were some pros and con...For me I thought it took some time getting into, i thought it was lacking some comedy it had a few but would have liked to see more and almost seem simple, i understand its the same people that did bring it on,i like bring it on more not that i'm comparing cheerleading and gymnastic if you will but its still passable I've seen worst teen movies....I like the enter of the movie with the skate boarding and BMX scene, love the Gymnastics, and i really enjoy watching Haley's 2 friends and a few more things about itI mean its between the borderline of ok/good but not great if your looking for a not too serious, light comdey, teen movie then go see it if yor not that type of person who critiques movies down to the T then have fun watching it"
2,Not That Bad,"There are a few great scenes with the gymnastic part, but I could never understand why these ""girl sports"" movies had to be made in the first place. If you ask me, it's quite typical and overtop. What's been done in Bring It On is pretty much done again on Stick It. All the characters are pretty much the preppy, bitchy sorority girl who all of a sudden wants to prove something by doing gymnastics. The one liners are the same, the ""rebellion"" part gets old pretty quick. They try to be funny, but it's just not. If a movie like this is your thing, go for it. But I dunno, a movie of this kind can only go so far. Must we watch an over 2 hour movie that preaches about girl power, believing in yourself, and how you're a winner no matter if you win or lose? Esp. since it never seems to have a new story line to make that point?"
2,Rent,"I don't think this movie knew what it wanted to be. It started out with a troubled teen. It ended up a commentary about judging gymnastics. I wasn't at all impressed with the over the top visuals. I would have much rather seen straight footage of real gymnastics. And the ending didn't make much sense. How do the girls decide who wins the events and who walks home with nothing? Anyway, it was an ok rental."
5,Stick It,I really like this movie. The dvd is in good shape and is exactly what I expected. The girls are really sassy and funny. Jeff Bridges does a real good job as their coach.
5,Suprisingly pleased,"I ordered this movie for my teenaged daughter, and expected it to be as anoying as most of the other movies for teens that are out there. However it turned out to be entertaining and interesting, and my daughter still loved it. I would recomend it to any parent who wants something clean interesting and entertaining for their teen to watch."
5,A MUST see!,"Young girls need to see this one. good movie with great meaning. Missy Peregrym is awesome. Up and coming star, I think. My daughter watched it a dozen times, knows the words, copied the dress, and LOVES it! Got the CD, poster and soundtrack for Christmas."
5,Outstanding Movie,"It is a great upbeat movie. Its not just for gymnastics fans, it will appeal to a wide audience of people."
5,XMAS GIFT,"MY NIECE ABSOUTELY LOVES THIS MOVIE, SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO GET IT FOR HER XMAS. WELL IT WAS A SUCCESS, SHE LOVES IT AND HASNT STOPPED WATCHING IT SINCE."
3,"Great, but they really need to change the box cover.","This seemingly formula teen sports competition dramedy sticks very close to the playbook for the most part, despite some above average writing in the main character's voice over. But the last third really flips the script on this predictable formula, going for a surprisingly REAL bad attitude instead of the ersatz one you're expecting. Surprisingly recommendable."
2,blah,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could add it to the collection he plans to take on his cruise around the world."
4,Gymnastic Theme,It was a wonderful movie for my 6 yr old who is taking gymnastics. She said it was inspirational and made her want to continue her gymnastics practices.
2,movie,the dvd cam in like new but the case was just all black did not have the cover that was horrible
4,"Exhuberant, Re-Watchable, Feel-Good","This is an energetic movie that will brighten your mood. No big surprises, no high art, but well done and entertaining. And it has good politics. Fun to watch and rewatch."
5,Aweasome,I went to go see this moive with my best friend who is also my ex from high school. He wanted to go see some movie but we had no clue what was playing and Stick was the only thing that was playing around the time we were at the theather and even then it had already started 15 mins before we got there. I had never heard of the movie and I do not know if he knew what it was but I do not think so. I enjoyed the movie very much. I used to be a gymnist and it made me want to take it up again. I can't tell if he liked to movie but I know he did not hate the movie. I can't wait to get this on dvd.
1,"BORING, A SNOOZER",Nothing happened in this movie. Missy looks great in the movie. But I have had more fun watching paint dry than this Cheese. I gave up watching it after 45 min. I was waiting for something to happen. Just watch Missy in Season 1 of Heroes. She is much better in that.
2,see coments below,"Two of the films: ""Sing You Sinners"" and ""Welcome Stranger"" froze preventing me from viewing then in their entirety. A ripoff."
4,Another W C Fields Gem,"Above all else, this collection of vintage Bing Crosby films from the 1930's brings at last to DVD another W. C. Fields vehicle, ""Mississippi"". Easily the best film of the bunch on this set, it's great to finally have this on home video. Hopefully we'll get the final films not yet on DVD, Million Dollar Legs and Tillie & Gus and If I Had A Million and Mrs. Wiggs on DVD in a final Fields Vol. 3 set."
5,Nunsensical!,"Nunsense indeed is habit-forming, and it indeed is the magic word! I foud myself singing ""I've Got Pizzazz"" for the entire day after I listened to that CD. It's a great musical. I had the pleasure of seeing it on stage before buying the CD, so while I was listening to it, I could almost see the cast in my mind, dancing around and all. Highlights include ""The Sister Prima Ballerina"", ""I've Got Pizzazz"", ""The Classic Queens"", and ""Angeline"". Not that I don't love all of the songs, but those are the first four to come to mind. ""Angeline"" is very dramatic to a sense . . . the entire CD is wonderful. My favorite nun, however, I must say is Sister Robert-Anne... she's the funniest one. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to bring a bit of nunsense into their life."
3,"Strange toys, strange noise","Interesting sonic experiments from this Texas-based neo-psych/noise band. The contrast between the ethereal feminine vocals--and they're quite beautiful, too--and the sometimes ambient, sometimes industrial, sometimes garagey soundscapes is rather unique. The problem though lies primarily in the coherence of sound from one song to the next, with one track capable of taking you to another dreamy dimension, while another track will only take you to the bathroom for the Tylenol. For those really interested in hearing Mazinga Phaser at their best, try finding the group's debut album ""Cruising in the Neon Glories of the New American Night,"" a brillint fusion of Faust's abstract noise rock, the Cocteau Twins' arty ambient dreamscapes and Can's hypnotic tribal rhythms."
2,Should Have Been An Essay,"This book must have been a struggle to write because it just does not contain enough interesting information to warrant it being book length. Yes, music is transformative and restorative in so many ways. We use songs as anchors to motivate and inspire us. Our musical memories are associative and connect us to so many events inn our lives. And iPods are great little devices that have become pop culture icons. This is probably the reason this book will sell some copies. I think it could have been a powerfully insightful essay, concise and poignant. As a book, it fluff. Boring, dull, poorly written fluff."
5,"Hungry Americans everwhere, look for this item!!!!","LOVE this!!! I am online now because my 4 year old just dumped 1/4 of the bottle onto her rice. It makes everything wonderful- we just fry an egg, throw some rice in the pot, and shake this on the plate after serving the egg and rice. Tasty! If you aren't familiar with the common egg/shrimp/seaweed flavor mix, this will be a nice intro. Its also sweet and salty. No heat. It says ""8"" servings on the side, but I would estimate 10-15 servings, if you don't coat the food too much. Yum!"
4,Wintertime and Summertimme Time,"did anyone notice that Wintertime and Summertime Time on Vol.1 are the exact same melody with harly any lyric changes?...as for the rest of the cd..it is OK but you should proboly pick up ""Tell Me Why"" on the Collectables label instead"
4,Must have for the Beginner,"I found this book originally when I was just starting out on my journey to being pagan. I found it informative especially at the time I was in my teens. It helped me at the time quite a bit, however even back then I thought the book was a bit fluffy. While it is informative to a point, the real meat of the book is only about twenty pages or so. It is still worth getting when all said and done."
2,Not exactly what I expected...,"It began really nice and that is why I purchased the book. But after I finished it, I was somewhat disappointed. Other than the 'tower of light' method, the underlying message I got was: Occultism is not a bad thing. The 'real' occultists are actually good people and do not mess with 'bad' magic.Thus, the title of the book is somewhat misleading... Robert Bruce's book on the same subject is far better than this one and to the point. But I have to say the 'tower of light' technique was a valuable thing out of the whole book (that is, for me--and I am no occultist, but just someone curious about the subject and would like to learn more)."
3,Don't know,"I bought this for a friend in another city so I have no idea as to the condition or content of the book, but dealing with the vendor was hassle free. If Overstock.com can send me a couch for $2.99, why is Amazon's shipping so expensive?!?"
3,"Not bad, but hardly great. . .","This book wasn't bad, but it was kinda dull and a few of the techniques (like her ""Tower of Light"") would be unworkable for anyone but an adept. A good compliment to Fortune Dion's work, but even better would be ""Psychic Self-Defense"" by Robert Bruce, or ""Arcane Lore"" by Scribe 27."
1,What a waste,I feel pretty confident of my ability to put top coat on my nails. But for whatever reason this polish bubbles up on my nails. I was looking for so much more in this product.
3,Missing the shine,"This is a good product that goes on smooth, leaves no bubbles, and dries quickly. However, it doesn't (in my experience) have the same brilliant, glossy shine as the OPI for Sephora top-coats."
5,OPI all the way,"OPI nail lacquers are excellent. This is my first time trying the top coat, but since I am a fan of this great product already, I know it will not let me down.I prefer OPI, and some Sally H over most other brands is because of the durability,& intense pigments in whatever color you choose; from lightest to the darkest; you are guaranteed to get a solid color with 2 coats; and with the lighter shades, sometimes one coat.Tired of having to touch up chips on your nails every other day, try OPItop coat. First after polishing with a solid color; then 2 thin coats of top coat; then one more coat next day."
3,you get what you pay for,"This product worked really well at first, but after a couple of weeks the polish got more gooey and it didn't dry as well"
2,Leaves a nice shine..,"...but takes about 20-30 min to dry..compared with sally's fast dri that dries in within 30 seconds, just not worth it to me..but it does leave a nice shine.."
2,No go,I'm a hairstylist and my hands are constantly in water so I bought this top coat thinking it would last but it doesn't. If I paint my nails at night the next day they are already starting to chip. I heard that the sally hansen top coat was really good so I might just try that.
3,lame,"Danny Tenaglia... not impressed. There are a couple dope tracks... dubtribe, catch that boat, stop fooling around; however, there are some ""raver"" tracks... NOOOOOOOO! You'd think someone who has access to sooo much music would spin some dope beatz but that is not the case. Check: Patife, Bukem, Royal Drums, Hernan Cattaneo, DFuse - People, Sasha - Airdrawndagger, Rafa Navarro, DJ Garth, H:Foundation. Peace!"
5,My favorite work by Miss Etxebarria,"I have read other works by Luc√≠a Etxebarria but I think to date, this is my favorite. While nothing really ""happens"" in the novel, it's a story of a young woman and her adolescence through her young adult years. I loved the book, and although the ending resolves nothing, I can't help but wonder if that's how real life is for most all of us. The one thing I can say is that there is an interesing conversation in this novel about alternative sexualities, the performance of gender, experimentation of drugs, and what it means to be a woman in contemporary Spain today. Etxebarria parodies Dante's Beatrice with her catchy title and character, Beatriz, that is seemingly nothing and simultaneously very much like Dante's Beatrice.All is all, an enjoyable read and not difficult to get through. Spanish is my second language so there were colloquialisms from Spain and particularly Madrid that I'm not familiar with, but other than that it was an easy read. Enjoy!"
3,Nice for Palmcorders,"This bag is a good size for my Panasonic Palmcorder. Holds the camera, a few tapes, the instruction booklet, and a spare battery. Just not enough room to really fit the charger. Overall, though, it met my expectations and I feel it was worth it."
2,An ordinary quality bag with enough space for all your photo & video equipments,"This bag has enough space for still, video camera, a small compact tripod, power charging cords and all other cords, mini DVs. However the outer look and quality of the bag is same as any other bag which you can buy under $10. Bieng samsonite brand I had expected to have outstanding look and outer finish. However it is just an ordinary quality bag which you can pick up in wall mart for lot less price."
4,They are great!,I needed a bag for my Olympus E-300 with the lens kit. And this bag does its job quite good....they are protective and it's got few pockets around which are quite useful. I just wish if the height was lil more. With this bag I can only have both the wideangle & telephoto lens if the wideangle is fitted on to the camera(not the telephoto lens).
1,BEWARE!!!!!!!!!,"This jar of mustard is listed at being 8 ounces, yet the jar I recieved was only4 ounces? I am returning it to Amazon tomorrow they sent me a return authorization."
1,Disappointing,"There are some nice photos in this collection, however most of the black & white graphics are unusable. I recognize a lot of images from Dover books that I have except one thing: some of the images are sliced into different parts and they don't line up! It's really annoying to be doing a flyer & not having some good quality clip art to make it interesting. By the way - are Van Gogh paintings really copyright free? There are some in here!"
1,Amazon is not on-point once again!,Yo AMAZON -What's the deal?!?!?!?!?!All the sample soundbytes are completely wrong...they do not correlate with the titles you've listed here.I do love all these jams -- I grew-up w/ them back in Cali.But it's irresponsible and very misleading to market the WRONG product!!!Don't buy this without contacting the Z-Shop seller personally. Seriously!!!
2,Too small,This keyboard is intended for fast data entry in the PDA. Unfortunately the keys are too small and the keyboard tends to fold when you try to use the middle keys.Not compatible with T3.
4,nigel's groovy,"yeah, this is a great mix cd.., it does come closer to capturing his live sound closer than most other mix albums. april foolz 2 ....how horrid it was so ridiculously hot in there. and the bathroom situation was unspeakable....but i remember someone throwing on the pink panther theme song, and i'm pretty sure it was nigel..."
4,a spanish swashbuckler,"For lovers of the Three Musketeers, here is a modern Spanish version, the first of a series. The historical detail is wonderful, the characters compelling and it did remind me of one of those 19th century romances I loved so much as a teenager.Why not five stars? A certain dryness and lack of excitement at the conclusion. It got a bit musty and historical and the swashbuckling lost some of its thrills. But still, good enough to want to read more of this series when time permits and the opportunity arises.For more on my latest bookThe Nazi Hunter: A Noveland me go to www.alanelsner.com."
2,Story lost among the detail,"I wanted to like this book, I really did! But I didn't. The pacing was all wrong, with what turned out to be a very thin story almost lost amongst all the extraneous detail. Every time something happened there was a flashback, a flashforward, a lapse into poetry, a lecture on history, a reflection on the nature of women, and a lament for what Spain has become. There's scene-setting, and then there's too much information, and this book definitely has the latter. The odd shifts between first-person narration and third-person storytelling did not help, either.Hopefully the next books in this series have more likeable characters and more exciting action with better pacing."
5,The Golden Age,"Spain's Golden Age, the 17th century was the time of Lope de Vega, Diego Velazquez and the world's first global empire. Perez-Reverte's strong prose and poetic sense serves us well in giving us a glimpse of this world and the culture of one of histories great epochs told from the perspective of a heroic character told with great believability and poesy.Bravo Sr. Perez"
4,Watch Out Zorro!,"IF the only sword-wheelding superhero you know is Zorro, then let me introdcue you to Captain Alatriste. Set in the Spanish 17th centruy, Captian Alatriste is a war hero turned sword-for-hire. When a routine ""assignment"" goes bad, the story gets good. Unlike Zorro, Alatriste is unmasked and those who hide in the shadows are kings, princes, and churchmen."
2,Much Ado About Not Much,"Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste. The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste. It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell. But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with. Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader."
2,A Pumped-Up Novel,"This novel could have been a long short story or a novella. One event takes place in the story and Perez-Reverte milks it for all he can. There are plenty of historical persons such as poets, playwrights, and painters thrown it. This is basically a one episode tale. I rate this a B-."
2,Something Wrong Happened Here,"I wanted to like this book. I really tried to like it. Perhaps it was the translation. Whatever, I found many of the sentences needlessly wordy or downright clunky in construction. This awkwardness just got in the way. Then add the story itself. Nothing wrong with the basic plot, but it took too long to unfold, focussing on unneeded dialogue. The choice of narrator, though interesting, presented problems. I mean, how could this teenage boy possibly know some of the things that occurred to Alatriste? Overall, I don't think this book lives up to all the hype the critics have given it. It'll probably fade from memory fast enough. Meanwhile, I will continue to prowl the bookstore aisles for a return to swashbucklers that can entertain."
1,Pointless,"I like swashbuckling, and honor, and political intrigue, and all of that stuff. Sadly, this book lacks all of these.Alatriste is inconsistent -- a mercenary one moment, a hero the next. None of the political intrigue gels into anything interesting -- things happen, and we don't care why.The novel felt like the backstory for some larger work. There was a novelette worth of material in a short novel's worth of pages."
1,big disappointment,"this author wrote The Queen of the South, which was so engrossing, i ran out and bought 3 others that he wrote, and they turned out to be very dull - as if they weren't even written by the same author - did you ever have that experience? Do read Queen of the South for a great escape/mystery/adventure that uncovers the inner machinations of an unusual mexican woman, and forget Captain Alatriste"
1,BORING!,"What a disappointment after Club Dumas and The Flanders Panel!!! It is like reading the mixture of the screen script of Zoro, a history textbook, and a bunch of idiotic poems."
5,Bravo ... a Spanish equivalent to England's Hornblower!,"Welcome to Spain of the 1600s ... the Inquisition, the Conquistadors, the Hundred Years War, the art, poetry, drama, culture and science ... washed down with an adequate dose of swashbuckling and not too much sour wine. Perez-Reverte is a masterful conveyor of the tempo and temper of the times. The adventures of Captain Alatriste and his witness, Inigo, awaken the senses to one of history's most misunderstood periods. Perez-Reverte's Alatriste brings 17th Century Spain to life in the manner that E.M. Forester's Hornblower engages us in the Napoleonic Wars. This series is terrific."
2,Terribly Boring Translation,"The first 30 pages are very interesting. That next 200 were a chore to read.I believe that the translation to English is the real problem with this novel. Though true to the spanish language I feel that the energy and vibrancy of the writing was lost in the specificity of meaning.Avoid this version. Learn spanish and read the original, or wait for a better translation."
3,"Great story, poor audio reader","I have been listening to the audiobook. I really want to enjoy this story. It is the first I have read of Perez-Reverte, I like the subject matter, and I like the story so far. But it is just so difficult to listen to Scott Brick's grating voice. I have had to take breaks from the story because I just couldn't bring myself to listen to him. Had I known he was the reader (I didn't check), I may have gone for the hardback, as I had already experienced Brick's voice in Jon Fasman's ""The Geographer's Library.""One star for audio performance, 4 stars for the story. Who knows, if I had chosen the hardback, maybe 5 stars."
2,big perez-reverte fan,"i've read all the perez-reverte novels, but unfortunately i read the club dumas first and the others just haven't compared at all to it. this one is boring and i actually stopped 3/4ths in to start another novel as i was just too bored with this one. every successive perez-reverte novel released into english translation have all been successively worse than the club dumas.avoid"
2,"Promising concept, somewhat empty","The writing is clever. The characters are emblematic. The quest it introduces is fundamental. Where does it go wrong? Too much wordplay and character interaction unrelated to the story, and a story that wanders and makes no firm conclusion; it's too simple and too directionless. The character ""Captain Alatriste"" would be excellent fodder for future serials, but the complexity contained in this book (outside of wordplay, author asides, etc) is that of a dime comic book and no more. Lengthy poetic excerpts, scene-setting conversations, and rambling motion between places fail to enhance tension or tell a good story. As far as conceptualization goes, it's an A+, but as a read, the book is more like a C- or D."
3,"Swords, Church, Drink","This book was just returned to me. I read it quite some time ago and while it wasn't particularly memorable I enjoyed reading this romantic story of 17th century Spain and one Captain Alatriste, a great swordsman who fears nothing. It wasn't particularly memorable because it was shallow. Regardless, many of the moody scenes Arturo Perez-Reverte creates are authentic in feel and therefore worth reading. I'll certainly try the next in the series when I'm in the mood for a good sword fight."
5,Dumas does Spain,"The ambiance of seventeenth century Spain is brought to life. This was my introduction to Arturo Perez. I was very impressed. It is a sword and street fighting masterpiece that will keep your interest. The descriptions of old Spain virtually paint a picture. The plot is not complex, somewhat predictable and thoroughly enjoyable. Once you read this work, you will be eager to read Arturo Perez's other works even though they modern fictions.Stephen Estopinal, Author of El Tigre de Nueva Orleans (The Tiger of New Orleans)."
5,Phenomenal!,"I haven't enjoyed a book so much since finishing Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series. Adventure meets historical fiction. The tone is one of unsentimental nostalgia, with beautiful lyrically-detailed language. The translator deserves a medal."
3,Someone Needs to Read More Sabatini,"Captain Alatriste shows great promise as a swashbuckler. All the elements are there: the skillful, enigmatic Captian, first seen coming out of debtor's prison; the callow sidekick, eager for love and adventure in the Captian's service; corrupt officials with conflicting political agendas; even a mysterious femme fatale, although in this book she's still only a child. But, whether it's the fault of the author or the translator, I felt we got a bit too much of the colorful Madrid scenery, a tad too much musing on the corruption and decline of a superpower, and not nearly enough swashbuckling.There is very little dash in Captain Alatriste. It's more a cautious foray into the dark streets of Madrid, sword at the ready, and no move made without due consideration.Go ahead and read Captain Alatriste--I'm planning to check out the subsequent volumes as well--then, for a really good adventure, go back and re-read Captian Blood."
4,Fine reading.,"This is my second book by the author, having read The Club Dumas many years ago. This was very fast, exciting, and humurous tale. Very enjoyable, I'm looking forward to the ongoing trials and tribulations of the captain."
3,Poor Translation,"I read Capitain alatriste because I am a fan of Perez-Reverte's work, I loved the Flanders Panel and EL Club Dumas is a must read again and again. The problem with Capitain Alatriste is that the translator butchered the writing - you could actually feel how much the translator ignored the sense of what was going on in the story in order to give a word for word translation. You can get a real sense of what's missing by the last 40 pages - although heinously written still engages the reader in the plot that Perez-Reverte originally thought out."
2,half baked,"This review pertains to the unabridged audiobook version of Captain Alatriste.I was pretty disappointed with the book itself, and with the audio performance. The story has some exciting moments, but in the long run not that much happens, and what does happens is dragged out far too long. At the conclusion, I felt like someone who has just watched an episode of an hour long drama on television, one that was merely okay, and which I wouldn't be going out of my way to watch the next time it was broadcast.The audio presentation was very melodramatic, nearly to the point of self-parody. It lacked the proper rise and fall of tension and release. Instead, the narrator read nearly every scene, every paragraph, with an overblown sense of import. It was irritating and tiresome, but I did manage to endure it to the very end, so I guess that is worth two stars at least, reserving 1 star typically for something so bad it isn't worth finishing."
5,Crystal clear vocals!,"As some other readers have mentioned, recording ""Splish-splash"" may have been a mistake, but the rest of the album is so great, you'll easily forgive that one poor song. From the opening ""Wet"" to the closing ""Kiss Me In the Rain,"" each of the ballads are performed with the skill and class that we have come to expect from Streisand. And be sure to catch her #1 duet with Donna Summer ""No More Tears,"" as well as her jazzy take on ""Come Rain Or Come Shine."" Not to be missed!"
4,Aquatic Barbra,"Barbra Streisand's 1979 album WET is an album with an aquatic theme, the songs all include references and/or metaphors pertaining to water. It is a fairly consistent album, however the introduction of songs such as ""Splish Splash"", ""I Ain't Gonna Cry Anymore"" or ""No More Tears (Enough is Enough)"" interupt the natural flow of the album. While the latter is a great disco song with Donna Summer, it seems to interupt the flow of the album. The remainder of the songs here are shimmering ballads, and this would be a perfect album if all the songs were ballads. However vocally these songs are spectacular, Barbra is on par with the material. The title track is a soft touching ballad, while ""Kiss Me In The Rain"" is a powerful ballad. The real gem here is the ballad ""After The Rain"", which is as good as they come! Other highlights include ""Niagara"", ""Come Rain Or Shine"", and ""On Rainy Afternoons"". Overall its a worthwhile album to add to your Streisand collection."
3,WATER-LOGGED THEME CAN'T BURY THAT VOICE.,"The water theme of this album was an unfortunate choice; it seems Streisand was at a loss for songs appropriate to her range and simply chose some based on their titles alone. If you doubt that, try and endure repeated listenings of 'Splish-Splash' and 'I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight'. Still the lovely ballads 'Wet', 'After The Rain', 'On Rainy Afternoons' and 'Kiss Me in the Rain' feature some of her most delicate, exquisitely phrased vocals and spotlight the matchless voice at the height of its purity. Worth purchasing, but only after 'Stoney End', 'Superman', and 'Barbra Joan Streisand', her quintessential 1970s recordings."
3,An iffy batch of watery tunes,"I didn't know anybody in 1979 who liked the disco-duet with Donna Summer on ""No More Tears(Enough Is Enough)"", even though a shortened version hit the no.#1 spot in Billboard. The version heard here is a little bit longer and it is strengthened by the added space(it grew on me). Really, no album by anybody should cobble together disco songs like this and ""I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight"" with unbelieveably tender ballads like ""After The Rain"". Yet Streisand took a chance and ""Wet"" works a lot better on CD than did it as a record album(on a CD, you can jump around more smoothly). I did enjoy the title track, it's a cute, winking song, and the cool, breezy ""On Rainy Afternoons"", but ""Kiss Me In The Rain"" is a little bit too Broadway; it's too anxious to be a pop-hit, which it wasn't. Beautiful shots of a wet Barbra enhance the listening enjoyment."
5,excellent interpretations,"for the uninitiated willing to find what is the magic of streisand's voice, this album could be the best introduction; her interpretation of the songs here is simply immaculate, restrained and warm, especially on the six ballads, which are the absolute high points of this album; the standouts are 'come rain or come shine', 'niagara', and the single 'kiss me in the rain' - the latter may not be that great a song, yet it is strangely gripping; of the three fast numbers, 'no more tears' is a fine disco track, with nice rhythm guitar work, and the only here on which streisand occasionally wails like a cat; unlike some other readers, i really like 'splish splash', it's really nicely done and streisand sounds very lively; 'i ain't gonna cry tonight' on the other hand, is too long, an uninteresting song, and has just too much strident guitar work which just doesn't mesh with streisand"
5,An overlooked masterpiece!,"When Barbra was rich enough to build her own studio and sound stage at her place in Malibu, she wrote and produced her own stuff. This album is an incredible must have for every Barbra fan, and even those on the side.She wrote a lot of her on songs during this period, but this theme album on all things wet is superub. I highly recommend it. I was thrilled to find a copy of it anywhere."
3,don't get too wet. you might get cold.,"i expected a lot from this album, but was truely disapointed with the result. As the song ""enough is enough"" this LP is a non-sens, they are no connections between the songs, or worse, into them."
4,The One You Remember,"Some remakes do not live up to the original, even with superior special effects. 1984 is one of them. The original -- this one -- gives the mundane and the horror each their place. Because that's much of what the book is about: that the horrible loss of freedom had become so mundane, nobody attempted to question it. This is the power of propaganda, and of mind control. Beware. Even more so today, beware."
5,"""1984"" (1956 version)",Very good movie that captures the essence of what takes place in a totalitarian state. Pay attention and you will see the fundamentals of a society in check. This movie is for those interested in content not visual effects.
1,Very poor audio and video,"This item was billed as ""Remastered"" so I was expecting much more than what I got. It's almost unwatchable and 100% unlistenable. Now I'm afraid to get any of the Edmund O'Brien 1984 offerings Amazon is listing.There must be a high quality DVD of this somewhere - anyone know if there even exists a good copy? I loved it when I saw it in the late '50s on television.On the plus side, Amazon gave me a full refund without having to send back the DVD which is above and beyond the call of duty. Thanks Amazon!"
4,1984,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
5,HOCKNEY CREATES A JOYFUL SETTING,"A sparkling performance by a very talented group of singers and a first rate conductor. Creating just the right setting to light the spark was the scenery of the fine British-American (by dint of long residence) artist, David Hockney. Get comfortable before the television, press the start button on your remote and let yourself be carried along by the magic of Mozart, the Met cast and David Hockney"
3,Very standard production,"This is a run of the mill Metropolitan Opera production, with few stars and rather boring and unimaginative costumes and sets. The singing does not make up for the lack excitement, especially Tamino was very mediocre. Kathleen Battle sings beautifully but her bizarre facial expressions were very distracting. Luciana Serra was very good as Queen of the Night, but her costume was very old fashioned and little cheap, like Halloween one. Kurt Moll has a great voice for Sarastro, and Papageno's singing was also good, but he was playing it for the laughs too much. This is not a very exciting version of The Magic Flute."
2,The Met misses with this production of the famous Mozart opera,"This is a barely adequate production of the great Mozart Opera.The spare stage settings create little of the ""Singspiel"" magic that this opera requires.Franciso Araiza is uninspiring as Tamino but other members of the cast are generally good - Kathleen Battle is appropriately girlish as Pamina, Kurt Moll provides some gravitas as Sarastro, and Manfred Hemm provides some energy and humour as Papageno.This production never springs to life and after a while one just sits there feeling bored.Sound and picture quality are OK."
3,Battle as Pamina,"For the person that cannot handle Battle, a black woman, as Pamina, I would like to state that opera is fantasy. People do not break out in spontaneous song at the drop of a hat. Therefore, it is easy to allow Battle to play the part of a character that was originally written for someone who is white. I don't think Mozart would object. What is important is her singing. Go back to Nature Shows if you can't deal with it."
1,Robin hood men in tights. Terrible flute,"Having just seen the Colin Davis production, this one does'nt come near it. The singing was terrible by Pappageno, and Tamino was a wet lettuce, as for the Queen of the night no feeling in her singing at all. Kathleen Battle was the only half decent singer. The accoustics were appalling. The costumes robin hood men in tights come to mind it gave us a good laugh. Pappagena what was that a munchkin. Do not buy this it is truly awful"
2,yeah...ummm no.,I expected more recipes and less namedropping. The stories were incredibly boring and I couldn't work out why they were in the book. She needs to give up writing or lack there of.
1,Disappointing,I was expecting some very authentic Italian recipes but instead realized that I'm a much better cook than Victoria Gotti.
1,Absolute Garbage,"This program is absolute trash. For a paid screen saver (I might add they want you to pay an additional fee to buy more fish), its quality is depressing.Static backgrounds, no Anti-Aliasing, no Aniostropic Filtering, no realtime shadows, etc. I expected it to be of game quality, but instead got some flat fish bumping around a static, low-resolution background. The background didn't even look nice.Clearly some people lack the system resources to run this well. I do not.AMD 64x2 4400+ dual coreNforce 4 SLI7800GT2 gigs of RAMIf I didn't get this for free after a rebate, I would be screaming bloody murder."
1,beware,"This program requires a VERY up-to-date system. If your video card doesn't have drivers created in 2005 and your DirectX is less than 9.0..., don't get this. It has lovely images but it just doesn't work right, even with 2004 video drivers. Tried their on-line support but it was frustrating to navigate. Tried email contact for tech support, but haven't heard anything in 7 days."
3,I've seen better. My baby likes it.,"I was a bit disappointed with the fish and the ""tanks."" I have seen better at the computer store. I've got a 6600GT PCI-E video card, and it only looks O.K., not great, awesome, or other.That said, my 4 month old was very happy to stare at the fish and seemed happy that I got this. Worth the time to order and complete the rebate to make it free."
3,Dissapointed,This program was not what I expected.. I got a better aquarium from the internet on a free download. The selection of fish is very poor. Settings were nice and lighting was good.
1,Very bad product,Its verybad product. It system dependent. Don't buy it unless you are having latest system with high video ram etc.
1,Beware... It doesn't work on some systems,I have windows XP SP2. My CD drive doesn't recognize this CD. It says either CD format is different or corrupt. I ordered for a replacement and even the replacement CD it is the same problem. I never had problem with any other CD.There is nothing in the Technical support. I returned my CDs.
2,pretty good,"Good socks. , nice material. but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it. They are knee high and stay up, provide good warmth in the cold weather."
1,Not Cotton,"Even though this website appears to indicate these socks are 70% Pima Combed Cotton, the package the socks came within indicates they are 0% cotton. I wanted cotton, knee-high socks and thought that is what I purchased."
2,2.5 Stars,"Ibought these socks for the purported thermal heating qualities. I was still cold. Just a regular average socks, easy to wash and dry so great for travelling, nothing more."
5,These are great socks. wash great. stay up. soft & comfy,"I've been wasting my money on stuff in the store. I only rarely find knee-highs and when I do they fall apart, they are scratchy, too thick or too thin. these are wonderful. perfect."
1,poor elastic top,"The top elastic portion of this knee sock is of poor quality - my pair did not survive a full day of wearing and as a consequence, I had to keep pulling the knee sock back up toward my knee. I would not recommnd this product."
5,Best Knee Socks Ever,These are the most comfortable and best quality knee socks ever. I love them. I recommend them to anyone looking for good quality knee socks that are not too short or too long. They are just right. Even after washing they are still so soft and look like new. I am so happy that I found them on Amazon.com. The color does not fade either. I will order every color they have so I can match every outfit I have.
4,Very comfortable sock.,"I have been looking for socks that don't bind into my legs, especially when wearing boots. These socks are very comfortable and don't leave binding marks on my legs, even when wearing boots. I just wish they weren't so expensive. $7 for a pair plus tax, shipping and handling, is a bit expensive."
2,Hue knee socks poor quality,I agree with another reviewer that the quality of Hue socks is very poor. I get holes in the heels and toes very easily and the band at the top of the socks did not last a day. I was constantly pulling the socks back up as they would slip down my leg. Does anyone know of a decent quality knee sock?
2,Holy Moly,"Love these knee socks, smooth and comfortable, but whoa. After just 2 days of wear with 2 pairs, holes in the toes!"
2,"Comfy, but don't stay up",I was really looking for a sock that would stay up and these don't. They are soft and comfortable and around my ankles. That ultimately makes them a waste of money.
1,False advertising,"This product (navy blue knee socks) advertised to be over 60% cotton, which is why I bought them. They are only 33% cotton. Secondly, the navy knee socks don't stay up. I was too lazy to return them, but should have. Am disappointed in Amazon and will be far more cautious in ordering anything in the future. The brand name is Hue and their products are becoming more and more synthetic, which is why I do not buy their socks in the stores. I was taken in by the false >60% cotton description. No more of their socks for me!"
5,good looks and warmth,"I ordered several pair in Charcoal and they are simple in style, not itchy and warm without excessive bulk."
3,Disappointed,"The tweed color socks were much better than the solid color--better fit. I was looking for a knee sock that was long enough (I'm only 5'4"") and one that would hug my leg and not slide down. That wasn't the case with the solid color socks but the tweed color was fine."
5,Love these socks!,These are great socks! They work great with boots and with heels! They were a Christmas present from my husband. He got great points on this one!
2,Unfortunate,I would not recommend this if you really want toknow to how to make Sushi unless you are looking for aSushi cook's uniform.
5,Easy and Informative,"This video was easy to follow, and told me exactly what I needed to make sushi at home. It even gave some simple tricks and substitutions so I wouldn't have to spend alot on preperation utensils. It also shows a great example of how to set up a small ""make it yourself"" sushi party buffet."
3,Poor battery life...,"I purchased this trimmer in November 2008. It initially worked great, cut smoothly, and held a charge for at least 1-2 shaves. After roughly 1 month of use, however, the battery would not hold a charge. I called Wahl customer service and had a replacement unit shipped to me. After roughly 9 months of use (only using the trimmer 1-2 times per week) the battery again would not hold a charge. I still am able to use it for about 5 minutes after charging overnight (enough for a VERY quick shave), but needless to say I'm not very pleased with this product overall."
4,A Satisfying Product,"I bought it about 1 yr back and is still working fine for me. The comments were a lot help for me to take the decision on buying the Wahl. But I do not regret the choice I've made and its worth the money I've spent. But since this is my first of this kind (a goatee), I think the sound it provides is a bit high and as I've read in couple of other comments the removal of attachments are a bit difficult thing to do."
4,Good product,"Good product. I use it on my whole beard with no guard for that 5 o'clock shaddow look. Had it for a month and the motor is already feeling like it's losing power, but it is recommended that you drain the battery completely once a month and fully re-charge and I haven't done that. I would re-buy."
2,Ok overall...but...,"It's an OK product but when using the stubble attachment it snags and pulls on the beard. I have exchanged the item twice and the same result. Too bad, I really like the length of the stubble guide attachment."
3,Barely gets the job done,"I have had similar Wahl shaver products in the past and this seems the weakest of the bunch. At first I thought the battery was not charged all the way when I first turned it on, but it had all the charge it was going to get! Not great, but it gets the job done. Nice depth/length adjustment, though. Smaller blade on other side that swivels around, but is basically useless. I have actually paid less for other Wahl trimmers and had more speed/power and a light! Not great!"
5,Wahl Goatee...A must Have!!!,"This product is the best thing ... it east to use , very consistent and makes grooming a breeze. AWESOME !!!"
1,Looks good But!,This Item is very appealing to the eye but that is about it. It cuts but clean up takes several passes to meet this neat freaks cut he likes. Blade is just not sharp enough
1,Terrible terrible terrible,"This is THE WORST TRIMMER i have ever purchased. Normally, Wahl makes amazing grooming products, but you really get what you pay for here. The snap-on guards do not fit well and they break very easily. They break so easily that i wasn't able to get it working even once. I am very mechanically savvy, so it isn't a case of giving a monkey a Rubic's cube, it's just a terrible and cheap piece of machinery"
2,Not a beard or mustache trimmer.,All I can say is that I am completely dissatisfied with this product. It is very cheaply made and a very poor trimmer. It may be fine if you like a short goatee but anything more and its just not going to cut it. Even after going over my short beard again and again it kept missing hairs over and over. It just does not lift and cut all the hairs evenly.As for the base its about as cheap as they come and wont hold the trimmer very securely and I also had a hard time getting the power cord to stay attached to the trimmer. It is very loose and wants to fall out with the slightest touch. I would but this in a $15 trimmer category and for goatees only. I gave it a two since I think it would work fine for very hair but anything over I would give it a 1 star.
1,don't be fooled by the wahl name here,"I decided to try out something different from the Philips Norelco, and decided to go with another good name brand, Wahl, or so I thought. This thing should be pulled from amazon. The attachments are crap. Thin cheap plastic, hard to put on and take off. I had to pry it against the counter top to get it to come off. The multi height attachment is poorly designed. With a curved head design depending on what angle you hold it at, it will cut different lengths! Despite all this, the trimmer it self pulls at your hair. I couldn't get through one trimming of my goatee with out it painfully pulling my hair over five times in two minutes. I sent it back. I got the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, this thing works wonders!!! Just want I wanted from a trimmer."
2,"Fake cradle, design flaw","Wanted to finally replace my old Conair and heard good things about Wahl. I was disappointed that the cradle didn't actually charge the battery, you have to manually plug into the adapter cord (how tough is it to have a charging cradle like my cell phone, Sonicare, and even my ancient Conair trimmer??) Also missed the nose hair trimmer that I had on the Conair- but the final straw was that the small attachments were VERY difficult to put on and off. Otherwise, the blades seemed nice and sharp. Perhaps another Wahl model...?"
2,"Not a good ""Five O'clock Shadow"" trimmer","If you are looking for a trimmer to give you a good ""shadow"" look, this is not a good selection. I purchased this product, noting the good reviews and having respect for Wahl products. However, the attachments that come with this product for a close shave do not work well, and whisker after whisker get pinched between the plastic attachment and the razor. It's very painful. This product may work well for a full beard, but it doesn't work well for the close trim."
1,Really annoying and defective.,"So I need to get a beard trimmer as I decided to grow a beard. Keeping it trim was the best look, both profesionally and personally. I go to Target, pick out what looks like to be a solid buy. I charge it overnight. I try to use it the next day nothing happens. I charge it for another night, making sure I am doing it exactly right. Nothing at all the next morning. of course I can't find my receipt, but will probably mail back the package to Wahl and try to get a new one as it says it has a 5 year warranty. In the meantime, I will have to go buy another beard trimmer as I want to keep my facial hair and not wait the 3-4 weeks to get my new one in the mail. By the way, it's cheaper at Target where i bought it."
4,Very nice glasses for the price,"I bought these and the larger ones also. They are nice and sturdy, and look great. The one drawback is that when they break, they shatter into a billion tiny shards. One immediately broke because the packaging had come loose in shipment. Then I ordered another set (because I needed more than six) and that set came rolling around in the bottom of the box, but unbroken."
4,Good book,"A GIRL NAMED DISASTER is a pretty good book. I would certainly recommend it to fellow young adults. The story about an oprhaned young girl in Mozambique is really interesting. Her lifestyle is almost Stone Age, but she lives in a modern world like the rest of us. The author was pretty good about the accuracy of the tribes and lifestyle in southern Africa, and she wrote a pretty entertaining story."
3,A Good Book,"A Girl Named Disaster was a book filled with adventure. Nhamo, a young, strong, brave girl living in Mozambique,forced to marry a cruel man sets off on a journey of adventure and life. Through her journey, she tries to survive the rivers, animals, and spirits. I think that the book was pretty good. I loved the stories she told and the way she told them. She tells the stories to get through the pain she goes through. If you like adventures read A Girl Named Disaster."
4,"daring,and a cliff hanger","I liked this book because it was really good, and interesting, see I know theese (most of them)languages because I was born in south africa and lived there for most of my life."
4,a great book,"this is a great book tellimg the story of a girl in trouble and introducing a new and different culture. this story of adventure,survival,and finding a place to fit in, will show you a new way of lookimg at the world"
4,A Girl Named Disaster,"A Girl Named Disaster is a fantastic and exciting novel that takes place in Mozambique and Zimbabwe. We enjoyed this book because it's adventurous, has a lot of action going on and has different cultural beliefs. Nhamo, the main character spends a lot of time doing her chores. When she is finished with her chores she goes and talks to her grandmother or the picture of what she thinks is her mother. The Mavuki the witch smeller) tells her that she has to marry and old diseased guy with three wives. If she doesn't, her village will be cursed. Nhamo runs away to find her long lost father in Zimbabwe. She goes in a boat and floats down the river. If you are looking for a long interesting book, read A Girl Named Disaster.By a group of fifth and sixth graders"
4,A Girl Named Disaster,"A Girl Named Disaster proved to be a very good adventure novel. It's about a girl named Nhamo, which means disaster, who is forced to run from her village in Mozambique. The focus is on her journey to Zimbabwe and the things she learns along the way. At one point she lives with baboons for several months. It was believable that she wanted to die, but decided to continue on when spirits told her to. I highly recommend this book for anyone that would like to learn about African culture and hear a great story."
1,Boring from the start!,"I bought this book when I read the back of it. I was so eager to read this book, but it really started out TERRIBLE! It dragged on forever! The stupidest thing about this book was the glossary of African words. I really don't feel like looking in the back of a novel to find out what ""durdur"" means in English. I loaned this book to the library, figuring that they would need it more than I did. I would NEVER recommend this stupid thing to ANYONE!!!"
1,Depressing book,"This book is extremely depressing. Everthing that happens to this girl seems to be bad. You keep hoping that it will get better, that things will turn out well for her in the end, but in the end, nobody loves Nhamo and every one who every cared for her is dead. I felt really let down when I finished this book."
2,Oh gross...,"I read this book as a requirement for an English class last year, and I thought (along with a great majority of my class) that this book was sick and totally dumb. Mrs. Farmer added some totally unnessesary... ehem... ""mature"" elements here and there to spoil an otherwise OK book. The plot was interesting, but there is way too many details and people in the storyline that the basic story is lost in the confusion. The other reviewers may love this book... but really, it's not good at all. Take my advice: Keep your credit card in your wallet and your money in your piggy bank... unless you favor disappointing books."
2,ok but not my favorite,in the begining this was an ok book. but then it just got really boring. i was forced to read this book in class and im telling u know everyone who read it comlained. please dont waste your mone on this book.
2,Not my favorite book,"Not my favorite book. This was not one of my favorite books because I am not a big fan of girl against nature stories. Nhamo spent so much time traveling and going around the island when she could have spent that time with her grandmother. Once she was on her own, everything was about her survival and her struggles for food and shelter, against the animals, and finding her way. To me, it would have been a much more interesting story if we got to see her struggles against her cruel husband, his other wives and her mean aunt. I would have liked to see her stay and care for her grandmother and spend time with her while she was near the end of her life. Her struggles and the struggels of her parents and family were so sad even though she survived and came out on top. However, there is a lot of suspense, danger, action and a girl's fight for independence, survival and her family. If this appeals to you, then you will probably love the book. It just wasn't my type, though."
3,Confusing,"My daughter didn't like this book due to some ""scary"" events in it. She's 10.There are leeches and other ""really gross"" parts - according to her.It is set in African culture - which needs to be explained to the average child - which isn't bad just confusing.It would be a better read for someone older than 10 I think."
1,This book is a disaster!,"I was forced to read this book in English class and it is terrible! If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night, this is the one. I dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining!"
3,A Girl Named Disaster,"Well, the book was quite good. It had a lotta African words which made the book not as good as it should of been. (...) I could of book down because it the wasn't good and it was like BORING!!!"
5,"Wonderful, exciting book!!!!!","This is one of the best books I've ever read! Nancy Farmer is an excellent author and I want to read more of her books. She made Nhamo, a girl who gets lost in the wilderness seem real. It's great!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A really great book,"A Girl Named Disaster is a really great book. It tells of a girl's journey, not only through Africa, but through life as well. It tells of life in a village in Mozambique, how some animals lived, and a little bit of life in Zimbabwe. I loved the stories that were told and the facts and words I learned while reading this book. The details really helped me to picture the events going on and the plot was interesting. Maybe at times it got a little bit too detailed, but I still like the book. If you like adventure stories and learning about history and beliefs of other cultures, then this is a terrific book for you to read."
5,great book,"A Girl Named Disaster was a very good book. In fact it is a Newberry Award Winner. It lets you travel to Africa without leaving home. The book is about a secret murder and a forced marriage, causing a young girl to flee to Zimbabwe. What should have been a short trip turns into a long journey with many challenges. By using the spirits of her elders the young girl finds her way. I liked this book because of the facts brought into the story through writing. Also I became very attached to the characters and beliefs. This is an awesome book and I recommend it for people of all ages!"
4,good book!,Very good--- I've read a lot of Gilbert Morris books and this one wasn't so predictable. It had some depth and leaves you with a nice ending that makes you want to read the next one. After reading several other christian novelists i'd have to say Morris is the best.
3,Sweet depression era family in non-stop crisis,Nice story with engaging characters. Sometimes though I wanted more of a pause in the crises.
2,Seeing black particles in filtered water,"After 2 weeks of using this product, I saw black particles in filtered water. The light on filter is still flashing green though."
4,Water Filter,"Works like there suppose to, delivery was quick and easy. I have been using the Pur Filter for some time and it is very convenient."
2,This leaks after awhile,"As another reviewer pointed out, this seems to ""spring"" a leak quite often and it then sprays all over your sink. I would go with another water filtration system all together next time. Do not like the leaks on this."
1,did not fit my Pur faucet filter system,"This was advertised to fit any Pur faucet system, but it was incorrect. I contacted the Pur tech department, which gave me the correct number (RF 9999)."
3,Adds more sand to water,"The filter itself does its job by removing contaminants(I guess)BUTEvery time I open the faucet I see hundreds of noticeable carbon particles inside the cup which are added by the filter itself.If PUR attached a very simple micro-net at the end of the filter to avoid this from happening I wouldn't have to return my unit and get a refund.ALL types of PUR replacement filters have this problem.Even if I let the water flow for 15 seconds,it won't fix the problem."
5,Pur..Is Great!!,"We've used Pur products, for some time, now. We love the good taste of the water. Lasts a few weeks, depending how often you use them."
4,"""Pur"" Water Filter","The filters were shipped as expected in an orderly fashion. The price, including shipping, is comparable to shelf prices locally. We use one of these per month, and will be re-ordering from Amazon as needed."
4,easy to use and install but pricey,"I bought these online since they were cheaper than at the store, but for the price, they don't seem to last all that long. Easy to install once you have the faucet holder set up."
3,Slow flow but does the job,"It's fine for the price, but the flow of filtered water is very slow. I don't think it's the pressure from my tap because without the filter running the water flows fast. Regardless, the slow flow beats drinking horrible tasting northern Virginia water."
2,Not Longlasting,"The filters lasted 2 weeks. I did not drink 100 gallons of water during that time. The Filter suppose to last 2 or 3 months or 100 gallons, whichever comes first. Not true."
3,Very poor water?,"Not sure if it's the water in my apartment, or the quality of the filters. But my faucet complains it needs to replace the filter after maybe a month of use. Sure, we have 5 people here, but it just seems wrong."
4,Like it,Nice product and easy to install. Little expensive in terms that you have to replace filter every month (Depend on quantity of water it filters)
4,works well,"What can you say it works well, has nice flow rate and filters the water. After relaying on these reviews myself I thought I would contribute."
4,Perfect filter for the country.,We have a well that has some sediment problems. This filter works great and lasts a lot longer than the the three stage filter.
5,Easy to install,The refill was so easy to install and it was ready to use after only 5 minutes. The water quality is excellent
4,a must for well owners,"product works great, and removes any bad taste from tap water, including our well water that we have a water filter system on."
5,Can't Complain,"These 2 stages are great. I used to smell metal and chlorine but now NOTHING! I usually buy from Target where they are $14 each, so the price is better here. They also usually have a little of the red indicator already showing, but not these from Amazon. I cant say how many gallons Ive gotten but I would say a couple months pass before I change it. I never feel like, 'Boy I just changed this thing'. I use it for all cooking, tea, washing vegetables and I drink lots of water everyday. Most of the reviews for the 3-stage complain about low water pressure and not lasting very long but I dont have that issue with these 2-stage. As ususal new does not mean better. Even though the 3-stage is cheaper I would suggest investing in the 2-stage as it will pay off in the end."
4,no problems!,"I've used the Stage 3 filter, but decided to save some money on another faucet and switched to the Stage 2 filter. There might be a difference in how clean the water is, but taste wise I can't tell. This item shipped quickly, safely, and works as it should."
5,Excellent value,"This is an excellent value, as a single pack is only a few dollars less in discount retailers such as Target."
3,black particle,I have used it for 2 weeks. It all goes well. But suddenly there's black particle in the water and I don't know why :(
4,Look no further,"I bought these to refill the faucet mount in my offfice.On Amazon you can get this version rather than the more expensive Mineral Clear which is all I see in the big box stores.Works fine for me, water tastes great."
4,water filters are keepers,"initially, i didn't think the filters were working as the use indicator didn't seem to function. I talked with PUR and they said give the filters more time to see if they're good. They are and i am completely satisfied with my purchase from you. I've purchased many things from your firm and this is the most trouble i've ever had and thanks for following up.Again, all is well with my filters and water!"
4,Awesome figure. Bad stand,"I was amazed at how detailed the figure appeared including the limbs, head and especially the wings. The figure itself is quite durable and can take quite a bit of abuse.On the other hand, the plastic stand that comes with the toy is kinda cheaply made. The base seems a little too small and light to fully support the figure, so I recommend somehow adding weight to the base so that it can stand in place better. Also, the stand is made of plastic that broke after a few falls, however duct tape has fixed it so it's not much of a problem anymore.Overall this is a great collector's item for any X-men fanatic and/or collector and I highly recommend it for those fanatics."
2,Needs more spice.,"The only saving grace in this book was Grif and his colorful family. There was almost no romance until the second half of the book. Then slight sexual tension when Grif decides he likes Anna after all. There was virtually no sex until the end of the novel.Throw in a family heirloom and a English cousin bound to uncover Grif's secrets and ruin him and you have a shallow, one-demensional novel. This book ran about 100 pages too long.However, the witty dialogue saves this from a 1 star rating."
2,Long dragged out bore,"At first this book really grabbed my attention. I was looking forward to reading it and Grif was, and is still, a great character.Sadly, this book dragged on far too long for me. Highlander in Disguise is 374 pages. I gave up reading around page 300 when Grif and Anna were still NOT together. Over 300 pages of nothing isn't worth another 74. I can take a guess at what happens anyway. They finally get together. Finally. It is not even worth finishing if it is only 74 pages after a 300 page wait. Even if it's page 301 where they finally get together- too late. Don't care. They get together, kiss, blah blah blah. Not worth it anymore. I don't even care if they got the 'bloody beastie' or not.I also felt as if Grif deserved a heroine more mature and less shelfish than Anna. She got on my nerves quite a bit.If you like a book to ruin your expectations and make you go from wonderment to disappointment, then be my guest and read this one."
5,Very Pleased,The ornaments looked awesome! My son-in-law is a huge Vikings fan. He was very excited to receive this gift.
3,A good .,Great application to real life. Well written and east to read. Our pastor used it in a serom series and it was great to read the book as a follow up to a good message.
4,Great Product,"Came in great timing and this book is great!! Great book, very encouraging and uplifting!! Condition is perfect, I was a bit hesitant getting the paperback book because of the damage that it could have been through, being a bit ruffled up, but the condition was perfect:>"
2,"Good Concept, But Poorly Written","""The Christian Atheist: Believing in God but Living as if He Doesn't Exist"" by Craig Groeschel was disappointing. While I appreciate the author's attempt, he should not quit his day job.What I mean by that is although he made some good points about how a Christian can be living as an atheist, this book did nothing for me.The book has a tone more catered to a younger audience (High school or college students).Also, the paragraph structure is disorganized and jumps from one topic to another.I would not reccommend this book to my friends."
5,Still Making Me Think,"I had the opportunity to read an early copy of this book and it really challenged me. In the course of normal life, I'd find myself thinking about certain chapters and questioning why I do what I do and if it really reflects what I believe. And the chapter on worry? Yep.Highly recommended!"
5,Amazing life changing experience...,"While reading this book, it has opened my eyes and heart of what is the true meaning of Christianity and our relationship with God. It made me more aware how we should portray and live our Christianity, according to God's way. Definitely a good book to read."
5,A read as intriguing as the title!,"Do your actions back up your words? This basic premise in the ""the Christian atheist"" challenges each reader to take an honest look at their own walk with Christ to see if they truly are who they say they are. This book is to the point but Craig Groeschel does a great job of letting his humor and down to earth personality shine through for a read that will shake you to your very core."
5,Great Book,Great read.My hats off to this author.It is very insightful.This author is very transparent.It makes you focus on what changes you need to make in your faith.
4,Good read,This book was recommended to me by a friend. It really challenges you to look at your life and to see how you can live it better for God.
5,Life Changing,"This book is excellent. It really challenges believers to check our hearts and see if we are truly living a life worthy of being called a follower of Christ. It is also great in challenging us to move out of our comfort zones. Some of use call ourselves Christians, but still party with the world - how is that Christian? Some of us call ourselves Christian but constantly worry or put our faith in money rather than God - how is that Christian? This is a great book to really push us to a higher level in our Christian walk. I believe every believer should read this book and that it truly will benefit them."
5,Slap in the Face,"This book is amazing! My small group is doing the study that goes along with this book, and it has been truly eye opening. I thought I was a good Christain, but realize now that I am a Christian Athiest. When you believe in God but aren't sure he loves you was a hard chapter to get though for me. As I go through each day now, I am mindful of my actions and remember that God's love for me is so much more than I can imagine. I would not want my children to die for sinners, but that is just what He did for me, even though I at times act like Ge does not exhist."
5,ENLIGHTENING!!!!,Craig's book helped me to look deeper into myself as a Christian and made me realize just how much closer I can be with my Lord and Savior! He put so many things into a new perspective for me! He truely has a God given gift to keep people interested while all the while bringing them closer to God. His comedic abilities keep this book light enough to keep you wanting to read more and more! I was actually sad when the book ended. I could've read more and more! I can't wait to be enlightened by his next book!
4,The challenge to truly follow,"This is, more than anything a challenging book. The author challenges us who call ourselves Christ followers to in fact, follow him by acting like He's the Lord of our lives, instead of acting as if He doesn't exist.The chapter on our past is one of the best, where Groeschel reminds us that it's not our sins that define us. Chapter 9 has a great section on the difference between being happy and being blessed.Perhaps the best chapter though is the one on worry. ""If God does what you think He should do, trust Him. If God doesn't do what you think He should do, trust Him."" Good advice.Highly recommended for all Christians and seekers to read."
3,Great concept... excellent message... decent read,"I agree with the concept. I see it. In part, I live it. I want to learn and I want to grow. Rarely has a set-up been more...er, set up to challenge and convict, to encourage and cause maturity. Add to that, I really wanted to like this book. Frankly however, I find myself doing a lot of the work here... which isn't all bad. Maybe I expect too much.Probably the greatest flaw of the book is the many specific stories it tells of others in their ""Christian atheism"". It's a weak spot because with the details come differences - and my details are unique, and the subtlety of my ""Christian atheism"" makes it easier for me to say, ""Well, at least I'm not as bad as that guy."" The microscopic view Groeschel takes may get in the way of individuals being able to see the big-picture.I had to edit and soften my comments because I like the book the more I think about it."
1,Out of place,"Finch, Alkaline Trio, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Midtown, The Used. What are good punk bands like these doing with Blink and NFG? Well, I think blink was trying to put together real punk bands to make fans of punk become more turned on to radio-friendly pop packaged as punk thereby giving them a couple million bucks to go buy Hurleys clothing for their MCA loving poser selves. Besides, it's not one Alk3's shining stars on here, Midtown could do better, same for The Used. Finch is about the only band that shows what they've got on here. This album annoys me and so does Atticus trying to make people think that punk rock is a trendy style. Go take the 5 bucks you were going to spend on this and go get ""All Hallows Eve"" EP by AFI. I swear it's about 50 times better than this crap. In closing, I would recomend this album to a teeny-bopper rather than a fan of actual punk fan. later."

5,Rocks! Of course!,"And you certainly can't beat the price! As for the one previous reviewer claimimng the cd is great except for Blink: This compilation (and in my opinion, many of these bands) would not exist if not for Blink! Atticus is their company, and the guys are trying to get some well deserved exposure for these other bands. Oh, and track 18, by Simple Plan,features Mark Hoppus, founder of the dreaded Blink. Rock on!"
5,AWESOME!,"only 7$ for this awesome cd?!? Excellent deal, has 24 great songs on it with bands such as Box Car Racer, The Used, Blink 182, Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Jimmy Eat World."
4,Great Punk Rock,"This album is good - yeah. I had very high expectations for this album and it met them, I was just hoping for a little bit more. I won't lie to you though - It is a great deal. You won't find very many cds that have 24 tracks from great band for just $$$ bucks. If you like punk rock, give this album a try. What do have to lose?"

4,Cats love it!,"It's simply a pillow your cat will loves to death. It's fun, lightweight and keeps your cat going for a very long time. However, one drawback is the sewing isn't as strong as I'd like it to be. My cat was able to sorta rip it open after a few weeks of play."

1,Too Shallow for Mr. Coffee,"These filters claim to be for all 8-12 cup coffee makers, but they are way to shallow for my Mr. Coffee. The coffee rises above the filter and contaminates the coffee pot."
2,Get the latest Edition and skip this one,"Wish I could return this, but I bought it before taking the class and now the 30 days is up - spend the extra $$ and get the latest edition - this one doesn't help w/the CLEP test. It gives an overview of the material, but if you actually want to learn about Western Civilization, this won't be enough information and you probably won't test well. The newer edition w/the CD is better for taking the test."
2,Tintin in America,"I am a big fan of the Tintin series. But in my mind, this is one of the worst. The drawing is not as good as some of the other books, and the storyline isn't as good. I found that in this book, Tintin narrowly escapes death and gets out of tough situations a few times too many."
2,Probably Tintin's weakest book,"Tintin's third album, originally published in 1931, is probable the weakest in the series. The young reporter goes to an America that looks like the standard Amerika of the European left: set in Chicago and the American West, the country is a commercialized hell populated by gangsters (whose leader is Al Capone himself, the only time a real person appeared in the whole series), greedy capitalists, uncultured rednecks and exploited redskins. As in the early albums, Tintin seems to escape from sure death at almost every page. Still, for those who accuse early Tintin books of being extremely right wing, it's interesting to see in page 29 how the expropriation of Indian lands for the exploration of oil is denounced. Also, in page 41 there is a very amusing satire of proto - radical environmentalism, as an old lady that is a member of an animal protection organization protests a mountain lion attacking a deer."
1,Disappointment in America,"While not all Tintin books are ""great"" - this one is at the bottom of the pile. The plot is non-existent and the violence was pointless."
3,Weak early work.,"Herge, Tintin in America (Methuen, 1932)The first of the canonical Tintin works (the third written; the other two, out of print for decades, are finally being brought back into print in 2007), Tintin in America has served since the forties as an introduction to Tintin and Snowy for generations of fans. It's an odd little volume, not as smooth nor as funny as the later works got, and it still contains some pretty nasty stereotypes (the reason those first two adventures have been out of print for so long) about ethnic minorities as part of the background humor. If you're a Tintin completist, obviously, you'll need a copy of this one, if you've never read it; otherwise, I'd suggest starting with one of the later adventures and coming back to this one once you're already a fan. ***"
2,Terrible Copy of the Book,"The problems with this version of this great Tintin story are numerous. For one, this copy is in black and white, and while that isn't that bad in itself, compared to other, color, editions, the black and white looks flat. The binding on this book feels very, very flimsy and I'm not sure the book would last many readings. The contents, the end papers, and the covers all feel like they were printed on low quality paper, so this book feels rather cheap.Positive aspects of this edition is that it is quite large, so it's suitable for readers who need larger words and pictures. Further, the book is extremely affordable for a such large version of this book.There are, however, much better editions available, so skip this one."
3,Chicago-1931,"1931 , and gangsters rule the streets of Chicago. It is up to intrepid European journalist Tintin and his dog Snowy to tackle Al Capone , Mr Smiles and other gangsters, taking him from Chicago to the Wild West where he dodges Indians and Cowboys , and back again.But not the best Tintin.Too full of stereotypes about the USA , and lacks the intricacy and vibe of The Cigars Of The Pharaoh , King Ottokars Sceptre or Destination Moon."
4,"You're ""Out to LUNCH"" if you don't own this CD!","Lunch is a truely magnificent soundtrack. It's packed with great songs. Laurie Beechman does a killer ""I Never Danced with You,"" Melissa Manchester makes a poignant statement with ""Why Fall at All,"" and Carol Burnett steals the spotlight with ""Perfectly Alone."" I would love to see this musical on stage... Any musical theatre buff is seriously remiss for not having this in their soundtrack collection."
4,A Great Compilation from Dance Music Authority,"DMA: Freestyle Flava is an excellent compilation of greatfreestyle music. DJ Felony knows how to keep you moving. However, Icannot give this recording 5 stars with a clear concience. Please don't let 4 stars discourage you from purchasing this item. It is definately a ""must have"" to add to your dance collection. Buy it; you won't regret it!"
2,false advertising,"The dynamic sushi maker on the front of this video is masking its home-video quality and general non-professionalism. This could be made by anyone with a camcorder, the footage of actual sushi restauarants is brief and has been given a strange effect, and they are blurry on their direction--some of this info is for the idiot (often American names for food that a knowledgeable chef would not likely use) and other info assumes way too much from a beginner. Make your own video, pretend your mildly interested in the subject matter and sell it yourself. It obviously can be done."
3,"Weinmann, 27x1-1/4, 219, Front, Q/R, Silver, Alloy, Wheel","China made wheel looks good, sort of a matte finish silver with ss spokes, spins true. I always disassemble a new hub and do a little preventative maintenance (make sure there's sufficient lubricant) and didn't see anything wrong. I put it on an 80's Bridgestone Kabuki road bike that I use for training so the price was right."
3,Complex features - complex operation,"This program has lots of valuable picture manipulation feates, approaching even high end photo editing suites. However, everything is hidden behind a non-standard interface, and the hard or soft copy manual is not worth talking about. Of the many picture editing programs that I have explored, this comes closest to incorporating all those features that one needs when trying to do semi-professional work with photos. I found only one minor bug and this is a good value for the money."
4,She looks great and plays quite well,"Mutter is a very accomplished violinist.I had a chance to accompny her in a orchestra... what charisma she has... but that was a Penderecki violin concerto.She plays Beethoven well also, but not quite as well as her Mendelssohn or later works.I think though this DVD is worth getting. Lamber Orkis is a fantastic accompanist."
5,Loved Timmy Deluxe,"I helped my child with Timmy Deluxe at school. 6 countries and languages. We both loved it. Fun, quick, cute, nice music, nice art (not babyish), funny stories. Where can I find it retail?"
5,great sugar bowl,"Tired of spooning sugar out of a bag or canister, I realized I had a need for a small sugar bowl. But I wanted something stylish that would look good on my countertop. This one looks fantastic!"
2,New Beard,"Disappointing. Advertised as being illustrated; it was not. The standerd Beard cookbook is one of my favorites. This is an attempt to add more, but they get kind of weird."
3,An overview,"This 1943 book offers a brief view of the Mexican Revolution. It serves those who want an overview, and it provides guidance for those who want to know where to look for more detailed reading. Half the book is photos, and that collection also is good. For those who already know the subject, look to another book for depth. This book is good for what it is, a readable introduction to the subject."
2,Disappointing,"""The Wind That Swept Mexico"" was disappointing. I had hoped for a balanced view of the Mexican revolutionary period. But instead I found the story written from a largely leftist/Marxist perspective. In particular its treatment of the Cristero revolt was an anti-Catholic parody of the real events.The pictures were excellent; but sadly the narrative fell far short of any serious historical treatment."
2,more about philosophy than science,"I expected a book about ""brain science"" to be, well, scientific. I would categorize Newberg, D'Aquili, and Rause's book as philosophic, or perhaps mystic, but certainly not scientific. While the book contains some description of their method and findings, the description is so vague that the reader is given no understanding of how ""brain science"" can foster such voluminous speculation that pervades this book. That said, I was intrigued by the philosophy and the speculation about the origins of mysticism and its relationship to ritual and religion. And, if I wasn't so disappointed by the books title, I might have given it a slightly better rating."
2,A great introduction into neurotheology and neuropsychiatry.,"The book starts out very well. The author uses logic and clear terms to explain everything. But then he starts making stupid assumptions left and right. Newberg explains mystical experiences and the ""feeling of the presence of God"" and then says that they're just as real as eating an apple pie because they can be examined in the brain. That's like saying that my conversation with God while I'm on coke is just as real as eating an apple pie because you can see the neural processes in my brain. In short he says that because it feels as real as eating an apple pie it IS as real as eating an apple pie.But don't misunderstand me; the book is a great introduction into the field. Just don't base your beliefs on everything this book says."
1,In a word...Boring...,"Unfortunately, this neuroscientist has no penchant for philosophical discourse and so his treatise was bland, pendantic, convoluted, poorly organized and inconsistent in its ideology. There was nothing in here that I couldn't have read in the Newsweek article on the subject (May 7), only at least that article was only 4 pages, succinct...and only cost a few bucks."
4,god in your body,"This is a great book. I studied biology, and i think that this is an understandable presentation for readers at all levels. The coolest part to me was when he wrote about how people experience a sense of oneness during spiritual experiences and which part of the brain is most active at that time. Super rad."
3,A worthwhile read,"Not perfect, but a good read. The authors are on to something here and have done their homework. They present a well thought-out body of theories based on scientific evidence and reason, but while they deeply examine how brain structure and function relate to religious belief and experience, they do not use this as an opportunity to *invalidate* religious belief. Carefully done."
1,BAD science!,"The book deserves to be trashed because it is an example of ""applied"" science, i.e. the authors are Believers and are using science to support their beliefs. We live in a democracy so they have the right to write the book, but I certainly hope their fellow scientists shun them for the misuse of scientific resources (supplies and money). To think my tax dollars may have helped them to twist the purpose of scientific inquiry to prove God exists."
1,"Bland, boring, incomplete...","There's nothing more annoying than those who claim to be scientists but who are open to a religious explanation as to why we might have evolved the way we did. If humans possess a brain, God did not put it there. It evolved. One is either a creationist or an evolutionist. There is no in-between. In order to sell more books, however, this author seems to sit on the fence and refuses to accept a purely scientific explanation to his own research...a real turn off."
1,Ethical Qualms,"While this book contains some intriguing information, I am troubled by the authors' complete indifference to the ethics of subjecting perfectly healthy meditating people to quite possibly harmful radiation."
2,Close to pseudoscience,This book was very disappointing. It attempts to use science to prove the existence of god. It reminds me of the archaic belief of Descartes that the soul intersects the brain at the pinneal gland in the brain. There are some questionable interpretations of SPECT scans but I'm not expert here but I had hoped for more scienctific detail. Where were the controls? This is not science.
4,The author almost made up his mind,"The text reads in a most interesting way, with a relatively coherent stream of information. Then it reaches what one might call its ""natural stopping point"". However, like many mediocre sermons gone awry, the author continues. The unfortunate thing about this particular ""coda"" is that the author seems compelled to make a ""profession of faith"" -- as though everything that had gone before was simply interesting table-talk, while his self-affirmation of ""spirituality"" trumps what might implicitly be relegated to a category of ""if this science contradicts faith, then the science must be rendered subservient"". If the editors at the publishing house thought that this addendum would be required to prevent an anticipated stream of hate-mail, or if they thought that this ambiguity would provide ""buy in"" with a larger purchasing audience, it is unfortunate that the author allowed such recommendations to cast his scientific observations in an unfavorable light."
5,fantastic combo of tivo and dvd,"i love this unit for tv viewing and dvd watching.the remote control is very comfortable to hold in hand and all the buttons are well positioned and clearly/intuitively marked.better than original tivo remote and any dvd remote that i had used before, plus it can be coded to operate my tv, amplifier too.you can put your tivo in sleep mode (recording in background) with just one button (unlike regular tivo, even the latest 2011 premier model, that required multiple buttons press)furthermore, it has tivo basic for lifetime free out of box, although you don't have access to season pass, you can still record programs repeatly by time/channel, just like classic tape recorder."
3,Room for Improvement,"1. Noise of Fan and hard Disk2. Remote does not have following featuresDVD: Open/ Close from RemoteCable: Cannot change volumeCable: Cannot get Program INFO as available on cable box.TIVO info is wrong at times3. Does not change Channel's if IR port is used. It is successfull in changing channel on first attempt in only 40% times.4. TIVO does not allow watching a different channel while it is recording. Its a documented feature in mannual which can be done by keeping TIVO in standby more and watching other channel but doesn't work.Else, great product. Wish there was a DVD recorder alo build in."
1,"unreliable as hell, hindsight would never buy a combo unit","I've had so many problems with this model that it's embarassing. it was incredibly difficult getting it to use a USB adapter (even according to cust. support), and the clock kept on drifting off so that in 2 months time it was so inaccurate you missed half a 30min sitcom recording (needed to repeat hard reset until it ""caught' the right time). once this trick didn't work i returned it for repair, with the refurbished replacement unit not even booting up. i sent that one back too, and just now got a message from toshiba that the unit i sent needs to be replaced as well, and offered me a credit.I'm genuinely embarrassed at the time i've spent on this. the ONLY reason i'm spending time writing this is that i'm on hold...to get my refund."
4,Great Product!,"After getting used to the product and the operations, I think it is great. The only downfall is that there is no clock in / on the display. The install instructions were good. With my setup it took 2 hours."
3,Love It -- Failed in Seven Weeks,"I wanted to get my wife a Tivo unit since her biggest hobbie is watching TV. The Toshiba SD-H400 intrigued me since the basic Tivo service is free and would save on the subscriptin service. So I bought the unit for Mother's Day.I love the unit, and once you get used to it, the Tivo service is really great. However, after a mere seven weeks of use the Live TV function would ""lock up"". After powering off the unit, doing resets, and reformatting the hard drive, the unit would still lock up on a single frame every 2-3 hours of use. Toshiba Customer Service wasn't much help -- just told me to do a reset. I was able to finally get a replacement unit, but it took a lot of effort.Great idea and cool features, but the reliability of the SD-H400 is suspect in my mind."
3,WONT PLAY SONY DVDS,"I HAVE OWNED THIS SINCE 2003 WHEN IT CAME OUT. NO PROBLEMS WHAT SO EVER AND WOULD BUY IT AGAIN. HOWEVER, IT WILL NOT PLAY THE NEWEST RELEASES (2007 AND ON) OF SONY DVD RELEASESAS. IT CANNOT READ THE DISK THROUGH THE NEW ANTI-PIRATE TECHNOLOGY SONY IS USING (I HAVE SPOKE TO TOSHIBA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY ARE NOT MAKING AN UPDATE). BASIC TIVO IS GREAT WITH NO FEE. FACTOR IN BUYING ANOTHER OR KEEPING YOUR CURRENT DVD PLAYER AROUND TO PLAY DVD'S AS THE OTHER COMPANIES ARE PROBUBALLY GOING TO UP THEIR ANTI-PIRATING SOFTWARE SOON TOO."
4,Great Product!,"This is my first TiVo product. It came highly recommended by co-workers and friends. It has greatly improved the viewing of both cable and DVD's. The install didn't go exactly smooth. It seems that you always have to go to Radio Shack to get connectors! The directions for set up were an 8 on a scale of 10. TiVo has been installed for two weeks, and now it is easy to use. Love the recording live tv feature, and the record ahead feature for shows. Over all both my wife and myself highly recommend it!"
4,Opera,The voice of David Daniels is an unbelievable instrument and listening to him can bring tears of incredulity.
2,Really quite dissapointing,"I had heard so much about the amazing voice of David Daniels, and was basically quite surprised when i heard the recording. His voice is neither beautiful, nor very powerful, and unlike that of Andreas Scholl, it lacks projection, and careful control. On top of all this he has a unpleasnt wobbly vibrato. What is all the fuss about, he is so clearly neither as good as any of todays great countertenors - Michael Chance, Andreas Scholl, James Bowman, Robin Blaze or Charles Brett."
4,Good but not great,"It's possible that David Daniels will prove to be something of a mayfly. His voice heard live in 1995 and 1996 was quite extraordinary; effortless, powerful and perfect, quite lacking the countertenorish 'edge' which had always been assumed to be a necessary evil to that voice. In other words, he didn't sound like a countertenor. Unfortunately however his voice, while still excellent, has now become slightly rougher, nowhere near as thrilling. The sad fact is that there were no recordings made to my knowledge before 1997, when this roughening had already started, EXCEPT for the video, available only in the UK and only on UK TV format, of the Glyndebourne production of Theodora in which he sang Didymus so astonishingly beautifully it nearly defies belief. Buy the Handel CD and enjoy it, but don't believe that it really represents an extraordinary countertenor at the height of his powers."
3,Cheaply made,This holster fits too tight for a Taurus model 66. I can barely get the gun into it. It is make with cheap plastic rivoted together. I hope it holds up but don't think it is worth the $$$.
3,Did not fit my revolver but nice holster.,"Fobus makes nice holsters this is no exception. It just did not fit my Taurus Tracker Model 627 in 357 Mag due to the bull barrel on my gun, fit my brothers 357 fine with normal size barrel. Fast shipping."
5,pageturner!,"I found this book so exciting that I had to stay up all night to finish it. Fiction could have not created a more complex set of characters than Debra Holtz's family, both adopted and genetic. The sense of place and time from her childhood Chicago to her adult California is terrific. I was facinated by the tremendous inner resources that Holtz developed to reconcile her personal story. Her writing is wonderful. The book is gripping."
3,S&B Curry Powder,"It's not bad, but not what I'm used to getting from a friend in Singapore. I had to add more cinnammon and fennelto get the taste I enjoy. But it is much better than Indian Curry."
3,"It's OK, I've heard better....","The first CD mixed by Dumonde is pretty good, I love the track selection. The mixing is really good. The second CD has better music, harder trance that gets you going but the mixing is terrible. DJ Nervous was just jumping from one track to the other. He didn't take his time with the mixing, something you can notice on Dumonde's CD. All in all it's an OK CD. A good party CD just to have music on...need to get ""ID&T Hardtrance V.3"" mixed by Marcel Woods and ""X-Qlusive Dana"" mixed by Lady Dana in stock. They are on the ID&T Label. That's good music. Check ID&T Hardtrance V.2 mixed DJ Bas & Ram ASIN: B00007FKR8 It's a really good mix. Take Care."
2,Way overpriced for what it represents,The product I feel is way overpriced for what it represents. It is a good DVD straight to the point with good support Powerpoint presentation but definitely far to expensive.
1,Argentina (and Eva) are crying.,"I bought this CD a very long time ago for the simple purpose of hearing the greatest piece of Theatre in history in Korean. As soon as it arrived I raced home and stuck it in my Cd Player. The Requiem for Evita was very good and extremely eerie. then as I got further into it, I started laughing. This has to be the most horendous piece of music ever. I just love how the orchestra looses it's place a few times and runs over the actors'voices. And the wort part of this CD is that there is ony one track. You cannot skip over the songs. After an hour, it began to feel like the chinese water torture. how embarrasing for the actors playing these tremendous roles. Thank God that Eva, Che and Juan are dead because this terrible farce of an opera would kill them. I just want to know who Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice let this go on? Don't they keep track of how their plays are performed.Ick Ick Ick....Argentina is crying all right...and so am I - for my money back!!"
2,This CD is only good for the laughs.,"I bought this CD because I thought it would be interesting to hear the score of my favorite musical in another language. First of all, apparently digital technology in Korea is way behind. The entire contents of both discs are contained on a single track. So if you want to listen to ""Buenos Aires"", for instance, you have to fast forward all the way to it or just listen to all that precedes it. The music has a bit of an Asian feel to it, which is interesting, but the orchestra is horrible. They obviously recorded the whole thing in one take, because you can hear hideous mistakes, most notably toward the end of the dance interlude of ""Buenos Aires"". The first time I brought the CD home and listened to it, I laughed the whole way through it. On a positive note, most of the singers (with the grave exception of the chorus) were pretty good. However, the translation often didn't fit the meter of the music. An awful lot of money for a few good laug! hs."
3,def. not the best evita,"based on the other reviews i thought this would be really terrible and unlistenable, but it's actually not that bad. it's def. not going to be anyone's favorite version, but as this is pretty much the only korean cast album, if you're interested in korean musicals at all you don't have much choice. along w/ the previously mentioned one-long-track-per-disc issue (which isn't such a big deal if you listen to it on your computer and can skip around), the orchestra and singers and even the instrumental balance aren't at the level of US cast albums. but i wasn't bothered by that so much as the generally slow tempi; a faster overall tempo would've really made this a lot better. anyway, as i said it's not as terrible as the other reviews said."
2,not sticky enough,"I used this tape to paint stripes on my walls. It was the only 1/4"" tape I could find but the adhesive wasn't great and I had to paint over it using a matte medium before the paint just to get most of the stripes. It still leaked in too many spots."
1,Words by heart,"I have read ""Words by Heart"" by Ouida Sebestyen from cover to cover. I can truely say it was not a book i enjoyed reading. The reason is mainly that it goes on and on about every little detail. It also is just another on of thosesa black and white controversy book and its not like we dont have enough of thoses already. Another thing that drives me nuts is when I am reading a book is when you can tell what is going to happen next. In the book you can surely do this. I always knew what was going to happeen. The only part was at the end what pa did. This book over all was not very good. But if you read it you might like it.My whole eight grade reading class had to read ""Words By Heart"" and not a single one that I know of liked it. Maybe that might tell you something but it but if it doesn't you ocan go out and read the book yourself and then state your opion here on amazon.com."
2,Words By Hear,"I don't really like ""Words by Heart"" and the reason why is maybe because I am only in 4th grade and I don't get it, but there are a lot of parts that I did get and this book just isn't for me. I had to read this book for the 4th Grade Advanced Literacy Assignment."
3,My opinion of WOrds By Heart,"I liked the book ""Words By Heart"". I thought the author used good content and great context. The words in the book were easy to read and they also meanty something to some people. The author also madee the words tell a little meaning when she used them. If I had to rate the book ona scale of 1-5 I would rate the book a three. I chose that because I did not like the begining but at the end the story shows you that love means more than anything. If I had to read this book again for school I would read it. It's a good book about responsibilities."
4,A heartwarming story of hatred overcomed by love.,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The strong characters made you have a real sense of what might have gone on in a real situaton similar to the one in the book.
2,Words By Heart,"On a scale from one to five i rated this book a two. It wasn't bad enough to give it a one but it wasn't the best so i couldn't give it a five. The book does a pretty good job on describing things, but i am not interested in the topic. The beginning of the book was some what boring. But in the end it got really exciting. I like the way she used a mixture of characters, their, feelings,actions, and religions. The people in this story were real enough for me to imagine and that is terrific. Frankly this book wasn't all to aweful. I don't really like the fight to be equal because we have already gotten past this point in history and we don't have as many problems with it now as we used to. Now if you think we still have problems and need a look on how to handle it then read this book."
1,NNOOO!!!,"This book was thoroughly horrible. I hated it. It was extremely boring and according to my standards, it wasn't well written. Even all my friends hated it. It was either too sad for them or was just plain stupid. Personally, I recommend you don't get this book but it's really up to you. *sigh*"
2,Review for words By Heart,"As a class for 8th grade reading we read ""Words By Heart"" by Quida Sebestyen. It was a great book in a way because it delt with racism and how some people couldn't deal with a black family being in their all-white community. Even though I thing it was good in that way I also some what believe it was very boring and not very interesting for fids our age. The book also shows how people overcome some things that are happening and make friends with a black family and at the end helping them because they realize that in the beginning they were wrong. They also realized that they should treat them as though they would any other family in the community. That is why I thought it was an ok book."
1,My thoughts of Words By Heart,"I did not like the book at all! I thought it was very boring and I couldn't even really read it without yawing. There is no action or excitment in it what so ever. I don't like how they have a racism in the book. I don't like to read about books that have something to do with racism. The book ""Words By Heart,"" starts out very boring. A girl named Lena is at a spelling Bee and it goes on about that and it becomes even more boring then befor. If this book was to have some action in it then it would be a lot better and maybe more people would like it then what they do now. I would recommand that someone who likes boring books or books that have to do with racism and a little girl growing up and wanting to be noticed then you should read this book. IF not then this is not a book that you would injoy at all."
2,Beware if you are Prejudice do not read!,"It was an okay book for me, but maybe not for other people. It deals racism in a small town. It takes place in 1910. It wasn't very interesting and I am having hard time telling you about it because it isn't good."
3,What I think about Words By Heart,"This book definately wasn't the best book I have ever read. It had a really well-written story line. The author had a way of making the words flow. This book had many conflicts and resolutions to it. The conflicts were well described and well plotted. The author describes how life is for the characters in the book. She describes how there are hardships and good times in the story and in their life. The details she gives on how each character feels in certain situations, is done really well."
3,my opinion on words by heart,"This is a book evaluation on the book ''Words by Heart.'' My opinion on this book may be different than yours but I think this book is boring in some parts of it. It is not a bad book but I didn't really like it because because it is about when white people acted really immature and they treated African American people like they were not equal to them.This is a story about a African American family who has to go through stuggles because some white people were treating them unfairly. This is my personal opinion, but this is not one of my favorite books because I like reading books that have good things happenimg in them."
1,words by heart,I think this book was not very good. It is about a black famliy in hard times. there was not a whole lot of action in the book. all it is about is a kid that reads out off a bible. To me that is so lame. the bible is not lame but I dont like that stuff. If you are looking for a book that has a lot of action in it this is not the book for you. If you like this stuff it is about then read it but i did not like it.
1,Words by Heart,"This is about Words by Heart. I didn't like the book at all. To me in my opinion, I don't think anybody should read this cause you will probably fall asleep when you are reading it. I read about the first two or three pages of the book and was bored out of my mind. If it was stuff in the future where we are now then it probably would have been better. If you want to read this book I wish you luck on not passing out."
2,words by heeart,"THE BOOK ""WORDS BY HEART"" I THOUGHT WAS A OKBUT BORNG BOOK. THIS IS THE 1 BOOK I HAVE READBY OUDIA SABESTYEN BEFOR. WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY AUTHER IN FIRE. I READ ALL MOST THE HOLE BOOK THEN IT GOT REALLY BORING AND I JUST SAT THERE TH EHOLE CLASS AND DID NOTHIING. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE REAL LIVE STUFF THAT HAPPENED. THE BOOK WAS GOOD THOUGH THE FIRST FEW CHAPTERS THAT I READ BUT THEN IT WASNOT SO GOOD."
1,My thought of words my heart,I don't like the book because there is not really any action.Lena has to go to Church and recite scriptures.Nobody thinks she can do it.So what.Who cares?I don't All she foes is try to make her PaPa proud.If she wins She get's a surprise.So what.Then violence and death comes to her family.And she has to forgive the people who did this.I am not judging the skin color or anything.The book needs a little redo.It needs turned up a notch.This book is more for kids.They would like the book better.I rate this book a zero.If I could because it is so stupid.I would not let anyone read this book unless they are boring.
2,My Thoughts About Words By Heart,"My opinion on this book is that I really didn't care for it at all. I didn't care for it because it was a love story that had a bunch of problems and,I have my own so I don't like reading about them. I also don't like getting upset and in the book Lena gets upset. Lena is a girl like me that has a lot of problems in life. That is why I don't care for the book Words By Heart. I would like the book if it was not about a teenage girl that has a bunch of problems. That is my opinion on the book ""Words By Heart."""
1,Words by Heart,"Overall, I would have to say that I didn't like Words by Heart all that much. But, that's only my opinion. Some people that are total opposites of me may like the book. Everyone is their own person. Personally, if you are just like me, then you will be bored to death just as I was. The life in this book is not like anything that would happen in everyday life. I don't think you should read this book because it will bore you until you can't be bored anymore. This is not one of Ouida's better books. I can tell by reading this book. I would suggest you don't read this book and find a different and more interesting book."
2,My review on this Book,I read the book called Words By Heart. This book was written by Ouida Sebersteyn. I read almost all of it and from what i could tell the writer did not use the right context for the setting or for where what time period its in. It needed to have a little bit of an accent because of the year it ataakes time in and out west which those people have . I did not really like tyhe beggining of the book but once you get after the contest and are on about page 30 or so. It starts toi talk about workin and it takes place in the country and on a farm.I would recommend it if you had patients and wuld take time to really read the story so you no what it means. Thats all the information I can give without reining the book for you.
2,Words By Heart,"I didn't like the book because, i thouht that it was dull. It didn't really have a lot of excitment. I like books with action and adventure. I really don't like books without action and adventure. The books I like to read deals with history and sometimes and they are bettter than this book. I would like to read books about the outter space with blood and killing in them. Now thats exciting to read about. I really like sports books and magizanes. I would like to read Blood and Choclate the seqile to Silver Kiss."
4,A must read !!,"Words by Heart is a sad but good story. Lena went to a scripture contest. After the contest, she comes home and finds something disturbing. Lena thinks that this is a warning since her family is the only black family in the neighborhood. Competition and anxiety keep you at the edge of your seat. Nonetheless, tragedy and sadness come to her family."
2,Realistic Portrayal,"I read this book as part of an Education Class requirment this semester. I started reading this book reluctantly and was going to skim through it to get only the information that I needed for the exam. I found myself engulfed, reading everysingle word and not stopping until I had finished the book. It is a very good portrayal of a young sheltered child that learned a terrible reality about prejudice and racism. In the end, this child showed courage and loyalty far behond her age. Her head held high, she did not deviate from her convictions or responsibility."
4,A very good book,"Lena Sill is an eight year old, African American girl. She has a Papa named Ben and a step-mother whom she calls Claudie. Lena also has a five year old brother named Roy, a three year old sister named Armilla, and a baby brother named Brother.Lena's family works for Mrs. Chism. Lena misses a lot of school because of her housekeeping for Mrs. Chism. However, she gets the school work beforehand so she doesn't fall behind.This book is really good, I think, because it is a very touching story. Sebestyen was able to get excitement in the olden day book by having a contest, adventures, and fun. This book is interesting in every way."
2,"1 good track, 22 boring tracks.","This CD may well kick off with a roaring and rocking guitar riff that is Carpenter performing at his absolute best but the rest is dull as ditchwater. There are no themes in any of these tracks. It's actually a lot like the ambient music in the Myst and Riven soundtracks. Only those CDs are cool and the music within is haunting and etheral. If you dig this kind of music then by all means by those instead. ITMOM may well begin with some of the best electric guitar sounds ever, but the CD is not worth buying. A shame really, because Carpenter is a truly gifted musician."
4,Freescha - Whats Come Inside Of You,"Funky, spacey IDM from Freescha on WHAT'S COME INSIDE OF YOU. There's more than a bit of roller-disco to ""Rinky Dink,"" and ""Watcha Gonna Go For It?"" wobbles to its own groove before drifting off into an abstract beatbox. ""Smurf Shoe"" has some electro touches to it, even as the melody switches from major to minor keys, while ""Lover Function"" is content to stay low and level, almost Seefeel-like. ""Come Good,"" on the other hand, has a sly emotional quality to it. There's a slight over-reliance on the same synth pad, which, even though it binds the album together, also homogenizes it somewhat. But still, an release worth enjoying."
3,Sized a little small,"I was a little disapointed with the shoe. I ordered it for my son and got a half size larger then his regular shoe. There was no way that he could get his foot in the shoe. The seller was excellant about returning the shoe, although I did have to call twice to get some help."
5,So Cute!,"This book is so fun. I bought it for myself as just a little something to read when I have downtime and I'm so glad I did! There is tons of information in here! Even if you've been a ""grown up"" for a long time, I bet you'll learn lots! My favorite part was the wine education section. I knew nothing about wine whatsoever but now I actually feel like I know the difference between them. There are also really great recipes and decorating ideas. I'm keeping this book for life!"
4,Not exactly the same as what you saw in the theater,"This is a magnificent performance and an innovative production of Tchaikovsky's beloved Eugene Onegin. It was my favorite ""Met at the Movies"" performance last year, and I was very much looking forward to its release on dvd. That said, there was some editing done, and not for the better, which is why I'm giving it four stars instead of five. Still, I wouldn't want to be without this one in my collection."
4,Eugene Onegin at Metropolitan Opera House Feb.2007,"Tchaikovsky's dramatic score depicting Pushkin's tale of unrequited love is movingly portrayed by Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Onegin and Ren√©e Fleming as Tatiana. With his rich, long-phrased baritone and artful characterisation Hvorostovsky brings to life a very credible Onegin, adapting from his cool response to Tatiana's letter to the empassioned profession of love in Act 3. Fleming's Tatiana dovetails this as a convincing ing√©nue in Act 1 leading to the honour-bound wife of Act 3. Her warm lyrical soprano producing a moving 'letter scene'. The production cleverly presents the action as taking place in Onegin's memory, starting with him alone on stage, during the orchestral introduction, holding Tatiana's letter, All around him are autumn leaves, some falling from between the pages of the letter, suggesting a mood of love lost."
3,Hvorostovsky is NOT Baryshnikov!,"I have this opera film in high definition DVD (not Blu-ray), and enjoyed it very much. However, I could not believe my eyes when I checked out the listing on Amazon.com for the Blu-ray version, and it said Renee Fleming and Mikhail Baryshnikov. Shame on you, Amazon! I love Baryshnikov's ballet videos, but please don't confuse him with Hvorostovsky just because he is Russian! That listing would frighten off many opera fans, who would then miss an interesting interpretation of Onegin, with some marvelous voices."
3,Met production of Eugene Onegin,"Rene Fleming is outstanding as usual. However, I had not seen the production when I bought the Blu-ray -- frankly having seen a previous production many years ago, this one is simply too minimal in character. Onegin is a rich musical experience -- and, if you closed your eyes, the music was magnificent and wonderfully done. The visual aspects, however, did not add to the great music. Buy a CD instead!"
4,Awesome performances - wish it was on Blu-Ray.,I saw this in the theater when it was broadcast live and was blown away by the performances of Renee and Dimitri. The set was minimalist yet wonderful! I was hoping this would come out on DVD. I just wish it would come out on Blu-Ray disc so I can watch it in Hi-Def at home. Watching it on standard DVD just doesn't quite compare to watching it in Hi-Def.
3,This is NOT a Blu-Ray Disc!!!,"I placed my order for this opera from one of Amazon' s merchants, expecting to receive a Blu-ray version.Much to my chagrin I received the standard DVD version. I did not check the album until a few weeks after receiving it - by which time it was too late to return it."
2,Ruined by poor staging,"Great, great performance - singing, acting, conducting - marred and denigrated by an absolutely unforgivable production and set design. Reminds one of a high school low budget production - at the Met! ""Minimalist"" it might be - but since was this something for Pushkin's Russia? It's painful to watch, and the performance breaks your heart in more ways than one."
2,Great singing but the production was very disappointing,The singing is splendid but the production was unacceptable to me. The lighting was so dim that in many places one could barely make out what was going on. The famous letter scene was sung against a dark blue background that was so dark one could see almost nothing. The minimalist scenery was dead dreary and what was there from time to time was so ill lit one could not appreciate it. Such a pity as the cast was good. If you just want to listen this is fine but if you also expect to watch this performance give it a miss. I doubt I will watch it again and regret the purchase.
3,not what you think,"I ordered this kit thinking the keyless entry remotes are include as in all the pictures but they are not, there like an extra $50, more than the kit itself. Pretty disapointed but after an aftermarket alarm install I should have remotest, so beware, other than that works good."
4,GOD CAN DO DIFFERENT AND NEW THINGS***,Love this cd it came in great shap with the jacket.Lexi has such a sweet & strong voice this cd is not however your mama's gospel but it is the gospel of today and it helps with issues that we are dealing with today but also it shows when Lexi was married and had just had her baby boy she sings about this time.It a moving cd with great work out music I love to ride my bike and listen to this cd.
4,Clever Book,"Very well composed. You should have it before you sit for the real test. Question explanations are scientific. Frankly, I was surprised that MSPress released such well organized, direct to the point readiness review book."
1,As if it was just the gold that built the german empire,"The book gives you the idea that if you can find a banker who can finance you, you can build an empire, regardless of who you are, and what type of a nation you have!!"
5,2nd grade teacher,found it to be interesting but does not tell about oregon and would like to know more about family.
1,Do NOT ignore the professional critic,"This movie is without any redemption, and that includes thesoundtrack. Now and then an absolutely insipid movie, suchas this one, has a few good songs in it - but the music usedhere is as noisome as everything else.Perhaps there are men and women somewhere who slatherto have sex day and evening, and for whom brief periodsof celibacy might be arduous, but can this be enough ofa challenge to be worth an actor's time - a producer'sinvestment - or an audience's interest? If your threshold forentertainment is somewhere under a dachshund's dewclaw,you may enjoy this.See Josh in "" The Virgin Suicides "" instead."
2,What Could you Expect?,"What you see in the previews is basically what the whole movie is about. Give up sex for 40 days and 40 nights. It looked to be a pretty amusing little movie. When I saw it, all it was was stupid sex jokes, not the greatest acting, and nothing really indepth. Nothing great and I'm glad I paid only 3 bucks to see it."
3,Well....,"I gave it three b/c I couldn't give two and a half. I remembered this movie b/c I saw it on the first day it came out. What can I say, it was my b-day and I consider any Josh Hartnett movie a gift to myself but this one left me kinda...Let down after all the hype. This movie seriously had me salivating to see MORE MORE MORE of Josh Hartnett (like almost every movie he does, blow dry being the exception) BUT I kinda got drowsy in the middle. Don't get me wrong the movie does have its moments, I WILL be getting the DVD 'cuz I'm a huge Hartnett fan and I LOVE Paulo Costanzo, but it left me kinda feeling indifferent."
1,Gross and Offensive,"If you are into gross and offensive humor than this is just the movie for you....if not, do yourself a favor and pass on it. Josh Hartnett is an attractive and talented actor....he should be embarassed by having starred in this trash."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"This movie actually started out okay, and I thought that Josh Hartnett's character was sweet. I didn't think it was that funny at all, though, and once the friends make a bet that Josh's character can't last without any form of sex for the whole period of Lent it goes on a downward spiral from ok movie to very bad movie.Curious to see how it all ends and if he makes it, I stupidly keep watching. The ending is terrible! Let's just say I agree with the ""spoiler"" reviewer from Oxfordshire, England about what the ex-girlfriend does.I should've just watched Pearl Harbor again. Don't waste your money on this. Be like me, and at least wait for it on cable."
1,Tommy Lee Hartnett .....?,"why is Josh sooo hot? he looks like Tommy Lee Jones jr. (Men in Black etc.)anyway this movie really is a stinker, god I was so totally annoyed by the bad acting, not funny plot -or- lines, another brainless teenmovie, comedy? I didn't get it, sorry 1 star and not an inch more!"
3,Hilarious yet lacking,"This movie was definitely hilarious. I think Josh Hartnett did a great job. However, I was not too fond of Shannon Sossamon's character. I don't know if she was based on anyone in particular, but due to the lack of development in her character it was hard to see her as anything more than the girls Josh's character was having one night stands with. I just don't see what made her different. They meet and barely talk at a laundry mat, meet one more time for Josh to ask her out, spend a whole day on a bus and suddenly are completely in love. Plus her character was very unforgiving towards Josh's goal and selfish thinking everything was about her. I just didn't like her character and thought they could have written a better woman character for him.Nevertheless, I'll still buy the movie when it comes out on DVD just because it was simply entertaining to watch."
3,dream,"I was hoping for more to this movie but it was good enough to watch through. Boy thinks he can go through Lent without having sex, and his life becomes a game."
2,This movie is terrible.,"Unless you're 15 years old, you'll think this movie is terrible. It is. Totally.You might ask yourself ""why is Beth going to go ahead and give it 2 stars if its so terrible?"" I'll tell you why. Shannon Whatsername is hot, and almost makes watching this movie bearable. Watch ten minutes, pleasure yourself, and then return to your day."
5,40 Days and 40 Nights-good for the whole length,"I think that this movie is really great! It combines a love story with good humor to make a movie worth watching over and over again. They even use symbolism, with ""tryst,"" so this is no pushover movie. It is entertaining, good quality, and the cast is excellent. Josh Hartnett is great; a big role for him is still yet to come, and he is the perfect person for this kind of ""make you feel good"" movie. Shannyn Sossamon, besides being gorgeous, is also really great. She was good in A Knight's Tale, and is also still a fledgling actress. Hopefully, I will see her in many more movies.Own this movie, and see it again and again!!! I love it."
5,40 Days and 40 Nights,DVD was hilariousDVD arrived in a very timely fashion.DVD arrived in excellent condition.
4,All you need to know is...Shannyn Sossamon!,"OK, so this movie isn't quite Oscar worthy, but it has one major bonus that makes it worth watching...and watching...and watching...Shannyn Sossamon is a stone cold fox.And yeah, although some parts are lame (the premise, for example) parts are funny, and the acting is pretty good. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who was a hottie in 'Stranger Than Fiction,' makes a cameo.And, did I mention Shannyn Sossamon is in it? Yowza."
3,It's not that bad.,"Ignore the reviewers and critics of this movie. It's not that bad. They start from a serious premise (e.g. some find deep meaning in the title) and of course are disappointed. I am a boomer who rented the movie for some nudity and laughs. I knew I wouldn't relate to the GenX sex-comedy genre based on some recent disappointing experiences (with the Ben Stiller type of comedies.) I didn't find the nudity satisfying and there were a few laughs with the Sienfeld ""Master of the Domain"" type of gag. But what captivated me was the chemistry between the two protagonists. I haven't found that in young actors in a long time. I found the love story between the two (without the explicit sex) very believable and refreshing. I wish the DVD had some more extras like the deleted scenes that the commentary talked about."
