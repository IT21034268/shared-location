3,maxim,"funny and interesting articles of novelty. Lets face it, When the new one comes each month i thumb through it to look at the cute girls then toss it to the side. If it features a girl worth a second glance that month then i may thumb through it again. great for passing time at work..."
2,Charged twice when u order!!!,Im not sure why but the price says $5.00 but they charge your account 2 times for $5.00.... Amazon has yet to tell me why!!!
3,maxim mag,"I received the first issue, I don't know why, but somehow it seems smaller, shorter and less quality than other maxim issues I have bought, maybe maxim cut costs, or they have a different print for amazon subscribers. The quality of the paper is closer to that of a tabloid magazine."
1,"If you've read one, you've read em' all.","The only part of Maxim magizines that seem to change each month are the women on the covers. Maxim should be awarded for being a top selling magizine while writing the same articles in each monthly issue. Articls tend to be about Women, beer, gagdets, and other semi-useless and fully useless crap. Some peices become blatently offensive, like in one article, Maxim was examining the things we gave Japan and the things Japan gave us. Japan has given us plenty of electronics and cool things for cheap, while Maixim proudly proclaims that we (america) gave Japan two nuclear bombs. Very clever stuff, congrats Maxim."
3,Was great now not so much,In the past this was one of my more favorite magazines. It was both crazy and hip at the same time. It was a little bit bad but not so bad you couldn't leave it in the bathroom when your parents were coming over. My last couple issues have been a big disapointment. I know magazines are having a tough time of it right now but the shear amount of ads is really getting crazy!! Stories are lacking seems like they keep getting less and less. Even at $5 per year I will not be renewing come Dec.
5,I love Maxim,I am 15 years old and i love maxim! Maxim has sexy sexy women in its magazine. Maxim is a 5 star men's magazine. I Love Maxim!!
3,my advice to editors (also worthy of readers consideration),"this magazine has too many gadgets. i'm a consumer of useful products but i don't want to be consumed by the product! putting cheap shiny gadgets next to scantly clothed wemon may be effective on you average low brow american, but not on chikiwawa. and i don't care for the wemon either. this is just chikiwawa's opinion, but i waould prefer mediteranian, and south american wemon only. (hispanic 100% or very little indian blood please) no anglo wemon. sorry but have grown up in america of parents of iberian descent i am sick and tired of this long legged, long skulled blond, heavy chested, blue eyed ideal of blond beauty forced on me by this racist society!"
1,Is this a bad joke?,"Unfortunately not. Maxim is the worst magazine ever produced. It reads like it was put together by a room full of eighth grade boys. The unfortunate thing is that it is the magazine of choice of today's frat boys. No frat house is complete without a well-worn copy of Maxim for the discerning reader. Every article has been written about two months earler in either Men's Health, Men's Journal, or Outside magazine. There are also many jokes in Maxim, most of which are [taken] from the Man Show. If you get bad grades, drink lots of beer, take steroids, and have a tribal tattoo, than this is YOUR magazine!!"
1,Still haven't gotten it yet.,I ordered this magazine on 8/12/09 - it is today 9/12/09 and I have yet to even receive one issue. Way to go Amazon... or Maxim - whoever managed to screw this up.
1,For Call Girls and Toads.,"you get pages of half naked girls, dumb looking geek boys, and articles that look like they were written by people who live at the unemployment office."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM DENNIS PUBLISHING,AMAZON MADE ME GIVE THEM A STAR THEY DESERVE NONE.I ordered a Magazine on 7/14/2010. Less then a week later and weeks before the item was to due to ship. I changed the address on the magazine subscription. I have yet to receive the magazine or a status update ( I have inquired 10 other times ) until this week. 05/01/11 that is 10 months after I ordered the magazine. Funny it's up fpr renewal.They ask for some more imformation all of which I supply and BTW is already in the chain of emails. Only for them to refer me back to Amazon. Unbelievable. I will never buy from them again. Don't answer questions for 10 months till it's renewal time and then you still don't help me. Keep you magazine. And maybe fins some new Customer Service Reps because this is not rocket science.
2,Target audience: 14 year old males,"I bought a two year subscription to Maxim, and it just ran out. I won't renew. The magazine does have pictures of some beautiful women, but that's not enough to recommend it. The interviews are some of the most insipid I have ever read. They tell you nothing about the subject of the interview, but only about the interviewer himself. The snarky humor throughout the magazine just makes me want to beat my head against a wall. It is tremendously stupid. It reminds me of listening to young teenagers talk. It's just absolute nonsense. I hear my brain cells dying when I read this magazine. The snippets of information throughout the magazine are geared towards the ADHD set, who can't stay focused on one subject for more than 30 seconds. Don't expect any depth or details on any subject, and the things they choose to write about are ""retarded"". In short, Maxim is toxic bubblegum for the brain. It's like MacDonald's food. There's just no reason to consume it."
2,Makes for Great Packing Material,"Certainly, this magazing will not make you smarter, but every once in a while there is a piece with some wit. However, if you are like most subscribers, and come looking for pictures, you may be disappointed, so be prepared to read to find some value here. Finding something to read here isn't exactly easy, by the way. Most of the magazine is comprised of ads. On the other hand, it's these ads that make this magazine so cheap. And, if you have to move anytime soon, you can use the pages as packing material for your dishes, etc."
1,Disappointed,"This phone was great for about the first 6 months of owning it and actually we have two handsets. On both handsets the #1 buttons stopped working then the HOLD buttons stopped working. A couple of months later the #2 and #3 buttons stopped working on one handset, on the other handset just the #3 stopped working. I called several local repair shops to inquire about repairing the phones because we spent a lot of money on these phones, and found that no one would even touch the phones, let alone repair them. We are disappointed and are now in the market for new phones."
2,"Starts well, but very dull second half","Ethan, the British privateer (and earl) who yanks Lady Grace off another vessel in 1805, makes one very dashing hero -- as long as they're at sea. The relationship that develops despite his belief that Grace is the mistress of the traitor who sold information to the French -- information that led to Ethan's long, brutal imprisonment in France -- is spritely.But once they're back in England, it's as if these two lively characters never existed. He broods. She pines. He's hostile and distant, denying himself the physical relationship he had once enjoyed. She's bored. As are we. I also read The Bride's Necklace, the first book in this trilogy, but this is probably the last Kat Martin I will try."
3,An Okay Book....,"I think I expected Ethan to be a little more of a forceful character, having read about him already. I found him rather timid. He and Grace never clicked in my opinion. Even in the end, they seemed more cordial than comfortable with each other."
3,Lukewarm.,"I have read all of KM's historical's and lately they seem to have about the same storyline and conflicts with slightly different circumstances. She has a very distinct writing style and it has become very predictable.If this is your first KM novel, it's pretty good, but she has written much better. Try ""Savannah Heat"" or ""Gypsy Lord"" for a more satisfying read."
3,"""Held captive"" theme with a bit brooding Hero","This is my 1st Kat Martin. As a fans of ""Held Captive"" Theme, I start to get bored with that theme in this book...and maybe I'm not in mood with a brooding kind of Hero, coz it make me a little bit brooding also. The whole story is great, good beginning, bored in middle but starting great on last 3/4 part. Not a keeper, but worth reading."
3,Regency,"The adventure begins when Ethan Sharpe intercepts Grace Chastain's ship. As the captain gets to know his new prisoner, he discovers she is far more than the traitor he believes her to be, and begins to fall in love with her. However, her past and heritage form a wall between them. Only if she can complete her mission to prove her father's innocence in a matter that caused Ethan soul deep scars can that wall come down.*** A broody hero, a high seas adventure, and intrigue combine to make for a thrilling romance, sure to please Ms. Martin's legions of fans. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,The Devil's Necklace,"Book was as expected. Looked a little worn and glue on spine was loose, but fine for what I paid."
1,Amazon Wrong listing,"I'm sorry but I bought this book by mistake. Amazon had it listed under Fr. Malachi Martin's name and not the corect name of the person who wrote the book. Therefore I had to send it back. Due to me is full payment plus shipping and handeling.Thank you for your time. I will still shop Amazon Books, this was just a simple error.SincerelyJennifer Schroth"
2,Go with the sugar on this one!,I am a big fan of sugar free products so I can sacrifice a bit of flavor but this was horrible! It did not have a sweet marshmallow taste at all. A bit bitter in fact. I would reommend the Monin brand of syrups for steamers.
2,Not Spicy!,I expected a more spicy product. I used as an additive as specified in our local paper recipe section.
5,Anything With Manson on it is a MUST BUY!,"This CD is the best !! Rock is Definately NOT DEAD! All I need now that I have this cd is some aqua net and a 77 camaro! It's got some of the best bands, Pantera, Anthrax, Nashville Pussy and of course the GREATEST BAND EVER, Marilyn Manson. RUN DON'T WALK TO BUY THIS ALBUM!"
4,hello!,"hello! i personally think that this is one of the best soundtracks i own, however, there is only one disapointment i have. durring the film, when Carleton Hendrix was in the instituation, there was an interesting song playing while he was walking around and i have no idea who it's by or what it's called. if anyone has absolutly any information on this music, please email me at fuzzybubble40@hotmail.com"
5,An excellent and accessible guide,"The follow-up book to Developmental Supervision, Carl Glickman's Leadership For Learning: How To Help Teachers Succeed is an excellent and accessible guide packed with practical advice and fascinating insights for educators at all levels, preschool through university. Chapters address such issues as criteria for objectively assessing teacher competence, and methodologies for working closely with teachers. One of the helpful appendix is filled with useful peer coaching forms. With its coverage of structures for classroom assistance, formats for teacher and classroom observation, and approaches to directive, collaborative, and nondirective work with teachers, Leadership For Learning is a first-rate book for educational leadership, supervisors, policy implementers, and school board members."
4,READ THIS BOOK IF...,"You are interested in nature or you are interested in Jane Goodall. It's a very informative book and at the same time that it is telling you about jane Goodalls life work, it makes you appreciate the nature of Tanzania (where she did her research for thirty years.)"
1,A tour de force which has little to do with Olson or his art,"The author belies a hostility towards his subject early on in the book by referring to him as ""Charlie"" as though he was the cop on ""Bad Boys"" who had caught the guy in the video who had obviously done something which gave him the right to speak condescendingly to him. In Clark's own mind Olson has become an unworthy father who he has to beat down. Wierd ! Totally misses the point of Olson's art which is that each page is different and a unique attempt at truth. Shows too how the Thruway West (oh Gunslinger) has obliterated belief in an actual earth of value. Which Olson's actual text does manage to keep alive."
5,Wonderful Edition,"This is a beautiful edition of Cheng Man Ch&#65533;ing&#65533;s text on Chi Tai Ch&#65533;uan. There are other translations of this text available, but this is by far the best for several reasons. First, it is hardcover, and the layout is beautiful. The cover has a color print of one of Cheng&#65533;s paintings, and there is an example of his calligraphy on the inside. The book is also larger than other editions I have seen, and the prints and pictures are printed larger and more clearly as well. The larger pictures of Cheng performing the Tai Chi form are especially useful. And, while this may not matter everyone, this edition of Cheng&#65533;s book is also the only one authorized by his estate, and contains a preface by Cheng&#65533;s wife. I highly recommend this book."
3,"Cliched, but still good","The first book in the trilogy begins to lay out the story of two elven twins, and the clashing of interests that occur once the slightly older of the brothers becomes Speaker of the Stars (basically, the king of the elves). While a lot of the story is basically a generic fantasy plot--with one brother marrying the love of the other, then the other finding another, truer love (with the former still having feelings for him, of course)--it's good to get a little of the backstory for the elven nations if you're already a Dragonlance fan. As long as you don't mind fantasy cliches, it's a good read."
4,Well made filter?,I replaced a filter that I bought at a parts store due to what I thought was poor construction where the two halves were not glued or melted together very well...with the possibility that the filter might suck air...a no-no for your transmission. This filter has a metal ring crimped around the two halves so there is little chance of air getting into the filter.
5,Excellent,This is an excellent selection of love songs for a wedding or just to listen to. I'd love to see a Volume two!
4,Good book for a good price,"This, like many of the other Phaidon books is very well organized. My only complaint is it doesn't have many pictures of her soft sculptures. Other than that, I would highly recommend to someone who wants an introduction to her work."
2,Ex-Colored Man,"It said no highlighting, but there is underlining throughout the entire book. Other than the underlining that it is ok though, I just wish I would have known about the underlining, I would have purchased another book then."
1,GONE -- AND HAPPILY FORGOTTEN,"A poor sitcom of the period, Gary Cooper miscast. Totally implausible, looks like it cost 50 cents to make. Not worth the time."
3,Enough Filler already,"Of the 12 episodes, only two invlove the main ""stillson"" plot. Will they be able to drag this series out as long as they did they X-files? Get to the point already."
2,The Dead Zone is DEAD,"The first season was very good, the second season was okay...but the third season, and now season four, have found the DEAD ZONE with out any creativity. It has become a 'crime of the weak' show, and thus it has become formulatic. They JUMPED THE SHARK on this show when John's power started affecting animals here in the third season...If you want to watch a far better crime show then watch Hawaii Five-0...here it's MURDER SHE WROTE with a mind reader..."
5,Very interseting and fun book to read!,"I bought this book on a whim, not knowing whether it would be as good as some people say, or if it would bore me to death. I'm glad I bought it! I'm a college student, and I must say that this is a very interesting book to read. This book has opened my eyes to so many things I have not noticed before! Why do guys avoid using urinals next to each other? What are pyramid scams and how did they bankrupt a country? And many more questions... The book is written in a humorous and down to earth style, and the best thing is that the mathematics of it are very easy to understand. This is a book you will definitely enjoy! You should also check out ""Why Do Buses Come In Threes?"", which is a prequel to this book."
4,Good for Jr. High and H.S. Animal Lovers,"This book is filled with information that's relevant for anyone who's considered working with animals. I learned something I definitely didn't know, that it's harder to get into Vet school than medical school for humans! There's also a wealth of information about less rigorous careers animal lovers can pursue, from Veterinary Technologist to groomer, including how much money these workers can earn. At book's end, there's a fairly comprehensive list of addresses and websites for those who want to do further reading/research. A good resource for those who'd like to make a living working with animals of all kinds."
1,Very bad movie. Not what you expected.,"From the description of this movie, it sounds like one of those Texas Chainsaw Massacre clones they made so many of during the 80s. That's what I expected: Not a great cinematic masterpiece, but 90 minutes of mindless entertainment. Unfortunately, this was not at all what I expected. The movie is about a guy with hallucinations and then goes berserk, killing people in a diner. This scene is a couple of minutes at the end of the film, and up until that point it's s a bad attempt at some kind of psychological thriller.Don't get fooled by the title, the plot description or the fact that this was written by an Oscar winning screenwriter. We all have our bad days, I guess. Don't waste your time and money."
3,Not the best book ever,"I read maybe 8 mysteries within the course of a year(not counting the works of Lawrence Block). If a book ever gets to point where I can tell what is going to happen next the author is not doing the best job possible.And the ending was a little weak as wellThat's not to say that I didn't like the setup or the characters, some of whom were absolutely hilarious, especially Pepper and her odd fascination with...well peppers.I made the same mistake I always make I read a book in a series out of order. Have to go back and read the entire series now."
5,Charter member of the big '3' keeps pace!!!!,"Not to be one-upped by Randy White or Carl HiaasenJames Hall has created another cast of less than typical characters for this latest Thorn escapade.He has allowed Thorns love interest to survive twonovels and has once again taken all of us south Florida mystery fans to the places we've been and the intigue we wished we had been part of.Perhaps one day we'll see Thorn,Doc Ford and Skink take on the bad guys!!!!"
1,eminem,"Bears by Online Book Review Justin Botham Courage strength and stamina are just of a few traits of that the characters showed in the book that i read. The book that i read was about a kid, his brother and his dad and the went on a canoe trip up north to Canada. Before they left for Canada they had to pack food that was freeze dyed and and had to pack everything that they would ever need on the whole trip. They packed stuff like orange juice, meat, water, clothes and medical stuff. When they were canoeing they would have to go from portage to portage and when the water ran out they would have to backpack all of there gear to the next lake. One night there was a big storm and a tree fell down and landed on his dads and older brothers legs and this kid had to save his dad and brother in the middle of no where. If you would like to know what happens with this kid and his brother and dad i would suggest that you get the book."
3,HIGH TECH NOON,"This MANEATERS entry has an interesting premise but doesn't live up to its potential. Set in 1890's Colorado, a small town is invaded by scorpion/spider like monsters who are from outer space and for some reason eat uranium.James Marsters stars as a convicted killer who is spared the noose when the monsters attack and becomes the town's savior.The effects are pretty good, but the movie never really takes off and the ending just happens without any real fanfare.A good concept haphazardly executed."
4,A Decent Movie,The computer effects were better than a lot of movies with a low budget. I had never heard of any of the cast members. To me a bunch of unknowns. Still they were good. There is one character play by a actress named Sanny Van Heteren. She plays a female bounty hunter who is so unlikeable I dare say everyman who watches this movie would love to kick her (well you know what I mean) The movie is a western with very unusual and a different type of aliens unlike what we are used to seeing. The reason the aliens are here in also different. Original concept. I liked it. Not a great film but decent.
3,Only If You Are a James Marsters Fan,"If you would pay to watch James Marsters to read a newspaper then this is DVD for you. It is kind of slow and although it is a spoof it takes itself too seriously, there were ample opportunities for the actors to have fun with their parts but that didn't happen. However, it does a nice job of revisiting the B horror flicks of the 50s. And it is still in my DVD collection because I love looking at James and the movie kind of grows on you after awhile. I gave it a three because it really isn't a good movie, only Marster's fans will want to add to it their collections."
3,Cowboy Spike,"I'll be honest, I bought this because James Marsters was in a cowboys/aliens movie. It was a little weak but I guess that should be expected. Cheap special effects, so-so story. But ok to watch once."
4,Knocks the socks off Cowboys And Aliens!,"""High Plains Invaders"" is an enjoyable film that takes on the time honored theme of aliens and .... In this case, the town of Amaranth,Colorado is beset upon by U238 seeking monsters. Much like the Wild,Wild, West series the mix of old west and future aliens is entertaining, and moreso than the big budget behemoth that nearly killed the western genre most recently.There is gunplay, science fiction, and even a little bit of escapism. Great sets, and even some reasonable acting takes place. The only name actor, James Marsters,turns in a good performance. The special effects work is reasonable, and makes the aliens 'realistic'. One complaint I have is that the guns clearly sound like SASS specials, no real guns in this one folks.Don't waste your $ on the Daniel Craig/Dreamworks films, look for this one. It's easily worth the smaller budget!Tim Lasiuta"
2,Not very good ...,"I did not have great expectations for this dvd - but this was worse than I had expected. To be honest, the only reason I had purchased it was because I am a fan of James Marsters ... enough said."
3,Great idea...but lacks of a decent budget,"Started pretty good, character actor/actresses were pretty descent, era costumesand buildings and feeling of being somewhere in the late 1800's were all there.At least, the invaders were pretty decent cgi and looked good. But all this canonly carry a movie so far. What we really wanted is a fast pace movie with lotsof good script writting, more people on the sets who would band together, buildtraps and try to eliminate the invaders, and would have love to see a army of thesebeings getting ready for a major invasion....but thats not what we get.We get a nice little story and a invader here and there. The townspeople shoot theirlittle peashooters at the creatures again ..and again and again. There are otherproblems..but for a tv movie it was descent and at least the actors/actress triedto make this movie work....almost did."
1,this stupid movie is tring to copy off of tremors,"this has got to be the worst ""b"" movie i've ever seen it's only one kind of stupidbug not very good an in my opinion SK the mist is by far more scarier i just bought the cd soundtrack to the ""mist"" it's exactly from the originall motion picture.if i could give it -* i would sci-fy channel has the worst garbage on tv as does chiller.jmo"
3,Very middle of the road,"While this is certainly better than some cookbooks, and the sole resource for Albanian cooking, it's really quite lacking.My main gripe is that there is NO discussion of what makes Albanian cuisine unique. Had this been a cheap cookbook, I would have been a little less disappointed, but for the price, this is ridiculous. Furthermore, it comes hardcover, something it hardly merits.There are some interesting recipies, but a lot are very, very basic. And if you're not interested in eating brains and entrails, a good number of the recipies will turn you off a bit.Two and a half stars would have been a lot more appropriate."
1,Los Chachaleros: Inolvidables: 20 Grandes Exitos,Unfortunately I never received this product. The same incorrect CD was shipped to me twice. Something is wrong with the cataloguing.
4,Awesomeness With Good Ideas,"I wasn't sure I'd like this book when I read it, but I loved it. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who has ever dreamed of becoming a full-time poet and making a living from their craft.Not all of these ideas will fit your personality, but Glazner definitely thinks outside of the box. He gives examples from other poets' lives as well as his own and you are never left without something to cogitate or meditate on. Read it twice. You'll love it."
4,Slow start.,"Meet Angie Amalfi, chef and freelance food critic. With her ""surprise"" engagement party around the corner, Angie is in a whirlwind of motion trying to figure out the details. Then a mysterious woman appears at her neighbor's door.Angie's neighbor is named Stan. He has just been drawn into the life of this woman and her baby. Now Angie must help the woman and Stan out of a murderous baby smuggling ring.**** A slow start but by the end it was a worthwhile read! Angie and Stan's antics are enough to capture any reader's attention. ****Reviewed by K. Blair."
3,oddly entertaining,"This series is hard to describe, in that the ""heroine"" is so stupid that you can't really like her, but the other characters more than make up for her. Is the reader supposed to like Angie and identify with her, or dislike her, or what? She's irritating in that she can't hold a job but acts like the world owes her something. She sponges off her parents, but thinks she deserves to live in luxury. It's impossible to imagine that any man would put up with her for long. But Paavo is an appealing character, as are Angie's family members, her neighbor Stan, the other police officers that Paavo works with, and Angie's friend who owns the gift shop. This book is an improvement on others in the series: it has less Angie and more of everybody else."
2,Strikingly obvious time-waster,"There was little to recommend this book except that it reads easily. Pages fly by like hours in an airport. The mystery was dead predictable in form, although the other might keep us guessing as to the exact details, and the characters are so wooden one worries about a fire hazard. The recipes were great, but I get the feeling the authors and readers who prefer this kind of book do not have much in common with the real world. I would not recommend this to anyone who is not stranded in an airport and wealthy."
3,A somwhat dated view of science,"Good in it's coverage of the theories of science of Jeans, Russell and Eddington.Bad in that he seems to think that God and mysticism have some place in a study of the philosophy of science.More modern works by Popper or Kuhn might be a better reading choice?I read in a mathematics book ( attributed to Pascal) that there are three aspects to the seeking of truth:1) existence ( finding of a concept)2) factualization ( proof)3) falsification ( that the negative to the statement is false) Joad is OK on the first two, but fails on the last.A lot of the pretensions of science and mathematics arebeing questioned by both the left and right.Global warming and it's causes have made sciencea target of attack. Major figures in the modern advance of sciencehave been openly attacked by even other scientists.None of this is new, but the result is that we need to renew ourconcepts of science and what it means and what it doesn't mean."
1,Is really this book so Terrible?,"if so,it's very pity ,because it is the textbook of my Algorithm class this term."
2,"Like ""Where's Waldo"" but with variables.","This book contains some good information, but it's written in a pretty annoying fashion. As other people have noted, you'll constantly need to flip back (or forward) pages or whole sections just to figure out where a particular variable or function was defined. It makes the book confusing and time consuming to follow. I'd stick with Cormen's book."
2,Do not buy this unless you need it for a course,"This book is not very clear, skips steps, and in general wanders around. This is one of the worst computer science books I have read. Unfortunately I had to buy it for a class; so unless you find yourself in a similar position, don't buy this book."
1,"Terrible, don't buy unless required","I had to buy this because my instructor wrote this book and homework assignments were from the book.The whole book is designed very poorly and I remember having to flip back and forth just to read it straight forward. Let me clarify. As an example, I would be reading a paragraph that refers to page C, so I would go to page C and that page C refers to page A, etc. It was just painful to try to understand what this.Today (after 5 years later), I use this book as an example of how not to write a book."
1,From Serious Student: Badly explained,"I'm a serious graduate student, I'm pretty good at discrete math and I've also programmed (in Ruby) every fundamental data structure and algorithm from Algorithms 4/E by Robert Sedgewick and solved about 50% of the 'hard' exercises from that book.I took a CS class that uses this book this semester; and I can tell you that subjects are badly explained. The explanations are not clear.I bought Cormen's Book, and that one treats every subject with better form. The only reason I need this book is because my teacher directs us to exercises from this book, otherwise I would not use it for my class, as I can learn anything with more ease from Cormen's book.Recomendation: Buy Cormen's book instead of this one. If you need the exercises, ask your colleagues for them, and use Cormen's book to understand how to solve them."
4,Readable algorithms book with lots of good information,I don't quite understand all of these negative reviews. This is a solid text for algorithmic analysis that for the most part is at just the right level for most students -- neither too theoretical nor too superficial for the important topics. The graph algorithms material is a nice improvement over the earlier edition. I've used this book as an instructor many times and most serious students have found it to be an effective complement to the material presented in class.
2,Considerably worse than the second edition.,"The second edition was arguably the best undergraduate text on algorithms. But unfortunately the 3rd (current) edition is a major disappointment. On the positive side, the coverage of graph algorithms was expanded; on the negative side, is everything else! The explanations are consistently worse than in the second edition. The description and explanation of Quicksort is particularly bad, in fact it's so horrible it should be ripped out of the book and thrown away. About the only use the book now has is as a source of exercises for professors to assign to their students -- fortunately, the exercises are almost entirely the same as in the second edition and are still the best set in any algorithms text.I have only one thing to say to the author; if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
1,Complete waste of the paper its printed on,"If you don't read anything else then just read this; get this book instead: [...] as it will save you unbearable headache.The author who wrote this pile of steaming excrement is about as organized as the contents of this book is and insists everyone use it for the gateway course he teaches that everyone needs to pass at my school. Without a doubt him and this book are what turned me off from regarding algorithms in computer science as something interesting to learn and instead reduced it to a sort of sadistic hazing ritual one must survive to move on to infinitely more useful (or at the least better taught) topics and courses.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, you will find it's usefulness is better served as toilet paper. The author should be ashamed of himself for forcing people to buy this piece of crap for his own class/profit when infinitely better books exist out there."
2,Drive blades on base worthless,I've had probably 6 blenders over the years. Always a cheap one until last year when my kids bought me the Cuisinart for my daily smoothies. My big complaint is that if the glass jar isn't seated just right the plastic drive blades at the base and on the jar spin the plastic right off! I returned one unit for replacement thinking it was simply defective. I was careful making sure the jar sat correctly but I continued to have flubs then recently stripped the blades in the base again. Based on what I've read others have had this problem with the Cuisinart and replacing the blades would be a bugger. I think I'll go back to my economy blenders.
3,"tinny, plastic, good ice shaver","This was to replace my sister's 35 year old Oster blender. When it got here it was pretty, had a glass container--always a huge plus in my book. First thing I tried was the ice....Perfect, better than my VitaMix...and it has an 'ice' setting. However, when we put in blueberries and orange uice and a banana and a kale leaf, it sounded like a cheap piece of work, tinny. And the plastic body is cheap plastic. It makes me wonder how long it's going to hold up. The 35-year-old Oster in my sister's cupboard sounds better, just doesn't do the job anymore. This one sounds like a piece of work and does an okay job, especially on ice. So, think hard what you want the blender for before you buy it. If it's for ice, get this one. If you're going to be using it a lot, save up the dough and get the VitaMix."
2,cheap parts ruin this blender,This blender has great power - which is why I bought it and the price was decent. The base (where the motor is) is nice and solid and metal cased. The glass jar is solid and huge. The part which I have BIG complaints about is the bottom part (which you screw the jar and blades into) This part is made of CHEAP THIN PLASTIC plus it is very very difficult to screw on tightly (to prevent leaks when blending) and even more difficult to unscrew once you finish use and want to clean it.
2,Buying Refurbished Was a Mistake,"I purchased this model refurbished from Amazon. When it arrived, there were scratches on the base. I would have thought the base would have been replaced during refurbishment, but oh well, I can live with that. From the first time I used this unit, there was an electric burning smell when running the motor for just a short period of time - I didn't put any major strains on this unit. I though maybe this smell was just normal when the motor was running, but it just died after about 4 months and 10 times of use. Also, the motor base is stainless steel as stated, but the handle and jar collar are just silver plastic. The jar collar can be difficult to remove when trying to access the blades for cleaning. When making smoothies, it did develop that annoying air pocket around the blades that keeps the contents from blending."
1,Do Not Purchase This!,"I would like to reiterate what several other reviewers have commented on. This blender was loud from the start and within a couple of months of daily smoothie-making, the motor started struggling and smoking. It turns out that the ""smoke"" was actually the smell of the cheap plastic cutting assembly, which ultimately melted down. This was the shortest-lived blender I have ever purchased, though certainly not the cheapest. Like many others, I assumed the Cuisinart brand name was linked to quality. I won't make that mistake again!"
1,Motor burns up,"I have now had 2 of these blenders and both of them have had their motors burn up. The first one I exchanged under warranty but now that this second one is having the same problem and it is outside of the warranty, I WILL NOT be buying another one of these.The second complaint I have is that pouring anything out of this blender is a disaster. It is pretty much a guarantee that you will spill it all over. This one product makes me not want to buy Cuisinart products ever again."
2,Looks good but that's where it ends...,"We just re-did our kitchen and went with all stainless steel so I bought this blender because it looks so good. But it's not very good as a blender. Our old, cheap, drugstore blender did much better.I have to leave it on about 4 to 5 times longer than the old one and there are still chunks of stuff. And I'm talking bananas, not ice. Then when you wash it the bottom of the glass part is a huge cup when turned upside down in the washer. As a result it fills up with filthy water until you take it out and empty it. Also the handle will fill with water and it s l o w l y empties while the machine is running and soaks the counter top. I will not buy another."
3,Not for a family - the processor is too small,"I thought that I would like this, particularly given that the motor is rated at 600 watts. However, the processor bowl is way too small for many of the things that I need for it to do, and the motor is not nearly as powerful as I was hoping it would be. Finally, it came with a just the most basic attachments, and it doesn't appear that any others are available. I am getting rid of it because I need something more ""serious"". It would probably be OK for a single person or a couple, or someone that doesn't do much real cooking."
2,What's next? Little House in the Graveyard?,"If you're fond of pioneer stories, be warned. This is not ""Little House on the Prairie."" In fact it's not a pioneer story at all, but a book about death, dying, the agony of grief, the bittersweet comfort of memories, and the importance of family ties. Given most publishers' current mania for hitting kids between the eyes with mature issues, they've succeeded here. Perhaps one day they'll again realize that kids want to escape reality with excitement, mystery, and adventure, not be bombarded with mature themes, or complex social issues. Espeically irritating were the jumps between modern and olden times so frequently that the reader was never drawn into either period. No sense of atmosphere was evident."
4,An excellent -- albeit not very Celtic -- deck.,"Conway and Hunt did it again. This is one of the most beautiful decks I have seen. The symbolism and meaning is ripe -- right down to hidden faces in rocks and colors in the background. It can be an excellent deck for both those who are analytical and those who just prefer to let the imagery spark their imagination and intuition.The only criticism that I have about this deck is that I question the claim to Celtic nature. In fact, the only thing that definitely touched on Celtica was the use of the Triskele drawn into some of the cards.Overall, a definite buy."
5,The Celtic Dragon Tarot,"From the authors of Shapeshifter Tarot, this is another home run. Tarot is correlated but emphasis is Celtic and chock full of dragons. Cards are works of art in themselves and to the intuitive, there is a greater depth of meaning. The spreads allow many explorations. You can use the author's interpretation of the cards or look deeply for the symbolism that exists within. There are also meditations and spells given. You can divine alone or with friends."
2,Celtic Dragon Tarot Review,"I thought these cards would be a great introduction to tarot for my husband. He loves dragons and celtic lore, so both in one deck would be great! I was disappointed in the art work and he is having a hard time connecting to them. Could be that he is a new to tarot, or that the seeker should really choose their own cards. But don't let this opinion stop you from buying these cards. If you are drawn to them, then follow your instincts."
5,A Good Deck To Get,I have been a tarot reader for almost 3 1/2 years now. I have gone through many decks and I have found this one to be one of my favorites. The art by Lisa Hunt is truly beautiful in itself and I have given fantastic readings with these cards. D.J has also included a book that includes the meanings as well as a section on spells and meditations which a very enjoyable to do. The only thing I'd have to complain about is the spreads that are included. They just aren't for me. Other than that I very much recommended it for the common tarot reader or for those who are just beginning.
4,Love with a reservation,"I am a major fan of Ms Conway's writings and insights. And the art work & symbology is gorgeous. But one piece of heavy handed propoganda is making the going slow. Polarity. Or the theory that everyone MUST have a male to compliment the female & vice versa in all magickal workings. The deck is fine, but the companion book is, again, heavy handed."
2,Jupiter's rings??,"Having an affinity for dragons and all things Celtic, I thought this deck would resonate with me, but it didn't. The colors are too washed out, her descriptions are different from those of other decks, sometimes seeming contradictory, and it drove me nuts that she kept referring to ""Jupiter's rings"" - it's SATURN that has rings, not Jupiter. She just lost credibility with me."
3,What about reversed cards?,"I'd like some feedback from some folks that have actually done readings with this deck. I bought this deck over the weeknd, and the more I look at the cards, the more I like them. But the authors state that they are only to be read in their upright positions. I've been studying Tarot off and on for about a year, and while I admit that reversed cards can be difficult to deal with, totalling excluding them seems a bit unnatural to me. I find it awkward to shuffle the deck in such a way that all the cards come up Upright. It lacks something. Has anyone read with this deck, but ignored the ""do not reverse"" admonition?One word about the accompanying book: I like it well enough, though after using a book like Anthony Louis's ""Tarot Plain and Simple,"" the card meanings seem a bit simplistic at times, and, in my opinion, there is something of an overemphasis on Wiccan philosophy. Just stick to the basics without the mumbo-jumbo."
3,beautiful deck but...,"i just bought this deck to replace an old deck that was ruined by water, and while i'm pretty happy with the cards themselves, the book and explanations are severely lacking. i do not like the switch of swords & wands, or the renaming of a couple cards. i'm not into dragons in a magick sense, so all the stuff about them was pretty heavy handed. but the part that made me put everything back in the box to return it is where the author said this deck is not meant to be read in reverse. that seems really unnatural to me, and although this may sound ""hokey"", it severed any beginning connection i had with the deck. unfortunately, i couldn't skim through the book before i spent the money on the deck.i recommend the deck for the beautiful artwork but i feel it's better to look at then to actually use."
1,A Bunch Of Junk,"I really hate this deck, it's an insult to dragons everwere. For One she knows nothing about dragons and seems to have this fantasy notion that dragons are like herself; feminists and believe all men should dress in little skirts. I'm frankly sick of D.J. Conway and her attempts to understand things she knows absolutely nothing about!Perhaps if she bothered to make these cards more like the classical dragon deck I would be more impressed."
4,LOVE THE CARDS,"I REALLY LOVE THESE CARDS, THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. I DONT LIKE THE BOOK NEAR AS MUCH AS THE CARDS. THEY TEND TO GO WITH THE OLD TAROT MEANINGS AND NOT ENOUGH ALTERNATIVE OR OTHER POSSIBLE MEANINGS"
2,"Lovely art, little depth","I'm a collector of tarot decks and have many both novel and genuine: this one, sadly, most definitely falls to novel.The art is beautiful and the intentions clear- but if you are looking for a genuine tarot deck, this one is not for you. The backs are poorly designed and make it easy to tell when one card is reversed and when it is not when face down; and the book itself offers no meaning to a reversed card. This cuts out fully half of the meanings of the cards and how they are to be read.If you are looking for a beautiful deck, then this is most certainly it- but if you want an actual divination deck, it's suggested you look elsewhere."
3,The Celtic Dragon Taot...,I Bought the set and it sounded very good. I think that it soundes better then it is. It is very complicated. The cards have great artwork and they are very nice to look at. It is a good deck but i would have chosen something a little more simple. If you like complications and time consuming definitions then this is the set for you. If you want something a little more simple and precise keep searching. Overall it is an Ok set.
5,Great product,"You'd be amazed how accurate the readings are... If you ask clear questions, you'd be given very clear answers :)"
1,"Horrible, Totally Ugly","Ms. Deborah has taken a wrong turn twice. When ""Things just ain't the same"" came out, I thought ""good, I like it"" but then it was overplayed and I realized theres nothing too it. When Deborah Cox had David Morales doing her remixes there definately was something there. ""Who Do You Love"" and ""It Could Have Been You"" were huge club hits, but at the time she wasn't big in radio. Thats why only real club goers will know those. She should have stayed with David Morales, she would be even bigger today. I dont see what the big hype is with this song, its a good song, but it would be better if Morales remixed it. The same with Cher's and Madonna's remixes, they are horrible, they all sound the same. Dance music has changed, but for the worse."
5,I think Deborah Cox hit the spot with this song.,Nobody's Supposed To Be Here is an excellent song. When I hear the lyrics it makes me feel I'm in here shoes because I know what she is talking about.There couldn't have been a better artist to sing this song. Good Job!
5,Slick device,This is a slick product. Not only does it save your aluminum fairlead. It also doubles as a winch line weight.
4,The desk,The desk it great. Though I still havent got all the pieces yet. A handful of important pieces came out to be defective. The best one is the nut with no threads.I called and let the company know. They accidently sent me the wrong parts. Now Im waiting for my second set of parts.Great company to deal with. Id buy from them again.
4,"Love the pen, but the ink cartridge exploded","To sum it up its a great pen. I like the .5 mm lead and so many of the multi-pens have .7mm, so it make this one a good choice. However the ink cartridge inexplicably exploded inside the pen about 2 month after I got it. I cleaned it out so its good now but it shouldn't have happened on a $30 pen. I have had free ones that didn't, ever. Probably just bad luck."
5,A Reliable Cross quality product.,"I've been using this pen for almost one month, and works perfectly well. Is smooth, in red or black ink, and the mechanic pencil makes this pen quite perfect for write, and for a very reasonable price."
2,"Good Pen, Terrible Writing","The pen has great weight and functionality. However, I was expecting it to write and flow good. It sucks. The G2 Pilot writes better for a fraction of the price."
2,"Good, not great","This is an excellent pen but a mediocre-at-best stylus. The pen portion does everything well; red, black, pencil. It feels excellent in your hand and is solidly built. The downside is that when used as a stylus I have to press down significantly in order for my phone to register the swipe. I have a free pen / stylus that I got from a trade show that is MUCH better on the stylus side. In the end this item is just ok."
4,Great multi-function pen!,"I have used this pen for several months now, and I have to say that it is almost perfect. It writes well, feels like a quality writing instrument, looks good, and getting refills is a snap. The refills last quite longer than I expected, so that is a plus. Also, there are four colors of ink to choose from (black, blue, red, & green), plus there is a PDA stylus that can replace one ink cartridge.The only gripe I have is that I wish it was a little thicker. This is a complaint I have with many Cross products since I have big hands, but the matte finish helps with grip over the polished chrome finish. Even with that gripe, I am ordering my second one since I lost my first one, and the quality vs. price can't be beat!"
3,Almost great,"Very convenient and solid feel. Major detraction is that the lead is not continuously retained securely. Pressing on the lead holder without the lead extended usually restores proper operation, but often must be repeated. Cross wants $10 plus insured shipping to them in order to examine and repair. They would not consider simply sending a replacement pencil element. Too bad because this is a good writing instrument."
3,Used to be great,"This model pen used to be great. After losing mine after a few years I ordered another one to find that the tip-switching mechanism feels junky and stiff (like it's broken even though it's not). Meanwhile, it's more expensive than it used to be. I don't particularly recommend it, though I don't know if there's anything better on the market."
4,Well Rounded,"I have always liked Cross pens. This one is my favorite so far since I can not only take notes with ink or pencil, I can redline documents as well. It is well constructed like other Cross pens, and with a modicum of care it should last you for years. It is easy to operate with a twist you go between black ink, red ink, and pencil mode. For those features I think it is reasonably priced and I recommend it for anyone that uses black ink, red ink, and pencils to write on a regular basis. A nice Valentine gift for men or women. Be sure to put it back in your pocket because everyone likes this kind of pen."
3,Average,I received it on time and found I get what I paid for. It is just an average pen. Nothing is outstanding.
3,Refills is junk for good multi-function pen,"I've bought 2 Tech 3 pens 2 years ago. The weight, multifunctional , and durability are exceptionally good. The problem is with the refills. It seems the original ink that came with the pen have markings FJ 0807 ISO 12757-2D and it was likely made in Japan; the black and red colors were consistent, brilliant, and dark.The refills didn't have these markings. The black and red had inconsistent streaks that were lighter; these refills are junk like they were made for $1 disposable pens and\or made in China. I used these pens for taking notes to scan and the deep vivid streaks are vital. I would pay more for the original refills."
3,"Excellent pen, but missing refills, extra leads, eraser.","I am very pleased with the Cross Pen. It is compact, stylish and very functional. It replaces a similar Cross Pen that I was happy with for two years -- until I lost it. However, my complaint (it may be with Amazon, not Cross) is that the description clears states ""Set includes 1 black fine ball-point refill, 1 red fine ball-point refill, 5 pencil leads, and pencil eraser; guaranteed against mechanical failure, "" but my Pen arrived in nice Cross box with no extra refills, leads, or erasers. I am disappointed, but will keep the pen, which is fine."
3,Nice... but doesn't feel like a Cross,"I was looking for a a pen and a pencil rolled into one, and i like my pens to be sleek and non-plasticky... i bought a tech3 some 3 weeks ago and have been using it every day since - and i tend to write about a couple of pages of notes a day.Tech3 as a writing instrument and the Tech3 as a Cross are 2 different animals. The combination of black & red and the pencil offer great coverage of what i need in my note taking - but the twist action is could be better, doesn't feel ""solid"" enough for a Cross, the instrument feels a little light in the hand. But it writes well and covers what i needIf it were not a Cross i would have given it a 4."
3,"Great, with the exception of a few problems","This is a nice pen, and I think that when people see me writing with it they know I am super serious about ink pens. However, this pen is not without flaws. To start it wrote in all caps for the first two weeks I used it. It was very embarrasing because everyone thought I was being a jerk. When I got that mess sorted out the pen would write a letter ""B"" anytime I needed to write a ""P"", and I could never figure out how to get the letter ""S"" to appear. It also claims to be a multi-function pen, but it was completely useless when I tried to check the tire pressure on my car. I would recommend this pen, but only to people who are interested in writing, and only words that do not need an ""S"", ""B"", or ""P"".Thank You."
4,Good multi-function pen,"This pen works well. It does exactly what I wanted it to do easily. It's more expensive than I would like it to be for an everyday work pen. I keep it in my shirt pocket and shortly after I bought it, I leaned against my desk while reaching for something and bent it a little. It still works well. Both colors of ink and the pencil work great and it's very easy to switch between them."
3,Good but could be better,"Let me start out by saying I am a pen fanatic. In general I love Cross pens. That said, this pen comes in handy with its two ink colors and a .05mm pencil. I like it for its convenience. But other then that it is a blah pen. The micro point cartridge is not your usual Cross point. It is more of a fine point, not a medium point as I prefer. Also, I prefer the heft of the regular medium point to the light weight feeling of the Tech 3. I gave the pen 3 stars because of the handy nature. Would I buy this pen again? Not unless it as a gift."
4,Pen is good for practical tasks,Registry of good practical disadvantage of the tasks that the average luxury pen too long from the top so that it does not fit with pocket clothes
3,The Street,"Overall my reaction to Ann Petry's novel, ""The Street"" was a positive one. I thought she did a good job of portraying life and the struggles one faced during the 1940's as not only a black person, but a woman as well. I found the storyline a bit hard to follow because she used a lot of detail in explaining everything, but at times the detail also added a great deal to what she was trying to protray to the reader. I thought the novel started off a bit meandering, but I was still pulleed into the storyline, wondering how Lutie would deal with the crisis that came along and what choices she would make for herself and her son. As I read the novel, I felt as though I could really relate to the hardships and struggles Lutie faced, the fear she felt, and the uncertainty of every decision she had to make. If you can follow along with the details and flashbacks that at times makes the storyline seem wandering, then I would recommend reading this novel."
3,"so good, yet so real","Ann Petry did an amazing job in her novel, ""The Street"", portraying the life of an African-American woman in the 1940's making a life for herself in Harlem. She uses a great amount of detail and flashbacks to show the setting of Harlem with Lutie as she lives through these tough times. And although the descriptions and flashbacks really add to the novel, the reader should be very attentive when reading otherwise they'll get lost in a flashback that they might think is the present. Even though the book begins at a very slow pace, by the middle of the book, it was difficult to put down and just when things seem to be okay the book's ending is very abrupt and took me by surprise, which took away some of my enjoyment of the book. But overall, Petry did a tremendous job of taking her readers to Harlem and living this young woman's trying life."
4,The Street,I enjoyed reading The Street. It allowed me to see through the eyes of a struggling african american. It provided a way to see and understand more clearly some reasons for racial divisions. The ending of the book was also a surprise. Its sudden twist with no happy ending reminded me somewhat of the ending of the novel Of Mice and Men.
2,Boring!,Ann didn't do a very gbood job on keeping my attention. She went into way too much detail and there were many times that I just completely lost all interest in reading it. It just keep going and going. The only good part about this book us the topic on black and white relations. I'm sure that there is a little truth to this.
2,Too Wordy,"This book gives deep insight to the lives of Afro-American people in the 1940's. Ann Petry went into a lot of depth on the reasons for the actions of the main character, however I thought that she went into too much detail when describing most situations, while other points were not described so that the reader can understand the main character's actions. At times, she would go into so much explanation that the reader would lose track of what is happening in the book. She used flashbacks to help explain the main character's thoughts, but in doing this, she lost the reader. The flashbacks are helpful in explaining, but are a little excessive. Yet other information, such as the influence that the grandmother and father, is not explained to the reader until later in the book. The main plot of the book did make the reader understand what it was like to live in the 1940's, but it could have been done with much less explanation."
2,me in my sad story,"This book was a long winded tail. That documents the life struggles of a poor colored woman. The story was overly dramatic and I felt no real connection between myself and charactors in the book. The book is so slow and excedingly discriptive, that you can read ten pages and get nowhere. A positive aspects of this book are found in the under lying story. A story of a white upper class family, that shows not only do the poor struggle in life but we all do at times. This portion of the story helps to give a little more valitety and balance, in that it give you a look at both sides of life. I do think that petry's story was heart felt and meaningful to her but it has no real appeal to those who don't want to be depressed."
1,What a let down.,"I can't believe the amount of time wasted on reading this book. It ended terribly. The whole time I'm thinking she'll get out of the street, but no in an abrupt end the author turns her into a murderer who deserts her child. Yes, it does a good job of explaining the way the world looked from the Black point of view... but I don't think anyone would want to be represented by the main character. I am so disappointed in this book."
4,Well written and understandable.,"Living on 116th Street isn't an easy and the detailed life of Lutie Johonson proves this. Living as a single mother with a young son, Lutie strives to give herself a better life by moving to the street. Her daily struggles and the people in her life show what the street has to offer. The book gets off to a slow start, but soon the characters emerge and the book is hard to put down. The use of imagery and vivid detail allows you to feel as if you live on the street too. This book gives you a better understanding of life and how things aren't always fair."
4,"Depressing, but good","I thought that this book was really well written. The great description that the author goes into made me feel like I knew the characters personally and wasn't just reading about them. By the end of the book, I knew the characters so well that I felt could accurately predict how they would react to the given situations they faced in the book. Whether it was Lutie or Mr. Jones, I almost knew what their actions were going to be before I read them. That understanding of the characters helped me get into the book and keep me interested in every page. The book is quite depressing at times but that is necessary to express the ideas of the story. What Lutie faced everyday in the story is what a lot of people face in real life. It was the truth and reality of the book that appealed to me and is also why I would highly recommend this book to all of you."
3,It gets good the last 5 pages...,"This book is nice & thick; I was so happy because I figured it would be a good long book to read.So I read, read, and read some more & I wasn't stunned or shocked until the last 5 pages of the book; that's when everything peaked. No exaggerations.Sorry to say I was disappointed..."
4,A Review Of The Street,"The Street, by Ann Petry, is a worth-while read. While reading The Street, you are able to view the surroundings around the main character, Lutie Johnson, through not only her thoughts, but also those of other characters. The street is a character in itself, in this story. It is to blame for all of the problems experienced by the people that reside in the buildings that line its sides. Problems that range from lack of money, to sexual frustrations, to utter lonliness, all of which are lined with the feeling of total hopelessness. Most of these problems revolve around the main character, Lutie Johnson, in some way. She has been forced to move to this street, because she has no money, her husband is cheating, everyone believes she is compiled of every stereotype that exists, and her son needs a better place to be. You feel for the poor lady as hope after hope and dream after dream are shattered as each day goes by."
3,Good and bad points,"The bases for this novel is very intriguing even though I had trouble getting into the book at the beginning. Ann Petry spends to much time on details that, to me, have no barring on the story. I kept getting lost and confused in the details she gives. Even though I got lost a long the way I still developed strong feelings for the characters. It also gave me a little insight into a world I know nothing about."
3,"Informative, yet drawn out","This book was both informative and drawn out. Petry uses a blunt style of writing, and she's not afraid to tell it how it is. Many parts of this book, however, seemed to draw out. Petry uses many descriptive facts, often down to the everyday meals they eat. Though in some parts of the book this can add to the environment, often the irrelavent details clutter up the point she is trying to make, or situation she is trying to explain. However, the layout of this book makes up for that. Petry uses a different approach, building each character up by allowing the reader to be submerged into their mind, from the pretty stable casino singer to the psychotic 'cellar man'. Overall, this book has given me a very real sense of what it was like growing up black in the 1940's, and i think that any young person still in their impressionable years should read this to get a better understanding of the history behind the black culture."
3,The Street,"This book was an in depth look at the struggles of colored people living in Harlem during the 1940's. When reading this book understanding how life was, was easy. The words were used so powerful and descriptive. The book may have given a few to many details, but it did a nice job of getting you to know how life was and the struggles that went on in the 1940's to colored people."
4,"Depressing, yet very true","I think that Ann Petry does a wonderful job creating for the readers Lutie's unfair, dark, harsh world in Harlem. Throughout the novel, I kept hoping that Lutie and Bub would get away from ""the street"". Her hopes and dreams became mine as well. I was very surprised at the end when this did not happen, and when something happened that I never would have expected. The ending is extremely depressing, however I feel that it makes the readers realize that in those days, and under those conditions, there were never any happy endings. I would recommend this novel to anyone who doesn't mind a sour ending, but a true, and grim portrayal of Lutie's life."
2,Remembering River...,"I would highly recommend ""In Search of River Phoenix"" for anyone wanting to gain insight into River's life and work. Barry Lawrence's book far surpasses the existing biographies out there because of his tireless efforts to get to the truth and squash the rumors. In this biography, River's story is told by his friends, family members, co-workers and there are even some touching rememberances from people who only met him once. River had his flaws, as we all do. However Mr. Lawrence's book brings out all the elements to River's personality, not in a gossipy, tabloid way , but in a respectful, insightful way. The reader gets a good sense about who River was from those who knew him. I applaud Barry Lawrence's thorough research and his dedication to honoring River's memory."
2,Not so good,"Some things about this book seem off to me. It has to do with the way the book is written, the way it quotes other books, and the way it presents certain facts. You will find typos and some factual mistakes throughout the book, too. Plus, it devotes pages and pages to quoting fans' ""supernatural"" experiences with River.I'm someone who is in fact actually open to the supernatural, but this is not what I was expecting to find here, and most of the testimonies presented sounded plain weird and out of place. I felt second hand embarrassment at moments. Stories from random teens who think River's ghost came to see them is not the kind of thing I would expect to see in a biography.Still, I wouldn't say it's an awful book. There are some things that are interesting about it. But it's not revolutionary, it's weird in a not so good way, and out of all the books on River that I've read, it's far from being my favourite."
4,He was a HUMAN BEING!,I'm glad I purchased this book- I held off for a long time because I did think it was a bit pricey but after reading it I'm glad I did. This book is so informative on River and this life- it was hard for me not to be angry at the end of the book when it goes into his death. Highly recommended.
4,Great book if you are a River fan,"In search of River Phoenix is a really good book if you want to know as much as possible about River Phoenix's life. There are many surprises about River's life especially concerning his very unusual childhood in South America, Florida and numerous other locations. Especially the troubling stories about the family's religious background and the consequences that had on River. River Phoenix was not the standard Hollywood movie star with a background anywhere near normal. He had many personal values that he followed, values that he was forced in some cases to abandon and thereby compromise his own personal integrity. I think ""in search of River Phoenix"" gives the reader a very good impression of this. I would definitely recommend the book to everyone who are fans of River Phoenix. But also to people who want to know more of the dark side of Hollywood, and the horrible consequences stardom can have on young actors."
5,Hugo Boss,This product was great and for an amazingly low price. Will definitely buy from this seller again!
5,Incredible Fragrance!,"I absolutely love this cologne! It smells fantastic, lasts a long time, and always gets great compliments!I had used this cologne several years ago, but had moved on to trying others since then. Other colognes smelled nice, but just weren't quite of the same caliber as Hugo. So, when it was time to buy a new cologne, I had to have this fantastic fragrance again.I'm glad I decided to buy this one again! It was like coming back to an old friend. This fragrance is the best around, in my opinion. It's also well priced for the 5oz. bottle. Do yourself a favor and buy this cologne NOW!"
1,Duplicate product,Please do not purchase this product. The product i received is not the original Hugo Boss. Hugo fragrance lasts long and the fragrance of the product i received does not even last for 10 minutes. Amazon does not even have a return policy for perfumes.
3,broken package,"never really got a chance to wear it ,box was damage with the product before i could open it ...im sad because i wanted to know wht it smelled like without the box smell taking over it"
3,OK everyday cologne,"I bought this cologne in Duty-free shop of Heathrow airport, and I did not regret it.It has nice, masculine smell, and best suits, in my opinion, winter offices - only use it sparingly, because some people find the smell too heavy.Hugo from Hugo both is typical men's cologne. While my friends love the smell, my girlfriend isn't a big fan of it, because she thinks that it's a bit too old for me.I tend to use this cologne in winter, and prefer lighter or sweeter smells in other seasons."
3,Smelled kind of cheap,This is just my opinion though. I tested it at Ross. It may just be because it was an old one or something. It smelled kind of similar to Aspen or something.
5,There is nothing better,"I smell this on a man, almost regardless of who he is, and I am his to do as he wishes.Fantastic scent. Masculine but not overwhelming.Delicious and yummy on a man's skin."
3,Good but not great,Got this product 2 months back with a lot of expectation.I'm slightly disappointed with the fragrance. It's good but I probably expected heaven :)) . But the price here is definitely worth the product.
4,Feels Good To Smell Like A Boss,"I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google. Anyways, it smells really great and lasts all day. I work in a corporate office and its 8 hour days and this scent lasts well pass the time i get home. Warning: you dont need a lot of sprays for this, a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go. I recommend this, it came well before the estimated delivery time, nothing was tampered with and it smells really great. Get this fragrance and smell like a BOSS!"
3,Not impressed,"Well I was actually expecting a potent scent, but apparently this is not that strong. I am not happy with this purchase"
2,It's Okay.,"I was skeptical if i should try this scent without smelling it first, but i did anyways.To be honest I'm kinda let down.I loved Hugo Boss's In Motion. So i hoped i would love this one as much, but i didn't.I don't think that this a bad scent,its just not for me and compared to In Motion, its just not as great."
5,excelent!,"it was excelent, on time, good quality and good price for these classic! i really like these product for everything."
5,espectacular,muy bueno el perfume. el olor es ideal para los hombres que les agrade oler rico. lo recomiendo. el vendedor muy puntual
5,Will Not Beat This Price,"Great cologne and there is no way you will beat this price. I have looked in malls, stores, online, and in duty free shops in airports all over the world."
4,It's Good,"Not much to say here. I didn't like the smell myself, but I knew some girls who did and some who didn't. So it's an experiment."
5,Simply Exhilarating :),"40$ worth Spent, The fragrance is simply breathtaking.Loved by all....every single person asks what perfume is this....my girlfriend adores it....and i m loving it :) Thumbs up Hugo :)Highly Recommended."
3,Quick delivery. BUT....,"So 3 stars, one for delivery, one for well-packed package and one for the smell.The delivery was super quick, the item arrived within 2 days. I think that's a new record for my experience with Amazon. The package was packed very well, HOWEVER, the perfume box itself is very battered and the bottle appeared to have been used. I've bought Hugo at department stores a couple of times but the box or bottle had never looked like the one I just received. This purchase was meant to be a gift, but considering the condition I am now embarrassed to give it away. Amazon has always been my go-to store but this time...what a disappointment!"
1,Counterfeit Cologne,The cologne is counterfeit! I have been a buyer of this brand (Hugo Boss) for 6 years and know what it smells like and how long it last. I went to my usual store to purchase and they were sold out so I decided to look for it on Amazon. After applying this cologne the smell was gone in 5 minutes! I notice the typeface print on the bottle is a little off from the normal bottle as well.Do not buy for this; this is not an authentic product be sold.
1,buyer beware - fake product,"I have bought may perfumes from amazon before, all were originals. Now I bought three different products and all were fake. I decided to buy from amazon because too many stores in South Florida offer fakes. Now the same happened here.Amazon: check your suppliers! This one is a criminal! Scent at first is ok, but wears off very fast. I want a full refund or guaranteed replacement with original products."
3,No packaging,"I was very disappointed to receive the Hugo Boss Cologne today to find that it was an open box and not cellaphaned wrapped. If I would have known this, I would not have purchased this product for the holidays."
2,Disappointing,"2 Stars for the quick delivery of the order.The scent was good, but was very disappointed with the longevity of the smell. Had to put on 5 to 6 sprays everyday and the smell wud go off within 2 to 3 hours. Now i know why they provide a 5 ounces bottle, becaus u wud hav to put 5 to 6 sprays everyday so that the smell would last alteast 2 hours, and 5 ounces will come for atleast 2 months at this rate of usage.Im of the opinion that Amazon doesnt sell fake, so considering this as an original, i would not reccomend this perfume."
1,be careful!,"This is not the product I wanted. I clicked a link from the product I wanted (3.3 oz. Hugo Boss #6)offering what I thought was the same thing in 1.7 oz. size. The product photo was the same as in the previous screen, but the product changed. I ordered it thinking I was getting the right thing. It wasn't. I notice now that the photo shown here matches Boss by Hugo Boss now and it no longer shows the bottle of Hugo Boss #6. Amazon won't admit any responsibility. Still awaiting credit and am stuck with paying shipping both ways for the wrong product. Not happy. You've lost me as a customer."
3,Good smell,"Good smell, looks great, backage and bottle is exactly like original but some times i think that is not the original, when you use it smells great, but few hours later you dont smels nothing, even on your clothes the smells gone fast"
3,Classic Cologne,"My latest obsession is with colognes and fragrances and I bought all 5 of the ones mentioned in ""So you want to start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon.com that was great, and others. They haven't all arrived yet ( darn it), but I have to say that this cologne is good- 3.5 stars. It's a brighter and more cheery scent (if there is such a thing) than Cool Water which is also pretty dern good, and less citrusy than Tommy. The price is pretty mid-range for the designer colognes that you might see at the mall."
5,I love Hugo Boss,I have been using Hugo Boss for the last 10 years and I love the way it smells.. all the ladies love how I smell in the morning when I walk into the office building. I tottaly recomend this item for any guy that like to get attention.Thank you Hugo Boss.oh the purchase and delivery from AMAZON was amasing also. super fast. even tho they said it was going to take up to 8 days to deliver it was withing 3 days. Awesome!!!
2,Old Stock !,"I have used this colgne for years. No longer available at local stores I tried the online option. What I received was OLD stock !! There was virtualy no scent left. I should have known better. Don't bother buying this item, great cologne, poor quality shipped to me."
1,Finally Arrived....,"Ordered this items and another, both were Prime Eligible and Both did not get here till a Week later.This was a gift,and I ended up buying locally..."
5,The real deal,"Shipping was quick. Great price. The real deal.I was a little leary about ordering a fragrance online, as you just never really know. The sent is good, it lasts a long time, and was a great price."
5,Amazing Scent,"I ordered this product two days ago and was so delighted to receive it so fast. This was my first cologne I bought many years ago, and I am so glad that I found it on here for such a great price. It has to be the best Hugo Boss cologne ever made!!"
1,"Duplicate, Duplicate, Duplicate","Dont buy from stores123. Its duplicate. When I bought from the stores, I can see the difference. Dont buy from stores123 :("
3,"HUGO BY HUGO BOSS FOR MEN, GOOD BUT NOT LONG LASTING","After sampling this fragrance in department stores (too many times), I finally decided to pay for it. I believe this eau de toilette/ cologne is the original made by HUGO BOSS. There seems to be so many different shades/ names being marketed by BOSS that I'm no longer sure which came out when.This fragrance is ""spicy"", ""woodsy"", light, and lasts about 2-3 hrs. I've used FAHRENHEIT for years, and although THIS HUGO is cheaper and more readily available, it really does not compare to Christian Dior's product (which has had only one incarnation). To my nose, this HUGO is passable, but its major drawback is its short ""halflife"". I think I'll go back to FAHRENHEIT after this 5 oz. bottle runs out (which I expect will be soon based on its ""short-lived"" fragrance)."
2,The box was not sealed,"The box was not sealed! its hard to know if this item was brand new or not, genuine or fake."
1,hugo boss,"is not original, do not buy this perfume.not buy not buy not buy not buy not buy not buy not buy not buy not buy"
5,A+,I love this cologne on my husband! It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Great scent for every occasion.
5,i love it,"I love this perfume because its aroma is soft fits my style, for me this perfume is made &#8203;&#8203;for me. I rate 5 star full expectation is all todo.es is a unique one of a kind."
3,vacation mess,"How would you feel if your husband goes on a summer vacation and you discovered he is madly in love whereas you have been cheating on him after the death of your daughter in a fatal accident and to poison the whole issue, your husband wants a divorse to enable him marry a young girl at your cost. but all of a sudden, you are pregnant for the man who wants a divorse and you are also crazy in love a fella. figure that out and your guess is as good as summer end. its a vacation of nemesis."
3,A good Danielle Steel,"I have been reading Danielle Steel's books for over 15 years now. Sometimes they do get a bit ""all the same"" with most of the characters being important, successful, beautiful people who live in ""stately homes"" and wear ""important jewels and furs"". Sometimes I think the characters are more about what they have then who they are. Despite this, I always enjoy her books - they are easy to read, romantic and make you forget about everyday life for a couple of hours while engrossed in the book. Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she has written. I enjoyed this book ... a woman (Deanna) who was never appreciated by her family for anything that she did but managed to continue with her love of painting and make a success of herself and her life without her uncaring husband. Showed us that you can do anything if you just believe in yourself. Loved the ending too ...."
4,Summers End but another beginning,"What I love most about Danielle Steel is that her books are always the beginning to a better life for the main character, and this one is no different. She has had, in my opinion, some ups and downs in her writing over the last few years but this is one of the ups for her."
1,boring with a capital B!!!,"I was bored to tears with the way this Danielle Steel novel started out. I couldn't get through the second chapter! I eventually put it down because it bored me so. What happened to Ms. Steel's usual good plots? And what mundane and unimportant problems Deanna has. I mean, I'll take her problems anyday compared to mine."
2,Maybe I'm Old-Fashioned and Moralistic...,"...but I found myself DISLIKING Deanna. Even though her marriage was more or less over, AND her hubby was having an affair of his own, that didn't make her decision to commit adultery a right one. Because of that, I couldn't cheer Deanna and Ben on; all the characters, in my opinion, should have ended up alone. ""Summer's End"" is a quick read, but only mediocre at best; old-fashioned romantic types like myself won't appreciate the adultery angle, and those who value good grammatical skills will wince while reading this book, as Steel apparently doesn't make good use of a proof-reader and/or editor. I don't recommend this book, and personally won't be reading it again."
5,Siummer's end: A Novel,"I enjoy Daniele's books when I want something light and fun, so I've rarely read one I didn't like. They tend to be similar in plot and content, but thats why I like them."
4,Summers End,"This was my first book read on my KIndle. I always enjoy Danielle Steel. Easy reading, fast pace, good ending...."
3,never end,"danielle steel's books are beginning to sound alike to me. the characters are all beautiful, thin, and lead a life style that most of us will ever know."
5,My favorite book,I could not put this book down! It was amazingly suspenseful with intrigue and passion. I have not yet found a book to read next because nothing compares to this one. I might have to read it again.
3,"Starts off slow, ends quickly and unsatisfying","If you can get past the first few chapters then we have a good story. Not great, just good. Amazingly, the vulgar language is not as prevalent in this book as the most other ds books. As the story progresses one does get to the point where you can't wait to turn the page to find out how its going to end.However, the ending, as in most ds books, is wrapped up much too quickly and is not satisfying enough. I think antagonists should get their comeuppance but that doesn't happen here.Its one of the better ds steel books but not her greatest."
4,Dark Electronic Machines,"""This album is very very good."" The title sums up the mood! Each track on this album has its own unique feel to it which is really amazing and brilliant. 'Recursion' and 'Rigid Body Dynamics' are totally awesome on all levels, and show Jega at his best. I do think ""Spectrum"" is a better album however, but it is more commercial/drum n bassy. Geometry is a really great album though, I bought it after hearing only one song by Jega! And im still listening to it 6 months later. If you cant buy it, borrow it/steal it. NOW!"
1,First Track NOT Original,"The first track: Alternating Bit, it COMPLETELY taken from a track from the movie TRON, composed by Wendy Carlos. Jegas nuances are weak and effortlessly arranged, emulated synthesizers. If you want to hear a true masterpiece look up the TRON Movie soundtrack. Wendy Carlos is a true pioneer of deep and moody MOOG synth sounds (she still own all her 1970's MOOG synths), and the TRON Soundtrack shows it."
2,switch on the ice T commentary,"I am a BIG Ice-T fan, but even I have to admit, the only way to watch this movie is to watch the Ice-T commentary version. It's an absolute scream! He obviously knows how poorly the film came out, and is not above telling us about it. Ice-T is, well... Ice-T in his comments. Be prepared."
1,"Awful, but hilarious.","Corrupt *is* terrible from an aesthetic perspective, but Ice-T's hilarious commentary is worth the price of admission alone. If you're an MST3K fan, or just a fan of hilarious terrible films in general, you might enjoy Corrupt."
5,excellent cd,"This Cowboy Mouth CD sometimes gets knocked, but I've never been sure why. It's a fantastic collection of songs and is my favorite CM release to date. ""Whatcha Gonna Do?"" is an amazingly honest account of Fred LeBlanc's breakup as he treks from city to city on tour while his soon to be ex-love is at home and they contemplate the demise of their relationship.""Bad"" is another classic, especially for Catholic school survivors. :)Griff's ""Outta My Way Back to You,"" is catchy. It's a fantastic CD to have in the collection."
5,If you think this cd is good- be sure to see them live,"Cowboy Mouth is the most hyper, fun, upbeat band today. They certainly know how to get a crowd going. If you think this cd is energetic, see them live- they're absolutely crazy. I wish them all luck! We love you guys!"
5,Just Good music. Nothing else can explain.,"If you like New Orleans, You have got to get EVERY Cowboy Mouth CD. All songs on all cd's are great. That is usually not the case, but please believe me. These guys are great."
1,Appalling quality,I should have paid more attention to the previous reviewer but all the typos in the previous review made me not give it as much consideration as I clearly should have done. This ornament does indeed look as if it is home made. By someone who doesn't care too much what the finished product looks like. I review very few items but this was so bad I decided I would post one. I bought 3 of them and would return them but as I am assuming I will have to pay for the return postage its not worth it for the few dollars I will get back. I was aware of the size which is exactly what I wanted but what you're getting is a styrofoam ball with small mirror chips glued on in uneven rows so you can still see exposed areas of the styrofoam. I am fully expecting the entire thing to fall apart in 5 minutes. What a waste of money.
4,Great little book,This is a great small book to carry with you to look up phrases quickly. Does not have extensive lists.
3,French Phrases Review,Good value for money.Much better value than my local bookstores who put excessive margins on these type of books.
2,Not the best phrase book out there,"This is a pretty thin volume. 750 phrases on 58 small format pages. (And some of the ""phrases"" are ""A peach, Une peche."" ""Some milk, Du lait."") In the beverage section there are 5 phrases. Fruits gets a total of 11 phrases. Hopefully it includes a drink and a fruit that you like. If so, you've got yourself the start of a meal!BUT, given its brevity, why all the white space? With a little creative formating, the same content could have fit on half the pages.There are better phrase books out there. Look around."
1,Rip Off,"If you can, buy this book at a bookstore. Looks great on the computer screen but old and cheesy when you get it. Also, the real price of this book is only $1.50! The phrases they give for each topic is very limited. Also, it doesn't teach you how to create your own sentences."
1,French Phrase Book,"I was so disappointed in the content. The reviews from Amazon were good so I trusted the comments. It is so limited in providing common phrases that I hear as part of social conversation. Also, it took such a long time to get this. The wait WAS NOT worth it."
1,Much less then expected,"I am in Paris now and was hoping to have a useful, small conversational guide for my outings. instead I have a guide with misspellings in the phonetic breakdown of the terminology, phrases such as ""serve us quickly"" actually recommended!, ""can you replace this with a salad"", and more of the sort.....I would not recommend this as a resource for business or pleasure in France... c'est finis"
1,Better alternatives out there,"Flimsy newspaper type of printed pages, too big for your pant pockets. I bought the Lonely Planet book later at Barnes and Noble, cost a few bucks more but it comes with a CD, a small hardcover book that fits well in any pocket. Besides the organization and selection of phrases are better. Also there are free ipad apps and online courses that provides pronunciation help."
3,Search Other Places,"This is a great book to have when learning french, but make sure to buy it somewhere else other than on amazon.com. The book originally is $2.00 and I got it on here for $4 because of shipping and everything. This book is slim and easy to understand but still lacks small essentials in fully understanding the language, so don't think to highly of it. I was somewhat disappointed."
3,Helpful But Very Dated,"A useful French language guide, which was originally published in 1956 and not updated since 1994. Most sections are helpfull, but a few are hopelessly dated (e.g., photography). Computers and internet are not addressed."
5,Very helpful,I love how it gives the translation in French and right underneath it gives you the phonetic pronunciation on how to say it. Very helpful and full of things to learn to help get around. I also bought this in German
1,THE WORLD IS A DANCE CLUB!!!!!,"This terrible five kingsize represents the world as a dance club...the lyrics are completely without substance and the songs are exactly the same...This sounds like a boring disco club with 9 years old kids dancing...This is a perfect example of lack of attitude, espirituality and musical taste!!!!HORRIBLE...if you like this kind of music try britney or beyonce..."
5,The best album!!!,"It was amazing. I have all the albums of Five, but Kingsize is the best. ""Let's dance"", ""Lay all your lovin' on me"", ""Rock the party"", ""Hear me now"", ""Feel the love"" and ""We're going all night"" are the best songs. Five was the best boyband in the world! It's a pity they don't sing anymore!"
5,Kingsize,"This album is amazing. Five definitly has done it again. They came out with more awesome songs than I can imagine. This is their best album. I ADORE all of their songs. I can listen to these songs all day long if I wanted to. I always set my cd player to Five so when I wake up in the morning all I can hear is Five. The songs are very full of pop, rock and rap, very edgy. Five are true masterpieces artists of writing, performing, singing and producing their songs. Their best ballad is ""Closer To Me"" which is definitely my song. I love singing and dancing to their songs such as ""Let's Dance"" which really makes want to get up and dance becuase I love to dance. I would definitely reccomomend this album. So go and BUY IT and you will not regret it."
5,Yankeee Pasha,"This was the first of Edison Marshall's that I read. It's a wonderful adventure, love story. It's the story of a teenager who must make his own way in the world after his family are killed by indians in the Adirondacks of New York. From there he travels to New York City to the only known relative he has with the only valuable he has which is a bunch of first class furs. After his uncle tries to swindle him out of the furs, he makes his own way in the world. Along the way he mets a beautiful girl who is kidnapped and as a result he travels the world looking for her ending up in the Middle East."
3,Funny but Serious,"M.T.I watched this movie for Spanish class. We were learning about how a quince is celebrated. In the movie the major characters were Marta Ramon, Samuel de la Cruz, and his family. The three major themes that were brought out in the movie were Immigration, La migra, no citizenship papers, and celebrating a quince for a girl. I like how the movie was funny at some parts and also serious when it discussed people trying to obtain citizenship. My favorite part of the movie was when Ramon's car door fell off when hhe tried to open it because it was funny. When you watch the movie pay attention to what happens to the gradener jorge. I would recommend this movie to movie watchers."
3,informative yet boring,"I watched this movie in spanish class because we were learning about family members, nouns and the tradition of a quinceanera.The beginning of the movie shows an additional quince. In addition the movie also dealt with illegal immagration and finanicla problems. I liked the parts when the INS showed up at the work sites because it showed how serious illegal immagration is and how oficers about deportation and aliens. My fvorite part was when marta help her family and a secret yet serious problem because this part was a very anxious moment. At times the film was over dramatic and the actor who played Ramon looked a little to old for Marta.""Funny yet Heroic, but the point of the title and the point of the movie didnt mix well,""says spanish I student"
2,boring,"I am a seventh grade student, who watched this movie because I had to for spanish class. Here is my review. If you are tired, get this movie. Unless you enjoy watching paint dry, you will hate this movie. My favorite part of the movie, was the credits. Also you would probably get better acting from someone with stage fright. But incase watching paint dry amuses you will watch this movie because it talks about immigration, spanish tradition, romance, and family. The odds of anyone being able to watch this movie without falling asleep at least once, are very slim."
4,wonderful,"I watched this movie in Spanish class because we were learning about a Quincea?era. Some major themes brought up in the movie were immigration, family, Responsibility, and a Quincea?era. My favorite part about the movie was when they talked about a lot of things not only a sweet 15. They talked about a lot of other stuff. I learned some new things. My favorite part was when she spilled the milk out to go get more so she could see Ramon and she came back and forgot the milk. What I didn't like about the movie was when Marta's dad kept seeing her everywhere and she kept getting caught. He wouldn't let her grow up. I would recommend this video to others because it's very interesting and you can learn about there Quincea?era and their traditions.-reviewed by a seventh grade studentE.P."
2,Educational,I watched this movie because I was learning about a Quinceanera. The major theme in the movie was when Marta was helping her father with his problems. I liked this movie becaused I learned alot of facts about a Quinceanera. The part that I liked was when Ramon's car door fell off. I liked this part because I thought it was funny. The parts that I didn't like was when Marta's father kept following her every where. I would recommend this movie to a spanish teached because it teaches you about a Quinceanera. Reviewed by a seventh grade student.
2,UNDER MY THUMB!,"This movie is a poor look into the lives of illegal immigrants. It's very stereotypical and it makes our immigration people look bad. The acting was also really bad, and no one knew how to show real (seemingly) emotion. The script didn't help either...and the casting was bad. Oh well, I just hope a better movie comes out for this sometime!"
3,muy bien,The sweet 15 movie wasnt horrible but it wasnt great i guess it was okay. Some of the parts are funny like when the car door fell.Although alot of the parts were boring.I thought some of the things they talked about were interesting. Well its about a girl who wants a sweet 15 but then other things get in the way.It is a good movie but i wouldnt consider watching it at home with friends or family.I watched this movie for spanish class.Well if you do watch it i hope you injoy the show.By a 7th grade student bcw
2,Boring,"I watched this movie in spanish class because we were learning about quincernera. This helped me understand a quincernera better and what it does to a woman.The movie dealth with immigration, Love, Relationship, and family. The movie was very strong.I liked the movie because there was great passion in the characters. It was interesting how marta de la cruz turned into a woman.My favorite part was where the children screamed !La Migra? because it showed the hardship illegal mexicans go through."
3,Excellent Review,"I watched this movie in Spanish class because we were learning about immigration and how some illegal immigrants were being deported. Some themes that were brought up in the movie were Quinceaneras, immigration, and Mexican cultures. What i like about the movie was when Marta got a surprise and she got to dance with the boy she liked. My favorite part of the movie was when Mrta helped her dad with a big crisis in the family. The part i didnt like about the movie was when a lot of the illegal immigrants were being deported because it was vere toy sad watching immigrants having to leave the country back to mexico. some men had families had kids and they wouldnt be able to support their families in Mexico. i would definantly recommend this video to others because it shows the troubles of immigrants getting into this country. this is a good family video too because everyone in the family could probably relate to the characters in this video."
3,boring but dramatic,"I watched this movie in spanish class because we were learning about Quinceanera , Mexican culture. Some themes/topics that were brought up in the movie were quince, immigration. What I liked about the movie was that it was dramatic, I liked that because it made the movie more interesting because Marta got mad at her father. It gave the movie more flavor, so it wasn't so boring. My favorite part of the movie was when Marta and Ramon kissed because they both flirted and got close to kissing and then they finally did. What i didn't like was how Ramon was acting towards Marta at some points. I would recommend this movie to spanish teachers if they're teaching his/her class about Quinceanera and humanities teachers so they learn about immigration. Reviewed by:7th grade student"
4,Great movie for class,I showed this movie in my Spanish 2 class. Although it is a bit old -- 80s clothes and hair! -- they still enjoyed it. It also really made them think about immigration. We also talked about the importance of the quinceañera in the life of a young latina woman.
3,Traditional yet heartwarming,"The movie shows you about a Mexican tradition called a Quinceanera also about how Mexican immigrants lived in America.The three major themes are tradition, immigrant, and love. All the characters showed their different points of view. My favorite part of the movie was when Marta helped her father because it showed she cared about her father and family.What I didn't like was how the girls caused a rucuss to the community.I would recommend this movie to any Spanish teacher who is teaching his/her class about Mexican traditions. One word to discribe this movie would be informative!"
4,funny,"I watch this movie because we had to for spanish class.I think the three major or minor themes in the story are that Marta like a boy named romon but her father didn't, after marta's father boss ask for his papers that he didn't have but made every body think he did he told marta that she couldn't have her party because he needed all his money just in case thay had to go back to mexico, and marta's friend told every body in the party that her uncle died so she can't have her party.I like that it had you wondering what will happen next and that it had action romance and a little bit educational. By: Mercedes clayton"
4,A gloomy story,"We watched this movie in Spanish class because we were learning about the Quinceanera. The movie dealt with immigration,deportation, the quinceanera,and family issues. I thought the movie was asi asi.It had drama and it kept you waiting for what was going to happen next. I liked that it dealt with immigration and deportation. My favorite part of the movie was when Marta helped out her father when he was in a bad situation. I didn't like that the Mexicans were being deported. I didn't know that they did that. I would reccomend this to teachers and people who are Spanish.I do not think this is for kids to be watching. i think this film was interesting."
3,Exciting,"I watched this movie because we were learning about Quinceanea. the movie dealt with Quinceanera, immagratoin. What i liked about this movie was how Marta really wanted her party and she tried so hard to not move and she got her dads jods signatures. My favorite part of the movie wasat the end when Marta got her Quince abd she was so happy because she really wanted it and she thought that she wasnt having it. No, because I thought it was really boring. thats why iwont recommend this movie. what i didnt like about this movie was that Ramon looked to old for Marta because she was about to turn 15 and he looked like he was 24<s> ♥ l.c ♥ <s/>"
2,exciting,"We watched this movie in Spanish class because we were learning about quinceaneras. I liked the fact that this movie brought out he true meaning of immigration, and still made the movie interesting. I didnt like the actress that played Gabbie, she just didnt play the part right. I would reccomend this movie to a Spanish teacher that is teaching about immigration, Mexican culture, and quinceaneras, i would also like to reccomend this movie because it is educational in an exciting way<s> ♥ v.p ♥ <s/>"
4,interesting,We watched Sweet 15 because It was a movie about a quince and they have alot to do about Mexian culture.I would recommend this to a family who injoy watchig movies togther.This movie was a great family movie full of real life experences that people go through ever day.I also thought the them was disimformitive and not in the right place for it at diffrent times.I also thought they could of added more on her quince then the fathers singntures.I recommend this moives to people who like to learn about diffent cultures intill next time!M.G
1,stupid,"I had to watch this movie in Spanish class because I was learning about the quinceanera. The movie dealt with deportation, immigration and quinceanera. One thing I liked about the movie was I learned something that I didn't know was how long it took to make a quince. My favorite part was the deportation, it was imotional. I liked nothing about the movie Sweet 15. I would not recomend this movie to anyone because it was a boring movie. D.C."
2,A Horrible Pea Soup,"This movie was not at all tasteful, but rather stupid. I swear, this was probably one of the stupidest and most pointless movies I have ever veiwed in my life! The actors were casted all wrong, and did a horrible job on their parts. This movie was a waste of time."
2,O.K but critisism,"I watched this movie, because it was part of what we were learning in spanish class. This movie was okay overall, but it's a little hard to rate when this isn't my type of style. I am a big critic when it come to movies so this wouldn't be my first choice, but again thos is okay for an educational movie . What caught my attention, is when Marta was not able to continue her plans have her quincinera, because her father was worried that the immagration would catch him, and send him back to Mexico. that was cool how the director set it up that ceated a lot of excitment. so it had a good story to it. My faveriate part is when Ramon was in the car and when he asked if Marta wanted to get in the door fell off.but this movie was good for who ever directed it."
2,Movie Review,"what i like about the movie is when ramon's car door fell off when he was trying to open the door for Marta to go and help her with things, what i didn't like about the movie was really everything but the major things was that what her father was doing to her and what was happening to her father and she did't want her cousin to dance with her at the sweet 15 she wanted a different person by her side oh yeah would i recommend this dvd to other i would say only to people who have to show the spanish class or people who like boring drama movie or peolpe who want to see a movie that about a birthday that they can get some clues for their party.reviewed by: A 7th grader Qj"
3,Bien,"Sweet 15 was a good movie.This movie we saw was for spanish class.We saw this movie because we are learning about the spanish culture.I would recommend this movie to others to find how it was for hispanic people live and or how and girl turns into a women.How one day she a girl at 14 and a women at 15.You can also learn about the immigrantions that were illegal.You will also learn about a quinceanera ,what it's all about.....!By a 7th grade student. R.L.F"
3,Muy Bien,"The movie Sweet 15 is an okay movie. It was funny, and also real- life themed. The movie was good, but then it could also be really boring. The movie was about a girl who was having her 15th birthday and she was Mexican- American. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they wanted to know more about quinceaneras, or if your having a quinceanera. I don't think you would enjoy the movie for fun. I watched this movie for Spanish class.By a 7th grade studeent M.T."
3,"""La Migra""","The name of this movie is Sweet 15. Some of the major characters in this movie are Marta de la Cruz, Mr. & Mrs. de la Cruz, and Ramon. Some themes in this movie were about immmigration, a Quineanera, Romance, and learning how to read and write. I watched this movie in Spanish Class and I'm glad I did. I liked the fact that everything turned out good in the end in the movie, like usual, very cliche. I also liked that Ramon showed up in a differant car every time you seen him. What I didn't like about the movie is that it was low- budget and some thing were act6ed out a little dull. The main charcters were good actors though. I would recommend this movie to Soanish history classes in middle school."
2,A Boring movie,"I am a [...] student in a class that is learning about cultures. I liked the storyline and how Marta helped her father. I didn't like the plot that much. My favorite part of the movie was when the door fell off of Ramone's car. The movie had bad acting. A few themes in the movie are..... immigration, family, love, friendship, Quincea?era."
5,informing,I thought the movie was that it taught me why a mexican girl becomes a woman at the age at 15 and what she has to do to become a woman. It also taught me that in order for a mexican girl to become a women she has to do a good deed for somebody else.
1,boring,"I did not like this movie because they wouldn't stop talking and it all went through one ear and out the other. The only good part is laughing at the dumb cars. this movie was horrible DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE it WAS WORSE THAN SELENA IT DOESN'T GET MUCH WORSE THAT. IT MAKES WORK FUN. IF WIFE BUYS, WORK OVERTIME!I DO NOT ADVISE THE WATCH OF CHIDREN THEY MIGHT NOT WANT YOU TO HAVE THEIR CUSTODY"
3,An interesting movie,"I liked how Marta was selfish in the beginning but throughout the movie she changed her attitude.She slowly learned that life wasn't all about her. I also liked how she realized that her family was the most important thing that she had. My favorite part was when she was snooping around the house and found out her parents secret. The secret she found out was a big surprise to me. I didn't like how everything seemed so fake. It didn't seem like a believable plot to me. I also didn't like the acting. I wouldn't recommend this movie just to watch for fun, but it's a good movie for spanish class because it teaches a lot about a traditional Quinceanera.From a seventh grader EJM."
2,sweet 15 review :by jeff jacoby,"this movie will help you see how boring it really is. it is about immagrants and there's no action. if you are spanish watch this movie. there is a 100% you will fall asleep,except the part when the romons door falls off the car. it has bad acting and makes no sense. the best part was when it was over. i hardly reconmend you don't watch this movie,but that is up to you.if you like movies that are about danceing watch this movie but it still is boring. it was no fun watching this movie. they solve all there problems and live happily. remember this is by a kid and it's my review."
2,Boringgg.....,"I am a 7th grade student who watched this movie because I thought it would be intresting. Infact, the movie was the worst. There was one good part of the movie and that is when Marta had to help her dad. It almost made me fall asleep. I do not recommend you watch this movie."
1,a boring movie!,"AAI watched this movie in Spanish class because we were learning about quincea?eras. The movie dealt with illegal immigration. I disliked this movie because it gives soft feelings to illegals by baseing the story of an illegal family trying to deal with their problems while other illegals are doing the same and gettting away with it. My favorite part was when the town tightened on immigration patrol. It was my favorite part because justice was served plus, I dont like illegals because my whole family came to the United States LEGALLY. Plus this family didn't have any working papers to let the U.S know that they were working here, even if they wanted amnisty ""forgiveness""."
5,"One of the best books I've read,","When I was 12 years old, I discovered ""science fiction"". I read all the books I could find at the public library, and all of the stuff out of the boxes of old books my Dad had hidden in the attic. If I had to pick 3 books that impressed me most, this is at/near the top."
2,Which way to believability?,"The aliens in this book are not the problem. The problem is the human interactions with each other, and the simplistic and unbelievable reactions to events that unfold. Shallow human characters defeat the high potential the premise had. It's hard to believe most of what occurs. Without being able to buy into the story, I simply had no interest in what happened. A forgettable book. Even allowing that it is fictional, credibility is stretched too far. The ""aliens"" were more convincing than the humans, who are unfortunately necessary to the story. I don't see the basis for the praise this book gets, though I have enjoyed other books by Simak."
3,"What would Wilford Brimley write? ""Way Station!""","If I needed a reminder of what sort of person just stays in their home and plays with toys and video games, I'd look around my apartment and stare at my boyfriend! Instead I read Clifford Simak's take on this oddly limp plot device- 2 days in the life of an immortal Civil War vet who stays in his house arranging intergalactic transportation for aliens with bigger fish to fry- and gives us this charming snoozefest. The aliens have zippy toys, good math skills, and better manners. Humans are petty war mongers, unable to rise above their fear filled natures. Although it's super soft sci fi, it's nice to be reminded of the fantasy that perhaps aliens could help us rise above our natures, that anything could help us rise above our natures. I even teared up a little at the end. Major points off for the here-and-there-and-everywhere plot, and a gross misuse of a beautiful deaf-mute girl as a symbol of human goodness."
3,Weak Hugo winner,"""Way Station"", the 1964 Hugo winner, is a dated tale of alien presence on Earth. The story describes a 19th century man, recruited to maintain a terminal for traveling aliens, and his interactions with the Earth and the aliens. It's interesting as an exhibit of 60s Science Fiction (preachy preachy!), but didn't hold much sway with me as a standalone read."
2,A Childish Exercise in Wish-Fulfillment,"Way Station is long-winded and silly to the point of being embarrassingly childish. Simak piles on coincidence after coincidence and wonder after wonder until you are infuriated at the degree of credulousness he expects from the reader. His narration is ponderous and repetitious, and he feels a need to explain the obvious--often more than once. He and his editor appear to have a problem with subject-verb agreement. As a fifty-year lover of science fiction, I am amazed that this book won the Hugo Award."
1,Total and utter garbage!,"The author of this book should really be sued under the Trades Descriptions Act for hyping an end product that is incomplete, inaccurate, and utterly fails to fulfill the objective outlined in the blurb.I was wanting to look at how Flash MX hooks to servlets and was looking forward to getting an understanding of this by examining the client-side and server-side code but guess what? The source code isn't on the CD! Even though the availability of the source code is much trumpeted in the pages of the book and on its cover.Absolutely disgraceful. The publishers should do the decent thing and refund anyone who had the misfortune to buy this pile of unintelligible drivel.How I wish I'd waited for some reviews before parting with my money."
1,Frustrating and Awful,"Looking at the average rating for this book, seeing 3 stars is way too good for this book. It fails on every level to deliver what it promises. The hope of learning how to construct an e-commerce site and an avatar-type chat room made me rush to order this book. I have read over 20 Flash books in my day and consider myself an advanced Flash user but I couldn't make heads or tails of what to do with this book. Basically, it forces you to type out code without explanation and when you are finished, it never works. Don't bother with this waste of time and money. Can anyone recommend a book that does cover the avatar-type chatroom? I'm sure there would be huge interest if someone could do this the right way."
2,Ideas is great.,"I have started this book. Began by setting up the database and server software so I could walk through this book. Downloaded mysql, tomcat and a jdk. Then went to cd , no installation. Wrote newriders and got a patch in one hour. (So they know but aren't publishing the errata's). Step One Claudia and Claire. Open the base_start. Did that. When it got to step 3. With ActionScript layer(This is where the whole chapter goes downhill). The figures such as 2.1, 2.3 don't match with what is going on in the steps. The steps don't match what is on the CD. Poor editing. If new riders has an idea that this book is so bad but aren't publishing the facts then I would not ! Buy this book. Nothing to do with the Author and Her Intentions but some one needs to read what they are publishing."
2,There's Better Things Out There,"Jessica is great. I'm on were-here all the time and really like the girl, and she's a phenomonal programmer, but her first attempt at writing a book could probably be parallelled to her first time riding a bike....failure perhaps? Hopefully she'll get up and write some more cause she's obviuosly got some genious in her, but they were definitely trying to get this book on the shelves instead of making it good. too many errors. VERY HARD TO READ. I'm an intermediate actionscript programmer and hard a hard time following a good bit of her code and then the explanations aren't even worth talking about. It also is very out of date now that 2004 is out, whereas the really good flash programming books are still useful. peace out-"
1,Badly Organized Book,"This book is definitely NOT for beginner. I am not sure if it is for advanced user either. Step-by-step instructions are not exactly clear. Author never really explain why she do thing the way she does. So, I alway feel like I am blindly following her instructions. The worst part is that she put the instructions on one page and then put the samples of Actionscript on 3 pages later. So, I always have to flip the page back and forward. VERY VERY irritating! I am often too lazy to write a book review, but this book is just so bad that I have to write my first one. I STRONGLY suggest people NOT to buy this book. You probably will learn more by going to the Macromedia Flash developer site than spending [money] on this truly badly organized book."
1,"Good concept, Badly written","I am in Chapter 3 now and the frustration goes on. First of all, I have to spend half of my day installing the supporting database and java class files that needed for the backend part of the book, which I have to download from the website since it is missing in the CDRom. And that I have to manually install since the auto-installer program doesn't work on my machine. Inconsistent labelling of components as you go through the chapters, which makes it confusing. Images of how your work would look like after several steps of instructions don't agree.The way it is written right now, you would not get the optimum benefits from it, as it confuses you, which is too bad because it is one of those few Flash books that focused on Web Application development.It badly needs a re-write."
1,Great concept - poor delivery,"Thankfully, the publishers fulfilled their end and supplied the missing .java files. Too bad the author didn't take the same initiative. Almost a year later, the books' 'support site' consists of the same message, 'coming very, very soon'. We won't hold our breath...this book is painfully written, has virtually no server side converage, and the writing suggests the author lacks a firm grasp of the subject matter."
4,A great book to learn how to build complete projects in flas,I am an instructor at a major university and an intermeiate flash developer. This book is really great to learn how to build complete projects using flash mx. The book walks you thorough several complete exampls which i find very useful myself and also for my students. It is very useful to understand the whole process that goes behind the development of a complex site in flash. You might have to supplement this book with one that has more details of flash mx. A great book for students that i highly recommend.
5,Not just a simple book !,"This book is a must! Jessie pussed her skills to the maximum and she wrote a book for all of FlashManiacs out there. She made some of the best, so far, tutorials/lessons.You can't even think how well structured this book is and you also you can't imagine how the actionscript is explained. There are no words or I can't think right now a word to describe this book. You must buy this book.Thanks Jessie for learning me hardcore actionscript.Chanki from were-here.com"
3,Problems with documentation for database implementation,"Cant find this dir and file. Needs better documentation for server inplementation. If someone knows how to install the databases, please let me know.Problem:-------------------Now create the datbases and tables.Windows:Run the .\dynamicflash\installDb.bat file-------------------"
5,Criminally underrated and underexposed.,"Gary Taylor is a great artist whose works most certainly deserve greater airplay and radio exposure. Unlike so many of today's so-called ""R&B singers"", Gary is truly a ""LOVE MAN"" whose heartfelt romantic ballads touch one's heart and soul. ""Whatever"", ""Sign My Life Away"", ""In And Out Of Love"" and ""Time After Time"" are your reasons for buying this CD."
4,Parametric Modeling with I-deas 8,"First of all, this book screams cheap; with regards to it's level of quality, or lack of. It is printed on low-quality paper, using what appears to have been a dirty Xerox machine. Extremely poor choice of materials and process for a book that, by necessity, is rich in illustrations. Thankfully, though, youcan't judge a book by it's cover. If you want a fast-track start in I-deas, this is your book folks. Lots of action here. Twelve chapters take you from the basic concept all the way thru to assembling multiple components. Basic concepts are well explained in this book,and it could almost be titled: ""Learn I-deas in 24 Hours"",assuming approx. 2 hours per lesson. This book will NOT teach you all the fine details regarding I-deas design, nor does it appear that it will be a very usefull future reference source. What it IS is an exellent tool to get started with. I'm extremely pleased with what I got out of this book."
3,The product description is wrong in the ad,There was no swab or cleaning solution in the package. And in the product description it clearly states that those contents are included. I just got the cleaning cartridge.
4,speculative and informative,"Heavily revised, this book covers every possible aspect of Ancient Egypt culture, from the invasion of the Hyksos to hieroglyphs, from Egyptian art to its religion. The authors discuss the reigns of several pharaohs, including Thutmose III, Amenhotep IV and Tutankhamun. Containing many black and white illustrations, this is an interesting and informative book for beginners in Egyptology."
4,Awesome design!,"They are well made and look exactly as they do in the picture, I know I'll have loads of fun with them... Once I soften them out!They are super rigid, which fortunately isn't a killer trait on a flat shoe... Otherwise they would be absolutely perfect"
2,Size big!,"These shoes are super cute-too bad they size big! I always wear size 9, but i should have bought a size 8 in these shoes as my heels totally lift out of the 9s (and as i live in france, it costs too much to exchange them). looks like i'll be stuffing the toes of my shoes too!"
4,Very nice puzzle,"This puzzle was a nice change from the usual ones we get. The pieces were unusual shapes, we are used the the more common ones. My 13 year old daughter ended up putting it together almost by herself. My husband enjoys them the most but he never got a chance to help with this one. It was pretty easy to put together."
5,The Game: Entertainment & Media,"Well organized book focused of the key sectors of Entertainment and Media. Provides great insight into the areas of film, broadcast, cable, music and sports. With inside information about the companies and players, this is a great read. Highly recommended for the casual entertainment and media observer to the corporate lifers in this business."
5,Worthy of Carnegie!!,"Victor's live performance is very impressive! The quality of his voice does not diminish without the aid and benefit of a recording studio--not many artists can accomplish this! The live band further enhances the listening experience, making it soar to heights so beautiful and soothing, without overshadowing Victor's brilliance! This is a MUST have for any Victor Manuelle fan!"
4,awesome A+++++++++++++++++++++++,"it is just an awesome, must have cd. one of the greatest cd's that i've heard from Victor Manuelle..........love it"
5,"Good story line, great character","I am not an English native speaker/reader, so most of times, I was being very picky on what to read, and Wild Cards definitely is a good book to read."
4,quite educational,I was surprised by how political it was. I was also surprised by how much action it doesn't have. It talks about the 4 aces. 4 people with super powers but their deeds are often not well described or put in some past tense. I like how close to actual history it is. 4 stars for the politics cause I'm a political junkie.
4,Nice Book,"This series is set in an alternate history Earth where a alien virus was released on Earth in 1946, causing some to die(""Black Queen""), some to get horribly mutated(""Jokers"") and very few, super powers(""Aces""). This is the first book in the series and is pretty much the setup/backround for the rest of the stories. Like most of the books, it is a collection of short stories written by a group of sci-fi authors that include George R R Martin, Melinda Snograss and Roger Zelazny(the whole first series was printed before his death in the mid 90s)."
5,A classic series yet to be fully discovered,Wild Cards is a comic book/sci-fi lovers dream. Putting superheroes/villians into the real world makes for the compelling drama.I read and collected this series around 8 years ago and have wanted to find someone else who read them ever since. Now that the first two volumes (out of thirteen) have been re-released I may finally get that chance. Not to be missed.
3,I couldn't get into the stories,"I purchased this because I *loved* the A Song of Ice and Fires series, and because I used to love comic books. Well, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I'd hoped. I found that with a couple of exceptions, I didn't find myself connecting with the characters, and the stories were not that exciting."
4,Get Wild,"While I knew the basic concept of the Wild Cards universe this was actually my first time reading anything set in that universe. Thankfully, the stories are written so that someone not up on the series can go in and enjoy the stories without being confused.The stories are all pretty good though there were one or two that seemed to run long. On the other hand the story written as if it was Hunter S. Thompson's work was sadly far, far too short. But I'm a HUGE Thompson fan so that's my bias there.Other than that the only real complaint I have is that not all the stories were 100% clear as to just when they were set. Yes, you could always tell that it was the 50s or 60s or whenever, but a clearer timeline would have helped. The stories seemed to have been presented in more or less chronological order but there were still some times when I was confused by the order of events.In any case this is a really great read for anyone who enjoys superheroes or historical sci-fi."
4,Hidden Gem,"Just read the first volume but I think he has something here. Love the concept and how it is interwoven into our global cultural fabric. Would make a great TV series.. Contributing authors keep the voice pretty consistent.. If you have some time, pick this up and give it a try..Not your granpappy's superhero comics!"
1,Garbage,"I bought this book because of George Martin's involvement with the series. He endlessly plugs the Wild Cards series on his website, so I thought it would be worth checking out. I wish I had not bothered. Cardboard characters, stale plots, cliche after cliche. Just a terrible book. I recommend you DO NOT BUY this book."
1,Greedy Publishers,"Really Macmillan?? You want to dupe people into buying a 23 year old book in eBook form for more than the original paperback book? $9.99 is outrageous for any book that is already in paperback and even more outrageous for a 23 year old book? How many trees did you use to publish the electronic bits? Zero. How many man hours did it require to convers to Kindle format? Zero since the computer converted it once and you were done. This is nothing but greed in my opinion. And for the rest of you folks who try and comment on my comment because it is not about the story, get lost. You are all feeding the Greed Machine if you buy the electronic copy of this book for $9.99 in my opinion and I don't care about your remarks. I will continue to point out the greed in comments ere and on iBooks as well whenever I see corporate greed like this. Go buy a used copy of the same book on amazon for $5 instead."
2,A Disappontment,"I have been aware of the Wild Cards stories for a long time as a reader of Super-Hero comic books well into my 20's. I am also a fan of Martin's Game of Throne's books. I was very disappointed with Wild Cards. Part of my disappointment was the style the story was told, jumping from character to character but not really developing any of the characters. I was hoping for much more."
4,Overall great read.,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because not all the stories are equally compelling. Great read overall though.
5,Amazing first book for an amazing series.,"I first read this book more than 20 years ago. To this day, it's one of my favorite all time books ( and series!). It's a pretty adult look at a ""comic book"" world with the right mix of super powers, sci-fi, and drama. What I liked best about the book and series was that none of the characters were perfect and none had all the answers to everything. Everyone was completely believable and the fact that it inter-twined real world events cemented it.Now with this new edition, a whole new generation of fans can enjoy this series. There was somewhat of a revival of the series a few years back and I'm glad they decided to go and re-print the original novels. What's even better is that this one has 3 entirely new stories, so even if you already own it, it's worth buying again.I totally recommend this book and think pretty much everyone would have fun with this one."
3,"Good ""Superhero"" book, a little dark at times","This is a good ""superhero"" book, but it is too dark for my taste in several of the stories. I personally prefer a lighter tone, likeSoon I Will be Invincible (Vintage). But I have still enjoyed most of it. Note, several stories have a strong sexual component so it's definitely not for kids."
3,Miranda and the Warrior,"Miranda THurston, daughter of US Calvary Major Thurston has been captured by the Cheyenne warriors! Shadow Walker, Cheyenne warrior, fierce and brave is wanted by the military for his many raids on the settlers and military camps. He gives Miranda as a gift to his dead mother's sister, and MIranda behaves shamefully so he decides to show her properly how to behave. He takes her on a journey to a peaceful place and there they began to get along. THen another Cheyenne warrior threatens to take Miranda for other things. So Shadow Walker has to face him, and wins! then he trades the cheif who was in the military prison with miranda and everything is back to normal. Then Miranda's father orders that his men shoot the cheif before he can get back to his people. Read the book to find out if Shadow Walker and Miranda get together and what happens to the Cheif!!!???"
2,Didn't love it...,"This book started out ok, but the middle and end were very disappointing. I never found the love story to be very believable, nor the decisions made by Miranda. I couldn't see the relationship of the two main characters lasting. They were so different in every way, with no shared views, and they didn't even really seem to be in love! The ending was totally illogical. I would have given one star but I did enjoy the beginning of the book so I gave two instead.... plus at least it wasn't boring."
2,The worst Avon True Romance.,"This book was the worst of all the Avon True Romances, and was the only book in the series I didn't enjoy. The characters were not realistic. Miranda was headstrong to the point of stupidity, and Shadow Walker wants revenge against the white people and that's about it. These two did not make a good couple at all. They came from two entirely different worlds. I found it impossible that they could ever have a chance of living happily ever after. Their love just wasn't realistic at all. The ending was abrupt and poorly developed. I loved the rest of the series, but this one was a huge dissapointment. I only reccomend it if you are a completist and want to read the entire series."
3,Not the best!!,"I thought this book was really slow in the beginning, and almost seemed rushed. I did enjoy parts of it, but I did not enjoy the ending, which once again ended abruptly. As the other reviews say, this was not the best selection to read from the Avon True Romance series."
3,Unmoved,"The Avon True Romance series has always been a guilty pleasure for me ever since I discovered them. However, Miranda and the Warrior was a bit of a let down. I liked it ok until the end, which sort of dropped off with nothing. I got the feeling that the two lovers probably didn't have a futrue together, which is not how I expected it to finish. I do not think that was the author's intention, but I wonder that the book wasn't longer, with a bit more closure. I found myself enjoying the relationship between the characters, but I didn't quite believe it. It all seemed a bit forced. Although, I always felt the same way about Pocahontis and John Smith, so maybe it's just me."
4,Love the Condor,"We have used the original Condor on the river in sun, wind and rain and found it to be very reliable. The angled sides offer lots of protection and flexiblitly. This ""upgraded"" Condor II, with the 2 additional sides , should make it even better. The option to remove them is handy too. Can't wait to get it !"
2,not for the weak,I have tendinitis so my hands weren't strong enough to make the plunger work. I'm sure it will be great if you are young.
4,Babes in the Woods an exciting book,"This is an exciting book about a group of kids in a group called the he-man club , who test their skills in the wilderness. This book follows the main character Jerome the clubs newly elected leader. On this trip to a nearby forest Jerome's Uncle and father try to scare Jerome and the he-men, but they have got something coming to them. In this wonderful book the he-men discover that Jerome's father and Uncle have been cheating by living in a trailer while the he-men sleep in sleeping bags and tents .Well , this won't go with the he-men and you need to read the book to find out what happens ."
1,Hope your up on your cooking lingo.,"I found this book utterly horrible. I am not a cook, and was looking for something relatively easy to understand. Things that I normally eat made over in a low fat or fat free form. Most of the recipes in this book I have never heard of. I would NOT recommend this book for those somewhat finicky eaters out there. If you do choose to order this book order a dictionary of cooking terms to go with. The other thing I did not like about this book was the first half (almost) of the book that preceded the recipes contained advice and information on dieting that was very controversial and was NOT recommended by several health magazines. With all the organizations out there trying to sell you on their diet plan, this was all I needed to find out a cookbook was throwing advice out too! Im very disappointed!"
4,"abou a (female) soul, filled up with traumata ...","The murders are committed exclusively by men - however all, because they are bedeviled by: Isabelle Adjani. With an easy attitude she and her film-director use nudity as a screen-attraction (1984) - though the subject of the script (1977) was about neurotic and psychotic manners, about borderline personality disorder, about hate - and about the fact, that revenge cannot heal a soul filled up with traumata. The climax of the growing mental illness of Isabelle Adjani (in the role of Elle) does not allow any typical Hollywood happy end ..."
4,I Almost didn't get this CD!,"I almost gave up on this CD. I've wanted it for so long. I kept not buying it, putting it off, etc. but I got it as a gift. And I'm glad I got it when I did, because if I hadn't I would be missing out on a great band playing great music. I especially like the songs by John Rzeznik. I wasn't fond of the songs by the other band members, but I'm sure that's just personal opinion. (But wait, isn't that what this is all about! ) I love ""Dizzy,"" and all the other hits- ""Black Balloon,"" ""Iris,"" etc.- but I especially like ""Acoustic #3."" Although it does have rather disturbing lyrics, it is a beautiful song after you listen to it.This CD is definitely worth buying, because all the songs have meaning and one does not outweigh the other. ""Iris"" was what first made me want this CD, and eventually I got the City of Angels soundtrack, but I'm still glad I got this CD all the same.So if you need a good listen, get this. (And try not to put it off TOO long.) :-)"
4,threading the line,"Goo Goo Dolls thread a line between melodic pop and hard-edged rock and this record is no exception. Rzeznic's voice matches the material perfectly with just the right amount of growl to balance the sadness-tinged lilt that makes their songs so poignant. Iris is excellent and was a huge hit but Broadway is probably my favorite, reflecting as it does on the ravages of time upon our souls. ""Dizzy"" is also pleasantly listenable all the way through varying from almost pure grunge-metal to the sparkly fresh acoustic sound that first launched them on an unsuspecting world with their freshman hit, ""name""."
4,The Goo Goo Dolls are Makin' it Goo-Good Music,"The Goo Goo Dolls ""Dizzy Up the Girl""1. Dizzy2. Slide3. Broadway4. January Friend5. Black Balloon6. Bullet Proof7. Amigone8. All Eyes on Me9. Full Forever10. Acoustic #311. Iris12. Extra Pale13. Hate This PlaceThroughout time, The Goo Goo Dolls has won a million souls with their soulful music. I on behalf would like to say that I love how they made their music a ""One of a Kind"" classic showdown. In case if you never knew, they were known to be ""Gospel"" music in a way, so it's kind of spirit lifting to hear their music that way."
4,"Good melodic rock, Great Cd","If you like good rock you can sing along to, and beautiful rock ballads, Then this is the album for you! Songs like ""Acoustic #3"", ""Dizzy"", & their next big hit ""Broadway"" are very good & catchy! Plus it also contains the monster hits ""Slide"", ""Iris"", & ""Black Balloon"" Buy it if you love good melodies & lyrics! Alot of people knock the Goo's for going mainstream, but what they don't is that music is a buisness just like the food buisness, & if only you & a few others like your product your not gonna sell it because people won't buy it if don't sound good! So far over 3 million people have bought & liked this Cd, So The GOO'S MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT!"
2,Headline: THE DOLLS SELL THEMSELVES OUT!,"Yes, it's true, one of the greatest alternative bands around have sold themselves out with their commercial success 'Dizzy Up the Girl'. With this album they have jumped into the pool of mediocrity. Please don't buy this album, and get the wrong idea of the Dolls. This is their worst album by far, although they started out as heavy rock 'Goo Goo Dolls' and 'Jed' they have become a more mellow band 'Superstar Carwash' and 'A Boy Named Goo' - which I prefer. Anyone who thinks this is the best Dolls album is wrong, because this can not be classed as a proper Goo Goo Dolls release, because the music on this album is nothing like any of their other stuff. If you buy this you should regret it, but if you like commercial sell outs, go ahead and buy it."
3,ditto ditto ditto ditto ....,"<i>Dizzy</i> gave a performance that was sometimes brilliant(Black Balloon), though often unremarkable(etc). After listening to a few tracks, their songs got tiresome and I almost fell asleep. I don't know what the deal is with Robby, but if I may be blunt, he sounds like a squealing rat."
5,An Excellent Album For All Music Lovers!,I never really had a thing for Goo Goo Dolls before but now I can't get enough of them! I am into emotional and excellent music and this is one of the cds that I play the most! The music is totally beautiful and the lyrics are even more so! Definitely recommend it to anyone! I love Johnny Rzeznik!
4,"If you liked this, try Tommy Keene!","The Goo Goo Dolls know Tommy Keene is one of the greatest songwriters and guitar players ever -- they recruited him to play guitar on ""Broadway"". Goos are good -- but do yourself a huge favor and check out any Keene album!"
5,nothing short of excellent,"Dizzy Up The Girl is nothing short of excellent. The cd opens w/ a rock edge on ""Dizzy"" and slides into slow, deep, tear-inducing tracks like ""Black Balloon"" and ""Acoustic #3"". This cd can only be described as an emotion trip. I'd recommend it to anyone."
3,Seek the Musical Roots,"Please do yourself a big favor and check out the Replacements works of ""Pleased to Meet Me"" ""Tim"" and definitely ""Let It Be."" I think you will relate to ""Unsatisfied"" and see how the ground work was set for the Goos. Don't get me wrong, these guys are good, but the Replacements were Gods."
4,Great music,"This CD is the most recent addition to my collection, and it's exactly what you need when you don't know WHAT you need."
5,A CD that lives up to itself!!,This CD was absolutely fantastic. Every song was amazing and I mean every single song. It was the best CD purchase that I have ever made. The Goo Goo Dolls have always been great and this CD really proves that! I recommend it to every fan of any Goo Goo Dolls song.
5,Great CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"""Dizzy"" ""Iris"" ""Slide"" and ""Broadway"" are the best songs on this album. Go out and buy it while you still can."
3,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I guess we all know the answer to that. ""Name,"" and ""Iris."" The fact that Name was an unexpected and unintentional hit, as well as perhaps the type of song least representative of the Goos at the time seems to go overlooked I guess.Anyway, the extreme sellout really ticks me off. There's not a single decent guitar solo on the album, and great roaring guitars were the basis of Goo music for their entire career up until Iris.All that aside, the album doesn't stink. It certainly has its own merits if you take it at face value (especially the last track, Hate This Place, reminiscent of the Replacements' ""Can't Hardly Wait""), which mainstream listeners who think this is the first Goo album certainly will. Well, maybe next time.Maybe the critical disdain they've recieved for the commercialization will get them back on track when the next album rolls around."
4,Magical!!,"This Cd is such a passionate display of MUSIC!! and lead singer John is a hottie! my fav song on this cd is Black Ballon.....and who doesn't like the song ""Iris"" Goo Goo Dolls deserved grammys for this cd..unfortulely they didnt win but the still are an awesome group!!"
3,"Actually, 3.9999. But I can't give it 4.","This is a good, well-crafted CD, with highlights just screaming ""Release me as a single!"" such as ""Broadway"" and ""Amigone"". But the CD feels too emotionless. It's something three teenage guys would record out of their basement. They're very good, but with only a few exceptions, the songs are more science than music."
5,I think it was one of their better cd's.,I like the song slide much better than I liked name. I can't wait for their next cd. They do a great job on everything they produce.
3,Great CD maimed by second lead singer,"""Dizzy Up the Girl"" is a great CD. Why 3 stars then? Well the member of the Dolls named John Rzenik sings most of the songs. He's got a great voice and is a cool person. Now, to my suprise, this CD also contains 4 songs sung by the bass player Robby Takac. I absolutely hate his singing voice and believe that it hurts the CD a lot. On my computer's CD Player I just cut out his songs so now the CD is a all Rzenik music, 9-track, 34 minute, EP of sort. The album would have gotten 4 or 5 stars easily with it's great songs like ""Dizzy"", ""Black Balloon"" and ""Iris"" but I have to deduct some points on Takac's part.Rzenik's tracks= 4 stars Takac's tracks= 1 starAll around this CD is an expensive EP for me. I'm glad I have it but I just wish they would have cut Takac's songs."
5,"Uh, this is the best!","This is a very good Goo Goo Dolls CD. Especially with Iris, Slide, and Broadway. I think you should get it! This is my dad's. I listen to it a lot.1. Dizzy - As a matter of fact, my dad doesn't really like this song, just that I do. Good song. 2. Slide - This is better than Dizzy. Still not the best. 3. Broadway - Now either this is the best song or Iris is. Because this is like one of the good four songs. 4. January Friend - I thought I knew the lyrics, but I didn't. It was ""she said let's pretend..."". Anyway, good song. 5. Black Balloon - Forgot about this one. I think this is all right. 6. Bullet Proof - I definately forgot this. 7. Amigone - I think, but I forgot it too! 8. All Eyes On Me - I didn't forget, that this is a good song. 9. Full Forever - Great song. 10. Acoustic #3 - Forgot. 11. Iris - Probably the best in here. 12. Extra Pale - Don't like it much, but it's okay. 13. Hate This Place - Better than track #12. Good song."
1,"Goes well with......I dunno, Pokemon","Pardon me while I clean up my vomit to make room for more vomit. Still trying to understand the garbage these kids are listening to these days. They call this alternative rock, and by that I think they mean alternative to real music. This music should be on sesame streets ""let's get funky with the alphabet"" hour or whatever they call it. Blank tape has more substance than this music. This group sounds like part of the mainstream corporate giant consisting of hundreds of talentless bands just like this one good for only one thing, killing good music as we know it. Ok kids, this music is ok for now, but once you get potty trained it's time to move on. That way you won't need someone else to help you remove crap from your cd collection."
5,A review from a buffalonian,"I've gotta say, i have to give major props to the band ""goo goo dolls"". With Johnny coming off of a bad case of writers block to produce their second ""pop"" album ( i say that because the goos were an extreme heavy metal band before their breakout, and released many albums that got no play. And really only people from their hometown.....buffalo NY.....would know that) Following up where ""a boy named goo"" left off, dizzy is an extremely high intensity record. With songs like broadway, and black balloon, which no one can get sick of hearing, The band has produced a winner. I bought this cd the day it was released....and the reason i'm reviewing it this late is because I never really cared for ... for a while.....but now i'm a believer and my voice shall be heard."
4,Great CD,This is an excellent CD. I LOVE the early tracks on the album the best! The rest of the CD is also great. A must have for anyone who enjoys great music.
2,Mats wanna be's not bad but not the mats,"it's catchy and the lead singer wears more makeup than a 70 yr old trying to recapture her glory days, but they are a mats tribute band and i'm afraid i don't agree with amazons review of the goo goo girls as a whole, like i said i've heard far worse (does the name bush ring a bell?) but they couldn't hold the mats' jocks. just my opinion................"
4,A great CD about life in the eyes of the band.,"Great CD. Best song at the moment for the fans and myself has got to be ""Slide"" with its great story and music. Defintely the Goo Goo Dolls best."
4,Awsome :),"Apart from Robby Tacak's songs, this is a great album. Johhny Rzeznik is an amazing musician, and I'm just waiting for the Goo's next album to come. Don't miss this!"
4,RZEZNIK ROCKS!!!,"I have several googoodolls CDs, but this one is the best! It is pure goo goo dolls, with lots of variety. Such as the hard but soft and meaningful ""Dizzy"" and Robby Takac with ""Amigone"". My favorite songs are ""Iris"", ""Black Balloon"", and ""Dizzy"". You heard da man. JOHNNY RZEZNIK KICKS!!!"
5,THE BEST &#9786;_&#9786; !!!!!!!!,"I LUV THE GOO GOO DOLLS AND WITH GREAT SONGS LIKE;ALL EYES ON ME,I HATE THIS PLACE,DIZZY,BULLET-PROOFAND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IRIS THIS IS A MUST BUY!!! all of the songs have good meanings, r thought pro-voking and some r quite touching and extremely well preformed!!!"
2,NOT WORTH BUYING,"i heard this cd because my brother has it. i can't believe he can stand it. the cd is monotonous and repetitive. all of the songs sound the same. well not exactly the same but there isn't much difference. this cd is so boring, there's not much else to say for it."
4,:),"this is a great cd. great vocals especially! the lyrics are a little weak but it is made up for in the vocals and tune/beat. every song is good and addicting! if you don't like the goo goo dolls, then that's your problem. if you do like them, try third eye blind too."
4,An absolutely amazing CD,"When I first listened to this CD, it touched my heart. Almost every song has lyrics that are so deep and moving that you look at life differently after hearing them. The key word there was ALMOST. There ARE some songs that are meaningless and they are honored with the ""Skip"" button on my stereo. I bought this CD expecting each song to be a peek at omnicient and everlasting wisdom. I was expecting each song to be an ""Acoustic #3"". Not all of them were, but buy the CD if only for that song. It will touch your heart like nothing else ever could."
4,great effort,"For a lover of mainly pop music, this CD was a welcome bit of variety. The songs are all heartfelt and exude honesty. My personal favorites are ""Slide"" and ""Black Balloon"". I also like the rock/pop of ""Iris"", the effervesence of ""Dizzy"" and the 1980s-style gem ""Broadway"".For a bit of a break from the commercial meaninglessness that dominates the music scene, try this CD. You'll be pleasantly suprised!"
5,"Powerful and melodius, every song on this cd stirs the soul.","The Goo Goo Dolls seem to pull their creativity from and endless pool of brilliance, and every song they release sends my head (and heart) reeling in an abundance of emotion. The truth in their songs is always evident, and their musical talent is beyond exceptional."
4,great music,john and robbie really have come full circle in the album. its a really nice listening album with catchy melodies and good lyrics. hopefully they will keep up the great work and not fall into the whole washed up band syndrome. its great!!
3,Long On Energy Short On Depth,"The Goo Goo Dolls certainly put forth a great deal of energy on Dizzy Up The Girl. The guys sure play their instruments fairly well even if its in an understated way. The drums sure drive many fo the songs. John and Robbie's vocal styles compliment each other well.However, diversity is not a strong point for this band. Most of the songs are mid-tempo rockers. By about the midpoint of the CD, you get the impression,""Gee didn't they just play that song already?"" Even the singles Dizzy and Slide are pretty identical although both are good. I tend to prefer the lesser known tracks, Bullet Proof, Broadway and Amigone as they rock along quite steadilly. Acoustic 3 and Iris are both a nice and needed change of pace for these guys.If you just want some good alternative rock n roll that does not need to be analyzed too much, this could be the disc for you."
5,Can anybody respect change?,"Come on guys! This thing has happened with virtually every other band out there. I am well aware of the Goo Goo Dolls' past history. There comes a point in most of a band's life when they wish to experiment with their style, and try something new. Most of the time, only their true fans like their new music, (Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Metallica, etc). This time, it hit big. The old Goo Goo Doll fans are angry, because they want ""Dizzy"" to sound exactly like their past albums have. New fans picked them up from ""Iris"". Putting that aside, this is an excellant album, that I was pleased with. If you like Iris, you will like all this Cd. Why does everyone hate the Robby Takac songs? They keep the ""punk side"" in the Goo Goo Dolls, to keep some old fans happy. Every song is good. I think after ""Dizzy"", their next single should be ""Black Balloon"". Buy this CD!!! You WILL be glad you did!!"
3,Accesible pop.,"Dizzy Up the Girl is a solid and quite intense album from the Goo Goo Dolls. Of course this album isn't perfect, there is a lot of filler but the songs released are absolutely their best ever like Black Balloon, Slide, Broadway, Iris, and Dizzy. My fave track on this album though is the short but moving Acoustic #3. Gutterflower has some of their best material, I would start with that album first. Dizzy Up the Girl is a fine album thanks in part to Johnny Reznick's stunning vocals. Rock on boys!"
3,"Good songs, but needs more","Their new cd is a great suprise, but I'd say the Goo Goo Dolls need to have one or two good songs to fully make this CD a 4 or 5 star Cd."
2,A lousy Replacements imitation.,"As a diehard Mats fan I really have trouble accepting the Goo Goo Dolls. Yes, Nirvana proved you could rip off a band's style (The Pixies) and still make good music and The Replacements themselves showed that trying to make a hit record does not have to be a sell out (The under rated ""All Shook Down"" and ""Don't Tell A Soul"") but the Dolls manage neither of these feets. The singers rock star asperations are barely hid beneath the super glossy production and over emotive lyrics. While many of the songs are very catchy, especially ""Iris"", none of them carry any realy emotional weight to back the musical force. So it all comes out sounding very big and hollow and much too professional and calculated. They might have a good, even great, album in them somewere, but they need a lot of changes for it to happena ny time soon"
3,Its okay,"Goo Goo dolls, in my mind took a step down with this album. They definitely sold out to make it big. The songs ""slide"" and ""Iris"" are definitely glossy pop songs intended to be top 40 hits. I have their previous work ""A Boy named Goo"" and i find this cd a lot more satisfying. Dizzy up The Girl is good but not great."
4,Not bad....,"Being a big fan of the Goo Goo Dolls, I picked up the CD the day it was released. Most of the songs are well done and 'Slide' 'Dizzy' and 'Iris' are outstanding. While it is true there is nothing new here in terms of style, I like their style and can recomend this CD. Buy it!"
4,"Good stuff, a little soft.","These guys make really, really good tunes. Too bad they had to soften up, this would have gotten 5 stars. If you like this CD e-mail me and tell me about it. (videogamer20@hotmail.com)word out to the guys of Reign, thanks for the e-mail."
3,"You've heard one, you've heard them all","""Iris"" is not touching enough, ""Slide"" wallows in clichés, and ""Black Balloon"" is Slide 2. But still, all three of them are okay. It's a pity that the band always sounds the same. They can't surprise with their originality even though they have potential."
2,A Boy Named Goo Two,"Their last CD was their best. If you must buy this, buy it. But don't get your hopes up. Its got some solid songs, but half the songs are written by the other guy in the group, and they blow."
1,Dizzy up the singer...,because it sounds like he's puking all over the mic. so give him a good reason to.
3,the great blink-thing,"I used to like this Cd. the songs use to be great, but they got really old really fast. If you want to get some good cds, pick up blink 182 or greenday."
5,"ahh, so beautiful...","the goo goo dolls are so unheard of over here but when i went to america i heard iris and i was hooked. dizzy up the girl hadnt been released over here so i bought superstar car wash and a boy named goo both of which are lovely if you give them a few listens. I snapped this baby up as soon as it was released and have no regrets. I love the whole cd, there is not one song i would skip over and that is an impressive feat on a 14 track album. I dont think i can recommend it enough if you want simple but pretty melodies and heart felt lyrics. They arent trying to be rock or whatever it is someone else reviewing said. They have their own original style. If you want to chill out and relax this is the one...Cant wait to hear their new stuff..."
5,A TEEN GIRL'S FAVORITE CD,"This is the BEST CD EVER! The Goo Goo Dolls put a lot of hard work into this CD, & it paid off. The best song on this CD(& the best song EVER) is ""Black Balloon"", even though ""Hate This Place"" & ""Amigone"" are also really cool songs. Johnny Rzeznik(the GGD's main singer and guitarist) writes poetic lyrics that people can really relate to(like ""All Eyes on Me"") , and Robby Takac(the band's bassist & also a singer) sings songs that are really happy-go-lucky(like ""January Friend"" )& that can put a smile on anyone's face. Also, Mike Malinin is a really, really good drummer. I love every song on this CD! I have every album & almost every single buy the band, and not only are their CDs great, but these guys are the coolest in concert! Also, I met the GGD on May 25 this year & they're really nice & cool guys. BUY THIS CD NOW!"
4,Goo Goo Dolls Best Yet,"Even though some of the singles off of this album have been tremendously overplayed on the radio, don't let that dissuade you from buying ""Dizzy Up the Girl."" Not only are those singles fun to listen to after letting them rest for a while, the rest of the album deserves just as much hype. This album seems to have a lot more diversity and flows much better than their previous releases. It is a great improvement for The Goo Goo Dolls."
4,One for the Road Trips,"I'm thinking this band had no idea they'd hit the big time with this CD, but I'm glad they've done just that. This is easily one to keep in your car and play on the road, with smooth, easy to remember lyrics, catchy anthems and a great sound. The tracks [like Black Balloon with an almost U2-ish intro sound] are so well played on radio stations that you can't help but hum the tunes in your head. Enjoy the ride!"
5,A BulletProof Work of Art,"From the opening track to the albums closer ""Hate This Place"" every song builds both musically and in its lyrics to show that all those who ever doudted this band need to REALLY Listen to what they have to say. You can hear and see the progession of maturity in the songs from their last album A Boy Named Goo. Naturally almost all of Johnnys songs are great and I think Robbies ""AMIGONE"" is his best cotribution. ""All Eyes On Me"", ""Bulletproof"", ""Acoustic #3"" and ""Hate This Place"" are all proof that The BEST is yet to come from this American Trio. The Dolls can write Love songs that Rock, without having to remind us of those so called sappy Love ballads from the 80s like Whitesnake and such. Don't overlook this gem of what will be considered a classic in the GGD legacy."
4,Very appealing music but. . .,What's with the title of Dizzy Up the Girl - that doesn't sound like a moralistic band as one reviewer just commented. Please explain - am I getting the wrong connotation?
4,Still good despite the changes,"Remember when the Goo Goo Dolls released the single ""Name"" and everyone was shocked that they could create such a soft and marketable song? I seem to remember countless MTV interviews. Apparently, they liked the attention that they got enough to warrant the creation of an album full of ""Name""s. Did they sell out? Who cares...the point is they're good at what they do, no matter what that is. Songs like ""Black Balloon"", ""All Eyes On Me"", ""Broadway"", ""Acoustic #3"", ""Dizzy"", ""Iris"" and ""Slide"" make this a totally listenable album."
3,A Nice Effort,"I greatly enjoy the Goo Goo Dolls' music. This album has some very compelling songs (such as ""Iris"" and ""Black Balloon"") that have beautiful, heartfelt lyrics. However, some of the other songs seem like filler. These other tracks are fine, but could have been better. I think that Johnny Rzeznik has written a better overall batch of material on earlier albums, such as ""A Boy Named Goo."" Still, this album is much more cohesive and touching when compared with other albums of a similar style (like Matchbox 20's debut). The Goo Goo Dolls are obviously a great band. I just wish that all of the songs on this album had just a bit more edge."
4,DEFINATELY WORTH BUYING!,"I ordered this cd off the net because I really loved the singles that have been released-Iris, Slide, Broadway and Black Balloon. I've barely listened to anything since.1#Dizzy- A great song that is very rockful with great chorus2#Slide- Great song. You've probably heard it anyway3#Broadway-Good tune. This song's lyrics are unforgettable4#January Friend- Takes a few times listening to to get used to5#Black Balloon- Slow but lovely song6#Bullet Proof- Another great rock with goood chorus7#Amigone- Like ""January Friend"" you have to get used to it8#All Eyes on Me- A great tune that stops you from turning the cd off9#Full Forever- Personally, I hate this one10#Acoustic #3- A sad song with slow tune11#Iris- That Beautiful hit12#Extra Pale-Another great let down: Too loud!13#Hate this place- Another great song that has that pop-rock tune to it.And there are all the songs. I think the albulm deserves a 4 and a 1/2 but they don't let you do halves."
5,Just A Great CD,"I saw the Behind the Music story on the Goo Goo Dolls yesterday. This band has an amazing story behind it. I love John Rzeznik's voice, the lyrics that he writes are so moving. I like Robby's song well enough, but the others on this CD just outshine it. Keep it up, guys. I luv ya, John :)"
3,Its all right!,I bought this cd for the song Iris hoping it would have some other good songs but it didn't except for Dizzy and Slide!
5,THIS CD WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!,"Before buying this one, i had never had a goo goo dolls cd. I have listened to their songs on the radio for so long but none really made me run out and buy the cd,then i heard ""slide"" and i loved it!! it was catchy and sweet and not too slow all in one! so i went to check it out and of course the famous ""iris"" was on it. the other songs sounded pretty good and they had variety so i got it. i listened to it about a 100 times the FIRST WEEK!! the songs are so great, the whole album is a wonderful mixture for whatever mood you're feeling, i strongly reccomend this for anyone!!"
4,Not going to bother to think of something witty.,"After hearing Iris and Slide on the radio several million times, I bought this CD. Though it took a few listens to get used to, I throughly enjoyed all the songs on Dizzy up the Girl. Both Robby's and Johnny's voices are unique and nifty sounding. I like the syrup of Iris, the harder sounds of Robby's songs, Acoustic #3 just because it's way spiff, and the album overall for the angstiness.I got A Boy Named Goo a few weeks ago, too. Also took a listen or two to get used to, but it's almost constantly in my CD player. I love it even more than Dizzy up the Girl now, and that's pretty much the only reason I'm giving Dizzy a four."
2,wtf is up with this...,Well well...This is not the goo Goo Dolls I was used to...I remember a GGD that used to rock...And now we're getting fans who think A Boy Named Goo was their first album...um...the Goos have been around for about 12 years or so...their first album was Goo Goo Dolls...and their second was Jed...check out Jed if you want rockin' goo...check out dizzy if you want imitation goo...
3,How do you spell SELLOUT?,"After hearing the first track on this album, I was immediately dissapointed. I'd heard Slide, and Iris, and I knew that the rest of the album would sound like that, soft and without any real bite to it. What happened to the driving, dirty rock that the Goos have been the kings of since Hold Me Up? Despite the enormous sellout, is still better than a lot of their early hardcore stuff. But still, I'm going to miss the stuff that rocked, the really great rock and roll that they've been playing on their last 3 albums. Maybe the next one will be better. What a shame."
5,The Dolls are Back!,"I was struck by the beauty of the song Iris last spring when the single first started playing on the radio. I had never really known the Goo Goo Dolls before that. I had heard the song Name, off of A Boy Named Goo, which is one of the prettiest melodies of the 90's... but I had never heard much else about the Dolls. Then I heard the single Slide. This prompted me to buy this album, and I certainly do not regret it. The songs Black Ballon, Hate this Place and Broadway are very well-written and well-sung songs. John Rzeznik's style is unmatched in the world of popular music. Also, the Goo Goo Dolls' new drummer, Mike Malinin, is very talented and certainly gives this album a well-defined drum base. This is my favorite album, by any artist. I certainly recommend anyone who loves alternative and/or rock to buy this album. You will not be dissappointed."
3,Pretty good...,"I really adore half of this album, but unfortunately i just don't like the songs that Bobby (I believe that's his name) wrote. Maybe I just got spoiled by listening to the Goo only on the radio at first then buying the album and i'm just really used to Johnny (I really hope i'm getting these names right), but i just don't like the Bobby songs. Other than that i luuuuuvvv this album and would recommend it highly, but if you only like Johnny...then you might want to program your cd player to only play half the cd..."
2,Rather bland and disappointing,"This CD is pleasant enough, but is ultimately too bland and calculated to appeal to anyone looking for any substance whatsoever. The Goos have made an album that attempts to appeal those who became fans because of the hits, ""Name"" and ""Iris"", and perhaps they have succeeded, judging by the number of 5 star ratings given to them. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that they aren't breaking any new ground. The songs are calculated and despite the soulful singing, fail to really fulfill what anyone looking for anything beyond a radio-friendly tune is looking for. Have the Goos sold out? Possibly. Is Dizzy a terrible album? No. ""Iris"" and ""Slide"" ensure that it has its merits - but for really compelling, enthralling music... look elsewhere"
2,"Take my CD, please!","I got this album last X-mas as a present (at my request though). I have listened to the CD two, maybe three times. Besides the songs that got radio play, ""Slide"" ""Broadway"" ""Iris"", I can't get into the rest of the album whatsoever. It's true, this is pop rock and it isn't good. I feel embarrased that I had a relative get me this album for X-mas. I wish I could give away this CD to someone who wants it, but that would violate review guidelines.If you want good pop rock, check out Third Eye Blind. I got into their self-titled album from front to back.You CAN'T get into this album. And if you can, then you need some serious psychiatric help. This album is very uninspiring and unimpressive. Zero musical variety... In a word: DANGER!"
1,Bland fickle pop from the Goo Goo Dolls,"Here's another band trying to cash in on the currently popular trend of ""bland rock"" popularized by the likes of Matchbox 20 and Tonic. Nothing to like about this group except, if yr a girl, a few pretty faces...the music is too dull and predictable to actually be enjoyed. This group used to be decent too, sounding a bit like The Replacements...now they are just after 15 minutes of fame with some lame Bon Jovi-inspired power ballads. Money ruins a lot of groups - add the Goo Goo Dolls to that list."
1,is this thing on?,"This used to be one of my favorite bands. Now, however they have reduced themselves to a paper cut-out clone of matchbox 20 or something along those lines. Johnny Reznick needs to go back to what he is good at - ripping off paul westerberg, not matchbox 20. spend more time writing good songs rather than wearing make-up and looking good on t.v. with his tank-top and spaghetti arms."
5,The best CD I own.,"I don't even remember why I bought this CD. I think it was because I wanted some more variety in my CD rack, but as soon as I listened to this CD, I was hooked. I expected to only enjoy one song, ""Iris."" But this is the only CD that I've listened to from beginning to end. I loved ""Slide,"" ""Black Balloon,"" ""Broadway,"" and ""Acoustic #3."" All the other songs are terrific, too. A terrific CD, one that I wore out from listenting to it so much."
4,They've got me hooked,"I never liked the Goo Goo Dolls, in fact I hated them. Then a friend bought me this cd cause she knew I kinda liked the song Slide [plus she wanted to borrow it ;)] But anyways, the first 6 songs are awesome even the first time you hear them. After listening to the whole cd and starting to learn the words, I found that the Goo Goo Dolls weren't so bad, in fact I could actually say I liked them and would check out some of their other stuff. All in all a good cd with pretty good to great guitar."
4,It took a while for this to grow on me,"I got this album about four months ago for ""Slide"" and ""Iris."" At first, those were the only songs I liked. However, I have really begun to appreciate this album for songs like ""Dizzy"" and ""Black Balloon."" I agree that Robby Takac's songs are not as well done as John Rzeznik's. His vocal style gets to be irritating after a while. Minor faults aside, this is a great album. Just be sure to listen to sound clips before you buy it."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"Before listening to the actual cd, Dizzy Up The Girl, I heard many of the Goo Goo Dolls songs on the radio and enjoyed singing along at the top of my lungs with John Rzeznik. I have enjoyed the band since I first heard them on the radio with Name, and have grown more and more fonder of them with each new song. The cd wasn't what I expected though. With four of the thirteen songs familiar, I expected more great singles. However, upon listening only a few more of the songs caught my attention. The cd has many enjoyable songs, such as Slide, Broadway, Black Balloon, Acoustic #3, and Iris. My respect grows for the band, as they write their own songs, something that has disappeared among many of the new hit artists. Overall, this cd is one that I will keep in my collection and continue to listen too. The Goo Goo Dolls have been anything but one-hit-wonders."
3,An unfortunate mix of music,"The first song I heard from the Goo Goo Dolls was ""Iris."" It was my favorite song for a while. Then with other hits such as ""Slide,"" ""Black Balloon,"" and ""Broadway,"" I felt that the CD would become an instant favorite. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD was filled with rock songs that I hardly enjoyed. The only song I liked that I hadn't heard before was ""Acoustic #3"" which is such a sad song. So even though those five songs are fantastic, the rest of the CD was a disappointment. The Goo Goo Dolls should definitely stick to the softer music."
4,Loved it but...,"This CD shows a lot of the talent that the Goo Goo Dolls have. Sadly, it also shows a lot of it they don't have. Let's face it, the Goo can't play classic/hard rock at all. However, they have such songs as Iris, Acoustic #3, Slide, Black Ballon, and Broadway which are great songs. I did not like the other stuff on the cd though. But, 5 great songs on a CD is rare, usually groups only have 1, and maybe 2 good songs on a CD. Because of that, I give this CD 4 stars instead of 3."
4,CD With Four Great Singles,"Dizzy Up the Girl by the Goo Goo Dolls is a good CD. The best song on the CD is Slide, I also liked Black Balloon, Broadway, and Iris. Most of the songs have a lot of guitar in them, and the rhythm is very similar. Even though I liked three or four of the songs, I found the rest to be kind of repetitious and I did not like them very much. Most of them have the same fast paced tempo and a lot of guitar, so there is not much variety. But I think it is still a good CD because of the four great songs on it. As I said earlier, Slide is probably the best song to listen to because you can never get tired of it, but I think that Iris has the best lyrics of all the songs. Even though the rest of the CD is average, I still like it a lot and would recommend it to anyone that likes popular music."
5,Wonderfull Bird Guide,"This is a well written and illustrated bird guide to all birds known to be found, however rarely, in the Philippines. The illustrations are of high quality, and often show male, female and immature birds, as well as the birds in flight. The associated maps are color coded so that it's easy to distinguish resident, migratory and endemic species. The plates with the illustrations contain a short description of the described bird, including likely habitat and voice. The later part of the book contains a much more detailed account for each species.It must have been an enormous amount of work to compile this book, since species are mentioned which have only be sighted once or a few times. It serves me well both as a guide to ID birds I had seen in the wild or in captivity in the Philippines, as well as a to teach me about Philippine birds in general."
2,Birds of the Philippines - maybe,"I'm using this book in the Philippines and found it to be somewhat unreliable. Many species are listed as uncommon or rare and not really specific to the Philippines but to more of Asia in general. I've seen many birds that are not included in the book and find it fustrating.The most use I've used the book for is to show children the pictures and make friends when language difference is an obstacle.I realize that maybe the Philippines is not as bird friendly has other countries, but expected more out of this book. Maybe this is as good as it gets and there is room for much improvement.I'm still glad I brought it, but just somewhat disappointed in the contents.Al Menk"
4,Wonderful Book,"The format is not as easy to use as other bird field guides, because there are fewer pictures, some pictures that do not show the entire bird or important features, and not as much information, but the quality is still good. I'm thrilled to have a field guide with only the birds of the Philippines, and not of the whole southeast Asia area."
3,10X50 binoculars,"These binoculars are worth the asking price, but like most products, you get what you pay for. They don't zoom in well & it's a bit difficult to focus. Still, they're better than not having any binoculars at all."
3,You & Me Baby Darla,I was very excited to get this for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it but unfortunately it quit working after a few weeks. Thought at first it was the batteries but we've tried several different brands and it still hasn't worked since.
2,"well, it does pee...","The doll first of all isn't all that cute nor is it very poseable which makes it very difficult to try and sit baby darla on the oddly shaped potty the manufacturer makes for this doll. The bottle provided is also difficult to put in the doll's mouth which makes it a bit messy, we wound up putting the doll's mouth under the water faucet just to get water inside. The doll does warn that it has to go pee pee but only after some of the water drips out onto your floor or on you. Its cries are annoying and loud, so overall I would not reccomend this doll as an effective potty training tool. After my frustration of trying to use this doll to help my daughter train, I was very disappointed for shelling out $25 on something that wasn't worth the money."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!,I got this for my daughter's 2nd birthday gift and I wish I had opened it and tried it out before I gave it to her. The doll won't stop saying it has to go and when you put it on the potty it makes the done noise but nothing comes out so you put the bottoms back on and all of a sudden it says it has to go again. I ended up taking the batteries out of it and just letting her play with the doll. She loves the doll and takes it every where we go so I hate to return it since see would be very upset Darla was not here. I almost need to contact the company get one that works and then send the bad one back. Overall I would never of given the doll to her in the first place there has to be one that works better for this age group.
5,excelente y hermosa,"una de las mejores novelas escritas sobre personajes femeninos. novela que a toda mujer hara pensar en su madre y la mirara de una manera diferente. pocas veces vemos a nuestras madres como mujeres con su propia historia, con vida sexual y jamas pensamos en ellas como capaces de llevar una vida oculta. hermosa, hermosa. conoci a la autora y era un ser tan especial y extraordinario como las protagonistas de sus historias."
4,"bastante bueno...,,,OK","La narracion de esta novela es buena. Trata un tema poco usual, el adulterio femenino. Describe la situacion de una madre, casada que quiere cumplir su deseo de ser doctora y decide regresar a estudiar, y en el proceso se envuelve en una situacion romantica muy particular. Lo interesante es quien lo narra: la hija. La situacion es traida desde un punto de vista muy interesante ya que envuelve una interogante: Hasta que punto tienen los hijos el derecho de conocer la vida intima de los padres?Las intimidades son descritas con bastante exactitud, mayormente desde un punto de vista femenino.El escenario es presentado de una forma tan detallada, pero no aburrida, que aquellas personas que conocen el area de San Juan de Puerto Rico se van a sentir maravillosamente envueltos, es como estar caminando y viendo lo mismo que ve el personaje."
4,underrated !!!!,"this cd is very well produced ...sounds very good.....and the raps they have good control ..if you like young bleed , concentration camp..this is better"
5,"HENRY MANCINI'S MUSICAL SCORING IS A HIT, ALONG WITH SOLID SCRIPTS","I still listen to Henry Mancini's compositions for Shows like ""Peter Gunn"" and ""Mr. Lucky."" Craig Stevens, Herschel Bernardi, and Lola Albright are a perfect combination!!!!!"
3,Jury Still Out,"I was a teenager when Peter Gun appeared on television. It was my first introduction to the wonderful music composer Henry Mancini. Mancini's music runs throughout this series. I am pleased that it has finally been released, however, let's see what the video and audio quality is before making the plunge. At nearly one hundred dollars one would expect the video and audio to be of high quality. If so, I will be in line to make a purchase. Other vintage series have been released in the past with less than stellar video and audio. At least they are releasing the entire series all at once. Route 66 (another all time favorite of mine) was released in volumes with the last volume only available if you purchased the entire series collection which came out after the first three years of the show. What a rip-off for those of us who bought the first three years only to be left without the complete collection or having to duplicate what you already own."
1,Complete release info,"Does The Timeless Media Group digitally remaster this material? Do we get 50 year old episodes taken off the air or do we start with the original tapes or media?Why are we, the consumers, constantly bombarded with these NEW releases that turn out to be very old recordings.Isn't it time that Amazon gave us all the info on new materials before trying to sell them to us?No wants to buy a pig in the poke.I can't rate it if I have more questions than answers."
5,"Peter Gunn ""Chic & Cool""","This was the only TV series my father never missed, after watchingI now know why. Good story lines, excellent actors, exceptional music,make this a quite entertaining series. Take a trip, to the time ofB&W; TV, and enjoy!"
3,"Exercises are rushed, no focus on breathing","Although the postures and exercises in this video are realistic for pregnant women, the instructor has left out important points on breath, rythym, and focus, which are not only important for yoga, but essential for labor."
3,Tough guy flick,"This is about how a guy, emerging from the murder of his own father by mafia bosses, joins a family and comes to the top leadership. It is dubbed, I think from Italian, and the production is a bit clunky, though the acting is quite good. But there is nothing in it that fascinates, beyond a story of leadership change among the sociopaths we admire. Savalas is quite good, and is the heart of the film, a likable savage who mentors the boy. His niece is also good, a soon-to-be power behind the throne who is as cold as a cobra.Recommended tepidly, as a pass time."
3,"you'll poke your eye out, kid!","A little thinner than a standard clipboard, therefore not as rigid. Great for holding a pad of paper, but it is textured from wiring, so you can't just lay a piece of paper on it and start writing without getting dimples, pits and holes poked into your paper by your pen. Has fairly sharp corners and breaks fairly easily. A fun, conversation item for the technogeek that needs a clipboard, but not the most practical model you can get."
2,Not What Is Pictured,"The package arived, its a decent clip board but it's made from cut up waffer board and is not the type shown in the photo that is made of a recycled mother board. this was very disapointing and i had opened it before realizing it wasn't the one i wanted, i will be giving this to a friend as a gift and buying the right kind"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Through The Eyes Of The Dead are one of the most talentless metalcore bands you're likely to hear. They do a bit of the generic melodic death metal riffing, with a bit of a heavier death metal sound, and a hardcore element, but they just do it all so badly, the songwriting is so amazingly weak, I don't understand why anyone would ever choose to listen to this band when there's so many similar ones around, 90% of which are significantly better. I don't know why anyone signed them. I don't know why they even bother playing music."
5,When love defeats the brumes of the deafness!,Singular and poignant story between a teacher for the hearing impaired and a deaf woman. A magnificent tribute to the originality and boldness to face such delicate and painful issue. Inspired direction and refined performances. Matlin won an Academy Award morethan deserved by her ravishing acting.Recommended without reserves.
3,ROMANTIC!,WOW THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THESE TWO WAS AMAZING IT WAS A FEEL GOOD MOVIE THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT BUT I BET U THAY DATED SOMEWHERE DOWN THE LINE IN REAL LIFE LOL!
2,Go see the play,"This is nothing like the play. The dialog in the play is so much more fun and impactful. Granted there is no pool scene in the play but it has heart. This movie is nothing like the play. They should have given it another name. I hope that someday they make a movie of Mark Medoff's play. I just found out he was partly responsible for this movie. Well, it seems to me he left out all of his funny and interesting dialog from the play. I just rewatched it hoping that the 20 years distance from when I saw the play would make this more interesting. Alas, it did not."
4,great movie..,I had to have this to my collection..great movie..I enjoyed it..had to have this!!! I could watch it over and over and again!!
3,It was ok,"I think Marlee Matlin is a very talented actress. She was great in this film. However, I thought that the film was kind of boring. There could have been a lot more of a story than their was. The whole thing about Marlee Matlin's character not talking got old after a while. If she didn't want to talk, I don't see why her boyfriend always tried to force her to. It annoyed me. So, I kind of liked this film. I would reccomend it to people who like romance, but not to people who get antsy during a boring movie."
2,Disappointing,"If you have ever bought a tape or CD of ""classical movie soundtracks"" you are more than likely to have the Bach piece from this movie on it. The music is lovely, but I think that the popularity film is only riding on the soundtrack. I would never have heard of it otherwise! Recently I got the chance to see this movie and I was eager to as I thought it must be something special. I was wrong. It started out well, and the acting was good, but by about half way it felt as though there was just nowhere to go with the story. I was getting sick of the cat-and-mouse thing between the teacher and the deaf girl. I wasn't satisfied with the ending the film had either, although I was relieved when it did come to a close. Altogether not a very interesting movie, but on other merits such as those discussed by other reviewers, such as the signing, it may have some value. For the movie-goer looking for entertainment, it offers a little but not a lot."
5,"Excellent Service... Thank You! Maurice ""Mo"" Murray",Great Movie and excellent delivery of the DVD. Thanks... MoMo MurrayJust Snap Your Fingers and...Bingo You're Sober!
5,I love this movie!,"As a hearing person, I have always want to experience in the world of deaf. This movie does benefit me a lot and make me feel close to all the deaf community. This is one of a special kind feature film I ever seen!"
5,Beautiful,"This film is beautiful. William Hurt's performance is real and a pleasure to watch. This film and Kiss of the Spider Woman are my favorite performances given by Hurt. You can truly feel for the characters during the entire film. Children of a Lesser God will not disappoint, don't miss out!"
5,Unique,"Justin's Epitome is one of our five major classical sources on Alexander the Great, but he never made it into an English translation until the publication of this book by Yardley and Heckel. That alone makes it unique.Justin's account itself is brief (about 30 pages in print) but Heckel's excellent commentary makes up the remaining 200 pages of this publication. For everyone seriously interested in Alexander Heckel's superb commentary is a 'must have'.This shouldn't be the first book you should buy about Alexander. But once you have read Bosworth, Green or Hammond, once you have tasted the original accounts of Arrian or Curtius - this is your next step on the ladder of true in dept analysis."
5,very good quality,"Good quality, and I could'nt find this shirt anywhere besides here so it was a no brainer."
1,piece missing,the adjustability of the shoe depends on being able to apply tension. the first time i wore this shoe the blue hub over the cord came off.
4,Worth the Price,"Although I've developed macros for years in MS Word, MS Excel, MS Access, and PowerPoint, this book still gave me new information and ways to accomplish tasks. The book is well worth the time to wander through. The only suggestion I have is that unless things have changed, PowerPoint has to dynamically create and assign macros to the buttons via the Auto_Open subroutine. An Add-In is created and loaded. This wonderfulness might have been briefly explained. But maybe the assumption is that folks know this already. I'm speaking from the perspective of a person who is new to PowerPoint macros."
3,Not a reference manual,Many usefull Macro's. Not a reference book though. It's more of a book of macros than a book that teaches you how to make macros.
3,OK Solutions Manual,"This solutions manual is not very accurate. It has some mistakes and it is a hassle sometimes when you're doing work.However, it is helpful because the guides do help you get through the problems you don't get. So it's a OK manual."
5,Genetics = Cake?,"It's not like I really really wanted my textbook (nobody wants to study that desperately). Thanks guys! Now I can start procrastinating without worrying about not having the book as backup the night before the test! Haha.Actually, the structure of this textbook is very well organized. The example problems are thorough and the explanations are equally well-thought-out. Combined with a reasonable lecture/prof, I think the text material is very simple and appropriate- just enough pictures and diagrams to get you by at 3AM after a few eye-burning games of DDR or whatever."
5,Nice upgrade,"I can't remember what I bought this for, but I've done front end work on my wife's 99 maxima, and my 04 RAM. All parts are by moog, and the quality is better than OEM."
5,How funny? Spit-take Funny,"Completely Brilliant! I can't remember the last time a show made me laugh out loud, often, through repeated viewings, every season. The small cast are all top notch (especially the riotously hilarious Richard Ayoade and Matt Berry- seek out their other work together)- no dead wood whatsoever. Likewise, all the episodes bear repeated viewing- there are none that I feel inclined to skip the Nth time round. Funny for anyone, but the prefect gift for the IT professional in your life."
5,Sidesplitting comedy,I love this show. This is a must see comedy. The actors are incredibly talented and they have great chemistry. Brilliant writing.
5,Great Acting and Screenwriting!!!,I love this show. I wish it was available in the States though. I watched the first two seasons of the series at a friends house. I hope I can catch season 3. :D
4,Awesome British comedy,"This show is hilarious, in large part to the diversity of the characters. The misadventures of Jan, Roy & Moss are the funniest things to come out of Britain since Spaced. I totally recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoyed the British version of the Office."
4,Great show.,"I really like this show. Along with Snuff Box, Mighty Boosh, and Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, I'd rather watch this show than a majority of the shows we have here in America (*cough* Jersey Shore *cough*)."
5,Absolutely Brilliant and well written... the funniest thing I've seen in years!!,"I was shocked and bewildered at how ridiculously funny and entertaining The IT Crowd is! I have not laughed this hard in years! I would love to find new ways to communicate just how much this show rocks, and I would love to emphasize to everyone just how much you NEED to check this show out!Stellar and amazing, The IT Crowd gets my absolute highest recommendation, and my highest rating of approval.5 stars....... Absolutely brilliant!"
5,Funniest show on TV,"No, the DVD isn't out as I write this, but I want to encourage North Americans who haven't seen the show to check it out on BBC America. This is the funniest show I've seen for years. My husband will get me this DVD for Mother's Day if he knows what's good for him. :)"
4,"Great series, poor special features","I love this series and am so happy I finally bought this on DVD. However, the special features are not nearly as entertaining as the show itself."
5,TV Series,"This sitcom is truly one of the best. If you like british humor, you will LOVE The IT Crowd. You will be hooked after the first show!"
4,Awesomely funny!,"A friend of mine turned me on to this show by showing me the pilot/1st episode on Netflix. When I saw that the actor who plays Moss was going to be in an upcoming movie, I decided to start watching the rest of the I.T. Crowd!Hilarious! Moss' mannerisms, Roy's over the top voice and reactions, and well I could honestly do without Jen... :)Well worth the buy!"
4,Must-have for 'Office Space' fanatics,"If you've (n)ever been in IT support, you've love 'The IT Crowd'. It's exactly how we all would like (or think) the IT department really (dis)functions.Makes a great geek gift."
4,"Great value, though not a 'professional' ukulele","I am a guitarist, have been for sixteen years; I wanted an inexpensive ukulele to bring with on a motorcycle trip and thought a baritone would be great, I don't have to re-learn tunings and fingering - perfect! This one was better than expected, where else can you spend $30 and get a 'playable' instrument? This thing should cost twice that for its quality. Some people complained about the uke not keeping tune - tune it, wiggle vigorously on the strings, tune it tomorrow, and in the next day or two the new strings will hold tune as good as any other. I loved this thing! Played it every day, which brings me to my one drawback: The wound strings wore out before two weeks of playing. No problem, my local guitar store stocked a high-quality set of US made strings for six bucks, and they should last much longer. So my $30 purchase truly cost me $36.Overall, very happy with this, and for the price, not afraid to take it across country by motorcycle. Perfect!"
2,I am dismayed,"I am a beginner, so I was eager to buy a quick, affordable ukulele to learn the basics on. I was fine with the idea of a somewhat low-quality ukulele as long as it lasted at least a month for me to learn what I needed. I am sad to say, it would never tune properly (although this may simply be my lack of practice)and less than a day of having it, the G string snapped. Although in the uke's defense I may have tightened it a bit too much.On brigher side, the paint job on mine was just fine. I'm going to purchase new strings for it and hope things work out."
3,Cheap is cheap,The company is great to deal with and ships in a very timely fashion. The Ukulele was only $19.00 and looks great and is fine for a small child. It is made in China and the tuning pegs are of a very cheap metal. It will not hold a tune. You have to re-tune it after every song you play which make it not a good choice for someone who plans to accompaniny their singing with a Ukulele. I recommend the company but suggest paying a little more money and getting a better Ukulele.
2,Too cheap -- find another model,"My short relationship with a Rogue baritone uke included: a) string buzz that could not be fixed and b) tuning machines that break right in your hand. I suggest you save your money and buy something a bit more expensive, perhaps a Lanikai baritone. Or a Fortune if you can find one."
5,Stunning film,"Forget all the other stuff - this is film making at its' best. Wonderfully conceived, beautifully filmed. I only wish that we had directors today that could put as much passion and story telling on the screen with such economy. Essential viewing for any student of film and any aspiring screenwriter, DP or director."
3,A startling foreshadowing,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the filmPatriotism, released as Yukoku in Japan, is film written and directed by Japanese writer Yukio Mishima.The film depicts the seppuku, or ritual suicide, of an army officer that foreshadows the real life seppuku of Mishima a decade later.All prints of the film were destroyed at the request of Mishima's widow, but the original camera negative was saved. This release is quite impressive as it is a film that quite possible would never have seen the light of day again, if not for the only existing copy being saved.This edition contains both the English and Japanese intertitled versions, plus a documentary on the film's production, and interviews with Yukio Mishima.This is a must-buy film for those interested in Japanese literature and film."
2,Book review,Found it unrealistic - no friend would want to partner for all the exercises together. Found it wafty and boring
2,Outdated and overrated.,"A bit dated and for my purpose, which was traveling from Santo Domingo to the Samana Peninsula area, it was very outdated. Not bad for a general country map but you can get almost the same map free from the rental car company {Avis in our case}. Also one side is completely blank and could have had city and/or area maps in detail.Save yourself some $$$$."
2,too much botox,"Love the idea of a women's magazine targeted at over 40 y/o. But with the number of articles and advertisements for botox and aging creams and plastic surgery and how to look and act younger; it just doesn't feel good, or like a magazine for intelligent, accomplished women - at least not ones who aren't struggling to look younger and spend yet more money on invasive procedures while subscribing to society's view of older women not counting...."
4,More or less?,"I like this magazine, but I don't feel like it has a lot of content. There were some good articles and nice features in the three issues I have read so far."
5,"New magazine to me, and worth it","I recommend this magazine, especially if you are over 50 years old. It has great ideas for women my age; I'm beyond needing hints for skinny career gals."
4,Age appropriate magazine,With all the focus on being young many trends are just not suitable for the older women.This magazine is a nice guide line so we look good and not silly.
2,Give me a break!,"Whenever I was enjoying an article about a trip or a job or a relationship it would almost invariably take a self-indulgent introspective analysis that just had me wanting to yell ""just get over yourself!"" Most articles seem to be making the point that for complete fulfillment in life the over 40 women must make at least one or more over-the-top, shocking, or dramatic change. Not all of us feel like drudges if we get along with our mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, siblings or friends or if we enjoy our sex lives or our choice of lifestyles. Lighten up! I tried repeatedly to cancel the subscription and it just wouldn't cancel. Finally, it ran out."
3,more magazine,As magazines go it's good. Some useful info and product suggestions for we mature women. good reading.
1,More Magazine,"The magazine did not catch my interest at any time when I first received it and, after a year or so, I decided to cancel. If there is a way to cancel at the More website, it is very well hidden. I don't want any money, I just don't want to receive the magazine anymore. At the bottom of the More homepage is the name ""Meredith Corporation."" At that website I was able to go to the customer service and fill in my address info and was directed to a page that allowed me to fill in info to cancel. The confirmation said to allow 7 days to upgrade my account. Hopefully that will take care of it. Just a note-many magazines pass on subscription info to a third party and that is who you have to deal with in many cases. I wanted to post this info at the More website but I would have had to open an account with a magazine I was trying to cancel in the first place. Hope Amazon allows this to be printed. Good luck to those trying to cancel."
2,More...fluff,"I found MORE to be thin, advertising-laden fluff. Many of the ads and articles concentrate on maintaining a youthful appearance and attitude. The fashion features use young models instead of fit, healthy women 45 and older. If you find encouragement and inspiration from 45+ female celebrities and want to know what clothes and makeup might make you look 24-years-old, then this is the magazine for you."
1,Conservative in disguise and more of the male-dominated views of beauty,"What a waste. I subscribed and have seen size 2 ad models, anti aging ads, 6 inch heels,weight loss crap...all the things that the patriarchal society and culture have prescribed for women forever. This magazine had an opportunity to produce classy, upbeat stories about our new image as we age, and instead it's like 17 magazine for middle-agers. Wrinkle cream, thinly veiled conservative Mommy crap..no connection with women who are childless by choice (which should be represented, as Moms absolutely should be...we make up 1/4 of couples now...). Total disappointment."
5,Will leave the reader eager for more,"Book one of the Silver Hills Trilogy, Light Of My Heart by Ginny Aiken is a soulful novel set in 1892, in the booming town of Hartville, Colorado that has sprung up next to a silver mine. Letitia Morgan is a beautiful young woman determined to practice medicine in the wild frontier land, only to find herself caught amidst potentially deadly quarrels and subject to personal attack. It will take far more than courage to prove herself and establish her career, and when the young Dr. Morgan becomes embroiled in the fate of three orphans, her life will never be the same. The first title in the ""Silver Hills"" trilogy, Ginny Aiken's Light Of My Heart offers a thoroughly compelling narrative that will leave the reader eager for more."

4,Helps tremendously,I've been using this for about 2 years and I can say this works great. My arthritis is mild in my option but the pain in some joints was terrible when I started using this it has gone away virtually all together now some days when the weather changes or it's freezing outside it can still flair a little but nothing like before I started using triple flex. I recommend it without a doubt.
5,Triple Flex is everything it says and more,"I originally got this product for my husband and it was so good he told me to try it. I did and it has worked wonders with my ""bad knees"" that they don't feel bad anymore. I can get up and down with no pain and no ""popping"" of my joints. This product is wonderful and I'm getting ready to buy some more."
1,Different product than advertised,"The product description says ""Glucosamine 1500 mg, Chondroitin 800 mg, MSM 750mg Caplets"" & ""each tablet containing 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine and 800 milligrams of chrondroitin"". I am looking at the bottle I just got, and it says each caplet contains: 750 mg of glucosamine, 145 mg of chrondroitin and NO MSM. It does, however, have 5 mg of Hyaluronic Acid per caplet. It seems to be a different product than advertised."
3,Wrong Product,"I ordered ""NatureMade TripleFlex"" Glucosamime/Chodroitin/MSN/Hyaluronic Acid two different times and both times I received something else. They sent me the NatureMade TripleFlex with glucosamine/chondroitin/MSN. They were advertizing this with the Hyaluronic Adic on thier web site (which was more expensive)but yet they did not send. [...]"
1,Beginning to Wonder If Any of These Products Work,"I've been shelling out money every couple of months now for this product and have seen no improvement whatsoever. I think this, like so many other supplements we take, are a hoax. I have been taking this for over 6 months now and my joints seem worse than before I started taking it. I have had knee xrays and have been told by 2 doctors my bones are fine. There is no arthritis or anything else going on in my joints. Needless to say, this has been another waste of my money.I have also researched glucosamine, chondroitin and MSM supplements on the internet. Studies by major universities and labs either find that there are worthless and do nothing for you or the results are inconclusive. Bottom line is, I found no research that states these supplements actually work."
3,The 'caplets' are large,"I just received these and am hopeful they will be effective... HOWEVER, FYI the 'caplets' are quite large. They are scored so I guess I will just have to cut them in half... but in my opinion, that is annoying to have to do."
3,Nature Made Triple Flex,"I'm sure the product is great, but I think have nerve damage and not joint. I'm still taking it to see if any other pain goes away"
5,IT REALLY WORKS...,"I have had chronic dull pain in my left knee for years, partly because of a old basketball injury, partly because of being over-weight, which puts pressure on one's knees and back.I have taken other products for this same problem and they worked somewhat (such as SAM-e); but this product works the best.Like it says on the box, give it 7 days to start working- it takes time to ""get into your system"". You will notice a DEFINITE difference after 10 days. I did- after about the 10th day, 70% of the pain was gone, and the knee felt more flexible, (much like when you oil a rusty hinge of a door). A knee is basically a hinge which connects your feet and legs. I am now able to do more exercise, more walking, and be more active, which is great.Easy to use: takes two pills per day- that's it. I usually take 2 pills first thing in the morning. The price is reasonable, considering the benefit it gives you.**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**"
4,5 hours of great techno,"Arround 5 hours of one of the greatest and novedous Techno event in Barcelona. Very cheap, high quality."
3,Very tedious and biased,"Durant fills the tome up with side people and issues that have little bearing or interest on the time. I think he just didn't know how to edit himself and was looking to make 'big volumes'. I have read all of the series and his earlier works up to the Renaissance, were much much better. This book is boring and I cannot understand how 4 volumes came out of the Enlightment, except this unrepetant liberal really loved Rationalism and the Napoleonic code. Unless you too are very liberal and want to view history that way pass this by. Out of the French books, Voltaire and Napoleon are the best but again no where near the intensity and interest of earlier ones."
3,Great for the need but could have been made better and safe,"This is a great enclosure for the home media wiring. This meets the needs. But it has one design flaw and a safety issue. The door is much heavier than the rest of the enclosure which compounds the safety issue. The door is connected tho the enclosure body through 6 screws, not through a hinge. It takes a few seconds to a minute to get the door hung on the top 2 screws of the enclosure and if you are not very careful then it could fall on your feet and if you are not wearing heavy shoes then the fall can seriously injure your feet. Making the door heavier will only make the injury bigger."
4,Rubber chock,The right size. Make sue to buy two. These are alot safer than what i used to use. I didnt want to spend the money at first but i am glad now
5,This Couple Shaped Church History,"Here is the journey of a man and a woman that actively put their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ during the Reformation Era.They were used by God to lead others into the practice of adult baptism. That was contrasted to infant baptism. They were called Anabaptist.This practice was violently opposed by the leaders of the church and the state.They continued amidst persecution, suffering and ending in death as martyrs for their faith.This movie makes personal and real a critical season of church history."
5,The Price of Conviction,"The Anabaptists believed that God's people were baptized by water and by fire. Most Christians are baptized by water, but few by the fire. This film will teach you how those freedoms were gained by the fires of persecution. Go back to a time when being baptized as an adult; reading the Bible; sharing Scripture; and holding divergent views from the ""official"" church were crimes punishable by the most cruel methods possible. I promise that if you are a conscientious Christian, the conviction of how much your faith means to you, will keep you from sitting passively through this film! It is an excellent film in both content and performance."
4,The Radicals,"The ""documentary"", as opposed to the feature, sufficed for my purposes, as it in actuality is a condensation of the latterand contains the crucial scenes, including the drafting of the Schleitheim Confession, although only articles 1, 6, & 7 are mentioned, and the trial, in which Sattler's memorable comments are taken verbatim from the records. A worthwhile purchase, one that provides students with illuminating insight into the beliefs and suffering of the Reformation era's most numerous victims of intolerance, at the hands of Protestants and Catholics alike."
3,Low Budget,The story was good. The history is better. I wish there was some mention of what real Biblical baptism is. A spot of language that wasn't needed. Overall a good film.
4,very good,The service from the book source was quick...I loved the video of the radicals & would highly recommend it. It's really good for preparation for our own sufferings which will take place here in our land.
2,Another foul language Christian movie,"This was a great story and it would have been one of my better DVD's in our Christian collection if it were not for the cussing. I really do not understand these film makers. For a movie like this there only audience is going to be Christians, yet they can not resist using their foul language, which limits the sale of their own product."
4,Roadsigns from the Path,"This volume is a valuable work. The first portion is the proverb of a young man seeking wealth who is lead to the proverbial benefactor of the secrets of wealth. (see also ""The 10 Secrets of Abundant..."" series by Adam Jackson - an excellent collection). Although the parable is weak in many points (concentrate on the heart of the rose?!?), there are also many powerful points that can be life changing.The second portion is a collection of tools that anyone can use to attain his or her dreams. I highly recommend this portion of the book as a continued resource on your path. The author makes several references and uses direct quotes from many excellent books to further his points, and as a reader, I felt that this gave him credibility, and an additional resource for later study.I highly recommend this quick but powerful read to anyone who is ready to take the first baby steps toward realizing their wildest and happiest dreams."
3,Something I Want to Tell You,"I bought this for one rare song, ""Something I Want to Tell You"".I'm a collector of old & rare songs, and was surprised to find that Huggy Boy had it. Most Various Artists CDs have nothing but common & trite songs, but this one added new songs to my collection. My only gripe is that CDs with only slow whiney songs bore me after a while. There needs to be some up beat songs that makes your head bob and your fingers snap. There are none here. But the one rare song I wanted made this CD worth the price."
5,"the songs are all good, and I hope Huggy Boy makes a vol.2","THE SONGS WERE ALL GOOD AND I HOPE HUGGY BOY MAKES A VOLUME 2 AND I WISH HE PUTS THE SONG 'WANT YOU AROUND"" BY KIM WESTON....THANKS AND ITS ALL ABOUT OG MOTHA FUKIN TOPPS 99 SOUTHSIDE SERRANO ST KINGPINS ......."
4,"Expensive, but good socks",These socks are working well for me so far. They keep away moisture and don't get stinky. The one negative would be that they are not as warm as I would like. They are good for slightly cold days when you are wearing pants. I wear them with sneakers and need warmer socks on colder days. They don't slip which is great. I've also washed them several times and they still look brand new.
4,Great for Light Hiking/Heavy Walking,"I actually wear these more for work than recreation. I work in a large building with miles of concrete floors and I spend most of my 10 hour work days roaming those floors. I need a more ""functional"" sock than your run-of-the-mill athletic, crew or girly sock. These fit the bill perfectly. They're thin enough to wear under casual or athletic shoes without being bulky but they are thick enough to provide a bit of extra cushioning as I stomp around all day on concrete.I knocked one star off simply because of the price. While not a bad price for this particular brand, in my mind anything above around five dollars for a single pair of socks is too high."
1,Sizes don't match,"The sizes are clearly marked inside the packaging as ""small, sizes 5 - 6.5"".The sticker the vendor put on the package, of all 8 pairs I received said ""Size 9"".So as you can imagine, they didn't fit."
5,Great Book!!!!!,"Great book!!! I loved it. It has it all: humor, mysticism, erotic romance, suspense and a really good hero!!!I can't wait for the next book!"
1,not what I espected,"Just bought it of H*** D**** and just to make it short... it is advertise as to reach up to 150 ft... lets try 50 and I'm being generous, I live in a 3 floor building on the 3rd floor. First it sounded in the apartment fine, but when I decided to go downstairs and try where it was suppose to sit, it didn't rang. The I thought well maybe it doesn't penetrates to good so I decided to bring it to the window so it will have nothing in between. (window faces towards the front where the button is to sit).So the distance is no more than 50 ft. 3 floor up and that's it, no turns no walls just the window in between them. And guess what.... Yeap... It didn't work... New Batteries and Nothing.... Hopefully this will save somebody from waisting some good American dollars on this thing..."
2,Warped portrayal of Cuban-American community,"In general this is an interesting book and it provides a partially accurate picture of many socio-cultural patterns in Miami-Dade. However, the book presents a lop-sided, biased and unfair characterization of Cuban-Americans and CANF supporters and a shallow overview of the complexities and the tragedy of the Elian Gonzolez case. The child's mother gave her life so that he could know freedom and have a better life with his Miami relatives, who sincerely loved him and cared for him as did many members of the local community. The authors chose to be selective in what facts they presented in order to portray the Cuban-American community in negative light."
4,Fascinating dissection of symbolism of fairy tales,"I enjoyed this book, for its symbolism, meanings attributed to fairy tales, psychology contained there in, etc. Gives you a new slant as to how past generations looked at life, and how they told of life, the passages everyone goes through, in fairy-tale form. Very interesting account, somewhat Freudian, but very interesting."
5,Real World at a Detached Distance,"Bettelheim discusses the particulars of many of our most treasured fairy stories (particularly the Brothers Grimm) and outlines how events in the stories do not explicitly state, but parallel the developmental stages in a child's life. Periods of human development such as toddlerhood, puberty, and young adulthood are conveyed through symbols such as colors, numbers, and animals. Bettelheim states that many fairy tales have a lesson to teach with a somewhat risque or violent story, and while acknowledging that this could make some parents uncomfortable, states that authors that have sought to temper these effects have actually ruined the teaching and palliative effects of these stories. All said, Bettelheim makes a strong case for fairy tales as teachers about life. The lessons; however, are presented in an abstract or fantasy way that allows children to detach from, and therefore externalize, their own life questions and problems."
3,Interesting but gets too Freudian,Bettelheim knows a lot and he gives interesting close readings of many tales but it gets tedious to hear about how everything turns on OEDIPAL situations and that all girls love their fathers and have to learn how to separate from them. A good place to start but there are better books out there on fairy tales.
1,THE ABUSES OF DR. B,"While this book is widely embraced by educators, psychoanalysts, children's TV programmers and others, it is important that people reading it know some background about the author, Bruno Bettelheim. I suggest you read Richard Pollak's ""The Creation of Dr. B,"" which deals with Bettelheims suspect credentials and methodology. For an even quicker primer, look at the Amazon.com on-line reviews of another Bettelheim book, ""The Empty Fortress,"" a completely discredited and misguided work that blamed autism on ""refrigerator moms"" and poor parenting, thereby setting back appropriate treatment of this condition and hurting a generation of families and children."
5,absorbing,I am a counsellor working with children. This book enables me to help children to tell their experience in story form. It is much easier for example for a child to talk about the mean witch that robbs the princess of beautiful things than attempt to say my grandmother is mean and wants the beautiful things for herself. Bruno's insightful way of linking the fairy tales with the unconscious material the child may be processing I find truly absorbing and enchanting myself.
5,"The deepest, most richly-layered poetry I have ever read.","This poetry takes some time to master, but it is well worth the effort. It recounts the rise and fall of Arthur's kingdom from the point of view of Taliessin, the court poet. The non-linear lyric pieces are a perfection of the craft; especial standouts are ""Taliessin's Song of the Unicorn,"" and ""The Queen's Servant."" Perhaps if enough people become familiar with this hard-to-find classic, it will reappear in print! All lovers of Arthuriana: this is a must.Tawny M. Goswitz"
2,Not Exactly what you see,"The quality of this comforter appeared to be excellent. However, we purchased what we thought was Black and WHITE - what we got was black and cream. We didn't even take it out of the package because it would not work for us. The quality looked to be very nice, but as previously stated, it was not black and white as it shows in the picture. Very Disappointing."
5,I love my new comforter!!!,This product is just what I was looking for. The quality is excellent and I am more than pleased with my bedroom now. I had looked everywhere for something I would be happy with and I found it!!! Well worth the money.
5,Beautiful Set!!,"The quality of this comforter set is fantastic. The fabrics are very heavy weight, upholstery grade fabrics. It's absolutely beautiful and I saved a bundle on Amazon versus buying the same item in my local department store."
4,Very nice,"This product was originally backordered, but the product came much earlier than anticipated at $100 less than other sites. The print is GORGEOUS and the white is actually white (unlike other comforters I've seen). The only gripe I have is that the fabric is a bit canvas-like so it's a little bit stiff- but not by any means scratchy or uncomfortable."
1,Not what I thought,After paying a pretty good bit of money on this bedding set I was very disappointed to find out if it even gets remotely wet the colors run and the bedding is ruined. It was raining during a move and 2 of the pillows are now black and blue instead of black and white. Really disappointing.
5,Super light and comfie panties,"I love these light-weight and almost all-cotton panties. They hold up well to repeated machine washings and drying. I wish the still came in black, put the pale pink is nice. The price was okay and the shipping was fast."
4,Cotton Brief with nylon,"This a very nice cotton/nylon brief with no support at all, very comfy but not a very thick cotton. The cotton is too thin and that's why I gave it a four................so if you just want a nice thin cotton/nylon brief this is your type of brief....its good for daily use at home."
5,Comfortable,These are quite comfortable and lightweight. The crotch is only one layer thick like all the rest so there is not as much absorbancy as with some panties. They do come completely clean on washing.
2,Worked Well Till It Died!,"We had this in our small office for a little over a year. It worked fairly well, but I wasn't super impressed. A week ago it died on us. Fortunately, the hard drive was fine, so we could take it out of the defective casing and get our data. I'm sure most devices don't die like this one, but I'm inclined to shop for a different brand."
4,does just about everything I expected,"this is the second 500GB linkstation pro i've purchased, i was happy enough with the first that a second was a no brainer. the best thing is the afp support, makes using it with my mac a lot simpler. i use the second one to backup the first, and the linkstation has a built in way to do this which i like. its fast and simple to set up."
1,Problems,"I could tell immediately when I opened the box that this purchase was a mistake. I didn't consult Amazon first; I bought one from Fry's. When installing the software, it's anything but intuitive. I still have no idea how to set up the ftp feature. And, now I'm having hardware issues like the ones mentioned in previous reviews -- the drive just disconnects from the network for no reason. I'm nipping this one in the a** and returning it immediately. One star."
4,a solid NAS drive,"For now I'm rating this with a 4 stars because I only have it for 2 weeks. If it proves to be reliable I will bump it up to 5 stars.So far so good though, I can get pretty good speed with my 100Mbps network.There are two USB ports in the back but you can't use it to connect to your computer. instead you can plug another external hard drive to it. then you can use the external usb drives for either backup or additional space. the buffalo box has built-in backup program, so you can do ""backup this directory to drive in usb port 1"". pretty slick.The box doesn't generate any noticeable noise or heat. it does get warm to touch but not as much as my iomega silver 160GB external.So far the only annoying part is the slow management interface. Probably because it has weak cpu. Most people wouldn't use the management too often, so this is only a tiny minus."
2,Buyer beware,"I've had this unit (LS-500GL) for 1 year now and there have been consistent hardware problems. The unit would power off automatically or just stop communicating on the network without any notification. A hard reset was required every 2-3 weeks. I've called Buffalo Support a number of times and besides the customary 30 minute hold, they are less than helpful. The same answer applies that there's is nothing similar reported and just do a hardware reboot.Two days ago the fan went. Buffalo will NOT replace the device unless it's been purchased less than a year ago. If it's a few days older, as in my case, you're out of luck. There is NO repair service so the unit becomes an expensive doorstop.In short, the LinkStation has been working inconsistently for a year and there is no recourse or repair whatsoever after 365 days.Use caution when considering this device or even BuffaloTech as a vendor. Product and service are sub-par on many fronts."
2,Don't believe the hype you read here.,"The reviews here largely influenced my decision to purchase this NAS, but I am very disappointed. Data transfer rates are so slow that it can't be used as a fileserver over a network. Transferring 5GB from a connected USB device to the NAS took almost an hour - and I was not accessing anything else at the time (not that I could have anyway). It is decent for the money but it appears that if you want anything close to usable performance then you'll need to pony up at least twice this for something from another manufacturer."
4,"simple to set up, easy to use","Just got this, so can't comment on reliability and longevity. However, it was easy to set up -- just plugged in an ethernet wire from my router, and it became visible on the network. It's quiet, and doesn't take up much room. Performance is decent with 100Mb network, I don't have Gigabit setup right now.I didn't bother installing their software (you don't need to if you are familiar with networked servers & storage). I was able to log in (easily) through a browser on one of my machines, make configuration changes, and make it become a member of the workgroup. Seems to work fine with XP and Vista, so far completely trouble-free.I haven't tried hanging usb drives off it yet, will do so and update this review. They also provided some backup software from Memeo that might be worth trying out.I like it enough that I'm planning to get a second one to use as a mirrored backup."
2,"Disappointed that it does not appear to work with Mac ""Time Machine"" software","I purchased this NAS drive last week with hopes to use it to backup the four Mac's I have here on my home network. All the Macs are running Mac OS X Leopard. However, out of the box it does not appear to work. I have set up the drive via the default instructions - but it is not recognized by the Time Machine software as a valid backup disk. I have also done a quick check of support forum and there may be a way to do it - but sounds complex. Looks like I may have to box it back up and return it to Amazon. Darn it! If anybody has gotten this to work, I am open to try your workaround. Not in a habit of leaving bad reviews - just disappointed since I had the illusion this stuff would work out of the box."
5,Great book! Good for beginner.,Short book that allows the beginner beekeeper to quickly find a topic with detailed information. This book will be in my library for a long time.
5,Buy the new version,"I have purchased both the version on the market now (2007), and the former model (2006). The new model is vastly improved over the old nightlight. I bought these for my son to use as a nighlight that he can carry. The 2006 version lasted only about 5 hours brand-new, and the light bulb burnt out after only a few months of use (not to mention the fact that they came apart every time they were dropped by my toddler). When going to their website to buy new lightbulbs, I discovered the 2007 version. This version seems to be more durable, and is more user-friendly. The design is almost identical from the outside, but a new bulb inside means it stays lit throughout the night (8 hours) and has a more gentle glow. I'm very pleased with the new, improved product."
2,Get the Mobi Tyke Light instead,"I have had to write to the company for a new charger twice after these lights stopped working for no reason. The Mobi light is a much better, more durable product, and the battery lasts far longer. These vessel candeloo lights are attractive but a big disappointment."
1,Maggie Wholesale 96 Pack Noodles,"Day:1 Hmm, I was excited on seeing Amzn.com's offer which pretty much dwarfs the price I pay for noodles at the Indian grocery store...when the box came, I ripped it open to taste the noodles hoping that the taste would be great... hmm not quite.. it had a stale smell, not intolerable, but recognizable.Day:2 I ate two packs and did not get the flavor... something fishy..Day:3 I decided that I am not going to return a 96 pack (rather 94 now) box and decided to stock the noodles in my shelf. Suddenly my eyes fell on the expiry date, it was February 2011.. and what date is it today? August 2011..The idea is not about being able to return products, but to make sure the products are good in the first place.. think about the effort I have to put in now to return it... why does this happen? Is Amazon not reading reviews? Are people who pack the noodles not literate enough to read the expiry date? I am disappointed."
5,different yet every bit as good,"many people will say that this book wasn't as good as the other stuff that jeph loeb has done but thats not true. people will say this because loeb has made the long halloween and the sequel dark victory which are wildly popular for their element of crime drama, they are less of comic books and more like dark mafia movie that would happen to have batman in it. however haunted knight is different, but not more like a comic book. the book explores three phycological themes and becomes less of a story heavy of plot line and character sketches but more of dreamscape that ventures through the psyche of bruce wayne. the way this story is written transcends batman and the concept of. its more the physical manifestation and illustration of the struggles of an exceptional man done very artistically. the art also transcends the style of comic book by maintaining a more sleek and flowing design that complements the story at hand."
2,Not up to par with other works,"Definitely not worth the full price. As a standalone, this isn't bad. However, if you read the Long Halloween which is a masterpiece I might add, this falls definitely short. If you absolutely must get this, please do yourself a favor and pick it up on ebay or a local comic shop if it is on sale"
3,Worth a read...,"Not really a big fan of this one. I just got done reading ""hush"" and had so much bat-fever that I picked this one up.I thought they could have done so much more. But the last 2 stories were good. The first one I could do without.Having just read hush, and falling in love with ""Lee's"" artwork seeing some of these almost Sunday morning comic strip scenes had me really bummed. The second and third story the artwork got better. Some of the lettering was really hard to put the villains voice too. Kinda felt like no emotion or just to fast.All in all I would say it's worth a read. To each his own."
3,A Good Read,"Once you pick up this book at the store you already know its going to be good because of its creators Loeb and Sale. The story line is great because it includes the villans, Joker, Scarecrow, and Mad Hatter. I like the art it is very detailed. Although I do not like the format of this book because its made out of real paper and not magazine paper like traditional comics have. But I recommend it for any Batman fan."
3,Not as good as the other Sale/Loeb,"its really good but not as good as the other two books Loeb/sale did together the its goes very deep into the mind of bruce wayne and shows us a bit more of human side to batman, buuuuut the ghost of Christmas past thing going on in the last section is a bit strange for a batman"
3,The worst of Sale/Loeb series,This was the last of the three graphic novels by Sale/Loeb that I read (the other two being Dark Victory and The Long Halloween). It added no value and was not worth reading. The major plus is the art other than that I would skip this collection.
3,"Good read, nothing special","It's composed of three stories, the stories are nothing special. They seem like just another day in the dark knight's life."
2,Jeph Loebs worse,"now im a big fan of Jeph Loeb, and the Scarecrow story in particular is great, but the rest is pretty lacking. the second story involves the Mad Hatter who is a villain with great potential but it wasn't really well done. the third story is utter nonsense, a cheap take on A Christmas Carol.the artwork i found simply ghastly. i recommend you just borrow or check out the book from a library to read the Scarcrow story ""Fears"""
3,"Not Bad, But Ultimately Unsatisfying","A very quick read, this compilation of three short Batman stories left me wanting more. Although the premise behind each story is good, there is simply not enough time and space devoted to any of the stories to explore them completely. I prefer the intricacies and depth of the longer TPB titles. Fine for a quick bat-fix, if you have an hour to spare, this book is for you."
1,Don't Bother,"The art work is okay, but not very interesting. The storylines are terrible. Not in the same league as the other two Loeb Batman graphic novels. Highly disappointing."
4,Haunted Knight: An Unexpected Treasure,"I was unfamiliar with the artists and writer of this particular book so my expectations were very low. I was pleasantly surprised when I read this and was thrilled with the amazing art and storytelling. I thought the stories {other than the final one about A Christmas Carol which was a personal story and was absolutely amazing) could have had more emotion and depth. They seemed more like ""just another Batman story."" I will be reading The Long Halloween, hopefully that book will bring about more of the horror that Halloween could really be in Gotham City."
4,The Dark Knight's Dark Holiday,"""Haunted Knight"" collects three different Batman tales by Loeb and Sale all of which focus on Halloween. It's an interesting idea. The art is a bit exaggerated as was the style in the mid 90s when these issues were first released. The insight into the character of both Batman and Bruce Wayne is excellent. So are the takes on Alfred, the Mad Hatter and the Scarecrow. Two of the stories are excellent. The last one, while interesting, falls back on one of the great cliches in popular culture as ""A Christmas Carol"" by Dickens is retold. It's a tribute to the Loeb/Sale team that this third story is not a total disaster though it is the weakest story of the three. The insights into how Bruce Wayne's private life, including charity work, his love life, even his mother's taste in books, shapes his Batman persona is thought out and well defined. This book is more treat than trick and Batman fans will love it."
4,Batman Fights Scarecrow and Mad Hatter,"The Scarecrow and Mad Hatter as real Batman villains, the way it should be! Not as filler characters as in other Halloween books like The Long Halloween and Dark Victory. Only problem is they are short stories since there are 3 stories in this book. The last story sucks so much as Bruce Wayne gets visited by spirits of his past a la A Christmas Carol."
4,Three good Batman-stories,"I like this book because there are complete stories, featuring many classic Bat-characters and depicting them just the right way. It reminds me a little the Animated Series (simple but good stories and characterization). Tim Sale's art is not as fine as in The Long Halloween but it remains very cool and it really gives an atmosphere to the book. Definitely a good reading, quite different from all the crossover-stuff and never-ending plots."
4,Classic Loeb & Sale!!,If you're looking for a straight up classic Batman book without being bogged down by continuity this is a great read. Good stuff.
2,Meh... Not their best,"I'll keep it short: this is not Loeb & Sale at their best.. I'm a fan of all their work from the Marvel color theme (Spider-Man: Blue, Hulk: Grey, Daredevil: Yellow, and that one issue of Capt. America: White), and I enjoyed both Batman: Long Halloween & Batman: Dark Victory... Even their work on the TV show Heroes was great...Haunted Knight is shallow at best. There's one scene where Gordon invites Batman to Bruce Wayne's costume party. ""You could come as you are,"" I believe is how Jim sells it... Very shallow, lacking a real grasp of any characters, relying instead on prejudices based on superficial observations.The artwork is great, though if you like Tim Sale. His work is worth the paperback price. My daughter and I plan on whiting out the text/word bubbles, and writing a more fitting story."
5,Fun and creepy,"Inspired by 3 classical stories, Batman comes across some of his most nastiest foes. The last chapter is creepy and alot like ""A Christmas Carol"". Batman fans would like this."
4,Concise and to the point,"Hennessey's book is a widely used text for anyone contemplating U.S. citizenship or preparing for a U.S Constitution exam. It offers concise explanations of U.S. history, our system of government and how it works, the Constitution, and a sampling of how state government works using California as an example. My only criticism is the author's vantage point. Why is it assumed that a citizen's primary function in our society is to engage in political activity? Nevertheless, Hennessey's book is highly recommended by this reviewer."
2,Love the toy... but it breaks very easily,"I love this toy but it breaks very easily. Within 5 minutes of removing it from the box, a link broke. I don't think I was using it in any way that was rough or unusual. The next day another piece broke off :("
3,Truly awesome toy but somewhat fragile...,"I got one of the Jr. Chrome Tangles for Christmas in 2003 and LOVED it!! This is the smaller, metal one. I kept it at work and played with it often as a stress reliever. I actually found that I couldn't put it down sometimes! After only a week of use I found the joints were becoming loose, as if they were pulling away from each other. A couple of days later one of the joints actually broke. I was very disappointed because I love this toy!! Thinking that I just got a bad one I went ahead and ordered another one. (Both were purchased from ThingGeek.com) This time I was careful to only play with it lightly, just in case. Unfortunately, after about a week this one also broke in the same manner. I would have given the Jr. Chrome Tangle 5 stars because it really is an amazing toy, however, since I have had 2 of them break I can only give it 3."
3,Fine Product - appears used,The product functions as stated and I could see it being stimulating for children. It came in a mangled box and appears used. This is happening to me more and more frequently with Amazon. I suggest using a different retailer when possible.
2,Great if it held together,I have used other tangles and love them. I thought this would be great and it was (for a day). Then it broke after a light use and needed glue. I glued it back in place and it broke in another. I am not being forceful with this thing as I have not damaged the plastic ones I have owned. This thing needs better epoxy on its joints! Spend your money on the plastic versions rather than this one.
2,"Cute kids, zero beads","I purchased this book hoping for a basic primer of the Ndebele beading technique. Talk about a misrepresentation! What I got was a charming children's book with detailed photos of the Ndebele people, mostly women and children, adorned and bedecked with beads. However, the ""craft"" is not a bead technique, it is making a poor imitation of the beautiful Ndebele dolls, using tissue paper, a toilet paper roll, glue, and sprinkled beads. If you are looking for a children's book to introduce your child to a new culture, this would be the book for you. (I gave it to a friend, and it is now one of her son's favorite books.) If you are looking for a craft book of beading techniques, don't spend your money!"
5,loved it!!,"very pleased with this set , great qualityand a great price for a whole/ i grew up watching gilligan so this is now a prized set for me"
5,My kids love it,I loved this show as a kid in the 60's and my kids love it today. Good wholesome fun compared to what's on tv these days.
3,Oh no....flipper discs!,"Normally I wouldn't pay this much money for an old TV series, especially one this silly. From a nostalgic point of view however this series is quite entertaining. It helps growing up with a crush on Ginger and Mary Ann. :-OThe audio may be mono but it sounds much better than the old transfers you heard on broadcast tv years ago.The only negative so far is the flipper discs. You should be very carefull when handling. The only discs I've ever had go bad after a couple of years were flippers."
5,Always good!,Gilligan' s Island was always a great show! The reruns always make me laugh. I wish there wasn't as required amount of words you need to write for a review.
4,Sit right back and you'll hear a tale . . .,"If you're looking for some mindless, nostalgic entertainment - this is it. This is not a show you have to think about - or analyze - in fact thinking or analyzing will just frustrate you because none of it makes sense! Just get yourself a snack, turn off your brain for 25 minutes and enjoy the crazy antics of seven stranded castaways on Gilligan's Island!"
2,Disappointed,"I am a little disappointed, when I purchased the series was because it said that as language was Spanish and English, however when I received it realized that only came in English and I was used to seeing the series with the voices in Spanish, I feel duped. It is not the same, definitively."
2,Rose colored glasses anyone?,"Gilligan's Island was a fun 1/2 hour for me when I was a kid when I came home from school, but as an adult, it is painful to watch. If you have seen one episode, you have seen them all. Each episode revolves around some outlandish plot to escape the island and is filled with the same lame pratfalls of Gilligan that lost it's charm after the virgin time.There are better tv sitcoms that deserve to be re-visited, Gilligan's Island is NOT one of them."
2,An annoyingly awful show,"I hated this show when it first aired and I still hate it today. The scripts are idiotic slapstick; the premise is absurd, the acting is annoying."
5,Great value; very happy! Recommended to all Gilligan fans.,This was the best value for the complete series; there was not a glitch in the transaction; received on time in perfect condition.
5,Gilligan's Island shows,"After watching this show as a child, it's fun watching it again as an adult with my husband. Always good for laughs at the end of the day."
4,Fun Watch,Use to watch this show when I was a kid and watching this series brings back those innocent fun child moments.
3,DVD's: Gilligan's Island - The Complete First Season,"Most of the comedy itself is clean. I never noticed as a kid that almost all the episodes deal with the same theme of trying to get off the island - the theme gets boring after a while. Unfortunately, the values that are exhibited are not moral: 1.) Mr. Howell is not faithful to his wife and is greedy 2.) Ginger & Mary Ann do not dress modestly 3.) the Professor promotes atheism through the normal macro-evolution baloney 4.) witchcraft is presented on several occasions 5.) Ginger tries to get her way by being seductive and 6.) the Skipper has a horrible temper."
1,meh,I bought this for my mom she watched one dvd and the rest skipped after that she didn't want to tell me cause she was afraid I would get mad so she dealt with it till after the fact I could of exchanged it however great if you want to watch and buy it I recommend it to anyone just if it skips send it back asap don't want or your stuck
4,Nicely done set,"Interesting how much most of us from that generation enjoyed this show, and in truth it's kind of lame. I believe it's that the show is so well cast that you just like the cast and there is something endearing about them. The product is high quality and very well done. Nice addition for those who enjoy classic television shows."
4,Gilligans Island.,"This was exactly what I was looking for. I had foot surgery and would be stuck in bed for at least one week. This dvd collection helped the time go by and took me back to my childhood. Would reccommend to anyone who likes funny, clean t.v. shows."
5,Gilligan's Island complete series,"I ordered the complete series for my partner, who still LOVES Gilligan after all these years. The DVD's are of course crisp and clear, and the extras with Sherwood Schwartz are great!"
5,A great nostalgic trip on DVD,"If you're a fan of the 1960's Gilligan's Island TV show, this is a great nostalgic trip with the Minnow's castaways on DVD. So sad the anticipated 4th season of the show was cancelled. Buy it, you won't regret it."
5,AWESOME!!!,"I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED TO SEE ALL THESE GREAT OLD SHOWS COMING IN COMPLETE SERIES. YOU CAN SAVE ALOT OF MONEY BUYING IT THIS WAY VERSES BUYING EACH INDIVIDUALLY. I ENDED UP BUYING GILLIGANS ISLAND INDIVIDUALLY BECAUSE I JUST COULDNT WAIT FOR THE SERIES TO BE RELEASED, BUT ITS WONDERFUL, I OWN ALL THE OLD SHOWS AND I TELL YOU, THESE ARE A MUST CONSIDERING ALL THE CRAP SHOWS THEY AIR TODAY!!!!!"
4,Awsome Set,"This is the best set of DVDs I've ever purchased. I grew up with this type of program. I do recommend for you to purchase it, specially from Amazon.com for fast delivery.The only thing I wish it had is Widescreen, which it does'nt come with. It comes in Standard format."
3,Gilligans Island TV from Amazon,"I enjoy these old TV programs and this one was one of our must see programs, so I was happy to see this offered as a free offer as part of my Prime program.However, I was trying this on my smart phone (Samsung S3) and it showed free but then I was charged for this. Lesson learned, don't trust the ""free"" offers. Perhaps this was just a glitch because I streamed it via my phone and it's HDMI connection to the TV but I am reluctant to try this again."
4,Gilligan's Island The Complete Series Collection,The package arrived very quickly and I was informed from Amazon frequently about the process of my purchase. The only thing I was not pleased with was that I thought I ordered the Complete Series when in fact it is just the first 4 complete seasons. My kids really enjoy it though so I guess I will be looking for the remaining seasons.
5,Great seller,"This product came in great condition (no shipping ""bruises"") and the seller wrote me a note within 24 hours of my order. The gracious note let me know they sincerely appreciated my order and were on top of it. That was especially helpful, as I needed it for a Christmas gift.I've watched every Gilligan's Island show so I have no doubt this series will be well loved by my sister. I'm glad it was available for sale!"
4,For good old laughs,"Brings back good memories, the videos arrived on time and in good order, better price then I could get else where"
3,Gilligans Island,"content of the series is great, however we experienced stalls and skipping on a couple of the disks. quality was a bit disappointing."
5,My boys love it...,"I had ordered this for my Husband for his b-day. Both of us grew up with Gilligans Island and wanted to show our 2 boys(age 9 and 6) what we used to watch. With so much ""stuff"" out there now for kids to watch, most of it is really not good. They absolutely love it. Every Sunday we enjoy movie afternoon and pop in a Gilligans Island DVD. And we will be bringing them camping with us also.. Thanks for a great family fun time.."
4,Gilligans Island,"The entire process of ordering was quick and easy. The only thing I would have prefered differently is the origianal packaging by the company that distributes the DVD's . I prefer the ""book-like' way to keep my DVD's than the ""snap-in"""
3,"Rating, not the fault of the store","Tried to relive the childhood, but a terrible series. Came on time, perfect condition. The show is almost unwatchable, with the exception of Mary-Ann. :)"
5,Best price there is!!!!!!,I chose the rating of five stars simply because this was the very best price that I found for the complete series.Don't think you will find anything better anywhere else.Quality is tops.
5,Classic TV's Best,"Gilligan's Island is a hilarious show, you can't go wrong with it. The plot of the individual episodes is ridiculous and nonsensical, but still entertaining and enjoyable. The humor is mostly revolved around how Gilligan's an idiot and constantly screwing up whatever of the group attempts to do, though it never really gets stale. I highly recommend the show as its always been of my favorites."
4,Fun Stuff,"This is a good collection at a great price. One downfall of the low price is that it has not been upgraded in any way from the previous season by season sets. An example - The menus on season one say ""more episodes on side 2 of disc.""Not that big of a deal of course.Glad to have the entire series in one set."
5,Gilligan'S Island,We laughed a lot and enjoyed watching a show that was filled with no bad language but just good clean fun.
4,Very funny show even funnier now than then.,"This long awaited DVD release is long overdue. Hopefully they will be quick in releasing seasons 2 and 3 and the other two movies not currently available.This set of 3 double sided discs is a great bargin and spacesaver than if it were on 6 single sided discs.Some of the humor is even funnier now than it was when first released. For example, Ginger mentions numerous times that she has a crush on actor Rock Hudson. (If she only knew!)There are some good special features but one drawback. Though the first season episodes originally aired in black and white, I have seen the same first season episodes on TV in really good colorized versions. I was hoping that they would offer colorized versions also but that does not seem likely. Seasons 2 and 3 did air in color though and will certainly buy those too.I am not a major fan of the show but will watch it if it is on. This show is a great comedy and the humor is VERY clean by today's standards."
4,Funny,"Many of those who loved the ""Gilligan's Island"", ""I dream of Jeannie"", ""Bewitched"", ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens).I wish these wonderful old TV series and many others like ""Yancy Derringer"", ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance), ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" would finally be released on DVD.The Baby Boomers would be more than happy about it!!!"
1,Rip off,"Do not buy this box set, buy the individual seasons and save enough money for a tank or two of gas. I paid $72.99 one day, the next day the price went up to $111 and then not 30 mins later it was $102. You can buy the 3 individual seasons for $15 all day long. $45 vs $102 for the same content is a no brainer.BTW, season 2 has two disc 3's and no disc 1. This has happened to me twice. Also, Amazon has a super return policy. I received my replacement set before I could get the second set in the mail. So, Warner Bros gets 1 star and Amazon gets 5."
1,Season 1,"While I love this series, I could not get it to stream to my Roku, my LG, Samsung or Sony tvs/blueray players. The only thing it would stream to is my computer. I DONT WANT TO WATCH IT SITTING INFRONT OF A COMPUTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of my favorite TV shows of all time,Gilligan is amazingly witty with the one liners that are more thought out than some give him credit for. Being free to watch made the Amazon Prime membership more valuable to me then the free shipping. Having watched Gilligan when it was on Saturday night at 8PM as a kid takes me back to a less hectic time in my mind.
5,Good TV!,"always been a fan of the show , brings me back to my childhood and my kids also love it. its good quality TV!"
5,Great!,I love Gilligan's Island and I haven't seen it on TV anymore. I saw this and had to get it. I bought it for my Mom for Christmas and we all love it. It has every episode on it and some special stuff too! We have all enjoyed watching these episodes again. I would recommend this for any Gilligan's Island fan! It is fantastic!
5,Gilligan's Island - Complete Series Collection,"This collection brought back so many memories. I'm glad my 1 and 3 year old daughters are able to watch some of the shows I watched as a child - especially Gilligan's Island - and without commercials! The bonus material is excellent, I especially loved watching the pilot I had heard about and had never seen. For those who loved Gilligan's Island - this is the way to go, the whole series in one package!"
4,Too funny...,"Even better than watching it in syndication while I was growing up...no commercials, and I pick when and which episode(s) to watch. I have introduced my children to Gilligan's Island, and they love it!"
3,This thing smells.. needs a washing when you first get it.,This thing is stinky and gets hard as a rock if you dont keep it moist like the package says but if you let it get wet again it will get pliable.
5,One of the very best biographies,"There are a handful of biographies that simply stand apart from the crowd as true masterworks; this is one of them. Massie captures the essence of Peter the Great, engagingly telling the story from Peter's childhood so we can understand the psychological forces that pushed and pulled on the man.In addition to revealing the man the was Peter the Great, Massie captures the age in which Peter lived, illuminating for the reader many of the characters that defined the age in Europe including Augustus II, King of Poland and Frederick Wilhelm I, King of Prussia. In particular, Massie focuses on Charles XII of Sweden, and Peter's arch-rival to the extent that the book almost serves as a dual biography.Fantastic stuff - highly recommended."
5,Massie's insight into Russian history is remarkable,"""A foreigner cannot begin to understand and comprehend the mysterious soul of Russian people""--was the official dogma of the Soviet history and of Soviet Intellectuals. ""Read Tolstoy, Turgenev, and Dostoevkiy to get a glimpse...""--my teachers said. Well I say, read Massie's ""Peter the Great"". He dispells that myth. His insight into the customs and history of Russia is remarkable. (For example, nowhere in ""War and Peace"" will you find an explanation of inherent Russian alcoholism problem that dates back centuries). The author manages to give detailed account of the life of one of the most influential figures in Russian history in a way that reads like a novel, and yet when you are finished you know you have read a scholarly work."
4,Peter the Great was amazing,"This is a long and interesting book. It not only covers the life of Peter, but there are sections about Sweden, France, Holland and many of the countries that Peter had an association with. I'm still slogging through it due to the the amazing amount of detail. Massie writes a 'reader friendly' kind of book. I also like Catherine the Great by him."
4,Great Book but the Paperback Version weighs over 2 lbs - get it on Kindle!!!!!,"I recently purchased Peter the Great in the paperback version. I had no idea it was so heavy - weight is not listed for books on Amazon. The paperback book weighed over 2 lbs.! At over 900 pages, I will not read it in just a few days and I wanted to be able to take it with me on vacation. So I purchased it for my Kindle instead.That being said, Massie has crafted a fascinating read that extends well beyond the confines of 18th century Russia into all of Europe. He interweaves details that transport the reader into the life of those times. Although accurate, this does not read like a history book - more like a beautifully written novel.I have not yet finished this book but I will hate to see it end."
4,One Hell Of A Book,"This is an exhaustive biography and a great read. My only complaint is that it gets bogged down with too much detail about battle plans and military strategy. Many readers will like this, but I'm not one who reads history to memorize numbers of cavalry, troop movements, etc. Its not a fault of the book, but if I had known I would have to devote so much time to things that don't really interest me, I would not have started reading it. However, I did finish the book because Peter the Great is such a fascinating subject."
5,excellent book,"well written and very readable. I almost never read historical novels, but I wanted a background in Russian history before I travel to the country this summer. I find it very interesting."
4,History the way I would have want it on school,"Great book.It contains the important facts and just the right amount of anecdotes to remember them.Suppositions are clearly written as such, with different opinions provided."
5,THE GOLD STANDARD,"The standard against which ALL books should be measured. So well written, most other books pale by comparison. Paints a wonderfully rich and complete picture of Peter and his Russian empire. This book has everything; description, analysis, drama, and history. My life is richer for having read it."
5,"You will enjoy this book, and thank the Lord that you live in the 21st century","If you like history and biography you will love Peter the Great, but you have to like history a lot because this book is 855 jam packed pages. Here you will learn everything you ever wanted to know about Russian history from about 1680 to 1725, along with ample pieces of European life during the same period. Massie is a fascinating writer and produces a biography that reads like a novel. You will enjoy this book, and thank the Lord that you live in the 21st century."
3,Peter the Great,"This is well written and carries the reader along. It is not just about Peter the Great, but tells a lot about what was happening in Europe at the same time. I was a little frustrated that we didn't learn more about what was happening in Russia during all those years when Peter was off learning shipbuilding, making war, laying siege....I wanted to know how the Russian people were faring during all that time. I would have been willing to sacrifice one or two of the detailed descriptions of military campaigns (each wall scaled) to have this. Still, I enjoyed the book, learned a lot, and would recommend this book to anyone who had time to read 880 pages!"
5,Purchase and Book Review,"For a penny, who could go wrong. As to the book, it is akin to ""Love and War"" a very long novel in small print. What does this give you ..... a detailed look into the life of a man who brought Russia out of ""the dark ages"" by bringing Western Influences and culture to Russia.The book is a long read .... heck I haven't got much past ""The Great Embassy"" but it is very interesting how Peter the Great shunned pomp and prestiege. The book details how, as a young child, after the death of his family he feared for his life while awaiting to be selected as a ""dual Tsar"" with his older half-brother. How he battled the political scene until his brother died and he became the sole Tsar.This book was/is especially interesting as my wife and I were going/have gone on a trip ""Waterways of the Tsars"" down the Vogal River from Moscow to St Petersberg. The book gave insight and better meaning to the trip."
5,Superb,"This is one of the finest books in the English language. Massey details the life of one of history's most magnificent characters in a thoroughly readable narrative. From spectacular anecdotes about the eccentric Tsar's personal life to an inspiring account of Peter the Great's domestic and foreign political achievements this splendid tome keeps the reader entertained from cover to cover. There is certainly a bias running through the book, in particular when addressing the rather dubious demise of Peter's son, Alexei. However, we can certainly forgive Massey for this, as for what we lose in Massey's rather forgiving analysis of some of the darker aspects of Peter's character, we amply gain from Massey's ability to delicately craft the complex personality of the man. The reader is left awestruck and inspired."
5,A brilliantly written biography,"Massie has written THE definitive biography on Russia's most influential and important Czar, Peter I. The story of his life reads like fiction, although it is all true: escaping a palace revolt as a child, learning several trades in order to better understand the work, traveling abroad, building a new capital for the Russian empire, modernizing the Russian army, streamlining the Russian beauracracy, expanding the Russian empire's borders, ""westernizing"" Russia.This laundry list of accopmplishments and changes are highlighted by Massies lucid and vivid writing, making Peter a flesh and blood ruler - a person with passion and temper, intelligence and a sense of humor. The scholarship is first rate, adding to the strength of the book. I highly recommend it, not only as a biography or history, but as simply good writing."
5,The Russian legend,"This is a well-written book that tells the story of the legendary Russian Czar and an era in ways that few other books have been able to door. It is written with a deep appreciation of facts and flows smoothly.Peter The Great's personality is well describes, his travels well told, his goals well articulated and the challenges he faced trying to realize them well exposed. I ended up knowing more about Russia,its history, culture and mind set in ways that I never imagined before and set me on the path of looking for other works that explain Russia to a foreigner better. It led me to The Union Moujik,The Master and the Marguarita. What we see as divisions in Russia today, or the broader Eastern Slavs are well explained."
2,Peter the Great,I expect to get this book as I saw it to be sold with nice paper cover and nice picture on it.When I get it - it was hard cover only. Paper cover was lost or just didn't exist as shown on a website.
1,no use for it,Not as described.Thought would be able to use for teaching defensive driving here in Georgia but not able to use.
4,Fun reading for boys of all ages,My husband and son (age 5) read these books together. They both laugh and have a good time. I'm happy that there's a series of books available that interests them both.
3,Kids love it. Parents hate it,"My kids LOVE Captain Underpants, but I've found out the hard way that they don't make for very good read-aloud, bed time books. Be warned : These books are set up in comic strip form on a lot of their pages and without showing your kids EVERY page of the book while reading it, they'll be lost in the story. They're really good books, don't get me wrong, just not very good read-aloud book unless you are sitting in a circle or prepared to do the 'finger under the word as you read' type thing. My four and six year old LOVE them though. The woopie cushion that came with the box set popped in like 2 minutes. I was heart broken, let me tell ya. :)"
1,Vulgar and silly,"I must say that I bought the book after it was recommended by another mom. My children found the whole premise silly and the whole concept vulgar. I must tend to agree. There is wonderful children's lit being written today. Why does it have to be this? Underpants, obnoxious behavior, smart alecky remarks and bad manners are not what I expected. My two children rejected it as soon as they put it down. We opted for throwing it out. I know many people enjoy it but this family did not."
5,A wonderful and concise textbook on the subject...,"A wonderful introduction to Christian Spirituality, McGrath, as usual, is able to cover a large amount of information in a way that is simple to read and fairly easy to understand, even if one is completely unfamiliar with the subject. He also is careful to remain fairly ecumenical in his approach, covering the relevance and practice of spirituality in all the major branches of the Christian Faith. Having read MANY of his textbooks, I must say that this one is probably (with the possible exception of ""Foundations of Dialogue in Science and Religion"") his best yet."
5,movies,it was the best thiller i have saw yet.a 5 star movie must see.i like the robber up against the killer thats what makes this a great movie but the best5 star horror i ever saw that i wish they would make a part 2 to is dead mary.
4,THE BOX OR WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER 1?,"Arkin (Josh Stewart) who looks too much like Sean Penn is an ex-con, handy man, second story man, and a safe cracker who loves his 8 year old daughter. His ex-wife needs money ASAP so he opts to rob a place he has been casing as the family has gone away on this dark and stormy night...but wait! There is someone else in the house and Arkin is locked in as he realizes the family never left and are part of an elaborate torture. Arkin finds out the hard way that the whole house is rigged with debilitating traps and trip wires, something that would make Caulley McCulkin green with envy.Lots of blood. Good suspense. Good use of soundtrack. If you like Saw, then see this.F-bomb, sex, nudity (Madeline Zima + strip club) torture"
4,Home is not as safe as you thought!,"The Collector is a classic example of what a horror/suspense movie should be. This movie is much more than your typical slasher flick. The Collector is not necessarily scary but it will keep you very tense.Take you typical cat burglar, now give him expert craftiness at setting sadistic traps and a cold, ruthless lust for blood and you have your antagonist. He never even whispers a word but emits animalistic sounds of rage and pain that would loose the bowls of the most stout-hearted man. However, I did wonder how he had the time to set up all his elaborate traps.The backstory is weak and there are a few arbitrary characters but the core of the story is solid.After watching this movie don't be surprised if you find yourself double and triple-checking your home security system every evening!Every horror fan will enjoy The Collector."
1,Waste of time and money,"Poor acting, poor directing as the horror effects were mediocre and the sequence of the events were kind of slow and boring.To be extremely honest I didn't complete it because it was that boring and dull."
4,JigSaw on the Loose,"When you see this film you think of Saw due to all the gadgets, traps etc. All windows and doors sealed shut, you're trapped inside trying to save people but one false move can cost you a body part (if you're lucky)A thrilling movie and I see a part 2 in the works."
5,Awesome Movie,I was very pleased with this movie! I cannot believe it didn't get all the hype that the last two years of crap has..Paranormal Bore...The only ones who seem to be giving it a bad rating are bookworms or ppl who did not understand the ending. Please do not pay attention to the negatives. You have to see it! Own it ! Trust me if you like horror flicks with a mean twist you will not be disappointed!
3,'Saw' Meets 'Home Alone',"When this film first came out in theaters in limited release last year, I dismissed it as just another sub-par release in the 'torture/porn' genre. However, after a friend recommended it, I recently rented the DVD and was surprised at how well this new horror entry was done. I don't want to include any spoliers here but if you put 'Saw' in a blender with a copy of 'Home Alone', this is the bizarre concoction you would come up with. Just don't think about the circumstances in the film too long or most of it will begin to not make too much sense. Much better directed than the genre deserves and worth a look."
2,More Torture porn,"I like a good slasher movie as much as the next guy but when you don't have a very good plot and you start focusing more on the torture of people, then you lose me. Yeah, there are some good shocks in this one but my idea of entertainment is not seeing someones lips sewn together or seeing someone mutilated....on screenThese guys took the Saw formula and went with it and they need to take some script writing classes."
5,loved it,"This movie is very well made. The atmosphere is excellent, its super creepy as a horror slasher flick should be, the effects are awesome and the story is well played out and leaves in open in a great way for a sequel the likes of Halloween II. Very pleased and look forward to part 2."
3,OVER THE TOP HORROR,"THE COLLECTOR takes SAW to new levels of torture horror. It's a well made albeit disturbing film. Filled with grotesque traps and pervasive violence, it's not easy to watch. Josh Stewart is intensely effective in his role of the down on his luck jewel thief with good support from Andrea Roth and Michael Reilly Burke. My main problem is the plot holes:HOW DID THE COLLECTOR HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO SET ALL THE TRAPS?WHY DIDN'T THE GUARD DOG ATTACK THE COLLECTOR?WHY DIDN'T THE FAMILY GO ON THEIR VACATION?WAS THE COLLECTOR REALLY AN EXTERMINATOR? HE PEELED THE LOGO OFF HIS VAN AT THE END.HOW DID HE CHOOSE HIS VICTIMS--AND WHY?Not for the squeamish, but certainly horrifying."
2,:(,"I rented this movie, along with alot of others, and i was kind of in a rush to return them, so i had to watch this one, in a rush, so i don't know if that is what not making me like this film, or what. But, Evrything was too fast paced, and alot of things didn't make sense. I Think i will stick with my B Movies :)"
2,The Collector,"I saw this film at the theater. A BIG let down. Completely predictable, and the plot doesn't make much sense considering the time-frame in which all of the things in the film took place. This film might be scary/spooky if you just started watching scary movies or you are a child. At least I only spent $4 on it."
1,The Pollector,"Americans, dumb teens and all around sadists are the only ones who probably will ""enjoy"" this mindless pile of dung.Yes, this film is pretty inadequate. This torture nut wasn't a ""collector"" of humans; all he did was mutilate them to death. The plot is so paper thin, however, that having an execrable torture killer is rendered virtually meaningless. Well, he had some pretty insufferable special traps all over the house and tortures the family throughout the film.The film is not scary, in fact it's laughable at points. If you ONLY want to see torture with zero atmosphere, suspense, or true scares then go for it.It's extremely sadistic and gruesome. It's rubbish like this that does a disservice to the genre."
5,A Horror Buff's Delight!!!,"One of the best horror movies I have seen in a loooooong time!! And thats saying a lot coming from a horror fanatic like myself. The Collector is gritty, original, and an edge of your seat thriller. Taking it back to the Hitchcock days, theres an excellent use of noises and music to build up emotions and the very small script make it even more unique. Great ending. I loooooooooooooooooved this movie! Its one of those movies that will stay with you forever and you dont want to see alone!!"
5,Action intensive - surprise ending!,"Far better than many of the other horror films out there, ""The Collector"" depends more on action and creepiness/surprise/shock than being dialogue intensive. I thought I had the ending figured out, but, no, the filmmakers threw in a surprise!Only downside: another film that had absolutely no reason to include tobacco drug use, but did, anyway."
3,The original was better.,"If you're expecting a re-make of the '65' movie you'll be dissapointed.However if want blood and gore this has it by the gallons.Very slow to start but once the blood starts, it doesn't let up."
5,good movie,I had it and needed another. Very good keep you one the edge. very scary. what else can I say
5,Amazing,"I bought this because I am a huge fan of Charmed. I love it. I still have it with the rest of my Charmed things unopened because these are really rare to find and I don't want anything to happen to it, but if you loved Charmed or you are a hardcore fan of Charmed like I am. You will love this game, if you get the chance to find it. Like I said it's really really rare to find this game on Amazon in english."
2,Bored me to tears,"I think everyone who knows me know that I love history. Even so, this book was one of the most dry, tedious things that I have ever read. This book exhibits exactly what the problem is with the way that history is taught in schools today. It was page after page of unpronounceable names, meaningless dates, and useless terminology. There was not even the slightest attempt at making history a continuous flow, connecting the dots or making it interesting with narrative. In addition, the author seemed to focus the most extensively on the most complex and boring aspects of history such as economics and population numbers. Mind-numbing. The only reason it gets even two stars is because it contains some good material that I can use as a reference later when bare facts and figures are needed. Lots of information; no presentation."
3,Was to be my greatest toy ever...,"...until my computer needed to be repaired and I now have windows XP Pro on it. Does the DMM software work now?Fuggehdaboudit!!!Also a slight power surge in the house, wiped out all my tracks - so what do have to replace those track with - NOTHIN, the application will not open!!! I am heartbroken, because this was a pretty cool device. I really bought it because of the direct recording of analog sources! YAAY - a way to preserve my wax tracks, but ...alas. I have to do some research on more mp3 players righ now. Thank goodness I had a replacement plan where I purchased it! Too bad Philips."
1,Hmm not sure yet,Well I got mine a couple of days ago really eager to use it software seems ok my problem is even though the player is attached to the computer and my computer recognizes that something is plugged in the software does not permit me to copy music over. I called Philips and they said they'd get a tech to call me within 24 hours since it's easter I'll give them some time but otherwise gonna return it.
4,WoW better than i expected.,i recieved my hdd120 about a week ago. i only have a few complaintsPROSblack and white backlightsuper scroll (awesome)easy to use interfaceinline headphone controlsCONSheadphones kinda hurt...just slide them into the earon/off button is the play/pause button --> kinda awkward but ull get use to itprotective case is sort of cheapoverall this is a GREAT PLAYER AND A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO THE IPOD
2,complaint confirmation,"This device looks so cool, but the software works so suck. I couldn't agree more with the 1 or 2 star rated. I got pretty much the same problems. the file transfering and the software is so outdated and awkward!!! awkkkk... It takes too long to launch the library before you can transfer files. it stucks and closes the process as soon as it hits certain files. You have to remove that file first and start it over. It such a waste of time. I personally have seen so many problems from Phillips products. Are they going to improve their credibility or what...!!???"
1,It was a good year.. not really,"I've had this for over a year and it's finally died on me.Problems I've suffered through include the previously mentioned crap software, a period of lockup (only once) where I had to let the battery die and it worked again, and the device being way too quiet for my taste.Browsing through the player's library has always been a pain, but now the library has stopped updating. In other words, I add tracks, and they do transfer onto the device, but the device doesn't see them. I know they're there because I can look at the files via Windows Explorer. But they're not there if I try to access them on the device itself. So basically I'm stuck with what's on it, and it's only 56% full.I'm going to do some research and buy an ipod or something else. Then, since it's too late to get my money back, I'm going to smash this into pieces and never buy Philips again. A $250 lesson learned."
2,No Help Fron Philips,"The Philips 20 GB Jukebox is great if you can get your music on it.The software you have to use crashes nearly everytime you start it. If you are lucky enough to get into the software you might have a few minutes to put music on the player before it crashes again.[...]The player looks and sounds great, but the software is a nightmare [...]"
3,Glitches,"I mulled over a jukebox for a while and finally settled on this. The product is greatlooking, but the software belongs to a former decade. It does have a major downturn which no one has mentioned it is not skip resistant, so if you jog forget it. Overall looks great, but needs serious improvement on many of its features. And there is a way to upload to your computer all your playable songs, but I can't tell because I respect copyright. JAJAJA. It is pretty easy though, just think...."
5,Used this unit in the field for a year now.,"I have used this tool for over a year now. Here is Florida there are many construction jobs that require remodeling of older homes. This tool has been used in houses that still have the wire mesh and concrete, generally known as ""dry wall"". Metal casings in doors and between studs present no problem for this tool in boring holes for wire chases in walls.Note: this is a specialized tool and not for a homeowner or light repair work around the house. The weight alone is enough to give a full grown man a work out but will tackle any construction job with ease.The Milwaukee 28 volt series has, steadily, replaced my corded tools from the late 60's and this right angle drill is no exception!"
3,An olide but goodie,"I love how this review asks if I am older than 13. If you are buying the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Players Handbook, you must be over 13. It certainly brings back memories of exploring entirely new worlds. Of course, it is a geek-fest, but so what? Only a mega-geek could come up with the stuff in here."
5,A well documented and interesting research !,"Still's book will provide the reader with a thorough educational view of the history of money, the birth of the Federal Reserve bank, and the beginning of the privatization of the United Stated financial and political institutions. This is not a book about conspiracy, but a book about facts and the legitimization process of the elitist power.It's an expose worth buying and reading..."
4,Low Fat Cooking Should Not Be so Hard,"There were a wide variety of recipes in this book. I have enjoyed everyone I tried. My only comment would be that many of these recipes were time consuming and used a lot of dishes. However, the end result is worth the work provided you have the time."
5,A 'Must Read' for Spiritual Seekers!,"This book is a springboard for me to discover my God in new and surprisingly special ways. I have been blessed by the author's profound insights into ways God is present in 'ordinary' relationships and encounters. I have gifted six friends with copies of this book. For me to read this book is to have my whole self rearranged as I meet my God. Thank you, Kevin Anderson!!"
2,Note the running time--7 minutes!!,"Make sure you pay more attention to the running time than I did. I paid $2 for 7 minutes of a cartoon! The word 'episode' implies at least 23 minutes of showtime. I am disappointed that they did not combine several 'episodes' to make this a more realistic purchase. The quality was good, however, and it downloaded right away to my tivo."
4,New edition available,"A new edition of this book is available from Springer now, for a lower list price (and one third off if you have ever published in a Springer publication, like LNCS, LNM etc.)."
3,large cardinals,If you have background in set theory the book is ok if not then it's difficult reading
3,Interesting but too much reading,"Assumes set theory through forcing and some model theory. He integrates a lot of historical information which is interesting but greatly adds to the reading without adding to the mathematical understanding. The semester is short and I want to learn what I need and get on with life. While it does have more details than Jech, I like Jech's style better and not just because it is shorter. (The 2e is just a corrected reprint of 1e.)"
5,Excellent product,"This shampoo is great if you have very hard water. I noticed a huge difference. I will use this stuff forever. My hair is finally looking the way it is supposed to. It is also a good idea to get a shower filter to make your water soft to make your hair softer. Also, this product smells wonderful. It lathers great and has a great texture. Love this stuff."
1,Nothing to write home about,"In a nut-shell, I was hoping to find a product to get rid of build up on my hair and GENTLY strip away that grime weighing down my hair. Oh, it got rid of the build-up alright, but then it went on to strip my hair of any body, shine, softness or life in it. I had to use and intensive hot oil conditioner on my hair for a week to get it to look at least presentable.I was very disappointed by how harshly it treated my hair. It was dumped ASAP."
5,A Godsend for Horribly Tangled Hair,My daughters have fine hair that tangles HORRIBLY. We live in South-Central Texas and the water is off the charts hard....I have tried sooo many detanglers to try to help (Miracle Sprouts Detangler was horrible). After a vacation where softwater was the norm we realized their hair was much more manageable and finally realized that our hard water was the enemy. I bought this product and it has made a HUGE difference. I've tried using other clarifying shampoos here and there but they just aren't as good. This is also sulfate free so it is gentle on the hair. I use this about 5 times a week and switch it up with a moisturizing shampoo/conditioner on the other days.On a side note....I buy this product much less expensively from a popular auction website (come on..you know which one).
4,"Nicole, California","I just got this product and it works well for my hair. The water I use is hard, and this shampoo helps to keep my hair managable. The smell is not perfumed and feels natural."
4,It isn't for everyone--but I love it,"I really enjoy this game. But I must say, not everyone does. If you're conflict-avoidant--play something else. If you need to agree with the people around you at all times...stick with Monopoly or something. For me--and my one daughter who loves to argue, and is majoring in philosophy for what that's worth--this game is a really fun way to spend an evening, without feeling at all that you've just been passing time, but rather, stimulating your thinking, getting to know yourself and your own thoughts and beliefs better (maybe reconsidering some of them; clarifying and getting firmer in others), and really getting to know the other people you're with. What could be better than that?"
1,Ken,"Sweet, but almost no rhubard flavor. Bargain supermarket brands have more flavor. I will not be buying this product again. I will not be buying this product again."
5,"Unique, Excellent, Raw, Instructional!","Warning: Explicitly Raw!This is Rudy Ray Moore at his best, because it isn't live, is explicit, and because the listener gets to hear Mr. Moore in a more thoughtful and serious manner.I am an avid reader of astrological profiles. I highly recommend this for the oral, astrological breakdowns of male and female sexuality, which is very difficult to find, if any others exists.BUY THIS, it is difficult to get on cassette."
4,its good,"i am listening to the cd right now. it is wonderful! the sound is that great punk sound, so sloppy, crude, and fun - much like the pistols or ny dolls. if you like punk, this is a great obscure find - the kind of group that shows a 'sophisticated' punk taste. the two studio singles are wonderful, the live stuff is ok but the version of 'Class War' is pretty bad. but so what? If you like the overall sound of early punk and appreciate the place of the dils in punk history you won't care really."
3,A so so showing from a rather talent artist.,"This CD is not bad for what it is, but I think it could have been much better. I am unsure if this is just some lazy choices on Mraz's part or if the producers had to much say or something else entirely. What I do know is this CD lacked that certain feeling that is a Jason Mraz musical outing.I think the perfect example, and my biggest disappointment, would be Rainbow Connection. I've heard Mraz do an excellent rendition of this song on acoustic guitar. On this album we are given a plodding, quasi-jazz piano piece that would leave Kermit (and possibly Rolf) more than a little disappointed."
1,Stay Away!,"Stay away from this treadmill! Once I unpackaged this treadmill and put it in my basement I noticed that while the incline setting was at 0, there was still an incline to the treadmill. I contacted Lifespan about this and they said that this model of treadmill comes with a default incline even though the setting is at 0. WHAT????? Are you joking? That's what the incline mechanism is for! They said to unscrew the feet in the back of the the treadmill in order to get it level. OK, even though I should have returned the treadmill on the spot I decided to humor them and try to deploy the feet. This did not solve the issue either because THE FEET WOULDN'T UNSCREW FAR ENOUGH TO GET IT LEVEL!!!!!! The documentation that came with the treadmill did not mention any of this, neither did their website. For $2500 bucks this treadmill was a huge disappointment and I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,An amateur production,"This video was a disappointment, because someone just set up a camera and let it run. They did not even have a good spot for viewing! A barn raising is a wonderful community enterprise, and deserves careful documentation. I do hope that someone will be inspired by this video to make a much better one, showing all the steps, complete with closeups, and not waste our time watching time go by."
5,A pioneering work on American management,"I heard about this book when I was a teen. One of my older brothers spoke about it with such passion that I never forgot his improvised review. Now, almost 30 years later I find it at Amazon, second hand of course, and order it. Such a lapse of time had not went away without leaving Vance Packard's investigations in a far, far away past. However it should be of interest for historians and researchers of the evolution of management in America because today there are far better, more academically accurate, works on the subject. That said I shall confess that the book pleased me a lot and finally confirmed that my brother's review was, for the time, correct."
3,Good Vid but falls short,"This is a good video, showing some technical tricks but no big gaps or 20 stair drops like you would expect from a good skate video. Muska and Glifberg have just breif video parts. A little kid (Mikey Chen) is featured more than the 2000 street skater of the year!(Muska) The video shows variaty by having a bails section with some good limb crushing action. There are some fights and skaters getting arrested and the cuss words are consored for the young ones. This is a skate video worth buying, but there is a better bang for your buck out there."
1,Very poor quality sound,I was quite pleased to find all of the features of this system plus an extra phone for under $50. But the sound quality is terrible. This one is going back.
3,Not hand dipped,"It's my own fault for not reading the description carefully enough, but I was expecting hand-dipped sticks, not factory made. Probably 20% of these sticks go out before they burn fully and the Dragonsblood just doesn't smell as good as the sticks you buy from individuals who craft their own. I will use them when I run out of my preferred stock in a pinch, but I won't buy any more."
1,Not complete,Again I agree with other coments. I got this book as a Xmas present becos I asked for it. Thought it would have Cyprus and Malta wrecks in it. This aint a guide to the Med its more like a guide to a few wrecks off the writers back door.Details are not good enough for serious diveing.
3,No blood on these tracks,"No question it sounds great - technically this album is nearly flawless. But in my opinion it hasn't aged well. What sounded cool in 1977 now sounds well-suited for the elevator or quiet shopping at an upscale mall. There's no heart, soul, or blood on any of these tracks - cold, calculated, and inanimate are words that sum it up pretty well. What happened to the guy who sang like something depended on it on the Royal Scam?And let's be honest. Any album that features the pseudo-soulful moanings of the vastly overrated Michael McDonald sucks in direct proportion to the length of said moanings."
1,The bad part about music from the 1970's,"This album, as well as all of the other Steely Dan records, represent where music from the 70's went sour. The 70's did provide listners with an excellent array of artists. But with Steely Dan, we are left with yet another lounge jazz-rock band, whom you are better off spending $4 for a screwdriver at your local Ramada Inn's bar and listening to their house band, than spending the $12 it costs to buy this, or any other Steely Dan CD. In simple terms, the music is corny and generic beyond belief. And the lyrics are reminiscent of an elementary school's poetry fair."
5,Good stuff,CD came the day as promised. Greart quality recording. Original recording was really good to start out with. Can feel the 80's fusion jazz recording. Stuff like this would never fade.
5,Possibly The Best ALBUM in History,"there are no Bad songs on AJA.A musical masterpiece that continues to sell.Fagan and Becker chose the best session me in the business and the music is tasty and emotiona.the musicianship and the recording is top notchStill sounds fresh and clean after all these years.If you missed this one when it was new because you were""born too late"" get it and enjoy."
5,what's wrong with amazon!,"When I saw that this album was NOT listed as an ""essentialrecording"" by Amazon I just had to respond.... This is certainly essential, assuming you like Steely Dan (and not liking them is hard to believe!). This is simply an excellent CD from beginning to end; a musical treat to the senses. For me this is their best- very original, very jazzy, very Steely Dan!"
5,Durable Quality,This is perhaps the best Steely Dan album. It is an excellent example of fusing voice and instrumentation into a pleasing blend.
5,Steely Dan - Aja,"I have always enjoyed this album. Since dumping my vinyl collection I have been replacing my favorites with Mp3s and CDs. I would certainly recommend this album to anybody who enjoys an easy, soft rock sound with a funky twist. My only complaint is not about this album it is the way Amazon lists the info for their albums. They have this one listed as an ""Original Release"" date of Nov. 23, 1999. That may be the release date of the Mp3/CD copy or the date Amazon started selling it but ""Original Relase"" date of this album was Sept. 23, 1977 and that is the info I wish they would display.CheersJim"
5,The finest Steely Dan of all!!!,"Of all the Steely Dan I have collected, this has to be their very best!!! Smooth, raw, jazzy, funky, and moody all in one CD. Of all the Steely Dan tunes (ever) 'Josie' has to be my favorite. If you are only going to buy one CD by Steely Dan, do yourself a big favor and buy this one!!! You will not be sorry!! It is a treasure and an all time classic!!! On a 1-5 is is a 10!!!"
5,Steely Dan: Aja.....Ahhhhhh,"Smooth, rich, almost silky, but never slick. This is the best of Steely Dan. A must for those brandy-in-the-snifter, feet up, after-dinner-with-friends nights. Wonderful!"
5,AJA by Steely Dan,"1) Black Cow....2) AJA .....3) Deacon Blues ....4)Peg ....5) Home at last .... 6) I got news ....7) Josie..... This is the classic Steely Dan Band album. Recorded in ""CRC"" format with HI-FI stereo channel XPQ enhancements. Glossy jacket was only relased for he first 10,500 copies. Jacket should have the CRC sticker on back lower right corner. Released in 1977 and is still collected and listened to around the world."
5,Be cautious if you buy this album....,"I've been listening to this album (started with the LP in 1977, wore that out until the CD came out) for a long, long time. Each listen still brings a previously unheard riff. Be careful if you are not a jazz fan. Prior to getting into Steely Dan in 1977, I was listening mostly to Top 40 pop. Having listened to Aja and absolutely being engrossed by it, I read the liner notes, noted the talented musicians who played and next thing I know, I'm buying albums by Lee Ritenour, Victor Feldman, Larry Carlton, etc. For me, Steely Dan's Aja suddenly became a one way bridge from pop to the wonderful world of jazz, it changed my musical tastes. This is the album for me to take ""If you would be sent to a deserted island with only one CD..."""
5,Steely Dan's Last Great Album,"AJA was Steely Dan's last great album. After five fairly hard-rocking jazz-, blues-, and R&B-based masterpieces in a row, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker must have realized that they'd taken cynicism as far as it could go with THE ROYAL SCAM, and were thinking, ""Where do we go from here?"" With AJA, they found an answer, playing complex, jazzy, easy-listening pop-rock that epitomizes the essence of cool in rock & roll. With its roots in Basie rather than Berry, AJA provides an escape from the noisy punk rock and prefabricated disco and teen-idol pop dominating the music world in 1977, and, unlike the duo's late-90s/early-00s ""comeback"" albums (ALIVE IN AMERICA, TWO AGAINST NATURE, EVERYTHING MUST GO), this one has real soul in it, showing R&B roots as well, albeit in a mellower way than the first five albums did. If you buy this CD, along with the first five, you'll have all the Steely Dan you need."
5,"THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM, EVER MADE...PERIOD","THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE ALBUM, FOR 31 YEARS SINCE IT'S RELEASE IN 1977.NOW IN 2008, IT STILL IS TRULY THE GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME.THE SECOND BEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME IS PERFECT ISLAND NIGHTS - BOBBY CALDWELL, RELEASED IN 2005. CHECK IT OUT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED..GOD BLESS, THE GENIUSES DONALD FAGEN & WALTER BECKER, WE THANK GOD FOR THESE GREAT TALENTS. AMEN"
2,A disappointment,"This review is for the Japanese SACD version of the disk and focuses on the audio quality.For the very high price of this disk, I was disappointed. The sound quality is little better, if any at all, than a standard CD. Given the fanatical devotion that Steely Dan has always shown to recording quality, I just can't believe this is a representation of the master tape. So while I highly recommend the music, this version is just too much money for too little quality. Buy a standard CD and use the savings to get some of the other fine SACD and DVD-Audio Steely Dan (and Donald Fagen) offerings."
5,Steely Dan's best album,"This is, in my opinion, the summit of Steely Dan's career (and I have all of their albums). It is the group's best mix of studio alchemy, jazz/rock and witty lyrics. While the album's sound is in the vein of the rightfully hated ""smooth jazz,"" Becker and Fagan's creations exist on a plain far above the sleep inducing genre. This album is so good that it almost ends too fast. After only seven songs the listener is left wanting more (and the follow-up album Gaucho was a huge disappointment)."
1,Did not match my expectations,Is not the kind of book that a student in initial education certification program can use productively until other more basis courses are taken.
5,the alaskan,"The Alaskan is an excellent novel describing the characterand trials, tribualtions and aspirations of a bygone generation.One, the likes of which we may never see again.Alan HOLT, A MAN'S MAN VERSUS ROSSLAND. The first a keeperof raindeer as cattle, the last a greedy profiteer and opportunist. Enter MARY Standish. WHAT HAS SHE GOT TO DOWITH ALL THIS. WELL I WON'T SAY MORE. The action is fastpaced and is way superior to any of the 2nd and third ratestuff you see in the movie-houses. It reads like a scriptfor a hollywood feature film on the level of Amistad.I highly recomend reading this novel. The characters are real and memorable. It is of special not how Mary STANDISH CONSIDERSHERSELF AM AMERICAN WHILE ALAN HOLT CONSIDERS HIMSELF AN ALASKAN.Must reading for people who are curious about Americas recent past and the price it had to pay in becoming an Empire and the people that made it happen thru blood, sweat & tears."
1,An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,This short film was not real interesting to me because it had very little dialogue. The surprise ending was not real good. The director did give a few clues away for the ending. I think the film could have used more dialogue. The film needed more speaking and less music. I would not recommend anyone to get this video. I would recommend someone to make the film better.
1,Great Film...Terrible Reproduction,"I first saw this film (16mm) when I was in school. I was delighted to recently discover that the original was available in more modern formats. My delight was short lived. One would think that in this ""digital"" age a reproduction would be as good if not better than the original...WRONG! The reproduction is shadowed, faded, scratchy- sounding, and overall, certainly NOT worth the money. I sincerely hope that someone with a sense of cinema history and the necessary technological skills would take-on the project of creating a competent reproduction of this film to prevent its loss to future generations."
3,"great film, poor transfer","I am confused - the Amazon page shows a cover for the DVD - what arrived in the email was a clear plastic case one would buy at Staples with a DVD that could have been made on a home computer. The actual picture quality looks like something that was transferred from film to Videocassette and then to DVD after many years of use. Are there two versions of this available? It is a great film and I'm glad I have it, but I'd like to know if there is a better version than the one I have is published by ""Mad Phat Enterprises 2009: Copyright: Video Yesteryear 1983."
5,Great Film Ruined by a Poor Print,"This short dramatic film is a beautiful achievement in filmmaking that exceeds the expectations created by the original short story. There is an apology at the start of the DVD warning that the film print used to make the DVD was of poor quality due to age. Black and white prints usually hold up much better than color film stocks, and the film is not exceptionally old. This is a shame because I find it difficult to believe that a better print of this film could not be obtained by the distributor. Five stars for the quality of the original film, but one star for the quality of this DVD."
2,Better DVD version,"For those fans of this film looking for the highest video quality, the best option is probably the DVD version released in France, containing ""Occurrence"" and the other two Bierce stories also adapted by filmmaker Enrico. The French DVD has very high video/audio quality, and of course nearly all dialogue in the filim is spoken in English. However the DVD is region 2 only, so you will have to convert it with computer DVD burning to enable US playback.amazon.fr/riviere-du-hibou-Anne-Cornaly/dp/B000NJM5DS"
2,poor visual quality,"I ordered this film for my Media Aesthetics class to demonstrate principles of cameras, lenses and editing. There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the film that suggests the distributor has done its best to get a clean copy of the film. I have a hard time believing that this is anything other than an old kinescope film shot off a TV monitor back when it aired on the Twilight Zone and then fuzzied up to remove video artifacts. Scratches are to be expected, but this film is so dark as to be nearly unwatchable. Even the free version on YouTube is better quality."
2,It depends on your audience but...,"The DVD starts with the warning that the film is old and the DVD has not been cleaned up in any way. Gee..it would help if that warning was right next to the title on Amazon. Some scenes were hardly visible onscreen. As an adult, I could appreciate some of the scenes and look past the murky audio and blurry visuals, but I dreaded even attempting to show this to my eleventh grade students. They HATED it! It was an interesting interpretation for its time, but the part where Peyton runs toward his wife and runs toward his wife and runs toward his wife and...ad nauseum...it looks like a 60s hair commercial. ""The closer she gets the better she looks."" I know what the director was trying to do, and it may have worked back then, but my kids, were moaning, ""Come ON, already!"" It's worth a look if you have some film students who will appreciate the effects and directorial choices, but do not buy this in hopes of clarifying the original story for your high school students."
3,An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,"Saw this years ago on 16mm and loved it then. Perhaps a bit less so this time around - maybe because I knew the ending? Nevertheless, it was still a good one."
4,memorable,"Actually, I have not seen this DVD. I saw this on the Twilight Zone when it was originally on (how long ago was that, 40 years or so?). I still remember it vividly, and can still hear the song ""A Livin' Man"" in my head. The whole thing is haunting, and was to this then-prepubescent girl. I do plan on ordering it, and if you haven't seen it, I recommend you buy it as well."
4,A long-standing Oscar classic,"Well, here's the answer to the trivia question: ""Which episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" won an Academy award? It was this film, which aired as the last ""new"" episode of the original classic TV series way back in 1964. Along with its Oscar, it also won an award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1962. Rod Serling's tacked-on narration for the ""Twilight Zone"" airing is just as appropriate today as it was back then: ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge--in two forms, as it was dreamed, and as it was lived and died. This is the stuff of fantasy, the thread of imagination...the ingredients of the Twilight Zone.""It may not have any explosions or erratic editing for the kiddies, but it's a great little film."
1,Not the Oscar-winning film!,"This DVD (which I'm returning) contains a very poor, degraded copy of the Oscar-winning film, as editted, dubbed and re-titled for ""The Twilight Zone."" The lack of the ORIGINAL film (not repackaged for TZ), or any of the original credits makes me seriously question whether this is even an authorized release. Only the TZ-style onscreen credits remain. Very disappointing presentation of what is otherwise a beautiful film."
1,Nope,This book is a collection of articles and information from other mainstream books on the topic. It relies heavily on the writings (including one entire chapter) of Lester Grau and Ahmad Jalali. The rest of the information you can google for.Far better to read what Lester Grau actually wrote. I really didn't find anything of value in this book except for American Cave clearing techniques.
2,A Hack Job,"I have to echo some other comments posted on this book, specifically those dealing with the author's prolific use of other writings. Yes, he gave the original writers credit, but how about some original ideas?The war in Afghanistan is ripe for a full accounting of the Coalition and Afghan efforts, but this book falls short. What could, or should, have been an insightful look into the tactics and history of the Taliban instead read like an Army training manual.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is becuase the background section on Afghanistan is concise and to the point, unlike the rest of the book."
3,cool DVD single!,"This DVD is great. It comes with Jessica Simpson's videos ""With you"" and ""Sweetest sin"", besides its making offs.""Sweetest sin"" is one of the sexiest videos of all times. Jessica is awsome in the waterfalls with her husband, Nick Lachey. She looks free and happy to express her feelings and sing about sex without any guilty.The making off is interesting, showing how the video was conceived and how cold the water was at the day of the shooting.""With you"" is a catchy pop song which has become the symbol of MTV's ""Newlyweds"" show. It is a kind of summary of what happened in season 1, having Jessica e Nick's home as the set. On the video, Jessica eats ""chicken of the sea"", making fun of herself, and lies on a floor full of dirty clothes (remember the pilot episode?).The making off is cool, showing the interaction between the video director and Jessica, who was responsible for the video/single success.If you are a Jessica fan, buy this DVD right now. You won't regret!"
1,Awful!,This has to be one of the worst songs ever produced and sang! Jessica's vocals are horrendous and the entire time she sounds like a squealing pig!! The video is even worse - it was obviously made for less than $1 and she makes out with her husband the entire time! I would think she could come up with something more original to show people than that! I advise you to throw this one in the trash along with her album!!
1,worse then bad,"Avoid!This is an italian disasterpiece, with nothing to offer its viewer.(If Cameron Mitchell cant save it,believe me,no one can!)Whats even worse then the film itself,is the technical quality of theprint Alpha home entertainment used to master this dvd. Dont buy it!Christian Karlsson,Sweden"
2,Author in Denial,"Atrocities were committed by both sides during the revolutionary war. This is not in doubt, and historian's tend to forget the American ones. Tarleton's record HAS been misinterpreted over the centuries, but I felt that the author spent too much time trying to exonerate his idol from obvious charachter flaws. The bottom line is that the British Legion used very harsh tactics during the war and the commander WAS responsible for his men, whether he was there or not. I found myself thinking of the excuses used at Nuremberg in 1945-46. The author did dispell many of the myths but the idol worship needed to be toned down a bit. To this reader another opportunity to put the real Tarleton in perspective was lost."
4,Great Magazine,"I enjoy this magazine, and reading about rifles, and new rifle products. If there was one thing I would change, it would be to review fewer ""high-end"" rifles that most of us will never be able to own."
4,Archaeology/Autobiography,"Paul Ilton, a friend of Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, was an archaeologist and collector of antiquities who lived and worked in Egypt and the Middle East from the 1920'a until his death in 1957 (just prior to the publication of this book). Although his escapades could at times rival those of Indiana Jones, he would not be admired today for his secretive collection methods (he refused to divulge where some of his artifacts came from, making collectors who own some of his pieces today -- myself included -- only guess at their actual origins). Although not the greatest autobiography, the book is interesting in that it explains much about the approach to archaeology in the late 19th and first half of the twentieth centuries, with Ilton typical of the many less-than-professional ""history hunters"" of that era."
4,Had to get it to replace one from our childhood.,"My mother had a similar one when we were kids. It was much sturdier, but then again, they made things to last back then. The original chair had been burned in a bonfire during a bachelor party. The chair has always been remembered as the beezer chair. That is where we had to sit when Mom gave us our beezers. It was sacrificed to the Gods of the Haircut. At the time, it was very old, the seat torn many years before. My Mom just turned70 and I gave it to her as a birthday present. She was all excited. The chair stirred many memories. So while the quality was not of the same calibar as the original, the memories made it priceless."
3,Kitchen stool / chair,With free shipping and tax free due to my location it was time to replace an older model (15 years. The new one is better in some ways but you should have some mechanical ability and a good screwdriver or you may strip out some of the preset fastner receivers. I had to find another screw and used a stainless that basically retapped the screw slot. It makes it much easier if you have a third hand while you assemble. I also used a six pack and did it when time was not an issue. The instructions were done very well.
3,Received chair,I received my chair quickly and with no problems. The quality of the chair was 'NOT' up to my standards. It is very flimsy and if I use it for a small ladder I don't feel safe. The chair has come in handy when I needed it for a small child to sit on at the dinner table.
4,COSCO CHAIR,"ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THE SEAT COULD BE A BIT DEEPER. OTHER THAN THAT, EASY PUT TOGETHER AND I LOVE IT"
3,Not your grandma's Cosco,"My daughter has been wanting one of these to keep in her pantry so I ordered one for her birthday. Other reviewers are right that this doesn't compare to the Cosco my grandma had in her kitchen, but that's true of everything. The seat is very small, like for a toddler, and the step stool isn't very sturdy. I didn't feel comfortable at all on the second step. I wasn't exactly embarrassed to give this as a gift, but if I had seen it ahead of time, I wouldn't have bought it."
3,Too small for average adult,"I need a step stool to reach the upper kitchen cabinet shelves. Combining the step stool with a chair is a great concept. But the chair is so small even I find it uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend this chair for an ""average"" adult. Perhaps the product should be named as Retro Yellow Chair with Step Stool for Kids.The chair serves the purpose as a step stool. But the small chair is disappointing. There is a market for a step stool chair that is comfortable and stylish. This product can be great with a redesign to accommodate average adults so the chair can be used as it is intended."
3,Very retro - assembly was not pleasant,"The Retro Step stool is functional and really looks like the one from years ago - very cool if you like retro. The yellow is truly a very pale yellow.The only negative thing about this product was the assembly of the yellow horizontal bars that go on the bottom of the legs. They were not shaped properly and kept coming off. We had to use A LOT of muscle to get the screw tight enough to hold it in place - and that extra force caused us to crack the paint that was on the bars :-(.I would have sent it back but my husband insisted he could ""make it work"" and get it together."
2,Learned to Believe,"This chair was not at all what I thought it would be. I have learned to believe the customer reviews after this purchase! I should have known that people who take the time to write reviews are either really happy or really disappointed with the product and their opinions should be taken into consideration BEFORE purchasing an item. This chair is cheaply constructed and somewhat difficult to assemble. The end result is an uneven, wobbly chair that is only semi-safe to stand on! If this is an example of American workmanship, I think we are in real trouble. I would not recommend this chair."
4,"Chair is small, but does it purpose","Easy to put together, chair is too small to sit on properly! As a step ladder it is good as a chair little kids can sit on it! Overall I am happy, I don't need a step ladder in my kitchen or bring a step ladder from wherever!! It's just there concealed like a transformer"
2,small stool,The stool is not very useful. The seat is too small to sit on for more then a few seconds and the steps are too small to accommodate adult feet. The stool is not worth the price unless one just likes looking at it.
2,cosco retro chair/step stool,"I am so disappointed! This chair is very cute in person- however not sturdy. It wobbles like crazy and the steps are very small. Looks like I am going to have to send it back. Was really hoping to have this for my little girl to use in the kitchen with me, however I am afraid she will fall off with all the wobbling. Too bad they don't make them like they used to!"
2,Chair/Stool is not easy to stand on,"I have an old Cosco chair/stool which I have loved for at least 25 years.It's not ""retro"" and I like it much better. This yellow chair/stool has very narrow steps (measures an inch or so smaller) and the stool slides out rather than lifting up and out. If we didn't have to put it together, we would have probably sent it back. We ended up giving it to someone else and I'm still using my older Cosco chair/stoo."
4,Not American Made,"I bought this particular model because it said MADE IN USA in the ad from Target online, however, it was MADE IN CHINA. It's a good-looking stool and sturdy, I'm just disappointed with the false advertising. Mom doesn't use it because the seat is smaller than her last one and doesn't fit her, but I find it comfortable. Target Falsely Advertises American Made. It's a lovely little stool tho."
5,Great gift,"Arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. It was a gift for my boss's boss who was making jokes in a training class that the instructor needed to be clearer because ""She rides the short bus."""
4,McCoy Pottery: Reference Guide,The book had the information that I was wanting and much more. I recommend this to anyone who is interesting in collecting pottery or who is interested in being able to recognize valuable pottery pieces for resale.
5,McCoy Pottery reference and Value Guide book,"this is a beautiful book with a lot of information - i found the McCoy pottery planter that i was looking for and was very pleased at what it was worth - this is a good looking book, also , in fact i have it on my coffee table !!!"
3,"Excellent photos, but ...","While this book offers excellent photos of many McCoy lines, I find that the stated values of the pottery is optimistic ( they seem to be desired values of McCoy collectors more than actual market values). I also don't care for the order in which the pottery is presented. I would rather see all the vases, all the planters, all the cookie jars, etc.. presented together rather than in chronological order. It is much easier to find a piece with an unknown date of production that way.All in all a good book for those who want to get a taste for McCoy, but not an excellent reference book."
3,"Nice training aid, needs more content, too pricey","I received this with my new Cycle Ops Indoor Trainer. I really like the way the DVD puts you into the race and guides you through the recommended intensity levels. I get a really great workout from the DVD. The coaching/commentary can become annoying and I never play the music. Overall, I enjoy using the 30 minute race portion of the DVD and use the warm-up on mute. The rest of the features are not very useful. The DVD advertises that you can choose options to customize your workout but really the warm-up and race are the only workout. The remaining features are just interviews and video from the event. There is a 10-minute preview portion that has some good tips if you are interested in entering racing. I wouldn't purchase the video by its self for the full price."
4,An excellent textbook,"This is one of the best freshmen level textbooks i have come across. The author does an excellent job of summarizing the main theoretical approaches to IR and provides useful introductions to such issues areas as security, international political economy, and international organization. My students find the tables and theory summaries very useful. The book will fit well with many of the IR readers that are available on the markt"
2,weak,"This book is disappointing.The book starts with, and then each chapter returns rather clunkily to, the division between liberalists, realists, radicalists, etc.As in:This is the international system. This is how liberalists see it...and realists...and radicalists...This is war and strife. This is how liberalists see it... and realists...etc.You get the idea!This makes for a fatally dull and ""heavy"" approach to a discipline that can be so exciting if handled properly. Mingst gives students the impression that the whole point of IR is trying to decide which of the -isms is the most valid.It would have been much better to take a less theory-laden approach in the early chapters, allowing students to come up with their own explanations/interpretations of things, and then introduce all the -isms in later chapters.Finally, the book is just not very clearly written. More than once I was at a loss to explain sentences that my students asked me to explain."
5,A Great Book for an overview of the WWII US Army,If you want a good well written book about the rise of Americas Army from a basically small constabulary to one of the great fighting machines. Which then went out to detroy one of the greatest threats to the Republic then you have come to the right place. I especially like how the Author has rightfully laid the credit to one of Americas unsung heros George C. Marshall.An outstanding job as far as I am concerned.
4,Our we headed this way again.,"Very interesting how not prepared our military was between WWI and WWII, makes you really think what it will be like by time our current government done with cuts and downsizing."
3,Popular History,"The way I sum up this book is that it is a hagiography of the U.S. Army in World War II. The author's prose was not scholarly, but that's not a really big problem as long as he gets his point across."
3,Scales?,My guitar instructor hates this book. He says its too complex and not needed. I do what my instructor says.
4,Great book.,"Easy to use, ist compact, a little more graphics would be fine, like a resume sheet, it is organized. s"
5,Amazing,"This book is better than a guitar teacher. It shows you the scales, but more importantly it illustrates how they fit together. If you're a guitar player wondering how some players can shred up and down the neck, its because they understand how scales work, exactly what this book teaches you. This book has made it possible for me to improvise solos. If you don't understand how the positions of scales fit together, and major and minor relativity, this book is for you. I have a scale and arpeggio book, the Yngwie Malmsteen DVD, Rock Discipline with (John Petrucci), and this book has been most beneficial to my playing."
1,"Nice Book, poor packing","The book came to me standard mail with no cardboard backing. The two staples that hold the book together are bent, so that means the book will fall apart in no time. The book was bent up and warped. Very poor packing."
5,Handy little book on scales,Clear cut and prescise voicings on all the scales so you just pick up and play and use it as a reference point..does not explain scales to you much if you are a beginner otherwise its great and invaluable reference..
4,A little preciousity of a book,"This is indeed a great book to have to practice and/or to remember your favorite scales.It's small, lightweight, but don't be misled: it has a lot of useful information for such a low price.A great finding."
4,Handy tool,"If you adopt to use this book to learn scales, you will build progressively a large arsenal of improvisation material from pentatonic minor to harmonic minor. Very good reference book that shows you how to build and use scales. Some guys I sometimes play with recommended this book. I have this book and it is very good book for reference about scales. It has all that you need to know. Simple reading, concise and has a lot of pratical examples."
5,This is the best scale book!!!,"Wow, I have been playing guitar for over 25 years. I have seen a lot of books on scales. This one is hands down the best. This little $5.95 book has more info on scales than any of the books that cost 3 times that amount. Troy is a very good teacher. This book really helps you understand the scales and the relationships between them. The only critisism I can give is that I wish it would relate the chords to the scales better or at least give the basic chords that go along with each scale. I like how Troy starts simple by starting with the Minor Pentatonic scales and building from there. This book is great as a reference book or as a method book. It is nice that he also give the scales in different case to help contrast them. I can not say enough for this book. Oh and the explanation on modes is brilliant. I never was able to really grasp the concept even after having two different guitar teachers try to explain them. With this book I really get it now. This book Rocks!"
3,Kindle Edition Limitations,"Overall this is a very helpful book. However, on nearly every page there are diagrams of fretboards. As you may or may not know, you cannot zoom in on images using a Kindle Reader. This makes seeing the small diagrams troublesome. Buy the print book."
4,Nice Scale Book!,This is a very concise easy to follow reference guide for scales. Much better in it's explanation than many other sources of information I have come across on scales in book format or on the web. I really like this book and see it as all I need to keep me going regarding scales for some time. I definitely recommend it.
2,Not what I was looking for.,"Perhaps this would be more useful for a more advanced player, but it did not give me enough step by step training for my skill level."
5,Excellent,"As a fan of Milton, I enjoyed the book. At the free price point, I couldn't be happier and it's an excellent read."
4,Even the Russians have problems...,"...I enjoyed this play immensely, although some of the relations were hard to keep track of. The characters were strongly written, and everything flowed really well."
4,Appealing,"In a world full of whining and complaining about insignificant things, it's fun to once again admire Anton Chekhov and his ability to make this seem imperative to human life. While in the setting of Russian gentry, everything as falling apart, and the lives of the characters are no more gratifying than anyone else's."
4,Music from Colonial Williamsburg,"Tayler Vrooman was a major force in establishing music in the taverns of Colonial Williamsburg. In 1964, when he was 32, Vrooman recorded an album for Decca called ""Songs from a Colonial Tavern,"" and the same year compiled a songbook (with the same title) consisting largely of the songs on the LP. Both the recording and the book are out of print, but readily available on Amazon, and for anyone wanting an introduction to popular music of the mid-18th century, I recommend tracking them both down. (For the record, Vrooman died at the age of 58, but his legacy lives on: Colonial Williamsburg now employs a dozen or more musicians who circulate nightly in its four restored taverns to create the appropriate musical ""atmosphere."")"
5,Extremely well written,"I received this book as a gift, and before reading it, I checked-out the reviews online. Honestly, I didn't have high expectations of the book..But then I read it... here is some of the best quotations I have read...""Love is a form of childhood in the way we become capable again of being wholly enthralled, able to believe so much so easily so intensely""""--- the sort of friendship where a separation of time and space is merely a pause in an ongoing conversation""I can quote so many others well written phrases by the Author. The book is an extremely well written, well organized exploration of the human mind.. it touches every feeling you ever thought you had in you.. it shows you the thin line between what actually happens and what takes place in our own imagination.I would recommend this book... and next on my list to read would be other books by Yann Martel...."
3,Yes for most Yann Martel fans,"While this book is a very different type of read from Martel's later ""Life of Pi"" (which was excellent), it does seem to foreshadow one of the central themes in ""Pi"" - in particular, the theme of the incredible power of tragedy to transform us and our perceptions of the people around us. In this book, tragic events literally transform the gender of the protagonist (twice) and thus his/her perception of and interaction with the world. In ""Pi,"" tragedy transforms Pi's recollection of reality in his attempt to live with his losses on a daily basis. While the gender transformation is not handled as well in ""Self"" as in ""Middlesex"" by Jeffrey Eugenides(also highly recommended), I would certainly recommend this book to Martel fans who are interested in seeing the development of this very talented writer."
3,Doesn't click,"Self is a novel rich in ideas, but struggles to find an engaging narrative. Maybe the (near) lack of chapters was meant as a literary device, but in practice, it impairs the book's readability. And notwithstanding the book's title, it is self-indulgent at times. Much of the story just seems to be Martel's life with the fact of his transformation to a woman being beside the point. For sure, he tried to explore the female psyche, but it seems to fall short.Martel shows his talent and fondness for wordplay (e.g. ""Change was his habit and habits are hard to change."") and metaphor (""'You could stay here', I said, a statement I hoped was a suitcase, neutral on the outside, but of changeable contents inside depending on its destination.""), but unlike in the masterful Life of Pi, Martel cannot seem to organize these clever bricks into a house of meaning."
4,crazy2bhere is full of it!!!,"I enjoyed this book very much just as I enjoyed Life of Pi and his collection of short stories titled The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios. All are worth the read. There is another review on this forum by ""crazy2bhere"", to whom I would like to say: GET OFF IT. Where do you rank among authors? Perhaps you can divulge your name so readers can google YOU. Strangely, it seems you take Yann Martel's success personally and bitterly and your review annoys me. Everyone is certainly entitled to his own opinion but I find your criticism excessive."
5,Best Map of New Zealand W/O a Doubt!,"This is a great map of New Zealand. Its unfortunate that it is becoming hard to find.The map was printed a few years ago, so some things have changed, but for 95% of the areas you would be traveling to it is very accurate. Most of the changes are not the addition or changing of streets but rather the condition of the roads. Many roads that are said to be unsealed are now sealed, especially in the North Island.The map is also made out of a plastic type material that is waterproof. You could dump a bucket of water on the map and it would still be fine, maybe just cleaner! Wish they made all maps out of this material.Great map if you can find it, and its worth the hunt!"
2,It's all downhill since Screamadelica,"Don't know why I still give each of Primal Screams new releases a try , since everythings been getting progressively worse . It's nice when artists grow and mature but these guys seem to have gotten caught in some sort of terrible electronica trap . I guess having left such elements of tough out of their earlier records , they've felt the need to really make up for it on XTRMNTR and the previously released Vanishing Point ."
3,A Tale Of Two Albums,"I'm not usually a big fan of techno music. I know a lot of mainstream stuff (Fatboy Slim, Chemical Brothers, ect.) and I also know that XTRMNTR isn't a bad album. It's not a great one either though. The first half of this album (Kill All Hippies -> Pills) is full of a lot of anger and is very loud. These songs are diverse and I have never heard anything quite like them before. Starting with track 6 all the way to the ends though is quite another subject. These songs all sound the same, are soft, and almost put me to sleep while I was in my car on a road trip. If you are one of those who doesn't mind owning a cd with half good tracks go ahead and buy it. If you only collect cds destined to be ""classics"" that will endure the test of time, don't waste your money."
1,THIS ALBUM DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE ONE STAR!,"I don't know this group, but from what I can see from their songs, they're probably full of hatred and racism."
4,"the greatest ""rebel band"" of the past 15 years","I've been a huge Scream fan since 91' and always enjoy their surprising directions in music. On this one, they are continuing where they left off from Vanishing Point and wrote some excellent songs. My favorites are Accelerator, Exterminator, and Shoot Speed/Kill Light. Kill all Hippies and Keep your Dreams are good also. I saw their concert in LA and it was very good. Steve Jones from the Sex Pistols joined them on stage and they rocked out."
2,Contender for Most Over-rated album of 2000 ?,"The British music press have been fawning over Primal Scream and their latest album since the release of Xtrmntr early this year. In their furious desire to embrace a band 'that matters' they have grabbed on to the incoherent and hypocritical adolescent rantings of Bobby Gillespie and co. The first four tracks on this album are of top quality, if somewhat derivative of the Stooges and Velvet Undergound circa White Light/White Heat. They also owe a lot to Mani's exquisite driving basslines, honed in the early 90s with the Stone Roses. After that however, it falters badly. A terrible attempt at white-boy rap with 'Pills';a jazz-rock fusion which Soft Machine would have been ashamed of; a remix of a track already on the album; and the inclusion of a MBV remixed track which had already been released a year ago. Album of the year? I really don't think so."
3,their best album? give me a break,"after one listen of this album...i was disappointed...after several other listens i was still disappointed. definitely only for the hardcore primal scream fan or if you like loud abrasive music. i got screamadelica when it 1st came out and recently picked up vanishing point. i'd have to rate xtrmntr a distant 3rd to the two albums i just mentioned. as far as this being a ""groundbreaking"" album that a lot of people seem to be saying i just dont see it. actually gillespie's vocals really get on my nerves when he's screaming. ""keep your dreams"" is probably the best song on the album imo. this one may be going to the used cd store."
4,Good - But not that good,"Well, I bought this cd becuase i've heard primal scream before and liked the stuff. But, some of the songs left me wondering why the hell I even wasted my money. On the other hand, Kill all hippes, Swastika Eyes, and Exterminator kept my attention. But when i get bored of those songs, will i ever take out the cd again? I don't think so."
5,"PRIMAL SCREAM, YOUNG, GIFTED and ANGRY",This is a full-on assault on the senses. It's noisy. It's uncomfortable. It's demanding. It's the best album around at the moment. It'll blow your socks off. A classic.
5,I'm Gonna Tell The Truth!,"As NME states, this album is war that you can dance to. True, but I find this album more like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off at a dance club. A very bold change of direction for the group, that leads them on a path that few groups have taken. Very heavy, crunchy, electronic beats mixed with enough guitar arranagements to still keep this album on the rockin' tip. As for the lyrics, check out the song ""Exterminator"", ""Swastika Eyes"", and ""Pills"". ""Pills"" was supposedly written about a time when Bobby Gillespie was freaking out on acid and then started yelling at himself in the mirror. You can't stop this album, might as well grad it and deal with the aftermath."
2,More about male angst than kayaking,"This book is a depressing story of a failing marriage. The fact that the relationship unravels during a kayak trip in Baja does not in any way make this a good read for kayakers interested in paddling Baja. If, on the other hand, you'd like to experience that miserable feeling of a relationship going down the tubes, this is your book! Enjoy."
1,Homage to ego,"Not just whiny, but pretentious. The writer is a good adventurer. I'm sorry that his marriage did not work out. But I had to quit reading after a chapter or two. The author is preachy, and frequently reminds the reader of his morally superior views. Even when I agreed, I found the author's constant self-praise exhausting."
4,Vandoren 5RV Lyre B flat clarinet mouthpiece,"Better than any mouthpiece normally provided by the instrument manufacturer. Easy blowing and fits the instrument well. Not sure of the difference between this and the Vandoren B45, but cheaper."
3,It is OK,"It is OK. It goes over some basics, but not with any particular flair or insight. The game footage at the end could have been very helpful, but the clips were not particularly well selected, and the editing was confusing."
3,666 - Not just for breakfast anymore!,"This is a decent album, featuring some great loops and some mixing worthy of DJ Shadow. I think of it as what would happen if Prodigy had been spanish. Worth checking into."
3,A classic,"Please note that the author, James Wycliffe Headlam , was a British scholar and public servant who contributed to the Versailles Treaty. He died in 1929, and this book was written in 1899. It is a classic, but does not benefit from modern access to additional documents, nor the perspective of a post war world. (If that's an advantage). Just so you know what you are getting."
3,Meh-Old Stuff,Not the newer stuff. Older Cesar so it's a bit unrefined as he was still honing his craft. Not bad though by any means.
4,Highly educational and fun!,"I don't watch much TV, so the first time I heard about the dog whisperer was from my friend who is a dog sitter. And then, when I needed a good movie on animal psychology for our psychology class, I decided to take a look. And oh, boy, Cesar Millan does true magic with our four-legged friends. And it's extremely fun too. I think these series should be an essential watch for anyone who even contemplates adopting a dog."
3,Pretty good,"This DVD gives a pretty good selection of the Dog Whisperer episodes. There's a little bit for everyone - dogs that are aggressive, or fearful - but it just gives a taste of what The Dog Whisperer is all about. I would say it's a good start if you want to start a library of episodes, but definitely not enough if you want a more comprehensive range of episodes"
5,Can't beat the Dog Whisperer,"Whether you are a veteran dog owner or a new dog owner, Cesar Milan provides excellent tips for training and behavior problems. I highly recommend any of his books or DVDs in helping dog owners be at peace with their well behaved dog."
3,Best of Dog Whisperer,"There weren't a lot of examples that pertained to my situation but it was a start and I plan to use more of his videos to help with training my dog and a new dog I plan to get. In using his suggestions, I have seen a positive change in my dog after only a few days. He knows what he talking about."
3,Encaustic + Paper,"this was very good content, but a bit overpriced. if a booklet would have come along with it, for easier reference, it would have been a more practical way to access its content. but, nice work, none the less."
3,My introduction to Jackson,"This is my first Jackson novel. I gave her a try because a friend of mine loves her and we typically have a similar taste in books. This was not the best introduction; more like an awkward coffee date that ended sooner than anticipated. There were humorous moments with fabulous descriptions, but those moments did not happen often enough. I could see a second date in the future with a better pick - probably ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle."""
3,Pleasant and Cute.,"A nice read, delightful author. Very tame subject matter. Simply cute and easy, probably a good vacation read."
4,Amsuing,"As a stay at home, I enjoyed reading this book. It is very funny. It is also interesting to see the change in times. This book was written in the 1940s. Especially of interest is the author's description of her two week hospital stay for child birth. These days it is pracically a drive by procedure :) I felt the book dragged at times, but all in all this is an enjoyable read and certainly one I would recommend to other moms."
4,"When the going got tough, she got going!","Shirley Jackson had three highly animated children which she, more or less, kept in check. I admired the way she told her trials in an always up-beat slightly humorus but usually exhasperated style. That is a main point that made me want to keep reading. It was not a dark dramatic book ,which it very well could have been. While reading, it really made me want to ""keep my chin up""."
5,Funny,"I generally hate domestic plots or cutesy toddlers but Shirley Jackson, with her wry sense of humor, helped me to really like this book. Sure, it is outdated but many of the absurd situations and attitudes still apply and it gives you a good middle class view of that period. Recommended!"
5,"Not scary, just funny","At one time, Shirley Jackson was both the scariest and the funniest writer in America. This book may come as a surprise to fans of ""The Lottery"", but don't neglect it on that account; it's still vintage Jackson, complete with a rambling old house (this time not haunted). This is hands down the funniest book about raising children ever written; somehow it manages to treat children as surreal and other (the savages of the title) without ever being condescending. The sequal, _Raising Demons_, isn't quite as good, but is still well worth the read."
5,Hilarious!,Shirley Jackson NAILS the atmoshpere of family life... the strange quirks of children that are accepted as normal by parents who are both good natured and over whelmed by the unending demands of parenthood and the mysterious events that happen in every family --- like where did the pink blanket go?
4,"My least favorite Sabbath album, but still good.","After the great Vol. 4, I knew that Black Sabbath couldn't quite get up to expectations for the next album. And although this album is good, there are a fow songs I could live without.One thing I have to say is that Rick Wickman was both a bless and a curse for this band. He performed and really helped on some great tracks (Sabbra Cadabra), but also played on absolute ...(Who Are You).That said, there are some good songs, like the title song, National Acrobat, Killing Yourself to Live, and Fluff. However, there are some really pretensious songs that are just out of place, like Who Are You? The song's synthizisers are enough to drive one crazy. Also, Looking For Today is just bland. It feels like a throwayay. And Spiral Architect, despite having a great intro, sounds too 70's arena rock to me, especially when the band kicks in.All in all, it's a decent album. Nothing too great, however."
5,Sabbath does it again...,"Black Sabbath is one of the greatest bands ever. Their earliest albums are the best. They all stand out in various ways, and this one does for its uniqueness (by Sabbath standards). Funny thing is, when I listen to this one I don't hear heavy metal. I think of it more as psychadelic/prog rock. It reminds me of stuff like 70's Jethro Tull and mid-late 60's Beatles. Every song flows with creativity and complexity. I do recommend it."
4,Better Than I Remembered,"I've been reacquiring and revisiting all of the ""Ozzy Era"" Sabbath albums, but this time I'm able to take the time and listen to them in chronological order, as opposed to cobbling together dubbed cassettes from friends' collections when I was a teenager.I remember 15 year old me thinking this was the album where they started to ""wuss out"" a little. 43-year old me now recognizes that Sabbath were simply growing beyond, sacrificing a little brute force for some more sophisticated touches. It's also obvious they spent a little more time recording and mixing, because this is the first Sabbath record with the Ozzy vocal sound you hear on his solo albums, more out front and loud and clear."
1,Who are these guys kiding. They got nothing!!,Ive never heard more anoying music in my life.Are these guys trying to play music. I like some heavy music but this isn't music. The wineing shrill voice of Ozzy Ozborne wrecks even his O.K. songs.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHERS,"I was really dissapointed with this one. I got it simply because everyone said it was so damn good. Despite that crazy cover, it is their least heaviest album and it is actually kind of happy sounding, which isn't bad, it's just that Sabbath doesn't do a very good job at it. There are four songs that are pretty good, but that is only half of the album! Overall it's not bad, but you should try any of their first six albums (especially ""Master of Reality"") before this one. Trust me!"
2,"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath","The title track Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath is one of my personal favorites, but professionally the album Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath is one of Sabbath's weaker efforts. The album is pleasant, far from awful, but not as good as we'd expect. The title track is the only real standout, some of the others tracks like Killing Yourself to Live are ok, but don't really count as classics. The Best stuff on this one can be found on We Sold Our Soul For Rock n Roll."
2,A slow decline...,"This was the beginning of a long, slow decline for an early Sabbath fan like me. I remember eagerly buying the vinyl when it came out in early '74 and was a mite dissappointed at how silly it sounded....The title track is a ridiculous Spinal Tap type of tune that skipped after all the times I scratched it with the needle. The only tune of merit (IMO) is Sabbra Cadabra which should always be included on any Greatest Hits CD that they release. The rest is just endless vamping...."
5,A Great Sabbath album!,"This album is really weird. The first time I listened to it I hated it. (I had the other 5 classic sab albums) I thought this was their decent into crap. But then I put it in again and cranked it and I started head banging to ""Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath,"" ""A National Acrobat,"" ""Sabra Cadabra,"" ""Killing Yourself to Live,"" and ""Spiral Architect."" This is one of the best Sabbath albums ever! So, if you hate it at first listen to it one more time."
2,Not worthy sabbath release,This review is for the shm sacd. I can't figure this release out. I mean it is all over the place. A song starts out soft and then gets louder towards the end. It's almost unlistenable. I'm guessing it was the original recording based on the insert that mentions DSD being transferred from the analog master tapes. The whole thing isn't a total waste but damn near close. Not worth the current price tag. Paranoid and the first release are far better sounding and very recommend.
4,Good,"Everyone knows the title song, and everyones opinion is the same, fantastic. A National Acrobat is probably my favourite on this album, although it gets pretty annoying after you repeat it 100 times. Fluff is an instrumental track from Iommi and Geezer. Its not good for the album. Killing Yourself to Live, and Looking For Today are good, but not great. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath doesnt hold the magic of Paranoid. Theres no classic, like Iron Man on this album. Who Are You is horrible, and Spiral Architect, although on the Best Of inst that good."
4,Bloody Awesome!,"While not as entertaining (at least to me) as the previous Vol.4, this one is definately one for anyone's metal collectoin. Definately one of Sabbath's most diverse records, though. The synthesizers and string arrangements comliment Sabbath nicely on songs such as Who Are You? and Spiral Architect. And the harder songs such as the title track, Killing Yourself To Live and A National Acrobat all live up to Black Sabbath's metal tradition. Tony Iommi was, is, and forever will be the master of metal riffs. Looking For Today I like because of its lyrical content; it's the complete and un-varnished truth! and Sabbra Cadabra's piano break-down at the end of the song just wraps the song up nicely. Overall, I would sya if your a fan of metal and like a little diversity, this one's for you."
5,I'M SICK OF THIS!!!,"These albms are too short!! This is ridiclous!! Well I think that SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH and PARANOID are the only ones of the mighty first six that are mandatory if you own WE SOLD OUR SOULS. This one is just great and I mean great. I think it's extremely underated if you have looked at other reviews. I believe that ""a national acrobat"", ""sabbra cadabra"", ""killing yourself to live"", and ""sabbath bloody sabbath"" are as good a four song set as there are on any regular issue sabbath album. I've got to go my sabbath bloody sabbath just popped off and I didnt have repeat on. You know dead air!! THANK YOU THANK YOU PEOPLE I'M GLAD YOU LIKED THE SHOW GOOD NITE AND GOD BLESS!!"
4,"Different, but very good","This album has something special I can't define. Only that it's different from anything Sab had done before and after that! It's like... melodical, psychodelic, a little crazy. Although I prefer the old style. Paranoid, Master Of Reality, and Sabotage are their real masterpieces."
4,Close to 5 stars,"""Sabbath bloody Sabbath"" is the best (overall) album with Ozzy Osbourne on vocals. Compared to other efforts like the debut ""Black Sabbath"" and the poorly produced ""Master of reality"" this is so much better. The band have clearly put a lot of energy into the song writing, and it shows on tracks like the rocking ""Killing yourself to live"" (the best Sabbath song ever?), ""Sabbath bloody Sabbath"", ""National acrobat"", and ""Sabbra cadabra"". Many of the songs are very appealing and not as dark as a lot of their previous efforts. Although Osbourne is a limited singer, he's doing a great job on these unforgettable tunes. This is a true classic, and by 1973 measurements it's heavy!!"
3,Someone Has to Say This Album is Mediocre!,"Not only what I said in the above headline, but this album fairly screams ""THE AVERAGE JOE COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS!"" Sadly, I'd say this is the second or third weakest of Sabbath's first six. The drive, the push, the UMPH just isn't there on this one. If you're new to Black Sabbath, buy something else before you listen to this because overexposure to the music on ""Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath"" leads to premature judgement of the greatest band of all time."
4,The first non-perfect album Sabbath ever released.,"I'll just come out and say it, I think the synths were not needed in this album. In my opinion, the songs that didn't have synths are the standout tracks on the album and I feel the songs that had synths would have been perfectly fine on their own without synth. And it's not because I don't like the space/psychadelic stuff... ""Planet Caravan"" is one of my fave Sabbath songs of all time. Ah well, no need to show the negatives, this album is still really good with only a song, song and a half I don't care for."
4,Humorous and engaging,"I found the book to be humorous and engaging. The rhymes were remenisant of Dr. Seuss' style. At the same time, Lithgow has a paticular wit that stands out, and is enjoyable for the adult reader as well. As a librarian, I recommend it."
3,age level,Believe this is more of a young teen book; it has very large words to be considered a children's book.
5,Fun & Educational,"I bought this for our 7 y.o. son for Christmas b/c he loves manatees. He loves this book & CD, and it has been quite a hit for our entire family. It's fun, cute and educational. We had fun laughing together!"
3,I am not a big celebrity book fan but,My daughter does like this. It's a cute little rhyme about an animal we would not have otherwise known about. The illustration is better than the text. We got ours for free and while she likes it I would not have actually bought it.
2,cute idea doesn't work,The vocabulary is too sophisticated for the target age group. My kids asked me to stop reading it halfway through because I had to explain every other word to them. It would be better to use it as a poem or song in a larger collection for older children.
1,Maybe for older kids or grownups this would be alright,"I love manatees, and I love reading to my daughter so I couldn't pass this book up when I saw it at the book store. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The art is good, not great just good and the text is mostly meaningless rhyming of manatee with made up words (Manatee's eat raisin bran-atee). This is not useful if you are trying to teach your kids to read or increase vocabulary. Worse yet the plot of the story is told primarily through the illustrations which don't have all that much to do with the text. Probably this one is more fun for adults who enjoy reading nonsense than it is for kids, who I imagine would just be confused."
3,WE WERE THE MULVANEYS,"I don't know if I liked this book. I think I did. I finished it. I keep thinking about it. I want to talk to somebody else who has read it. I have so many questions about the parents. I want to understand them, especially the father. First part of book, wonderful family. Second part of book, everybody falls down a well of dysfunction. Third part of book, back to wonderful family. Why? How? This is my first book by Oates and I found it very wordy but it also held me to the page. Even though I'm in the middle of different book by a different author I find myself thinking about the Mulvaneys. I usually think that books and movies that cause me to think about them long after I've experienced them must have value. I don't know whether to recommend it to friends or not but I want them to read it so they can discuss it with me. I bet it would be a good book group read."
1,Why didn't I read these reviews first?,"I could have saved $$ and time! Like many readers, I have a hard time not finishing a book once I've started it. But in the case of WWTM, I think I'll make an exception. This is undoubtedly one of the most torturous books I have encountered in a long time. I have been speed reading to get through it...and after 2 weeks I am only on page 250!! Like others have mentioned, I have read and enjoyed several books by Oates, particularly Bellefleur. But WWTM is trivial, contrived, boring. Need I say more?"
2,Let's Get To the Point,"This book drove me crazy. You must read 100 pages to fine out what the book is about. It's obvious that the author likes to write and write and write. Meanwhile, the reader gets lost more than once wondering what is going on!! I did not like the Mulvaneys. What kind of mother would send her only daughter, a true victum, away and stay with her selfish, drunken husband? It seems as though she did not have any compassion at all! And this was a GOOD family???? I just finished ""Sing Me A Bawdy Song"" and it is a truly great book that moves along. It is fun to read and does not drag on and on and on."
2,Depressing,Such a dark story. An incredibly sad account of what can happen when there is no communication. I found this book to be VERY wordy with alot of unnecessary flashbacks. I found myself depressed by the depth of loss this family endured simply because it couldn't come to terms with an unspeakable act. I'd have a hard time recommending this book to anyone.
2,"Good theme, Bad plot","Though the underlying message In Oats' novel is powerful, the time it takes to get to that point is painful. A single word can send the narrator into a multiple page random story that does not relate in the least to what he was originally talking about. The thoughts seem unorganized as chapters jump from a daughter's trauma to the meeting of the parents. This book is also filled with repetition of family nicknames and descriptions, introducing the oldest son, Michael Jr., ""Mule"" and countless other nicknames as if it was the first time you were hearing of him. These tangents and repetition are frustrating and take away from what had the potential to be a great novel making the stpry somewhat boring and tedious."
4,A Family Hangs Together!,"Marianne, the lovable peace-maker in the Mulvaney's, takes her family throught a violent and terrifying incident to doom and destruction. Victimized, the family becomes powerless in its approach to the heinous crime committed. Joyce Carol Oates demonstrates how each member of the family express his or her feelings toward the crime, the criminal and the victim. Even though the Mulvaney's passionate punishment of the perpretrator overshadows any sympathy to the victim, the family beats all the odds and remains together in the end. I felt linked to the Mulvaney's all through this tale."
4,The saddest book I've ever read.,"A good novel and a good character study of the decline of a family. While I appreciated this novel, however, it convinced me I don't want to read any more Joyce Carol Oates. I was so depressed while reading it that I could barely get out of bed in the morning. So sad."
2,Overly descriptive,"I enjoy a book that will immerse the reader in the story, but the descriptive nature of this book is redundant and at times, very annoying."
4,We were the Mulvaney's,"A moving fictional story about a family tragedy that happened in the 1970's. It happened to the Mulvaney's, a close-knit, farm family in Mt. Ephraim, NY. On Valentine's Day, their bright and pretty daughter was raped at a high school dance. After the rape, the entire ""perfect"" family fell apart. The father was not supportive of his daughter and ordered her to live with other relatives. The daughter who had such a bright future ended up at a community college and lived in a commune. Many other things happened to each of the family members, but in the end they were able to reunite and restore healing to their broken lives."
4,"an intimate look inside a ""perfectly"" dysfunctional family","Many of the reviews I've read about this book complain of the unrealistic or shallow characters. I personally could not put this book down, and read it in a weekend. I suppose if you expect people's behavior in response to traumatic events to be predictable and in character with their every-day behavior, the way this family deals with the crises after Marianne's rape would seem false. I think Oates' phenomenal ability to make the reader empathize with her characters, even when they're behaving horribly, is a gift. I felt for all of them because I could sympathize with their inability to cope with such a horrible thing. Who knows how we will deal with disaster until it happens to us? Oates allows the reader insight into each character's mind through their personal idiosyncrasies, and leaves you with a yearning to see them return to their once vibrant family dynamic."
3,Uneven storytelling,"I found this book to be both gripping and annoying, and ultimately I believe the ending fell flat with a quickly wrapped up conclusion."
5,Stunned by so many bad reviews!,"I read this book the year it was released and it still resonates in my mind when I hear mention of it. It was beautifully written and the character development flawless. Perhaps the negative reviewers had never read any of Ms. Oates works before and weren't prepared for her intensity. Either way, do not let their reviews scare you--it's a great novel!"
2,Hard to get through,"Some reviewers have describe this book as ""tedious"" and ""over descriptive"". I must agree with them, it took me over a month to finish this book, not because of lack of time, simply because I just could not get myself motivated enough to finish it. The first 100 pages are rather boring, I don't believe such a ""perfect"" little family exist anywhere as she describes this family in the first chapters. This book did hit home though, especially towards the end. Mrs. Oates is a brilliant writer and I am not questioning her writing, but this book was rather long and not engaging enough."
2,I finished the book out of a sense of obligation,"My sister gave this to me as a birthday present knowing that I had enjoyed books that seemed to be of a similar nature in the past. Unfortunately, this book was tedious, took forever to develop, and then scattered itself in a manner that caused confusion and broke the events into pieces that diced any interest I had developed in the characters and their lives. While this is by no means the worst book I have ever read, I can't say that I would ever read it again or recommend it to another. In fact, when I move at the end of the month, I can honestly say this book has a very good chance of winding up in the pile to go to Goodwill."
1,Unbelievably boring,"This book was so boring, I can't believe I read the whole, long, drawn out thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but trust me, it doesn't. I agree with what others have said; underdeveloped characters that you don't really care about, too much irrelevant detail, too much getting off on tangents that were hard to follow. I wish I would have read the reviews before reading this book, but my husband gave it to me as a ""gift"". The best thing about the book is that it's so boring it's a good remedy for insomnia. And, to make a boring book worse, the parents who were first portrayed as a good mom and dad who really loved their family, behaved in a disgusting manner toward their raped daughter. It was too revolting."
1,"Carol, What Were You Thinking?","Unfortunately, this was the first book I have ever read by Joyce Carol Oates. It will probably be my last. By no stretch of the imagination could the people at the beginning of the book have turned out to be the ones at the end of the book. Sure, people change. But that much? Oh, please..."
2,Spare Me More Oates,"It is hard to say what I found more more irritating -- this tedious and overwrought saga of the most boring family since ""Father Knows Best,"" or Joyce Carol Oates ability to describe paint dry in fourteen pages or more. WHERE was the story? How are we to believe that any family, especially one brimming with such simple-minded goodness as her Mulvaneys, would so unanimously and wordlessly banish their ""beloved"" daughter because she was date-raped? (or was she? this too is vague) How long is the reader expected to believe (or care) that this family's absent-minded sort of denial be considered plausible as a storyline? Is this neverending story meant to ""explain"" the father's alcoholism?? Does the family, perhaps, just implode from pure shallowness? If Joyce Carol Oates were to participate with actual humans someday, she might not, so desperately, need to lavish her endless windblown vocabulary on such superficial fiction as this."
1,Tedious and Painful... don't buy into the hype,"For all the great reviews this book has received, I found it to just be terrible. The writing was overly descriptive and the characters shallow."
5,Good book-liked it,"I'd like to say that reading through many of these reviews I think some of the people either did not read the book or completely missed the point of it. JCO wrote this book and made extremely realistic and believable. I do not know how some of you can write and say the book is unrealistic and this couldn't happen in real life. Just because Marianne Mulvaney's parents made a bad decision, this does not mean that it's unrealistic. Parents MAKE those bad decisions. You must also take into account Michael Mulvaneys trouble with his parents. Unintentionally he will do the same thing. The only reason some people are giving this book a low rating is because they didn't agree with certain decisions made by the children or parents. This is wrong because if it made them feel strongly about it, it means this is a pretty darn good piece of writing. JCO has once again proved herself to be a terrific writer."
1,Help! I'm drowning...,"Without doubt this must be THE most depressing novel I have read to date. The only words that come to mind to describe this tedious tale are: bleak, grim, dreary, cheerless, desolate, gloomy, dismal, sad, dragging endlessly on!"
3,We Were the Mulvaneys,"Overall I felt the book was well written, however overly detailed. At times I felt like I was struggeling just to get to the next page due to an excessive amount of detail. When I finally finished the book, I enjoyed the overall story but some of the flowery language could have been ommitted."
1,More of the same,"The beginning of this book is promising, and as always, Joyce's prose style is captivating; however, the novel soon descends into what has become almost a cliche in the last ten years or so - disintegration due to sexual violation. Personally, I'm tired of reading about it. I'm quite sure there are deep, interesting, even tortured individuals and families in this world who manage to be so for reasons other than incest or rape. Even when faced with those particular difficulties, I am sure that most manage to live rich and rewarding lives without resorting to further emotional or physical violence. I'd rather read about people with the mettle to do so."
2,Why bother?!,"I hated this book. Way too long, and totally unrealistic. I find the incident that took place was a ridiculous reason for a whole family to fall apart.Boring, boring and boring.With so many other great books out there, why spend time with this one?"
1,Don't say you haven't been warned!,"Words from earlier reviews like, ""torturous,"" ""boring,"" ""depressing,"" are apt descriptions of this book. Was Ms Oates' editor sleeping? This book needed a half dozen more rewrites in order to sift out the nuggets of good writing that get lost in so much angst. I did not accept the complete disintegration of this family. If you must read this book, I found that reading the chapter openings and closings and skipping over the middle sections helped me follow the storyline. But once I read to the finish, I was still baffled and disappointed with ""We Were the Mulvaneys."""
2,Could have been so good....,"I read this book for two reasons: i generally like books by joyce carol oates and as a former english teacher i like to keep up with what is being read by the masses and usually oprah's book club books are very popular. i was so disappointed. this book was way to long without the language being intresting. while the subject was good, and one we should look at over and over again in our country, (the subject i mean is one of denial) ms. oates just didn't do justice to the idea that grew in her head. the repetition of animals confused me. how was she using them in this story? were they supposed to be the common bond that kept the family connected? most of the characters were certainly nicer to their animals than to each other. was it a way to show their emotions? i don't know. very confusing. i finished the book because i always try to but i have to admit upon finishing my thoughts were not ""good one joyce."" rather they were ""whew, glad that's over."""
3,what were you thinking,"in a family, in any social group, what we are thinking, feeling, not saying, is the most important bit of information...how in the world could a family, even in the 70s, NOT talk about what had happened to one their own...how could the mother not pull her daughter into her chest and tell her it was not her fault....to be truthful, i cant imagine such ignorance...i was appalled...who loved who in this family?...the children can be forgiven of course...they simply ran from the weirdness...but the parents....what the hell were they thinking...only of themselves...why do such people have children in the first place"
1,Long Winded and Boring,This is not my type of book. She is long winded and her thought process is such that one thought is started at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page she is on to something else and the first thought was never answered. I have tried several times in the past to read her books. And her writing style and my reading style just don't match up. I thought the story line would be good. But its so fragmented that I lost interest.
1,Don't waste your time!,"At first, I wished I could give this book zero stars, thinking it had absolutely nothing to offer. However, I did at one time wish to finish reading the book, just to see if it EVER got better. After almost an entire year of letting it sit on the bottom of my nightstand pile while I found other books vastly more interesting, entertaining, and rewarding, I've finally given up on finishing the last >100 pages. It's just not worth the time.We Were the Mulvaneys is dismally depressing, without any apparent purpose. I think most people would be hard-pressed to find a single character for whom they felt any affection or lasting interest.I think it's notable that there are nearly 800 used and new copies for sale, starting at a penny. I paid $1 for my copy at the local library sale. The book is headed back there now."
2,Dissappointing...,"This book generated a lot of hype, due to being a Oprah book club book. I don't think it lived up to the hype. I found much of the plot somewhat unbelievable. I felt as though the reader never truly got to know any of the characters, nor did I grow to care or relate to any of them.Much of the book dragged, only to rush at the end to conclude the storyline and tie everything up."
1,Get To The Story Already,"I found this book to be very confusing. The author creates to many flash backs and after a while you really don't know what's really happening to any of the characters in the book. I know alot of people love animals and so do I, but did she have to go on and on talking about all the animals, who cares. This could have been a wonderfully told story if the author didn't drag on and on talking abouh nothing. I am still trying to finish the book, even though I am not happy with the book."
1,Absolute rubbish!,"What a horrible book! I love to read but getting through this book was nothing short of tedious. I kept waiting for it to get better . . . it never did. First of all, the structure of the chapters made the story move painfully slow. The book constantly back tracked to years past. It made it difficult to muster up any emotion for what was happening to the family because the emotion kept getting lost for me by the story lines changing. Secondly, I never ""took to"" any of the characters. In most books there is one character or another who readers can relate to or take a liking to. That never happened with this novel. And lastly, the sentence structure was poor which also made it difficult to read. Sorry, Ms. Oates. Better luck next time."
1,Put it down before finishing,2/3 through the book and I couldn't stand it any longer! I usually finish a book but it was torture.
1,"Oprah, please!","My last name is Mulvaney, so naturally I picked this up out of curiosity... Great name, terrible book. I love to read, and usually can't put a book down until it is finished, but this book moved so SLOWLY that I could hardly bear to finish it. I would get this from the public library if you MUST read it. Better have a cup of coffee ready."
3,Typical Oprah book,"The author writes beautifully in this book, and the first few pages instantly captivate the reader. After browsing through this at the book store and reading the plot summary on the back cover, I felt compelled to buy this, even though Oprah's books had been somewhat disappointing lately. This book did nothing to prove me wrong! The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because the plot line was promising enough and the writing was beautiful enough. However, this book seemed to drag on forever, was very depressing, seemed to have no point! The reader finds themselves hating every member of the family!! I found that I had to force myself to finish the rest, just to see what happened! The author tries to make the ending too happy to match with the depressing nature of the book. Oprah's books as of late has been all about women victims!! IT gets old."
3,show don't tell,"I looked forward to reading my first Oates novel because she is such an esteemed writer. And I loved her short story, ""Family"". So, I was thrilled when Oprah chose Oates as this month's pick.The character development in this novel is well done. However, one of the first things a writer learns is: ""show don't tell"". I believe this novel suffers from too much narration...either the book could have been cut by 100 pages, or some of the narration could have been turned into scenes that would bring us into the story rather than keeping us at a distance, especially as the family falls apart.I think I'll go back to Oates short stories..."
3,less tiresome than many Oates books,"Joyce Carol Oates is an amazingly prolific writer. Unfortunatly, for me, at least, the more I read of her, the less I like her. I find that her style of writing gets tiresome after a while. That said, I also found this book to be less grating than some of her other offerings. It's an interesting tale of what happens when a golden family's most golden child falls from grace, and Oates' writing style is more tolerable than usual. If you're only going to read one book by Joyce Carol Oates, it should be either this one or Dark Water."
4,She can create a world but she doesn't know cars . . .,"A fine book, with ""classic"" Oates ominousness, now offset with another vision at the end. But, like the person who noted that Corvettes don't have backseats, neither does a ""battery turn over"" when a key is turned in an ignition (somewhere in the text--forgive me for not nit-picking it to death to find the reference). If a car's batery is rotating, you have real problems. I do not fault the author--but she definitely deserves better editing than the manuscript received. I hope her editor at Dutton sees this."
1,depressed on the farm,Reading is a form of relaxation for me. I love getting caught up in characters and a new world. This book made me extremely depressed and angry. I felt it was NOT a realistic way of dealing with the problem of rape. I wanted to throttle every character in the book except the animals. Rape is real. You deal with it. And move on. For this to ruin everyone's lives was totally ludicrous. I realize we have problems in life but this book truly blew them up. It gave me a serious migraine. It might have been more interesting if the author did not go on and on and on about the most minute things . . .
4,Does This Really Happen?,"I am somewhat astonished with the speed in which I read this book. Two weeks, despite a full time job. And yet, I am troubled by one recurring issue: Does this really happen? Can a family so close, a mother so devoted, really spin so out of control where everyone abandons everyone else? All the kids abandoned the parents who abandoned each other and, in the end, ... well, I better not ruin it. I will reread this book someday. There is someting there about Christianity and forgiveness and Darwinism and science. Something worth a second read. I even liked the characters. But...really, can this happen?"
1,pointless tearing at the heartstrings,"This book is like a bad soap opera. Supposedly ""good"" people make completely incomprehensible choices in service of a poorly thought out plot.The character of Marianne was especially laughable - all the author's effort went into trying to make us feel bad for her sob story instead of painting a believable character. Marianne is the idealized martyr: never angry at the family that inexplicably turns against her. What planet was this girl from? What planet was the father from? It is hard to believe natural selection did not do away long ago with a gene pool without any noticable coping or reality-testing skills.The sad part is that Oates is actually a good writer. I'm not sure what possessed her to write and publish this pathetic tear-jerker."
2,an Oprah disappointment,"The primary appeal for me of Oprah's other recommendations has been strong, engrossing characterization. After reading ""I Know This Much is True"" I carried the main character around in my head for weeks afterwords. In this book, however, I never came to care at all for the characters. This was particularly frustrating when there were major plot turns (a family disowning a much beloved daughter) that made no sense to me based on the bits of information I'd oreviously gleened from the characters.I concur with another author who stated that the style of moving back in forth in time (which I enjoy in other books) was incredibly annoying in this book. I skipped ahead and skimmed significantly more than I have with any other book.Up to this point, I've felt confident that an Oprah recommendation meant a book I'd be engrossed and engaged in from cover to cover. Not this book."
1,Discouraging and sad,"Happy family eaten up and torn apart by teen daughter's rape.A bland read, totally forgettable, monotonous. Long and gloomy, little dialogue, tedious, overly descriptive.... Discouraging and sad."
3,We were the Mulvaneys,I thought that this was a good book. I felt that it was a bit too drawn out at times but it is well written. Definately a very sad story from beginning to end. I am glad I read it.
2,Just ok,I found this book to be very difficult to finish. I kept waiting for something more to happen. I couldn't understand why some chapters were even included. If you have a choice between this book and another one...I'd go for the other one.
2,BLAH!,"For all the hype on this book being a #1 bestseller for several months now, I thought I would have enjoyed it more. I can't even say I would recommend it to anyone!"
3,"cool characters, overheated setting","The four young characters, while a bit too perfect, were engaging; you rooted for them and hoped they'd make it through the tragedy as more mature folk.But Oates' descriptions of their farm and town and such were overwrought, that at times I wasn't sure if the book was supposed to be parody or not. There was scattered humor in its pages, but it was all-too-rare.The story of how a perfect family begins to unravel is an old one, and I'm afraid Oates' brought nothing new to the table in ""We Were the Mulvaneys."" Engaging characters can only go so far if there isn't a real concrete plot to stand on."
3,We Were the Mulvaneys,"Very depressing book, and I'm not sure why I even continued after ""it"" the event happens. Even though I'd tell you I didn't like it I read it in just a couple of days. So that must mean it at least kept my attention. The book is thought-provoking and a tragedy that might have been prevented if this family communicated. It's a good lessons learned for families everwhere. It reminded me of my family that has too many secrets. No one is allowed to talk about reality. This book would make a good book club discussion book."
3,Unhappily ever after...,"I kept hoping that dear old dad would come to his senses. Alas, he is doomed to hell. His kids are doomed to hate him (except Marianne) and his wife is...just doomed. Marianne is a modern day Joan of Arc. Forever breaking your heart and living in a dream world, you want to shake her and say ""STOP! Get on with your life!"" But you aren't allowed to understand her except as a religious icon. For me, the best part of the book is the last 100 pages when the family comes together again and Marianne is miraculously ""born again"". Joyce Carol Oates has a jaundiced eye view of life. Brilliant but sad."
5,The best American author of all times,"Since the 60's Joyce Carol Oates has been the paragon for American fiction writers, from books like Expensive People and Them. Now in a more modern novel Oates has not lost her touch in the least. As opposed to popular belief the family of the story is disgusting yet wholly realistic at the same time. Many people remarked that no parents could ever treat a daughter so horribly, yet Ive seen very similar situations handled just the same by parents of young adults that I knew. Around the world, and in America especially, parents can be amazingly appalling and Oates portrays this in this novel. Very few families are stable and Oates unmasks the veil of perfectness that permeates through mainstream thought. Thus her realism juxtaposed with an unbelievable situation in this novel is a complete success as per usual."
3,keep reading,"This book started out slowly and if it hadn't been a book club selection, I might have stopped reading. But I'm glad I finished it. Thinking back on the first chapters, I felt, after reading it all, that the family was nothing like we thought at first. I enjoyed the descriptions of the places, animals, etc. because I am originally from that area. Oates is a little wordy, however.I think it was about Patrick, who he was and how he discovered that...............And I loved Oates thought that what is unspoken in a family is the most important."
2,"tedious, frustrating and overwritten","Reading this book was an exercise in frustration. Oates takes three pages to describe an event that could have been summed up in two paragraphs. But beyond that, she never made it clear why the family fell apart. We saw how happily ""perfect"" they were prior to the tragic event (cutesy nicknames and all) and then how they fell apart at the seems afterwards. But we never saw WHY. That made the entire second half of the story almost implausible. By the time I got to the end, I was less concerned with what happened to the characters than I was with just FINALLY finishing the book."
2,Too long for such a frustrating story,"I had a difficult time finishing this book. The story could have been told in half as many words. I never came to care for any of the characters, they all seemed flawed and weak to the point that I didn't care what happened to them. The rambling style of the narrative is difficult to follow at times. During the first 100 pages I kept waiting for ""something to happen"" - but it never did. The end is too neat for such a messy book. I finished the book only as a challenge to myself."
3,Stop and Go - Had no Flow,"The premise of the story was good: A young man tells the stories and myths of his family. He explores how incidents and skeletons in the closet have an impact on family members and family life.I'd get really into one chapter, then have to force myself to read the next one."
1,The worst book I ever managed to finish,"Let me say first that the story itself was interesting enough to keep me reading. But it was so badly written that I was able to skim pages of drivel -- long, rambling descriptions that did nothing to advance the story. One example in particular that stands out in my mind was several pages describing the clocks in the house, all the clocks, and how much Marianne loved the clocks and the various sounds they made. Whatever symbolic significance those clocks had could have been expressed in a paragraph instead of 2-3 pages of rambling.I thought the made-for-TV movie starring Beau Bridges and Blythe Danner was much better than the book.This is the first Oates book I've read. I won't be eager to read any more of her novels."
2,Tiring,"I found this book very tiring. The endless, boring, minute detail made the book twice as long as it needed to be. Although there was an interesting storyline there, it kept getting lost in the shuffle. I was just plain tired by the time I finally finished it."
2,We Were The Mulvaneys,"What happened??? Did Ms. Oates quit writing this two-thirds of the way through and let someone else finish this book? Several of the characters were set on a major collision course and she just dropped the ball! That happily ever after ending was a major letdown. I thought Judd might commit a murder; perhaps Marianne wasn't raped after all; maybe she did instigate that sexual encounter; maybe it was with Michael Sr. since he wanted her banished; what mother banishes a daughter that's been raped?! Give me a break. This story could have been riviting until the last page, but I had to force myself to read the last third of the book. Dullsville!"
1,Like Pulling Teeth,"I know of no other way to describe this book, forcing myself to read it was one of the hardest things I've done lately. Would rather spend an afternoon in the dentist chair."
4,GRIPPING STORY,"J C Oates makes you see vividly in your mind's eye the landscape of this Novel., she is so descriptive. The story was a little slow to start, but gripped your imagination as the story unfolded. It was heartbreaking how the family disintegrated, and there was no putting this book down until the last page, as you really wanted to know how this family survived and came through."
3,"Hard to get through, nice ending","This book is the story of so many families that go through really tough times. Alcoholism is the main topic, always on the horizon, but brought to full force by a child being hurt and no recourse. I found the storyline to be very hard to stay interested in and the ending, while very sweet, to be unrealistic. This is my first book by this author, not sure I will read another one soon."
3,an excellent read,"This book by Oates is a very unusual book. It has captivating characters who all react differently to a critical event in the family history, one that happens to one of the characters. This book is an excellent read and I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Disappointing,I did not think this lived up to the hype. I found it lacked a strong story and strong characters. I would not recommend it.
2,Verbal Diarrhea,"I have read another book from Oprah's Book Club and it was great, but this book isn't.I found there was too much ""filler"" thoughout the book and I kept asking myself ""Did that last sentence make any sense?"" and ""Was that a fragment?""I was also miffed about the fact that the book was going into great detail about something integral to the book's plot and then it veers on a tangent about something else.(this book seemed mixed up in too many places)However, I did manage to read the entire book, and it was an easy read. I am used to the writing style of Jane Austen, so the style of writing in Joyce's book was a bit of a shock.(real big slap on the face for me!)"
1,Oprah's recommendations gone sour!,"This is the second book I bought based on Oprah's recommendations, the other being House of Sand and Fog and I found them both to be studies in and of depression. Unresolved characters and plots make both these books difficult to read. They end leaving you disgusted that you spent the time reading these nightmares. I am really disappointed in these recommendations. I wonder who really reads these books to make the recommendations in the first place. P.S. The best book I have read lately is Ahab's Wife."
1,I hate this book!,"This was the most depressing book I've read in the past year. The parents were awful people and the children lost souls. I would not recommend this book to anyone.I'm no longer taking Oprah's recommondations, without other input."
1,We Were the Mulvaneys,"I have read 22 books in the last three months from cover to cover, but I have to tell you I got halfway through this one and had to stop. I was told the biginng was slow but I found the middle was even slower. The characters don't make sense. So I stopped out of sheer boredom. I may pick it up again and try to finish it, but for now I am moving on!"
3,"A Good Book, but....","The real test, to me, of whether or not a book is ""good"" is whether it evokes in me emotion, any kind of emotion--love, hate, fear, horror, disgust, sadness. And so this is a Good Book. Indeed, Oates evoked all of these emotions here. But when a writer does anything to annoy me or take my attention away from the characters, the train of story is broken. I must substract stars because the narrator goes about telling this story as an omniscient presence, being everywhere at once and knowing the minds of every other character in the book. Judd cannot possibly know all the things he tells us. He wasn't there in the rest of the family's most secret thoughts, and yet he relates them to us. If you can forget this, you'll have a good read. If details like this bother you, you'll find the read a little less entertaining."
1,tedious,"I've greatly enjoyed most of Oprah's Book Club books, but this one has been a huge disappointment. I've never read so many words to describe so little action or emotion. Some books you're disappointed to finish, but with this one you keep plodding along toward the end, and then wonder why you bothered."
2,Suicide Inducing,"This book is one of the most depressing novels I have ever read. Yes, it is very well written. Oates is a masterful story teller. But the main characters, the Mulvaneys, (with the exception of Marianne) are the most self-absorbed, shallow, deluded and cruel family members you could ever meet. Their actions are inexplicable and unforgivable. Possibly most annoying, the epilogue is so different from the rest of the book and so out of character for this family that it has the tacked-on feel of a bad Hollywood ending. It would have been much more realistic if the book had ended with the episode before the epilogue. If you need to be convinced that life is a dark lonely place and that you can't depend on anyone, including your closet friends and family, this book is for you. If you need a reason to commit suicide, this book could be it. Otherwise, steer clear of the Mulvaneys."
2,We Were the One-Dimensional Mulvaneys,"I could barely make it throught this book. If Ms. Oates had spent as much time on character development as she did with the excruciating details of the Mulvaney's homestead, she might have had something. The farm animals have more personality than the people. Whether it's the cheerfully shallow mother, or the superficially gregarious, loving father who turns into an alcoholic ogre, I just couldn't feel anything for these people.Then, to top it all off, the author wraps everything up neatly in a one-chpater epilogue that seems to ignore the magnitude of everything else that's gone on in the book. It seemed false and jarring after the agony of a book rife with boring details."
2,American Novel 101,"Usually, a master of the craft of writing fiction, in We Were the Mulvaneys, Oates has created a textbook with which to teach the elements of fiction. I felt manipulated by this book. All the trite devices were included to jerk the reader's emotional strings. The characters did not really breathe but went through their paces. Like a painter working from photographs, Oates seems to be working from popular media, reworking tried and true images. A dark and usually uncompromising writer, Oates appears to be toying with the traditional family saga. The final chapter was obviously added on to make the book more palatable and marketable. This plot and these characters needed a less cerebral and calculating author. Had Oates more of an emotional investment in this book, she would never have written the final chapter. Fewer books would have sold but at least the book would have had more integrity."
2,Wonderfully boring!!!,"I read 31 pages of this mess and couldn't go on. The author didn't give me anything to hold my interest. I wanted to read it because Oprah raved about it...but well, Ms Oates' work is boring, the writing disjointed, the style a pain. No thanks, I will read something else."
2,Disappointing,"This book appeals to literary critics because it is full of overblown prose. There were several times, as I read, that I wondered why a particular chapter was there in the first place - it added nothing and wasted my time. I do not believe that this family would manage to overcome its traumas in the way the book has them doing so - the way in which each person evolved and splintered and eventually changed was not believable in any case save, perhaps, for Marianne...."
3,We Were The Mulvaneys,This is the first time I have read one of Joyce Carol Oates books. Though I found the story to be entertaining I do feel that there could have been a lot taken out to make the flow alittle better. It seemed to drag on in parts and then all of a sudden get interesting again. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the time to just sit and read because it may take you awhile to get through it.
4,a book to relate to...,"I found this a book that intimately describes ""normal"" family interactions that seem so functional.Then, when a significant challenge comes upon the family, dysfunctional responses can quickly start a cascade of consequences from which it seems impossible to recover. family love and connections are a strong force and this book brings you that optimism in the face of things-gone-terribly wrong."
3,Not a light read,"This isn't a light, fluffy book. It deals with the disintegration of a family. While it is beautifully written, I was looking forward to the end of it, hoping for a satisfying resolution. I would recommend this to friends, but with a warning! Buy it if you want to be engrossed in a novel."
1,Couldn't finish it...,"I tried on several different occasions to read this book, but lost interest each time. Very disappointing..."
1,don't even bother.,"I was forced to read this book for a college English course and everyone (except two people) hated this book. One of the worst books I have ever read in my life.This book was WAY too discriptive. She had to descibe everything to the smallest crack on the wall. What's worse, the story, characters and plot were unrealistic, boring, and the way the family handles the daughter getting raped made me think what planet this family lives on.The narrator (who is supposed to be the youngest son) is nonexistant in the story. Plus the ending was a real disapointment. I think Oakes was trying too hard to come up with a happy ending.In short; don't bother reading this book."
1,outrageous e-book price,I'm new to kindle but the price of this e-book was unbelievable. I'm able to buy a hard copy for a penny but the electronic book is 12.00. Purchasing a Nook may be in my future after all.
2,Not for me,It was hard to read a book about a family self-destructing when it was so unnecessary. What's the point?
3,So what!,This book was okay until I read a non-fiction book about the Viet Nam war. Then I ranked it low on the totem pole.
1,It's Driving Me Crazy,Too Too flowery. Enough with all the prose; get to the story! I can't see why other people like this book so much. I'm almost half way through and find myself skipping over parts just so I can get to the meat of the story.
1,Not what I expected!,"This was the first Oprah pick I've read. It may be the last. At times the story was hard to follow due to not knowing in what time of the youngest's child's memory this was coming from. I read a review on the back cover, and from it assumed, things would work out OK. The dysfunction is very real in many families today; however, I feel it would be better if we could have some meat to handle the process of healing. I would not recommend this book!"
1,Disappointing,"Interesting subject matter, but buried in many endless chapters of monotonous rhetoric."
1,The wost novel I've ever read,The book developed the characters and the setting well but the book had absolutely no climax. Basically it was a literary stream of consciousness with half of its content being irrelevant tangential information. I threw the book in the trash when I was done with it.
2,We Were the Mulvaneys,"I was very dissappointed in this novel, especially the end that led you up a mountain and the dropped you instead of reaching the top. The story jumped around and was poorly written and too detailed in ways that were unnecessary."
1,Depressing,"This was the most depressing book I've ever read. I don't see any redeeming value to it. This ""perfect family"" failed when it came to the test."
1,Awful,"I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted my money. I don't think I'm that demanding, but whew! I am on page 153 and can't force myself to go further. Life is too short. I am vaguely interested in how the family handles the crisis, but can't wade through the inconsequential stuff. Get to the point! I am waiting to see what happens. Read Jodi Picoult instead for some great reading."
1,An Unbelievable Family,"Although I haven't read Oates for years i was an ardent fan at one point in my life. ""We were the Mulvaney's"" was a huge disappointment. Oates still shows her amazing descriptive skills,but I did not believe one character in this book.I did not believe that the parents presented the way they were in the beginning of the book would ever have reacted to the plight of their beloved daughter in that way...especially the mother. Oates does not prove her point that lovable quirky people can turn into clueless monsters in the face of trauma. Thumbs down!"
2,A Very Long Tale of Woe,"This story was soooooooo long that about 3/4 of the way through I was thinking ""enough already"" ~~~ I enjoyed the picturesque farm country and the image of ""small town life"" BUT all I can say is: how times have changed!! I can't believe the lack of emotional support given to the rape victim (the Mulvaney daughter) in this book. It was hard for me to imagine parents, especially the mother, feeling the ""shame"" for themselves and doing absolutely nothing to help their daughter. Although, the book semi held my interest and I did finish it, it was pretty slow going at times.. I closed the book and said ""so long"" !!"
1,Too Much Detail - Never a Point,"I too finally made it through the book. I kept waiting for a point to it, but never found one. I could not believe that any parents would treat their daughter the way Marianne was treated. It was painful to read right up until the last page. P.S. I like almost all of Oprah's picks, but NOT this one!"
2,Probably The Most Depressing Book I've ever Read,"This book was SO depressing. Also,I was so upset at the way the parents treated the daughter by banishing her after SHE had been a victim. I found it especially unbeleivable thet the mother, who was portrayed as so loving and strong could turn her back on her child when she needed her most. Also,Oates style of writing in long, long run on sentences was extremely irritating."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK,"I've just rediscovered Joyce Carol Oates after decades of reading award winning novels. And I soo Loved the Mulvaneys! I literally fell in love with this family, each charcter so beautifully developed. Oates understanding of human behavior and emotions....and how each is described and characterized. I cried at the end....which I rarely do.I feel as if I lived with this family's tragedies and triumphs...BEAUTIFUL!!!!! If you prefer a ""fast"" plot....don't bother. If you appreciate the minute descriptions of charcters and their environment you will love it!"
3,We were the Mulvaneys,"Being an avid reader of all types of books, I eagerly anticipated reading another of Oprah's picks. I am only half way through and have been laboring for more than a week. Oates feels the need to drone on and on, somewhat off track, while I am wanting more from each character, something redeeming to connect me to them, but it hasn't happened. So far, I haven't felt the compulsion to pick it up to see what happens like I do with others great reads. After reading some of the other reviews I realize I am not alone. Definitely lacks the ""page-turner"" status other picks have been."
4,A Family Undone,"Denial and dysfunction tears apart an American family in Joyce Caorol Oates' We Were the Mulvaneys. Set in 1970's upstate New York, the tale centers around the Mulvaneys - a family who is living the American dream of wealth and prominence on their own little slice of heaven, High Point Farm. Using her considerable gift for visceral prose, Oates paints a painful portrait of the fall of the Mulvaneys after the rape and subsequent exile of their ""perfect"" daughter. Oates' understanding potrayal of violence and its depersonalizing effects compels the reader to stay with the Mulvaneys -to empathize with their defects and come to a place of forgiveness with the entire clan. This is Oates at her best: holding a mirror up to show our strengths and vulnerablilities."
4,Down and Out on the Farm,"Is it possible that such a strong, capable family could disintegrate over date rape? Yep - I guess in J.C. Oatesland it happens. In the 1990s I suppose everyone would be in intensive family therapy, but this novel is set in a time when rape did reflect on the victim. I disagree with readers who have said the family was just too perfect for the first 100 pages. Haven't we all known of families filled with high achievers?My disappointment with the book was that Judd was not as strongly characterized as his brothers and sister. In spite of that, this novel was a page-turner. Reading Oates' books makes me feel as though I've picked up a rock from the garden and looked underneath. In other words, she writes great fiction."
3,A very detailed book-Good memorization skills required,"This was my first Oates book, but not my last. I choose this book to read as my junior research novel, and I am satisfied with my decision to an extent. Her method of writing is very enthrolling, while at the same time you needed to have a large enough mental capacity to be able to memorize the WHOLE thing. She did so much flashback in her novel, that if you forget one event, you have to go back and search for the event to be able to continue the story! And, 8 PAGES OF HOW TO GET TO AN IMAGINARY FARM?!?!?! Geez, get a clue! I was not overly impressed with Mrs. Oates, but I am willing to give her another chance. First impressions can be misleading."
4,What an emotional ride...,"I thought this book was unbelievable in the fact that the characters were so real! I loved and hated the charaters at the same time. I think that without question Joyce Carol Oates knows how to write a incredible book. Why is it incredible? I think any book is great when you honestly feel you know the character and you either want to be their friend or kill them!This story is about a very close family who are tradgically tore apart by an incedent , that was obviously to much for them to take. I highly recommend this book is you love stories of families that go through love, pain, heartach and survival. I will only say that this book will make you smile and then be so mad you can't stand it!!! Read this it's a great book!"
4,Very disturbing...vintage Oates!,"While the beginning was a bit slow, I eventually found myself glued to the pages screaming (in my head) at the characters response to the 'rape.' How very sad, to lose happiness in so many lives. How very Oates to dissect their pain to the very core. If you want a happy feel-good book, skip this one. If you want good literature and a disturbing tale, snap it up!"
4,"Good selection, but a little slow at times","this is probably the saddest book I've ever read. After Marianne's date rape at the age of 16, the Mulvaney's life totally and completely unravels. I think their life must have been unstable from the beginning, personal scars hidden underneath the outward ""happy-family"" persona. This book chronicles their life from youngest son Judd's birth until middle-age..from how the father, Mike, became a raging alcoholic and separated himself from the family, the mother Corinne tried her hardest to keep everyone together but was falling apart herself, and how Marianne moved around the country to try and escape the memories that shattered her life. From a seedy college co-op in Pennsylvania to marrying a veterinarian, readers begin to crave a happy ending. This novel, breaking your heart and then healing it once again, chronicles the life and times of the Mulvaneys."
2,Talk about veering off the subject!!,"I have read most of Oprahs recent books and loved them. This one is the exception. I couldn't read beyond page 40 because she writes about an event and then gets sidetracked and goes off for pages and pages about another detail. The trick is to keep you in suspense but I felt it extremely frustrating. I never was able to find out what happens to the daughter because it probably isn't until page 200! I felt like I was talking to one of those people that will tell a story, build it up, go off on different sub-stories and then finally gets to the end and you are so happy that the story is over that you want to make a point to not carry on a conversation with that person again. This book reminds me of the John Irving style of writing and if you like his stuff you may like this."
3,So sad...,"The Mulvaneys seemed to me a very disfunctional family in crisis. The optimism in me hopes that most families would handle a similar tragedy by coming together, rather than falling apart.I found the plot a bit slow - mainly because I kept waiting for the silver lining. I truly sympathized for the characters that Joyce Carol Oates created, but I just can't call this book one of my favorites."
5,"A ""Perfect Family "" Experiences Pain Through Frustration","Joyce Carol Oates has motivated me to seek out more of her work through "". . . The Mulvaneys."" She has somehow caused me to run the gamut of feelings from admiration to disgust to compassion for the entire Mulvaney family . I was in turn, intriqued, depressed and hopeful for these tragic individuals!"
4,"Incredible writing, disturbing story","Like most of Oates' work, her latest novel is not so much hard to understand as it is hard to read. Her writing is often powerfully beautiful, but the subjects she chooses to describe are painful. Roughly three hundred out of four hundred and fifty pages are devoted to the consequences of a rape that tears apart a perfect family. It is easy to criticize the characters for the way they deal with their daughter and sister's trauma; perhaps because their reactions are not constructive, it is also easy to get frustrated with the characters and even the novel itself. However, the novel ultimately redeems itself by proving that a loving family can indeed overcome just about anything. A good read with a meaningful moral, but it hits difficult spots along the way."
1,Too much detail!!,This was one of the worst novels I have ever read. Oates goes on and on with so much detail and jumps around so much that it is hard to stay interested. I gave up after Part I.
2,boring...,"Her worst book in years. Full of stereo-types and unpleasantcharacters who deserve what they get. And what they get isn't much.Angst: been there, done that. The characters are completelyunsympathetic in that their absolute selfishness andnarrow-minded values make caring about them not possible. IfI met these people I wouldn't like them so reading about themis not at all interesting.It seems JCO has burnt herself out. When she's not writingabout people dismembering eachother she is writing aboutboring, obnoxious people. Maybe she needs a break..."
1,One of the worst books I have ever read!,"I absolutely hated this book! I could not believe that the father in this story completely ruins his entire life and the life of his family just because his daughter got raped. I hated all the wimpy characters in this book also. None of them were believable and they never redeem themselves. I honestly wanted to just put this depressing book down a million times, but once I start something, I finish it. I am so sorry I wasted my precious time on,as another reviewer said, ""a total waste of paper."" I have enjoyed so many Oprah picks. She really let me down on this one!"
5,Brilliant!,"Even if you didn't like this book, and it was an emotionally draining story, how anyone can belittle Oates' writing is beyond me. She is the best. Someone noted that these characters had no depth. Are you kidding?? They had so much depth that it was sometimes difficult to take in. For anyone who is not afraid of serious fiction and doesn't insist on happily-ever-after, this is a must-read!"
5,"JCO spins a fascinating, disturbing tale, again.","I loved this book....Once again, Oates draws the reader helplessly into the lives, secrets, dreams and nightmares of her characters. While reading ""We Were The Mulvaneys"", (in 2 days!) I felt as if these were people I knew...or could know. Oates' descriptions paint stellar portraits of these Mulvaneys...the reader comes to know each intimately, feel for them, and with them. The reader turns the page, even when there is supper to cook, or laundry to be hung, wondering, ""What will happen to these people?""The din of this family's life rings true, as does their decline in the face of tradgedy. The reader looks on, like by-standers at a fire, grateful for not being burned, but feeling the intense heat from the flames.In the end, the book closes on a happier note, unlike much of Oates' work in the past. This is one story, one set of characters that I wll remember, long after the book is placed on a shelf."
3,Pathetic,"I thought this was a good book and entertaining, but it was ruined on how naive Maryann was. I thought it was so wrong what happened to the daughter and how they shipped her away and ended almost all communication. What mother that truly loves her daughter that much, would just send her off because her father can't stand to look at her. Maryann never got mad or hated her parent's for treating her that way? Very unrealistic. MaryAnn was a very weak character and apparentley very stupid for letting her family basically disown her."
2,Doesn't quite add up,"I'm a medium-sized fan of Oates—American Appetites and Because it is Bitter, Because it is My Heart are favorites. But this saga misses the boat a bit. It never seems logical, or even probable that the father would exile his daughter for being raped. Though this book is set in the 1970s, it feels more like a 1950s morality tale. It takes that ""things fall apart, the center cannot hold"" thing too far, making a seemingly ideal family go from Leave it to Beaver perfection to the mean, wacked out folks they become due to one incident...terrible as it may have been. ... I kept reading and reading and was left dissapointed by the end. Like some romance novelist, Oates sews everything neatly up. If the Mulvaneys got that messed up by the earlier rape, they probably won't keep their stuff together either."
3,Couldn't get past the insult,"As an intelligent, successful and proud graduate of a New York State university, I was thoroughly insulted by Ms. Oates repeated and ignorant slams on New York State universities and colleges (and, indeed, state universities in general). Her only references to state universities were made in derogatory terms and applied only to characters who weren't all that bright or who admitted their attendance in an embarrassed manner. Her bright characters, of course, attended Ivy League schools. A writer of her stature should not have had to bow to such ignorant cliches. I was very disappointed and have discouraged many a person from honoring her degradation by reading her book."
1,LONG AND DREARY! SPARE YOURSELF!,"If you think this book will improve as you turn the pages, do yourself a favor and PUT IT DOWN NOW! I've read many, many books in my life and I have NEVER read such a dreary story; not dramatic, or tragic, or compelling, simply dreary. None of the characters seem to have any inner strength, you will wish you could go straight to High Point Farm and shake them all up! The prose is LENGTHY, to put it kindly, and trails off into unknown territory just when you think you might be getting somewhere! UGH. Unfortunately, it took me almost 300 pages to realize that the plot would not EVER take a turn for the better, and I felt compelled to stick it out. A complete waste of time."
2,Oates Seeks Revenge,"Ms. Oates has a deep seated contempt for the middle American family. With this story Oates expresses her contempt by concocting a family that for all their initial outward success cannot connect with, much less help, each other. The author believes that families cannot overcome obstacles and heal from their wounds. She depicts middle American families as jealous, competitive, and especially from a Mother to daughter, unloving."
1,Disappointing,"This book crawled along at a snail's pace. I kept waiting for it to pick up steam, but it never did."
1,A Huge Disappointment!,"This book was so boring and superficial that I quit reading it about halfway through. That was a first for me as I am an avid reader and usually enjoy Oprah's Book Club selections. This one, though, was really off the mark and very disappointing. The characters were never fully developed, the story line was way too draggy, tedious, and predictable and Ms. Oates' use of punctuation, especially her constant overuse of hyphenated adjectives, drove me NUTS! This is the first work of Joyce Carol Oates that I have read, and I must say I was quite surprised at her lack of ability to write a crisp, compelling story and her writing style in general seemed amateurish. My advice to anyone contemplating reading this book is don't waste your time, there are much better books out there to curl up with."
1,Unredeeming; implausible; unjustified,"I keep thinking I ought to like J. C. Oates's books. I keep buying them. I keep reading them. After this one, I'm going to quit.Unredeeming and unlikeable characters except for the rage-filled brother, the only one who sees what's happening.Implausible plot.Utterly unjustified, sugar-coated ending.Waaaaaaay too long. Oates needs an editor in the worst way, someone to tell her when to STOP.Dreadful...I'm over it."
1,A Frustrating and Unlikely Story,"I started out really liking this book and all it's quirky characters. I enjoyed Ms. Oates style filled with 'wordy' descriptions. But then she vears off in this totally unbelievable direction and she lost me. I just can not believe this fun, happy, highly affectionate family would react to the daughters rape in the way described. It was truely infuriating and I came to hate these parents, esp the Mother. It may have made some sense if it had taken place in the 20's or 30's but in the 70's women were no longer to be blamed! I really can't understand the choices Ms. Oates made and though I saw it through to the end it held no truth or satsifaction. It is too bad, I really wantd to like this book, the only realistic character in the book was the cat, Muffin."
2,HELP! I'M TRAPPED IN THIS BOOK & CAN'T GET OUT!,"i've only read a few of oprah's book club books but last month she raved so about this one, i had to read it. like another reviewer said.. why couldn't the author just get to the point! i believe it was page 130 when you FINALLY find out for sure what happen that becomes the pivotal point of the story.i'm hating this book and i'm hating the fact that i'm stuck in it. but i keep reading hoping it will get better. its not and i'm ready to move on. i'm not a quitter but time is too precious for the frustration of ""we were the mulvaneys"". (i gave 2 stars simply because 1 star seemed petty... so the author gets 2 stars for effort)"
2,"My first Oates book, and my last Oates book....","I was amazed that some of what I read in the dustcover blurbs compared this writing to Dickens and James. If this was representative of Oates' writing I won't be reading her again. The characters were without depth. The situations were created without subtlety. And I found the shifting point of view irritating: if the youngest son would have been the consistent storyteller the telling of the story might have been improved. Had I seen ""Day-glo"" once more I'd have thrown the book away!Maybe it would have been less tedious if it had been around 150 pages shorter."
1,Please spare yourself - don't buy this book,"This is definitely the worst Oprah book I've ever read. Not one of the characters has a single redeeming characteristic. I wanted to slap some sense into all of them. Had there been one single person in the book that you felt some sense of bonding with it would have made a difference. I read the whole book because I hate not to finish something I've started, but it was dreadful and I hated every minute of it. Usually when a book is good you hate to get to the end because you'd like to see the characters you've grown to appreciate continue. Not so this book, I was so glad to be finished with it.Spare yourself - don't buy it or get started on it."
4,A Modern-Day Reprise of Dreiser,"This book is hauntingly familiar to Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy."" Four children, their parents and a marriage are all sacrificed on the pyre of the parents' self-perceived image in the community and Joyce Carol Oates is an author who is powerful enough to make us feel their initial disbelief and subsequent pain following ""the incident."" I found Michael Sr. to be the most dislikable character because he used the rape of his daughter to justify his own very despicable behavior when he was needed the most and the daughter to be the character most deserving of our compassion. This is a book that will make its readers take a good, hard look at the depth of their own meaningful relationships to see if they would survive a devestation of the magnitude suffered by the Mulvaneys. This book is about people who prefer to maintain appearances at all cost and the cost is, indeed, very dear."
2,"If This Is Reality, Then I Live In An Alternate Universe","First of all I like JCO's writing, but this book stunned me with its characters, all of whom seem to make the most horrible decisions in life. I was frustrated and angry with every single one of them all through the book. I cannot believe that people would respond in this manner to the ordeal of the daughter. I am sad to finish many books because I know that I will miss the characters that I have just spent hours with. When I finished this book I had a different feeling. I said good riddance to all of them."
5,A heartrending portrayal...,"Joyce Carol Oates, one of the most prolific authors to date, has painted the picture of a storybook world gone terribly wrong. Her devotion to the true feeling and emotion of each of the Mulvaneys lends an aire of authenticity and truth to this story that would otherwise not be present. Marianne Mulvaney's struggle into womanhood and her heartwrenching emotion over a family lost depict a tale of so many young girls - of so many families - and provide the book with the ability to resonate with so many people today.READ It! This is one of the best books I have ever read! Emotional, endearing, and unique. Joyce Carol Oates has outdone herself this time."
4,"The consequences of ""family secrets"".","This is the heartbreaking story of a family whom on the outside seemed to have it all. They were the envy of all that knew them. The sucessful busines-man Father, the doting Mother, three sons and a beautiful daughter. There would be a single event that would blow the family apart. It's a study of how a snowball turned into an avalanche, one secret led to another, and another, and how each family member dealt with the incident that changed their family for ever. This book was long but worth the endeavor."
4,An indepth look into family ties...,"I really enjoyed this book. After reading Blonde, also by Joyce Carol Oates, I had expected this book to be like Blonde--racier, more risque I suppose. However, We Were the Mulvaneys was more of a family saga that really dove into what made the members of the Mulvaney family tick. What had appeared to be a perfect family was not strong enough to withstand the rape of Marianne, which leads us to discover all the things that really go on inside the heads of the Mulvaneys. An enjoyable read that you don't have to think too hard for, but a lot above cheap romance novels!"
3,Could of been an excellent story.,"When I read the back cover of this book, It sounded like it was going to one I could not put down. While the story line is good, every little detail is described, did I really need directions to the farm?! Also I wish I could have gotten to know the characters better, they were not described very well, except for the father, he seemed to be obsessed with what other people thought about him, and We never really found out why this was.I wish the kids lives were better explained. How deeply hurt and terrorized the daughter was after the crime was committed on her, and more about how the brothers felt. An OK read if you can get by all the fluff."
1,Boring Boring Snooze Snooze,This book had potential but quickly lost any fire it had from the start....I will be more careful when choosing which Oprah books I will read from here on out. I was looking forward to this book and was disappointed..big time!
1,Slow and drawn out....,"This is my first book from Oprah's Book Club, and I was very disappointed. After hearing Oprah rave about it, I felt I had to read it. But I had to force myself to finish it. I thought maybe it was just me, so I gave it to my husband to read, he felt the same way. In a conversation with my sister-in-law, she had also read it and did not like it either. We all thought it was slow, slow, slow...."
1,"Major, Major Error in Fact - No Backseat in a Corvette!","Next to the last paragraph on page 155 of softcover edition: Marianne refers to the ""shadowy backseat of the Corvette."" This is where she was supposedly raped.To my knowledge, there has never been a Corvette with a backseat."
1,Oprah who?,"Too bad she has recommemded this book. It may be worthy but I'll no longer waste my time reading anything she recommends after, The House of Sand & Fog, Beloved and The 5 People you meet in Heaven. None of those books had any usefull information or were entertaining. But they did bring suicidal tendencies forward in my mind. 1 person in our book club was chosing the books 9 out of 10 dropped out and will no longer read anything Oprah endorses."
1,Time for a better book.,"I'm a third of the way through the book, and page after page, I keep wondering when the story will go somewhere, when the characters will move me, when will the storyline develop. It's become a tedious read, as I have no feeling - like or dislike - for the characters. Perhaps because none of them are believable, and there's a shallowness that oozes through most of them. I finally decided I need to find out if other readers had my experience, so I came online to read some reviews. Now I know it's time to move on, to pick up the next book on my shelf, and donate The Mulvaneys to the thrift shop. The last book I read was Wally Lamb's ""I Know This Much Is True"", and while I know that's a hard act to follow, life is too short to waste it on this kind of writing."
1,We Were the Mulvaneys,I have never before read a book where I actually did not care what happened to any of the characters. It left me angry and empty. A total waste of time and energy.
1,"Boring, boring, boring","This is a thick book and the only two reasons I picked it up at a rummage sale were it was 50 cents and it had been one of Oprah's selections. Within an hour of reading, I had made it to the middle of the book. I hate overused descriptions so I skim through them. I skimmed so much that I almost had the book done when I couldn't tolerate it anymore. The story has been done better by more and has come to the point it is overdone. I sold it in our garage sale for 50 cents. I lost an hour of time but I didn't lose any money. I will not be reading this author again."
1,Too lengthy,"I got to the third chapter and gave up. This was way to lenghty with detail of things that I could understand wher the author was going with this. I was recommended this novel with a warning that it was a tradgic story. Since I enjoy reading heavy conflict, and coupled with it being an Oprah pick, I thought for sure this would grab me. But it didn't. I would recommend this to those who don't mind reading multiple pages on dear, etc. Otherwise, skip it for a more enjoyable read!"
1,Better Title: We Were Weirdos from Another Planet,"This book was so ridiculous and uninteresting, I couldn't even believe it. All of the characters were greatly underdeveloped, and while Oates attempted to tell this ""story"" from the perspective of the youngest Mulvaney, she failed terribly. This book is supposed to be the youngest boy's attempt at writing the history of his family. However, within the first twenty pages the one and only conflict for the Mulvaneys begins, yet Oates totally underdevelops everything and makes everything just plain uninteresting. There was truly nothing tragic about this book except for the fact that it was published and hyped up by Oprah to make it worse. Take my advice and do not waste any money on this book -- if you're that curious, go to the library, I'm sure they'll have a ton available."
2,Why would anyone finish this book????,"Even more importantly, why did someone make a tv movie off it? This family appears to be close-knit, loving, and rich in faith but a catastrophe - when the daughter is brutally raped - tears it all apart. The father becomes hateful, abusive, and cold, the mother wrings her hands and cries but stands by and lets her daughter be victimized yet again. How can any reader have sympathy for ""parents"" like this who are anything but loving? This ""loving"" family punishes the victim. I had no sympathy whatsoever for these characters and found myself hoping the dad would get offed and mom too for her spineless lack of mothering when her child needed it most. The author's purple prose detracts from the story as well. Can't recommend this one at all."
2,we were the mulvaneys,"a dull read. tv movie was much better, guess i should have watched the movie and skipped the book. usually i like oates' writing, but not this time"
2,Abridged cut way to much,The book is quite good but the abridged audio cuts way to much of the flavor of the story and looses the characters motivations. Abridged books are in my opinion a waste but this one is a bigger waste that most.
4,This book resonates...,"Anytime a book embeds itself in my mind; anytime a book leaves me ANGRY at certain characters and has me crying for others; then I know it's found a place with me.We Were the Mulvaneys is just such a book. It is about the nature of humanity. It is about coping and forgiving. It clearly illustrates that a happy ending is a matter of perspective; that our perception of LIFE itself is totally a matter of perspective.If you like to get *into* the characters in the books you read, you'll love this book. Character development is very deep and each character becomes real during the reading and long after."
1,Not worth it!!!,"I was so disappointed in this book! Reading generally brings me great relaxation, but not with this book. I could not believe how the case of rape was handled and how the rapist was dealt with. This book is 450 pages long and could be 200. The author went on and on about trivial things. I continued to read the book thinking it would get better, but it never did. For those who have not read this yet, don't waste your time or money."
2,A Rather Frustrating Read,"Although the story is captivating, it just takes forever for Ms. Oates to tell it. The reader ends up knowing more detail about the characters than they probably know about themselves. After wading through it all, the ending is rather rushed and disappointing."
3,"Fine, but no 'Brothers K'","I picked up a copy of this book at a library sale before I knew it was an Oprah book. I tend to avoid the Oprah books because I find them preachy (though I admittedly read and enjoyed several of them before they were Oprah books.) Though this wasn't preachy, it seemed to me a less interesting and far less funny version of David James Duncan's brilliant study of family (in pretty much the same time period) 'The Brothers K.' It wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't really that good. It was often disengaging, which made it tedious. There are far better works to spend 450 pages reading."
5,We Were Them-Mulvaneys,"It is a wonderful book that says a lot about the human condition, at least I think. Disfunctional families, etc. And how it can all come back together. I cried at times reading this book. The sadness carried over until Oates brought everyone together in the end. I saw the Movie, which was not too bad as movies go. JC Oates is a great writer, and I think this is one of her best for the masses. It's just a wonderful story that says an awfull lot about life, and how preciously fraduel (sp?)it is for all of us.It's a good read - Joyce Carol Oates is a great writer.Barry"
5,Rich in beautiful language,"I listened to the book on cd, and I must say, although I enjoyed it and felt the actor did a great job, I missed actually reading the language used by Oates throughout the book.She is, apparently, a master of the written word (this is my first Oates book).It was a pleasure to read (okay, hear). I typically do not like heavy description in fiction, but I actually found myself enthralled with the scenery and characterization because it was just so enjoyable to hear the words Oates put together.If you are the type of person who gets excited over well-written sentences (a fellow former English Major or language-loving dork, like me), this is a great book for you."
4,heavy shoe but solid build,"the shoes looked as good and cool as they did on the site and they fit perfectly..i can agree with the other reviewer that they were heavy and have a stiff feel but some people may like the heavier feel of the shoe unless youre gonna be doing some kind of hectic activity that requires allot of erratic movements, but for people who probably go off the beaten track on the rocky roads and gravel trails these shoes are the perfect fit, actually the feel of these shoes do remind me of the stiff durable construction type feel of timberlands rugged series of boot and shoe"
4,Tsubo,"Tsubo - means - pressure point in Japanese - shoe stands for its name. Shoe is comfortable and I wouldn't say heavy (DMs are heavy), but it's not your lite sneaker. Tsubos are very well made. Recommend!"
2,Look fine but feel bad,"I bought this shoes mainly for hiking as they seem rugged. Although I was reluctant to the brand (never heard about it), the price made me try them out. After opening the box my impression was positive, they look very nice, and seem to be very well done. But after grabbing one of them I figured out they were heavy, as a result of a very thick out-sole. It turned out not only being thick, but pretty stiff, making me feel quite uncomfortable while walking. Also the tip of the shoe is a continuation of the sole, and is annoying to feel your fingers touching such a hard surface when doing some extreme movement, like stopping suddenly. Overall, they look good, but feel bad, so I'm returning this and hoping that in the future they use better out-soles, in which case I'll give them another opportunity."
1,This edition is not worth purchasing,"Our library owns the original edition of this book, but I wanted a copy to have available for patrons to check out and read at home. I bought this edition because it was inexpensive and I believed it would be a suitable copy. I was wrong. The printing is horrible and it's very difficult to read. The photographs are not legible at all. The text is readable, but blurry. This edition is advertised as 'digitally remastered,' but it's actually digitally ruined. Do not buy this edition, search for a used copy of a previous edition."
5,College book purchase 2,I purchased this book for my daughter and was pleased to get it so quickly. It was also in good condition as described. Hope all of my purchase go so smoothly! Great Seller. Thank you
4,Product Review,The item was in the expected condition: like new. Very satisfying for me. There truly is not much else to say about the product.
3,Surprized,I ordered this book from the used section and it was in such good condition. I was really happy with it.
5,Great Music History/Appreciation Book!,"We used this book in my IB Music class in high school, and I highly recommend it. The CDs are helpful, but you will find that even without them, it is a great asset. Most of the recordings are very standard, so you could easily find them online if you didn't want to buy the CDs and wanted to hear the ""listening examples."" It is very clear and includes good timelines which makes it easy to study.I am a music major in college and own this book just because it is so user friendly."
2,DVD was ripped out,"Everything arrived on time packaged in a bubble-wrap sort of envelope, which is fine by me, but the DVD included with the book was missing. In the back, the holder for it was obviously torn out. Great price, but I need that DVD for my class. It isn't just an ""extra"" sort of thing. Will be returning once another copy arrives."
2,"Projects seem nice, but text needs more work","I've already built two of the projects from this book. However, I had problems with both. The authors seem to have stock in the woodfiller companies as they are consistently advising you to put screw holes through visible faces. There were parts missing in the list of materials from one project and the diagrams didn't match the finished product. Some of the ideas seem a little tacky, like the Grandmother Clock. Overall though, there are some good ideas, and it's a great way to get started. I can just see a beginner getting frustrated as pieces don't fit or don't work due to the mismatched diagrams and lack of instructions. I think a little more proofing on the part of the publishing company could have really cleared this up."
3,Fragmented depictions of great cruelty,"I know the very great reputation this book has. It was chosen as the best novel of the past twenty- five years in a survey done by the NY Times. So my own impressions about the book are obviously not those of a great number of readers.Nonetheless for me the book was a disappointment. The idea of presenting the story through a series of non- chronlogical fragments somehow made the successive cruelties presented in the work appear as part of a violent demonstration. I could not sympathize with the characters as I had no coherent sense of who they were. They seemed unreal constructions whose principal purpose was the demonstrating of certain historical and political points, which however valid ( anti- slavery) were not here made into a humane document."
3,Ghost story detracts from an otherwise important book,"Slavery and its devastating aftermath are such important subjects, and for some reason, there are virtually no great novels on this topic. In my opinion, this book received the Nobel Prize more for its subject matter than for the actual quality of the book.The characters of Sethe and the ex-slave, Paul D., are wonderfully written, and when the book stayed with the story of how they endured, and escaped from, slavery, it was gripping.However, every time the story shifted to the ghost of Sethe's dead daughter haunting her, and the mother-sister-daughter squabbling, it lost me.The book left me hungry to read a long, well-written, historical novel about slavery and its aftermath, sort of the African-American equivalent of a Herman Wouk or James Michener novel. Until that is written, I recommend Beloved because of its historical importance, but I found the book disappointing after reading so many rave reviews."
3,beloved,"Toni Morrison's ""Beloved"" was first published in 1987. This novel was set after the Civil War in Cincinnati, Ohio. This is the story about Sethe, an escaped slave, and her family. She survives so much, but when her ""dead"" child appears into her life, and then disappears just as quickly, she just cannot manage that. Paul D., a friend and former slave, might be her only salvation. This unique novel combines imagination and truths of history and still remains a popular novel through the millenium, speaking to the past of some terrible and so great circumstances. ""Beloved"" won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. - Doreen Baumgartner"
4,Wonderfully written - reader must let story line come to them,"Beloved is obviously a very good novel. One of the more stylistically written books in a long time. Morrison's prose, while different, is what gives the book its very vibrant life and soul. The story line, while quite good, evolves slowly so the reader should be sure to relax and allow the book to unfold. The writing is at such a high level of beauty that the waiting is hardly noticable. Beloved will be enjoyed by all who can allow a different style of writing into their lives. It is a style that seems to come from deep within the author - in essence it defines ""visceral"". Simply a great contemporary writer and book."
1,"Belived, an overated novel.","As a graduate student of the School of Education in University of Connecticut, I had pleasure to read and invastigate many great novels and poems. Morrisons ""Beloved"" or other works, are not great novels. When one reads the book, one maight get the impression that s/he is reading through somebodys notes. I had the plesure to read the book before the movie was made. In my opinion Morrison just writes spontaneus books which are overated. Before ""Beloved"" came out on the screen nobody was excited about it. The book is hard to read, it makes no sanse, many things are never explained and are just used once without any reason. After reading ""Sula"" I got the same impression; Morrison was too much into her imagination to write a book. Perhaps she should step away and let real writers take over. Her books are neither interesting nor developed."
2,A Bunch of Nonsense,I thought this book was the weirdest think I had ever set my eyes on. I was confused in the beginning and then I became bored with the whole story.
1,"This book is overdone, repetitive and BORING.","Don't waste your time reading this one! It is a struggle to finish because the events (and vocabulary) are repeated over and over. Also, the descriptive narrative is overdone and BORING."
3,What the Hell!?,"Thats all I have to say about this book. The beginning is really slow and you have no clue as to what the hell Toni is talking about. As the book goes on though, you begin to peice together the story and you think you understand everything...but beleive me, you don't. Ok, lets get this strait, Sethe killed her baby so her baby wouldn't go through being a slave. The ghost in the house is the baby, which is Beloved...is she back from the dead or what? Geez, maybe im stupid or something, but if you want a book that confuses you read this one. Happy reading!"
2,This book wasn't as great as I expected.,"Beloved was unbelievable and drawn out. The only reason I can figure out it could have got a Nobel prize is because it was written by a black author and had black characters in it. I read a lot of Oprah Winfrey's book club materials and I was disapointed that she selected this one. I had a lot of empathy for the characters tragedies. After I finished the book the characters ordeals stayed in my mind, but overall I was left with a bad feeling. I refuse to even see the movie. This book did not deserve the recognization it received. It was an ok story, but nothing great. Toni Morrison appears to be very prejudiced and biased and it certainly comes out in her writing."
4,Definitely worth the effort,"""Beloved"" is not an easy read. Morrison's use of language was at first difficult to get used to, but I soon found myself slipping into the characters and really losing myself in the poetic flow of the story. Re-reading certain sections was not only necessary, but a joy to discover some little nuance that escaped me the first time.The subject of slavery, although not an original theme, is presented from such a personal perspective, and in such an intriguing plot line, that it hits home full force. Several times I found myself crying, yet unable to put down the book. It is incredibly moving and heartwrenching.I find the character of Sethe one of the most memorable and intriguing women I have encountered in fiction. Her wisdom, naivite, strengths and weaknesses all combine to form a contradiction in a believable and sympathetic heroine.I haven't seen the movie, but I'm sure it can't measure up to this excellent piece of original story-telling."
2,I sure hope the movie's better than the book.,"What a sorry book to read right after I read Cold Mountain. I'm sorry, but this book does not agree with me!!! It does not make SENSE. The whole ghost concept was simply too unrealistic for me to swallow. It did have moments, like when the book talks about the tree on Sethe's back. Good! Great!!! But honestly, the book was very hard to follow at times. The ending, to me, was more than a little dissapointing. I suppose the overall explanation for the rating is I JUST DIDN'T like it!!! Like I said, Beloved can't even compare with Cold Mountain, which happens to be the best piece of literature on the planet. And if what they say is true, that films never measure up to the novel, oh, gosh... You couldn't PAY me to see that movie."
1,Over Rated,"It is may be considered vain for a high school student to disagree with the Noble Prize for literature, but in this case I'll risk it. Belved by Toni Morrison was hard to follow and even harder to like. Toni Morrison accomplishes her objective of showing the reader the horrors of slavery but the rest of the story is often silly. The book takes place in Post Civil War rural Cincinnati. It deals with such themes as isotion, guilt, remorse, and the supernatural. Another defect to this book is that the superatural seems out of place in this book. The book starts ordinarily and then a ghost appers. In Beloved, Toni Morrison overdoes her story making her book slow and unenjoyable. But diffrent strokes, some may love this novel but Ill stick by my negative criticism."
1,I fail to see what everyone finds so great about this book.,"I am a fan of Orson Scott Card, who believes that if a writer has something to present, he should present it and quit hinting and beating around the bush. And I agree. But the entire time I read <i>Beloved,</i> I felt as if there were a plethora of ideas that Toni Morrison wanted to get across, but she just WOULDN'T DO IT. And it drove me crazy. The story itself is actually very short, but it is told upwards of six times in flashback, each time with minutely more detail, which I guess would be fine had I been able to CARE about the story anymore by the time I got to the point where it was all explained. Basically this is a boring meaningless story about a woman who kills her daughter, but really ISN'T about a woman who kills her daughter say many critics; I think they're making it up. If it were possible to give this book ZERO stars I would do so."
2,This book is popular because it's about slavery,"I didn't think this book made much sense. It was hard to follow, kind of boring, and lacked depth. I feel bad saying that since it's on such a serious subject, but I believe it is critically acclaimed just because it is about slavery, not because it is well-written. Anything Oprah touches turns to gold, and she really tookd this one under her magic wings."
3,Not my favorite but a worthy read,"This was not my favorite book but it still drew me in and took me for a ""ride"". It is depressing and bizarre but it has some magical aspect to it that is unexplainable. It is a worthy read, but don't expect to completely understand it."
1,Confusing Foolish Fiction,This book is really disturbing and filled with emotional persuassion which has no basis in fact. It is very hard to understand and is not worth the read. If a child wrote a book like this - they would probably get hauled off to iron bars for being psychotic. The book is not interesting. If you really want to find out about it - watch the movie. This book is a political sham of fictitious events & emotions.
2,Too many technics,"I believe that Toni Morrison made this book to see how people are stupid.There is no verisimilitude. Some sentences are void of meaning.I am not impressed at all and I regret if she is the best author the U.S. can produce (Nobel Prize.)This is not even fantastic.She has the quality of a journalist, and knowledge, and technics from her experiences, but she has no talent as a writer.Overuse of punctuation -- a writer doesn't use punctuation for a meaning like the ';' for the rupture between Sethe and her kids. This is overuse of technics and some sentences mean nothing at all.I think it is a mock-novel ! (to see how people can like something evily done)"
2,frustrating,"Beloved is an extremely frustrating book. Too many flashbacks, too much illogic, and too little cohesion. Beloved never decides what it wants to be: Is it a ghost story? Is it a study of the afteraffects of slavery? Is it a coming of age tale? It's a book that you feel you ought to read instead of being one that you really want to read."
4,Affecting and Effective,"No matter how many history books one picks up on slavery and its effects, it's impossible to replicate the response Beloved elicits. Tony Morrison does a brilliant job of pulling us inside the world of a handful of former slaves' lives just outside Cincinnati, post-Emancipation.Her style is unorthodox, sometimes reading like free association by post-traumatic stress syndrome sufferers, and in many ways it can be reminiscent of Catch 22 (Side note - Beloved is not funny, the similarity is more the ways in which a character is formed by a single trauma.) However, it is not overly difficult to follow if one reads carefully.While some may argue that Beloved has been inflated by critics due to the seriousness of its slavery, this book deserves to be ranked where it is. It will leave you feeling like you've experienced something, not just read about it."
3,Brilliant but confusing,"I thought Beloved was evocatively beautiful yet incredibly sad. Many parts confused me. What happened to Beloved in the FIRST PLACE? The author never said! WHY did it happen? What was about to happen that Beloved needed rescuing from? What was with the stream of consciousness poetry near the end? I didn't understand a word of it. All the jumping back and forth from past to present ad nauseum was just too much. On the other hand, the characters were wonderfully defined and seemed like real people with all their human frailties and strengths. I wanted to take many of them home to my house to give them a better life!I'm not sure I would recommend this book. There were too many loose ends. I like things all wrapped up in neat packages!"
4,"""This Book Unites The Mind And The Soul""","She settled into a lifetime of residence on the Avenue of Contradiction. Telling herself -knawing into her thoughts what had already been ingrained in her heart- ""Only a little! Never allow yourself to take in as much love as your heart can hold."" And yet, it was that same heart that loved her children so much that she would take her own hand against them rather than see schoolteacher profit from their flesh. Even with the jagged handsaw as her accomplice, Sethe could not sever the intent for unity that flourished within the umbilical cord, and so, she and Beloved remained on one accord in the Here and After. Sethe threw ice-cold stones from her Yesterdays at my back while I ran through the pages of her Tomorrows in Post-War Ohio. She worried my soul the whole time I was there. I'm glad I'm home now."
3,Scattered and Cold,"While the prose is masterful, Beloved failed to inspire any sort of sympathy. The period has been so extensively covered that it is difficult to form any kind of emotive reality--even when laid down in such poetic language. Themes are scattered--almost beyond hope of faithful reconstruction. I admired Morrison's style, yet the fragmented and familiar feel precluded any enjoyment."
2,Beloved: Yeah right,"Ok, you all must be thinking I'm this all-over negative type of person. Well, this book, was VERY low on my reading list. After reading the first 40 pages, I was so lost, it wasn't even funny. Too many characters were introduced in the first few pages. I think the author could have written the story in a little bit of a lower ""key"" so-to-speak. And, as most people do, I judged not only the rest of the book, but the author herself, on the basis of her first 40 pages. First impressions last, as the saying goes. So, as my teachers would know, I express a deep dislike for the authors style of writing. But, don't let my negativity--if you may call it that--stop you from reading this book. For you, it might all tie together in a tight knot, but for me, there were too many strands to tie off, and most ended off astray."
4,toni morrison's bestyet!,toni morrison tears up the pages with shear lyrical beauty and her characters are very human! It took my just 24 hrs to finish the book and can't wait for the movie!
5,Moving and extremely powerful,The story is very controversial and difficult to think about. But the way Morrison writes is so moving and powerful that I think the book is a must read. It is important that our society read books that give such insight to historical times. To be able to read this book is difficult and challenging but also so incredibly inspiring. Morrison writes in such a way that you believe you would act in exactly the way the main character does. Unbelivably powerful!
1,Hated it! Do I have to give it a star?,I did not like this book at all. It is hard to follow and keep up with. If it were not a required read for a college class I would have never read it. I even considered dropping the class because I didn't want to complete this assignment. There are so many other things to write about. why pain and anger? Why so much disgust. We have read about the disgusting things slaves suffered at the hands of their 'masters' it was horrible but why do we need another book?
3,lsc final,"What were some of my reactions to this book? Well at first I really didn't like it, because it confused me alittle. but once I got into it I kind of started to enjoy it. Really like how they had the ghost in the book. I thought that it was cool because it was Denver's baby. The book kept me interested in the middle. At the begging I thought about getting a new book, because it was a such a slow start. I guess that overall though that I would recommend this book to someone. But they would have to stick with it. Thanks for your time!"
1,This book is trash,"I read this in college. Awful and literally disgusting to read. The impact of slavery still resonates with us today, by bringing a ghost into the story it makes it fantasy and I found it impossible to take this book seriously. Toni Morrison is the most overrated author in America, it's only because of Oprah (the most overrated ""personality"" in America"") that she is popular."
2,Very hard to follow,"This story jumps from current time to past time and narrating person to narrating person so it is confusing. I love books about slavery, civil war but this was very disappointing."
2,Beloved: You People are Sheep,"Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Beloved was one of the dullest, most unimaginative books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. OK, life in the South is rough. The black experience is a deeply spiritual thing. Richard Wright said that 40 years ago, as did Zora Neale Hurston. And they said it a lot better than Tony Morrison. Morrison is an overrated author whose success is as much due to Oprah's poor opinions as her own talent."
5,Beloved - a masterpiece,"Beloved, by Toni Morrison, is a shattering book. The ingredients of the story are simple: slavery, a dead baby, broken lives and a broken family. But the lyrical prose and ingenious structure of this tale yields far more than a good novel: it produces a masterful epic that resounds with themes personal and universal, from the haunting of the past to the terror of slavery.Some readers may not digest the way the story is told, and the author certainly makes no allowances. Her writing is similar to her protagonist, Sethe's, situation: either accept, understand, and experience the tale to its fullest, or leave bewildered.Beloved is an extraordinary novel that I strongly recommend anyone to read."
3,Beautiful and confusing,"Although it took me 2 months to read the book, when I did actually force myself to read it, I enjoyed it. Toni Morrison's story is beautiful and complex. In fact, this book is so complex that I do NOT recommend it for the type of person who refuses to think about/re-read certain passages.Also, I noticed that in other reviews, some people were distracted/offended by the sexual imagery in the story. While sex is mentioned a few times, only the ignorant would be so obsessed with these few passages to find the entire book repulsive.If you want a challenging book that opens your eyes to the hardships slaves faced, then this is the book for you."
3,Beloved,"Amazon.com great company to buy from. Prices, shipping, etc.I was expecting a bit more in the book beings the movie was so good, did not hold my interest, but the price was good."
5,"""This is not a story to pass on""","This novel makes you think and use your brain from the first sentence to the last, if you don't like to think while reading, then this book is not for you. It is, however, a truly breathtaking book that makes you ask questions about what you thought you believed. Through Sethe, readers are brought into a life of unspeakable despair and brave hope that are mixed together in a way that leaves you wanting more. With no true ending, this post-modern book leaves you expecting to see more chapters; but that's a signature of a good book, it makes you think about it and remember it, long after you've finished reading."
1,Do not buy Audio version if hard of hearing,"I tried to listen to the CD version of this book. Morrison reads it herself. She should have hired a professional. I listen to books in my car. There is road noise. Even with my hearing aids and the volume turned to max I could not understand much of what she was saying -- even when the car was stopped. She talks in this breathless, whispering, trailing off at the end of words sort of way. Those of you with hearing issues know what I am talking about. Get the written version if you want to read this book."
3,Too obtuse for her own good,"When I am in the mood to get lost in a whirlpool of complicated and obscure dialogue, I will stick to Henry James. At least James' form follows the function of his novels. Morrison's style does not add to the artistry of what could have been a very powerful novel based on the theme. All the plaudits are much ado about nothing."
2,Overrated,"Toni Morrison has a strong grasp of the English language in everything she has written that I've read. But in them all, the words never really flowed for me and came up cold and stilted. I didn't care about the characters, I only cared about how far it was until the last page so that I could be done with it.This book is vastly overrated, especially by my english profressor who thought it was the greatest American novel ever. Sad, but true."
4,I hope the book has more info than the movie.,"Actually , I have not read the book yet but I haved endured the movie. The movie was very complicated yet it was entertaining. The only problem that I had was that it was hard to understand the entire film once it was pieced together. I think some of the major ""pieces"" were left out for whatever reasons. Hopefully the book will go more indepth."
2,Dead Cold,"Beautiful language, but the story and characters left me cold. I ended up reading it purely to see how Morrison's words would unfold. I think I would have been moved if it had been a book of poems."
5,Morrison is the best!!!,Toni Morriso is an absolute goddess of literature! Everything she writes is magnificent. She is the last living great American author. Anyone with a hart and a soul will love her.
4,It is very in depth in showing what slaves had to deal with,Even though this was required reading in my high school I found it to be very tough but because my teacher was able to show us what Morrison wanted us to see and how slavery affected everybody's life. Morrison packed every page with so much information that you need to be patient and take notes while you read. I would suggest getting a group together to pose your questions and have discussions like I had in my class which helped a lot because you miss more than you see.
5,Wonderfully Powerful,"This book is very powerful. Once you read it, you will want to read it over and over to understand everything that happened, but you won't be able to. Morrison effectively mimics humans' process of remembering what was once forgotten. In addition, she shows the hardships that African Americans had to deal with and how the traumas of their lives affected them."
3,Surprising it was better than I thought,"Well, after much hestitation and putting it off I finally sat down to read this book. I was surprised to find it a good story. Its a story about freedom, remaining free at all cost. Its about community and watching out for one another. Then, there is Beloved who is looking for love from the person who took life away from her. I guess hearing so much about the book, I was able to understand the symbolisms that I think I would have normally missed. The reading is slow, its difficult, but if you take your time it comes together. Even if you don't understand something, I found it will be revealed later in the book, just hold on."
5,a book you will never forget,"Why I read this book, I am not sure. It took a great sense of wonder to read and finish to the end. To wonder about the person who could endure writing such a book increased its enormous value,You knew she told a terrible truth.Maybe the most important book ever writen about how life was for blacks in america.It fuels the desire to never forget BELOVED and to do what you can to reduce or irradicate abuse of any kind to other human beings."
3,Intruiging,"This was my first attempt at a Toni Morrison work and I must say, I wasn't really disappointed. Ms. Morrison rights in such a style that you actually hear the hooves of the approaching horses, see the frantic scrambling of the desperate slave, and picture the blood-soaked bodies of her children.Probably the one thing that I regret about this book is the fact that I listened to it on tape, as opposed to actually reading it in print. This caused a little confusion as I reached 3/4 of the way through the book and I tried to relate to characters and scenes that had been briefly described in earlier chapters who were now front and center.Overall, I really enjoyed the book and I'll certainly seek out Ms. Morrison's other works for enjoyment."
3,A well-written puzzle,"I just finished Beloved and have a very vague idea about what it was all about. I must say I think Toni Morrison is an excellent writer. The detail, and description in her writing is amazing-but she failed to create a clear storyline. A lot of it was almost gibberish to me-especially when Beloved is speaking. With such wonderful, dimensional characters-the novel could have been a masterpiece. Though I love challenging works and like to interpret literature, I found this to be a frustrating puzzle and almost impossible to decipher!"
1,Morrison's Beloved,"I am currently an undergraduate at Princeton University where Toni Morrison is a teacher. She is not a very kind person. In any event, this book is overwritten and generally insults my intelligence. I recommend reading Faulkner instead of this plagiarizing trash. Huzzah!"
1,Simply Unreadable,This book is the Emperor's New Clothes of literature. Critics fall all over themselves to praise it for fear of not seeming sufficiently erudite. I think Morrison is secretly laughing at all of them.
1,"good books get the shaft, and THIS gets the prize? COME ON!","how did this book (if you can call it that) get an award? the only award this crap deserves is ""bob's award for horridly long and annoying literature."" this is the biggest pile of hot, steaming trash literature that i've ever read. it's a soap opera set in post-slavery times. it starts normal enough... but then the baby that sethe killed comes back to life as a 1.5-year-old stuck in a 20 year old body. then to give the story another bullcrap turn, she starts screwing sethe's lover, paul d. and somehow she thinks that that's gonna get her closer to sethe. you tell me where this logic plays in. what a lousy story. fans of soap operas will love it; i, for one, thought it was a crappy book with a crappy plot with a few bad acid trips mixed in."
5,Stands the test of time ...,I had read this novel years ago and revisted it just this weekend. Once again I found it a dazzling piece that pulled me through in one sitting. Morrison creates a bewitching world of dimensional characters. Simply beautiful!
1,Morrison's writing style is less to be desired,"This was the first and only book I have attempted to read by Toni Morrison and I really could not get used to her style of writing. Since I could not get past the style, I could not enjoy the book and get past the first couple of chapters. This book may have an ""amazing"" story line (if you can get that far); however the choppy dialect was hard to follow and read. Morrison tried to hard to immulate the dialect of that period, but it was more of a hinderance. I did not find this book reaching out and grabbing my attention. Good try though..."
2,The banter of the washerwomen,"That is the only way I can describe Morrison's style. It is like being down at the creek, listening to the gossip of the washerwomen. There is no linear progression. Rambling and feral. It was frankly just hard to wrap my brain around this plot and, more importantly, the method of its unveiling. Now, before you throw me into the Morrison-hater category, I also read Paradise, and, though some of the same difficulties were present, (many pages were read four or five times trying to figure out what the hell was going on), I enjoyed it and found its theme more liberating. Beloved was simply a downer, wallowing in a depressing past. Paradise better balanced the search for roots with the need for wings."
3,Hype isn't enough,"Where do I begin?? This story was recommended to me by my girlfriend who happens to also be the person selecting the books for our book club. Anyhow, last month we read Beloved, and i can honestly say that we were not impressed. The word choice and composition of points seemed to take away from the character development. The only reason why i love fiction-because of the character development. Other than that it was an okay read. I certainly hope her other books are not too excessively wordy.-TT"
1,Absolutly Terrible,"I read this book at the suggestion of a brilliant teacher, but was lost from the first page. I would never reccommend this book to anyone, unless they need something to cure their insomnia. This book was the wort book I've ever read."
1,hahahahahahah...poseurs,"Think you are smarter than everyone else?Understand the plight of African-Americans more than anyone, because you are open-mined, unlike the conformist masses?Then this book is perfect for you! Now, am I racist? Of course not. Is it that I have a problem with offensive or ""provocative"" material...no, I love Amistead. Unfortunately, with a touchy subject such as race issues in America, it's hard to actually critique a book for its content, instead of its message. But if you want to see a real piece of art dealing with slavery, watch Amistead...much better."
1,A Lackluster Performance,"This book was not a total disapointment, it didnt take long to read.Toni has a comon failing among female writers, unfocused ideas and flat characters. the subject matter wasnt something that particlarly intrested me.I guess it would be possible to like this book, but someone like me, I think Ill stick with sci-fi."
1,Are people really paying $11.99 for digital books?,Are people really paying $11.99 for digital books? I wanted to reread this book because my son is reading it for his senior HS literature class. So we bought one hard copy for $10 and now the digital is $11.99? I just can't do it ...
1,Warning: This book may cause severe boredom.,"BELOVED is poor in its totality. I was forced to read it for an English class. It begins with a poorly developed premise and ends with lose ends still untied. The Immortal Beloved is completely implausible in its historical setting. Morrison made no attempt to create an appropriate premise/setting. BELOVED must have won the Pullizter for political reasons. This book has no depth or content. After finishing it, virtually everyone in my class felt cheated."
2,Overrated,I was expecting pure magic to flow from every page given all that I'd heard about this book but was really disappointed. It was too metaphorical and without any real punch to it. Also way too heavy and depressing for an end of day read.
3,A conundrum...,I read this book as part of a challenge to read all the books on the NYT list of best books of the last 25 years. At the end of it I felt that all the other winners had been robbed of the #1 spot that went to Beloved - & that the #1 spot went to Beloved out of political correctness.Beloved is a fine book but is relatively poorly constructed & confusing - the reader's inability to sort it all out is attributed by the prize awarding committees to the reader's shortcomings rather than the author's inability to make her plot & characters clear. But anyone who has read the book - particularly against the other nominees!!! - & really searched for meaning understands that at a basic level Beloved can not live up to its reviews.It is a sorry day when books like Philip Roth's American Pastoral etc are superceded by Beloved.
1,"Disturbing, , confusing, and harrowing","I am sorry I read this book. I found that it was not well-written, unengaging, and very confusing. I gave it a chance, and read the story to the end but was not impressed whatsoever. I don't understand the hype surrounding this novel and I cannot believe it received a Pulitzer Prize. I just can't get into the ""Magical Realism"" - it was too weird to me. ..."
1,Greatest American Book In 25 Years - Give Me A Break . . .,"The hype and hyperbole over Morrison is a perfect example of literary snobbism. This book is incomprehensible, therefore, that small group that either understands it [or pretends to] struts and preens and deem themselves to be the arbiters of taste for American literature. ""Beloved"" is overdone, overused, overwritten, overhyped and is turning a generation of college students into book haters by stuffing this down their throats in English class. If you need me, I'll be reading books with a plotline and a point."
3,"Intereseting, but highly over-rated and hard to understand.","PA-tennage reader. I found this book to be a somewhat dissaspointment. I really enjoy Toni Morrison's work, but this one was quite scattered and hard to understand. I am a really good reader, and i figured it was hard for me to understand because of my age, but a lot of adults that I know also had the same problem. I was confused on the signigicance os the ""Here Dog"", was Beloved reincarnated into it? Overall it was okay, but could've been better."
3,Very difficult book to read -- doesn't capture interest well,The jumbled thought presentation/flow made this one of the most difficult books I have ever read. The subject matter was not disturbing -- just the writer's style. I did finish the book and I can only hope that the movie will be better!
3,Good but provokes plenty of reader analysis.,"I found that ""Beloved"" was so filled with important symbolism that in reading the book and watching the movie, I would find it almost impossible for people who have not been culturally tied to the story to understand how very powerful it is."
3,This book requires a high level of understanding,"This book was rather confusing to me. The style of writing Toni Morrison used, to me is unique, and requires the reader to have a higher level of understanding to completely comprehend the book, and still get the most out of it. The book skips around a lot, refering back to earlier happenings in the story that makes it diffucult to keep up. Along with the literature she used for the characters, made u stop and think about what she is trying to say. This book also took a lot of relating, you would have to put yourself in the time period and position the characters were in to really understand their rationalization and decision making. Overall this book wasn't my personal favorite, but I didn't dislike it either. I would recommend this book to anyone with understanding and compassion."

5,Absolutely Stunning,"After having been forced to read this book for an English Lit class, I thought it was going to be boring like many of my other setworks. Not So! From the first page this book grabs your attention and doesn't let go for a second. It is absolutely amazing and was even more so on the second reading."
3,"Good, but difficult and overrated","This was a good book, I do recomend it. But I found it extreamily difficult, even for Morrison's tough style. And on the whole overrated. It wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be.But like I said, it is a good book. The story of trying to deal with your past, your communities past, your personal past, is always an important issue to explore.The book is full of historial notes and is a history lesson in and of itself. You could spend a whole year just learning about what items and stories Morrison used to craft her version of a true story."
1,confusing,"This book was very hard for me to follow. Most of the time I had no idea what was going on or if the narrator was describing the present or a flashback. There were also quite a few scenes/lines that had little to no sense at all. Like the part where Sethe has to pee, but can't make it to the outhouse. The act of her peeing is very graphically described, but it had no purpose. It was never brought up again by anyone in the story. I literally put the book down, and with a confused look, asked ""why?"""
3,Good but?,"Beloved was a good read for the first three quarters of the book. However, there were sections in the end that were confusing and difficult to understand in terms of the whole story. I think it was as much me as it was the author for so often just the time of day can affect my level of understanding. Toni Morrison’s tail is so riveting at times that you cannot but the book down and yet, at other times you wonder what she is trying to convey. I think this would be a great read for a book group. Within a group you can test your own reflection against the group but as an individual reader you may have problems following the story line at times, as I did."
5,Great literature!,"Looking over some of the reviews, I came across one stating they want writers to go back to writing simple stories. When is this simple story era we're talking about? Cause literature was sure never simple (easiest example to cite-Shakespeare). If you want a good, fun, easy read, this novel is not for you. But if you want literature, then give this book a try. Morrison's style is engaging and really allows us to get into the feel of the characters and their stories. Keeping this short though- I am reading this book as a college student. Any younger, and I don't think I would have appreciated it as much (parf of the reason I believe this book should not be taught in high school).In short, great book. Awesome job Toni Morrison."
1,Like pulling teeth,"""Beloved"" is a book that has garnered many accolades from both the press and my book-loving friends. Save your time! This story is so disjointed and obtuse that making sense of it will give you a headache. Paul D. is the only believable character in the story, but he seems a mere afterthought until the metaphors are finally played out. This is a Pulitzer prize winner"
1,Literature?,"Somehow Morrison has gotten a reputation for her ""literature."" This is a shame as her abilities are quite limited indeed. This novel is by far her worst and that must have taken some effort. A incomprehensible muddle of stereotypes and cliches written in a style far beyond this author's limited scope."
2,Over-rated,Is it just me or is this book completely over-rated? America is short on black female authors so we should over praise the ones we do have.
3,The African-American tragedy can never be overstated.,"Heart -rending throughout and charged with emotion . Author is similar to Thomas Hardy in that she shows profound understanding of the pysche of characters of the opposite sex. A little humour (even if it be ""dark"" humuor) and an element of hope through learning from tragedy could take this already good novel to an even higher realm."
4,Incredible!!,"Until this novel, I had never read any of Ms. Morrison's works. I regretted it. I agree with some of the other reviewers, ""kids will hate books when they are made to read them"". I think anyone with compassion will love ""Beloved"". It made me sorrowful for Sethe. She was a woman trying to protect her children from a horror which no one should experience. I asked myself""would I have made the same decision?"" You may ask yourself too. I think everyone should give this book a try. I can identify with Sethe, trying to live life by her rules and walking proudly by making a choice that others would be reluctant to do. So, please take the time to read this book, it will deepen your awareness and give thanks that slavery no longer exsists."
4,A poem of a novel.,"Ms. Morrison's ""Beloved"" is very similar to poetry. Poetry, as a medium, can be very selective in its audience. Some people ""get"" poetry, while others despise it. So, too, is ""Beloved"". Ms. Morrison's novel is dense with beautiful language and meaning. There are passages that are very de-constructive. The reader is left with just bare words, sounds, even. Each reader will take away from this book a personal message, but that message is based upon the experiences they bring to the book. At the very least, give it a read. You may find yourself surprised."
5,Beautiful and Sleep Disturbing,I have already reviewed this book. But I have re-read it so I think I should re-review it! I still think it is the best book I have ever read.It captures beauty and horror perfectly and is terrifyingly deep - it affects the reader pyschologically without them even realising it.
3,Emotion and horror graphically welded together; breathtaking,"I found this book easy to read despite what I had heard about Toni Morrison's past achievements. Emotion is eloquently conveyed and Ms. Morrison weaves in horror using her fluent talent, giving an unmissable read. I have to put a damper on my review and admit that I found the ending to be dissapointing and left me feeling rather cheated. It just didn't seem to match the grand quality the first two thirds seem to express to me. Read it; open your mind, but put it down near the end. It'll keep your opinion high."
3,Beloved: Toni Morrison's Most Complicated Book,"""Beloved"" was an intense book. Toni Morrison has once again succeeded with an extremely complicated story, one that most authors couldn't pull off with such ease. The book's main protagonist is an escaped slave by the name of Sethe. Sethe lives with her daughter Denver in Ohio, several years after the end of the civil war. One day Sethe and Denver receive a visitor by the name of Beloved, who doesn't know where she came from or even her last name. The story revolves around the complex relationship that forms between the three women and the terrible secrets that develop. ""Beloved"" is definfitely not an easy read, as I even had trouble understanding the basic story. Morrison often goes back and forth in the stream of consciousness and switches the narrator from a third person omniscent character, to Sethe, to Denver, to Beloved. Going back once or twice is a technique a reader will need to develop before venturing into this classic book."
4,so many levels,"this book is multi-layered, complicated, horrifying and fascinating. you will probably have to read it twice. morrison is notoriously hard to read. ""beloved"" is no exception, but it's the best of the morrison books that i've read (""the bluest eye"" is also good).beloved is full of lyrical prose and symbolism. the story structure isn't linear (it's not beginning, middle, end). instead it's like an onion. it starts on the outside, and sort of goes in circles, revealing layers until you've reached the heart of the story.it's a very challenging read both because of its structure, and its symbolism. perfect if you're a brainy, artsy type. bad if you're looking for a mindless beach read."
2,ENG 105 #18,"I must say this book might be a powerful novel to others of the same view as Toni Morison. Although I find it intersting as how the book was written (the style) I find it very hard to keep up with Toni Morison in her description of slavry and love. Some details in the book made it intersting, ones that have little meanings but to show the way things are. The book did however, made me think about the life a slave lived back then, which i must admit, i never thought about it. Overall, if you are an excellent reader in ""highlevel"" novels, I'm sure you will find the book intersting SIMPLY becuase there are so many hidden meanings that I've failed to discover."
1,Gee Whiz! Can't Anyone Tell A Good Story These Days?,"It's a good thing I watched the movie before reading the book or else I wouldn't have known what the heck was going. I was stranded at a bus station in Philly and ""Beloved"" was the only book I had to read to pass away the time. Dull, dull, dull. Torture, torture, toture. I had to re-read each page more than once just to understand what was happening. This book is too long, too boring, and extremely overhyped. It leaves you braindead. I enjoyed ""The Bluest Eye"" more than this. Skip this book at all costs and watch the movie instead. The movie's just as boring and confusing, but it's visual and last only 2 hours and 52 mintues, which is less time than a week of reading."
3,"an excellent textbook, a mediocre novel","This book gave a detailed, clinically precise look on slavery and its impact, both physical and emotional, on people. It had many moments of insight, like one only ""loves small"", because what one loves could be taken away easily. The main protangonists actually had an OK life under the old master. But freedom that depends on the mercy of other people is not true freedom. Sethe took to the extremes to protect her children because slavery is worse than death. She let Beloved sucked her life away, partly because she saw nothing of value in herself. Her children were her ""best things"", while she had been ""dirtied"". Another scar from her pervious experience. I can go on and on...But the characters never really reach across to me, as they seemed merely tools to serve a purpose. No, I'm not black. But I've always thought a true classic should touch all humankind. I end up giving it 3 stars nevertheless 'cause it did serve the educational purpose pretty well."
1,I did not yet read this book but plan to i the near future,"I would like Oprah to read a booke, however, that I have read. It is ""peace with God"" by Billy Graham. If you keep in contact with her, maybe you could suggest this to her and her many book club readers. I have all my friends reading this as I had a life changing experience after reading this book! God wants everyone to make their peace with Him. Oprah would be a great person to acknowledge this, as well as Mr. Graham is. Thank you, God Bless you at Amazon and Oprahs Book Club. Sincerely, Lin C.E.O- Keepsake Cottage -"
1,"Dull and obvious, contrived and dull","I read this twice--once because I had to read it and once because I had to teach it. Both times I was stupefied by its thick, plodding, contrived plot and bizarrely drawn characters. I do not understand why on earth this book has received the altitudinous praise it has received. I would not choose to teach it again and I would not recommend it. Maybe something else by Morrison (who I feel is an ""okay"" writer, but certainly not an American great) would do.Apparently, some people gush and gaa-gaa over this tome. Had I been the editor in charge or yea-ing or nay-ing it, there would not have been any reviews on it today.e"
4,Beloved shows a whole different world of slavery.,"We just finished reading Beloved, by Toni Morrison in my junior English class. I really enjoyed it, but many of my classmates couldn't stand it, and found it very offensive. I didn't find it one bit offensive because it gave me a totally new veiw on slavery, a veiw which you can't get from just reading a text-book. Morrison did an excellent job expressing how horrid slavery was. She may have used some vulgar language, but it was the only way to get across the point as strongly as it needs to be said. I really enjoyed this, and I am in the process of writing an essay to text on this book, and it is hard, because the book is hard, but what literature isn't. I am writing the paper on the reference to shadows in the novel, and if anyone has any ideas or comments about shadows please feel free to write me! Thanks! If you haven't read Beloved, read it, you'll love it! :-)"
2,"Not my style, at all","I take nothing away from Toni Morisson's ability to write, she is exceptional. Her style of writing is just not one that I enjoy reading. Beloved's subject matter is important but Morrison's message is so obscured by the sentimentality and ambiguity of her narrative that I feel this is a book written more for Morrison than the reader. I can see why some love it and others hate it. Personally, I found the 'payoff' for the energy spent deciphering this book to be disappointing. Would not recommend it."
2,Slow and confusing,"I listened to the audiobook version with Toni Morrison as the reader. The story was written in a very tedious matter. The content of the story was very disturbing, overall not a book I would recommend."
3,"A Beautiful Novel, but is it worth the Hype?","In a discussion I had recently about this novel, Morrison's 5th, we were considering whether or not it deserved the acclaim that it has received. I personally did not like this novel as much as some of Morrison's other works. Perhaps I have been reading too much Morrison (is that possible?) but I really believe some of her other works deserve more acclaim than Beloved. Morrison is a wonderful writer. She is a true master at her art, but when Beloved was released she was at the top of her popularity. Is it possible that it was her critical acclaim and not necessarily the book that won her the Pulitzer? Thank goodness we have women to write as Morrison does, but I wouldn't say reading Beloved alone can give a person a true appreciation of her complexity. It's a start, but a truly interested reader should not stop there."
3,Good old Cow Poly,"Beloved is a unique novel in that the events do not take place chronologically. The story is told through flashbacks and often confusing dream sequences, especially from the point of the main characters, much like Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club. The story takes place during the age of slavery and the story revolves around Sethe and her troubles. I felt that this book was not an easy read, and through all the flashbacks, memories, and nightmares it was sometimes hard to distinguish what was real and what wasn't."
2,Big Deal,"Beloved gets my nomination for the most overpraised work of literature in recent years. P.C. or not, I question whether the work would have received a fraction of the accolades had it not been written by an otherwise very talented African-American woman, but admit it: Beloved is ponderous and rather dull. One can sympathize intensely with the suffering of the type of people portrayed without agreeing that the book is particularly entertaining. A must-read only for those who feel they ""must."""
5,Agaronce,"This book shows just how vain mankind can become. It demonstraights that if we as a people, are to servive on this world we must work with each other. We nor can anybody think that we are beter than someone else just because we don't understand them, because we have not took the time to learn about their culture. This book shows how anybody in this circumstance would act and even feel, It does not matter what color you are. We would all act the same way. If we the people in this country want to progress and move foward, then we must learn from our past mistakes and change. This book makes it clear that the first step is to understand each other, not to put someone down just because we don't understand them. We must communacate with each other, learn about each other, and togsther strive to build a better future for everyone. That I belive is what Toni Morrisn Is trying to say in this book."
3,"""Beloved""","This book definetly contains alot of atmosphere. You truly feel the pain and fear that the characters are feeling in the novel. However, I never really got into the novel, but that was probably because the mixture of family and slavery did not interest me. The characters are well developed. The voices of the characters are highly impacting. The emotion in the voices and the story is also something most readers will enjoy in this book. The book is not exciting, and it is not an absorbing page turner. The storys leave little to the imagination and don't contain much action. This is a book for somebody who wants to study human emotion and the horrors of slavery."
3,an average person,"i didn' t rea the whole book, but i'm about a half way through. the reason why i'm not finished yet was because this book was kind of boring. but i would recommend that you read it to see whats up. don't buy it, check it out from the local library"
5,A rich tapestry of history and family events,"Wow. That is really all I can say. Wow. To Toni Morrison, if you ever read this page, I would like to express my gratitude to you for writing this book. I love the way it is so textured, so deep, and so real. I am a grade 12 student, and read this novel as an independent study. It wasn't easy, but it was enjoyable. This truly is a must read!"
3,"Great Story, Bad Formatting","My biggest complaint with this book was the formatting that was used for the Kindle Edition. Instead of breaking it down into three parts with individual chapters in between, they chose to split the book up into three chapters. This makes it extremely problematic when reading and discussing with a group who is using the book."
3,Mayhem,"Toni Morrison has an amazing plot develop through the novel following the past lives of slaves from a Kentucky plantation called Sweet Home and the present lives of Sethe and Paul D. (who were at Sweet Home together). The story is told in a chaotic mess of poetry, memories, and present day action that ends presenting only more mystery. Many parts of the novel however, seem too gruesome. Although the descriptions are of slavery and slavery deserves to be seen for what it truly is, Morrison could have left more to the imagination. Overall though, I enjoyed the novel and all it represented."
4,Community,"This book is beautifully written and has a powerful message. The message is about community. Evil does not bother a strong, cohesive community. Toni Morrison is a wonderful author and I recommend any one of her books."
2,Tries too hard?,"Morrison, while clearly a talanted author, weilds imagry like a chainsaw. There is no subtly in this work, and she often is too indirect when she needs to be direct, and too blunt when she shouldn't be. To compare her writing to that of Garcia-Marquez is to the the later a grave injustice."
2,Why the hype?,"After all the hype surrounding this novel, I was excited to read it for a college English class. However, after finishing the novel I am sorry I ever opened it. The story is intriguing but Morrison's writing is atrocious. The book is 275 pages long but any competent author could have written it in less than 175. At times her writing takes the author into a stream of consciousness that leads nowhere but to infinite sentence fragments, haziness as to who is speaking, and a headache. When speaking about African American writers, Hurston is worlds above Morrison."
1,"Ohh, how I wanted to like this book","I'm always trying to read books that are hailed as good, hoping to enjoy them as much as everyone else does. I'm sad to say that this book didn't agree with me. This isn't to say that it isn't a good book- after all, this review is just my opinion.Much of the book confused me because the book went back and forth in time in paragraphs. On one page, the first paragraph would be twenty years in the past, and the next paragraph would be five years in the past, and the third paragraph would be in the present. (by present I mean late 1800's).Sometimes even in one paragraph the story would go through several different events over several different years. This confused me to the point where I had no idea what was going on! So I didn't enjoy it very much. But oh, how I wanted to! It seemed like it would be a book I would enjoy."
1,betrayal,"This book was an exhausting read paragraph after paragragh I neither followed nor figured out the story and only did so by reading reviews. My ancestors were house and field slaves in North Carolina, and I have heard many tragic, and triumphant stories told in plain, lyrical, straightforward English; they wanted you to understand and remember their stories, so you could repeat and document them. I would like to know what was Toni Morrisons point for writing Beloved ."
1,Not one of my most beloved books,"Having seen part of the movie on TV, but never able to catch the whole thing but wanting to, I had high expectations for this book. I eagerly checked it out of the library - only to be disappointed thoroughly. For the most part, this book was extremely boring and at times hard to understand. It took me several readings to finally get the ending, and even then I was puzzled. To put it bluntly, it was just too weird for my tastes. I certainly don't understand how this book could have possibly won a Nobel. And I certainly hated Sethe, who killed her child to spare her a life of slavery and racism. Don't get me wrong: I am not a racist and I believe that slavery was the darkest point in American society and history. But I can't believe a mother would actually kill her own baby due to slavery. Just one of the many things I can't believe or understamd about this book."
4,"Chilling, thought-provoking and lyrical all-in-one","Toni Morrison never disappoints me. Although few of her stories are truly happy ones, I am always pleased with her sheer excellence and the heart-wrenching stories of her characters.I finish with a feeling of knowing her a little better. Morrison is one among millions."
2,Appreciating over time,"The first time I read this book, I despised it. So I was not too pleased when I found out I would have to read it for another college course a few years later. Well, when I read it the second time, I enjoyed it more. It made more sense, and it was easier to figure out. I think this is one of those books that need multiple readings to get it completely. I also found more meaning in it when I read it looking for human rights violations for a human rights course rather than just reading it for a literature class. This book really is very powerful and gives a very strong message about the long-lasting effects of slavery on the human body and mind. Still, not my favorite. I will not read it for a third time and I refuse to like it on a personal level."
4,A Beloved Book In My Mind,"I think this book is wonderful and it you haven't read it you should. I had to read it for a class assignment but I'm glad that I did. This book is great for anyone who wants to learn about African-American slave culture or anyone who just wants a good book to read. It shows the injustices and though choices slaves were confronted with everyday. The book makes you thankful for all the blessings you have in your life. So next time you're bored and need something to do before you reach for the TV remote, reach for Beloved."
5,Faulkner's South from the other side of the Tracks,"Now a motion picture and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, this story is the view of Faulkner's South from the other side of the railroad tracks. Like most classics it deals with history, trauma and healing, survival and memory. The main character (Sethe) is, as usual in a Morrison book, a Black Woman writ Big with conflicts with her past, with the slave society she was born into, with the crossing to freedom, and with the birth of her infant daughter whom she kills rather than surrender to the slave masters. Whether that daughter returns as a ghost or not doesn't matter much. My feeling is that everything, or almost everything, about Beloved is explainable without supernatural intervention. Advice: Read this for the poetry and the insight into black culture and for the reduction of slavery into one woman's poignant story. Then suffer through the movie. Then reread the book and appreciate it for what it really is: A redemptive work of art."
3,A good book that's hard to enjoy.,"Beloved is indeed a masterfully written novel--the composition is excellent, the prose is beautiful, and the characters are well-developed. However, the imagery and symbolism that is often used (and more often overused) is at times hard to stomach. The story, while very intriguing, is often hard to follow and is very often so gratuitously...well...I guess ""disgusting"" is a good word for it...that the reader is often tempted to skip chapters of redundant shock-imagery.Nonetheless, it is still a good read. You might be thinking ""How exactly can it be so good and so bad at the same time?"" Well, I have found that many novels can be very taxing to the reader, and sort of gives you the sensation of being hit by a train. But after you read this sort of novel, you're quite glad you did. That's Beloved in a nutshell. Don't read this book if you want to be entertained. Read it if you want to be bruised, sickened and greatly disturbed."
4,"Incredibly confusing, but good","I just finished reading this book for my English 10 GT class. My first reaction to it was that it wasn't that good. I was very confused on many issues. I thought that there were a lot of open ends. But, I asked my teacher what Beloved symbolized, and she said ""Freedom from slavery"". As soon as she said that, all of the open ends immidiatly closed and the pieces fit together. But I find it frustrating not being able to understand what is going on while I read. It changes the effect of the book. It was very sad, though, reading about what the slaves went through, and some still are (though - thank your God not as many). Over all - a good book"
4,This book is a must to read.,"Beloved, a book written by Toni Morrison, truly is a fascinating piece of literature. Throughout the book, Morrison truly depicts the reality of slave life in the 1800s. Sethe, the main character, Denver, Paul D., and the ghost (Sethe's dead baby) Beloved, work together to mix a fascinating ghost story filled with action and suspense, with a story showing the life of a group of slaves on the Sweet Home plantation. The story of Beloved unwinds slowly and methodically with much detail and imagery. Personally, Beloved is a wonderful story which I hope you read. You too will experience the satisfaction of a truly extraordinary piece of literature."
5,"hauntingly, achingly beautiful","I do not believe that I have ever been as moved by a piece of writing as Beloved and as a English Literature student that is no mean feat. Those, and as I see there are a few of you, who believe that the horrors which African-American slaves were subjected to are 'insignificant' should firstly be ashamed by their ignorance and secondly stick to reading the second class 'literature' that they are so obvoiusly used to. Beloved touched my soul and its words, I believe will haunt me always. This is the first of Morrison's works that I have read but it will certainly not be the last."
4,A emotional and very tragic story of life lossed,"I first read Toni Morrison's book in 1988 after it had won the Pulitzer, I must admit when I first read it, I hated it, I did'nt get it at all, since that time I read other books by her and thought they were great, so I decided to read Beloved again, I'm glad I did, I paid closer attention to the plot and the charaters in the book, and I was very much surprise, It was emotional and so totatlly tragic, that it moved me to tears, I could understand Beloved's outrage, I have alot of compassion and understanding for the ghost. Slavery was not the issue here, at least it was'nt for me, it was about a life being taken, and the events that led up to that death, Morrison is a gifted writer, can't wait to read her next book."
4,"Educating, yes. Entertaining, maybe.","Personally stories in the slavery time period have never interested me all that much. But I enjoyed Toni Morrison's symbolize,writing style and word usage. Some of Beloved's incoherent babbling was interesting yet unsettling. The book focused on all of the individuals lives and not just centerlized on on person. These characteristics made the book more interesting. As I said before I enjoyed the writing but not so much the subject matter."
4,this book gave a face to history,"I personally think is one of the better books I've read especially at school. It was an excellent depiction of what is was like to be a slave.The agony they experienced came to life with her vivid description of the characters and events of their past and present. It gave more understanding to their history than any history book could ever do!! I really enjoyed how Morrison left things unexplained in the beginning and slowly made it clear. It forced you to remember back to what you had read before.The storline itself was excellent. I also enjoyed the fact that all of the slaves stayed together after they left Sweet Home, and were able to share their livess with one another.I only wished that Beloved would have been able to with the family she had lost at such a young age. It was powerful in every direction that it went. I really enjoyed it!!!"
3,A memorable book.,"""Beloved"" was my first Toni Morrison book ever, and to be honest, I was greatly surprised by her writing style. The way that she writes, her style, is very different from previous authors I have read, and I like it. This novel was one that helped me understand how slavery affected real people. It made everything more personal, unlike the numbers in history books. I'm not sure that I had a specific favorite part in the book, though I did enjoy reading about the life that Halle and Sethe had had together before they split up. I'm not sure if I would ever have read this book unless I had to in my 12th grade AP English class. I'm glad that I read it, though I didn't like all of the book. I hope everyone learns something when they've finished reading, like I have."
