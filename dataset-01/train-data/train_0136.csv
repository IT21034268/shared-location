3,Good bellydance workout,"This bellydance video offers a good, fun, workout. It is not a good instructional video for traditional bellydance moves. It would be a good companion to a traditional bellydance dvd."
1,"Don't waste your time or money, don't work!","I purchased the water quality test kit to test my water for the advertized water tests.I tested two water samples from different properties. Both tests came out the same, showing good tests, low hardness 0-50 , iron free or 0, copper 0 safe, nitrate/nitrite 0. I followed the instructions to the letter and used a timer. The results should have should some type of hardness & or Iron contents, because I have rusty stains and black slim in all the toilet tanks.I will now have the water tested by professionals. I need to know how to treat the water before spending a lot of money on a water treatment system. If you are looking to do the same? Don't use this water test kit!Phil in Sparta, MI."
1,Mis-Lead,"Front of Package:""Free Lead in Water Test Kit - See Details Inside the Package"" (look at the image)Ok, opened the package, not seeing this Lead test kit.Whats this? A business reply card - no postage necessary.This was a card to mail in to receive a free lead test kit mailed to you within 2 weeks.Wait 2 weeks for the test, then mail in the sample.To get the results you must pay $30!I received a letter from the city stating that a small percentage of homes built in my area, in the time frame my home was built, may have higher than acceptable levels of lead. So I go to the store to buy a kit specifically for lead, and the clerk points to this one - ""cool,"" I thought, ""I get the lead test for free, and can go ahead and test for the other stuff too."" Totally mislead. Costs a month of time and $30 to get your lead test results. Don't fall for their clever ruse.If you need a lead kit, don't buy this."
2,Not exactly what I expected.,"This test advertised in its description that it included:pH, total alkalinity, total chlorine, total hardness, iron, copper, nitrates, and nitrites. Includes 2 of each test, and bonus tests for hydrogen sulfide and iron bacteria. With the exception of the hydrogen sulfide and iron bacteria, many kits offered this same list of tests. The reason I bought this specific kit was that it did advertise the hydrogen sulfide and iron bacteris ""bonus tests"", and I needed to know levels of those specifically in determining the type of filters and/or oxidation system to purchase. Well, much to my disappointment, the two ""bonus tests"" were simply instructions to smell your water, and look in your toilet tank. This didn't help me quantify the levels of contaminants, and I now need to go spend more money on tests to determine those levels."
4,Works as advertised but not terribly precise,This test kit is easy to use and does work as advertised but reading the results is rather subjective as the color matching is difficult to do with any amount of precision.For us it was all we needed because we were just looking for an idea as to whether or not we need a water softener system AND filtration or just one or the other.If you need something giving you more of a precise range this is not the product for you. But if you want a general idea with a broad range of variability this is worth the nominal cost.
5,The greatest CD that no one is listening to...,"I haven't heard a CD this good in a long time. It always surprises me that a CD this good by a band this innovative never gets played on the radio and never gets the publicity it deserves. I was lucky. I found this CD at my public library, brought it home and have been playing it ever since; sometimes I even sing-along! Each track is a great mixture of House, Rock, Techno but has very laid-back elements so listeners are never overwhelmed with beats.You can be lucky too, buy this CD and listen to it."
1,Disappointing. . .,"I bought this CD just by chance - I had found it at a big warehouse sell-off on Industrial rd. in Ottawa for $2. Some supplier probably bought dozens thinking that Tubthumper was popular, so why not Readymades? Well, were they sure mistaken.This CD is terrible. Now, terrible is subjective, but if liked WYSIWYG or even Tubthumper, you will be sorely dissapointed. The CD is full of acoustic guitar and mundane harmless lyrics. The jacket has some interesting quotes, but otherwise, this CD is not worth your time."
3,Have to disagree,"Judging from the rave reviews here, and the fact that I have enjoyed almost all of their previous work, I wasted no time in picking this up. However, I must sadly write a dissenting opinion here. Hearing that this album hit a softer note was not bad news - some of my favorites in their past work included ""One by One,"" ""Look no Strings"" and ""Dumbing Down."" However, even though I am older by far than their average fan, I have always enjoyed the energy, the impertinence, and the ability to write a song that grabs you immediately. All of that is lacking here. On the whole, it sounds like the soundtrack to an Imax movie. I wish I could have said better, but it just didn't click with me."
3,Europop Subversives,"It's too easy to dismiss Chumbawumba as ""one-hit wonders"". The fact that these Leeds anarchists had a hit at all is a wonder! That single, ""Tubthumper"", was on a weak album. The post-success What You See... was the sound of idealists breaking down their beliefs in the face of money's power: it was fragmentary, schizophrenic, and pretty damn funny. (It sold squat.) A bright release with a subversive undertow, Readymades Euro-pop is smooth as a baby's [butt] - all sheer synthesizers, light shuffling rhythms, gorgeous harmonies. From the ship's mutiny in the opener ""Salt Fare, North Sea"", through ""If It Is to Be, It Is Up to Me""'s call to overthrow the monarchy, to the child laborers of ""Sewing Up [stuff]"" (""working for The Gap!""), Chumbawumba use pop's plasticity to put forth their leftist politics. Alice Nutter's supremely melodic vocals help them go down easy. They may have another hit in them yet."
3,"Great concept, bad aproach","Dr Mastria concept is genuine,useful and in one word: great.To find a single cure and cause for all the soul maladies. Indeed a very practical, almost revolutionarie, aproach. The thing is that the book itself is not a good vehicle for these great ideas. Poor editing, chaotic organization of chapters and (maybe in an intent of making the book more enjoyable) a fixation in Dr. Mastria's story instead of his discovery make of it a dull reading. The writing is very confusing. You have to read the book a few times to find the very simple things he wants to say. He seems mistified for his own discovery and its importance, which is kind of anoying. I'm sure a class or a conversation with the author would be a lot more interesting and enlightening.In short, I found his ideas are really worthy and helpful. But, in my opinion, next time he should hire someone to help him write them down."
2,Disappointing,"I love this piece of music as much as any I have ever known. The orchestra on this recording is fantastic. The tempos and the long Brahms musical lines are great. The soloists are first rate, especially Van Dam. However, I think this is one of the saddest and sloppiest choral recordings ever released. The soprano section of the choir sings half steps flat in many places throughout the first movement. I had to change tracks it was so terrible. The opening mens section (sounding like it's plus women) of the second movement is also out of tune. Poor choral singing throughout. Very sad. It is amazing to me that this recording ever made it to the public. I'm just happy I spent a very small amount for the MP3 download. I would have been very irritated had I spent full price for such sloppy work."
1,A cautionary note...,"This is one time when you are better off reading the back cover of the book than the front cover. The front cover says that the book is a ""beginner's guide."" The back cover indicates, correctly, that the book is a beginner's guide for those *already* familiar with Western astrology. This book is not an appropriate choice for an absolute novice, no matter how wonderful the book may be otherwise."
1,Clear Dissapointment ! Demo CD doesn't run on Win XP,The demo CD that came along with the book couldn't run on Windows XP. I was dissapointed. I was hoping that I can apply the charts to the contents of the book.Wish I could return and get a full refund or resell at a low price of USD5/-.
1,Buyer Beware,I received this book a few weeks ago and tend to agree with much of what the 1-Star reviewers have said- the book does not seem geared for a beginner and the CD attached at the back is out of date and there is no reply from the email address given. I did however ring and got an email address for Mr Levancy who directed me onto a web-site whose program raised my hopes but then it stuck and I never got back a reply- so I would tend to believe this is a 'con' job whose only purpose is to raise hopes and money for the author.
4,A good beginner book,"For newcommers to the vedic approach to astrology this book is a good choice. It is well structured and written in a clear language. Levacy gives a taste of many important things on the subject and he explains in details how to get further in your vedic studies including a list of good books for intermediate students. I myself think it's a good idea to learn how to calculate a chart because you learn a lot about what's going on ""up there"", but Levacy realises that we are living in a computer age so he includes a calculation program and don't tell very much about calculations at all. That's his point of view and that's ok. A good book."
3,Interested in Updated CD,"We have the book but there are no Versions of Updated CD's that are compatible with the Windows 7 Operating System.As a result, we can not read our charts. Would like this to be user friendly."
1,Clear disappointment,"A beginner's guide? Yeah sure. Yes, the book tells what the Vedic astrology is all about, but then it is only descriptions for different houses, signs etc. It says, that with the book you are ready to draw charts Vedic way, but what if you don't have knowledge of the algorithms needed to draw charts. The book comes with a bonus CD that includes a demostration(!) version of a software that can draw a chart automatically. It smells like that the book's author wants you to buy the full version of the software and without that, the book is quite worthless. I don't like the author's attitude at all."
4,A great quick reference.,This is a well organised book with no 'fat'. It is accessible and trim and the information is what you need when doing a reading for yourself or someone else. Earthy and insightful it gives a real 'picture' with each aspect.
2,Lacks Examples,"I bought this book a few months back. It is a good read. It helps you with the basic concepts. Not too thrilled with the attached software. There are better ones out there (free).The primary drawback of this book is that there are no examples to elucidate the concepts. What the author should have done was for each of the topics, use an actual horoscope and explained the concepts from there. This way one gets a better understanding of astrology.So now I am on the lookout for another book that has some examples."
4,Very Good Read for Young Adults,"I have given this book to one of the young people in our ministry. I plan to purchase a couple of additional copies to give to a couple of the other Young Women in our ministry. The book hit on a lot of subjects that pertain to teenagers in our churches today. The book was not a difficult read at all, but told the truth about life and the consequences to our decisions."
5,Great from start to finish.,"This is a quick, easy read and I can relate to this book. My parents run a small, family business and we waste so much time and money to try and sort our way through all of this nonsense when we should be coming up with ideas to be more productive. After you read this book, you realize how much of a strain this puts on everyone."
5,Extraordinary,"This slim volume confirms the old axion that ""good, if brief, twice as good"".The graphic examples of how irrational government can be when applying nonsensical regulations lead us to the conclusion that we better avoid if at all possible to deal with governmental authorities."
1,Common sense is over rated,"Sorry folks, after reading this book, I must say, ""common sense"" is over rated, since in appealing to ""common sense"" we have already formed a general concept of what it means to think."
3,Good but dry,"The thesis of the book seems to be sound on it's face, but Howard skimps on details on how to solve the problems he laments... and he laments a lot. Much of the book is filled with various dry examples of systemic dysfunction in order to illustrate the author's point. This gets especially bad in the final chapters of the book -- where he devotes exactly one chapter discussing how he would structure law so that bureaucrats can perform their jobs effectively.The problem with his approach is that extensive oversight would be required and corrupt individuals would still be able to do what they want. Whether or not this would be better than the status quo is pretty much left as an exercise for the reader."
2,Endless rant,"Howard should have borrowed from Dennis Miller and started the book with ""I don't mean to go on a rant here, but..."" and then proceeded with his 187 pages of endless whining about how horrible the law is in America.The examples given (about how law is suffocating America) are sometimes right on the mark and at other times not as well defined. Less would have been more. His ideas of how to fix this dilemma are also good...if we lived in a perfect world. Unfortunately, we don't. With no practical solutions and a message lost amongst a myriad of words, I woudn't recommend this book to anyone but Ted Kazinski."
3,It's okay,"Not bad, but just too obvious. I suppose as an introduction to someone recovering from a desire for Government regulation it mayh be helpful."
2,AC Home charger+car charger review,"I purchased this product on August 2 2012, the usb and wall charger work perfectly but the car charger was made from very cheap plastic and was already broken in the package. I was very dissapointed with the material used for the car charger."
1,Junk,"This is complete junk.First; The car charger tip broke off on 2nd use and shorted out my cars electrical system, for the charging ports and other stuff. After looking at the parts dug out of charging port it was obvious the charger internals were assembled wrong, shorted out internally and trashed the components involved.Second; The USB cord pulled apart at the MP3 player end. Nothing seemed to be sonically welded or glued together. Same for car charger.I haven't used the house charger. I'm afraid to.Third; The Vendor insists I return this junk before replacing it. Which would be fine if the additional shipping didn't nearly double the cost of the product."
1,DID NOT WORK!!!,Bought this to take overseas for my cousin who had lost her Zune charger. Get all the way there and to our great disappointment the charger DID NOT WORK!!!! UGH. The wall plug works fine but the cable to charge the Zune does not. Do not buy!!!
2,Try something else for your car,"If you were going to use this product for the car charger like I was, do not waste your time. I used it and my car started smelling odd. Brand new and out of the package, the charger was overheating and stinking everything."
2,Tried with 8GB zune,"The charger doesn't work, i'm using only the USB cable. When I plug it never start to charge, the Zune detects that it's connected but nothing happens"
1,"LOUSY PRODUCT, DON'T BUY!","I'm from Asia & purchased this & had someone else deliver it here. Anyway, the 1st time I used this the red light turned on but went out soon after without charging the zune. Tried it again a few days after, it still won't charge. So basically I bought a broken charger that didn't work the 1st time I got it! No way can I return it now from all the way here, LOUSY PRODUCT, DON'T BUY!"
3,It does what I bought it for,"Really, I only bought this item because I had lost the original cord for my Zune. I really only needed something I could use to charge and load files onto the device with. The adapters were just perks as far as I was concerned. The cord works, it charges the device and enables the computer to recognize it and transfer files.However, the AC wall adapter does not charge the Zune. It charges everything else that uses usb like my phone and a portable speaker, but it does nothing for the Zune except freeze the device when it gets unplugged. Not sure why and I don't really care either. Oh, and the car charger works for my phone and I haven't tried anything else with it."
2,You get what you pay for.,You get what you pay for. I only used the cord maybe 5 times before the part that connects to the port on my Zune broke.
2,Sadly disappointed,"I left my original Zune cord at school, and I got reallly excited for having multi-purpose usb wall/car chargers as well as a replacement cord for my zune, but it seems it was too good to be true. I plugged my Zune into my laptop, and at first it connected but would not sync (not a normal problem for my 30gb Zune with the other cord). Hoping I was experiencing a software problem, I uninstalled and reinstalled the Zune software; when I checked on my Zune after a few hours connected to the computer, however, it would not turn on. I keep it charged with the Zune radio transmitter in my car, so it's pretty strange that it should go from 100% to 0% while connected to a power source (my laptop)--of course I never had this problem with my original cord, and it's looking like I'll be waiting until fall to sync my music."
2,Okay for a quick fix bundle but I'd look elsewhere.,"I've bought this set a while ago so I thought I would leave my views on how it held up.First, unfortunately I lost the AC adapter so I can't say much about it.The Zune cable itself worked but it never set correctly into the base port, I could even insert it upside down if I'm not careful. I'd recommend using it with a Zune dock so any risk of damage is reduced.The car adapter was extremely flimsy and fell apart after being left in the glove box when not used.Overall if you need a quick fix and a spare Zune cable it's not to bad in that regard. But I also say spend the extra money and get something that is built better."
4,Satisfied with MS Zune sync-N-Charge USB charger kit,"I received this product rather quickly. Previous reviews indicated that the construction was ""you get what you pay for"". I as actually very happy with my purchase. I wasnt really interested in purchasing a high-end adapter as I wasnt sure if there was an issue with the Zune player or connections. At any rate, I will purchase a back-up cable from this seller. Thank you!"
4,Excellent Value,Only minor complaint is that the Zune Device itself may pick up some hum when placed too close to the charger -- but it does not have to be more than a couple of feet away to avoid this.
4,Nice and cheap,"Well, basically you get what you pay for ! Can't expect much with this cheap and nice charging solution comes with both travel and car charger adapter , and also a usb cable. You can choose to charge using your pc or laptop using the usb cable."
4,zune,"Received product in a very timely manner and before Christmas too!!! Very satisfied with my order, thank you very much!!!"
2,No car charger,"The picture and description are deceiving. It says that it comes with a car charger and shows it in the picture; however, it does NOT come with it. It was only a wall charger with a USB cable that plugs into the charger and the computer. I had to buy the car charger separately."
2,Zune charger,"Bestbuy doesn't carry zune accessories anymore and my mom stole my original charger so I need to get a new one. I saw this and read that there were some great reviews about it and it was a bargain... sigh, the saying is right, you get what you pay for. I just took it out of the package to try it out with my zune because it needs to be charged and I can tell a light needs to turn on when charging. It didn't turn on, I tried it in different outlets. Then I tried the sync cord and connected it to the computer... wouldn't even register on the computer. Next I tried the car charger, and that is the only reason why I gave this item 2 stars instead of 1 star. The car charger actually worked though a bit flimsy, it will work in a pinch. The product I got doesn't even look like the picture. I would not suggest buying this."
4,good,pretty cheap for off brand. works good. had it for about a month and no problems. you get what you pay for.
1,nothing but pieces,Received this item 2 weeks later than promised. Came in pieces needless to say does not work even some parts missing that were apparently broken from plugin.would like replacement and explanation . So far blane as of yet.
4,great product package,"Everything in package works as expected, great price, even with a small shipping snafu that was taken care immediately. very pleasant experience,would purchase through this company again and recommend others to do so also"
4,Gets the job done,"The USB cable seems to be pretty well-made, but the car and A/C adapters feel a little flimsy to me. Had some trouble with getting the A/C adapter to work, but worked fine when I gave it a little force making the commection. All in all, it's actually pretty decent for what I paid."
2,zune carger cheap,MY wall charger shorted out the same day as I recieved it. The car charger works fine. I guess that's the trade off for cheap items.
4,Not as pictured,"I recently purchased this item and the product I received was slightly different than as pictured. I received a computer connection cord, seperate car charger that is corded, and seperate wall charger which is corded. The picture shows interchanging the cord between chargers, this is not the case. I think I like what I received better than what I thought I was purchasing, so all works out in the end. Also had timely shipping!"
2,u get what u pay for,It isn't a zune product like it shows which would be ok if it hadn't fell apart. It Works ok but the part that connects to my zune fell apart exposing the wires.
4,Not bad for nearly nothing.,"The adapter that plugs into the power outlet fell apart just a few days of having it. I was able to pop it back together real quick. Other than that, the charger is not bad for what I paid for it."
2,Not worth my money,I believe this product is cheap for a reason. While the cable itself works for charging my Zune while directly connected to my computer or XBOX getting it to connect to the computer for updates or adding music is a hassle. You need to jiggle the cable around or unplug it a few times before it's recognized. Another huge issue was the car charger. It doesn't work at ALL! It worked the first two times I plugged it into my car and now it won't even charge my Zune at all - even after the Zune dies this car charger won't even get it to turn back on even though it says plugged in. Totally worthless piece and this was all I really ordered it for. Now it is only useful for charging through the cable directly into my computer or XBOX. I wouldn't buy this specific product again.
2,Basic,"Did the basic, but was not happy with the car adapter charger. It is cheap and is almost falling apart."
1,DIDN'T FIT,So I get the product very excited only to find that it doesn't fit the Zune. Sending it back not happy at all. Great price though wrong plug.
2,You get what you pay for...,"One word- Cheap. The actual items do not look like the picture. Plus, when I first put the one end into my zune it wouldn't come back out!! I was so nervous! I had to use pliers to get it out because the one tab on the side wouldn't push in all the way to release it. After that I haven't had any problems...but we'll see."
4,A Doctor's Report,"In 1950 Joseph Winter was involved with the Dianetics movement, but became disgruntled with a few aspects and decided to move on. Although this book does criticize a few aspects of Dianetics, it also supports it as the author recounts his success in helping people with it. This book was written in 1951, a few years before Scientology became a religion."
4,SuPerDeLuXe,"I love the voice of Miki very much. Great songs, well performed, and that's what count !"
3,disappointing,"While this is not as bad as some would have you believe, it is, nonetheless a disappointment. The main problem is that the songs and arrangements (particularly background vocal arrangements) are generally so pedestrian that not even Miki's (occasional) bursts of passion can really lift them above the ordinary. It doesn't have the complete mis-fires that were on 1996's Can't Count Me Out but neither are there any true gems that could be found on her earlier work."
1,Howard Should Have Wished Harder,"When I heard that Miki Howard was finally going to release a CD of new material after a lenghty hiatus, I was truly excited. Because Howard was one of the better R&B female vocalists to emerge in the 80's, I knew I would be in for a treat. Man, was I wrong.I was mortified when I heard this CD! It's such a pity to have a talent like Howard wasted on such bland material and poor production. And Miki gives a lack-luster performance on every song, a far cry from the soul-stirring performances on her 80's Atlantic CDs.I know Howard has had many personal problems over the past several years. Hopefully, she will come to her senses and go with another record company who will team her with far more qualified songwriters and producers and we can once again hear the Miki Howard we all remember and loved from the 80's."
5,Die Fledermaus/Gypsy Baron CD,Die Fledermaus has long been a favourite of mine and this CD coupled with highlights from the Gypsy Baron makes it outstanding. I'm thoroughly enjoying listening to it. Judy
2,Out of balance,This hair dryer does not balance well when placed on a table or desk and will easily tip over if unattended. This problem comes for the first time after using the Hot Tools label over the past 25 years.
4,"Old-fashioned, '70s-style Brazilian jazz fusion","Rio-born, San Francisco-based vocalist Claudia Villela scats and croons her way through a fine set of glossy, '70s-fusion tinged tunes, very reminiscent of Flora Purim's work with Airto Moreira and their modern jazz clique. Multi-instrumentalist Ricard Peixoto guides an able, retro-oriented band. Jazz elder Toots Thielemans plays his harmonica on a couple of tunes, lending an air of utter authenticity to the proceedings. This style isn't for everyone (I'm personally not fond of it), although the musicianship is of a high calibre; Villela is most striking on more focused, conventional melodies, although her uptempo scatting produces several dazzling passages, with lightning-fast phrasing that puts her at the top of the game. Several tunes are a bit meandering and tinny, but others have real lyrical depth. Fans of old-school fusion will be dazzled to hear the music alive and well in the new century; other listeners may want to tread more lightly."
5,Brave Brazilian New Wave of Jazz,"This sensationally composed, performed and engineered recording pulls you into a sonic landscape of often wordless vocals and sensuous guitar. Caravana is my favorite track. Villela's unique style of straight-toned improvisation and quiet intensity is beautiful, especially when she wails (rarely) against a swell of Middle Eastern instruments. A brave Brazilian new wave."
4,Works fine. Too bad the bluetooth headset needs this thing so often.,"This thing charges the headset appropriately. The headset needs this thing entirely too often.The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cord isn't really conducive to actually having it plugged in while its in your ear.If your headset needs charging as much as mine you may often find yourself wishing (but not prefering) to use the headset with this thing actually plugged in while youre using it.The cord on this thing is one of the spiral type stretch cords, but its still to short (and kinda heavy) to really use it comfortably with the headset in your ear."
5,Convenient,"Recharging the cell phone headset in the car is great. Charging is very fast. This is a great convenience, very well priced."
3,Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad... but kinda good.,"What needs to be said about a movie that features toothy man-eating slugs? If that idea alone doesn't have you shelling out money for the disc, nothing will. Yes, the premise is silly, the dialogue is terrible, and nobody in the film can act to save their lives. However, these are not neccessarily reasons to dislike it - in fact, these are the reasons it's so enjoyable. This is a movie that one would expect to see on Mystery Science Theater 3000 except it doesn't need Mike and the bots to keep it entertaining. The movie is funny enough without them."
1,Get the bug spray,"Poor acting and the term over-dramatic just doesn't say enough. I won't even talk about how slow you have to be moving to escape Slugs. However, if you're into the old B movies I've seen worse."
2,Poor quality Chinese made rotor,"I found out the hard way that OEM in this case does not stand for Original Equipment Manufacturer, but rather Original Engine Management. The part is about as crappy as they come. Go to the dealer if you want the best parts. Some things are to important to save a few dollars on. Cut corners somewhere else."
5,"A fun book, a joy to read","Don't get hung up on fact vs. fiction. If you want to know the backstory on this book, read ""Martial Musings""(come to think of it, read it even if you don't). I pull this book out whenever I want to relax. I know I sound too much like a beer commercial when I say it's light, fun, and goes down smooth. Smith's writing style ( I've not revealed any secrets here, have I?) is somewhat reminiscent of Mark Twain. He weaves a tale well, peppering his prose with apt quotes and deadly accurate observations. Don't buy this book to learn how to wipe out your neighborhood, buy this book to sit back and smile."
3,"It's a hoot! Delightful, unabashed horse manure.","Reminds me of a cartoon of a guy standing on a chair and holding his pant legs up as high as he could; the caption read, ""Now, go on with your story."" Much of it is obviously contrived: the men allegedly interviewed around the world all speak fluent English, use similar mannerisms, and quote American statesmen! LOLAs a teenage martial arts fan I thought this book was riveting. Now I wonder if anyone really believes the account of the ""Parisian Halitotic Attack"" (bad breath attack).Read magellan359's review for a theory on who's behind the pseudonym. The picture of ""Don Eagle"" on page 134 bears a striking resemblance to the Donn on the back of the ""Practical Karate"" series of books. My rating is an average: 1 (lowest) as a training book, 5 for being a howl --a collection of shaggy dog stories."
3,NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS!!!!!!1,"It doesn't show you 20 secret moves! Some of them are just people, and one isn't even a fighting method at all! Another one is about an incident that he witnessed, and that he wants to find a certain person! You won't become the ultimate fighter with this book!!!!"
4,Interesting & amusing,"Some of the techniques used by practisioners would be difficult to use on a daily basis, if you wanted to remain a part of society. For example, the Parisian Halitotic Attack, would only work your society deems punishingly bad breath OK.Overall, a good read."
4,A heart-warming story full of adventure,"Fantasy, reality, and mystery are interwoven in this heart-warming tale embracing all the human emotions from sorrow to joy, fear to bravery, humor to earnestness. Family and friends are challenged to solve riddles, face dangers, and pull together in a qwest to save two worlds from menacing evil."
4,Give me My Mind,"My mind is an open book honey... I love this song! Sorry Jimi but I don't like your low-tone voice. Besides that the cd is awesome! It's groove and jazzy and noisy and so calm when needed. The inclusion of chorus' is just amazing, and there are songs like I've been looking for from the previous albums...like Never Say it Loud and Outta Space. My god this is a rich cd in all its ways. This is the kind of artists that make me feel good about synths, where the muusician is indeed a musician and not a guy with no musical knowledge. Great Jimi! Keep 'em coming!"
3,Interesting,"I don't totally buy the theory,but the book was well researched and made me think so I will give it three stars.As for previous reviewers, he does base some of his theory on the accounts of an 87 year old and a 91 year old, their brother-in-law/husband was the British Consul,in Ekaterinburg at the time of the murders, and this information was combined with other sources the book is not based entirely on their story.And he never claims she was a belly-dancer, in fact he debunks this (on several occasions) as a fabrication made up by someone around her to cover her real past.As I said I am not totally convinced in his theory but if you want to be critical you could at least get the story straight."
5,Interesting Read,"I was engrossed in this book from the moment I opened it. I had half expected to find it to be wildly speculative and mostly imaginary. I was surprised. This book did not promote the conspiracies, but rather looked at each ""possibility"" with more of a researcher's approach. Obviously not written by someone with their own agenda, but rather a curiosity. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Romanovs."
2,Disapponiting,I have no problem with a little sex and nudity in a horror film but this film was more like a soft core porno horror film. Not my thing. I liked the gore and blood but not the other junk.
4,Nice filter material,The item purchased is for an amazing filter and as a much needed update to my old filter which was slowly dying it works very well. Better I think than the old one ever did
5,elegant chairs!!,"Ordered two sets of these chairs expecting a nice chair for this price.Chairs were much better quality then I expected. The chairs are much heavier in weight than I thought they would be, I don't know if they actually are wrought iron or just a high quality metal, but they certainly have the weight, feel and appearance of wrought iron. The fabric on the cushions is beautiful, heavy weight and compliments the chairs beautifully. My cats immediately tried out their claws on the chair seats after putting the chairs together and were unable to leave a single mark on the fabric. I wasn't sure how comfortable the seat backs would be with the metal scroll work and all, but the angle and the curve of the seatback make this one of the most comfortable dining chairs I have ever had the pleasure of sitting in. I highly recommend these chairs."
2,Cute but not comfortable,The shoes are beautiful when they arrive. However the stripes on top can be felt and actually rubs against the foot in one shoe. Amazon is great about taking the returns.
3,Stiff,"Set in Salem in the early 1800s, Gerrit Ammidon returns home from the Orient with a Chinese bride, Taou Yuen. She is not accepted into Salem society. A degenerate seaman, Edward Dunsock, becomes infatuated with Gerrit's bride; out of a mixture of pride and disgust she commits suicide. Hergesheimer is unable to make Yaou Yuen a real person, and after her suicide Gerrit is not affected by it. This dampens the effect of the tragedy."
1,"Sad, sad, sad...","It's so sad that a recognized leader of an international church can so publicly mutilate the words of God and go virtually unchecked. I found errors and blatant misinterpretations on virtually every page of this book. It was so distressing to me that I could not finish it.The problems began even before the first page... in the very TITLE itself. ""A marvelous Work and a Wonder"", a reference to Isaiah 29:14, is claimed by the author to be a prophecy pointing to Joseph Smith. However, Mat 15:7-8 clearly indicates that this exact same prophecy is specifically fulfilled in Jesus Christ, God in the flesh.The abominable butchering of God's word continues non-stop throughout the first few chapters, and I'm quite certain it continues on throughout... If you are going to read this book, make sure to check out every reference and read each one IN FULL CONTEXT. The overwhelming errors will be plainly apparent."
5,Wonderful resource,We bought this for our missionary's Kindle. It's an excellent book and a good resource for those studying and teaching the gospel.
3,DVI Splitter Cable unable to split @ 100% capacity,Don't bother buying this DVI splitter cable if you want to split the signals to two monitors. You are essentially getting 50% on one monitor and 50% in the other. You are better off purchasing a DVI converter box.
2,not for me.,i wouldnt recommend this splitter if you use a high resolution monitor. i would use a 1680x1050 and little red/greed dots would appear all over my monitor.
1,Wrong kind of DVI,"Description did not state what type of DVI this was.I wanted to hook one DVI up to a projector and one up to a CRT monitor, but it seems this splitter only supports DVI-D and both of my cables are DVI-I which you can not plug into DVI-D connection.The CRT only supports DVI-I even if I would get an adapter. So I'm left with a useless splitter in the end.It would be a good idea to add that this splitter does not support analog cables/connections (DVI-I, DVI-A and CRT's for example)."
1,maybe correct splitter but DOES NOT WORK EVEN ON 6 FEET.,"maybe correct splitter but DOES NOT WORK EVEN ON 6 FEET.I have a signal booster on the 50-ft part, but even on6 ft I got no picture and then my computer would notstart after I took it off. I wanted to test it again,but do not think it is a good idea. I not goingto spend $50 dollars to buy signal booster for 6 feet.o well I want to keep from taken the two wires, oneto 50ft of video for Nexflix in living with signal booster,and one for the monitor/TV in bedroom. nothing to do."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the book on the picture and I got something diferent, the same title and author, but the content was way off, I asked my professor what edition the book was and if we could still use it, she had no Idea what the book was and it didn't contain anything that we were using in class."
4,Great Missal Book,"My father gave me his from his childhood and I wore it, still use it but not as much due to its condition now.I bought this one to replace it and figure how to scan it in pdf.I enjoy the Latin and English version side by side and find it as a better missal than the one used today by churches."
4,Might be overkill,"So thorough it might be too much for some. But thanks to the precise organization & many lists of principles, a selective reader can sail through to needed topics."
3,NOT for Dummies,"Maybe a little too technical for mere casual reading. Comes off to me sort of like a college textbook - a little more of a difficult read. Good book,though."
1,Strategic Planning for Dummies,"Unfortunately, Malphurs has again published a book that far underestimates his readers. Advanced Strategic Planning does little more than lay out the basics of strategic planning; issues of greater consequence are left untouched. Dealing with entropy in an organization is a serious issue that Malphurs seems to believe goes away if one's vision/goals/strategy are rightly aligned. I was disappointed with this book. Better to wait for Post-Advanced Strategic Planning."
3,"Good Book, Manufacturing Defect","Imagine my frustration: here I am settling down comfortably to begin reading Malphurs' book - something I have been looking forward to doing for some time. I turn to the Appendix pages and find a whole bunch of pages missing!I could return it to Amazon - but I bought the book over 30 days ago and Amazon's return policy does not allow me to return a book beyond 30 days!I think Malphurs' book is good - though elementary in many ways. But the manufacturing defect has, as they used to say, really got my goat! What am I to do now? Is someone at Amazon going to help me out?"
2,Disapointing,"The author develops a series of ideas about ethical and moral issues in a very shallow unsystematic way. It's not really a scientific autobiography, more a collection of personal memories and opinions. The first assay is probably the only remotely interesting as it covers the first years of the development of the quantum mechanical theory, the rest is absolutely expendable."
5,This is one of the best singles money can buy!,"Judgement Day is one of my favorite Wu-member tracks of all-time...and the other songs/video that accompany that song on here are just as amazing. Dangerous Grounds was one of my favorite cuts on Tical 2000, and then u have Release YO Delf. That's my favorite song from Tical other than Bring Da Pain. The video was blown up when the single first dropped. It was one of the tightest music videos I've seen yet. Method Man has always been undderrated and appreciated by few. Below is my track rating (1-5):1. Judgement Day - 52. Dangerous Grounds - 4.53. Release Yo Delf - 54. Judgement Day Video - 5"
2,11 position switch - not continuous,Beware this volume control has 11 preset steps. It is not continuously variable. In my opinion it's a bit expensive for something made in Tiaiwan.PRO: It has three different color face plates and knobs.
4,Perfect for my country kitchen,"I am all about the stars and the primitive country decor! This is very well-made, arrived super fast, and is so cute!"
5,love this paper towel holder,"This paper towel holder is simple and pretty and easy to refill. I love that it's made in the USA in Amish country, and was even packaged in PA newspaper. It was exactly what I was looking for!"
2,Not what I expected,"I expected a heavy gauge of metal. Star is too big will not fit under cabinet and star is top heavy, falls over alot."
4,Needs patience but worth it,"The Heart of Midlothian (Oxford World's Classics)In high school I read The Talisman and Ivanhoe and loved them both. This book is not that type of adventure story and is not always so accessible because of the dialect dialog. That, however, does not detract from the plot and characterizations. Scott does a marvelous job of bringing the major events of the novel to life. The picture of the riot is fantastic. What sets this novel apart for me is how the author is able do bring vividly and realistically to life so many aspects of society from the common folk to the nobility. To read this book in terms of women's rights and the strength that women display in times of trial makes this novel a valuable part of the history of women's place in society."
3,Good example of Scott's work,A tough read but the book is particularily rewarding for the notes in the back. They give a great overview of the life and times of the characters.The note's while being very thorough can be a little convoluted. At least twice I was refererred to notes on notes on notes!!
5,This was terrific!,This book was the best out of the Stonewycke Legacy! The action was fast paced and the charactars enthralling. You can really see how the charactar of Logan and Allison deepen and grow.
4,"Shadows Fall, SIMPLY THE BEST","Alright, i bought this cd because im obsessed over Shadows fall, they are my current favorite band i couldn't imagine not having the cd. Now it got here much sooner than i expected and i was totally excited. When i put it in i read the lyrics along with the song and to be honest at first i wasn't as into it. The music was top of the line, the beginning to Deadworld is really cool. But for one reason or another i wasn't that satisfied. But then i began listening to it without reading the lyrics and it became so much better. Stepping outside of the circle is along the lines of the song Of one blood with a catchy chorus but better. I really recomend this to those of you that can easily afford it. A newbie shoudl try to find the new Europen import ""Fear Will Drag You Down"" becasue it puts this ep on their full length ""of One blood""> Shadows Fall simply is the best."
5,Great watch!,I purchased this for my son's teacher as an end of the school year gift. She loved it. I was very pleased with the quality and it looked great.
1,Wrong sleeves,"The costume came with stars on the sleeves instead of spiderwebs - truly dissapointing. Also, very shapeless, very different than pictured. Would not recommend."
5,Kennedy Rocks!,"These guys are great! My son was in their music video""Who's Lovin' Your Momma"" and they can love me anytime!"
3,Grammy?,"This Album sounds ok. A grammy nomination is kind of pushing it though. It sounds as if everyone was playing to something different. There is no ""meshing"" or blending going on. The voicings in the brass aren't the most pleasing to the ear and the phrasing isn't all that hot, but I guess it's kinda hard with so many horns. There is no drive present...No hard swing. The sound quality is the best thing this CD has to offer, thanx to the master engineer Jon Fausty. This CD sounds decent. It's better than some other stuff thats out there, but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list."
4,Retorno del sonido viejo,Angelito del cielo ... what heavenly sounds you bring me. The cd has a mix of diff tempos. I particularly enjoyed the strong muscianiship and arrangements recalling the fifties. Loved the BIGG FATT Baritone sax!
3,pretty good pictures but not a lot of factual information...,"I thought this book had some good pictures, but I don't think you'll learn much about Sporty Spice from this book. I think this is the same for the entire collection of ""In My Pocket"" books."
4,hmmm...,"the date of her birth was wrong, she was born 1974, not 1976. other than that the book was good!"
2,Very pretty Very fragile,"These are beautiful. We are very careful, and these chip so easily we thought the initial bowls that chipped were somehow defective. They weren't pretty for very long. The glaze doesn't seem to be thick enough to protect the edge."
1,"Broken on arrival, not replaced, docked on $","Got two sets, both broken on arrival, got docked on $$ because returned two times. Left very bad taste for Amazon purchasing."
5,Wonderful Religious Humor,"I am sorry the previous reviewer did not appreciate this book. William Willimon has collected a range of religious humor. It is not meant as sermon material, but for reading and enjoying. Yet, I can easily find some material worthy of sermon illustrations."
5,Mario4thper sco,I think this was a good book and it was very interesting.It was also kinda funny and walter had a lot of funny things to say.
4,"A very good "" Raisin in the Sun!""","This book is extrodinary. It is about a family the Younger's, how in their every day lives they face many obstacles, financially as well as them being African-American, and living in those ""hard times"". I believe that in every family there is a strong arm. The strong arm in the Younger family is Mama who does anything at her reach to make things right. As there is a strong arm there can also be a ""weak"" arm. Walter son of Mama seems to belive that money is everything but as Mama once told him, "" Now money is life, once upon a time freedom use to be life"". Indeed the Younger's are to be admired, for they strive to make every of their dreams come true."
3,A family struggle,A raisin in the sun was a confusing book. This book has an interisting story that describes how the families go through different situations in life. The family Younger had many problems but managed to stay together. The family members had to make different decisions and some brought consequences to the entire family. The same problems that were in the book could be the same problems others may have.
3,"What I think about '' A Raisin in the Sun""","I liked the book ""A Raisin in the Sun"", but not very much. The book dealt with religion, racism, and financial problems. This book is for every family who has gone through those things and they would know what the Younger family was going through. The reason why I didn't like the book a lot is because of the ending. I feel the ending could have been more dramatic; however, still end the way it did. I liked the way Walter had took the responsibility over the money and I thought he was going to do the right things,such as pay for Beneathas medical school, but he didn't and because of Walter not doing the right things it caused conflicts. There were several conflicts in the book and action is what made me want to read more of the book. If my teacher hadn't assigned me to read this book I don't think I would have read it."
5,"""Two Thumbs Up"" to a good book","I thought ""A Raisin In The Sun"" was a great book. It was easy to get into and even harder to put down. The book was about an African-American family, the Youngers, sometime during World War II on Chicago's southside. As the book progresses, more and more about the families financial problems are discovered and their futuere depends on their mother's check of ten-thousand dollars. As bad decisions are made by the Youngers, good things happen to them and racial issues occur to try to hinder them from their dreams.""A Raisin In The Sun"" is a great book. I recommend this book to young adults ranging from ages 14 and up."
4,"Delicious ""Raisin in the Sun"" Grisel Viveros 6th p. English","Indeed ""A Raisin in the Sun"" is very good. I really like the way Lorraine Hansberry expresses this story, it seems so real. She gives a strong personality to each character especially Mama, whom is described as an outstanding women ""husky of voice stout of step, with fists as well as hands"". I recommend this book to anyone who loves reading."
5,A Rasin In The Sun By:Lorraine Hansberry,I think this book was good.This book deals with some real life issues that happen in the world today.The family in this book has to make a lot of choices but they dont think of the consequences that come with the choices they make.At the begining of the book we learned a little about the characters and their life styles.As we go further in the story we learn what kind of choices the characters have to make.Some were bad and some were good.But most of all the choices were bad and had some drastic consequences.
3,A Rasin in the Sun,"The book ""A Rasin in the Sun"" deals with a lot of conflicts including money, racism, love, and trust. The story is about the Youngers, a black family living on the South Side of Chicago. It details the family's different views on what should be done with the ten thousand dollar check. The character Mama wants to buy a house. Her son Walter Lee wants to open a liquor store, and the daughter Beneatha wants to finish her schooling. In each scene, a character is faced with a different decision. The story is written as a play. I personally thought ""A Rasin in the Sun"" was on okay book, and I would tell anybody who loves to read plays to read this story."
4,A Play for the Ages,"Somehow finished high school and college without ever reading this play. Because a retired professor at church offered several weeks discussing the play before a Play Makers Production in Chapel Hill, NC, I put the play on my Kindle. Happy not to have missed this experience all together. Amazing that the young author was able to write about the times and troubles of her race and the universality of the play's many themes."
3,A Raisin In The Sun,"A Raisin In The Sun is a very inspirational play focusing on issues that occur within everyday families. This play shows that even though people can't always achieve their dreams because of the difficulities and obstacles, when the family comes together, the dreams can come true. I really like this play and I think that it has a very characteristic setting reflecting on pride, courage, and confidence."
4,A Raisin in the Sun,This book is a very eye opening book. It teaches you about poverty of a black family in a poor neighborhood in the southside of chicago. This book has many conflicts and hardships that the Younger family faced in the middle 1900's. You should read this book if you are willing to endure some of the hardships that the members of the Younger family have.
3,We liked this book but it was a bit overdramitic!,We liked the book because it talked about serious issues and people acheiving their dreams.like when all the characters had a dream. Mama's dream was to buy a house with a garden and to make her children happy. Ruth's dream is to make a better family life. Beneatha has a dream to become a doctor and to use the money for her college education. Walter's dream is to open up a liquor store to become rich. We didn't like it because it was overdramitic. Some overdramatic scenes were when walter found out willie ran off with the money. Another dramatic scene is when Beneatha and walter do that African dance. Overall it was a pretty good book.
3,Nice for society to reflect...,"This play helps to remind all people where we came from and gives us more reason to appreciate where we are. Beautifully written, and heartfelt. I love the independence and strength of the female characters, especially Mama. I applaud Beneatha's need for more, and Ruth's strength to deal with her husband and any misfortune that is thrown her way. Truly a movable classic. I loved it!"
5,A Raisin In The Sun,"""A Raisin In The Sun"" is a excellent play . I learned a lot from this play and I would recommand the book or movie to anyone. The play is about an African-American family who have slight finicial problems and family dissagreements. Overall I really enjoyed reading the play and learned ever to trust anyone with valuable items."
3,A familly struggle,This book is a good book. This book talks about a family having different goals and dreams. It also talks about the family having different kinds of situations such as financial problems. We saw how some bad decions can bring a problem to another member of the family. There is different motions such as love passion frustration and sadness.
3,A raisin in the Sun,"A Raisin in the Sun was a very good book. It was about a Chicago family that had issues that range from family, generational clashes, and women movement. The author posed question about identity, justice, and moral responsibility. This book was the interplay of the past and present, of wisdom and passion. This book was a good example of how family stick together even through hard times."
3,"Not a very bad book, but not great.",I like the begining of the book when mama received the ten thousands dollars. Also i like when Walter lost the six thousands dollars. But I hate when Walter and the man argue and Benetha complants.I also like the end when walter tell the man and his family that he is moving to the neighborhood. Not a bad book at all.
4,"Captured you, yet there are better","I had to read this book for an english class, but I did like it! it was an amazing use of charachters and setting, and the way they were placed into the plot was amazing. Yet previously, I had read To Kill A Mockingbord. I loved that. It is definately the best book I ever read. They both covered the idea of racism with african-americans, yet TKAMB (To Kill A...) explained it from a white childs point of view, unlike ARITS (A Raisin...). While ARITS covered many issues expierenced by any and all families, TKAM was perfect. It was just a magnificent example of american literature. I'm only 13, but I don't think there is any book even comparable to TKAM except this one. It's defineately worth your time, yet, if you haven't already read it, To kill a mockingbird, by Harper Lee is brilliant."
3,No bad,Nice book.. kind of boring... Need it for class! It was not that intersting.. The online Movie is much better
3,"Review of ""A Raisin in the Sun""","Hansberry's ""A Raisin in the Sun"" is a social realism drama depicting the inter-family and social struggles of an African American family living in Chicago during the early Civil Rights movement. It follows the life of Walter Younger, his family, and his mother who is forced to make a decision about what to do with the $10,000 she inherited from her late husband--a decision that will dramatically effect the lives of the entire family."
1,Worst book ever !,"The play ""A Raisin in the Sun"" was a very boring book. There wasn't anything interesting about it. It was about a struggling black family that lost all the money they had. Chances are you won't be able to relate to anything in this book. The book ended before it even started."
4,for the ones who like to read,"It was about an African-American family. The father died and left a hanesome amount of money. The oldest son was trusted with the money, but hr tries to do something that he thought was good for the family, and gives the money to his friend to buy a liquor store. The liquor store never came. So they struggle with no money."
4,A Raisin in the Sun: A great work of literature,"A Raisin in the Sun is a great book/play. Lorraine Hansbury does a superb job of mixing drama with real life. The many symbolisms and lessons shown in the script are meaningful and interesting. I especially like the contrasts show between Benethea and Mama. All in all, a book that you should read"
4,A Raisin in the Sun,I purchased this audio tape for my daughter for a summer reading assignment for school. It was easy to listen to and follow. We listened to it in the car each time we had to go somewhere. It kept our interest and was a great way to complete the assignment. I wish more book were available on audio.
5,A Raisin in the sun,"This book was very interesting. It got all my focus . It was very good .I finished the book in three days. The author clearly shows that family love is more valuable than money. The book was also about an African American family going through some things and still sticking together. The family had to deal with hate, violence, and racism."
3,An OK book,"People were telling me how good this book was and after reading it I didn't find it that great. Some parts were humorous but bore me at times. Easy reading though, if that's what you like."
2,This book is dragged out as well as being somewhat boring.,"Plot twists are normally a very important piece of a book, however, this one has a very subtle one. As well as the climax of the book that has them in a conflict with a white fellow who lives in the neighborhood they wish to move to. Wow, riveting stuff here! Do yourself a favor and find something else."
2,Ho Hum Book - Good Play,"I found this a pretty boring book to read. Not particularly well written, but the overall story isn't bad. I really would recommend that you don't buy this book (get it from the library if you have to), but instead watch the dvd/video of the play (Danny Glover is hilarious in the lead role)."
5,Amazing Play,"This a wonderful story about The Younger family who lives in the 1960's Chicago area. It gives us a glimpse of the discrimination the family faced, as well as, a look into family dynamics. It is a great story of love, hope, and family."
4,Good book - better play,It is a nice book. The characters personalities made the book good. If the characters were changed the book wouldn't be as good. The story shows the life of a black family in Chicago and their struggles through the years they lived there.
3,At least the knife works,"I bought this set for my husband at Christmas time. The knife is amazing and sharp! However, the gerber clutch broke by the 2nd day...he was simply using it on plastic! It's a shame, but at least the knife works..."
2,Nice,little smaller than what i expected but nice combo.Action on the EVO Jr. isn't as smooth as i'd like it to be but it's great as a small carry-around.Clutch multi-tool is well-made and great for most basic tasks. Just be careful when closing it.Package deal is perfect for most day to day needs.*update* the clutch broke after only a few uses. knife still going on strong though the edge didn't stay sharp for long.
2,Gerber 22-41544 EVO Jr. & Clutch,"The Knife is a nice little pocket knife size clip knife.The multi-tool is much smaller than it appears on line. The tools are difficult to open and there are no instructions to help. Overall, I was quite disappointed in this product.Adding to my lack of positive feelings for these products is the fact that while they bear the Gerber name, they were both made in China.I'd really like to see online merchants telling us were their products are made."
4,Good for the money,"I purchased this product a couple weeks back. For the money it is a good buy considering you are getting a knife and multitool for close to the price of a multitool alone. The one-handed opening action on the knife was a bit sticky to start, but works well after a bit of practice. I found the knife to be fairly dull out of the box, but nothing a good sharpener won't fix. I also like the locking mechanism on the knife from a safety standpoint, but you better not be a fingernail biter if you ever plan to get it closed again since it takes a strong fingernail to push down on the release mechanism. The pliers on the multitool are excellent and spring loaded to stay in the open position when at rest. Again, I found the other tools on the Clutch a bit difficult to pull out without a good fingernail. Luckily I am not a ""nervous"" person so I did okay, but be warned if you are. Overall I am satisfied with the product and performance. The compact size of both is very nice."
2,Nice but tiny,"While the quality is very good both the tool and the knife are quite small, more toy like than useful. If I had seen them with something to provide some scale, I probably would not have ordered."
4,"NEAT SET, VERY HANDY","I found them to be well made and efficient in use. THe bullt in philips screw driver is a little weak. The knife is very good. Plan on honing the edge of the knife. I like a very sharp knife. The plier caan be used by both large and small hands. Overall on a key chain or in ones pocket, this is a great product. I liked them so much I gave these away as gifts."
4,Gerber 22-42544 EVO Jr.,"This product hit the sweet spot for those individuals to whom I sent one of these for Christmas. All liked it and some said they used it immediately, to help open the kids' gifts."
4,great product for the price,"I honestly didn't expect much from this set since i was getting it for only $20 dollars or so when it was on sale, but it proved to be a very useful little tool. I carry it on me all the time and it comes in handy quite a bit, very good quality as well. Great buy :)"
4,"Knife rocks, multitool is ok...","This combo is good, but not great. The knife is excellent... very sharp (typical Gerber), perfect size for carrying around in a pocket or leaving in a glove-box, and the one handed opening-closing makes it incredibly functional for those occasions when you don't want to put down or release tension on whatever needs cutting. The multi-tool is ok, it has a decent solid feel, but it's really too small for most of the things i might have used it for. It goes in the wife's glove compartment now, just in case."
3,just ok,"the quality is very good on this set, but the knife is a bit to small, i was happy with the size at first, but makes is hard to open with just one hand, the multitool is very thight, its hard to open the tools, it makes to a cute key chain thought. but i guess you cant beat the price."
3,Some design flaws,"Both items are solidly built. The knife, though, has two design flaws: the blade has a small thumb stud, ostensibly for one-hand opening of the blade. Unfortunately, it's so small and close to the handle that it's impossible to get a grip on it (especially for a lefty like me, where the belt clip makes it even harder). This issue isn't critical, as there's an alternative, a small projection on the back of the blade that can be used to flick out the blade quickly, with a teeny bit of practice.The bigger flaw for me is that the opening at the end of the belt clip is too narrow to easily clip over the edge of a pants pocket without using another finger to spread the clip open. Repocketing the knife, then, is less smooth and natural than with other knives I've had."
4,Kiri at her best,"This album of arias contains some expected and some unexpected delights. In addition to the sumptuous ""Depuis le jour"" which is a favourite vehicle for lyric sopranos, Kiri does a very respectabe interpretation of ""D'amour l'ardante flame"" from Berlioz ""légende dramatique""La Damnation de Faust which was composed for the mezzo-soprano voice thanks to the exceptionally beautiful middle range of her voice. Another of my favorites in the collection is her interpretation of an aria from Verdi's Don carlo which is usually heard in Italian translation but work a lot better here in the original French.This is a classic recording and should not be overlooked by Kiri fans or any fans of French opera."
1,Garbage,I bought this for my house while deployed in Iraq so my girlfriend could use it. I come home and find out that it has a well known factory defect that simply shuts the machine off when you try to turn it on. The customer service agent told me that I have to pay to get it fixed because I cannot find the receipt. THEY SOLD ME A BROKEN UNIT AND REFUSE TO FIX IT!Stay away from JVC.
2,Where's bass?,"I am very disappointed in the quality of sound reproduction, in general. Although the sound from a DVD is more full, the natural TV sound is lacking in bass and rich tones. I've found that static noise is annoying, and although I've had to rearrange the method of connecting the speakers to the receiver, the static remains.If I had to do it over again, I would spend the extra money and NOT buy Home Theater in a Box, but separate components."
2,Stopped working in less that a year,My head unit just crashed for some unknown reason. No power at all. I even replaced the fuse which didn't work. And by the way the ceramic fuse used by JVC can't be found any where. I used a glass fuse. Guess I have to go buy some new system.
3,Disappointed for two reasons,"I just bought this unit, thinking that I could connect my DirecTV HR20 DVR to it, but quickly found out I was wrong about that. What this means is, you only use this unit to play the audio from your CATV or DVR receiver (use the audio optical fiber link to make this connection).My next disappointment was the sudden realization that there is no audio output, if you can believe that. This means I can't send audio to my wireless headphone base unit. This is a serious problem for me, as I use headphones on and off throughout the day. Yes, there's a headphones jack on the front panel, but if you plug a jack into it, it cuts off sound through the speakers.I'm very sorry I bought this unit, but I still give it three stars because it's good at what it does. I only wish I would have chosen more wisely (i.e. paid more) to get a more versatile receiver."
5,Good Condition,One of the basis for reading is to read a book in good condition.Thanks to all those who sell and share their books.
5,"This is one of the ""Best Books""","This is the only book I have ever read, besides the scriptures themselves, which has generated within my life a profound spiritual experience which just keeps on living and giving, and increasing joy in my life and in the lives off all those that I am able to influence. This is not a light read. This a spiritual journey which requires effort on many levels. You will want to read this book many times, as I have done. You will want to share it with all of your friends and loved ones, as I have done. Get this book! Read it! Internalize it! Make it happen! I promise you that you will not be disappointed. Partake of the Living Waters and the fruit of the Tree of Life today!"
5,Following the Light Of Christ Into His Presence,Excellent book about how to use the Holy Spirit in our daily lives. Very practical. I highlighted almost the whole book! Love it!
5,Great technical book for train enthusiasts,"My brother asked if I could find this book for him as a Christmas gift. He has a friend who owns an old, very worn copy of ""Rights of Trains"", and had heard a rumor that new copies were available as a reprint. I was very pleased to find a brand new copy of this book, which is a difinitive, authorative, conprehensive collection of train regulations. The book was in perfect condition, wrapped in plastic, was shipped very quickly, and was packaged with a thin catalog which listed other good train books. I am one hundred percent satisfied with the condition and shipment of this book, and my brother is one hundred percent pleased with the contents."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read,"This is my favorite book of all! I'm a voracious reader of many different genres. A House of Her Own touched me in so many ways. First, it is an entertaining and interesting story. Second, it spans a long period in our nation's history in such detail that you feel you've been there. It is a story of women's relationships through periods of history when we modern women might have thought they didn't exist. There is enough coincidence or interaction or whatever to make it a truly magical story.I love giving this to close friends as a gift but it's out of print and hard to find!"
2,Not stoked on Stokes,"Disappointing. I was expecting an Audubon-style reference book, but got a simpler, very brief, nothing new, thin, magazine-sized tickler. I've heard good things about Stokes, but this book wasn't a winner. Was looking for more details about plantlife, positioning of shrubs, feeders, bird baths, landscaping etc, but book consisted more of bios on birds with a little bird-feeding info. at the beginning of the book. Save your money and go elsewhere. :-("
4,new hobby,well written book very informative photos are really breathtakingalso moderately priced have recommended to friends to help them enjoy the birds
3,Bird Feeder Book,"Not a bad book, full of great photos and some nice ideals on what to prepare your feather friends. A simple to understand book."
5,ADDITIONAL FUN FROM A BIRD FEEDER,I HAVE A BIRD FEEDER OUTSIDE MY OFFICE WINDOW-THIS BOOK IS EASY AND ADDS TO THE NATURAL INTEREST OF THE ACTIVITY OUT THERE- IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SERIOUS FOR THE BIRDS__LIFE AND DEATH_AND THEY HAVE A SOCIAL ORDER__BUT IT ALL SEEMS TO WORK AND THIS BOOK HELPS TO DEEPEN THE OBSERVATION
3,Early Wanderly,"This is one of Wanderley's earliest recordings. Quite possibly his first album. It is a far cry from the great albums he would later be making for Verve. This is nice Wanderley, but far from essential. Curiously, the album as a whole doesn't focus too much on his organ. It is more of an orchestral latin jazz band. He gives a lot of room for his band members to solo. He doesn't have much solo spots as compared to his band members. He clearly wrote all the arrangements though. The band is still a work in progress at this point. His other early album for EMI, now on cd, Samba No Esquema, is a much better album and his band is much more refined by 1963. This recording from 1961 allows the listener to hear how he would progress in just a few years. Not essential, but enjoyable notheless. The remastering is good too!"
5,Excellent Mystery,"When I received my copy of this book in the mail, I immediately sat down and read the first 100 pages without pause! As both a musician and a fan of mystery novels, the story appealed to me on both fronts. Well-studied musicians will find themselves enjoying the musicological aspect of the main character's dissertation quest, but never does Seitz wander into a realm that non-musicians cannot follow or appreciate. The pacing throughout the story is particularly excellent, and kept me wondering ""whodunit"" right up until the end. I highly recommend this book to lovers of music, musicians, and mystery fans -- I am looking foward to the sequel!"
1,"Oh, Please Don't Waste Your Money!","My husband and I are in our fifties and trying to decide whether to rent in a nicer neighborhood during retirement or buy our own place (which would take us to another part of the Los Angeles area). Unable to find suggestions in books on ""senior"" living, I paid for and downloaded this two-page tripe. It gives old, outdated statistics about how many people rent and how many buy. That's about it. Simple and useless information I could have found elsewhere on the internet. Free."
3,Not bad...,I love the feel of this shoe but even in 7.5 it's a little snug. I might go back to Reebok.
4,Lauritz Melchior,One of my favorite sets featuring the greatest Heldentenor that ever lived. It is amazing how you can observe the full power of this magnificent tenor as he hits his stride and holds that supreme position at the top of the Wagnerian heights.
5,a hidden classic,"Von Stade is in very fine voice on this CD, and her rendition of ""My Funny Valentine"" is one of the best ever, with a rich, expressive delivery. Her voice has sometimes been considered too operatic for pop material but on this she's just right. Other standouts are ""Moon Of My Delight"" and the playful ""To Keep My Love Alive"" but the whole album is solid."
2,Not a gem,"The gorgeous classical voice of Frederica unfortunately does not serve the comedy songs of Rogers & Hart. Her delivery is that of an opera star, so the brilliant wit of a song like 'To keep My Love Alive' is overdone and falls flat. This material is in need of a musical comedy performer. Frederica Von Stade is not that kind of performer."
1,mirrior,it took over a week past the due date to get this package to me . then i was told that because of my last review that i would be reinbrusted for the shipping in handeling charges but never received the reinbrustment .
3,Kinda disappointed,"""You get what you pay for.""Connector fits very well.Mirror glass quality is very cheap.Part does fit but the corners on the body of the mirror will NOT be flush with the pillar.Air noise will NOT be insulated when driving at high speeds (such as the freeway)If you find yourself needing one of these parts for your Camry... you're better off paying the extra cash at the dealership for quality parts."
5,Few shows are this good!,"Im not a chick but I do enjoy ""drama"", when it's done right, and I absolutely love sci-fi. Real sci-fi not that mystical magic crap that makes up 99% of everything that comes on the SyFy channel. This show does have a bit of a slow start but it is worth the wait. Season 2 is even better. Other than Stargate: Universe ""V"" is the top show on tv!"
5,Kodiak,i was extremely happy with this product. it was exactly what i expected. i can't wait till season 2 hits DVD so i can get that.
4,As above so below,Imagine Earth is dying and the survivors decide to leave Earth in search of another habitable planet. They discover a planet similar to earth with primitive humanoids at the top of the food chain. The natives are in awe of the earthlings and their technology and the earth visitors' temptation to utilize their admiration to colonize their world for their own purposes is irresistible. Some of them discover earth beings are not gods but instead a race that destroyed its planet through misuse and abuse thus their arrival here. They are told by morally conscious earthlings that the intention is to rob their world of its resources and enslave them. They organize with the help of these radical earthlings to rid themselves of the visitors ...
5,Better Than the Original,"I watched the original ""V"" series when it came out and it was good...back then. The episode where the V human hybrid twins were born had everyone tuned in.This new ""V"" series is better. It's grittier with good plot twists and much better special effects. The original ""V"" looks cheesy in comparison.In the original series, Jane Badler was excellent as the V leader, Diana, marching around in her tight fighting catsuit and eating human males she would pick up hitchhiking. The original show is worth watching for the moments Badler is on screen. Her snappy line delivery and mouse munching are priceless."
2,Just Goofy,"I was very intrigued by the previews for this show and the first half or so of this pilot was just as intriguing. But unfortunately the plot took a turn for the worst as it transitioned from intelligent to goofy. I was surprised at the ending, simply because I couldn't conceive it being contrived. At least they had the decency to make the big reveal in the first episode instead of stringing us along for an entire season or more. Now at least I know not to watch any more. You may not consider the ending of this episode a ""big reveal,"" but it would have been, had they declined to reveal it until later. Instead they leave the audience with no mystery, just a go-getter speech. I can't say I'm interested in watching episode two. I'm not interested in the plot anymore, I'm not interested in the characters and I certainly have no expectation that the writers will pull through and create an intelligent and engaging show after this episode. Maybe they will, but I don't expect it."
1,No closed captioning. Why????,There are millions of hearing impared people in the US. It's time to realize this.We can't enjoy the show without CC.Agoston
1,Horrible,This is a horrible show. I am angry that ABC chose this piece of garbage over flash foward. This show will be a failure in the fall for the network. I bet on it.
4,Rating is have having it..,I don't like when the site insist to do more than just rate the items by stars.When I Have to type something I lower the star rating. If I would want to say something then I would.
2,Poor writing causes the show to drag,"As a household of sci-fi fans, we tried several times to get into this show. but it is incredibly boring, despite the potential. Nothing ever seems to happen. There's no suspense, no surprise, no twists, nothing scratches the surface. Their attempts at plot twists are ho-hum, and I've never once found myself thinking ""I wonder what will happen next?"" because I know that every time I tune in, three things will be true: 1) The Visitors are evil (blatantly so; no shades of gray here), 2) They're trying to lull humanity into a false sense of security, and 3) There is a resistance. Everything else just feels like it was thrown in to have something happen, but it really doesn't have any relevance to what's going on.The acting is pretty good but you really can't connect with any of the characters. There's nothing there to relate to, nothing to grab you and suck you in."
4,V for V the series,This is a very good remake of the original series with a lot more action and more storytelling than the original.
5,Great Series!,"I didn't know what to expect when I watched the first episode of V, but I ended liking it so much. Now it has become my second favorite show to Lost. The show has talented actors, interesting story, and great special effects. The show was on for four episodes until it took a long break, then came back even better than before. The show is fast paced with so many twists and turns, you don't know what to expect. Definitely buy V: The Complete First Season, you will not be disappointed. I hope it gets picked up for a second season."
2,Simply a poorly written story.,"The story of V does not adapt well. The dialogue is at parts very boring. The teenage love interest is very, well dry and stereotypical of a teenage drama. The teenage drama often detracts from the main story line. It tries to create a 24 sense of urgency at times, but fails. I could explain more, but bottom line there are far better choices out there. Season two barely made it from being canceled. Do not expect a third season."
3,no suprises,"Pretty much along the lines of most SciFi shows. You can see that this will generate a new cadre of fans. The same fans that watch Battlestar Galactica, Lost and Star Trek. It's going to be good for awhile and then the episodes will become pablum for the masses. Gotta say, Michelle Baccrain is HOT. That's about all that is hot. Three seasons from now it will move to another cable network and be all but forgotten, except for those SciFi fans."
5,An insightful look into the dark world of girl gangs.,8 Ball Chicks is one of the best books I have read in a long time on the subject of girl gangs. I am a residential child care worker at New England Kurn Hattin Homes in Westminster VT. Many of our children hail from the inner cities and many are affiliated with a gang in some way- including the girls. It is refreshing to finally see authors recognizing the dynamics that girl gangs have on our society.
5,Tears till the end,"This book is an incredible journey into the lives of gang girls, not just as ruthless fighters, but vulnerable young girls and childhood lost. I cried and felt my heart break reading this book."
3,I was hoping this book would be more than it was,"Author had some good insights but the dialog attributed to these people often just didn't ring true. Sikes also managed to inject her liberal bias into the narrative (""Reagan illusion of prosperity"", ""Anita Hill's hazing by Congress"", etc.) which damaged her journalistic ""objectivity"". I was somewhat disappointed with this book - perhaps I will read another gang book for comparison."
5,Bad A** Chicks,This is an Awesome book. It shows how woman are taking control in the gand scene. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning more about the gang scene.
2,Wildly mediocre,"I thought I was going to love this album based on the singles ""Fill Me In"" and ""Seven Days"". Friends in the UK were raving about Craig David, particularly his 2-step track ""Re-Wind"" and I was eagerly awaiting the US release of his album. Little did I know that ""Re-Wind"" is a limpid mess and the rest of the album is padded with lowest-common-denominator fill-in-the-blank faux-soul. Nothing else on the album evokes the passion or bounce of the two lead singles. It's a shame; had the other tracks even been half as good, this would have been a decent album."
2,Born To Do What???,"First of all, this album (sucks...), 2nd of all, he can barely sing, The song ""Fill Me In"" is OK, but all the rest is totally Awful. I was looking forward to this album, because of ""Fill Me In"", and ""7 Days"", But I wasn't looking forward to much...I returned this (horrid) piece o' (...), and got Usher's latest ""8701"" which is great! I reccomend that one fo' sho!!!"
1,Wow! Born to Ruin It!,"WOW! Another One-Hit-Wonder! Craig David has done an amazing job of taking a great song like ""Fill Me In"" and adding on 13 other ""songs"" that don't do anything but pull this album to the floor. The 2-step (UK Garage) styles shown in ""Fill Me In"" are unique, but never repeated, and the rest of the album is merely half sewn-together wanna-be R&B songs.Another annoying thing that you can notice when listening to this album is how in EVERY SINGLE SONG there is a little muffled ""craig david"" just to remind you who made the horrible little ditty that you are wasting your time listening to.I think that this album is a true waste of plastic and paper. had it never been made, i would have saved money, time and the energy that it took me to write this article."
5,One of the best released of 01-02,"This cd is awesome. Some of the best music i have heard in forever in the rnb/pop category. ""Fill Me in"", ""7Days"", and ""Rendevous"" are absolute awesome with it's melodic, fantasy sounds. Good dance tracks included, and a few ballad type songs. LOVE this album!"
5,the best r&b guy!,i think that Craig david is DA BOMB his music is awesome!luv ya babe!#1 music freak
1,HUNH? WHAT?....,"CRAIG DAVID PROVIDES THE MUZAK...DOES [ANYONE] SELL ELEVATORS? ...seriously, though, he carries a good tune but this just doesn't appeal to me. ""soulful""? hardly. BORN TO BORE."
1,Oh dear.,"I'm writing this because - A. I'm bored, and B. I think this guy is so overrated. I saw him do a P.A., and, no doubt, the confidence is there, but, as with Robbie Williams, it takes more than confidence to be real innovater. A celebrity, maybe. But I have no interest in these Dido, Coldplay types. It's theatrics and image, and a clever marketing strategy that make's it happen. Those record sales are what has killed off the music biz and allowed braindead entities, who by rights should stick to being lifeguards or working in suntan shops, to just run around thinkin their the dogs bollocks. This is a sad and meritricious time... Oh, and, who was I talking about... Craig! The only thing that needs filling in is his mouth. Filla would do."
4,"Not the best, but some standout material","When I bought this CD, I didn't know what to expect. I had heard his first single, ""Fill Me In,"" and it had grown on me, so I thought I would check it out. After giving it a full listen, I found myself pleasantly surprised. It was actually pretty good although the low points often outweigh the high points when it comes down to it. Tracks like ""Fill Me In"" and ""7 Days"" are definitely great tracks, but one track had a significant meaning to me that gave this cd a four star rating. That track was ""Walking Away."" I think any person that has ever been fed up with all their relationship problems and cannot find happiness in it no matter what they do should listen to this track. It has some very good advice in the lyrics, just walk away. ""Once In A Lifetime"" was pretty good too, but I skip over it occasionally. The rest of the album is forgettable to me, but what is good on this album makes it worth the price."
4,A Very Pleasant Surprise,"I'm a middle-aged white guy, so I'm not exactly the target demographic for R&B; music, but I took a shot with this only because I'd heard Craig David's name so much. What a pleasant surprise.He's smooth, articulate, and the music (close enough to soft jazz to appeal to me) is outstanding -- a treat to the ears. My horizons have been expanded."
5,Great Debut! ..Sure to be a HIT!,"Back about 6 months ago when I heard about Craig David I was all ""Humm another guy trying to make it big in the US."" But then one day I downloaded a song off Napster of his. And from then on he became a favorite of mine! All my friends know that I LOVE CRAIG, I'm a guy and I'm so into him and his music!""Fill Me In"" - Great first single, I LOVE THIS VIDEO! I cant get enough of it. This song is hot! And they way his voice sounds and flows together is great!""Walking Away"" - A Ballad from Craig, and its Sad because hes walking away from someone he loves, but the lyrics and his voice sounds great!""You Know What!"" I LOVE THIS SONG , its great!You have to get this cd, its great to bump in your car! Craig is great, does he pluck his everybows .. I wish I had his eyebrows! Hes perfect in every way .. he was sure BORN TO DO IT!"
4,A Rare Talent,"Craig David's debut album, ""Born to do it."" A smash in the UK, much potential to be a smash here in the states as well. Tracks like ""Key to my Heart"", ""Walking Away"" and ""Rendevous"" make this CD a must-buy. Not to mention the two singles, ""7 days"" and ""Fill me In."" Craig David is a rare talent, and look for great things from him in the future."
3,Not exaclty my style but worth a peek,"Allright R&B is not my style and although he throws in some dj spins here and there and adds some elements of a pseudo hip-hop I would still argue this R&B. However as childish as some of his material can be parents getting upset because their daughter is out at night with a rebel-Craig David ""fill me in"" his tunes are very catchy and admittedly I find my self groovin to the beats this is definitely not a five star cd but it is worth checking out and is also a great cd to make love to, Hopefully as David emerges he will find more style and his songs will stop taking on the sounds of all of the rest of the songs on his album like I said R&B isn't my thing but honestly this is worth a peek. Peace."
4,One Track Mind,"Definitely a CD by a teenage boy. All the songs are about the same subject (smile). But if you forget about his one track mind and listen to the smooth beats and melodies, you will get hooked on almost all the songs.It is a very good CD. He has a different kind of sound. I think he may be around for a while, because as he matures so will his lyrics. And once you put some serious lyrics with his mellow sound you will have another Luther or Peabo. Highly recommend this CD."
5,Can't be messin' around!!,"When i first heard of Craig David, i thought.....another R&B wannabe! I'm not always right!! This guy rules..... his amazing cd ""Born To Do It""..... is on my number 1 spot right now! Each song you listen to, has a different feel. His variaty of styles is unique, and i must say not everyone has a talent like his! It is definetly a 'MUST HAVE' cd!! Can't be messing around with that!"
4,Watch out for him!,"Craig David will surely make it big! ""Fill Me In"" and ""Rewind"" are getting lots of airplay here in Manila. These are just two of his songs, and he is already one of the most requested artists!His music has a unique twist, in his rapping and the way he delivers his songs.I think he will be the male version of Madonna, in terms of popularity and variety of songs."
1,not good,"Completely dissatisfied! First the case was cracked in three different places. Second the disc was dirty, and the cd only played the first three songs. The rest would either skip or wouldnt play!"
2,LACKING!,"There are so many words I can use to describe this cd but the main word I will stick to Is lacking.I had hoped this was going to be the bomb but it is seriously lacking originality.There are a few tracks of note but not enough to keep me Interested.I hope on his next effort,he will branch out and let his true talent shine."
4,His voice makes me melt!,"I really like this album, and I'd see him in concert. I'm an R&B fan and this is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. That being said, Craig David does have the habit of saying his name at the beginning of his tracks. It's very annoying and takes a star off an otherwise awesome debut.""Fill Me In"" and ""Rendezvous"" are great tracks. If you like those, you'll like the rest of the album."
3,Not so bad,"I have no idea where I got this CD, but it came up in my iTunes random play and prompted me to dig out the whole album and listen to it. It's nothing awesome true enough, but I like the energy and the music reminds me a lot of the Von Bondies. Rock and Roll."
2,Less than I had hoped for.....,"... Well I should have waited a little bit longer because the CD is to say the least .... a dissapointment. I have been listening to it the entire day trying to sell myself on it but... nothing. The whole album sounds...watered down. No other song manages to capture the energy of ""Like I love you""... The album does have a few highlights, very few...Only die hard fans should bother getting or...buying it....D.L in Florida"
2,dull dull dull dull,completely overrated I dont get what the fuss is about - 1.5 good songs and they get played out real fast!!!
1,Weird,"This guy sings girl songs! Cry Me a River is a song that a Diva sings, not a guy. He nneds to quit his solo singing career and go back to N'Sync, not that there much better either. My cousin has this CD and I listened to the whole thing. I wasted like an hour of my life. Weird songs, wierd album, wierd guy."
4,fantastic cd,"This cd is awesome. I couldn't stand the majority of NSync's songs, so this album really surprised me. It's just great, fun pop/R&B, and a lot is reminiscent of old school MJ and Stevie Wonder. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because some of the tracks aren't that great, but the good far outweighs the fluff. Keep an open mind...this really is a terrific album."
3,not bad but not the best either,"some of the songwriting is downright corny lyrically but sevral of the songs were well done by the neptunes and timbaland, they made this CD more than justin. Cry Me a River is a great song and the janet duet(which is what made me buy the CD) was great, too bad he spoiled her reputation he's a punk for that. I have never liked justin I just like a couple songs and that's it."
1,Out of Sync,"Justin honey, stay with what you know works N'sync works even though those song were fast wearing, this CD is pitifulk an absoulute disgrace I mean was he beat with the Michael Jackson stick or something? I admire your fellow bandmates at least they know in their heart that their white this music is purely saddening a complete waste of $20"
1,OMG OMG,OMG OMG OMG OMG JUSTUK HE STO HTO OMG OMG OMG I LOKEVVVVV HIM OMG OMG OMG HE SOO RGOL AN I LU HIM AN HE SO GUD A I LU HIS REW ALUM AN OMG OMG OMG HE GI PLAY O MTV AN OMG OMG OMG THA!!! ME HE GUD I ALO LIK REBELIES ROK N RAL LIC DA BUTAL ATLEE IMPON1 AN OMG OMG OMG JUITN HE SO HOT OMG OMG OMG I LU HIM I LU HIM OMG OMG OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Avoid this Blue Oyster Bar patron!,"Triple H(as Your Worst Nightmare): Justin is my hero, I want to jump his bones! Shawn Michaels(as Hellraiser): Justin is my lover. Triple H: Justin has to be the fugliest and most disgusting piece of s**t I have ever heard. Shawn Michaels: This mama's boy only got famous for his looks. Triple H: This guy was a male version of his skanky ex B*tchney! Shawn Michaels: This guy whined Rock Your Body and Cry Me a River! Triple H: I say go drown loser! If you are not down with D-X we got TWO WORDS FOR YA (crowd yells S*CK IT!)"
1,what a putz,"i heard this fruitcake justin was saying how lame and boring virginia beach was. well he's from memphis, tennessee. u can't get much wacker than that. what did he grow up on a farm or something? redneck. sounds lame to me"
1,OMG how could anyone like this....,"Justin Timberlake is the biggest f.a.g. ever, the only people that like this c.r.a.p. some call ""music"", are little 12 year odl teenyboppers that think a 22 year old guy is ""hot"", its soooo patheticHE DOESNT EVEN WRITE HIS OWN SONGS. HE DOESNT EVEN SING LIVE. HE IS A DANCER AND THATS IT."
1,truly amazing,"........how a pathetic whiner like JT can rise to the top of the charts, that is. Another question worth pondering about is whether the reason he broke up with Britney is because he suggested they do it doggystyle and she said no.......or maybe she suggested it and he said no--the latter making more sense.In any case, this guy has absolutely no credibility, I don't care what the Amazon reviewer says, but this guy does not, and very likely never will, make mature music. I don't mind his dancing--which is what he should have stuck to doing all the while, but as a singer, he's a joke.And now's begun hinting at sex........weeeelllll is that JT's attempt to convince me he's a normal hetrosexual? Gimme a break,Timberlake, go back to your song and dance routines."
2,hype,i give him 2 stars cause I really like the diss song for britney. cry me a river. other than that his voice is annoying.
5,I love Justin,Justin I have all your cd's.I wish I can be your girlfriend.I want a autograph from you
4,It's good but some of the lyrics...,"""It's like you're from out of this world, except you're not green"", ""I want to be your mother,... so I can hold you tight""! What the freak! There were some really odd lyrics in more than a few of the songs on this CD. But if you can ignore them then it's a pretty good CD. I think Justin can sing even if he is a wannabe."
1,Not worth 1 penny,"I think his voice is so bad, I cant believe I wasted my money. I thought it woul be a lot better then it was, too bad I cant return it after I open it. I would choose no star if I could."
2,"""I Wanna Be Like Mike""","This cd wasn't all that good to me. Is it me, or is he trying too hard to be Michael Jackson?? There is only one M.J. and they'll never be another. The man is a legend. Justin, you are trying TOO HARD!"
1,doesn't quite cut it,"I'm a big fan of all kinds of r&b, hip hop and pop music and it doesn't matter to me what race or gender the artist is, let me make that straight. But this CD is an awful piece of work. He hooked up with Timbaland and Neptunes who tried to give him urban beats, but the album just sounds outdated, stale and justin's whiny voice and corny songwriting clashes horribly. I've never seen such horrible lyric writing from anyone as I have with justin. Even my 7 year old cousin can write better poetry than this loser. Avoid at all costs."
1,"I am not a fan, nor will I ever be!","he just isn't very good, and he doesn't make very good music. I don't like the sound of it, doesn't appeal to me. Sorry to all of you fans, just my opinion"
3,it's ok,"it's a bit too overrated, but worth it for the tracks produced by timbaland and neptunes. The good songs on this CD are Senorita, Like I Love You, Oh No What You Got, Cry Me a River, Rock Your Body, Last Night, And She Said Take Me Now, but don't expect too much in the songwriting, the words are nothing special, but it's a good CD if you want nice music to groove to"
5,Best Album Ever,"I think that Justin's debut album is exellent. He really let his fans in on his emotions and personal experiences. The songs ""Never Again"" and ""Cry Me A River"" both talk about his break up with Britney Spears. His songs have great meaning and they each have their own unique sound. I definetely recommend Justin Timberlake's solo album to everyone of all ages. I hope you take a chance and spend a little money on Justin's album because it is ABSOLUTELY worth it!!!!!!"
5,AWESOME!,"I love this CD! I got it from my Mom because I saw him sing one of the songs on the music awards. It's lots of fun and he sings really well, even solo!"
1,such a waste,"cry me a river and take me now are the only good songs on this CD, don't waste your money. Spend it on a michael jackson album instead, you won't regret it. No one likes justin or cares for him, people I encounter in the younger crowd like Usher more than Justin, and some appreciate michael jackson too as a musician, Justin is a nobody! And if he was really all that and proved to be a mainstay, why did this CD sell barely 3 million copies and only peaked at #2 on Billboard 200 despite all the hype at the time of the release? If he was really all that, he would have sold much more than N Sync's No Strings Attached which is at 11 million copies, it's so obvious. The only successful solo star from a boyband is michael jackson when he did his solo career, he sold millions and millions with his brothers, but solds millions and millions more than he did with his brothers once he went solo, now THAT is what I call outdoing group members, take a hint!"
2,gets dull after 5 listens,I bought this because my music collection contains very little pop and I quite liked Cry Me A River. Some decent beats that initially hold your interest are not enough to cover up the content which is a guy singing about how much he loves himself. I give this album 2 stars as its a solid enough rip off of MJ and I give myself 1 star for handing over the cash for it and feeding the machine!
3,buy off the wall instead,"this album has it's good moments and a lot of weak moments. Buy michael jackson's off the wall instead, it was that album that inspired justin and the neptunes to make this album, and a hell lot better and soulful. Justified's not bad, but there's more misses than hits on this. The singles that were released, plus the song with janet are the only good songs on here."
2,Suprisingly empty for the caliber of Justin Timberlake,"I was a bit taken back when I listened to this recording. The material on this album is far below Justin's talent. He said in many interviews that he wanted ""to spread his wings"", but this recording is ground-bound. The only potential flight is ""Like I Love You"", which is an innovative hip-hop salsa type record. The rest of the CD falls short of acceptable. This record was rushed in every sense of the word. A sorry fate for a debut solo recording."
1,wow its so amazing!.......yeah right,"hmmmmm....lets all sell our soul to satan because its more coneniant that way. Justin Timberlake is awesome. There is no better way to insult sellouts than comparing them to justin timberlake. Did anyone see him cry on punk'd? What is happening to the state of men these days? Why can't we keep our balls and chest hair like real men? If you are a teeny bop chick and like this, you will grow out of it someday. If you are already grown.....hmmmm...get help! The meterosexual thing is a fad and will pass...you will see"
1,AWFUL! dont waste ur money!,"THIS CD IS AWFUL! PLEASE IF YOU WANT GOOD MUSIC, THEN DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! Just read the other bad reviews this CD got and you'll understand why!"
1,"JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE-----""THE KING"" ?","On the radio a DJ introduced one of Timberlakes songs with the statement ""the Elvis Presley of the 21st century"".I think its a crime against humanity to compare JT to Elvis Presley. Elvis was the most influencial performer in popular music history with a talent and charisma that JT could only dream of.Lets see if JT will top the charts 19 times,sell in excess of 1 BILLION records or still have people listening to him in 50 years.JT doesnt deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as Elvis Presley.Elvis will still be attracting new fans when JT is all but a bad memory."
1,freakin-a,"man, this album is a joke. i can't believe anyone would actually pay money for this worthless album. i would pay somebody to destroy this album rather than buy it. justin timberlake, and pretty much all other pop (aka crap) music needs to disappear. and the people that listen to it. man, these loser teenagers need to find some better music. i'm 17 years old, and i, at least, know good music. none of today's ""artists"" can write any decent lyrics. it's all just a bunch of nonsense wrapped together. so, to sum up, all of today's pop ""musicians"", along w/ all rap artists too, need to pack up and find different jobs. and the people that listen to it need to go listen to some good albums, like dylan, springsteen, or the beatles."
1,"Real music, please?","What has happened to music? When did music start revolving around teenage girl's fantasies? This music is so watered down and sappy that if it were any sappier it'd be coming out of a maple tree. Please do yourself a favor and listen to real pop artists with talent. Go buy a Beach Boys album, go get ""Off the Wall"" or ""Thriller"", go get a Jewel album, anything but this commericalized drivel. Their is a reason as to why Justin Timberlake got booed mercilessly off the stage in Toronto. This music is the reason.Final Verdict: Avoid at all costs."
5,The best i have ever heard!!,"This is the best album i have ever heard from a solo-artist who has tried to go in a different direction from *nsync. I especially like ""Like I Love You"", ""Cry Me A River"", ""Still On My Brain"" and ""Rock Your Body"". I think this boy has real talent and i cant wait to see him live as i have seen some brilliant performances on British television."
2,Not Justine to Me!!,This album is not what I expected...in a strange way all the songs seem to relate to Britney...and who cares about there relationship....Justin is so talented and I just expected so much more from him...I must say I am hurt by the outcome of this album.
3,nice solo debut,I was amazed when I heard this album. It is very very good! JT is an excellent writer and I love that he is putting his emotions into his songs. Very Very good!
1,Don't waste your money just because you like N'Sync,"I am a fan of N'Sync so I thought that I would like this CD, especially when several people compared it to the older stuff by Michael Jackson. WRONG!!! There is one song on the CD that is good but the rest is trash. I don't know where he went wrong with all of the help he had but he should just stick to N'Sync. He has a nice voice but this doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money buying this unless it is a used one and you spend next to nothing, or better yet just buy his single."
4,It grew on me!,"First of all, be it known that I am a grown woman, so my appeal to Justin Timberlake is not the Boy Band Frenzy of some of the younger generation. However, I absolutely loved ""Justified"", had it been an old LP album I would have worn the grooves off of it. I anxiously awaited the release of his new CD, but I am just a little disappointed. I can't really explain why... it is not that I don't like (I kinda' think I do) but it just is not what I expected. It has a ""Justin meets Prince"" feel that is going to take a little getting use to. All in all, it was worth the money and I am glad I purchased it."
4,Til he went out like a PUNK!,"This album is dope except for a few tracks where his voice just isn't hittin tha right spots. I wish people would stop tryin 2 compare it 2 N'Sync, b/c it's not, it's Justin. It's a pretty laid back album with a few upbeat tracks. My faves r 'Like I Love You', 'Cry Me A River', 'Still On My Brain', & 'Right For Me'.Even though I think the album is clean, I lost all respect for dude when he went out like a punk and let Janet take all the heat at the superbowl. Malfunction my a**! If u weren't and still aren't a fan of N'Sync but you're a fan of good R&B;, cop dis!"
4,Good Start,"As with many people, I was somewhat unsure just how Justin would sound without 4 other people in the background to offer the tempered musical balance that I have grown used to from NSYNC. Worry not, Justin pulls it off. The breathy tenor's voice mixes beautifully with the funky beats that both the Neptunes and Timbaland throw at you on this album. On Justified, Timberlake doesn't stray far from his pop roots, as each song deals with his ordeals with the opposite sex. Those it is noteworthy to mention that the sound he delivers has been altered. The ""in your face"" poppiness found on every NSYNC album has been taken down a few notches on this album, leaving a subtler R&B melody, which is sure to be tolerated, if not accepted, by audiences of all ages and races. Justified has its flaws, but its triumphs outshine them. Check this cd out with an open mind and look forward to being impressed."
3,pretty okay,"So I just got the album, it's pretty good. JTR, has a really smooth, mello voice that flows well. Definitly get if your a Justin fan."
5,"Justin Timberlake's ""Justified""","Justin's voice is so smooth and amazing. This album really lets him express his true talents and feelings away from the Nsync craze. You can dance, groove or just kick back with this one! Justin is one of the most talented young artist of his time, plus he writes his own songs and it's original. This album is a MUST buy!You go MEMPHIS BABY!!!"
1,Mmm...,"Worth pondering for a second, is Justin Timberlake a great singer and performer. Mmmm... I Wonder... NO. No, he is a rip-off, albeit a good one, good enough for people to buy his CD. He is a complete copy of Michael Jackson. But Michael Jackson wrote and performed good music. Justin Timberlake could never come up with classics such as Billy Jean or Thriller, he comes up with stereotypical pop music like everyone else. There's nothing special about this guy, he can't sing, Cry Me A River has some horrible, whiny vocals and occasinonally in some songs he tries to beat box, what a fool! Sure he can dance, but thats the end to his talents. Maybe he'd be better as a dancer in theatre somewhere, but just please not on my TV! Sorry Justin, you're 'good looks' and 'personality' don't fool me, go off and dance somehwere, have I justified my opinion?"
1,A Disappointment,"First off let me say that I have been counting down the days until Justified came out. I'm a huge fan of NSYNC and Justin as well, and was looking forward to hearing what he could do on his own. ""Like I Love You"" had my hopes up, but when I listened to the CD I was very disappointed, to say the least ... It was all I could do to get through the whole CD, and my recommendation is to listen to some samples before you buy this CD. I should have..."
1,"""Never Again"" am I gonna listen to this CD!","Justin used to be my favorite singer (what a surprise!) in the summer of '04, and my friend loved him, too. Until the Superbowl, with the one and only Janet Jackson (yay...) and the whole 'malfunction', and then we relaized he has issues. Some of his songs I can listen to, but they annoy me so bad. So, one day me and my friend went outside with a pair of goggles and smashed the CD...how good it felt. So, for the safety of your ears, do not buy this CD."
3,"Justin ""MJ"" Timberlake","Justin Timberlake must have been listening to some serious Michael Jackson when he was working on this album. Many of the songs such as ""Like I Love You"" and ""Cry Me A River"" almost sound like they were originally written for Jackson (were they rejects from ""Invincible""?)....and if you like Justin's solo material and don't like Michael's music you are in serious MJ denial.Overall, this is a great album, especially if you have an appreciation for classic Pop/R&B with a big helping of MJ and a hint of Missy Elliott.By the way, if you are expecting a ""duet"" with Janet Jackson, you will be sadly disappointed. Janet's contribution to this album is nothing more than a few whispers at the beginning of a song."
3,Aight...,"This album is ok. But it is is sooooo far from his pop *N'SYNC roots. Justin hits a more mature vibe with this one, and it is defintly not ""Tearin Up My Heart."" Cry Me A River Is My Favorite song of All-Time. You Go Justin!!!!!! But all the other songs suck. Senorita is ok 2,3,5,& and 6 is da bomb. And 4 is acceptable. I aint hatin, I'm just sayin i don't particulary like the rest of the cd."
3,Celebrity pt. II,"If you have a tolerance for high pitched girly singing then this might be the album for you. Otherwise, you'd be hard pressed to find any track that sounds like a guy sang it.Set aside the squeaky girls voice, you've got some seriously similar sounding tracks that scream the unoriginal, pitterpatter of N.E.R.D. ""Senorita"", ""Like I Love You"", ""What You Got, (Oh No)"", ""Rock Your Body"", ""Nothin' Else"", ""Last Night"", and ""Take Me Now"" all sound like one endless track. ""Cry Me a River"" is truly the outstanding track (sounds a hundred times better and creepier live). Mr. Timberlake's ballads are simply boring, sticky, and stupid. This album fails to break any interesting ground so it's quite amazing he got as great press as he has. But a bunch of similar sounding tracks and saccharine ballads aren't enough to make this album nearly as great as its hype."
1,h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e c-r-a-p,this guy just cant sing at all .i wonder on what category did this nerd get his grammy award. this album is full of deplorable and cheesy pop songs.avoid this crap like the plague.
1,HWANG!,"Oh, my gosh. That one kid is such a Kogeko. And omg, these people are crazy. For one thing with artists like Cyndi Lauper, Naomi Tamura, and The Corrs out there. That don't even get recognized for their great talents. It's pretty sad that this loser gets a CD. He's just an annoying little boy who thinks he's funny when he's not. ""Don't be scurred!"" what the hell is that? WHAT A LOSER. Btw, I think that George Gotfryd should come out with a new CD, he's the best!!!! GO GOLDEN GIRLS FOREVER!!!! PIMPLES. FABRICS, FABRICS, AND MORE FABRICS."
1,This dude is gay!,"Did I just mention that this wannabe is gay.Oh I think I did.All he can do is try to sing,Dance and grab his nuts like Michael Jackson.Nothing new here just old style pop/Rnb crap.I beg u please make good use of your money.Give it to charity I don't care what u do with it just please avoid this album.It's a pity I had to give it at least one star."
3,jUSTIN jUST iN tIME,"Awesome Really Good, Great songs of different situations andfeelings. Sung with with great emotion and enthusiam. It's allgood but I don't exactly like it when he goes high .He soundslike a GIRL. No OFFENCE to him. His fine"
5,Justified is pure sucess!,"Being a huge music junky, I love listening to new artists.Justin Timberlake isn't exactly a new artist, but listening to his first solo album, ""Justified"", really made me look at him differently. It's not your typical ""poppish"" album, It maybe shouldn't even be catigorized as a pop album because It's an amazing mix of R&B;, and soulful vocals that come together to make one of the best albums this year. Justin gets a little help from artists such as Timbaland, The Neptunes and Brian Mcnight and more.With tracks like ""cry me a river"" (which is my favorite!)and the first single ""like I love you"" and other tracks on the album, the album is sure to shoot up the charts. Justified also gives a little""sumthin,sumthin"" to the Britney Spears break-up. But aside from that the album is genius. Anyone who doesn't but this album will miss out on a great music experience!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"This was the best CD ever!!!, it has great songs and great vocals, and there all sung by the best singer in the world..... JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE!!!! I would recomend it to any who either loves Justin or just wants a CD to listen to when hangin or chillen or even doin work. I absolutely adored it!!!"
1,Total crap,"All I have to say is that Justin Timberlake has to die. His singing sucks, the beats are overused and annoying, and he's just a self-centered muthaf***er. He needs to get N-Sync back so they can all be in the same place when I bomb it. Do not waste your money on this pop crap."
1,"What the hell is this, somebody throw a pie","Justin Timberlake is one of the least talented performers of all-time. He became famous for being a singer in a boy band, for those of you don't know boy bands put 5 singers in a band because maybe one of them could sing. Then some idiot gave him a solo contract so idiots can buy this CD, then the people who buy this album will regret it in a few years.Quoting the worlds smartest insult comic dog Triumph ""Does he rap, does he sing, he doesn't know what to suck at."""
1,Really Bad!!,"Based on all the hype and awards this album received, you would think its a masterpiece, but it's in fact complete and total CRAP!! I've never heard such a bad pop album in my life, it's truly awful to listen to! The only half-decent song is Cry me a River, but even that song is just a lame attempt at publicity at someone else's expense. It was produced for pure shock value, which makes me sick! As for the rest of the album, literally 99.9% of it is crap filler and not even worth a second listen! I'm amazed at how hyped this album has become because it's truly not worth any kind of recognition! Bypass this atrocity at all costs!!"
1,Forget the hype!,"This album just plan sucks! It's such a shame that there was so much hype around Justin at the time that his and Nick Carter's albumNow or Nevercame out that Nick's album didn't sell as well as his. And Nick's album is 10x better! I still listen to it and it came out years ago! Justin is some hip-hop artist wanna be! Nick was true to himelf by doing a combo of rock and pop. People, if you want to hear a better album get Nick's!"
3,Solo,Often when band members go solo they don't keep there fame and they become forgotten but Justin proved that you could go solo and still make it big. He has a great voice so I think his solo carear will go far if he keeps it going.
3,Exactly What You'd Expect,"Justin Timberlake is more talented than alot of people will give him credit for, but sadly he doesn't prove those people wrong with this effort. Over produced and too eager to please everyone, this disc just doesn't do it for me. There are a couple good songs that are definitely worth repeating such as the first single Like I Love You and Take Me Now (And She Said) featuring Janet. But a couple good songs do not a good cd make. With producers and artists such as The Neptunes, Brian McKnight, Janet Jackson, Timbaland, etc all colaborating and helping to make this disc, you kinda have to laugh when Justin says in interviews that its ""very organic"". Seems very put together to me. He suffers from the same problem Christina Aguilera does on her new disc ... too much hype and not much backing it up other than a few select tracks. In the end, at least they're both making Britney look good and that's all that matters. Right? Right."
3,alright effort,he's not the artist to die for but there are some great r&b and hip hop numbers on this album. Well done timbaland and pharrel! Brothas got skills.
3,"""Justified"" review","I was somewhat disappointed with this CD. The only songs I enjoyed were the ones that have been released. The others were not quite ""up to par"" to the released ones."
5,excellent,"I don't know what you people are saying. First off, if you're going to review, review it on the ALBUM itself and not how 'girly' you think he is. I think he's one of the few male artists who can sing in a high voice without being irritating (like Eamon..hmm maybe none of you would remember him). Anyway, I just got this CD last night. It's very excellent. I'm not too crazy about the song with Janet Jackson in it. The rest of the songs are either catchy as hell or very heartfelt. 'Never Again', 'Like I Love You', 'Take it From Here', 'Rock Your Body', and 'Cry Me a River' are my favorites. Great CD, I recommend it! -miz dj"
3,Michael Jackson Jr.,"I think Justin Timberlake's a good singer/performer in 'N Sync, but I'm not too sure he sounds as great as he does when he's harmonizing with the other guys. He sounds like a [copy of] Michael Jackson. I only listened to the CD like five times; unfortunately, I wasn't too drawn into it, but I'll give it another try another day."
5,Pretty Pleased,"The album is actually a lot more than I expected. I love NSYNC But this album shows a lot of different sides to Justin. He still remains true to his Pop status but he blends a little of r&b into it to add a little spice. ""Take it from here"" is a great example of that spice. ""Like I Love You"" his first single with Clipse adds a little funk to it. Every song is easy to listen to. From up tempo body shaking songs to smooth slow jams. Give him a chance. It's A Great Buy."
5,excellent!!!,I think this album is excellent i think Justin Timberlake is excellent. My favorite track is cry me a river i have to say it is better than any of the nsync albums LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Could've been the next Michael Jackson...,"I hated N'SYNC, but thought Timberlake could be the new king of POP minus the MJ history of controversy. So I kinda assumed this CD like MJ's Off the Wall, would be distance it self from the group that made him famous.So I thought ""Justified"" would be the new ""Off the Wall"". In a way it was. Like Off the Wall MJ worked with the top producers, and had some good music, but JT working with Neptunes and Timberland is not going to work, Timberland and Neptunes music sound to much off the same.Timberlake should've work with more experiance producers, not hip-hop producers(not that Im not a fan of hip-hop). JT can be the next MJ and even better(maybe not). But he needs to find a more R&B sound, not hip-hop.For Timberlakes next solo, he should go the ""Thiller"" route and do somthing TOTALLY DIFFERENT and sound the good doing it."
2,serious disappointment from a michael jackson wannabe,"i was seriously disappointed when i picked this one up. i'm an nsync fan, so i figured i'd go ahead an get this one. big mistake. first off... what's so special about this limited edition? it's a digi-pak? wow! so what. they are a pain to store, and just not an improvement at all. and for someone so vain, he couldve at least through something enhanced, like some pictures or something. and the music. he whines through most of the songs, and he seems to think he's michael jackson's re-incarnate. a couple of songs are really good, but the rest just put me to sleep. surely not worth my money. i highly recommend you preview this on a listening station at the store before spending your money. make sure you like the style of the whole album, because the rest of the album is not even remotely near as good as the first single Like I Love You."
2,Disappointed in Justified...,"When I heard the new single on the radio, I can remember really liking it and immediately going to download it. Since then, I've played ""Like I Love You"" probably a hundred times so I was looking forward to hearing the entire album Justified. What I found was pure disappointment...in fact, ""Like I Love You"" is probably the only good song on the whole album which makes it very disappointing the single rules the album. Most of the songs sound the same and seem to transport back to a mix of Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson. The only other track I found on the CD I'll even listen to besides ""Like I Love You"" is ""Nothin Else"". ""Nothin Else"" reminds me of some songs Timbaland produced for Nicole such as ""This Time I'm Gonna Make Ya Hot"". All in all, a very disappointing debut from an artist with tons and tons of potential...just stick more to the formula of ""Like I Love You"" and the lyrics will shine on the next album."
1,i hate justin,justin is sooooooo overrated! i can't believe what he did at the superbowl! im also wondering why he was even at the superbowl. don't waste your money on this junk.
1,TEEEEEEERRRRRRRIIIIBBBBLLLEEE,PLEASE STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL ALBUM WHICH IS BAD BEYOND DESCRIPTION.HORRIBLE OVERRATED ALBUMS LIKE THIS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECLINE OF THE RECORDING INDUSTRY.I DONT SEE EVEN A PIN DROP SIZE WORTH OF TALENT IN THIS AWFUL GUY WHO WAS AN UNJUST WINNER OF THE GRAMMY AWARD.DISPOSE THIS LOUSY CD OFF IMMEDIATELY AND GET ANY ALBUM FROM FLEETWOOD MAC INSTEAD.
5,"The Best Of 2002, Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This Review goes out to all the people that don't like Justin Timberlake.I Thought He was just rubish since he left N'Syce and went solo, but this LP has proved me wrong. It's got very good tracks such as ""Take It from here or ""Last Night"". The Worst song of the LP is ""Nothin' Else"" because it is just boring. Well 1 star being the lowest and 5 star being the highest I would give this LP 5 star maximum, and people reading my review would believe me."
2,"Doesn't ""Justify"" the Hype Surrounding Him","This is definitely a mediocre album. He's the most blatant Michael Jackson wannabe there ever was. He doesn't even TRY to be original. Could ""Rock Your Body"" be any MORE similar to Michael's 1979 song ""Rock With You""? Doesn't ""Senorita"" remind you way too much of Michael's 1983 song ""P.Y.T""? Justin, try to be a liitle more original on your next album- if there even is a next album?"
4,Justin-damn shame,"1. Senorita-4.7/52. Like I Love You 4.9/53. What You Got, (Oh No) 4.7/54. Take It From Here 4.6/55. Cry Me A River 4.5/56. Rock Your Body 4.7/57. Nothin' Else 4.8/58. Last Night 4.5/59. Still on My Brain 4.6/510. Take Me Now, (featuring Janet Jackson) 4.9/511. Right For Me 4.4/512. Let's Take A Ride 5/513. Never Again 4.3/5"
1,Justin must die,"Oh wow, people who like this kind of music make me sick! Why not go listen to something worth listening to...like maybe Led Zeppelin, or Cream, or even Elton John. This music is crap. The music industry is so downhill these days. I'm embarassed for these under-talented, overrated retards. People, listen to something other than the horrible music that thrives today!!!P.S. that one star was because Amazon MADE me put it...otherwise *gag*"
2,Pop drag queen goes solo.,"Drag queen? Cause he lip synchs. Michael Jackson should get credit for Like I Love Ya- he copies everything about him post 1984. In fact it would be cool to hear MJ do a cover of it. I wanted to throw up when I saw him ""perform"" the first cut from the album at the MTV VMA's... but I have too admit that the line ""You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya'. "" is kind of catchy... enough so that I was singing it to my cat this evening. It's probably a subtle jab at Britney. Like Christina Aguilera he hires rappers on the album that aren't very smooth or articulate in any sense of the word. My reccomendation is to spend the 4.99 on the single if you must but the album itself is not going to get worn out from playing it a thousand times, like with Off The Wall of Thriller if you know what I mean."
1,Justin Timberlake - what a loser,"Justin Timberlake is a pansy that thinks he can sing. What an idiot. His songs are crappy, his voice is crappy, he is, simply put, a big pile of crap. If you want music, don't buy this crap and use the money for this CD to go towards buying a Pink Floyd, Green Day, Led Zepplin, Ozzy Osbourne, or U2 (one of the earlier U2 albums because their recent album ""How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb"" isn't very good) CD. Even a (I can't believe I'm saying this) Kelly Clarkson CD would be worth more than this crap.If you have any brain cells, <u>DO NOT</u> BUY THIS CD!-Master Yoda,15, Swamp Road, Dagobah"
1,THIS GUY IS A JOKE!!!,"This guy was a nobody with his boyband and he still is a nobody.How could anybody call this garbage music.All the songs are typical cheesy pop songs with no substance whatsoever.The lyrics are laughable and his singing is mediocre at best.I couldnt find one song that I enjoyed throughout the whole album.He will be just another trend like britney spears,eminem and 50 cent.STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!!!"
2,Justified = No Meaning,"I think that Justins CD has no lyrical meaning at all, The 3 Songs that I even consider listening to are ""Never Again"", ""Cry Me A River"" & ""Like I Love You"" B'C it seems like Justin actually means the things that he says in those songs, The rest of the album gets on my nerves with the way he sings so many high notes, I Think Justin is a beautiful TALENTED man, If he'd sing the way he did in ""Never Again"" I'd buy every CD he ever put out, but I Think hes trying wayy to hard to fit in the R&B Category, I Think Justin Can do better for himself..."
1,Oh My God,i wished that i never bought this Cd in the first place.1)they over play his songs on the radio WAY too much.2) He does better with *Nsync3) his voice pitch makes me take an advil everytime i hear his songs because i get such a headache4) he sounds like a girl trying to sing5) Cry me a River is the only best song on there...and it isnt that good of qualtiy6) JC Chaez should be more famous than him...he has a better voicemy reasons are up there why i dont like this CD. i wish that hed just put a lid on his voice
3,It's O.K.,"Will all the people who give this 1 star stop saying that only stupid little kids like it? Most little kids aren't stupid. And, many older people like this music. It is not that bad.Note: I am not a little kid. I am actually a childrens' rights activist!"
4,Not anymore,"Justin isn't as big as he used to be. His sound changed. In a good way. But Ashlee Simpson aand Ryan Cabrera took his spot in my obsessive music life. This album is one of the best 2002 releases, and I bought it when KMart opened at 7 in the morning. The dance songs will get your feet moving, and ""Never Again"" will get you wanting to cry."
5,JUSTIFIED AS WELL AS SATISFIED,"I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS ALBUM! MY FAVORITE STYLE OF DANCE IS POP. MICHAEL JACKSON HAS ALWAY'S BEEN MY CHOICE OF SINGER TO DANCE TO. WELL, STEP ASIDE MR. JACKSON, AND LET MR. TIMBERLAKE THROUGH. JUSTIN, IF YOUR READING THIS(yeah right, like he would ever read this). FIRST OF ALL, I THINK, NO I KNOW THAT YOUR AN INCREDIBLE SINGER. I KNEW THAT ONE DAY YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR OWN MUSIC CAREER, AND IT WOULD BE WORTH WAITING FOR. WELL, IM GLAD I WAITED. YOUR AN INCREDIBLE DANCER AS WELL."
2,Bad R&B mixture,"I'll admit, that when I first heard Like I Love U, I thought it was amazing, and I still think that, I thought his solo project would be great, that is not the case however as most of this album is just filler material, I was going to give this cd one star, but Janet guesting on the track And She Said Take Me Now, adds a star to it, hopefully he'll realize that this mixture of R&B isn't going to work for him...."
5,Best Damn CD out,"Okay these 1 star and 2 star reviews are bull, the only reason i only gave it a 5 is because i cant give it higher. The Beats are stupendous, and everytrack is worth listening to. Justins boy band image is completely madeover through this cd to a stunning young rnb artist. I got made fun of at school for listenin to this stuff, but once i let people listen they felt what i felt, and loved every second of it. Dont judge the artist by his past group, judge him by his NEW style in the music industry....bravo justin....bravo"
2,the king of flop,"justin will never, ever be another michael jackson. And he will never be r&b, he's just pop trash disguised as hip hop/r&b. Where would he be without timbaland & neptunes helping him out. They should have just saved their tracks for a real r&b artist. If you want true r&b music, go buy alicia keys CD"
1,Justified NO TALENT!,"Just to make things clear, I didn't buy this album and never will. So, when he made the video to ""Cry Me A River"", he thinks he's cool dissing the more uncool Britney? I don't think so! The song sounds like a tortured Michael Jackson and so much more to ""Rock Your Body"" which reminds me of the classic Jackson 5! I can't believe his imagining he's the king of pop and that's far from happening. No singing talent and no character. Stay away from this immitator! I might have given him credit about something but I've come up with the question... ""Is there talent at all?"""
3,pretty good...maybe 3 1/4,"it's funny that some people haven't even listened to the album, yet they give it one star like they know something. kinda ruins it for the people who come to amazon.com looking for a honest review...i thought it was pretty good, concerning i wasn't really too fond of ""Like I Love You"". but this album sure does have it's positives. It's starts off with ""senorita"", which is one of my favorite songs on the album. It's kinda upbeat, but not TOO much. other strengths on this album include ""cry me a river"", ""nothin' else"", ""take me now"" and my favorite...""never again"". i'm not sure about some of the songs on the album, but then again, i'm not too much of a r&b person. so if you liked ""like i love you"", go ahead and try this album out. if not...i'd pass."
1,Who does he think he is? MJ?,"Untalented copycat/wannabe of the legendary genius that is MJ!He does not write those rubbish songs and he does not have a voice. Justified is a Neptunes album featuring Timberlake.Now he labelled himself the New King Of Pop. Everybody knows who was, still is and will forever be the King(MJ)Timberlake cant write songs,cant sing, cant dance etc. He cant do ANYTHING! untalented wannabeBad songs, bad album. Don't waste your time and money on this. Keep away from Justified.I wish my review is helpful to music fans.thank you"
1,awful,"I bought this CD only because my girl janet is on it, and I loved like 2 other songs but I got over them fast and I felt as though his singing and songwriting skills were weak, as well as his dancing. And he was a sellout on the superbowl, it's a good thing he's not doing the motown 45 special anymore, he is a disgrace to music and deserves no such honor. Do us all a favour and find some better music to listen to instead of this punk"
1,GOD HELP US!!,"The song ""Cry Me A River"" has to be THE worst song of the past ten years. It's just beyond listenable. Painful to the ears. A total assault to the ears. Does this guy think he's the next Michael Jackson? Justin Timberlake's falsetto vocals on this track are just embarrassing. And it's pretty bad when the backup vocalist on your songs are better than your own. I think the female singer who sings ""talk to me, boy"", on the song Rock Your Body, should get a recording contract of her own, not Justin. And it's pretty scary that mostly girls under 16, who are the majority of Justin's fans, are hearing lyrics such as, ""Gonna have you naked by the end of this song."" If i had a little daughter and she started singing lyrics like that, i'd toss Justin's cd in the trash and expose her to better music, not a marketing scam.Justin's high falsetto vocals are probably the most annoying, worst thing your ears will be subjected to this or any year. He sounds like a losing contestant from American Idol."
3,GOOD MUSIC BUT WEAK VOICE.,"This is a really good cd but I loses a couple of stars, because Timberlake's voice is just weak. This cd shows me how much he needs J.C. Chasez to overpower his voice. I mean the voice is not bad, but it just doesn't have a presence like Usher for example. Anyways once I move away from that, there are some really good songs on this cd. I really like jams 2-6. My favorites being ""Like I Love You"" and ""What You Got"". I also want to point out that Timberlake works very well with Timbaland and the Neptunes. He has some good slow jams, and some fast ones. By the way I just love the ""Cry Me a River"" song, how original and nothing like anyone has done before. The boy is definitely creative! Well try the cd out because you might be surprised."
3,Nice Album - But he might as well dawn the glitter glove...,"Ya know, I have to honestly say I'm not a big N'Sync fan. But was curious where Justin was going to go with this, since he teamed up with the likes of Pherrel, Chad & Timbaland. It's got some cool songs like What You Got & Cry Me a River - and I'll admit I thought Like I Love You was catchy ... after I heard it the first 20 times on the radio. BUT there are so many Michael Jackson references & resemblances on the CD - Rock Your Body and Last Night might as well have been featured on MJ's Off the Wall. Can only stress - more originality and LESS Michael, Justin. Of course it's just an opinion - this IS worth buying."
4,Feelin Justified,"Now, I'm a thirty-year old female who's not really into the boy-band thing, however I like Nsync. So I was waiting to see what Mr. Timberlake would come up with. Finally copped the CD. I was going to have someone burn it for me, but after I heard a few more songs, I actually didn't mind spending money for it. I feel like some other reviewers - if the song doesn't catch me in 1st 10 to 20 seconds then I skip it. With the exception of 2 or 3 songs, I'm feelin most of the CD. It's a little hip-hop, a little RnB, and a little pop. I like the variety. "" Take it from Here"" is my jam and ""What you got for me"" is probably the tightest song on the CD. I too look forward to the next Nsync CD"
1,Horrible!,I originally bought this album just for Cry Me A River and the rest of the album wasn't even close to good. I recommend you just digitally buy Cry Me A River or just listen to the album online before you buy it... Even my Mom didn't like it and she loves everything! Lol I just recommend you get his sophomore albumFutureSex / LoveSoundswhich is way better than this one!
5,"""Justin On His Own""","With the release of Justin Timberlake's solo album he proved to the world he was more than a member of a simple boy band. ""Justified"" showed Timberlake's ability to be a strong solo performer and with its ultimate release ""Future Sex/Love Sounds"" he showed the public he was a talent with staying power with an ardent fan base who loved his music.""Justified"" garnered Justin with two Grammys, including wins for Best Pop Album and Best Pop Vocal for ""Cry Me A River"" and ultimately sold an impressive ten million copies worldwide.Highlights include ""Cry Me A River"", ""Rock Your Body"", ""Still on My Brain"", and ""Senorita"". Justin also co-wrote the entire CD's 13 tracks."
4,Come On!,"For all the people hating JT and the album in their reviews, I mean, I'll admit it, he does sound like MJ, but that's the point! ""Justified"" is the album ""Invincible"" should've been. If Mike was singing these songs, everyone would be calling it pure genius and Michael would've fully reclaimed his throne. But Justin sounds enough like Michael, but with his own flavor, and most of the songs are excellent. Typical of most albums today, there are some misses, but overall, you cannot tell me you don't like some of these songs. I think people's personal opinions of Justin Timberlake himself are prohibiting them from just listening. Listen for yourself and put the background of the man himself behind if you choose to listen to this album. It is worth listening to to judge for yourself."
1,MY EARS WANT TO KILL ME,"Yes. My ears want to kill me for listening to such crap. I bought this cd because I actually liked Justin in Nsync. And while I did not expect a rehash of old Nsync material, I expected something that I would enjoy. ""Like I Love You' made me think I would like this cd but aside from that song the rest of this album is boring, trite, badly sung, badly written, boring, (I know I said that already, but damn, this is one boring album!)Then with the Super Bowl fiasco. That for me cemented my intense dislike for him as a performer. (....)"
1,Deserves No Stars,"Oh my gosh, there is so much that is so wrong about this tripe.Justin seems to think he is the Stevie Wonder of the 21st century. Please. He has no soul. He has feeling. His musicianship and showmanship (as displayed on the Grammy awards)are nil.Not quite sure how he won but he did. Then again nobody has ever accused the Grammy awards of being based on talent.If I remember my Grammy history correctly, The Beatles were pretty much overlooked time and time again by the academy.Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. If you insist on picking up a copy...wait about a year and you will find it deeply discounted after Justin's career takes a dive.Awful, awful stuff. It should come packaged with a vomit bag."
1,God help us!,This music is horrible.I think n'sync sounded better.This guy has no hope as a solo artist.This the most useless pop i've ever heard.If there's more to come from this guy then god help us.
1,We need higher standards here,"Justin Timberlake, aside from being a drain on society, is also a talentless hack, who desires to be Michael Jackson (an interesting aspiration) and have all his famous friends hide what he really is...a guy whose 15 minutes should have been up long ago. A guy who is way too concerned about image, and sounds like a cat in heat...there, I said it."
5,The New King of Pop (and R&B),"Justin has went from boyband heartthrob to pop icon with his debut album. This CD is nothing short of amazing! I will admit that I am an Nsync fan so maybe I hold some bias, but above all I am a music fan. Songs like ""Senorita"", ""Like I Love You"", and ""Rock Your Body"" show his dance floor appeal while ""(And She Said) Take Me Now"" and ""Let's Take a Ride"" reveal strong R&B roots and pure talent. The production (Brian McKnight, Timbaland, Neptunes) is incredible, the lyrics (predominately written by Justin himself) are creative and playful, and overall this is an album that people should remember for awhile.P.S.If you're a fan of this album honestly try ""Up Against the Wall"", ""That's When I'll Stop Loving You"", ""I Thought She Knew"", and ""Selfish"" from Nsync. I promise you won't be disappointed!"
3,Justified in giving a listen..,"Although I would have laughed had you told me I'd be listening to Justin Timberlake a few weeks ago, I am listening to this album. I watched the ""rock your body"" video one bleary-eyed morning on tv and something about the catchy bass beat appealed to me. I think it reminded me of some pre-90's R & B sounds (a la Chic). Whateve it is, my son and I groove to this track as we drive. There's something Stevie Wonder-ish about the production of some songs. An earlier Michael Jackson vocal style (or what my son would say ""sounds like a girl"") makes it easy for me to imagine Justin modelling his voice after black r & b singers. There's also one track which is a kind of Missy Elliot rip, but I give him credit for trying. Confused? have a listen .. It's justified."
3,Listenable...,"I never thought I would even listen to Justin Timberlake(since he's from N'sync, and I don't really fancy pop). I 1st heard 'Like I love You' on the radio, and the song just keep on playing in my head. I was surprised to know that it's from Justin. Justin=pop, song=hip-hop? I went home and d/l it again and listen for a couple of times. It never failed to get my feet moving, don't you all agree? Oh yes, I do like 'Cry me a river'too..but the irony is that I don't find his voice all that, its too high pitch and sounds like a girl. However, the songs are listenable, and if you don't stop to think its from Justin, the songs would actually get your head bopping."
4,WOW,"well, well, well, justin. this album is a breakaway from his former N'SYNC pop style music. what i like about the album are the very melo tracks like ""take it from here"" and ""let's take a ride"". i dont really like the fast paced songs but the ballads are just right. with these diverse track genres, i think this album is exellent, having something for everyone."
4,Just what I expected,"When I first listened to the cd, honestly, I was oddly disappointed. Then I listened to it again, and lo and behold!, it turned out to be pretty doggone tight. I love 'rock your body', 'what you got', 'cry me a river', 'let's take a ride'...i guess i pretty much like the whole cd. its really cool that he can take a leave of absence from nsync and come with somethin as tight as this..and to all those hatas talkin about him trying to be like Michael, how many albums did Michael sell?....Anyway, I recommend this album, seriously. Its pretty versatile. You'll be pleased, I'm sure."
5,THE BEST!,"Justin did it this time! He belongs! He is a true Solo Artist. As much as I do love NSYNC, Justin is a true star. This CD is EXCELLENT, the right blend of all music in one with Exceptional singing! I LOVE IT, recommend everyone to check it out!"
1,No way!,"The only thing I can say is that some of the songs on his CD are catchy. However, his voice sucks. If you ask me, Nick Lachey would sound much better singing these lyrics."
5,Great debut solo CD!,"I don't understand why people seem to hate this CD so much! I've never particularly liked Justin's voice, even when he was in 'N Sync. One of my friends recommended listening to this CD, and let me tell you, I think it's great! I didn't think I'd like it, either. Each song has a great beat and sounds good. The only song I don't like is ""Senorita."""
1,ughhhhhhhhhhh!!!!,Ughh... This CD doesnt even deserve one star. He's just as awful as Britney Spears! Save your money and DON'T buy this!
5,No................... I'm lovin' it!,"When I heard that Justin Timberlake was coming out with a solo project I knew it would be incredible. Ummmm...so it turns out that it was. This album is going to be a classic. He couldn't of been any smarter than to work with the Neptunes and Timbaland. These producers/writers/musicians are the cream of the music industry crop. The beats, melodies, and words make me want to get up and dance and cry. These songs have gotten me through good times, going out, and bad times, breakin up. I pop in Justified about once a day when I am driving and it is a nice day out. It is one of my top picks for road trips and when I am getting ready with my girls to go out for the night. Justin, all the props in the world and by the way, you are a very talented guy...all the luck in future projects!"
1,One star is too much!,Is this for buying or the complimentary cd given by old navy? Grammy's for this guy....You gotta be joking right??? This guy is so untalented its a super joke that he is even taken seriously.Highlight of this album: Goes well with the Pride flag.
1,Get a musical clue,"Why would anyone be so gulible as to waste money on this processed garbage. Hey, let's manufacture the next pop star and there will be enough mindless sheep out there that we might make a few bucks. When there has been so much quality talent out recently: Maroon5, Coldplay, Five for Fighting. I would put him in the class with Bobby Sherman, David Cassidy, Leif Garrett. Close your eyes and open your ears!"
1,I love the neptunes and timbaland,"they have created such a good album very inspired by mj's off the wall, only problem is justin's on it"
1,Very Bad,"This CD was very bad, it was a disgrace to all NSYNC fans out there. Who is he trying to be Michael Jackson? Take my advice do not buy this CD it is a waste of your money."
1,Justify This!,"Justified is like Micheal Jackson so much that children run from him. He has contributed one good thing, the song Cry Me A River covered by retard punk band Cannibal Goat Eater, segued into Billy Jean. CGE are bigger than anyone else over here. I wuld recommend phoning 6789-543 and asking for Cannibal Goat Eater's Retard Mother(Singer). You'll get a response I guarantee."
1,Unjustified,"Where to start???? Justin Timberflake (Crumbles under pressure) is trying to be Michael Jackson or the Bee Gees but fails miserably. He cant dance or sing, I dont know what Britney saw in him. Poor girl. Sniper the assclown. Never buy this album not even at a car boot sale, not for 5p/10c cos thats where he'll end up selling cds."
5,justin did it again,im a happy gay man. and i love justin timberlake. he is hott and he can sing. his self debut solo album proves to all his fans that he will be around for a long time entertaining us with his voice and his body. buy this album now
1,No pop here.,"""Like I Love You"" made me go out and buy the CD when it was released. After listening to the whole thing I was sorry I did. It's ALL R&B! No pop or anything like ""Like I Love You"". Big disappointment to me."
2,"After Playing ""Justified"",I""m NOT","I pray this isn't the future of music.There are a couple of tracks worth listening to,but the rest are just drum machines and rap,and Justin trying to be Black.{Hey,I can rap too!!!}"
1,IF I could i would give ZERO,I know theres a ton of fans of justin timberlake but just face the facts....He's not a good singer...at least not to me. I bought this cd a week ago and ya know how sometimes a cd will eventually grow on you? I tried that. It doesnt work.
2,Let's See Who Gets The Credit,"Alrighty....the neptunes wrote half the songs and Timbland wrote half the songs. And this guy keeps on singing like a girl, and is getting all the attention because he's from N'Sync. This guy is from the pop teeniebopper music industry, where barely anyone writes their own songs. Now who should get the credit here? I would DEFINITLY give credit to the neptunes and Timbland, get their CD's, theyre excellent songwriters and they make the dopest beats (and not to mention catchy, which is why this album is selling)....but this...ugh. They made the beats catchy, but the fact that this guy is part of the one of fakest teeniebopper boy bands in history turns me away. Get the producers albums if you like the songs, not the album from this guy."
4,INVINCIBLE....Whoops! That title is taken!,"If MJ had jettisoned 1/3 of his last album, hooked up with Timbaland and other contemporary hip-hop masters, added his sister Janet on a cut, threw in some funky beats, did some patented ""screams"", then he might have had the winner that Timberlake has.I dig the seductive ""Senorita"", ""Take It From Here"", ""Rock Your Baby"" ""Let's Take A Ride"", and the slammin' ""Last Night"".If Timberlake can maintain this level in his sophomore effort, he may have a career beyond his ""boyhood"".He'll do fine as long as he doesn't completely emulate his hero and become a prisoner of his own success."
3,Pretty Nice CD,"Overall, I think this CD is a nice listen and it's a good effort for a solo debut from Justin. I prefer to hear Justin on the faster tracks than on the slower ones. A few of the beats need work such as Senorita, the first track, which is off-beat in a bad way. Timbaland produced the hottest tracks including the single, ""Cry Me a River."" I like the fact that Justin puts some soul into his music and his vocals are really nice. This CD gets a 7 out of 10 from me, or 3 stars according to the Amazon.com rating system. I think that it is a good, consistent listen but he still has some room to grow. The best track on the album, to me, is the song titled ""Last Night,"" that one is HOT. Check this disc out, it's a good listen."
3,not what i expected...,"when i picked up this cd i was so excited to hear justin's new stuff. but when i gave it a listen, i was shocked. it was not anything like what i thought it was going to be. and in some cases, that's good. but in this case...many of the rhymes seem to be really elementary, stuff i could have thought of in 3rd grade.but not to give the man any credit...some of the songs are really great. like never again. great song.but the whole album makes me wonder...will justin ever truly sing by himself, or will he continue to colaberate?"
5,Absoultely Terrific,"I've always been an Nsync fan. And i honestly think that Justin did a really good job on his album. Every song has it's own individual sound to it. You have your uptempo dance songs like 'Rock Your Body', uptempo balleds like 'Cry Me A River', and emotional songs like 'Never Again'. He's an amazing entertainer, with alot of talent. I highly recommend this album. It'll just blow you away."
1,Most overrated album of 2002!!,"All hype, no substance! I don't think I could say it better! As much as I love 'N Sync, Justin's album does not impress me! The songs all sound the same! It's pretty much the same hip-hop R and B beat, but different lyrics! The only songs worth listening to are the hit singles ""Like I Love You"", and ""Cry Me A River""! The third single ""Rock Your Body"" sounds like a track from Michael Jackson's reject pile! This has got to be the worst album of 2002, as well as most overrated! Go buy Nick Carter's album instead, the most underrated CD of 2002! Even if you don't like all the songs, at least it has variety!!"
4,Great!!,"Justin's debut solo album is phenominal! If he were to go back to N Sync that would be the dumbest move of his carrer. He was the star of that group and everyone knows it, want proof? Have you heard from anybody since Justin came out with a solo album?The album has great lyrics, production & background music. He shines on ballads ""Still on my Brain"" & ""Never Again"", but can still rock a function with ""(And She Said) Take me Now"", ""Last Night"" & the album's guitar laced lead single ""Like I Love You"" (Featuring the Clipse).""Rock Your Body"" & ""Cry Me a River"" are on here too, as well as one of Justin's brightest moments, ""Take it From Here""On top of all this, he has got to be the most gorgeous man on the planet! He should really consider playgirl & show off that tremendous body.But regardless, he is an incredible talent which can't be denied and he will be very successful if he remains a solo act."
2,"Could have been worse, but not by that much","Words of advice to upcoming male pop singers: Never try to be Michael Jackson because it will not work no matter how hard you try. On this mostly forgettable album, Justin Timberlake tries to emulate MJ, and it is clear that the attempt is pretty unsuccessful. ""Rock Your Body"" is catchy and danceable, if vocally insignificant, but that is the only song on this album that is even remotely worth hearing. All in all, definitely not a justifiable masterpiece."
3,It Was Okay,"I was really looking forward to this release. ""Like I Love You"" had really grown on me and when I found out that Timbaland and the Neptunes had produced this album, I knew I had to have it. After several listenings, I have come to the conclusion that this CD is not all that it was cracked up to be. Some of the beats are tight, some of the sounds are good, but there is nothing really to get excited about. Justin has a really thin voice so there isn't much vocally on this cd. There a few good dance songs though, like ""Like I Love You"" and ""Take Me Now."" The current single ""Cry Me a River"" is a great Timbaland-produced track as well as ""Oh No (What You Got)."" A lot of the other songs leave much to be desired."
4,Totally Justified In My Purchase,"I was very skeptical about buying this album, I didn't know if it would be too POP for me. But I read a review and took a chance. WOW! I am so glad I bought this album, my friends laughed because he's a pop singer and I'm an older Black woman. They ate their words when I popped it in. The production is clean and nice. If you like Ginuwine, Usher you'll like this album. Favorite cuts: Take It From Here, Rock Your Body (light party jam). Micheal Jackson could have easily made the same album."
2,"......Just Buy The Singles, The Rest Is Crap","I wanted to believe the hype. Awards for this and that...but this CD is full of fillers. Geez, what a coincidence....all the good songs are singles...the rest are badly produced along with cheesy lyrics.Like I Love You, Cry Me a River, Rock Your Body, Senorita and Take It From Here (not a single, but should be) are awesome....but don't waste your money on the whole CD.I'm Lovin' ItWorthy Of"
1,No longer NSYNC with todays youth,"Justin Timberflake tries to establish himself as a man capable of standing on his own. Unfortunately he needs a cane, and that cane is a metaphor for the other members of NYSNC. I do give him a little credit for his hit single 'Justified'. 'Justified' was a bit sassy but it certainly wasn't enough to 'justify' a purchase. ..."
2,An OK debut start,"This is an OK debut start.If Timberlake wasn't a name before this CD, then this album would have never sold what it did.Mar my words.... His follow-up to this will sell a tenth at most!"
3,not all that,"The neptunes are played out so their songs don't have an effect on me like they used to. The timbaland produced tracks are good though, cry me a river, oh no what you got and the song with janet are good though. The music isn't bad, but the lyrics are completely cheesy, and happen to be written by justin. ..."
2,"thrown together in 2 weeks, what do you expect?","the neptunes claimed they listened to michael jackson's off the wall and recorded this CD in a period of 2 weeks, the result? A lousy attempt at trying to emulate the king of pop/r&b. I don't mind the songs cry me a river and rock your body, and the janet duet(which is the only reason I bothered buying this CD) but justin isn't talented at all as a solo artist, JC is much more talented and edgy, justin is just a chipmunk screaming for attention and ndefinitely never worth my money again."
5,Reminiscent of Early MJ,"This music reminds me of the sound of ""off the wall"" and ""Thriller"" MJ that I loved so much as a child of the 80s. The Neptunes did an amazing job with the tracks, which is THE selling point of this CD. But Justin, though his voice is not as strong as some, is nontheless a good singer. I really enjoy all the songs except the piano ballad where hes crying about his girlfriend leaving. Fortuneatly that's the only one of its kind, the rest are great."
1,This album SUCKS!,"and I'm not joking. there's like 1 good song on it, the rest are trash. he sounds like a pre-teen girl when he sings and his songs suck. throw this in the garbage, along with his career!"
1,UGH!,"Ew! This CD is such a Hwang! Man, you should get Bea Arthur's Broadway CD instead! Bea is the greatest! GOLDEN GIRLS FOREVER!"
3,Get some damn originality,"This is a good Pop album overall, but I'm sorry, the hype was too much. If Justin's aim was to create an Off The Wall or Thriller for the new millennium, he should have taken some more tips from Michael Jackson circa-20 years ago - hire a producer that's going to give him a sound like no other. Who in this genre in the music industry hasn't worked with Neptunes or Timbaland in the last 3 years?The entire album is just above average stuff that has been done before, and better, by other artists."
2,not all that,"Justin and the Neptunes and Timbaland admitted to listening to michael jackson's off the wall CD for 2 weeks straight while recording this album at the same time, but the only songs well done are cry me a river, take me now and rock your body though someone else should have sang them and they sound no different from already existing songs from as early as off the wall to as late as brandy or aaliyah or some other r&b artist. Justin ripped off r&b that has been around for years and some stupid justin fans on this board have the nerve to call him original, it's unbelievable. and they don't realize that by doing that they are discrediting black musicians and songwriters who enhanced the r&b genre, and this album is full of neptunes and timbaland who are also black. I give THEM the credit not justin."
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"Justin was always one of the most talented guys in *NSYNC. He could dance very well, and vocally he could hit notes some guys will never be able to hit. I personally never had a crush on him, like some girls, but I didn't exactly dislike him.When Justin came out with this CD, I was kind of ""So what?"" about it. Then I saw part of the music video for ""Rock Your Body"". Sure, it had cool music, and a neat video, but the lyrics were so trashy! I was rather surprised. ""Cry Me A River"" was okay, but a little too slow for my liking.After all I've seen, and after all I've heard, Justin Timberlake is garbage. He's a disgusting man who needs to be rescued from the sleez he's become.I recommend these not only talented, but cleaner singers:Jonny LangClay Aiken"
1,"Cry him a river, give me a break","Okay I'll keep my name anonoymous! Anyways....Okay Justin, if you are that desperate for us to cry you a river, and you want it that bad, we will. No as a matter of fact, we'll do more than that. We'll cry you an ocean and a sea. Those tears will be from the pure hapiness during and after the time you disappear and die."
1,I hate the person and the music.,"Justin Timberlake is such a bad singer. Plus he ripped off Janet Jackson's bra at the super bowl, that stupid piece of crap. Anyway, he doesn't write his own music. He stinks and he would crumble in a real life situation."
1,"CHEAP DISPOSABLE ""MUSIC""","10 year old kids may enjoy this sort of crap, but people who enjoy real music wont."
5,justin is justified,justin i love you and your music. you are da bomb. i listen to your cd everyday allday. my favrite track is cry me a river. i love your voice and the way you dance and sing. keep up the good work. your number #1 fan for life.
1,Horrible,"I still haven't recieved my CD and it has been a month. I guess I'll have to contact the seller again so that I can get a refund, although I would think that she would contact me to see if I had recieved the CD since I've already emailed her once. I am not a satisfied customer at all!"
2,i can't stand the guy,"but several of the tracks with their musical production were well done though I've heard it all before with MJ. I credit the neptunes and timbaland for their musical genius but it should have been invested in someone who's actually talented. I heard some of the songs were given to mj but he didn't want them, big mistake. There would have been better melodies, better vocals and much better songwriting than what justin did to these tracks on this album."
2,Um...no.,"Whoever said that this CD had MJ/80's retro quality...lied. Whoever said that half the songs on the album sound like one endless song...was right and deserves a trophy :D I must admit, the songs are catchy and infectious when you first listen to the CD. But truthfully, the CD makes Justin sound like a droning whiner with hopelessly shallow love songs and weird club hits. The best song on the CD, lyrics and music combined, is probably Justin's single ""Cry Me A River""; although the song itself isn't totally spectacular (and was played to DEATH!!!), it is the most emotionally charged and true-sounding song on the album. The rest of it just sounds like a pre-teen's imaginings of what love, romance, sex, and clubbing *must* be like. ""Still On My Brain"" has a pretty sound, music-wise, but the lyrics are uninspired. Some of the other songs on the CD are okay but lack substance."
3,"Interesting, but merely that.","It's got maybe 4 good songs on it, and the rest is filler. If Justin hadn't gone out with Britney, and now Cameron, he would be facing the same fate as his other NSYNC counterparts, desperately trying to get recognition. Does anyone know where Chris Kirkpatrick is? Or what he's doing? My point exactly. Do yourself the favor and go to Itunes and download the 4 decent songs to save yourself the money."
4,Really Good Stuff!,"Ok...if you have read my other reviews...well if you haven't then I mostly write for R&B albums and Rap albums. This time I was like I will give JT a listen because I heard of all his collabo's with the Neptunes on this album.I expected this cd to have a Pop sound to it. But was I surprised when I popped this cd in my cd changer. Very, Very, good stuff. Folks I am serious. This is coming from a black male that listen's to Underground rap and Eastcoast rap.I actually really liked this cd. But.......there is always a but.......The Neptunes kinda make the production sound the same on some of the songs. And Timberland's productions.....well some of them.......are just mediocre and just don't go with the style of JT.Overall good cd. I read reviews that JT might be the next MJ......well not really but he sounds like MJ a lot. I don't know if that is bad or not but I am all for it. MJ is whack anyway so we need a newer MJ sound. Peace!"
3,tolerable but no musical genius,this album is totally michael jackson influenced with a hip hop flavour thanks to timbaland and neptunes. I don't like justin the person at all but I have to admit his songwriters have mad talent even if he doesn't. The beats on this are HOT!
4,good on his own,the album is not great but it's pretty good. he could have done without the last song and it would have been just a perfect album for my taste of course. i like all the songs that played on the radio and all the ones that didn't. it shows here how talented justin really could be and it also helps that he got to work with very talented people.
2,well......,I like some of his song but I think he should take some singing lessons. He also tries to be all macho and I'm the best style. He is very hot and cute but it's not enough. Sorry but gotta pass on this CD folks.
4,Impressed,"I was never a fan of N'Sync, but I am definitely a fan of Justin Timberlake's. Justin has soul and it shows on this CD. His talent and the talent of his production team is apparent.If he can follow up ""Justified"" with something just as hot, he'll be around for a while. My personal favorites are ""I'll Take It From Here"" and ""Let's Take a Ride"".Consider this CD highly recommended."
4,Proved me wrong!,This CD has definitely proved me wrong! I thought this was going to be another teen pop albumn but it turned out to be jammin'! I pretty much liked majority of the songs....only a couple of them were alright. This albumn is definitely one of the best albumns I've bought this year.
1,no,"look not all 10 year olds are mindless idiots...ok?I admit this cd sucks but why do you ""mature and older people who actually know what they're talking about"" always have to point your targets at 10 year olds?anyways, this cd sucks and all you fans of justin should get a life and actually listen to his songs instead of saying this cd rocks because you like him-note-im not a 10 year old"
2,MJT.,"I've never been one to jump on a bandwagon, so maybe that helps to describe my initial loathing for this album. However upon listening to this album, my leap from the band wagon just seemed to be easier.After working in a record store for 2 years and having this album shoved down my throat day in day out since its release, my contempt has only grown.I find this album to be offensive, (to music, mostly), overplayed and over gratified. I think this album has no depth, or anything that makes you want to stay up all night listening to it, unless you're on drugs, or horribly drunk and wanting to ""get it on"" with your ugly roommate.However I do give props to JT for successfully ripping off everything Michel Jackson has ever done, and some how claiming it for his own.And, I do have to admit the one song with male/female parts makes me jump around and dance like an idiot (providing I'm one drugs or booze)."
3,Not What I expected. Needs more catchiness.,"When I heard ""Like I Love You"" for the first time, I said to myself this album is gonna be hot. The song is catchy, with its R&B;, uptempo sound. When the album hit the charts and sold like hot bread, that made me a beliver more and more that this album was hot. But to tell you the truth, the other songs on the album are a bit lazy and are not as catchy as ""Like I Love You"". They just don't have have that certain beat that I like about a song, weird sounds coming from each song make them sound even worse. ...Justin has a so and so album here. I hope on his second album he doesn't use the ""Neptunes"", they are writing for too many artiste and the songs from different artiste albums are beginning to sound too much alike because of their input on too many songs these days. We need some orginality, not the same song being recycled over and over again. ..."
4,Great Debut!!...,"The only reason I picked up this CD is because I read The Neptunes produced most of the tracks. They are my favorite producers right now. I loved their music and beats BEFORE I knew who they were. And I also dug Timbaland's work with the late Aaliyah. So I took a chance and bought the CD, to everyone's dismay, since I'm not an NSYNC or Justin fan. I heard ""Like I love You"" on the radio and really loved the acoustic guitar and the live drums. I figured the whole album would be to my liking, and it was. It's very sexy (the songs, not Justin!) The lyrics could be a little less mundane, but they sound like they are coming from someone Justin's age. And I'm very impressed with him writing his own lyrics. That shows promise as a true artist. Now all he needs to do is find his OWN voice and stop imitating Michael J. It's not good when you try to sing like someone else and not even come close to being as good. But anyway, forget about NSYNC fame and get this album for what it is, a gem."
1,stupid me,"Damn the media and my subceptibility to it. I bought this CD since I liked 'Cry me a River' and it was one of two songs I liked. Also, I loved Christina A.'s CD so much that I thought they had to be on the same wavelength. They're NOT. I stopped listening to this CD when JT's says "" Better have you naked by the end of this song"" what??? that's the best you can do? Did it ever occur to him that the song with Janet Jackson would work better as a slow jam? A week later I gave it to a 12 year old girl who loves it. Figures."
3,Could have been better,"Most of the album was produced by the Neptunes and Timbaland. The Neptunes songs sound like rewrites of some old Kelis hits, but that's ok since most people never heard the Kelis CD. The Timbaland songs seem to fit Justin's style better. Even so, they sound watered down, like they had to be pop-ified so that Justin would get enough radio play. I remember some old Aliyah songs that sound like she was doing battle with the beats because they were so difficult to craft a lyrical arrangement. This is definitely not the case here. Buy this CD only if you are a Justin Timberlake fan, or if you don't have enough musical taste to like anything other than pop music. If you like 'Cry me a river' that much, just watch TRL or listen to your local pop music station and you'll hear it more than you ever wanted to. Nothing groundbreaking, and none of the songs are particularly memorable. I'll listen to the CD about 2 more times and then it will get lost and I won't notice."
3,I'm not a fan,"I'm not a fan of Justin or Nysnc. So 3 stars coming from me is high. I hate to say it but Justin isn't half bad. Now that he's broken away from Nysnc he has shown he can be a real artist. While he does come off as arrogant and conceited, there are times when those layers are stripped away and you see the real person. I got the impression from him that he was a total, soulless jerk. Like when he sold Britney out to a radio station so they would play his song more. But when I saw an interview of him with his mother I saw he's still a little boy who hasn't grown up. Now that Justin is performing solo, he will have the chance to do this. Hopefully, his next solo album will grow from this."
4,Justin: The new king of pop?,"Justin Timberlake proves hes a major solo star on his first debut album Justified. An excellent album that showcases his smooth vocals and his knack for writing catchy pop songs. Throw in a few top producers like The Neptunes and you got one of the top albums of the year. Starting off strongly is the sensual dance track Senorita, then moving into his first single, the irresistable Like I Love you then moving into Michael Jackson territory on Rock Your Body, and some classic 70's soul music on Last Night. Justin proves hes got the goods, especially on Cry Me A River. An infectious chorus and heartfelt lyrics make it the strongest cut on the album. If there are any complaints, it's that the album is a little to noisy. Too much going on in the song that it gets distracting, and it takes away from Justins vocals. Other than that, an excellent album that deserves all kinds of accolades for Justin."
1,BRING BACK THE SINGLES PLEASE!,"This album is only good by the singles(""Like I Love You"", ""Cry Me A River"", ""Rock Your Body"", ""Señorita""), no other tracks are good, are pure fillers, maybe we can save ""take Me Now"" by the special appereance by the old Janet Jackson, not worth buy in it. Please bring back the comercial singles!."
5,Better than expected,This album was definitely not what I was expecting from a former boy band member. A certified R&B album regardless of what you hear anyone else say. It it clearly easy to see why Justin was the breakout star of his group.
2,C'mon people!!!,"This cd is not that good! I do respect the fact that this one-time boy band member decided to work with some great producers for a more mature sound. However, when you really think about it, Justin is simply a product. Anybody with a decent voice can work with top notch producers and create a hit. That's a no-brainer. I actually lost respect for the guy when he stated that his top cds for 2003 were 5O cent and Jay Z. I expected some more eclectic listening for someone who claims to have grown up with soul around his house. Where are the influential artists that inspired this album. He simply let the producers take over. His musical choices only confirmed what I had thought already - he's a product. Why do we elevate these people to such heights? For really great soul/r&b artists, listen to Sade or Jill Scott. These two ""artists"" are actively involved in the music they put out."
5,Truly Justified,"""Justified"" is Justin Timberlake's solo debut apart from 'N Sync. He teams up with producers The Neptunes in this monumental pop album. For the first time in his career, he wrote every song. Such immense album quality places him with legends Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, Al Green, and more. He received five Grammy nominations for 2003, including Album of the Year. Other collaborations: Brian McKnight, Clipse, and Janet Jackson, add extra music flavor in the perfect spots. Timberlake's combination of pop, dance, modern R&B, and ole skool R&B offers a piece of music history that has been missing for a long time. His voice in every single is amazing. Such talents prove that he's much more than a sex symbol. He also proves that he'll be around for many more years. ""Justified"" is a great album for everyone. Many will be enlightened. Hopefully, he releases another solo project sometime."
3,Justin & Britney Secrets Played Out to a Beat!,"The grooves on this record are fine, but what's really compelling is the thinly disguised drama of Justin and Britney playing out in the lyrics. What a tale! In one track it even seems that Justin is angry because Britney has bought new socks while he has no socks to wear. Why so much bitterness over socks?Many listeners are comparing Justin's sound to Michael Jackson, but the truth is the sound and feel of this album are much closer to Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdink. Like those legends, Justin's a clean cut crooner who wants to get funky but has trouble being really convincing. The Neptunes try hard as producers but only sporadically hit the heights of Jones and Humperdink."
4,I don't like N'Sync BUT I LOVE JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE,"I have to be completely honest; I am not an N'Sync fan at all. However I fell in love with Justin Timberlake and became a fan when he preformed ""Gone"" on the ""Amanda Lewis Show"" in 2001. I never care for the ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" or even worse ""Pop"", but ""Gone"" took it to a respectable level with me and caused me to pick up Justin's New Solo CD. I was absolutely blown away with the production of this lately product. This CD is HOT! I love the R & B dance tracks as well as the slow and mellow tempo.My Top Five Songs1) Like I Love You (Hot)2) Cry Me A River (Beyond Hot)3) Take It From Here (Nice & Mellow)4) Nothing Else5) Last NightThe only songs I have mix feeling are ""Rock Your Body"" and ""Let's Take A Ride"" I truly don't know if it's a keeper or not. Maybe someone who brought this CD can help me out with these two - Stay or Go? Otherwise than that it's worth picking up."
1,Spayed cats sound better than this!,"Justin you are jealous of all the attention Clay Aiken gets. You are not as hot as he is, but you too do have something in common. Sucky cds! Why don't you go wine about being sorry for the wardrobe malfunction and stop infecting the masses with your crap about Britney doing you wrong. If she cheated its because you weren't man enough for my girl Brit!"
5,One of my faves.,"I maybe an old fart but I have enjoyed this CD along with the Sexy Back album for years. He has great talent and is a savvy business man with a humble personality. He can really make good music and sounds. I also love Timberland that really make these albums/CD's. No I am not African/American but I know a good sound when I hear it. I have my husband loving it too. I'm not a big hip-hop fan/guru but these two CD's are great for the car/travel. Keeps me pumped up and awake. My favorite is ""what goes around come around"" on his Sexy Back CD. I love the ""cry me a River"" on this CD."
4,Justified,"When I purchased this CD the day after it's release, I was afraid I wouldn't like it. After all, the only song I'd heard was ""Like I Love You""...which happens to be my favorite! I was really surprised at how great the rest of the album was! There were only 2 songs that I didn't care for...""Take It From Here"" and ""Nothin' Else"". If your thinking about buying this album, great choice! I love you Justin!!! :-)"
4,JTs Cd,"There are alot of hot songs on this cd. I dont like any ballads or slow songs but the upbeat ones kick ass, Both him and JC sound so much better solo and should keep it that way. I was very surprised its a great cd ROCK ON JUSTIN"
3,Oh Justin my dear...,"After seeing a teen-pop Star like Justin doing a R&B/hip-hop album, I can surely say that I HAVE SEEN IT ALL. Sure, the songs are good and danceable (Timbaland and Neptunes rarely fail) and he can sing but the album sometimes is boring and pointless. I like Justin, I think he's a nice guy but I expected something more original from him."
4,Almost Perfect,"Justin does great with this CD. i have heard that this cd sounds like another *NSYNC, but once i got the CD i knew that wasn't true. It is hot and not *NSYNC. There is one problem, though- it is definatley a Michael Jackson. He sings like MJ without trying, you can tell. Not all of the songs on the album are MJ copies, for example CRY ME A RIVER is great and individual. Keep it up, Justin, but maybe listen to your tracks after you sing them and see how much you sound like MJ."
2,this is one bad cd! (bad meaning lousy),"Am I the only one that thinks this cd is boring? Like I Love You is awesome, Cry Me a River is interesting, Rock Your Body is enjoyable, but the rest..really it's not that great. Someone please get him back with Max Martin."
2,trying WAY too hard,"OK... Justin just jumped on the R&B;/hip-hop bandwagon... This CD is just one more Timbaland and Neptunes production. There's nothing special about it. I really don't understand all the hype.Besides, he's trying WAY too hard......"
4,Nice Solo Effort,"This CD is a fairly good solo effort by Justin. He experiments with a lot of unusual beats and sounds. Its different that the usual *Nsync sound. I've listened to this CD a couple times and i like it pretty well. I think that i might like it even more if i keep listening to it thought. Justin's songs are one that sound messed up at first but they really grow on you. My favorite songs are Like, I love you, and Senorita. His songs are pretty catchy. Some people say that he is trying to copy Michael Jackson but i disagree. Even though i like this cd, i still like Justin with *Nsync better because they harmonize so well. I would recommend any nsync cd over this one , even though this one is pretty good"
2,I am just not convinced he is an R&B Hip Hop Type,"I wrote my original review on the day the album came out. I had listened to it once through. I had originally given it 3 out of 5 stars. Now, after more days of listening to it, the album has gone down even more.....down to 2 stars. The only good songs are CRY ME A RIVER, ROCK YOUR BODY and NEVER AGAIN. Even LIKE I LOVE YOU is getting on my nerves. Justin has a great voice but not in this style.....better luck next time!"
4,Just Like GTA is that bad?,"So many of the game reviews are picky. One of the biggest complaints about this game has been that it is the same old thing. Just like Grand Theft Auto. WHen was being like one of what is considered one of the best games ever been a bad thing? That said, if you don't like violence or profanity, avoid this game at all costs. It has both in spades. The game is very similar to the whole GTA vibe. Lots of free roaming action, lots of violence to innocent people, lots of what people loved from GTA. YOu can get more details from other reviews. The truth is if you are a churchgoer, avoid this game, it will do nothing to improve your spirituality. If you love GTA you love this game."
2,Pretty Much WORTHLESS..,"True Crime New York....I actually just rented it tonight, played it for 30 minutes, and repeatedly said the phrase ""this is gay"". For everyone that found ""streets of L.A."" to be a pretty decent experience probably will not like this crap. From the get-go, it feels solid and very intense, possibly worth the time. My mind soon changed when I got into the game. I know it's New York and traffic jams are common, BUT COME ON!! You can barely run without smacking against a friggin car!! I mean I realize 'L.A.' had it's fair share of bugs to make it not great, but this is just lame. I am by no means a Grand Theft Auto fan at all, but they completely stole the concept from San Andreas and threw a new name onto it. that's all I have to say. Depending on your preferences it may be worth a rent, but i strongly urge you to not spend your cash on this pile."
3,DO NOT PAY MORE THAN $5 FOR THIS PAMPLET,"Extremely thin PAMPLET, NOT the detailed book you would expect. Interesting reading, but you can find everything it has to say on the net with a simple search. Don't waste your money."
3,For dry skin,"Please note: this is for really dry skin. It has a great texture - nice and creamy. A wonderful scent too. But I have oily, blemish prone skin and this product adds a layer of moisture to your skin, so after washing my face my skin felt greasy, not clean."
5,My 5 yr old LOVES this!,She wanted a guitar for her b-day and she loves it! She plays and sings songs to us and lullabies to her little brother. It is so cute and I would recommend this guitar to any little girl!
2,It's ok,"I should have bought in the stores, it's cheaper and I wasn't a fan of the soft black. I like very black, thick lashes so this is only a good fit for someone wanting to do a simple daytime look. The mascara doesn't stay on long and my lashes feel oily with it on."
2,What was Garmin thinking?,"This case came with my c550 StreetPilot and while the GPS unit is quite good, the case design is flawed. The case is a neoprene-like material that hold the c550 snugly, with padding on the front side to protect the screen. The back side has a hole that exposes the socket on the back of the unit.Apparently, Garmin engineers thought it would be a good idea to leave the case on the unit when you have it attached to your windshield or other area of your dash. By doing this, the case flops around and the whole setup looks horrible.Yes, I do use the case, but I take the unit out of the case first then place it on the ball mount. A simple cut along one side of the case would allow users to slide it off the unit without removing the unit from the mount.This case was either an afterthought or it's just a poorly designed product."
1,WARNING-NOT A CARYYING CASE,The photograph for this product is incorrect. This is just the protective cover that only goes around the unit itself and is included with your purchase of your street pilot. You need to look at:Garmin Deluxe Carrying Case for StreetPilot and GPSMap 176 (010-10231-01) systemsInstead...
5,EXCELLENT READ,"MS WILLIAMSON HAD A SLOW START BUT WARMED UP VERY QUICKLY. SHE GAVE A LOT OF INSIGHT ON GETTING OVER PAST HURTS AND BECOMING WHO YOU REALLY ARE. THANKS TO HER, I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PREPARE FOR A RELATIONSHIP BEFORE I ACTUALLY HAVE ONE (I'VE BEEN DIVORCED 3 TIMES). I EXPERIENCED A VERY DEEP SENSE OF SERENITY THROUGH HER STRONG BUT GENTLE SPIRIT.I HAVE ANOTHER OF HER BOOKS ON THE WAY AND CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT ARRIVES.DON'T LIKE BOOKS ON AUDIO SO I RETURNED THE CD IN EXCHANGE FOR THE BOOK.THANKSMOLLIE ARCHER237 NOONDAY CHURCH ROADTWIN CITY GA 30471478-237-0933"
4,Wonderfully stated insight into the loving human heart,"This book came on strict recommendation from a dear and trusted friend who is a voracious reader of anything spiritual. She gives me very few highly recommended titles, but this one she had no doubt about --- BUY IT AND GET YOUR HILIGHTERS OUT! It is a simply put, beautifully expressed vision of the ways in which love, romance, dreams of forever, and the challenges of partnerships are faced by women. We tend to take on ""roles"" in our love lives, and Ms. Williamson captures the roles in such a way that you will find yourself within her words. I was so engrossed with the very first half I could barely put it down. It helps to know when you are reading that if your partner is willing to open up in the ways the book describes, you are both in for a wonderful journey into the spiritual side of love. If only one of you is aware of the need for change, it will be a very different, if not somewhat empty, journey alone."
1,Only MW Fans will like this one!,"Only fans of Marianne's work would like this book. The ""stream of consciousness"" style is irritating. If an author has something to say, then why not state it plainly? Granted, prayers often have an improvisational quality, but an entire book of prayers mixed in with the author's own stream of consciousness ""insights"" leaves me wondering if this work was completed just to complete another book, or if there was inspiration behind the rhetoric. Some of the male-female ""relationship"" ideas were also a bit curious. I wouldn't think that an enlightened woman would feel she needed to keep a man interested by playing ""games"" rather than attempting honest and straightforward communication....Have the ideals of the 60's women's movement disappeared in the 90's woman? From reading this book, you would think so."
4,Enchanted Love: TheMystical Power of Intimate Relationships.,"Ms.Willamson is going to take a lot of heat for this book. First of all, people have a tendancy to lean toward the familar. Gone is the benevolent, spritual face with the modest shoulder length hair that she had on the cover of A Return To Love, in it's place we see a retro '80's Pat Benetar look on the cover of Enchanted. Her prose is beautiful, even metaphysical, at times. But, there are times when her musings are downright sexist. The lady that said a relationship should'nt be based on the size of a wallet now says she needs to cared for like a ""Mercedes"" or a ""Jaguar"". One thing is for sure. This book will seperate the men from the boys, and, the girls from the women, because you're either love this book unconditionally or you're going to hate it immensely."
4,I think they missed the point...,"Oh, you silly willies! She says in the introduction that ""ENCHANTED LOVE"" is a collection of prayers, meditations, and little more than her own impressions about love - it's not a ""book"" in any sense of the word at all - and she didn't mean it to be. It's instead sort of an intimate evening at home discussing romantic love with Marianne. She's just sort of free-associating at times - and if this works for you, great! If not, well, there are plenty of ""how to"" books out there. This is a great book, if you're willing to ""forget logic. Forget your head. Open your heart, and come with me,"" as she writes in the frontispiece. And I think the dedication is VERY classy!"
1,this book doesn't make any sense.,"this book makes no sense. it is just stream of consciousness. I'm not sure how one is supposed to access the ""advice"" or information."
1,A Return to Love far Surpasses this Latest Effort,I am beginning to wonder if this author and Donald Neale Walsch have something in common. They don't know when to stop and leave a prior miracle a miracle. I am very disappointed with this book by Marianne. It is like she didn't write anything new that hasn't already been written by her and written much more clearly in her first A Return to Love. This seems much more like her capitalizing on her reputation and duping those of us who truly thought she might have something NEW to say. A money making venture for her and a major disappointment for me. It appears to me it would have been much more honest of her to re-release A Return to Love than to dupe us with bits and pieces of already published work.
2,Maybe you need to be a female......,"Although there are some clear sighted ideas here, most of the approach is from a woman's point of view...and a romantic woman at that. I found the book had no true mystical foundation but rather a sentimental one. I'm sure it will appeal to day dreamers and those who watch soap operas and read poorly written romance novels.In general I found the book lacks substance, backbone, balls and vitality."
1,THOSE THAT CAN NOT DO - TEACH,Marianne has never had a committed relationship in her life that has lasted more than a few months. That says it all.
2,Not sure where she was going with this one.,"I run a site dedicated to love. Marianne Williamson has always been a favorite. I Loved ""A Return to Love"" but this one left me wondering what she is really saying. Sorry I was left feeling confused."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"For someone who is often referred to as a ""new-age"" sensation, Marianne Williamson disappoints truly enlightened readers with her stale prose and highly traditional views on male-female relationships. This book puts a seemingly new-age spin on old-fashioned beliefs, namely that men need some enticement to remain interested in their ""woman"" and in maintaining a monogamous relationship. Although I enjoyed some of Marianne's early books, this one is a big disappointment!"
2,What was the point of this book?,"""Enchanted Love"" lacks clarity. She was so entangled in her flowery expression of words that she must have forgotten the point she was trying to make. This book is confusing more than it is enlightening.In the book she talked about the difference between men and women. How men usually don't lie, unless women proves we're hysterical in the light of truth. Hello! Since when are we responsible for how others behave? If that is the case, women definitely need to do the ""right"" thing to get men to behave the ""right"" way. It sounds like manipulation, but she calls it a dance.The two stars are for the prayers in the book. It's about the only part that is worth reading. I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste their time on this book. If anyone wants to read about love, I'd recommend Deepak Chopra's ""The Path To Love"", or Iyanla Vanzant's ""In The Meantime""."
1,Too Fragile,I have purchased eight Tracy Porter Artesian products.They are quite beautiful...when they arrive in one piece.Of the eight packages I have received via UPS only three have arrived unbroken.It's a shame because the pattern is very pretty but the quality of this china is very very poor.
2,"Beautiful, buts chips easily.","I love the colors and patterns, but this stoneware/pottery chips so easily, that you really have to handle it very carefully. My italian handpainted dishes are much more durable, and have lasted for years, but TP pieces have only worked 2-3 years, before chipping everywhere!"
4,A most extraordinary story. Fascinating reading.,The two earlier reviews say it all. REVIEWERS NOTE I would like very much to contact either of the reviewers for further information on the book and the author.
5,Good dictionary,"It's a good dictionary. I wouldn't trust it to be 100% accurate, but hey, what is? Definitely worth getting one, though. It's got a lot of good stuff in it that is interesting and worth knowing."
2,Smith's Bible Dictionary,I downloaded this to my Ipod touch and all the functions do not work I can't search by topic or my verse. Will not let me do any search I have to just slide to next page. If yo have an Ipod it is not worth the $2.00 inles you don't mind it not working like it should.God bless
2,Smith's Bible Dictionary,This book was not at all what I had hoped it would be. It does not contain all relevant biblical words that I need for my study.
2,needs improvement,Having taught Kindergarten for 9 years I can say that this video is cute but not as good as previous Leap Frog videos. The Letter Factory is a much better presentation of the letters with emphasis on letter sounds (needed to learn to read) vs. letter names. If you buy only one leap frog video I would recommend the Letter Factory video.
3,"Good, But a Bit Disappointing","I was delighted to find this and other Leap Frog videos available on instant play from **the popular DVD rental/streaming video company** to which we subscribe. My 4.5 yr. old and I watched The Amazing Alphabet Amusement Park today and I found the video to be disappointing. As an elementary teacher, I have to say that the original Letter Factory is so much more effective for teaching letters/sounds. The most disappointing part of this video was that it doesn't teach letter sounds at all. It basically teaches two skills: letter recognition and rhyming. On a positive note, I thought the video did a good job of pointing out differences in letters that look similar (such as ""i"" and ""j""). They also effectively presented both uppercase and lowercase letters simultaneously. Overall, this is a decent video for toddlers and younger preschoolers. But, if you're looking to make a purchase, I recommend buying the Letter Factory instead of this one."
2,Not as good as The Letter Factory,"I was so excited to buy this at the store when it first came out. We already own ""The Letter Factory"" and ""The Talking Words Factory"", but we had never seen this one, ""The Amazing Alphabet"" before. Oh my gosh, what a disappointment. Please don't waste your money on this one! This definitely goes into the category of ""edutainment"", meaning that there is too much cartoon and not enough learning. (On a side note, the music from this video sounds a little bit like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"".)"
4,My four-year-old really likes this!,"My daughter who is four really likes this series, including this episode at the amusement park. The audio can be slightly annoying for me but they are really teaching the children a lot with these videos. It is for young kids but it isn't babyish. I recommend this one for children 3-6, who are just on the verge of reading or who are very beginning readers."
5,Love it!,My girls are 2 and 4 and can't get enough of the Leap Frog learning. I have seen a huge increase in their vocabulary and knowledge of letters. Thank you so much!!
3,Somewhat boring,"This DVD doesn't do so much for the alphabet as Letter Factory or Phonics Farm. All it pretty much does is show the 2 frogs matching up the letters to start rides and sings "" Big A, Little A and Big B, Little b and ect. "" Didn't entertain my 2 1/2 year old as much as the other 2 mentioned did."
2,Travel book,This book was more of a travel guide through scandinavia than a cookbook and that was a bit of a disappointment for me.
5,"Excellent Recordings, Especially the Bruch.","I was indecisive as to whether I should go for the Decca Legends CD, also with Chung; or, rather, this one; or one other Decca CD that included ONLY (see below) the Violin 1 and the Scottish Fantasy.That last was the first to fall off, as it did not include the Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64 by Felix Mendelssohn, which featured on the Decca Legends. This reading with as conductor Tennstedt sounds fine to me ... certainly it must be one of the staples of Bruch 1st Violin Concertos? Probably 'better' than the one recording with Kempe conducting (no blame on him).But that last contains the very fine Mendelssohn. So, in conclusion, you'd do best ending up acquiring both this Tennstedt and the Decca Legends CD."
3,Not as good as Hilary Hahn,"This CD was enjoyable and totally enlightening.It featured Kyung-Wha Chung and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra for the Beethoven concerto.BUT, on comparison with Hilary Hahn and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, it doesn't even come close.Of note, the Beethoven violin concerto is accompanied by Bruch No. 1 by the London Philharmonic which is well done and shows the expertise and virtuosity of Chung. This may be the only CD where the Bruch is available. (The Hilary Hahn version is accompanied by Leonard Bernstein's Serenade.)If you choose this one over the BSO version, it will be totally on PRICE and availability over the Marketplace."
3,Average,"Love the look but the construction is questionable. Over time, these lamps wobble and cannot seem to be tightened. Not the best value for the money."
2,So So...,"This book had some good points, but in a whole it was pretty boring. It did not have the secrets I was looking for. I wanted the real insite. This book took me through a roll palying game with a man and wife. There situation was not similiar to mine, so it made it hard to read. Not bad for the price, but I bet there is better."
1,Good luck finding replacement bags!,"Now, I like this vacuum. It's pretty well designed, it's lightweight, and it really has AMAZING power. It's a little chintzy -- a part broke off in shipment -- but I think it's worth the money.Here's the problem, though: no real store sells replacement bags. I've found exactly three companies online that sell replacements, and I ordered from all of them. Somewhere between a day and two months later, though, they all emailed back and said they couldn't get the bags. (Oh, and by the way -- even if they COULD get them, with shipping it would cost roughly twenty dollars for TEN bags.)In short, then, I'm stuck. I wish somebody had warned me about this before I bought the vacuum. Now I'm warning you."
1,World's First Disposable Vacuum? No Bags!,"This vacuum is nicely designed and works well. Too bad that the vacuum bags are not available in the U.S. I have had them on order from AllergyBeGone and Delonghi-Sales since December, and they have no ETA. Shame on Delonghi, and shame on Amazon for selling an item that cannot be used."
2,Motor dead after a dozen uses,"Bought this in June, 2005. Since our house has built-in central vaccuum already, the unit was used sparingly to clean my daughter's apartment. She's a traveling consultant working in Philly but living in Denver. The vaccuum is light and powerful - it was a breeze to clean her 500 square-foot apartment. However, it was used less than a dozen times when apparently the motor went dead. The authorized service center said the unit is not under warranty according to its serial number and would cost $150 to repair. But it was shipped June 23, 2005 from Amazon and broke down Thanksgiving Day, 2005! It worked well while it lasted..."
1,Real Pilots Fly Planes That.................................................................,"The sequel sticker will read: Real pilots only fly planes that suffer from uncommanded rudder deflections, cargo bay doors that detach in flight, unexplained mid air breakups, and DC-10s."
5,FANTASTIC SOUND QUALITY,With all the bootlegs of Frank Marino listed here on Amazon it's nice to see a proper and legit release that sounds GREAT!!The remastering here is top notch and song selection is well thought out...these Guitar Hero releases from Zzounds are all excellent!!
4,A very nice necklace!!,"This was a really nice piece and made a lovely gift for a family member.Shipping was also very fast and they communicate well.Also please note I gave this to a beautiful older woman who very much appreciated it and was immediatly told by her 21 year old daughter that she would be borrowing it often.Point: Enjoyed by all ages.My only complaint was that there was no box, it came in a plastic bag and I had ordered about 15 pieces that I needed to get boxes for very quickly.Other than that I would HIGHLY reccommend this seller and this piece."
2,Not Quite as Nice as Image,"The image really looks much better than the actual product. Stones are quite brownish, not red as one would expect of garnet. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this."
5,"Very cute, easy to apply","We ordered this border for our nursery. It was very easy to apply and was the perfect pattern. One thing to keep in mind -- if you want to match the pattern the whole way around, you may have to cut a few inches (6 - 12) off of each roll before you start applying it, so order accordingly."
5,Best album to hallucinate to... ever!,"The first disk of this set is amazing. It thumps at about 160 bpm and the sounds are so rich. Every track is a winner. This is the ideal album to ""open your third eye"" to, if you know what I'm saying. It's also great to drive along to, but it's hard to keep from speeding. Also ideal for a full-on rave. The best from the Goa Head series."
2,Dreadful book,"While Tisdale has some wonderful things to say about the way we satisfy our hunger, it's difficult to make it past the way she says it.The text is overwrought and banal, as though the author wanted desperately each paragraph to be beautiful and perfect for quoting in a review. Please believe other reviewers when they call this book pedantic and recommend that Ms. Tisdale find herself a better editor.Once you've plowed through this book, I can't imagine that you'll put yourself through it again. Borrow it from the library, or, at least, don't pay full price."
1,"Wretched, pedantic and boring as heck","Tisdale is a hack at best and nothing she writes has much to do with life in general. She writes as if she's bothered with the process, less a critic and more a condescending harridan with a lot of words at her disposal. She certainly needs an editor but from what I gather, she's too difficult to be bothered. Bullheaded, opinionated and obstinate..she is definitely a bore. I would recommend any other book about food except this one. She should stick with what she thinks she knows: pretending to be a bisexual and being a bad parent."
1,One Long Whine,"Frankly, I gave up a third of the way through. The author sneers at American food, American food tastes, and American versions of ethnic food. Boy, has she got attitude!"
1,This book leaves a bitter sour taste.,"I was disappointed.I was looking forward to be informed and entertained about food, in a fond and celebrative way as implied by the title. Perish the thought! Although the contents and insights are worthy and well researched, it is also preachy and constantly harks back to the ""good ole days"". Worse, it has a patronising attitude about American food habits / culture and a paranoid view, e.g. in chapter about white flour, a conspiracy theory about how consumers have been manipulated by the industry, well and good if she has a lively captivating style of writing. Instead, the overall impression is dry, dreary and remote; I gave up after reading a third of it."
2,Dreary and lonely,"Instead of being a charming food memoir, Tisdale takes the reader on a dreary deathmarch through her own unending guilt over her abandonment of her glorious hippie co-op past. One gets the feeling that all of the lights in her emotional life have been dimmed by the overhanging cloud of her loneliness for those brown rice and tofu days. I wanted to stop half way through, but came upon one of the only nuggets of intriguing and insightful writing where she discusses her own relationship to food and dieting. Encouraged, I pressed on, but now wish I hadn't so that I could have been spared her assault on every cook from James Beard to Julia Child to anyone who might dare cook anything without spelt and unpasteurized Portland goat milk!"
4,Get your bleedin' skates on,"I'm not sure which is more fun: reading the book, reading her blog or meeting ""Melicioius"".This is a slammin book and I loved it."
5,Loved It!!,I loved this book!! I could not put it down! I loved it so much that got my book club to read it and they loved it too (even though I'm the only one who plays roller derby). I would highly recommend it to anybody who is into roller derby.
4,Totally awesome tales from the track ....,"Any roller derby gal starting a league or joining a league should get ahold of this book - and roller derby enthusiasts should be just as intrigued. Melicious from the Texas Rollergirls (flat track association) tells her roller derby saga - from watching her first bout, to joining the Bad Girls Good Woman league to the split in factions and subsequent formation of the Texas Rollergirls and Texas Lonestar Roller Derby Girls. Anyone interested in the Woman's Flat Track Roller Derby Association (WFTDA) could also benefit from this book, as it tells the tale of how the whole dang flat track revolution started. An easy read from front to back, Rollergirl Totally True Tales From the Track, was worth every penny."
5,This book ROCKS,"Not only does this book explain the neat history of derby and the even neater story of the author's rise to derby stardom, it gives the reader a wicked personal boost. Melicious' positive attitude is refreshing and infectious. It's high time we have a strong, smart, and savvy role model who proves that women of all ages and all backgrounds can excel both on and off the track. The perfect gift for your friends, moms, kids, etc."
5,"A fun, interesting read!","This book was so hard to put down that I read it in one day. It explained the inner workings of derby and motivated me to skate even faster and hit even harder!-Madame Switchblade #75Rogue Rollergirls, Fayetteville, NC"
2,Strong opener...,"... and then it kindof goes nowhere terribly interesting.I should probably have read a few more reviews before getting this one. A quick flip through would have revealed that most of the five star ratings come from fellow Derby skaters and fans, and, sure, I can see how this would be a great read for them.But once the successful formation of the new league has been covered, the book wallows around in mundane details that weren't really of very much interest to the average civilian. Pre-game playlists? Favorite rollergirl names? Different personae? Eh.This ain't Friday Night Lights. More's the pity."
3,A fun look at the rebirth of an old sport played in a new way.,"Rollergirl: Totally True Tales from the Track, is an entertaining inside look into the new roller derby revolution from the skater's point of view. It is a raw and unpolished book that gets a bit racy at times. It is obviously riding on the success of the A&E TV series ""Rollergirls"". The book successfully maintains the tone of the popular series. Another facet of its success comes from the dearth of current books about one of the fastest growing phenomenons in sports today. All the Roller Derby skaters and fans will read this book. They will get a straight forward in your face account of events a seen by the author. I don't know how many people outside of the Roller Derby world will enjoy it. Read it or not, everyone should attend at least one roller derby bout in their life. They won't forget it."
5,HOLY S**T!!!!,"I saw this band back in September at a club called the Parkside in San Francisco not knowing what to expect. The band completely laid waste to the club with one of the most untamed performances I've ever witnessed. The singer was a bloody mess by the end of the night. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this debut album, but I feared that there was probably no way they could equal the wild din they created live. Well, my fears were washed away within seconds of putting this in my CD player. Raw, primitive and insanely aggressive. This is an album that wants to chew you up and spit you out. Much to my surprise, there are actually a few poppy velvet-esque songs peppered throughout that are very well written. If you don't have a taste for the noisy stuff then you'd best stay away, but if you like your rock n' roll crude and in your face then this thing delivers in spades."
4,BECKY LEBEAU IS FINE!,"Great movie! I especially love the scene where the beautifulBecky LeBeau gets completely naked and starts humping thatalligator float. It doesn't get much hotter than this andit's a scene you will want to watch over and over again,I know i have! Great acting from everybody in the movie,even if the plot is rather uneventful and pointless.If you're a fan of those typical 80's movies, thisis one you have to see, especially that scene withBecky LeBeau. Believe me, you won't be dissapointed!In conclusion, I hope that my review has helped you andthat more people will see this movie and write about it."
1,Not very dramatic,"I just renovated my kitchen. The full nine-yards - granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances and I wanted a nice piece of functional art that would be a conversational piece. So I bought this rolling pin holder. However, when it arrived, it was small and looked like I made it with left-over bent metal. I probably will not use this on the wall in the kitchen anymore, as it is a very boring, ordinary design. If you picture this without the rolling pin, it is just two bent pieces of metal. Not worth the money or time that I had to spend buying this."
5,rolling pin display rack,"I ordered 4 of these to display antique rolling pins. The racks easily hood together with a hook you can't see in the picture. It is hidden by the pin. They are beautiful and functional. These are items that you will pass down through generations of rolling pin lovers along with the special rolling pins. The racks are made of cast iron, with the simple swirl design. The part that holds the pin is curved out from the wall. I have one very large pin, long and with a 3.5"" barrell that would not fit on the rack. It can be altered and then my prize pin will be on the wall with the others. This is a collectors item. Proudly made by the Amish in the USA."
5,"Man, Oh Man","This is the first album that I have taken the time to write a review for, and I can only give one reason for it: Stop All the World Now is simply the best Album I have bought in a long, long time.I can't describe how good it is. There could be simple comparisons to David Gray, or other songwriters, but comparisons don't tell how artful Stop All the World Now really is. Sure, there are a couple of times when the use of processed sounds just doesn't seem right, but dammit, its still good music.What most bands would need a full album full of screams to accomplish is simply summed up into a simple chorus by Howie. He uses restraint to keep from taxing the listener, and does so in a way that keeps one reaching for the repeat button. Listening to ""Perfect Time of Day"" once is almost impossible. In Fact, its hard to listen to this album all the way through without skipping back.Quite Frankly, I want this album to be playing in the background of all the events I want to remember in 20 years."
5,simply awesome,If you are recent fan and merely like/know Howie Day for Collide then you cannot truly appreciate his music. Take some time and explore his music over the past several years and see how he and his music have developed. Check out some recordings of his concerts throughout his career (that's where the real magic is) and then take a listen to this album. SATWN is another incredible release from Howie.
3,Okay,"Except for the pretty song ""Collide,"" the album is generally boring and so-so. Except for two other songs - and they aren't even that radio-friendly - there is nothing standout, and after one listen I was ready to put in a different CD. It's a nice background CD, quite mellow to listen to while doing something else... otherwise not a road-trip, sing-along, stick-in-your-head (or stereo, for that matter) album. You'll get bored with it quickly. Sorry Howie - but ""Collide"" almost makes up for the rest of it though!!"
1,Written by non-technically knowledge authors,"Never before have I been so disappointed with a product that I felt compelled to go out of my way to write a complaint, until now. I total agree with the with the prior, and then some. This book was clearly written by amateurs that did nothing more than plagiarized technical information from the manufactures technical information.A simple search on the Internet will not only provide you with more information but it will be of far greater quality. Not only should Amazon.com discontinue this product caring this product but also the printer manufacturers should investigate the authors for copyright infringements.I only regret that I didn't discover this review before I wasted my money and purchased this book."
4,Anything Tori is good!,"Any Tori amos fan knows that she is simply amazing. After getting this CD from a friend for my birthday It really helped me to understand the power and amazing qualities Tori has. It's also nice, because I personally hardly see Tori on TV interviews and listening to her on CD is a good substitute. Buy her CD's first (esp. Under the Pink/Boys for pele) and when you become devoted, pick up her interview CD's!"
1,wasted pages,"The title promised an inside look and stoveside excursion into the heart of Africa. Two entire pages devoted to ""How to Boil Corn"" caused me to throw this dog out with grabage. Regretful purchase....."
1,Don't waste your time or money,What a waste of time this book is! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for any reason. Save your money.
4,Not a bad book,"i have enjoyed making recipes from and just reading this book. i almost always make the ""curried corn"" for potlucks and i have seen people eat it warm, room temp and even cold, with tortilla chips or spread on bread. i have used it as a relish for fish tacos, as well. the reviewer who tossed hers out as ""grabage"" (maybe she should have bought a dictionary, instead) may not have enjoyed the idea of an informational-type cookbook, but i appreciate the short history on the recipes and ingredients and it will continue to be used in my kitchen."
2,"Great idea, laughable recipes","I read through this book for fun. As an African, many of the recipes have, well, quite obviously not been made by the author but instead garnered from others, errors and all. Which is why she suggests that Nigerians make eba with palm oil... ah. no, no they don't... I doubt they actually incorporate the oil into cassava... not sure how that would work... these and other little quirks made the book funny in a laughable kind of way, but not practical... or accurate really. I do appreciate the idea, and hope a real African who has lived on the continent can make a good cookbook showing different recipes from all over the continent (as herculean a task as that would be) Also, lots of typos... not sure how that's possible in a cookbook...but it happened. Long story short, this is a good book to impress your friends with if you're not African and want to show how diverse your interests are. If you are African, this is a good book to have a laugh at with other Africans."
4,intro to African food,"The book is a nice introduction to African cooking with hard to find senegalese recipes. However, the ethiopian selection is ridiculous, there are so many wonderful possibilites and yet she chose to include a recipe for raw beef with instructions that make it clear she knew very few if any readers would actually want to make this dish. That I found very disappointing."
3,My can didn't really work,This is my 2nd time using his product and the can I received most have been sitting out for too long. From shaking the can I can tell the contents inside seems to be separated. My 1st experience work as expected. Lesson: shake before you buy!
3,CRAZY NAME EXCELLENT PRODUCT,Great product. Better than WD40 by far. Pretty much performs as claimed. Made my 10' sliding pocket doors work 50% better. Highly recommend.
3,"Not Bad, but not the Best","I just read the previous posters response and it seemed like he copied the words right out of Unwrapped #2 liner notes.I found that the Rock the Boat, Always on Time as well as After Party's version was excellent.The others were ""ok"", however i wouldn't considered them ""copycat""."
4,Great !! Not a Must Get Though,"I bought this album because of the awesome remake of Aaliyah's Rock the Boat which they did a fantastic job of.They also did a great job with ""After Party"" and ""You Don't Have to Call"".In a nutshell, not as good as Hidden Beach's Unwrapped, but I would get it."
1,"no,no,no,no,no,no,NO!!!","simply put, fans of maysa and kym waters and all the 'sounds' that they expound upon, go out and get this!!! yall will love it... this is the epitome of the true sound of the style that some folks call 'smooth' jazz...but alas...this is not for me!!!i'm not hating on the talent of the folks involved in smooth jazz, because they are highly skilled... this is just boring and unappealing to me, mostly because i am a fan of the original songs played here and some sad-justice is being done with these interpretations!!!"
2,Listening for an echo,"The sound quality of this movie was very poor. I wish I could get my money back. The movie itself was not too bad, however I did not like Armand Assante in the lead role."
4,Doo Wop Magic,"It's a little hokey, but if you're a doo wop fan like me, you'll love this movie. Kenny Vance and the Planotones, who are gifted entertainers if you have ever seen them in person, do the actual singing for the actors."
2,Not what my dad was looking for,"Bad acting, b rated movie and not the storyline we thought it was going to totally follow. Similar to it, though."
3,A MUSICAL TRIP BACK TO THE 60S,"A VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE, GOOD ACTING, GREAT SCENES OF NYC AND EXCELLENT SOUND TRACK. A PLEASANT WAY TO SPEND AN EVENING!!"
3,depressing,"The movie was slow and boring. I was sorry I bought it. Very lame story line, not worth reading it."
5,A stellar performance!!!!,"I am soooooo happy that I opted to purchase this book. Not only was the story fascinating and at times sad, it gave me a huge perspective on Ozzy's behavior and what makes him tick. The photo bonus in the middle of the book is a true treasure. It was so good, I read the whole thing from cover to cover in less than 3 hours! Definitely worth every penny spent!"
5,Really really works!,I have TWO Golden Retreivers and ONE that I dog sit for DAILY ... this product really works! No more hair bushes in the corners of my kitchen ... worth EVERY penny!
2,My dog has diarrhea after using it,"My dog is a Siberian husky. He had diarrhea after eating it as recommended amount. Tryed to redued the amount, but still had diarrhea. so had to stopped using it. Seems working though."
2,cheap is as cheap does,"I picked this up before heading to Europe. I chose it because it was inexpensive and I figured 'what the hell'. English is my only fluent language. This thing works, but you will go hungry if you try to understand/decode a restaurant menu. The display is small so that one must scroll character by character to see long words or phrases. Don't expect anything but textbook words. There is no phonetic help with pronunciation. I didn't use the address book, currency exchange, or functions other than word translations. After minimal use, the battery (included) started to fade.Bottom line: if you want to look up an occasional word, fine, go for it. If you think this will allow you to solve your language ignorance problems, move along."
2,Good only for the basics,"The translator lacks of plurals and genders. If you have not background at all of the foreign language (including pronunciation), this translator is not much help."
2,twe-1185,"It is not user freindly and very complicated. I am not happy with it. I even had help trying to decifer it. Bad investment. By the way I am 74 and computer literate, learned computers begining in 1970""s."
2,"OK for the money, but....","This product is very reasonably priced, however, it certainly does not measure up to the product description. In particular, the Euro converter did not work for me (or it was just to un-user friendly). Also many needed words and phrases were not found."
2,Just buy a phrase book,"Others on this site have recommended Rick Steve's phrasebooks, or Berlitz or Lonely planet and I'll buy one of these. I expected that I could type a sentence and get a translation. This is not the case. I could not change languages. The device got stuck in Spanish. I had to take a paper-clip and push the reset button to get it back to English (so carry a paper clip!).Others have said that the display is tiny and hard to read. Quite true. I was hoping for something lighter than a book, but I think you can search a book more quickly than you can scroll thru the tiny menus in this device.Based on reading I have done on Amazon -- the whole category of portable translators seems to be a dissapointment."
1,Inutile!,"This is the most useless piece of equipment I have ever encountered. Admittedly I have only tried its French translation feature. I gave up with it some time ago but decided to give it one more try yesterday, needing occasional translation while reading the excellent 'Parisians' book. Even words in common usage such as 'tant' and 'marais' could not be found. Some years ago I had a small inexpensive Franklin translator that was excellent with this piece of kit Franklin have definately gone backwards. A few months ago I sent an email to Franklin expressing my disappointment with this device but no response was ever received."
1,Franklin Translator:5 European Languages,"I was extremely disaponted with this product. I had previously owned a 5 language translator (TWE 106B) and expected the new one to be as good or better. Instead, it was vastly inferior; extremely difficult to move fron one lanaguage to another. Were it possible and cost effective to do so, I would be glad to return it."
3,Not completely without value,"My daughter's Spanish teacher recommended a translator for his class. We were somewhat disappointed in the ease of use and how clumsy this translator is. It was ok for simple translations, but really was not a lot of help in learning the Spanish language. It seemed like it would help you find a bathroom or order lunch in a foreign country, but her classmates had much better, much easier to use translators. She gave up using this one after just a couple of weeks."
1,Not a Vampire Movie...,I normally like even bad vampire movies. But this isn't one. Just a movie about a drug that makes people go mad and think they need to drink blood. Of course everyone wants to create a drug with that as a side effect!I didn't mind the acting of about 3 of the characters. The rest were beginners. Too often use of the fog machine. Had to have the typical required sex scenes but they were very subtle.Don't view it unless it is the only movie you have to pick from. Another $1.99 delete bin sale for me.
1,Generic,"Bad B-horror. Bad acting, bad FX, foggy picture, it has it all, stay clear, you have been warned"
5,GREAT TRUE STORIES,GREAT TRUE STORIESA magnificent compelling true life drama- what a gift- the REAL hospital from this passionate and compassionate story of lives worth emulating is athttp://www.lhospital.org/index_eng.htmIt is a joy to learn this place really exists. Lives really do count. Through just passing this at Block Buster- after one view I purchased the DVD...a story to inspire this is a good one to have in your library of great true stories.www.CONQUERESS.com
2,Could have been much better...,"Everything in the set is cute. However, when it arrives and you open it, everything is taped together with extremely strong tape. When you try to pull the tape off, it pulls the fabric on everything. Now the towel, bib, washcloth, etc. has little pull marks everywhere the tape was. It is very disappointing. This was a gift from a friend for my newborn and I feel bad she spent good money on such a shoddily put-together product."
2,Great Idea - only not sturdy enough for toddlers,"We purchased this piano for our 1&2 year old as a christmas present. It lasted three weeks and the legs of the bench broke off. The piano itself is also not very sturdy. They loved the piano, it just was not made sturdy enough to withstand the use of busy toddlers."
4,"Wonderful tune, tons of fun","My granddaughter has tons of fun with this piano, much to her mother's dismay! It does have a nice tune when its not being pounded on. But it can take alot of abuse and still sound great. That's the best thing about it.The most annoying thing about it is the unsturdy legs! We've only had it for about two years, and it seems as if the legs will fall off anyday now.The paint on the bench was easily scratched up as well.But overall, my granddaughter LOVES it, and that's enough for me!"
3,"In the days of the ""Gaze"" craze.....","I'm not sure who put this together, but it's a collection of ""shoegazer"" bands from the early 90's. Included are some bigger names such as ""Ride"", ""Slowdive"", and my favorite ""Lush"", as well as some obscure acts like ""Moose"", ""Drop Nineteens"", and ""Adorable"". There are a few genre-defining groups missing here, like ""Catherine Wheel"", ""Curve"", and ""MBV"", perhaps even ""Cocteau Twins"" and ""Jesus And Mary Chain"", but this is still a decent collection. Anyone looking for more of this sound should just check out any of the above mentioned bands."
2,Poor cross section of music . .,"These bands had so many better songs than the ones selected here. When I think shoegazer, I think a wonderful AM drone . . .and this just isn't it. The songs sound so much more like Ride's Twisterella era music than Nowhere. And the singing on many of the tracks is flat and off key."
3,"Nicely presented, but incomplete","The pictures are undoubtedly the best feature of this book: they're clear, bright, colorful, and most-importantly, helpful. The text and recipes are easy to understand, although not flawless; occasionally, they read like poorly-translated stereo instructions.However, the author has strangely neglected several of the most common types of sushi. There's absolutely no mention of fresh salmon (sake), yellowtail (hamachi), grilled eel (unagi), or even tobiko. Some of the more popular rolls in the USA, such as spicy tuna, California (crab & avocado), and spider (crab tempura) are also missing. A section on sashimi would've been nice as well, but no luck.Rice, the basic ingredient of any sushi, only gets three pages in the back, and they're all in black-and-white (unlike the glorious color photos used for everything else).In short, it's a nice presententation, but woefully incomplete."
3,"Huge learning curve, then fun","PS2 version.When I first started this game, I hated it. The controls were confusing and tricky as all get out. I don't know how many times I stood there stupidly grabbing at a suspect before being able to arrest them. Driving and steering were annoying; I kept accidentally getting out of a car when I meant to brake. It was far too easy to rack up ""bad cop"" points without even trying. But I stuck it out. And it got better.It was fun trying to clean up the neighborhoods. Good variety of side missions.The main story was okay, with a nice surprise ending. And one way to avoid those bad cop points is to avoid driving as much as possible. I took cabs everywhere and it worked out fine.All in all, I would recommend this game, if you have the patience to get past that learning curve."
4,Actually tons of fun!!!,"Other people have been complaining about this game, but I think it's actually a lot of fun. Most people don't like this game because of the first few minutes. I have to admit that the first 5 mins are pretty bad, but once you get to the streets, the game is a blast!!!I found myself driving around the streets of NY chasing random criminals and street racing for hours to the point where I forgot to follow the main storyline missions. Trying out the different ways you have to kill or arrest people is awesome!!!The city itself is jawdropping. The rain, the thunder, the ambient VO, the potholes on the road, and all the buildings that change appearance as you clean up the city make you feel that you're in the matrix or something.Get the game, ignore the first few minutes, and you'll see how much fun this game is!!!"
1,Should not have bought it!,I will get straight to the point.....the game freezes constantly...how did this game with all its glitches get released? I can't believe I spent money on this trash!
3,"1ST TRUE CRIME, IS A BETTER GAME","I DID NOT LIKE THE NY VERSION. IT MAKES NY LOOK LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A GODFATHER FILM. MIGHT BE BECAUSE I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN NY. SO, I MIGHT BE PARTIAL TO NOT ENJOYING THE GAME. THE CONTROLS ARE NOT GOOD WHILE DRIVING THE STREETS. THE LA VERSION I THINK HAD A BETTER STORY. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THE GAME IS THAT IT DOES LOOK LIKE NEW YORK CITY. IF YOU WANT A BETTER GAME SIMILAR TO THIS ONE, GET THE GODFATHER GAME. I KNOW IT'S VIOLENT ALSO, BUT THE CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE BIT BETTER, AND IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE FILMS, GET IT. THANK YOU"
2,Just not very good,"They improved the game a little from the last version -- there is still the lame good cop/bad cop aspect to it (which ruins the game for me). The main character runs like he's in quicksand. The handling of the cars is like driving a tank. I also hate what they did to my favorite city -- they doubled the number of lanes on each road, for example, in the West Village, they made every street a four-lane highway. I mean, it's just ridiculous --- to the developers: put away the map of NYC, and go back to LA where you think fighting dragons is ""true crime"". This game just blows (as further evidence, the game's been out a week and it's already being sold used on Amazon for $20 less than retail)."
2,Not much better than Streets of LA,I rented this game and I thought it was ok. The gunplay is the biggest dissapointment. The targeting reticles blow and the gunfights in the game are mediocore. Dissapointing sequel even though there's a large city it all looks the same. The things you do as a cop will get old fast and the driving is ok and the music isn't very good. It's a shame because i thought this game had potential. This series still needs lots of work.
4,Fabulous...,"Very few groups achieved the level of elegance,taste,and power that these legends exhibited on their 1985 record.There is a sense of freshness and sheer beauty in the voice of J.T.Taylor,weonderfully showcased by by the funky and,sometimes,jazzy orchestrations.Every track on this album means business,setting a standard for the genre."
1,Industry Propaganda,"The Center for Media and Democracy's PR Watch found that this book was authored by people working for the food industry. The book's authors are funded by Burger King, Coca Cola, DuPont, Exxon, Frito-Lay, General Mills and General Motors, to name a few. This book is and was a complete farce and that's why it costs 5 cents on amazon."
2,Could hardly wait to finish,"I was very excited with the character development in the first 150 pages, but was disappointed with the remainder of the novel. With over 700 pages it is hard to beleive that so little can happen."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"This is a novel about a love story and a hoped-for war of liberation. The oddity is that neither happens. The beginning and end are separated by hundreds of pages of christian drivel.Alas and alack there is no rescue from characterization. The author begins with a bright, curious, sensual young woman who 'adopts' a religious vocation as an escape from an unwanted marriage. The entire book evolves around her vocation, unbelievable though it is from the 'get-go', and how she 'chooses' it over the love of her life (a taste of which we are given in a very few pages at the end of the book).Our hero is more sympathetic yet more inept. He is unable to land the heroine, find someone else, or initiate his lifelong goal to liberate his country from invaders.One is left to ponder what Mr. Bragg had in mind."
1,incredulous,Sorry but I couldn't see the point of finishing this book when the only character I had any interest in was killed off one quarter of the way through. It was a struggle to get that far since I found everything so superficial. This is a great idea for a book but I felt Bragg was only scratching the surface.
1,"Very, very badly written","As badly written a book as I have ever encountered. I toiled through this dud because a good friend recommended it; now I doubt that friend had read it herself. Bragg puts a badly chosen modifier with nearly all his nouns - perhaps he wrote this at speed and put down whatever came into his head; surely this book had no editor. And we don't learn much about life or customs or important matters in 7th century northern England. Bragg needs a good critic: someone to tell him to shape up and learn to write decent prose, not the ponderous, inflated stuff in this book."
4,Good Herbal Reference,Dr. Mindell puts out a good book to add alongside his book on vitamins. This is one of the better herbs books.
1,Bad Themes,"On the heals of discovering the oh-so-wonderful Paper Bag Princess by Munch, I ordered several more of his books. BIG MISTAKE. Not all Munch is created equal. In this book, a child gets everything she wishes for for her birthday, including the pregnancy of her mother. NOT A GOOD MESSAGE. Willful child in charge of adults with no consequences. I bought this for my grandson and never showed it to him."
5,It's Great,"This is a combination of genius: band leader Herman, arranger Ralph Burns, and many very talented side musicians who create a thunderstorm of swinging gems, topped with the soft and subtle rain of an ""early autumn""!"
5,This is onn of the best bass albums ever!,There are so many wonderful tracks on this classic CD. Magic Mike is a wizard on the wheels and MC Madness provides catchy lyrics. This is a must have for those who love bass. A good system is a must to truly enjoy this masterpiece!!
3,Average but not great,This practice book is not as explanatory as I expected. I will not recommend it for people who don't have a very strong grammar background to use it.
2,Buyer beware!,"We bought this product about 14 months ago and installed it in our newly renovated kitchen about 10 months ago. When the microwave works, it's a good microwave -- works well, good looking, nice automatic sensors -- however, we've had some problems with it.The big problem for us (and this is a big problem) is that in the 10 months we've had it one of the three internal fuses shorted out on 3 different occasions. Now that it's out of it's 1-year warranty the price of fixing that fuse looks like its >$100. Also, this microwave is going to be tough to replace becasue we've built the cabinet opening custom for this microwave.I'm also going to complain to my kitchen designer and make sure that this appliance isn't going to be recommended to his other customers. Unreliable quality makes for an expensive appliance."
1,Decided to review while looking for a micro to replace this one!,"There are not many choices for ""over-the-counter"" models out there, I wanted to see reviews of other models because I have to replace this Sharp model which is finicky at best! When it is working, the ""Compu Cook"" is so complicated I have to pull out the manual. But a more serious problem is that the microwave turns on all by itself, so we have to keep a bowl of water in it to avoid a major catastrophe, and occasionally the appliance blows a fuse, I noticed another reviewer had the same problem with the fuse as well."
2,not a keeper,"We have a built in cabinet. This seems to be the only microwave that fits. The first Sharp microwave lasted about two years. It's replacement lasted 12 months and a few days; just long enough to be out of warranty. I may have to replace it with the same model because it seems to be the only model that fits the space. I have no complaints about how it funtions, just that it doesn't have a long life."
2,Expensive for what it is,"Ordered this premium-priced microwave, and perhaps I had too high an expectation. I was disappointed to find the product to be cheaply made -- mine had ""wrinkles"" on two of the sides -- and not worth the 3x price increase. It may function perfectly well as a microwave, as it's basically a simple, cheap, unit which has been put into a different case. If you get one that isn't flawed, then I suspect it'll look very smart when installed.Sharp seem to be the only company to do over-the-counter microwaves, so your choice is limited if you must have this style. I've gone for a more common counter model, and will spend the extra money on a shelf for it."
3,Short life,The sharp R-1214: I love the look but it only lasted 7 years and we operated it with broken display lights for over 4 years. Wish I had put a shelf in cupboard so I had more replacement options now.
3,so-so,The microwave is so-so. I expected more from Sharp. The price and service from Amazon is 5 stars.
3,Not too bad!,"This cd is good but I cant compare it with their early albums .There are also funky tracks on this album are well-blended with rap music.The point is why all people don't want JT anymore.Cant they see his excellent vocal range,and the success that he left with Kool & The Gang through the 80's.? People let's be realistic, I'm very pleased. What they say it doesnt matter He's a great man and I cant imagine Kool without JT in my opinion. Also theres another new album on it's way which will be released on October. Im still looking forward."
2,I THINK YOU ARE GETING OLD,"I THOUGH YOU GUY'S WOULD HELP YOUNG PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO LIKE FUNK AND SOUL TO KEEP IT ALIVE.BUT WHAT IS THIS MEN.You started taking the horn away jt,Mickens,curtis went then you started puting hard guitars.Men try to stay by one thing please.As the year's go on you are just producing bad things except the video's...."
1,what the hell is this,"first off i'm mad at amazon.com for not having a slot for 1/2 a star. Because this album is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is by far the worst commercially released album i have ever heard. did anyone even listen to it when they mixed and mastered it????? I'm not going into how great they were in the 70's or how good the songs were in the 80's...cause it would only cheapen the experience..I'm totally mortified by this album .look at bands like the roots, a group that uses the sound of early kool and the gang to ROCK shows.. TOTAL dissapointment. dont EVER make another album please...."
2,not as kool as it used to be,"There are a couple of good songs on here, but way too much hip hop. What happened to classy vocals backed by blazing horns? Yes, I miss JT on lead vocals. Chucki Booker (remember him?) did some vocal work on the ""Sweat"" release, he would have been a great replacement. As far as JT less KT&G goes, I'd recommend the ""Sweat"" or ""Unite"" releases."
1,UnKool,"True fans of Kool & The Gang will be greatly disappointed by this farce of an album! It is far from ""Something Special"" and should cause no ""Celebration"". It's rap, rap rap, with three capital ""C's""!!! Apparently the Bell family is no longer interested in REAL MUSIC. If it were possible to give NEGATIVE stars, this effort (of lack there of) should be in the double-digits."
3,Okay for one trip,Pros:~Large size~Many pocketsCons:~Cheap straps~Connectors/clips Break~Waist Strap is useless (too small)~Adjustment for snug fit is non existent~Stitching will break at seamsConclusion:Not a good BACKpack. This bag will work to hold items as long as you don't need to carry the bag on your back for extended periods of time (more then a half hour) it is very uncomfortable and provides no support. The bag will hold A LOT and if you plan on carrying it on your back do not get this bag. Fork over the dough and go for a nicer name brand bag. If you need a bag to carry from the airport to the taxi to the hotel this would work. But this is not a good safari bag.
2,Very Disappointing,"Reading this book was like drinking warm diet coke--flat and artifically sweet. Really just a rehash of the Abraham Hicks/Law of Attraction materials, this books fails to motivate or inspire. Between the plugs for the author's internet program and audio products there is just flat prose. Even the sample meditation is uninspired.The law of attraction has been addressed countless times and this book adds nothing to the mix. If you are seeking a thorough understanding of the law of attraction and techniques to assist you in its mastery, you would be better served by works by other authors, including Esther and Jerry Hicks, Lynn Grabhorn, Michael Losier and Joe Vitale. Avoid this tired retread."
3,Not great! There are much better books on the subject!,"I didn't really care for this book. It may touch other people differently than it touched me. After all, different things touch people in different ways. This didn't really work out for me. It was just a rehashing of the same-old same-old out there already.If you're looking for a new angle on wealth attraction, try True Prosperity by Yehuda Berg or the one I book I keep coming back to over and over again, The Trick to Money is Having Some by Stuart Wilde. You may also like Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker which is also a great book.This one just didn't cut it for me. There's nothing new or different about it than everything else that's out there."
4,Good book emphasising action steps and hurdles,"This is a good book on the law of attraction. It takes the material in ""The Secret"" to the level of practical application. The author emphasizes the action steps needed to use the law of attraction. He has also dedicated a section on answering questions one might have on using the laws described. I think this book is a must read for anyone starting out on using the law of attraction."
4,Bob Doyle is Awesome!,"Bob's message and information are paramount!The Law of Attraction is, by far, the # 1 Law of ""Inner Consciousness"" law to follow to guide yourself in the direction of Wealth!It Takes Inner Development (The Law of Atraction/Manifestation) & Outer Development (The Marketplace/Financial Planning)to solidify your ability to create ""Wealth Beyond Reason""Thomas S FisherAuthor: Pennies to Billions"
1,Unoriginal,"A crappy e-book that repeats everything in every other book written about the law of attraction. And it's not at all clear to me why the reader should take this guy's advice in the first place, as the author seems to have led an unremarkable life."
5,Incredible Book,"I read this book a long time ago when it was originally written and was amazed at Maegaret's insights and her ability to express what she was seeing.I think everyone who wants to know about Jesus should read this book. I think this would apply to people who know Jesus as Savior, and also for people who are wondering about ""who this Jesus is."" I can promise you that you won't be bored or offended.This book succeeds in being different from what I think is kinda ""said it before, say it again"" type of Christian writing.I find a lot of Christian writing (mostly fiction-type novels) as pretty boring, and no up to the literary standards of many secular writers. This doesn't mean Christian writers such as Eugene Peterson and C.S. Lewis who are superb.I probably read over 100 books a year, so I guess I do have some expertise in what is good reading, at least from my point of view.Bonnie Julian"
2,Disappointing,"This book was very disappointing to me because I was expecting something substantial and this is just a tiny little book of really short poems. If you want a novelty book this is it but I was expecting fiction, not poetry."
5,a great gift of high culture,"Appiah surly has a gift with pen in hand, and this book here is perhaps one of the most comforting book I have read covering a range of intellectual disciplines; anthropology, ethics, cultural geography, humanism, moral, sexuality, sociology, and virtues to name a few ""areas"" the book brushes on. It brushes on these topics in a very eloquent and reader friendly fashion.I think that this book is a great gift of high culture in a world in change. The book is timely, historically, and offers messages of insight as well as messages of hope for the future of humanity and our interactions with our fellow beings.Bravo"
3,My perspective on Appiah,"Needed to buy this book for a class on ethics in public health. I felt that Appiah's global perspective and prosaic use of language made the book a lot easier to read. However, he relies a lot on personal examples and I sometimes found myself wondering what exactly his lengthy examples were trying to say. I appreciated the non-western view though.Wouldn't read it for fun, but if you're reading it for class (especially ethics) I've read much worse."
3,Accept the complex,"Although K. Appiah starts on a very solid and sometimes difficult philosophical ground, the essay seems to lost itself into the richness and the complexity of humanity. Which does not necessarily make it uninteresting. On the contrary. The parallels drawn from personal experience, archeology, capitalism and so forth are at times enlightening and original. Besides the advices on how to converse properly, I was left with a taste of subtle fatality hidden behind a veil of optimism."
4,"Great, but not Excellent","Mason's work in Shadow is an excellent beginning to an author that possesses such a deep understanding of military manuvers, lingo, etc. The details are what captured me in this book, particularly the story of the team's sniper. I felt a little lost towards the middle of the book, but I suppose most book are that way. Overall, he is NO Clancy, however, his next book is still something I would like to take a look at.GOOD JOB!-Sunil James"
3,a little slippery,"I bought this for my two hermit crabs (each a little larger than a quarter) and they have a little trouble getting up the ramp because the plastic is rather slippery. I packed some sand all the way around it so that they don't have so far to climb. It looks good in my crabitat.. I wish it was ""rock"" colored instead of green. overall, it's just okay."
3,HMS HOOD,"The instructions are not that good. For example, the single cannon directions were not that clear.Also, the anti-aircraft guns, the mast, and the bridge break easily.The motors do not stay on very well and the lifeboat launchers will not stay on.All in all, I think unless you are very good at building models I don't recommend for beginners.And there may be some extra pieces."
3,Disappointed,"I have a hard time believing that these pearls are AA quality. They are of a very nice size, but every single pearl has significant visible flaws. And the luster is not that amazing. Well, when you wear them, they still look nice, but I believe I could get a better product for the price. Previously I purchased pearls from the Amazon collection that were described as A quality. They are nearly perfect, and the luster is fantastic. I payed for them significantly less than these pearls that I am reviewing. I was torn between keeping or returning them for a while, but I will be traveling for a long time, so it looks like I am stuck with them."
5,Classic Score for a Classic Film of a Classic Play,"As just about everyone has written, this is a wonderful score, definitely the best of those coming from repeated collaborations between Kenneth Branagh and composer Patrick Doyle. In passing, though, one should also give credit to the venerable and talented Lawrence Ashmore, who was responsible for the orchestrations. As a film score, it fits its movie quite well, though I confess that I find the Non nobis, Domine section -- which comes in the aftermath of Agincourt -- gives the film a bit of an anachronistic jolt, with a 15th Century battlefield overlaid with music that smacks too much of Romantic sensibility. Of course, if you're just enjoying this disc as music, that becomes a meaningless quibble. In any case, the Agincourt sequence itself is about as ominous, stirring and propulsive as you can get, and it's just one part of an outstanding score. Highly recommended."
5,A PERFECT COMBINATION,"It is quite dificult to find a score that matches so perfectly with the images on the film. But Doyle has done it. Since the first notes, that great, dark opening, the story is told not only by the words of Shakespeare or the images. Music is also a narrator.Tracks like Death of Bardolph, or the great Battle of Agincourt, express all the emotion, power and passion the play has.I consider this score as a real piece of classical music. And the direction by Simon Rattle is also perfect. The strings and choirs going together in a perfect blend.Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."
5,"An Intriguing, Intense Score","This soundtrack has a dark intensity very appropriate for the play's setting and subject. It begins with an eerie, striking opening title, and continues with a well-sequenced series of emotion- and thought-provoking pieces, interspersed with Latin hymns and brilliantly rendered speeches. It stands very well on its own. My only complaint is that the recording level isn't perfect in the opening piece; the orchestra comes in too loudly after the flutes open that segment, reducing clarity of tone.For other excellent Shakespeare soundtracks, try Jocelyn Pook's The Merchant of Venice--which is even more fascinating than this CD is--and the uplifting Much Ado About Nothing composed by Patrick Doyle. Try also to order an out-of-print copy of the two-CD set Shakespeare at the Movies."
5,Soul Stirring!,"A beautiful soundtrack of a wonderful film. If ""Non Nobis"" does not move you to tears, check your pulse (you could be dead). Well-done."
3,OK for light service,"The cutters are very flimsy. OK for light service, but not very good for large production of cookies. Would probably work fine for use once a year."
3,Too Small,"I can't argue that the dimensions were available, but it seemed as though it would be large enough for a day outing with a camera and an extra lens. Not so. My 50D, battery grip, 17-55 lens nearly filled the space. I was not able to add another lens in the bag while the camera was in it. A flash would fit in the remaining space, and some small items such as batteries, filters, and the like. It's a sturdy little bag, and I think it will serve some use as an accessory bag (with a couple of smaller lenses - forget a large zoom) if I don't put a camera in it. I like the construction, etc., and will keep it - perhaps also purchase a larger bag from Lowepro. I certainly cannot fault their quality."
4,Good for a lot of kits,"The bag is bigger than what I expected but overall it is good for people who have a lot of kit tools and lens. I put one camera, two lens (one zoom len and one kit len), and some basic tool kits. This bag is just too big for me to carry around.It is also pretty secured for carrying the camera for one place to the other, but it is not an active photographer friendly bag. It takes time to unlock, and then unzip the bag. If you want to use the bag as your on duty bag, this might not be a right bag for you, but if you need a bag to carry your camera from one place to another, this is the perfect bag for you."
4,High quality as expected,"This product is great with my D700 and my D200 combined. It holds both bodies, and is tall enough to support both of these with the battery grip included. There is also enough room for my Nikon 20mm/2.8, Nikon 18/55(these two have to be stacked on top of each other, a divider is provided), and my Nikon 70-300. I can also throw my Speedlight SB-800 on top. There is great room in the front or sides to put all of the memory cards you want.Overall, great product. A little too much though for just one camera and one lens. Go for something smaller if you aren't carrying several bodies and lenses."
4,Nuno: Post Extreme,"Nuno Bettencourt. Greatest guitarist of all time, as far as I'm concerned.Mourning Widows, Nuno's new group, is quite good. This particular CD is also very good.I gave this CD a 4 instead of a 5 because I think all of the older Extreme albums were 5s. Nuno's own stuff hasn't quite matched the quality of Extreme. It's a different sound, and I'm a little disappointed at times with the quality of Nuno's performance. Still excellent, mind you, but it's as if he's redirected some of his energy for Mourning widows and therefor doesn't concentrate on his awsome guitaring capabilities.If you liked Extreme, then you should collect Mourning Widows' CDs.[....]"
4,An essential disc for Nuno fans,"At first, the Mourning Widows debut didn't really hook me; it didn't seem to have the depth of some of Nuno's previous recordings (Extreme's _III Sides to Every Story_ and Nuno's _Schizophonic_ were incredibly great--and incredibly under-appreciated--albums in my opinion); at first blush it sounded very oriented toward pop lyrics and power chords. But, like Schizophonic, it has really grown on me, and as a big Nuno fan, I'd definitely consider it a Must Own disc."
4,Almost as good as Schizophonic!,"Nuno is an awesome musician, maybe someday people will appreciate his fine work. Check out Extreme's III Sides album to hear just how good a song-writer he is, Schizophonic is his best solo venture, with LOTS of cool songs!"
3,"NOT BAD, BUT THEIR FOLLOW-UP IS BETTER","This is a pretty good CD, but their follow-up CD ""Furnished Souls For Rent"" rocks quite a bit harder. Matter of fact, some of the songs on this CD are redone on FSFR, but only a couple. If you don't have any Mourning Widows stuff, this ain't a bad CD to start with. But if you already have FSFR, you may be a tad let down by this one - it doesn't pack quite the same punch."
3,Not great but not bad either.,"Although I still think Nuno is an amazing guitarist and musician in general, this Mourning Widows disc just doesn't do it. After Schizophonic (an INCREDIBLE CD) I eagerly awaited this one. I kept reading about how he was trying to make this great funk-rock album but after listening to it a few times, I think he fell short. He has obviously experimented with some new sounds and styles and it doesn't work here. The first few songs are great but it kind of falls apart after that."
2,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING THIS ITEM,"Covers the charging port for your Razr phone. So when you decide to charge your cellphone, you are forced to take whole plastic cover off first. Very inconvenient."
5,Fantastic,"I was fortunate enough to see this movie in a soldout theater during its cross country tour. It was a very mixed audience with younger and older people. Everyone loved it! It had people laughing at some scenes and gasping during others. The acting is truly wonderful, Natasha Lyonne in particular is superb. Her transformation is brilliant. There really is not a weak link in the cast. I have never been much of a fan of the horror genre, but this film transcends that label and tells a good story in a dark and funny way. I could hardly wait for the video and have loved watching all the extras. It will be fun to see what Mr. Grannell comes up with for his next project."
2,"Decent maps, boring read","I did not have any histories on this last phase of the Petersburg campaign, so I picked up this study. The maps are decent---the best part of the book. However, what just puts me to sleep is Greene's prose. Better take some appropriate medication prior to cracking this one if you want to stay awake! The facts about the campaign and battle are there, but, in my opinion, the read is as dry as dust. This, in turn, renders the book a bore for this reader."
2,Save your money!,I stumbled across this while I was looking for a replacement for the Betrayal single I've worn out over the years. I have this on vinyl as well and never thought much of it. I was disappointed by it when it came out. It seemed like a watered down N.O./C.O.X./L.L. Nothing worth more than $15 for sure!
4,Pretty good,"Mmmmmm, this was good, but not the best Manson CD ever, if you want my opinion, if you have never bought a Manson CD and you want to, buy this one last, get Portrait or Antichrist Superstar, or even Semlls Like Children, this ones good, but I expected a little better. None the less, this is still worth buying, thank god Marily has finally got over his obsession with burning tyhings!(lol) But, as I said, this is a good CD, it mixes harmony with Metal, buy it, enjoy it, just dont expect it to be as good as Antichrist Superstar"
4,"Different, Futuristic and emotional",Now that Mansons exposing his feelings this album has the talent that they always did have but theres one extra component its called emotion. Songs like I dont like the drugs (but the drugs like me) are a bit lacking in substance although some songs aren't that good they have many songs which are amazing this shows that Marilyn Manson do have talent and in fact are not living on imagery. I highly reccomend this album.
1,WHAT????????????????,"I've never really liked marylin manson he/she is not one of my favorites, definitely. Out of all of his songs I've only liked 2, Beautiful People and Dope Show. Dope Shope, I gotta admit is pretty darn good. It's just Marylin Manson that ticks me off. Why does he act so stupid, I mean people that follow his example take drugs or are probably going to end up taking drugs and/or do stuff that is or already did mess up their lives. I know some of the rumors going around aren't true, but I mean come on people, WHAT is Marylin Manson!"
5,BEST ALBUM OF 1998,"When I first bought Mechanical Animals (the day it came out) I didn't know what to expect from the cd, I was a huge fan of all of his earlier work such as Portrait and Antichrist, but nothing prepared me for this cd...It is loud, soft, agressive, tender, everything you want in a cd all wrapped up in one...Manson's cd's keep getting better and better...I hope the next one is this good"
4,TRIPPIN LICKIN GOOD,"THE FIRST TIME THAT I TRIPPED ""BALLS TO THE WALL"" I LISTENED TO MARILYN MANSON. IT WAS THE MOST ASTOUNDING TRIP I HAD EVER TAKEN. ""THANK YOU"" MARILYN MANSON."
2,Average sell-out rock and roll...,"Manson's ""Mechanical Animals"" is a fair follow-up to his ""Antichrist Superstar."" The album does lack musical talent. Although he has tried numerous times, he cannot top his older songs which were much more robust and angry. Manson has now done what most artists eventually do....sell out."
2,Nothing like AntiChrist Superstar,"This album, honestly, sucks. It has a completely different sound than AntiChrist Superstar. No Manson screaming, no pounding guitars...the beats are recycled 80's type techno. Where's the Manson of old? No raw energy on this. It all sounds too musical. Marilyn Manson got millions of fans with AntiChrist Superstar. Great album. Diehard Manson fans won't believe what they are hearing when they get this. It's a totally new sound, and other than Dope Show, there's nothing worth listening to. And that's coming from a longtime Manson fan."
2,"close, but no cigar","what's sad about this cd is that brian warner might have had a chance at actually creating a band with talent had he not decided to go the way he has, creating a falsified image of his ideals with a girl's name, weird clothes and promoting himself as an individual while encouraging a cult following. His music is interesting in some asp-ects but talk about wasted potential. He's capitalising on the american teenager's need to be different, an iconolast, an original. What's ironic is that everyone who calls themselves mansonites is trying as hard as possible to be like him so that they can be different. that's not very individual fellas, if you ask me."
1,Sell Out,"I have nothing against Marilyn Manson and have all of his other albums and have been one of his many supporters since his awkward years in Florida. When I heard this album I nearly died of complete disgust. He says that this album is his post inauguration and that he's found where his compromise between the extremes of his soul. Well if it is I guess I won't be buying anymore Marilyn Manson albums. If anything needs to be found it should be Brian Warner, the boy who just loved rock and roll. I think he actually thinks he's his stage name, Marilyn Manson. Before he makes anymore music he needs to find himself because even if Marilyn Manson has come out of his worm stage and gotten his wings, his soul, Brian Warner, is long gone and now feeding the worms."
1,You don't have to be a Christian to hate Marilyn Manson.,"I know grunge was a reactionary movement, and had to die sooner or later. But hasn't it taught us a few things? Like ""wearing red jumpsuits with sequins really isn't that cool""? This album heralds the return of glam. It is a load of the most prodigious tripe I've ever heard. Sometimes his lyrics seem intriguing, but on closer analysis they all seem to be about selling out, which is pretty corny, and a bit rich coming from this darling of MTV. Manson's excuse for his sensationalism and ludicrous clothing is that he is trying to ""make people think"". He comments on commercial by being ""faker than fake"". Well it isn't. It's just fake."
3,Bowie Did It Better!,"This album is Manson's best yet (in my esteemed opinion). However, I would like to comment on the overwhelming amount of material in the album that was, in a nutshell,recycling David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust character. Throughout the album, there are many references to early Bowie material. One example being Manson's referring to a ""space man"" and a ""dead astronaut in space"" (Major Tom reincarnate?). Some of the music heavily borrows from such Bowie classics as Fame, Fashion, and Space Oddity amongst others. Bowie is the originator of Glam, and this phase of Manson cements the idea of the sequels being disappointing compared to the originals. Bowie is still the greatest example of Glam while Manson is merely impersonating."
2,"Not half bad, not half good either","Marilyn Manson reminds you of that famous quote--was it H.L. Mencken who said it?--""Never underestimate the stupidity of the American public."" Let's add to that, ""especially the stupidity of American teenagers."" Manson's industrial-terror stuff was really tedious, but at this point in the game the man really should get his own tunes. If it's David Bowie you want then, for God's sake, buy Ziggy Stardust. Pissing off Christian America is hardly an accomplishment, either. Gay America does that easily enough, and for reasons that are far more important and meaningful."
4,I give it 4 stars because they are on a Rollercoaster!,"Manson sure can turn heads anywhere he pleases to go! He stills knows how to Rock and tell fans why he had such change to his appeal! The Albums says it all in Life of the Rich and Famous inparticular to some. Just can't wait to see what he has up his A**, For the next Coming year! Stay Hard!"
2,Warning:,"This is a well written book that will probably help if you have a child that is mildly challenging. If you know or suspect your child has oppositional defiant disorder, get professional help."
2,Nothing new here,"Book isn't worth the money, go the library and borrow a copy if you want to read it."
3,review,"I like the ideas and plans the book has if you are dealing with a defiant child. They suggest implementing one step each week and then proceeding from that point. The method makes sense to me, making it a part of your life is another tough one, however..."
5,Handle your child with love,"I read the book in 2001. It has impressed me ever since. I have several books on this subject. I consider this book is the best.The book provides you with the principles and methods to handle a very stubborn kid (but not the kid with a mental disorder).For example, the biggest thing a kid needs is love. But what is love concretely? It is an attention. It is the time that we spend with the kid. But how to spend the time effectively? It is not by controlling him/her. It is by giving him/her the freedom to enjoy the time spent together.I have not followed exactly the methods provided in the book, but the concept has been very useful for me to deal with my child."
5,EXCELLENT ADVICE,"I'VE READ MANY BOOKS ON CHILDREN AND HOW TO HANDLE THEM. THIS WAS THE BEST BY FAR. IT IS AN EASY READ AND THE PROGRAM ABSOLUTELY WORKS, AS LONG AS YOU ARE CONSISTENT."
1,Not a big hit in our household,"This is just another rehashing of the same old reward and punishment doctrine. There's little new or fresh here...in fact, the strategies in this book actually made things worse. Not the book to read if you're looking for real help with a child who hasn't responded to traditional ""good discipline."""
2,Look for something else.,"This has terrible motion blur in fast-moving scenes (or even medium-speed scenes), due to its high 12ms pixel response time. It is also very difficult to see detail in low-lit scenes, due to its 800:1 contrast ratio. In dark scenes, distinguishing what is going on is impossible. This TV was a huge disappointment. After doing much research, I have learned that you need 8ms or lower pixel response time to avoid motion blur on LCDs and contrast ratio at least 10,000:1 (recommended). Try to look for those two features (among others) when choosing an HDTV. This particular Sharp model is very basic. You could find better quality for your money with a different HDTV."
2,"SHARP LCD TV, LC-32SH20U","I bought this model in Sept. 2006 and within 18 months it started to fail upon power up. After several tries it would finally become functional. The screen posts a ""please wait"" message. Now, after a little over 27 months it is permantly in-operable. The same message is on the screen. While this tv has a nice screen, good resolution, etc. it is worthless when it won't come on. Poor reliability!!"
3,Don't think this is an Aquos TV,"Researched quite a bit and found that this TV is *NOT* marketed by Sharp as an Aquos. Apparently they now have a perhaps lesser-quality line LCD-TV, and this TV is not an Aquos. Notified Amazon of this too."
1,"Poor quality, poor service","I bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months. Send it to service center to checkup, was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced. when request to get back the replaced lcd control board, was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board, it has to be shipped back, otherwise, you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board.. it's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor..But, if you do want to get a sharp, better get a long long warranty.."
2,Frustrating,"First of all, my 7 year-old was VERY revved up about this! She is a complete Potter-nut, and was looking forward to trying this on her brand new Wii. Well, it was hard. The game starts with the death-eater attack in the underground walkway from the movie, before you have any clue how to fight them. After repeated attempts, we settled on waving our arm/controller vehemntly in the air and pushing buttons, and that worked. Then you are brought to Sirius Black and friends, and are made to practice different tasks, which works, kinda, but it's all very.. imprecise. Then you start walking around the school, at which point we were tired of it all, and just moved around to get the feel for things. We have to give it and ourselves more time learning it all, but the games I've played before have been more intuitive. Frustrating that what must surely be the target audience, finds it too difficult."
2,Annoying playability,Vastly inferior to the HBP game. Tough to even move or inspect anything with Ron and Hermione constantly in the way. Constant nagging to complete the current task makes the mute button your best friend. Only the Gobstone and Wizard Chess games are truly fun.
3,Wingardium Leviosa: The Game,"That's what they should have titled this game, because that's practically all you do--float things around, with a few brief duels thrown in. Oh, and a lot of wandering back and forth to different parts of Hogwarts, looking for people.I was very disappointed in the last game (Goblet of Fire) but had high hopes for this one, especially with the Wii. And while it is a fun novelty to use the remote like a wand, and the graphics are great, the game itself is a bore. I would also say it's too short, but I won't because given how dull it is, short is a blessing.There's no running, no jumping, no puzzling out what you're supposed to do. Now that the game designers have showed off what wonderful graphics they can do and what fun it is to use wand movements, maybe they can turn their talents to actually creating an enjoyable game next time."
1,Crapfest 07,"I am a huge harry potter fan, yet this game is the worst game I have ever played in my entire life.Graphics: Of course because it's on the wii the graphics are worse than the other systems and made me wish that I had bought the 360 version.Gameplay: Horrible, absolutely horrible, you don't have control after you cast the spells, targeting the item you want to cast a spell on is impossible because the targeting system auto-locks on the first thing it sees and wont let you choose something else unless if you turn away and look somewhere completely different than where your target is.Camera: The camera was made by a druggie with no programming experience. It is unmovable, and only goes at the angle it's supposed to be about 20% of the time. Moving on stairs is hard, casting spells is hard, and some times during conversations all you see is the gray from instead of the person you are talking to's head.Overall: This game will make you hate Harry Potter."
2,no good for babies with eczema,My son has severe eczema and I tried many different formulas. I was told by a good friend that elecare was a really good product and should try it. My son's eczema got WORSE.. I spent alot of money with no results. If your child has eczema this product may not work for you.
3,Decent price but wobbly,"These chairs aren't bad, and you can't go wrong with the price, however 3 out of the 4 I received were wobbly, no amount of adjusting, loosening and tightening would get them right. However it's not that noticeable when sitting in them, and you can put felt pads on the feet to lessen the wobble. I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could..."
2,NGK,"JUST SPEND A LITTLE MORE MONEY AND BUY THE IRIDIUMS, TRUST ME. THESE ONLY LASTED ONE MONTH. THE IRIDIUMS LASTED OVER A YEAR"
3,Lasts about as long as it will take to read this review,"Smells great (in my opinion), feels good, lathers good (so at least 3 stars), but in the shower lasts about as long as it took you to read this review. At almost $5 a pop thinking I will go back to the $3 olive oil soap that lasts me a month."
5,The best natural soap you can buy,"I'm a big fan of natural soaps, and I've tried a lot of different ones, but this is by far my favorite. It's become the only one I buy. Plus shipping is surprisingly fast."
4,smells nice,i bought this because i was looking for an all natural soap for my wife. i love the smell. she thinks its ok. overall a good value.
2,ZUM BAR- FRANKINCENSE & MYRRH,"I HAVE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT BEFORE, FROM ANOTHER SELLER.EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A 2017 DATE, ON WRAPPER,WHICH APPEARS TO BE AN EXPIRATION DATE,THIS BAR OF SOAP, USED FOR THE FIRST TIME, HAD NO SUDSING ACTION, & MINIMAL FRAGRANCE,UNLIKE PAST PRODUCT USAGE."
1,Not a 6 pack!,"This is not a 6 pack... only one bar of soap comes. Definitely disappointed with that false information. The soap itself is amazing, however."
3,SMELLS AWESOME! DISSOLVES TOO FAST!,"If you want to make sure the scent is powerful, then this is it! However, the bar dissolves very quickly....of course, it will depend on how you use it, but still...it is the one with the strongest scent of cinnamon I have found as of yet."
5,Patchouli Soap at its finest,"Zum Bar Goat's Milk Soap comes hand wrapped and boxed in recycled material. So if your green, this company caters to you. Also the soap had a distinct black licorice smell right out of the box. Not to worry, this went away in the shower. In the shower the patchouli scent really comes out strong. The scent is dead on. The way i expect patchouli to smell. As far as it being soap, i can not say much about how good it is, or isn't, because i am a man that is not interested in such things. The soap did clean my skin, and left a subtle patchouli scent. So if your not wanted to be covered in the odor of patchouli, this is the soap for you. Its not overpowering in any way. One thing I have been noticing lately is that the soap tends to disolve faster than my regular store bought soaps. No big deal though. When i am through in the shower, i take the soap out of the shower, and let it dry on the shelf. I am 100% satisfied with this product."
2,"Nice soap, but does not last long",I love the smell of lemongrass but this was a little overwhelming and the soap seemed to dissolve away to quickly. Lathered up nice and left skin feeling good but fragrance was to strong for me.
4,Zum's Frankincense and Myrrh soap.,"I Like Zum's Frankincense and Myrrh(just bought the hand and body liquid ).It does cleanse well,fresh smelling too.I bought mine from Quality Goods ect, they packaged my item extremely well,I also received two small samples of zum soap(I'm not sure which 2-they weren't labled)however it was appreciated.I must be frank here(no pun intended) even though I enjoy Zums Frank and Myrrh's fragrance- I feel Nubian Heritage has them beat.Nubian Heritage(no ,I don't work for, am not related to, own no stock in) this company just a customer on amazon like you. I think it's more of an opulent fragrance,(their blend,) TRULY CELESTIAL!! I AM going back to My one true Frankincense and Myrrh, at least you should give it a try if you love the smell/fragrance of Frankincense and Myrrh as I do."
5,another gem from Jessica Williams,"If you have never heard her live, either solo or with her trio, you are missing an incredible event. While she has her own unique, very creative and melodic stylings they are all wrapped deep in her knowledge of the music of the masters, Ellington, Miles, etc. This Side Up is (I think) the third CD for the Max Jazz ""Piano Series"" and her first for this label after recording much on her own label. The Max Jazz releases are all immaculately produced and photographed, with Jimmy Katz's great black and white photos. If you like (for example) Keith Jarrett's standards trio and Bill Evans you will enjoy this CD very much."
1,What a disappointment!,"This is the first review I've ever written and am doing so because this book was such a disappointment. At 76 pages it's closer to a pamphlet. ""For the Older Adventurer"" seems to be more of a marketing phrase, as little if any info specific to (we) older folks is actually included.Go with ""Long Distance Hiking"" It has nearly everything in this book and much, much more."
1,badly written,"I was very disappointed in this book. The gear list was perfuntory, the trail discriptions might have been more helpful if they were not written in the imperative. I was astounded that the author took special pains to critsize ""A Walk in the Woods"" and Bill Bryson more than once and then recommended the same book. I don't consider 49 to be particularly ""older"" and see this book as more of a general guide than one having tips for the older hiker."
5,The perfection of Amazon,The service and the product were perfect. Its always a pleasure to buy from AmazonGeorge Boulden
2,Pearl Fishers,"The singing over-powered the music so much, made it difficult to enjoy the flow of the opera."
4,Good Textbook,Bought this for my Humanities I class. It has helped me understand some of the events we talk about in class and the geography of the regions we're studying.
2,The West: A boring textbook,"This textbook is quite ""text-booky"" in the sense that there is a ton of names and dates, hardly any organization whatsoever... either way, I'm a good learner. I love history but I found the textbook to be boring and not helpful."
2,NOT as good as Brother Toner,"We have used Brother lasers for years in my business and enjoy Amazon's service and price on toner replacement. Well they (Amazon) no longer sell the TN-460 toner cartridge so we took a chance and bought this replacement after always buying OEM toner. Big mistake. Makes horrible clicking noises when printing, print quality is barely adequate. I guess it is time to replace the printers if we cannot get Brother OEM toner as this is no replacement."
3,You Gotta Give 'Em Props For Helping The Mentally Challenged,"I mostly bought this for Intergalactic. Great song, but I was surprised at the end of the song (at about the 3:30 mark). It cuts to the voice of a man that sounds mentally challenged and trying his hardest to string together some basic words that rhyme, and it takes him a long time to do so. But that's to be expected of someone that sounds like he's operating at a 3rd or 4th grade level. The sound byte obviously doesn't belong in an otherwise great-sounding song. So the best assumption any of us can make is that this was an act of charity. I think that's nice but I don't want to listen to it every time I listen to this song, so I cut that portion of the song out via software and THEN put it on my iPod.Maybe next time the guys could just write a check to their favorite charity and leave the music alone."
4,Beastie Boys For Life,"Surprisingly, being a huge Beastie Boys fan since the mid 80's I've only just begun to really listen to this album since it's 98' release. This album rivals check your head. Which is, arguably the best Beastie album.I realized something today while I was sitting in traffic on my way home from work. I'm going to be listening to the Beastie Boys for the rest of my life. Now, while this might seem silly. I found it to be quite profound. The amount and quality of material that they have released over the years is almost overwhelming when you look at it in full. Every time I delve into a new track or album, I'm amazed at the level of detail complexity that you find with each release. They have had such progression of work over the years."
3,Definately worth checking out,"this cd is not bad, but first check out the earlier albums. also listen to sabotage that song is class!!!!!!!!"
5,total badass,this album is one of the best.....unite is so rad...all the b-boys and b-girls get down!they just keep getting better and better....and to support them is to support more than the B-Boy....free Tibet!
2,"Honestly, not the greatest album! Way tp much hype about it","There are some good songs on the cd like intergerlatic and one other. However, if you like the Beastie Boys, the classic songs and albums are much better!!!!! Don't waste your money."
2,Not What I Expected,"The Beastie Boys are not the same on this album. They have 22 songs and only one of them (Intergalactic) became a hit? That just doesn't make sense. The songs are a lot less humorous than their best album, ""Liscensed to Ill"", and on half the songs the lead singer sounds screwed up. I have barely listened to it since i bought it in February. Do not buy this album if you want to hear some good beastie boys tracks. Instead by ""Liscensed to Ill"" or ""Sounds of Science"". The reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1? The song Intergalatic, which is awesome."
5,AWSOME CD,"This is an awsome cd, but not there best, it is still really good, the best songs are tracks 1,(super disco breaking), 2,(the move), 5,(just a test,) 12,(3mcs and 1 dj) 13,(the grasshoper unit,) 16(the negoteation limerick file) and 17(electrify)- this is an awsome cd"
5,The Beastie MCs Best,"Hello Nasty displays Beastie Boys finest talents, all packed into one CD. It shows their awesome MCing, and how it should be done. This CD is a keeper with songs like ""Body Movin'"" and ""Remote Control"" you can't go wrong. If you have heard some of the Beastie Boys earlier albums such as License to Ill, you will notice how young and ill-fated they sound. WOWEE, once you move onto this CD you won't even have to adjust to the new found maturity in this album, because it is so darn good. Great buy, one of my favorite party CDS. Goodluck shopping/browsing everyone!"
2,"Great rap songs, wierd ""other"" songs","The biggest problem with this album is that the Fatboy Slim remix of ""Body Movin'"" is the best song... and it's not actually on the CD! I appreciate experimental hip-hop, but the Beastie Boys seem to have hit upon the boring, uninventive side of experimentation. Why, for instance, do they ""sing"" on so many tracks? (See Mos Def for a rapper who can sing hooks or whole songs if he wants to.) I wanted to like this CD for years because I know that the Beasties are living legends. Sadly, the fact that this is the first CD I bought from them will keep me from ever exploring their legacy more closely. Try anything by Blackalicious, The Roots, or Common instead for some more well thought out hip-hop experimentation."
2,"Buy ""the Science of Things"" instead","All of the good songs from ""Hello Nasty"" are all on the Beastie's 2 CD set. The remix version of ""Body Movin'"" is better on ""The Science of things"" too. Not many good songs on this CD. Definately not great."
3,For electronic fans...,"I'm incredibly impressed by the electronic factor, which surpasses all of the Beastie's CDs. I'm a big fan of techno, so I can't rate this CD very low. However, the overall quality of these songs aren't as groundbreaking as other albums, like Paul's Boutique or Licensed to Ill. Hello Nasty remains essential still, especially for someone looking for more electronic beats from the Beasties."
2,This is not Hot!!!,"This album was over rated as far as beats and quality overall. I like rap and never discriminate against an artist because he or she has a different style, but point blank is this album s#$%s. It is alright in some of the beats, but this is the worst sampling and mixing I have heard in rap. They lack rhyming skills and could have done better on the production. Buy at your own risk!!"
3,Not good enough to be a Beastie Boys album...,"Did you ever listen CHECK YOU HEAD or ILL COMUNICATION? If not, so listen now! Forget HELLO NASTY! Too much convencional HIP-HOP! It has only three good tracks: Song for Junior, Picture this and Instant Death."
3,Great disk that could have been better,"Going by the incredible hype behind ""Intergalactic"" I decided to buy this CD throgh Amazon (because I had a gift certificate to waste. When it arrived I was thrilled and I put it in the player. Songs 1-7 excluding 5 were incredible. But smiles turned to frowns as the songs got more and more crappy. The rest of the CD wasn't Beastie Boys quality stuff. I figure if they wouldn't have taken such a dark approch and more of an immature one like they usually do this would have been an incredible CD."
3,Okay,"Why can't it be the late 80's again? The time when the b-boys were spittin' out awesome albums like an MC out of Whitecastle. Hello Nasty is okay, but not what I would expect from them. If you really want a good Beastie Boys CD, get Licensed to Ill or Paul's Boutique."
2,Sleepwalking,A tired and worn-out melange of crap. It's like someone left Paul's Boutique out in the sun for 10 years - bleached and lily-white.
2,Hmmm.,"This CD was pretty good. I am not a HUGE fan of rap, but I'm sure you would give this a full 5 stars if you were a rap fan. I love some of the songs though."
4,Not their best not their worst,"Not to bad Beasties. Some great song and some crappy ones. GREAT ONES: Super Disco Breakin, The Move, Body Movin, Intergalctic and 3 mc's and 1 dj. BAD ONES: Song for the man sucked a*sbut the cd in general kicked a*s"
1,hello nasty is right,worst beasties album... ever. stinks on ice. sounds like it was recorded in a few hours after the guys took some bad drops and then for some reason started thinking disco and robotic voices were cool.
1,Yuck...,"I used to be a big fan of the Beastie Boys when I was young, but now that I have actually had the pressure relieved of listening to be ""cool"", I can make my own decisions on what is good or bad, without the media or MTV messing around with my head... I look back on Beastie Boys' old stuff and some of it was really good, but I can no longer stand the corny voices. Once I bought this CD, hoping the Boys would change, I was officially out of my teen years. This CD is terrible, with the exception of the listenable pop songs ""Intergalactic"", ""Body Movin"" and .. Oh ya that's it, the rest all are terrible"
1,What the hell is this?,"After buying this CD on the evidence of hearing the first track in a club, I unfortunately found this to be the worst CD I have ever actually purchased. Fortunately I was able to get a refund."
1,The utter lack of talent here is truly astonishing...,"I only gave this CD a star because it was the lowest rating possible, otherwise I wouldn't have given it anything. I'm embarressed for the Beastie Boys because, frankly, ""Intergalatic"" is the worst song I have ever heard. I am offended by the this band's arrogance to obviously put no effort into this collection and expect people to buy it. What's even worse, even harder to imagine, is that anyone could like this crap."
3,Nothing compares to Paul's Boutique,This CD is good but nothing compares to Paul's Boutique. Simply the best.
5,Everything Paul's Boutique was...VERY GOOD,"SWEET arrangement of beats...the Dust Bros taught them well =) Definately if you like this CD then check out Paul's Boutique...they're so parallel it's not funny, yet so unique..."
3,"Well, it's ok, but...","It's been a while since the b-boys have put anything out and it seems like they really wanted to get with today's hip-hop sound on ""Hello Nasty,"" rather than create the sound that everyone else will be imitating tomorrow. Albums like ""Paul's Boutique"" and ""Ill Communication"" were ahead of their time and separated the Beasties from the rest of the pack. I think that TIME Magazine put it best when its music critic noted that it seems like the Beastie Boys were trying to imitate Beck."
3,A nice addition to a Beasty collection... but it falls short,"What can I say?? The Beasties are one of my favorites. Songs such as ""Intergalactic"" and ""Super Disco Breakin"" have that awesome beastie originality. I felt a lot of the songs on this album drifted... they just weren't centered on the roots and rythem that make the Beastie Boys. I felt myself drifting back to ""Check Your Head"" and ""Liscensed to Ill"". I can't get enough of the of the older albums, I just grow tired of ""Hello Nasty"". As the album wairs on, it kind've dies off and grows quiet. To sum it up, I loved the first 30 minutes of the album... but found myself walking away from the second half which was mostly ""blah"". I like the Beasties, like their albums, but wish a little more effort was put into this album. It brought the Boys back, but could have been better."
2,BOOOOO! The worst beastie album yet!!,"Its a beastie album, but their worst yet. It's as bad as Pauls Botique, if not worse. I was sorely dissapointed with the album. Its leading track ""Intergalatic"", is an ok song but annoying after a few times. It is a very weak track to lead an album with. If I were you I would save my money for ill communication and license to ill the best beastie albums"
1,this cd sucks,the beastie boys are spoiled rotten. they have writers block. they s*ck as musicians. they barely have any new creative ideas. they aren't that funny anymore. they just aren't trying. grnadroyal is a corperate vanity project without street cred. the beasties have not supported alternative hip hop because they know that there are about 20-100 kids in each american city who can house them. pop culture needs to wake up to this. the beastie boys need to wake up to this. if i was them i would be embaressed to put out a record this wack. i would have shelved this attrocity. please boycott the beastie boys until they make a decent effort.i can't say the beasties s*ck because it doesn't even sound like they are trying.
1,What a waste of beastie boy talent!,"I first got this cd as recommended from a friend, and i was appalled at the waste of their talent! Not only was the only good song intergalactic, but that wasn't even too good! I own every single beastie boys cd, but this one SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you feel you disagree or agree with me, please e-mail me."
1,Not as good as I expected,I was fairly disappointed with Hello Nasty. There was only one good song on the whole cd (Super disco breakin). I would recommend Ill communication to all beastie boy fans. I hope they go back to their other style (rap/rock)!
1,Say Hello nasty,Good god what an awful CD I like the beastie boys licens to ill but this cd was nasty. There is one good song that is interglactic
1,Umm...,"To be honest, I'm not a Beastie Boys fan. Nor will I ever be. The CD is not fun to listen to. I don't know any better way to put it. I don't see what all the hype is about either. It's just a bunch of white guys trying to do some kind of disco/techno/rap. I emphasize the word ""try"". The only song that I can stand is Intergalactic. I couldn't the first five times I heard it, either. I had to desensitize myself to it."
3,A minor disappointment,"Okay. I'm 13 years old, so I never really got exposed to the Beastie Boys. Until now. I've always known them, ever since I saw ""Sabotage"" on a Beavis and Butt-head episode, and then when I heard ""Intergalactic"", I got my lazy as off the couch and bought it. After listening to it about 3 times, it gets kinda boring. But, it the rhymes of their first album (Old-school Beastie Boys isn't on this album- it's on ""Some old BS"" and songs like ""Heart Attack Man"") are definetely displayed, with a familiar sense of stupid fun, although not as good as ""Brass Monkey"" or ""Girls"". All in all, not as good as ""License to Ill"", but better than ""Some old BS"", ""The In Sound From Way Out"", and ""Check Your Head"". I would also commend it for introducing me to the group- after that I bought (in order) ""License to Ill"", ""Ill Communication"", ""Check Your Head"", ""Some Old BS"", ""In Sound From Way Out"", ""Paul's Boutique"", ""Root Down EP"", and every ""Hello Nasty"" import singles. A good buy."
4,Not Bad,"Personally this is my least favorite B Boys album. Thats not a bad thing seeing how I have all of them and the Beasties are my favorite of all time. I still listen to Hello Nasty all the time but there are a few problems. Some of the songs I just can't get into. But some songs are great. Overall, this is a good album, and I would recommend it. If you're a big B Boys fan and are expecting another Check Your Head or Ill Communication, you may be slightly disappointed.Best songs:Intergalactic3 MCs and 1 DJGrasshopper UnitPutting Shame In Your GameElectrify"
5,This Album Has Class.,"Just when you forgot who was the true professor of super funk, the Beasties rattle home with a masterful experience in extasy. This Album combines the best of soothing hip hop sounds with the over powering base lines that Beastie fans have come to expect. Mike D, Ad Rock and Juach have not softened their perspectives on this album, and numerous lyrics from the album promise to gain legendary status as they are immediately ripped off sampled by goons who can only try to be as beastie as the Beastie Boys."
3,Filler up,"Everytime I listen to this, I can't help thinking how good ""Check your head"" and ""Paul's Boutique"" are. This is just not that solid. I'm all up for expierimentation, but the last half of this is just not that fun to listen to. There are numerous good rap tracks that remind me of their first 2 albums, but too much that simply does not satisfy what most B-Boy fans are looking for. If this could have been only 12-15 songs it would have come off much better. All the filler just drags this down from being really good, to really ok."
3,I expected a little more,"I mostly got this because of the songs ""Intergalactic"",""Body Movin"",""Remote Control"",and ""3 MCs and 1 DJ"". The good part about this cd is that it has 22 songs. The bad part is that about half of the songs are good. It has a lot of songs with no words in it, just a beat. So overall I'd say this cd is just ok, but not great."
2,"Listened once, liked it. Listened twice, bored.","The first time I listened to Hello Nasty I thought it was a good but not great album. After hearing it a few times I realized that the lyrics are tired and overused. When describing the album to one of my friends I said ""They are like a bunch of Parrots with a 200 word vocabulary."" Hey Beasties when are you going to stimulate the mind?"
3,I think this CD is pretty good.,This Cd is pretty ok but it is to expensive! I would get this Cd if you like funny kinds of songs. I gave this Cd a three star rating.
4,I love this CD!!!!!!!!!,"I don't personally own this CD, but my stepbrother does and wwhenever I am with him this is the only thing we listen to."
2,"Not the best thing I ever heard, but not the worst.","I did not buy this CD. Actually, my brother did. He really likes the Beastie Boys, and I thought Why not listen to it? I did not expect anything, when I put in the CD. The first song really shocked me. How could anything be that bad? How could they expect anyone to listen to this? When the song starts, the bass is too loud. It reminded me of Michael Jackson playing a Nirvana or Metallica Song. The rest of the songs were a little better, but still not my style. After this experience, I do not think I will ever buy a Beastie Boys CD myself. Since it was not the worst CD I ever heard, I think it deserves 2 stars."
3,Over hyped but not that bad,After listening for months about this CD I finally heard the entire album today. Although the lyrics were pretty tight and there was a lot of funky sampling this album didn't quite live up to my expectations. Ill Communication is still the B-Boys album for me.
3,The Beastie Boys have let the beat drrrrrrrrrrrrrop,This definitely the Beastie Boys worst CD ever. Their were only two songs that I really liked and the rest were just awful. The 2 songs that were good were intergalactic and Three MC's and One DJ.
5,Ä,"Yo! this CD is jus a masterpiece by MikeD, AdRoCk and MCA, great Beastie Boys come back. I highly recommend this CD, tracks 1,2,3,7,12,17,19 all others are aight, dont like BeAsTiE BoYs? Dont matter, its a CD worth having. Thats all i got to say. FÜ$K"
3,"Fun, but not the genius of Ill Communication","Hello Nasty is a fun, energetic album with some great rhymes and clever lyrics, but it's also a lot of the same. I've heard ""money-making"" before ""can't,won't,don't stop"" before and ""body-rocking"" too. There is just nothing like the bare bass line of ""Sabotage"" or funky layering effect of ""Root Down"" on this one. Still, ""Remote Control"" has a hook to go along with the deeper metaphor and ""3 DJ's and an MC"" is full-blown Beastie joy. ""Hello Nasty"" is a good album, but the tricks have gotten a little stale at this point, and the depth of the last album just isn't there."
2,i am lowering my previous review....explanation below,"This album does not have a whole lot of music worth remembering on it. It seems like as the Beastie Boys get older, their creativity, emotion and humor decrease. Their first several albums were classics (see Pauls Botique, License to Ill and Chec k Your Head), but on this album, they fall short on lyrics, beats, and humor. They lack the freshness and originality that propelled them to their fame, and besides a few decent tracks (the first three, body movin, intergalactic, 3 mcs, and electrify), this album does not have the componenets of the true beastie boys we (or at least I) know and love. Nice effort, but in my book, it falls short."
1,"""Rap"" for kids with no taste","I wanted to cast my vote to sway the average review of this album. The Beastie Boys have come up with some great hip hop records, but this is pure garbage. The lyrics could have been written by a bunch of drunks making fun of rap. ""I like my sugar with coffee and cream"" . . . give me a break. I bet DJ Hurricane would have vetoed that one and most everything else besides. The Buddhist edge made for some interesting tracks on Ill Communication, but this love thy neighbor stuff and the illusion of appearances . . . if you really believe half of this, get out of the business. This is one of the most dissapointing albums of the 90's, up there with Soundgarden's Superunknown. Both of them were tremendously popular, and both were absurdly bad next to what came before."
1,Terrible,"This cd is horrible, the lyrics are cheezy and the music is stale and unoriginal... Anyone can throw a bunch of lyrics up against a lot of bass and the beastie boys did just that. This is why the Beastie Boys are my role models, they are terrible singers and writers, yet they have money... someday, I hope to be a non-talent millionaire... Go Beastie Boys."
2,"Swing, and a miss","Well, lets just say everyone gets old and loses a step. You can tell the Boys put a lot of work into this album, but I think the long break between albums took them out of the game. And they have never really recovered. The almost addicting styles of the former albums have been replaced with something that seems kind of forced, and never really hooks you. You want to like it, you really do, but the discrepancies in the sound and structure of the songs when compared to what made you like the previous albums so much, is too much to overcome. If this is your first B boys album, you will prob like it. But if you are more familiar with their previous four albums, Hello Nasty and all the albums that have followed so far, are not anywhere close to as good."
4,"Decent, but cluttered.","This is a decent record, but for my ears it is too cluttered. The Beasties definitely need an edit feature - they could make another Paul's Boutique if they excised some of the superflouous stuff."
2,"Downright crummy, and quite a letdown","After the stunning trifecta of ""Paul's Boutique"", ""Check Your Head"", and ""Ill Communication"", the Beastie Boys released ""Hello Nasty"", which has almost no socially redeeming or musical value.Musicianship, sonics, wit, humanitarian politics, obscure in-jokes, references to arcane sports figures, and just plain entertainment--all the hallmarks of the Beasties' best work--are notably absent from ""Hello Nasty"", replaced by generic turntablism, sophomoric social commentary, uglyass-sounding sonics... blech!"
4,"A Little Watered Down, But Fact is Anything Beastie ROCKS!","As said up above, I have to admit this album is probably not up to standard with the die-hards but it still majorly kicks as an album comparitively, the Beasties HAVE the beats and tracks like: Electrify, Body Moving absolutely keep it real, and with the introspective track I Don't Know they prove their excellence! Buy it, and jam to it. It's awesome."
3,Lackluster performance.,"This CD definitely lacks the musical genius that Check Your Head possesed. This effort finds the B-Boys COWERING behind their sampling work. Some of the tracks here are so devoid of energy and musical flow, that they are a painful experience. Check out that Mixmaster mike song to see what I mean (track 12). Embarrasing! The only good song is really Intergalactic, the rest are sooo boring! What happened to their musical talent? Sampling off of a arcade machine may be original, but it will not make a good song alone."
5,Intergalactic rules!!!,I don't listen to rap that much and this is the only exception. I have this album as well as License to Ill and Ill Communicator and they are all good. This is probably my favorite since it seems really original (not that their other stuff isn't). I pretty much like all of these tracks and I would reccomend this album to anyone.
4,MIX MASTER MIKE GIVES THE WHOLE ALBUM FLAV A,"STOP THE PRESSES!!!! THIS IS FOR ALL YOU WANNA BE CRITICS. YES I AGREE IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, BUT COME ON THIS IS LIKE THEIR BILLIONTH ALBUM GIVE THEM A BREAK. ASK YOURSELF HOW MUCH ORIGIONALITY IS REALLY OUT THERE. BEFORE YOU CRITISIZE ASK YOUR SELF DID YOU SEE ANY OF THEIR CONCERTS, OR HEAR ANY OF THEIR OTHER ALBUMS?"
3,"see ""intergalactic"" on mtv and start likin the b-boys?","THATS WACK! ive been listening to them since like 88'. ive gotta be honest,this album is not as good as their classics like pauls boutique or check your head. over all its an ok cd. ive sat and listened to all of the b-boys cds and i found this to have more of a hip hop influence, but theres nothing wrong with that. some of their rhymes seem weak compared to other albums. its one of those cds that you listen to a couple of times then it just sits on the shelf. and ive been listening to them for years now. thats all i have to say about that."
5,"The B-Boys are back, better than ever","This album is what the Beasties are all about. It is a collage of funked up, freaky, get down on the get down loops. They take everything from old-school base to classical to video game sound effects and mix it up into a seemless masterpiece. Everytime you hear this album, you will like it more than the last time. It sort of reminds me of the best tracks on Beck's Odelay (ie Novicane, High Five...), only better."
2,overrated,The B boys are back and maybe thats a bad thing. It seems that all they can do is rhyme their lyrics and scream the last word of each verse. This is true in about 90% of the songs and frankly its getting old. Tha album lacks the strong samples that were prominent on previous albums. When they were young it was breakthrough and now its stale. Perhaps they should stop worrying about Tibet and clothing and make better music.
5,Wow...the b-boys go back and prove they paved the way!,"Rivals Paul's Boutique..old school style, Mix Master Mike reallys shines..incredible CD!!! Lots of old rap samples...brings back memories!"
3,Average but still good,"I think this album is o.k. The beastie boys are losing their edge sorta. They are still good and due to artistic creativity they can rebound and do better. I would still buy this album,it is pretty good."
2,Over-Rated!,Not as good as their earlier works. My advice: Buy something with more than 2 good songs.
2,It's Fool's Gold,"I held off buying the album for quite some time and I should have kept on holding out. I really like tracks #5-8 but the rest of the cd is a drag. The hype machine went into overdrive on this cd (a la ""Titanic"") but I haven't figured out why."
4,Hello Nasty is worth it,"It isn't the Bestie Boys best, but you gotta realize that nothing will ever pass ""Licensed to Ill"". EVER! Bestie Boys changed a little from their prior Cds to this one, but that is ok. they make this Cd worth your money. I bought this Cd as not an all-out Beastie Boys fan. I actually was thinking about just getting an ""Intergalactic"" single, but I decided to give the Cd a try when I saw that the store didn't have the single. I'm glad I did, too. ""Body Movin'"" as their other song that many people have heard, but that isn't all that is good from this Cd. The whole Cd is full of the rap-like, yet rock-like sounds that you hear from the singles. This music is easily adapted to, and many people will find that they will like it.I especially recommend this to 311 or Red Hot Chili Pepper fans, people who have liked prior Beastie Boys Cds, or anybody who used to like like rock'rap music that came from Vanilla Ica, House of Pain, and those other cool bands from that style."
5,Great if you like all of their other CD's,This is a cool cd. It is great especially if you like the other cd's that they have made. There are some really good songs like Intergallactic and Body Movin'.Overall you should definatly get this!
2,Fatboy slim ripoff,I think fatboy slim music is more impressive than this stuff. I like body grovin' but the rest of the cd is not worth it. Buy the single..
3,cd,"im a big Beastie Boys fan, but i thought that the Hello Nasty wasnt as good as their old school stuff. its good and i do suggest buying it"
4,Its great,"Hello Nasty by the Beastie BoysIf you like rap than you will probably like this CD. It has many good tracks. Especially Intergalactic, The move, and Just a Test and more. These songs are good because they have good rythem and beat. I also like the CD because it has songs that are not the same style. I think this is the best album the beastie boys have so far. My favorite song on the CD is Three MCs and one DJ. This is my favorite track because it has good beats. This CD has twenty two tracks and all are good. If you like a few you will like them all because they all have good rythem and beat. Overall I would give it 4 out of five stars."
1,The Beastie Boys can never duplicate Paul's Boutique,"In an attempt to return to their original hip-hop, old-school style the Beasties have put together a contrived and hasty album. The beats and the lyrics of ""Hello Nasty"" really never had a chance to live up to the expectations that listeneres would have for this record. The B-Boys need to stick to their old form which was what launched them to their stardom in the first place."
5,I thought that the Cd tottally kicks some you know what!,I think the CD is really rad from what i have heard of it. It is a definate best buy and what a better way to by it than through amazon. END
3,"Clever, but losing their edge....","Well, I was ecstatic to get it, and mildly disappointed to hear it. Of course, there are many pure BB's moments that are priceless - but as an overall package, I think they've lost a bit of their edge. They didn't capture the dynamics of Paul's Boutique - the rawness of it is lacking. But who cares? If you're a die-hard BBs fan - you've gotta have it!"
2,Why do they still bother?,"Hello Nasty is another boring Beasties album, just like the two before it. Don't get me wrong, I've heard the genius in Liscense to Ill, but this is all just repetitive junk. By all means buy it and see what I mean. Song for song I can hear almost the exact same things on the Beastie's other albums, why didn't they do something original?"
4,Around half are good other half are a waste,When Hello Nasty is good its real good and I'm not just talking about Intergalatic (and I wasn't going to buy the cd just for that song I listened to parts of this album at blockbuster). The problem is that around half of the songs don't even fit into the cd they sound like they are from a different group and genre. I'll just skip through the crud..
2,"Only 3/22 songs, including Intergalactic, are good on the CD",Only three out of the 22 tracks are worth listening to. I'd pay five bucks for just the intergalactic single but its an expensive import. It's not worth buying Hello Nasty for Intergalactic because Intergalactic is all you get.
5,Lemmie Get some action from the back section,"This the best bestie boys album ever, probably better than licence to ill."
1,I only give it a rating of 0.5 and two thumbs down,"Okay, if they got rid of the grunting, the sqeaky records, and the background noise they might just sound all right. This album is nothing but repitition. It's very redundant. I suggest that you don't waste your money, and save your ears - before they start to bleed."
1,I ACTUALLY GIVE IT LESS THAN A STAR,I DONT LIKE THIS CD IT ISNT AS GOOD AS ILL COMMUNICATION AND I DIDNT REALLY LIKE THAT ONE.THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF SONGS I LIKE BUT DEFINATLY NONE ON THIS CD
2,I used to have this,"I left this cd under the seat of my car for like 3 years, during which time, it had popped out of the crappy case and got all scratched up. When I finally cleaned out my car, I threw the cd away."
3,Great for kids!,"I thought that this was a great book for my first year hunter students!!! However maybe the title is a bit misleading, as some of the kids thought that just by reading the book they were guaranteed an armfull of ribbons! However it illustrated proper turnout and horsemanship well!!"
5,Chincoteague Ponies On The Farm DVD,"Can you imagine sitting in a New York apartment and seeing live ponies playing, eating and romping on a Farm? The sounds aswell were extra wonderful. An exciting DVD for the whole family."
2,I'd rather listen to The Spoons,"When I first began listening to Bella Morte's The Quiet, I thought it was very mediocre, but not unlistenable. But then as the synth-backed mullet rock gave way to putrid ballads, I realized Bella Morte had crossed the line to pure, unadulterated badness.Yuck."
5,A pearl from Henri Nouwen,For me this book shined a powerful light on how the gospel affects those who truly receive it.
1,No quality control,"I bought this kit last week and it arrived defective right out of the box. The compressor was leaking right at the first connection out of the tank, which could not be tightened. It would not build pressure and run constantly (and loudly). I had to return it. It's impossible that such an issue would not have been found during testing, which means there was no quality control whatsoever."
3,Father's Day Gift,"My husband asked for this air compressor for his Father's Day Gift. It was listed at $284.00 at a Home Improvement store where we shop. I came home looked it up on Amazon and was amazed at the price difference, plus as a bonus they offered free shipping. I ordered it immediately.My disapointment came after my husband completely unloaded the box and found that the top of the compressor was damaged in shipping (or elsewhere). It works fine and he refused to re-package and return it."
1,Disappointment,"As advertised, the package is a great combination. I received mine as a Christmas gift. However, mine arrived and obviously had been used and returned. The compressor shroud was broken, the power cord had been unrolled, the instructions, some of the packaging, and some of the accessories were missing. I will now have to go through the arduous task of trying to get it replaced. You would think Amazon would inspect a previously opened package before reshipping."
2,"Average. ""Yoga for Dummies"" is a far better introduction","I bought this book hoping that I could get started with yoga on my own. As a beginner's introduction to yoga, it is rather unsuccessful in that it uses terminology without defining it first and has photographic illustrations that do not show the key points of the yoga positions as clearly as the drawings in ""Yoga for Dummies.""The author clearly is knowledgeable and passionate about his subject, but I don't think that these attributes serve him particularly well in an introductory text of this type."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"I think this author had good intentions--trying to title yoga postures with names that suggest the business world, and I guess in his opinion, that's where the men are who need to learn basic yoga. But, there are SO many tons of other books out there that do such a better job of introducing yoga to newbies. Maybe the problem seems to be that men are shy of yoga so they need an apparently macho introduction, but guys, go with the tried and true titles out there, or DVDs from Rodney Yee, Rod Striker, etc. The photos are poor, the model (who may be the author) is NOT a good example (OMG his handstand is completely weird) there are misspellings and misinformation. Don't worry about whether you're doing macho yoga--any old yoga is great, whether the teacher is female or male--just do some research and spend your money on a really good title--even Light on Yoga by Iyengar."
2,Don't waste your money!,This book is a joke. The examples he gives are all related to business. The book is very basic. Buy another book.
1,Diffilult Yoga for men,This book is a waste of time for anyone wanting to learn yoga. The poses are held for too long for beginners which makes them very difficult. The audio CD is very hard to follow and there is too much mystical yoga horse manure in the book. Try Yoga for Dummies or Yoga for Health by Richard Hittleman instead.
3,comedy movie,"NO PROBLEM is a laugh riot! It is funnier than Golmaal 3. I saw with my friendsand we could not stop laughing. The Comic Timing of actors like Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor is impeccable, but the surprise packet was Sushmita sen who excelled in her scenes. Her scenes were simply HILARIOUS. The public is loving this film and it is going to be a blockbuster super hit. Go watch it with your family. Specially kids will love it."
5,Dhoom (the movie),"This movie is full of suspence, drama, and humor. It is a movie that will help put you in a good mood."
3,It was okay,"This movie was alright. I did enjoy it, but I didn't think it was all that. I did find the sequel significantly better even with the glaring plot holes. Anyways, good times."
2,The Girl from Hollywood,"This attempt by Burroughs to reach beyond his Tarzan and sci-fi stories largely fails because while the plot touches on the serious issues of drug addiction and sexual exploitation, his thinly-drawn characters and melodramatic contrivances remain at the ""pulp"" level. However, Burroughs' style remains highly readable, despite the clunky dialog, and he offers a diverting look at an unsavory fringe of the silent-movie industry."
2,limited fun...,"I ordered this product for an american gladiator style afternoon of fun with my best friend. I really should have taken the other review seriously.. The inflatable ""balls"" that slide onto the poles were easy to inflate, and slid on quite easy as well.. Once we began, the inflatables kept sliding off, and were easy to basically push off with the other jousting stick. One of the jousting sticks broke in half, after one hit.. It was fun while it lasted, and that didnt last to long.. Limited fun, but fun.. Don't look for this to be a long term toy.. maybe for really really young kids, with no type of strength..."
1,Don't waste the money,"There were no instructions in the box to begin with. This item broke as soon as it was blown up and used for the first time. The round circle popped a hole in it. Plus, the blow up pieces kept falling off the ""sticks"" that are used for battling. My daughter almost hit my son with the end of the stick when that fell off."
3,major flaw,this product has one major flaw that causes it to break. the ends of the pole the balloons are on put on have caps to keep the pole from cutting the inside of the two end balloons on the inside where it is impossible to patch. the major flaw is that these caps come off easily by hand let alone inside the balloon ends. the solution is just some glue to keep the caps on.
2,Inflatable Poles,Tons of fun for about 10 minutes until the pole ripped the plactic and deflated. Then it wasn't much fun!
5,Fantastic Salad Knife,"I have had one of these knives for years. I bought it for the purpose in which it was made. This is a great knife for cutting LETTUCE. It won't cut cake because it is not made to cut cake. I just bought one for a friend.Metal knives destroy vitamins in lettuce and make the lettuce go rusty faster. Before this knife was invented it was better to tear the lettuce. Now we can cut it with the ""PERFECT LETTUCE KNIFE""!!!!"
5,One of the best books I ever read!!!,"This book is so well written. It is exciting. He is a doctor and an Earl. She is a young noble women who was cruelly treated by her family. He marries her , falls in love with her and takes care of her. I have read this book more than once and still love it. It is one of my favorites."
2,amataurish.....,"started well, then quickly became maudlin. An obvious first attempt. Weird ""father/daughter like"" relationship between the H/H and the author has a massive love affair with exclamation marks. When it got to the point of seeing 5 exclamations in a single paragraph I just gave up.not recommended."
4,The story of a good CD,"This CD is good, not great. Blew Me Off just blows me away, it's incredible. Other songs have a wee bit of country flavor, but not much, not enough to blow you up. I would recomend getting this CD if you are just in the mood to buy a CD cause you feel like buying one, but I wouldn't call it a ""Rush to the Music Store Right Away Cause it's Awesome"" CD. But it is definetly a qualitiy CD."
2,I wouldn't buy it...,"First of all, this is NOT alternative, it is some kind of country/classic rock. Trying to mix rock and country could only lead to disaster. The one good song is ""you blew me off"" the rest are just the whining tone of country music. The lyrics are not poetic at all, simply put together 'cause they rhyme, the cover is misleading, you think it's a rock band or something cooler but it's NOT. I give them one thing, they have talent which is better than a lot of bands. bare jr. should go his own way and not follow in the footsteps of his old man. Thank you and goodnight"
4,boo-tay review,"Boo-Tay Bare Jr.'s debut disc is an excellent dose of Country-Rock madness. ""Nothin' Better To Do"" should of gotten tons of radio play, but again the programers all over this fine land seem to be blind when there is good music floating around. ""You Blew Me Off"", a alt.rock hit I can't believe it, with it's Gary Glitter Rock & Roll Pt.2 mixed in with it. Other great songs on this disc are ""Tobacco Spit"", ""Patty McBride"", ""Loveless"", ""I Hate Myself"" and ""Why Won't You Love Me"". Bobby Bare should feel very proud of his son, Here's hoping Jr. can continue making some more good music in the future."
4,Yardbirds Blues,"The Best of the Yardbirds was released on February 22, 1994. Not all of the group hits are on this cassette and three songs on the cassette charted. At time the songs sound like hard rock blues or just blues. Still I enjoyed listening to the cassette. The Best of the Yardbirds gets a B+.Side OneFor Your Love#6 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesHeart Full of Soul#9 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesShapes of Things#11 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 SinglesYou're A Better Man Than IB Side of Shape of ThingsEvil Hearted YouSide TwoThe Train Kept A Rollin'I Ain't Got YouI Wish You WouldSmokestack Lightning"
3,NO WAY THEIR GREATEST HITS,"NINE SONGS BY THE YEARDBIRDS, BUT NOT THEIR GREATEST HITS BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. A GOOD BUDGET CD OF YARDBIRDS SONGS, BUT NOT VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND NO LINER NOTES."
2,hard to find a quality print,"If your looking for a decent print of the 'ol John Wayne Lonestar Films, I wouldnot recommend this West Gate DVD. You are probably better off with the Platinum / Echo Bridge series."
2,Bad fit,"The shape of the socks are horrible. The elastic opening fits around the ankle just fine, but then the rest of the sock just balloons around the feet. It's not shaped to fit the foot at all. My daughter refuses to wear these, but I can't return them because we threw away the packaging right away. Bad buy."
4,Not so sharp picture,"I have more Atlona products and I'm verry satisfied of them. But this product have little bit bloory picture, it is not like other Atlona products. But still it is much better than the other products on the market that I have try."
1,"Not worthy of ""toilet reading""","Reads like it was researched and written by an 8th grader. Charles Cullen may have murdered repeatedly, but more grueseome is the author's grisly butchering of the english language. I can't imagine this actually passed under the nose of anyone who seriously calls themselves a copy editor (truly about a glaring mistake in punctuation, syntax, or grammar per page), and I have no idea why even the most obscure subsidiary/branch of Penguin would put their name anywhere on this disaster. Yet another mystery is why Barnes & Noble continues to display this dreck so prominently on their ""New Releases"" display. I mean, T.V. Guide was a new release that week, and is Shakespeare by comparison. The only two redeeming qualities are 1) it points out that lawyers suck, which is incontrovertible fact and 2) it does indeed make a fine drink coaster."
1,Waste of money!,Right out of the newspapers and inaccurate to boot! Just an effort to make a quick buck. Book is so thin that it makes a good coaster though!
1,Absolutely Awful and Inaccurate,"I was appalled at this book. Inaccuracy after inaccuracy, including self contradictory ""facts"", only about 20 pages actually dedicated to Charles Cullen (the rest being a survey of other serial killers, the plight of the nursing industry and other fillers), overly sensational prose and obviously no research whatsoever makes this book no more than a sleazy attempt at a quick buck. What facts there are have appeared in the newspaper, so go to Google news, search on ""Charles Cullen Nurse"" and save yourself 10 bucks."
1,A frustrating mess -- does not merit even one star,"It is difficult for me to believe that this ""author"" has actually written (and published) other books. This book is supposed to be about Charles Cullen, nurse serial killer, but instead is a way-too-long (at just over 100 pages), poorly written diatribe against the sloppiness of our health care system in patrolling its hospitals, nursing homes, etc. for suicidal, homicidal employees. It took me so long to slog through the grammatical and spelling errors, the disorganized, redundant chapters, and the obviously slapped together ""bibliography"", that I wondered how George Mair had the gall to offer this mess to a publisher, and moreover, why I was wasting my time attempting to get any sense out it! If you ask me, the real crime here is that Chamberlain Bros. would publish such humbug and ask people to pay for it."
1,put this book to sleep,may be the worst true-crime book I've ever read. probably was written and edited overnight.
2,Introductory but out of date,"This book is at a very beginning level, telling you how to use the macro recorder,defining a variable (""where programs store values""), defining what ""calling"" a procedure means etc. If you are at this beginning level, the book is excellent EXCEPT it is out of date. For example, the menu arrangement described in this book for inserting a module sheet is different if you use Excel '97. The dialog sheet is used here for designing dialog boxes, a method replaced with UserForms in Excel '97. So although intended to be a very handholding approach, for users of Excel '97 it is no longer so straigtforward. Probably John Walkenbach's ""Microsoft Excel 2000 Power Programming"" is more useful, but unfortunately at a more advanced level."
4,Great Book for starters,"This is a very good book to begin programming in Excel VBA, but not to end if you will. The book sort of gives you a push and YOU! have to then take the ball and run with it. The book is analogous to how a mother bear chases her cubs away once they are big enough to take care of themselves. The cubs, though with enough skills to survive, are still left with new and open possibilities before them. The reason why is that most of the examples are too easy, making them too unrealistic for the real world. The other is that the book is based on an older Excel version. This book is really great for those people who are scared of programming and want to make the transition, but are not sure of what road to take."
2,Disappointing,"Numerous examples and suggestions in the book were not accurate using Excel 97. For a self-paced, self-taught learner, look elsewhere."
4,good,"Seemed to take an excessively long time to arrive, but the book was worth the wait. Good resource for planning a trip."
3,Not as pictured.,"NOTE: Items pictured appear MUCH larger than they actually are. What you are buying is a one ounce ""TRAVEL SPRAY"". I have purchased the 3 oz.perfume pictured many times before in a department store. I didn't even realize they sold such a small - albiet very cute - version. Bottom line buyer beware - 1) Read the product description 2) If it looks like a really good deal, it probably is... On the upside, very quick delivery."
3,good service,I received this product in a timely manner and in good shape;however I had been given this as a gift last year and loved it. This bottle did not smell the same so I was disappointed by that. Not sure why but I don't like the way this one smells.But I did receive the order quickly and in good shape!
2,disappointed,"well i wasnt happy with this product but thats me i didnt like the way it smelled,but i wouldnt say not to buy it cuz someone else might love it but it smell like roses to me to much"
5,My dog LOVES these.,"We can never find any toys that our German Shepherd won't destroy within 6 hours. These hoses are the only things that survive. Takes her at least a month to wreck them. It's pretty much all we buy now. Great quality, good price, good shipping speed. Doggy and I are happy."
3,Not as tough as advertised.,"When my cavalier spaniel was a puppy he was going through chew toys like water. We bought this hoping it would last. While it lasted better than other toys (a week or 2 instead of days) he learned how to make fast work of these as well. He loves these thing so I get them occasionally but he still rips a hole down to the stuffing in less than 1 week. Bottom line is if your dog is a chewer they will make fast work of these, If not they will last."
2,A great band at its worst,"I've been a Damned fan for 20 years, and I find this release appalling. The Damned went through numerous lineup changes between 1977 and 1986. This 1988 show is a reunion of two of the stronger lineups. But it sounds like they didn't rehearse at all. The skills of guitarist Brian James, who lights the band's debut album on fire, have seriously diminished by the time of this concert. The other members put in a listless, bored effort that sounds like they really don't want to be there. To check out the Damned, try Damned Damned Damned, Machine Gun Etiquette, and The Black Album, to hear a band progress from top-notch high-energy punk, to a completely unique mix of punk and unpretentious fun progressive rock."
2,Not for me,"Some may find this weight loss tape effective and it may be, but I won't ever know because after listening to it five times (once a day for five days) I just couldn't stand his voice."
1,Thule 881's work quite well,"I've used the Thule 881 with tie downs about a half dozen times now and have no complaints. I have the rails mounted on top of my Wrangler, and the 881s on top of that, so my kayak is pretty high. To get it up I set the nose on top of the back of the Jeep top, then grab the rear T handle on my kayak. It's a simple matter to get it slid into place from there. I'm a little concerned that the rest pads of the 881 will break because I bend them some when mounting like this, but so far they are holding up."
5,Love this clock,"This is the second of the same clock we've owned, the first meeting its demise after 6 years and a nasty file during home construction. My wife and I looked at dozens of clocks, but this simply fits us and our space in great fashion. Battery life is great and it keeps good time."
5,Beautiful,Very comforting after the loss of my brother. Pretty much listen to it daily even when I am traveling. Very beautiful voice and as a Catholic I totally relate to the lyrics.
3,Linda Shows Her Stuff!,"This nifty little Australian chiller allows our favorite vomit spewer to ACT! Linda Blair plays a nurse in a COMA-type hospital where patients check in, but don't check... well, you get the cliche. Some certain doctors are performing evil deeds, but not necessarily of the supernatural calliber. The story keeps the events in realistic situations and Blair wisely underplays the terror of what she's uncovering as the outsider. As she learns more of the hospitals secrets, the dark corridors and cold personel make for a truly unnerving setting. The films climax definitely had me biting my nails as our heroine tries to escape once her cover is blown. With the exception of a brief nude scene with Blair (tisk tisk), this is a higer end made-for-television type thriller I wish I could see more of on Blair's resume. Bottom line... creepy, quick moving and satisfying."
5,Woodland Camo BDU Pants,"Good pants, use for guard duty drill weekends. Best and lowest price I could find on internet. Received shipment very quickly after order. Exact specs and pattern as advertised. Highly recommend."
1,"Never recieved item, lost my money","I ordered a pair of xs bdu pants for my son for Christmas. When they arrived I noticed they were too small. I called the number on the invoice and a very nice lady told me to return the pants and they would exchange them for a larger size. I did this and then never received the larger pants, its been nearly a month. They wont respond to my email. I am not sure what to do now other than write this review and hope I get someones attention. I dont have the original invoice so I dont have a phone # to call.S. Poe"
3,Not what you expect,"This is not the coffee that you buy in big bins at your store. It's some special flavor they've created that's not a big favorite with me. Tastes kind of burnt, but it's brown and it's hot, what else can you want in the morning."
4,Perlman outstanding,"I have become a fan of Perlman over the years, and I particularly love the Tchaikovsky concerto, so of course I had to have this one. I bought this disc a few days after hearing Perlman perform this concerto live with the Boston Symphony under Ozawa. This live disc captured perfectly the feeling I had sitting in Symphony Hall hearing this concerto. Perlman was not flawless in concert, neither is he on this disc. But his knowledge and feel for the Russian flavor of the piece is uncanny, and his technique is breathtaking. The orchestra could have been captured a bit better. Perlman's encores on this disc are absolutely unbelievable. If you're buying the Tchaikovsky concerto try Perlman's earlier recording with Philadelphia Orch. under Ormandy, as I think the orchestra is heard much better."
2,Mediocre Tchaikovsky ...,"This Tchaikovsky Recording is a fair one. Perlman has better recordings; namely his performance with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The first movement sounds a bit too rushed and slightly ""showman-like"" rather than musician like. The Bazzini is slightly scratchy and rushed!! Perlman's pizzacato is also mushed and hard to hear. Listen to Maxim Vengerov's recording of the Bazzini... It's the best I've heard to date."
5,My butt is super sexy!!,"I was a little skeptical on how intense this would be since I have completed Turbofire and Insanity. This dvd rocked! The intensity was high and satisfying. I was dripping sweat EVERY time. My legs and butt burned insanely. It was all worth it. My buns look great, my hips are super streamlined, my lower back is defined, and my legs are shapely and sexy. Jillian keeps the workout interesting and unique. Love it! Love it!"
3,It's a GOOD workout,"I am impressed with the intensity and targeting of this workout. No doubt - by keeping up with it, it will continue to do exactly as she promises.... However, if you are one who likes transitional time and cues between moves, and ""form coaching"" i'd skip this one and go straight for P90x. Everything about the transition and coaching is better. I've heard her other DVDs are better for that, so I'm a bit sorry this is my first one.The other downside is as others have said. This is not a motivational workout...she definitely seems a bit jaded here. Most of the way through the workout I wish I could tell her to ""leave it on the field, sweetheart!"" when she complains about twitter etc.All that said - I commend Michaels on a tough workout, and one that I will continue - because all in all its what we make of it, right?"
5,Advanced!! My all time fav,I'm 21 years old in great shape female. I always need super advanced workouts. I never thought I'd get through the first week of this the first time I used it. It's been over 8 months and I've been on level three and every now and then will re-cycle them and still get sore from level one! Which I love. I just use heavier weights. This DEF lifted my butt. Still my all time fav butt and leg DVD.
5,Excellent,I love this workout. It really works on the targeted areas. Consistency is the key to seeing results. The video also takes into consideration beginners and those who maybe more advanced.
4,jillian michaels killer buns and thighs,Good dvd. She is a killer! Lots of different type of workouts for every level. I was a personal trainer for four years and I even learned some new moves. Love this CD
5,Geting fit.,My daughter and I really love these dvds. I eventually want to get more Jillian dvds to add to my collection.
5,oops she did it again,"speaking of oops.. here's something funny. i had been sick and thought i was ordering jillian's new kickboxing dvd (not that kickboxing is easy.. but i thought a weightless workout would be the way to get back in the groove). So i laughed out loud when I realized I had ordered KILLER BUNS AND THIGHS. just saying that makes me say ""ouch!""So out of a rut of not working out from being sick, i popped in the dvd and started with level one. On this first day, I remember saying to myself at least 5 times during the workout, ""she is crazy""But THANK GOD for Jillian Michaels and her craziness!! My butt and thighs are more toned in just a week. no joke. I feel it in my butt and see it in my thighs.And when I don't feel like putting KILLER BUNS AND THIGHS in my line up, I look at the cover and think- if my backside can look like Jillian's does here.. it's worth the pain. PLUS no push-ups!! haha"
3,Good video but VOD download needs menu function,"I downloaded this video as a video on demand rental for my wife. She likes it a lot and finds it challenging (in a good way), but some videos really need a menu to help navigate and this is one of them. Since the video has three levels, if you want to do the second or third level you have to keep trying to skip forward using trial and error until you find the other levels. It helps that she wears different colors for each level (since you can just look for a change of color to know it's another level)."
4,Get ready for a slimmer lower body!,"I have done this twice, luckily second time around was slightly easier. Feel it almost immediately in the lower body. Jillian is a great trainer. She keeps me motivated and focused. Only on level 1 - hoping I see big changes! Only negative was the plank work bothered my wrists alot but I am hoping with times comes strength and endurance."
5,Hardest Workout DVD,"This is the hardest workout DVD I've ever done, and definitely my favorite. Again, VERY sweaty and painful, but extremely rewarding. You won't regret buying this DVD if you're willing to tough it out and do the full workouts."
5,Jillian is THE BEST!!!!,"This is one of the best exercise videos that I have ever done. I considered myself very fit, I've been exercising regularly for the past 20 years and this kicked my butt! I love that. Jillian always delivers. I have all of her videos and they are all great but this is the best for butt and thighs -- try it, you won't be dissapointed! I can't recommend it highly enough -- 5 big stars all the way!"
4,Exactly what I expect from a Jillian Michaels workout!,"I've purchased her workout dvds before, and I really like her method. This was no disappointment! It's a great workout, and I felt it after day one. It really targets the lower body, and I can't wait to see the results! Very pleased with this purchase!"
5,Great product.,I am really enjoying the videos that I have gotten. They are helping me loose the weight that I want to loose.
5,Best Butt Video...hands down!,"I have purchased everything from ""8 minute buns"" to devoting myself to the thigh master, and I can honestly say that Jillian's video is hands down the best lower body workout I have ever done. After 3 days of working out to the dvd I felt a major difference and could tell I was really working my gluts and quads...The music is very catchy and all in all I rate this with 5 stars!!"
3,Not quite what I thought,"While this is a good DVD for targeted work, I have found most of the moves in other videos I have. So, when I do a video for a ""full workout"" I'm doing the same things with the benefit of working other muscle groups. I do like her videos, though."
3,good workout but troubles getting it to play,I bought this dvd to try out and I like the workouts but I cant seem to get it to play in my xbox. So I try to play it on my dvd player on the computer and it will randomly decide to stop playing or not play at all. I am not sure if its the dvd or just my laptop.
3,Great butt workout But kills knees,"This is a really super workout for the butt but theres some problems.. I have done jillians NMTZ and BSBM and Shred--i exercise 5 times a week for about 1 hour at a time..On this DVD.I got through level one which i felt was difficult but i got through it, went ahead to do level 2, a little too much for me, my knees started to hurt so i stopped..I also started to get bored. So i think doing only section of this at a time is best! The next day my butt was sore, it works.I dont like how Jillian talked in this, very annoying and not inspiring at all...Like she had some drinks before she did this.Anyway its a good workout for the butt just be careful with the knees, u dont want to wind up having knee surgery before your 40."
3,Prefer Ripped in 30 Series,"While it is a decent workout, it incorporates moves from the other videos and does not seem to have the interval training component. As a supplement to your regular training it's good but, having tried this dvd, I prefer the total body workout."
5,great addition to workout library!,"I work out a lot and found this video to be very challenging. It has plyometrics, cardio, weights, and intense leg and butt exercises. For me it's the perfect length, not too long or short. Highly recommended!!!"
1,It won't play,"was all excited to try this but the dvd won't play, i think i got a lemon. Be nice if i could get a new dvd that works so i can get my shape back."
1,DVD did not work!!!,"I would not put any stars at all, but couldn't write this review if I didn't. My dvd did not work at all!"
3,results in 1 month,"I tried the 1st 2 levels and it was too easy. Level 3 is challenging enough, it gives you a good workout...my only negative is the bubbly interaction between the 3 ladies.....i followed someones advise and I mute my Tv. IT WORKS."
4,Good product,"I have enjoyed all of her dvd workout surprisingly, and this even came early. No problem with the dvd and the workout was just an extra to my main workout and it is quite a nice extra."
1,Jillian michaels killer buns and thighs,Would like a new copy. DVD says disk is dirty and doesn't work!! Cleaned DVD player and ran other disks all of which work.
4,Thought I was in shape until...,"I thought I was in pretty good shape until I did this video. Jillian kicks butt! I did level one and boy, did I get a run for my money. This is pretty comprehensive in terms of a butt workout and I like how she incorporates yoga moves. Your core is also stimulated throughout level 1 (and probably the other levels too) so you get that added benefit. I can't wait to graduate to level 2. Really glad I bought this. The only thing I don't like is the need for hand weights...I need to get some but you can just use soup cans as a substitute."
5,great video,"This is a great video to work out with. I like all of Jillian Michael's videos, a lot more convenient than going to the gym."
4,Pretty good!,"Pretty decent buns and thighs workout! Started w/ the level 1, obviously, which had a good mix of basics and more advanced, harder exercises, with options to add/decrease difficulty in them. This really is a buns & thighs video, with a little bit of lower leg, and also some core (mostly due to assocation to said buns). I mixed this workout I was already doing, and was a little sore after initially doing it. My mother did it with me one day (she usually just walks for exercise), and she said she really felt it the next day, so I would say it really works for beginners. I really like the mix of large movements, pulsing movements, isometrics, and balances to vary it up and give different areas of the body rest, etc. Overall decent video to add to the mix for those that are regular exercises, and very good for beginners looking for a nice challenge."
5,Awesome,I really enjoy the variety of exercise techniques. She does chat alot but that is why we have a mute button.
5,Great workout,"Loved it... This was a terrific video.. I love Jillian Michaels and this was no disappointment. I would highly recommend it but I would start with her Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism"
2,Watch your knees,"I own most of Jillian's videos, but this one puts a lot of stress on the knees. Will not be using this again. Of note I do work out at boot camps a minimum of 3 days a week and also use videos, but not this one."
5,Coming from a males P.O.V,"This is definitely a great leg video if you can't make it to the gym. I just started yesterday and this was not easy! My butt and thighs are crazy sore right now but I am looking forward to having a ""titanium"" lower body. Women may be in the video but it is tough enough for a male to use, we all know Jillian isn't a softy."
3,Killer Buns and Thighs,"This DVD is HARD. I'm sure the results are good, but its not easy to do. I'm only at level 1."
3,Review Jillian Michaels Killer Buns & Thighs,"I recently purchased Jillian Michaels Killer Buns & Thighs. So far I have only done level 1 and it's ok. The most annoying thing about the workout was listening to JM go on and on about people posting comments on facebook and twitter....PS don't appreciate the profanity. I think if you spend money on buying a product, you are entitled to comment.I'm in Cape Town, so had to spend extra cost on shipping and VAT. I enjoyed the 30 Day Shred workouts and thought this would be a great addition to my workout routine but I am put off by the fact that JM uses profanity and uses God's name. I think I'll just mute her and play my own music while I work out."
2,Not so much,"I am a fan of Jillian, but I have to say, I really don't like this workout. It has a lot of complicated cardio moves-which is usually a good thing-but not when you're just looking to sculpt your buns and thighs. There's a ton of jumping around, which is usually good because of range of motion but just getting the moves down is frustrating. I feel like I'm in a dance class or something. For anyone who lives in an apartment building and is conscientious about your neighbors below you, don't get this dvd. What happened to weights and different forms of squats?"
5,Jillian is my new favorite!,"I just started the Ripped in 30 DVD and I have been adding this one to my workout and it is great!! My saddlebag area and my hamstrings are an area that I am looking to get more definition and this DVD delivers those excercises. I am already seeing the changes that I was looking for so I am sold. People need to quit worrying about how Jillian's voice sounds and just do the DVD. All that matters is that you get results. Get it, Do it, you'll love it!"
5,Previous P90X User,"I was previously a P90x user. But, working full-time as a paramedic, and a full-time mommy, the P90x workouts were too long. I needed something to kick my ass in a shorter amount of time. I read several reviews prior to buying Killer Buns & Thighs (KB&T), and it seemed like lots of consumers spoke highly of the DVD. Well, I am 2 weeks into Level 1, and it is kicking my ass!!! Thank You Ms. Michaels! I actually like her workout better than the leg workout from P90x. KB&T is shorter, but it is constant, non-stop kick your butt workouts (Keep in mind I have only done level 1).. I can't wait to get to level 2 & 3!!! P90x was long, lots of breaks, and took FOREVER. I also appreciate that the KB&T seem to focus on women's trouble areas. So I am already seeing a more feminine sculpture vs. P90x ""Man Muscles!"" I would recommend this to anyone who is seriously trying to get into crazy, awesome physical shape!! Again, Thank You Ms. Michaels!"
5,WOW!,"I don't know why but I wasn't expecting a workout this hard -- especially on Level 1. So, I popped this in after I had just completed Jillian's Kettlebell workout Level 1 (which is awesome btw) and I was dripping sweat after I finished it. If you want killer buns and thighs...oh yeah, get this one. PHEW! Love It!"
4,"Awesome Work-Out, Annoying Background Model","I agree with most of the other reviewers in that Killer Buns & Thighs does not disappoint. I was a little hesitant to pre-order the DVD simply because I enjoy full body work-outs. In true Jillian fashion you not only work your legs and booty until the muscles are quivering, but she also gives you a solid dose of cardio! Phew!My only complaint, as one other reviewer has pointed out, is that Natalie continues her cheating ways from 30 Day Shred. I'm also not a fan of her commentary to Jillian. I'll chalk it up to my ""work-out personality."" I like to show up, shut-up and sweat...bring back Basheera indeed! I also don't want to be doing a better job/working harder than the bad-ass version model (Natalie).All in all, I would recommend it! The work-outs are too good, and eventually, once I learn the moves, I can just watch it on mute."
5,WOW!,It's been awhile since I tried one of Jillian's workouts and I have to admit that I was suprised by the difficulty of this one. I consider myself to be at the intermediate or advanced level and I found myself with shaking legs and dripping sweat on level one! Totally awesome!
3,ok product,"I think Jillian always does a great job coming up with creative workouts, but this one for some reason doesn't challenge me as much as I was hoping...still a good DVD for different ideas"
5,Great workout,"I love almost all of Jillian's workouts, and this one does not disappoint. It is not a beginner workout- so be ready for a GOOD workout. The level 3 workout is intense, but worth the sweat!"
4,Work that butt!,"I have a love/hate relationship with Jillian....she has efficient workouts, but her comments get old fast (but that goes for all her videos). This video is good, has different levels, and you will feel your workout the next day. The workouts are longer than 30 minutes- more like 40-45 minutes."
5,Perfect!,I have gotten many great compliments on this CD when I use it for my yoga classes! It is a perfect accent to my practice.
2,Not for me,"I'm a yoga instructor who was very disappointed in this CD as far as it being a music to practice to. The music for me felt all wrong for my own practice - the sequencing, the pace of the music, the song selection by Windam House. It felt more like easy listening music, but not quite right for a yoga practice (even a slow flow practice). For me, the music has to fade into the back ground while I'm practicing - this just grates on my nerves. My classes didn't care for the music and complained that the music was distracting for them as well. I recommend Planet Yoga (both CD's are wonderful- Disc 1 for faster paced and Disc 2 for meditation or slow flow) and Yoga Rhythm.However, for just playing at home while cleaning, or just relaxing it's alright. I don't think it's anything to get excited over."
5,good for practice and sleep,I found this a great cd for practice as it allows me to block distracting noises from outside my apartment and focus on what I am doing. It is good to relax with at night when I have trouble going to sleep.
1,This Book is the Worst Textbook EVER,"I have seen many textbooks in my lifetime but this was, by far, the worst I have ever seen! It is extremely outdated and there is no index in the book. Many of the facts were based on statistics from the 80's so I felt like I was learning things that are no longer correct. They have updated the edition numbers but not the facts and stats that are used. Unless you are required to have this book for a class, don't waste your money on this. If you HAVE to get it, just get a used one as cheap as you can because chances are you will not want to keep it after the class."
5,Interesting read,The book is very interesting and the chapters are not too long!! The main points are made within the introduction of the chapters!! The information is useful and it mentions most demographics and how they affect women in society!
5,Fromm boils it down to this:,"will you fall into the Western, mechanistic, and capitalistic mode of Having, or evolve into the perennial Being taught by those whom Fromm calls the Masters of Living? Bearing mind that the two can overlap (one has only to think of Jesus' advice to possess as though one possessed nothing), Fromm sets out the polarity well for purposes of psychological study. Ought to be taught in school..."
4,Nicely done,"This a very appealing book for teens. A young girl who find herself in a castle, with sister, brother, father and step mother. All of them have very different personalities. The oldest girl keeps a diary of everything, because she want to be a writer better than her father. All while looking for love, specially the love of a well to do man.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""and ""Trouble in the Elf City""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
4,"Deserves a second, closer reading","Mortimer Adler (How to Read a Book) recommends reading a book three times to delve deeper into what an author is trying to say through their story. I just finished reading this for the first time. This really deserves a closer read now that I ""get"" what happens with Rose at the end. (No spoilers here).I'd seen the movie a while ago and it didn't really do anything for me. I watched the movie again last night and still didn't like it. Sure, the movie was OK, but I don't think it really got to the heart of the story.I feel the author is really trying to say something here that is summarized at the end during the discussion between Simon and Cassandra about her father's book. This book is a puzzle in itself on purpose. It is not just about a love story, or a child growing up. Dodie Smith is trying to say something about the creative process itself. It will take effort on the reader's part to tease out all the meaning that is layered into the story."
5,Wonderful book,"After reading the latest reviews on Amazon I felt obliged to write my own review.This is a wonderful book. It reads very easily and the story is a joy to follow. I love Cassandra and her very matter-of-fact love lorn ways. Rose is the character that you want to hate but just can't. All the characters are enjoyable and life like.Of course, this is a book for younger readers. I still feel it is a very good read for any age. I read it in one sitting and loved every minute of it. I have since re-read it twice and I still love it.I have heard that this is also one of JK Rowlings favorite books as a child, and that it inspired her to write.High praise indeed.Please read it for yourself and don't let those without imagination turn you away from it."
5,One of the best books that I have ever read...( 5+ stars),"I loved this. I absolutely loved it. The lead character Cassandra was wonderful. She was so smart and romantic. She made me laugh and even cry a little. This has to be one of the most touching stories I have ever had the pleasure to read. I finished this book in a little over one sitting and I was so upset when it was over.I Capture the Castle is extremely romantic, yet very appropriate for young girls...not just older ones. This is a definite keeper. I would recommend it in an instant."
5,I Capture the Castle,"This book was extremely inciteful and readable and contained fabulous characterization. I was enthralled from the first sentence to the last by Cassandra's adventures and misadventures. I would recommend it to anyone. In someways comic, and in some tragic, it is always lyrical and beautiful."
2,"no, thanks","okay, personally, i really didn't like this novel. Sorry Dodie, but i just coldn't get past the first 7 chapters...it got really boring. i guess you could say that i shouldn't base my review on only 7 chapters...but seriously, the fact that i couldn't finish the book is the reason why i felt obliged to write down that i didn't llike tho book. i realize that many people loved this book, which is great..i just didn't. thats just me."
2,so not worth it!,"its about this teenager, cassandra, she lives in this romantic castle but her family is increadibly poor. her father used to be a writer but is suffering from writers block and cassandra, who wants to be a writer, starts a journal to improve her skills as shes not suposed to be very good. then this rich family moves near them with two men. cassandra's sister and the rest of the family see them as a way out and rose(the sister) sets out to grab herself a man and some money.its really not all that. i read it because i heard about it in another book but i was very disapointed. the books long without much story and the characters are without charisma. the only thing i can say for it is that it does have some rare points of good description.i'm warning you, if you want a good story, whether your into action, horror, comedy, fantasy or even romance, this will not be it!"
3,The Movie Was Better!,"I suppose that I would have liked the book more, had I read it first instead of watching the movie first. I think this book lacked details that I look for in a good book. I did not care much for the time or place that it took place. I felt the book had a slow beginning. That was enough for my husband to quit reading it. Several of my book club members could not get past the fist sentence! As you read on, however, you find that the story gets better as it goes. There is so much drama between the two sisters in this book! It makes it really good! It has some laughs and some serious parts. There were some parts in this book that my book club members disagreed about as far as what Smith was trying to get across to the reader. Overall, I would say that it is worth a try, but I would not read it again. I would, however, watch the movie again!"
4,I was disappointed,"I think I started this book with my expectations too high. After all the glowing reviews I really expected a book that would grab me and not put me down, or at least one that would make it onto my bookshelf as a favorite. It's a good book. The characters are interesting and involving. Maybe if I'd read it when I was a teenager the unrequited love angst (well-written though it was) would not have put me off so much. But from my middle-aged perspective it let the book down. So my recommedation is to give this book to your teenage daughters and nieces, and to take the glowing reviews with a grain of salt."
4,Extremely Enchanting,"When I first found this book I was on vacation, looking for something to read. I was drawn to the book, maybe by its interesting cover, or the fact that it has been praised by the author of my favorite book series, Harry Potter. After picking up the book and reading the back cover I thought, why not, sounds good enough.I started reading the book and yes, it was a little slow at first. But usually once I start a book, even a seemingly boring one, I try to finish it. I can't be exactly sure when I really started getting into the book, perhaps it was the introduction of the Cottons, but soon after I couldn't stop. After I finished, I recommended it to everyone I knew.Cassandra is a character, in my opinion, many girls can relate to; mainly being in the shadow of an older sibling, and living in a castle was a fantasy of everyone at some point or anotherI highly recommend this book to teens and old alike. It's an enchanting coming-of-age book and I give it my highest praise."
4,Captured my Heart,"I Capture the Castle was a truly delightful book. Written in a journal format, in the voice of the seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain, this book captures the angst of first love. It is hard to resist a book whose opening line has Cassandra writing while sitting in a sink. The setting of a ramshackle castle in the English countryside adds a certain whimsy to the story. It is not your usual run of the mill coming of age story. Cassandra's view of the adult world is also seasoned with a hard dose of reality. The story of Cassandra and Rose's sisterly love is also very moving. The book is a little dated, and the naiveté of Cassandra sometimes takes one by surprise, but don't let that stop you from reading this book, because you will miss a lovely story."
5,This is a great book,"When I started reading this book, I thought that it would be another castle novels, which i HATE. But as soon as I turned page 19 I was hooked, and this book really caught my attention. Cassandra and her sister are two very interesting girls, and the two guys they meet are really cool. I did a book report on it and, I have to say, I finished the book more than a month before it was due! THis is a must read for someone that loves a cute love story!!!"
1,i couldnt get through the whole book...,"i capture the castle interested me because it had such good reviews. i decided to buy it in paperback, and got it at a low price in a local bookshop. i opened it and found that cassandra's journal really dragged on, with all these details about her life in the castle. i couldnt really find anything very interesting in it. im sure that people who enjoy very placid and idyllic books would like i capture the castle, but it is not for me."
3,Not Riveting,"After reading Pride and Prejudice, this book does not hold a candle. I personally do not enjoy reading a book written as a diary. I like to feel a part of the story and not on the outside as an observer. If you are in the mood for a romantic story, choose Pride and Prejudice. The characters in Castle were not well-developed. I never cared about any of them. The ending leaves something to be desired."
4,Excellent!,"I haven't read the book, so I can't compare it to the film (usually a pointless exercise, anyway). Watch the film!One small criticism: I love Bill Nighy, but I think he's a little shaky in this. He's better playing extroverted characters."
5,Funny and Absorbing Coming of Age Tale,"In the 1930s teenaged Cassandra lives in a dilapidated old castle in the English countryside with her older sister, Rose, her younger brother, Thomas, her eccentric father, Mortmain, and his bride/muse, Topaz, and of course, the former maid's son, Stephen. The supposed romance of living in a castle is quickly debunked and the reader sees all is not well - the father has not even attempted to work for years and the family is on the verge of starvation. The action really starts when their landlord dies and ownership passes to his two young and handsome American nephews.This novel is told in the form of Cassandra's journals, and very endearingly conveys her experiences trying to deal with her constricted existence, her bizarre family, and first love. I could not put this down and thoroughly enjoyed it... however, I could not help the occasional thought that another author would have made this story side-splittingly funny."
4,Cassandra is one of the all-time great characters,"If you've ever thought it would be cool to live in a castle, this book is a must-read. It's romantic without being at all sentimental, and quite funny to boot. I thought it sagged a little in the middle, but things definitely picked up toward the final quarter. And Cassandra just killed me -- what a fun, bright narrator!"
5,A book that makes me want to write.,"One of my favorite coming of age stories. I like novels written as journals, because the characters and their stories become so much more personal. Cassandra's journal makes me want to write."
5,"Two sisters, two brothers in a falling-to-pieces castle.","My mother had an original bookclub edition of this and I have it, earnestly annotated in my adolescent hand. My sisters now have copies collected at book sales over the past 30 years. My daughter loves it now. Seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain wants to be a writer and fills three journals with the tale of a year in '30's England...her writer-father in the middle of an unexplicable dry period, her step-mother Topaz who ""communes with nature"" in the nude, her beautiful but discontented sister Rose, Stephen the young hired-man and the exciting American brothers who inherit the great house in the neighborhood. ""Which do you like better, Jane Austen with a touch of Charlotte Bronte, or Charlotte Bronte with a touch of Jane Austen?"" is the kind of question the sisters ponder until real life becomes much more interesting. A lovely book that hasn't aged a bit."
3,The Twilight of its day?,"While enjoyable, this book is overrated. I can only assume it is still surfing along on the momentum of its original popularity."
2,"*groan, sigh*","My best friend lent me this book promising it would be great. Don't tell her, but I hated it. I was going to give it one star, but I must admit the author does a good job at painting the characters and bringing you into the story. The first half of it is sooo boring, but by the second half you can't stop reading it. And then the ending is totally unfufilling! I was soo frustrated like, ""What? This is the end? That's what happens? I hate this book!"" Well, you might like it if you like romances, but sorry, I'm into sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure. Mystery, too. Don't buy it, just get it from the library and if you like it buy it."
2,Not captured enough,"I know plenty of people will disagree with me, but I felt this book was a bit too predicable. I must say, I've finished reading Lord of the Rings, and after that experience, I don't think any book will be able to live up to it.I Capture the Castle was interesting enough to keep reading on, but it took quite a while to get into. It was predictable, like a historical drama. The characters were charming at first, but then they grew annoying.The ending left me a bit baffled. It left a little to be desired, and I felt it was rushed. It's like looking at the menu, and something sounds and looks appealing- but then when you taste it, it hasn't lived up to your expectations. But you hope to adapt a taste for it later. And when you don't, you're left with disappointment."
4,"How to get the really complete ""Complete Recordings""","As other reviewers have commented, this album is great (and is the compilation which in its original LP form triggered the whole British blues boom that lies at the foundation of much modern rock), but you should really get the Complete Recordings instead. However, you will also want the newly discovered alternate take of Traveling Riverside Blues, which is on this CD but missing from the ""complete"" set. The solution is to get Elijah Wald's book ""Escaping the Delta"", which gives a fascinating analysis of Johnson's work within the context of his time and environment. Apart from being essential reading for any Johnson fan, it comes with a bonus CD that includes the missing track. Problem solved!"
5,Unreleased Track A Revelation,"The previously unreleased early take of ""Traveling Riverside Blues"" will be a revelation for serious devotees of Johnson, since it shows him in a markedly spontaneous, uncertain and vulnerable state that's winning in its lack of audience-minded effect. This is Johnson thinking out loud about the song, its personal meaning and its communicative potential, exploring how to merge all these perspectives for maximum impact on a waiting world. Poignant and electrifying."
3,Get The Complete Recordings instead,"The music on this CD is great, no doubt. These songs are all classics. But you would be doing much better to purchase The Complete Recordings instead. There are simply too many songs missing from this CD to make it a great purchase. Out of Robert Johnson's 29 recorded songs, only 17 are present here. Absolute classics like ""I Believe I'll Dust My Broom"", ""Sweet Home Chicago"", ""Steady Rollin' Man"", and ""From Four Until Late"" are missing. Do yourself a favor and purchase The Complete Recordings."
5,The best transcriptions of the Robert Johnson recordings,"I've been listening to various releases of the Robert Johnson recordings and these reissues (this disk and the companion Vol 2)of the Columbia transcriptions are by far the best. At the cost of leaving in more of the hiss and scratches, the timbre of Johnson's voice has more depth, is less muffled, and sounds much more like a real human voice. The character of the voice and the nuances in inflections are more readily apparent. Of course, not the quality of modern recordings but a quantum leap above the other issues of the Johnson Recordings available, which have been so heavily manipulated to ""sound better"" that Johnson's remarkable voice sounds like it's been strained through socks in comparison.If you have any interst in the blues, these versions of these landmark recordings will you closer to Johnson's voice and guitar work."
1,I want my money back!,"Clearly one of the best of the English bands of the 60's, this recording, gorged with filler material that should have never been released including an awful commercial for 'Great Shakes.' With truly terrible ballads by 'Together,' this recording is an exploitation of the reputation of a great band."
3,Guess what you don't need ...,"All those extras that are packaged with this mediocre recording. I did like the acoustic version of White Summer, but by this point in time, The Yardbirds are dead."
3,Nutshell review of the Little Games Session & more double CD,"Many of the earlier reviews of these CDs give some fine details on the songs so I will not repeat them but to give you a nutshell review: If you are a casual fan of the Yardbirds, get the earlier albums before thinking about this one. This is their last and weakest effort although there are some good things here. If you are a Yardbirds fan, or a Led Zep fan interested in the bands origins, then you ought to get this double CD version rather than the single release. Some of these songs delight and others irritate but I am very grateful that this version was released."
3,Too much information,"Let me start by saying I'm not new to the civil war...so maybe this book would be better for newbies. It is definitely ""exhaustively"" researched. The author is obviously very good at genealogy. Unfortunately, that's what this book is...genealogy. There is sooo much information about Sullivan Ballou's relatives and neighbors that it just drags on. I don't need to know about these distant relatives and where they worked. That said, if you don't already know much about the civil war or living in that era, it is worth the buy. Even if you are like me and own hundreds of civil war books, this one could be worth the purchase for the Manassas section...once you finally reach those chapters."
2,Please Find An Ending,"After a thrilling one-hundred fifty pages, this novel just plain wilted. And the ending, if not predictable (I won't give away who done it, but it's not that hard to figure out), was then a series of boring epilogues. It seems like this novel was not quite ready when released, and needs to be revised, rewritten. After a promising start, a disappointing ending. And that simply sucks."
2,Wasn't Good - Predictable,"I too bought this book based off the glowing recommendations, but after reading it, I felt it just wasn't any good: the story was disjointed and predictable and many, many points are repeated ad naseum. Also, the overuse of adverbs vexed. Every character, after they said a line of dialogue, was followed up with ""He said coldly; softly, suddenly, quickly, angrily. Even the sun ""throbbed fiercely"". Read at your own risk."
2,Overwhelming details!,I find the Kitchens in this book to be so overdone that its painful! I'm an Interior Designer and was looking for ideas and inspiration. Neither were supplied by the content of this book. The details actually become overwhelming rather than working as an integral part of beautifully pioneered spaces!I would recommend Kitchens by Chris Casson Madden. Might be a little dated now but still helpful.
5,Let Kids Be Kids,"I saw this reviewed in the Orlando Sentinel. I'm impressed that the author promotes informal play. Children often are overscheduled today or plugged into the TV/gameboy/computer. The book reminds us that children need some time to just be themselves and to putter and play.As adults, many of us feel overscheduled with a never-ending ""to do"" list. Let's not turn our children into this type A behavior any sooner than necessary.Other books on this topic: Putting Family First by William Doherty and Einstein Never Used Flash Cards by Kathy Hirsh-Pasek."
2,Lacks substance,"This book lacks direction and any substance to be worth reading. I began to tire of the trite comments, even though I was deeply interested in the subject matter. The author didn't use much research or detailed explanations on how to provide more for a child.It also gets old reading the many children's comments when they say they want ""world peace."" Though it touches on the child's desire for security, it didn't need to be recycled throughout the text for every argument. As parents we can't make the world perfect for our children - war is a way to combat evilness in the world.Since many statements on this book teetered on political propaganda (on the liberal side), I tired of this book quickly.I will second the opinion of the previous reviewer who stated that 'Einstein Never Used Flash Cards' by Kathy Hirsh-Pasek is an EXCELLENT book."
4,SOLID FOR THE PRICE,"As others have described, decent unit, especially considering the value. Instructions were fairly clear, although some interpretation needed, and peg hole #s for DVD usage were incorrect. There is some mild 'echoing' in the exterior finish from the camber screws pressing on the inside, but hopefully this will not worsen over time.I also found that one part was missing (in a bag with almost 250 parts); this was a critical euro-head screw to fasten vertical panels to each other, not readily available on the local hardware market. Company did not respond at all to urgent email, so I was forced to engineer something from my garage screw supply. I am stunned that a few extras of each part weren't included...each hardware item has to cost mere pennies.Others remarked that unit was difficult to move after assembly...perhaps on carpet, but I installed self-stick felt pads to the base, and it slides readily on hardwood."
5,Perfect!,"This was a gift and they love it! The box arrived somewhat damaged so I was a little worried. However, it was packaged so well that the item wasn't touched. The directions made it easy to put together and it holds all their movies and music in a small area. This is a must-have! One note: it is very heavy and needs someone strong to lift the box when it is delivered."
4,Great shelves,"Gret product. Easy to assemble. Good instructions. Sturdy. I finally have a way to store all my DVDs in a closet where there is not much space. Luckily, the rotating shelf design is a rel space saver."
4,reviewing 612 Rack,"The CD rack came without a tracking number,(causing me to lose 3 days pay waiting for it) and took 4 weeks for UPS to deliver. Once put together, the Rack work out very well. I would buy it again. If they could have deliver on time, I would given it a five star."
3,Venture Horizon 2385-21Bl revolving media tower multimedia,"I chose this rating as the part that was missing , the name of his piec is trntpl or (Swivel Plate) I finally received myPiece today.i hope this will take care of my problem"
2,didn't realise it was particle board,I have to say I move allot so I hate particle board. I purchased this for dvd's which it didn't hold close to all of my dvd's. I also forgot to put the little wood stumps in so I broke it during assembly. If don't ever plan on moving this would probably be a good item for you especially if your good and reading directions but for me it's crap.
1,GARBAGE,"I hate this item , i HATE the mechanism and this not work . please don`t spend your money on this garbage."
1,Better than TR-100?,"I bought the TR-100 and after less than 500 staples, the spring which drives the staples broke - and no repair parts are available. Waste of money."
5,hola todo fino,hola todo finohola todo fino gustaooo muchoooooo everything right all excellent recommendy poreque esta muy buernono em ha llegadotodo bien lo recomiendo
4,You get what you pay for,"I bought this staple gun for an upholstery class. I was willing to pay more to get the flexibility of the nail/staple option and wanted something where I wouldn't wear my hand out as with an old fashioned staple gun.As other reviewers have noted, it's not very powerful. That said, I was much happier with this Stanley than the other women were with their squeeze staple guns. For $10/day there was a higher powered rental available, which was the best of the lot (after I looked to buy and it retails for $150).What it comes down to is what you want to use this staple gun for. Don't expect this to replace a pneumatic tool. If you need that kind of power, either because of heavy use, or to use with hard woods, then this staple gun won't meet your needs. But if you want a step up from the old fashion staple gun that is lightweight, quiet & flexible (it takes 10 kinds of staples and 2 kinds of nails), this is a good choice."
1,"It should be called ""The Jammer"" - poorly designed","I have to echo Mr. Titus' review. I bought this unit to do some light upholstery work. It seems to feed the brads okay, but lacks the power to drive them either flush or below the surface even on pine!Then I tried using staples (since that is the primary purpose for upholstery.) What a huge disappointment. Every staple jammed or would not feed to the nose. This is the result of a very poor design and/or poorly executed manufacturing (not meeting dimensional specifications, etc.) Stanley ought to pull this out of production and fix the problems. This piece of junk will harm their reputation.I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this staple/nail gun. You will be sorry if you do."
1,Complete waste of money,"I bought this about a year ago to install mosquito screen in pine and spruce lumber. On the low power setting it will drive 5/16"" staples about 2/3 of the way in. On high power it shoots 2, 3 or 4 staples at a time with only one press of the trigger. The Stanley guarantee says it all:LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTYStanley warrants this product to the original purchaser for its useful life (not to exceed one year for products with electrical or electronic components) against deficiencies in material and workmanship.Its useful life - not to exceed one year. Well, its useful life certainly did not exceed one year. It barely exceeded one week."
1,No power,I bought one of these about 5 years ago. It works ok in soft woods with short staples if you hold it down rather tightly against the wood. But after a few years I find it to be somewhat worthless since it cannot drive any kind of staple in anything but soft wood. So now I am back to Amazon looking for another electric stapler with some power. I don't always need the power. But there have been too many times when more power would have made all the difference.
2,"okay, but definitely not great","works when using 1/4"" staples, but nothing larger. i bought it hoping to use 1/2"" staples, but when using these you must hammer each one in after stapling. also, the trigger is quite hard to pull; i have to use both hands to pull it properly."
5,Well chosen set of popular songs,"This compilation is definitely packed with a fantastic set of tracks, most of them as performed by the original artists, or at least by the artists that made the song popular. The tracks are also well arranged on the CDs so that there is a good mix of the soppy tracks and the upbeat tracks. The overall sound quality is surprisingly good. The main reason why I bought this compilation is that it contains tracks which are either impossible to buy separately, or at least require searching for and buying a CD that only has a ""one hit wonder"" track. It would certainly be a costly affair to make up your own compilation with the same tracks. This is definitely one of the better ""The Best XXXX Album In The World...Ever!"" compilations - a good buy."
3,For Serious Students of History Only,"This is a very thorough, meticulously referenced book with a tremendous number and variety of facts about Gladiators, BUT it is not well organized for easy reading.It is NOT recommended for someone with casual interest in Gladiators and other Spectacle Entertainments among Romans."
2,"A curiosity, not much more ...","I have the complete set (on single CDs), purchased many years ago because (similar to what the Amazon review stated) I initally enjoyed hearing a ""different"" view of Beethoven. But I now find I usually quickly go back to the Karajan 70's set after listening to any of these for a while. The Adagio in the 9th is particularly jarring - at the speeds taken by Norrington this beautiful movement becomes almost comical.Not impressed."
2,Having a professor who writes his own text not always good.,"I had Professor Gonzalez for my applied math class and we used this book. while is a unique take, including history and background, the subject matter remained unclear at times. It is hard to grasp as a sophmore in college and it goes to fast in a classroom setting. While I agree that other professor's should use this book as a reference tool, I have experienced it first-hand in the classroom and it caused more confusion than anything else."
3,They Always Find a Way to Ruin Things.,"The remastering is great. And I bought the CD for just $3 sealed. BUT the azzwholes did it again. Just as they did with Walter Benton's OUT OF THIS WORLD CD, a tune was left off this CD in order to make time to include a second LP. I HATE THAT!!! Give us the whole damned sessions, even if it takes two CDs. Are there no alternate takes you could have included? Sheesh, we wait years and years for these sessions to appear on CD, and unless we buy Japanese, it seems there's always something to ruin these domestic issues. LAME!!!Sal was a month shy of age 53 when he passed."
5,first edition id by publishers,"A Pocket Guide to the Identification of First Editions is all the ""book scouts"" say it is - invaluable to the novice and veteran collector. It's listing of small and obscure publisher's methods of identifying first editions is something that you cannot find anywhere else."
2,And this is an expert?,"I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying ""But McBride's Books Say"". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind."
5,Easy basics on identifying firsts,"The introduction gives a solid background on first editions in general. The bulk of the booklet -- and it is a booklet to carry with you -- is a 100-page list of about 3600 publishers, large and small, famous and obscure. For each publisher, the typical first edition clues are given. Indispensable and affordable.For the details of well-known true firsts, itemized title by title, see the author's other book, Points of Issue."
2,I paid 14 bucks for this?,"This is not to fault the vendor from whom I purchased this item used, the price as new was even more. And not to question the information enclosed therein: it's probably fairly accurate and all that. But to use the word ""book"" as a physical description is misleading. Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free. (Hmmm, there's an idea)So do what I should have done if I'd been using my noodle. Go to the reference section of your local library and use the copy machine. And take the money you saved and buy a real book."
4,Indispensable Guide,"This little book does only one trick, but it does it well. If you have a need to quickly identify first edition books, you need this book."
4,LADY FORTESCUE'S ACVENTURE,"Lady Fortescue is a lonely old lady who was formerly a member of the aristocrats in London. She is now a poor widow who has held on to her large house and her two servants. She is often hungry because she is so poor. She has a rich relative who invites her occasionally and on her last visit, she steals some candlesticks from a seldom used room. She get's caught and is sent home in disgrace. She is totally embarrassed and one day walks to the park and is thinking about her disgrace when she comes upon an elderly man who is in the same situation. She invites him for dinner and after that, they scheme to go in search of others in the same situation. Once they gather a few, they turn the house into a hotel. Many adventures take place in the hotel and then there is a very happy ending. This is a feel good story. I enjoyed it."
1,Marion Chesney 6,"The book came in all od it's glory and then I set it down in my house. Now, I can't find it :("
2,My bad,"Because I love the Agatha series and Hamish books by M.C. Beaton, I thought I'd love this book. Her awesome writing really shines through, but not being a fan of romances this book did nothing for me at all."
3,Lady fortescue steps out,A nice light hearted read. An interesting group of characters and time period. Not sure how far the series can go.
4,Passed the CLEP,"I bought this book to pass a CLEP test. I did not study as much as I wanted to but did pass the test. I now see that there is an official CLEP study guide and would assume that would be better for studying for the CLEP. This is a very large book to read through and the new CLEP study guide is only ~288 pages.However, the quality of this book is very good."
1,Missing pages,"My husband ordered this book for his Masters Degree. He recieved it in a timely manner, however, it was missing the first 25 pages. We had to send it back. He had to buy this book at Barnes and Noble in order to have it in time for his class to start."
3,Record company wants your money,"Maybe I've been spoiled by the likes of U2, who are always trying to give something new to their audience -even if they're releasing just a Greatest Hits album.Don't get me wrong, I've known and loved Shakira since 1995 and I have supported her English crossover. But this is A PRODUCT, I really don't think she was even involved... there are NO new tracks, and not all of her SINGLES have been included. At least in Mexico, ""Moscas en la casa"" was never released. Instead I'd include ""Pies descalzos, sueños blancos"".The songs are great, but the album doesn't offer us anything new except for the VCD, which doesn't include any full lenght videos. This CD screams ""buy, buy, buy!"" even if nothing special has been offered."
4,star,"This is my first Shakira album and I think I picked a good start because her first two albums I heard were bad and I can't ever find pies dal.. (bare feet) and donde esta ladrones, I didn't want to get that and Laundry, well I don't like her singing english. I can't understand her and I feel like she didn't know English that well yet, anyway this album is good, very good. I like her fast songs but I really love her ballads because you can FEEL the sadness."
3,"Shakira Greatest Hits. Well, this CD it's not that great","Yes, it has all Shakira's Hits but i feel that this album needed a little bit more music. She left out greatest songs like 'Se Quiere, Se Mata' 'Pies Descalzos' and 'Octavo Dia', the original versions of 'No Creo' and 'Tu'. And i think that a new song wouldn't be a bad idea. I don't like the MTV Unpluged versions and well i already owned this songs because these songs are from only two albums. and of course, the unplugged one.But this album works perfectly for casual fans, or the fans that Shakira gained with 'Laundry Service'(those ones that didn't know anything about Shakira before she released that album and of course the ones that don't speak spanish). Go for it if you're one of those!"
5,EXCELENTE!!!!!!!!,"This CD is my favorite Cd by Shakira! It was the first one I bought in spanish and I would recommend it to anyone who wants real Shakira flavor. The best song on it is Ojos Asi. The english version is not that great because it doesn't show how Shakira's voice can hit high notes.I wish more songs were on it however. If Pies Descalzos, Suenos Blancos Te Espero Sentada and Se quiere Se mata were on this Cd it would be absolutely perfetca!! But besides that I definetly encourage fans to buy it if they already haven't."
2,Average,"This compilation is not bad, and is not good. It's average. Here is too many songs from Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones?. They could put here more songs from Laundry Service. I don't recommend to buy it. It's only for die-hard fans."
2,Rip-OFF,"This costume has really frilly edges, so if your kids are like most kids and want to wear their costume before and after halloween you can forget about it. The frilly edges just come apart from simple wear and running or walking around it. The only thing decently made of this costume was the belt and the head band. It does not come with an eye patch or sword. Your better off taking a white shirt and cutting a design in it. At least you could wear it more than an hour without it starting to fall apart. The cheapest costume I've ever seen and I buy 5 costumes a year."
5,I love Dealing With Dragons!,"I had heard of this book. I wasn't sure at first which book was first, and I have a determined stubborn habit, of not reading books in the middle. So I waited til I figured which book was first in this series. I was hooked from the first page.I love this heroine! I love stories with food in it, so you can use all your senses. I love stories with magic in it, and I like stories in which the protaganist is a strong female.I have read and purchased my own copies of all the books to Talking to Dragons. I can't wait to read more, including the Book of Enchantments."
5,THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING!,This is my favorite book out of the Dragon Trillogy by Patricia C. Wrede...I think she is a brilliant author and should be honored for her achievments in reading.The characters are wonderfly writen and the ending is stupendouse! Kazul and the princess are the most lovable and mystical characters as well as the wizards dragons and even the stone prince. I recomend you to read this book right away..and not to hesitate!
5,Awesome Babi!,This book was soooo awesome! I loved it! This is the fantsy and science fiction book that everyone will LOVE to read. There was even a little bit of comedy! If your looking for a funny fantasy book- this is the one to get!
3,Slightly interesting but too juvenile,"I'm a modest fan of the underappreciated Patricia Wrede, who can almost always be counted on for plucky young heroines and fast, rollicking tales. This book left me cold, however. It seemed aimed at a much younger audience than her normal books, and the humor was a little too silly for my tastes. Still, judging from all the other wonderful reviews on this book, perhaps I should go back and try it again."
5,Great book,i enjoy reading a nice book that is easy on the mind before going to sleep. this book has a simple/enjoyable plot. i love fantasy stories about knights and wizards and i was pleased to find a short yet entertaining book. This book was a real catch and i am looking forward to the next book
5,A Very Enjoyable Book,"This book is great! It is about a princess who hates doing the usual princess things: embroidery, etiquette, and drawing. So she starts taking other lessons as well: fencing, Latin, cooking, economics, and juggling.Her parents, of course, find out about all these lessons and they stop them saying that they aren't proper for a princess.Her parents decide to marry her to a very stupid and annoying prince. When she hears about her parent's plans, she decides to run away.While running away she meets a dragon, and she volunteers to cook and clean for the dragon.While with the dragon, she has an adventure that includes dragons, wizards, and a witch."
5,One of the best series ever written!!,"This book (and all of the others) are a masterpiece. I absolutely love them. Patricia C. Wrede makes everything come to life. I love the way Cimorene is so down to earth, and the way Morwen is so practical. These books are so unique and different, full of magic, royalty, dragons, knights, witches, etc. Wrede makes the world seem so neat and fasinating that you want to live in the books. I have read this series so many times that i have to glue the cover back on them. I would recommend these to everyone."
5,Cimarene is not a proper princess!,"Cimarene is not a proper princess. She has brown hair instead of blond. She is very tall. She doesn't like etiquette or embroidery. She's her own person. A great example for a young woman! She certainly doesn't want to marry some dumb prince. When a frog suggests she get help at a shanty near the forest, she finds herself in the company of dragons. Normally this would frighten a princess, but Cimarene charms one of the dragons into letting her be a dragon's princess - that way she would properly not have to get married! She gets along swimmingly with her dragon Kazul. With the help of a stone prince, a sweet but flighty dragon princess friend and a very clean witch, Cimarene ultimately saves the dragon kingdom from the evil wizards' plot to overcome the kingdom using magic from the Caves of Fire and Night. Patricia Wredes's writing is whimsical, upbeat and downright fun and Cimarene's spirit is undefeatable. I didn't want to stop reading!"
4,A Review from Corey from Creston,"The novel Dealing with Dragons was a great fairy tail. I loved this novel. Because it was so, so, so, so descriptive.Yes the author was actually able to hold me through this novel with her snappy comments, descriptiveness and her ways or techniques of telling you what or who was doing something.If I could make any changes I would and wouldn't. The first thing I wouldn't change is the description. I wouldn't change how she wrote it in the point of view she used. The things I would change would be the names of the characters.I would recommend this book to some of my friends because it's a wonderful."
5,A New Type of Princess,This is a wonderfully written story that makes the traditional fairly tale princesses fall short. Cimorene is great new twist into the traditional world with her non-princess appearence and personality. She's got a tomboy attitude and she means business! Its a great story that will keep you wondering what this girl will do next. Once you've read the first book in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles you'll just have to keep reading them to see how else the story unfold. A great read for all ages!
4,Princess of Linderwall or a Dragon's Princess,Princess Cimorene hates being a princess.She hates all the lessons princesses have to take and is engaged to a prince she abseloutly hates.So ane day Cimorene decides to run away.She is given directions by a frog where to go.She finds the place that she's supposed to go to and finds some dragons.Cimorene vounteers to be a dragon's princess.She meets other princesses and meets some evil wizards.Cimorene goes on a big adventure to stop the wizards and ruin their plans.
4,A great book for young readers,"I read this book about a year ago and it was great! The story is about a bored princess named Cimorene who is absolutely sick of learning how to be a lady, so she decides to run away from home and have adventures. (The best move she ever made if you ask me) After following the directions of a talking frog, she befriends and becomes the princess of the mighty dragon Kazul. All in all this was a funny, lighthearted tale that makes fun of just about every fantasy story and fairy tale that has come out in the past five hundred years or so. Though some of the jokes may be lost on readers not previosly well read in fantasy, it is still an excellant and well written book with lots of strong female characters."
5,I would reccomend this book to any age fantasy-lover.,"This book is a fantastic fairy tale. It icludes all areas of the traditional fairy tale. Flaxen-haired princesses, handsome princes, dragons, wizards, knights, a king and queen. Yet Cimorene (the main character) is not an ordinary princess. When Cimorene can stand her boring princess life no longer she takes the advice of a talking frog and runs away. Cimorene becomes princess to the dragon Kazul and life is alot more interesting.As soon as you meet Cimorene you'll want to visit her everyday. So if you have never read this book you really should and I assure you you'll be holding you breath to get the rest of the series."
4,Good for Younger Readers,"I found this book entertaining. I like books that have to do with enchantment, magic spells, and dragons. Cimorene and her friends are unforgettable and funny.Cimorene is a headstrong girl who can't seem to get being a princess down. So she volenteers to be captured by a dragon, Kazul. Within her time there she deals with annoying knights, troublesome wizards, and a stone prince. My only complaint is that it was more for younger kids then older. It wasn't really hard to read and the climax was short lived. There really wasn't anything to keep those older then 12 interested. Yet I reccomend this book for a bedtime story."
4,"Pretty good, but not intended for experienced readers","This book is about a plucky princess, who I found entertaining. Patricia Wrede's writing style is lively.However, the plot isn't very good. This is a classic ""plot coupon"" story. The princess collects a bunch of stuff, and miraculously it is all used in the end. This happens in Harry Potter too, but in that book the character's morals are tested as well. Here the character's morals are never tested at all. I found the ending predictable and forgetable.All that said, this book is probably a good read for someone who hasn't read hundreds of books already. More experienced readers will probably be entertained by the style but bored by the plot."
4,Great Fun to Be Had,"Princess Cimorene shucks her expected destiny to become Kazul the Dragon's princess in this clever and amusing tale, the best in this series by a nose (quite a large nose, in fact).It's fast-paced, good-hearted, quick-witted, and a very fun read. The second in the series is also recommended, but I found the later books diminishing returns--enjoyable for their own sake, but not as much a delight as this first.Note: 3 stars, for me, is a pretty good review, 4 is for extremely distinguished works, and 5 only for those I consider classics. Most of what is published is, unfortunately, a 2 or less."
4,A good humorous fantasy,"Cimorene is a good female role model and this story is an interesting twist on the story we all know, about a princess being captured by an evil dragon and being rescued by a prince. Instead, Cimorene runs away to live with the dragon and has trouble chasing away all the annoying rescuers! I read it a pretty long time ago, but I remember it was better than I expected. I like fantasy a lot, but I really hate when it gets into mythical creatures--centaurs, unicorns, dragons &c. My fantasy choices are more along the lines of The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman. Even so, this book was really funny and even exciting in parts and anyone who wants a nice light-hearted fantasy with strong female characters should give it a try. You'll probably laugh out loud in some parts. I don't know if you'll want to read all of the books though. I haven't but I might give it a try. --Grace, age 14"
3,Books,Great book was not the one I was looking for but that was my fault. It is still the first book in the series just a different version.
3,Plot too obvious,"Hum... so I am not part of the appropriate age group that should read this. I found the book's plot too obvious, and from the start of the book one already knows which one will be the bad dragon. There is no suspense. However, it is a good book for girls, as it has two strong female characters: the dragon, and her princess servant."
3,Grow Up,"Look, I adore fantasy, but this book is kinda immature, don't you think? I mean, the characters are underdeveloped and the plot repetitive. Although it's readable, it's not all that great. By the way, don't read the next one. It's pretty much the same story. P.S.Why don't they want the wizards to have power? It never says why, so I am forced to come to the conclusion that the main characters are just power freaks."
1,So this is young adult reading?,"I did not enjoy this book.Why?Because I purchased this book thinking it was YOUNG ADULT fiction.(a) It was not young adult fiction. Look again. Young adult fiction = TEEN fition.(b) This story seemed to be written for CHILDREN ages 6-9.(c) It FAILED to be exciting in any way. I was bored half the time and the other half I was drifting away in my mind to escape the boringness of the book. i.e. ""I wonder what book I should read after I'm finally done with this one?""or ""Hmmm I wonder how many more chapters I have to go?"" or ""Oh wow we have a new president!""Anyway...A story with a feminist as the protagonist: check.A story that failed to be entertaining: check.A story that made wizards out to be bad when Harry Potter fans are reading it: check.A book that is now listed on ebay to try to get my money back from buying the whole set?CHECK."
4,Relaxed ditties with Kevin,"Kevin Ayers is wonderful. Hedonistic, charming,and soft-spoken. He sings like he's letting you in on a secret (or playing a joke on you!) His songs are inspiring / witty / weird / melodious.If you haven't heard him yet, this wouldn't be the worst place to start.It's a great CD. It captures 4 different sessions with Kevin Ayers, with three different bands backing him: The Soft Machine, The Whole World, and his Banana Follies cohort Archie Leggit.In this way, it gives a good overview of early 70s Kevin. The second half of the CD (with Archie Leggit) is particularly enlightening. They make one of the most rocking duos you'll ever hear (bass and guitar)! There's a great reading of Falling in Love again that you have to hear!"
3,All this for a song . . .,". . . kind of depends on what song is playing at the time. If it's some of the stuff he does with the Whole World, then you'll be hard put to find better. Stand outs include Gemini Chile and Lady Rachel, as well as a completely whacked version of We Did It Again. The Banana follies stuff is a complete yawn. That's a matter of preference, however; if you weren't one of those kinds of people like myself who have been profoundly sick of the unplugged versions of your favorite songs, then plod away with the last five tracks and discover much to your nonamazement that he didn't improve upon any of these tracks. The only asset is Butterfly Dance, and that's only because it is so hard to find on any other of his albums. Even here, the song is still way cool. As for the Soft Machine stuff, like the liner notes imply, a little too many spirits were probably imbibed at the time of recording. It could have been so much better. That goes double for the whole CD."
2,hard to build,quite hard to build (we needed it for a project my son did at school); really small parts; some of the holes are not where they are supposed to be; a zillion pieces; in the end we managed - with some ingenuity and with leaving many parts aside - and it looked like a pretty nice ship once we were done
2,This CD is an outright lie!,"The record company that put this CD out is telling an outright lie to the customers. The CD ""supposedly"" contains the original recordings of Judy's greatest hits. However, the songs on this CD are definitely NOT the original recordings!!! These are not the original hits which are played on the radio, and which appear on Judy's original albums. I've been listening to the music of Judy Torres for many years, and I know that these are not the same recordings that were on Judy's original singles and albums. The versions on this album are re-recorded versions done by Judy Torres. The songs don't sound bad (except for the extra-heavy echo), but they ARE NOT the original hit recordings."
2,This is NOT the Original Recording!!!,"I just purchased this CD and should have listened to the guy who already gave it ""2"" stars. I grew up listening to Freestyle and I cannot believe how they put out a CD with such a different sound. Dont get me wrong, I love Judy Torres but the recordings are much different than the original version of ""Love Story"". If you want to hear what the real recordings sound like, go on to her website judytorres.com. I will continue to search for the original copy of ""Love Story"" on CD!"
4,Positive reinforcement for Mom's return to work,"This book uses positive anecdotes to ensure women that being a working mom is fine. I bought this book when I went back to work after having my first child. It seems that new moms are wrapped up in guilt on going back to work; however in today's society, the reality is that in most partnerships, both mom and dad end up working just to make ends meet.This book will give you a little extra boost to let you know that working will not be detrimental to your child. Love your child and be ensured that your child will benefit, whether you work or not."
4,Unique and Well Played,"""Tails of the City,"" featuring the San Francisco Saxophone Quartet, is a very nice CD for one to add to their ""eclectic classical collection."" All the pieces are arrangements of well-known classical works, the standouts on this recording being the Air from Orchestral Ste. 3 (Bach), Adagio (Albinoni), and the Quartet, Op. 16, #6 (Bach). The most endearing characteristic about this CD is that the performaces are superb. All the works are well-suited to their arrangements for saxophone quartet, the ensemble plays with a very sweet sound, with precise articulation, and with a very high level of musicianship."
4,Read at least 4 examples,"What you see is abnormal writing. The well-being of special, common and normal writing is not here. Wittgenstein did something else. What did he do?"
1,Not one of the great books.,"Wittgenstein was cryptic in the extreme. This has been mistaken for wisdom. Though he was considered an oracle by the 20th century he is likely, as was Herbert Spencer, famous in his own day, to be ignored by the subsequent generation.This is not a book to spend much time on if you have real philosophical problems to solve. If you are looking for curios in the history of philosophy, by all means spend an hour."
3,Snow - Short 1929 Love Story,"I became interested in this book reading the jacket cover that explained that this was a story about a widow, her sick child, and the son of the town's coal vendor. The story take place in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and since by Father lives there I decided to give it a try.It is a very short book, a real fast read, with a fairly simple plot, but I enjoyed the story and the characters in the book.I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys an uncomplicated story that has a happy, feel good ending."
1,"pls, don't buy this","this is the worst ""dnb/jungle"" cd i ever bought. His world domination cd was better than this so dont waste your money. The sound quality also sounds terrible and MC Flipside is the worst."
1,Recoil starter,The handle insert was missing and I had to improvise that part. On the third pull and the thing flew to pieces...totally self destructed. $35.00 wasted on this product not to mention the frustration of a piece of equipment that was inoperable because of a starting cord. I troweled my concrete by hand while the gas fired power trowel sat idle. This is a low grade worthless product...not worth the manpower and fuel to manufacture and deliver to the buyer.
1,"Horrible, worse than my garage band on our worst night!!","Just imagine, if someone had never heard Pat's genius work and stumbled onto this cd. They would never give him another chance! Pat is one of the most gifted musicians of all time. He has made some of the most beautiful music ever. He is truly talented and a person you must see live. I have only one question: what were you thinking Pat?"
1,DON'T BY THIS,I've been a fan of Pat Metheny and his music for 30 years. I can't imagine what was going on in his mind when he recorded this.I had a long horrible review that I wrote but I just can't post it. This is freeking Pat Metheny and I have to say this is a rather small bleep in his musical career.The last thing I'll say is if you're a Pat Metheny fan. I would not recommend this cd.YMMV
2,"Unsurprisingly, not my favorite Pat Metheny disc...","Ok, it's not my favorite. But...can I make a suggestion to those of you slamming it as nothing but noise? If you haven't already sold your copy, try listening to Pt. 2. There's music in there."
4,Awesome,"Simply Pat Metheny in a room with a guitar, overdubbed to the max. It is beautiful. Pat Metheny is definitely virtuoso and although he'd never say so, I love this pseudo-tribute to free jazz. Pat Metheny fans definitely be wary, it is not the same as everything else he has done. Put some effort into listening this and you will be rewarded. This is the sort of thing that when you appreciate it, you will have opened a door to the philosophy of listening to music and sound. Take the step if you dare..."
1,Zero Tolerance for this Album,"This was a utter disappointment. The only reason to buy this album is to complete a collection, not for listening. I respect 'artistic creativity' but this is too much. I'm almost certain I could have created many of the same sounds found on this album, and I have never played guitar in my life."
3,black metal,"All that first track needs is blastbeats. I have this on a burnt cd and I honestly thought it was something I did for the first 3 minutes. Then the scale runs got a bit faster and I realized nope its probably pat metheny. Imagine my shock and awe! This really is a departure for Pat and this album is hard to digest. Hard to digest in the way the Flying Luttenbachers or Orthrelm are hard to digest. I personally like some of the sounds he was getting on this album, especially when he focused on blunt repetitive rhythms. That said, the guitar tone is incredibly grating and most of this would have been better chopped up into smaller doses and sprinkled among some more tuneful material. Worth a listen but make sure you have some tylenol nearby."
1,True Story re: this album,"The townhouse next door to mine was for sale. The realtor brought a very unsavory-looking couple to look at it and I thought, ""Oh, I hope THEY don't move in!"" Suddenly, I had a brainstorm! I opened all the windows to my house, inserted Zero Tolerance in the CD player- and cranked it up!!!Needless to say, the prospective buyers left very shortly thereafter and were never seen again.I love Pat Metheny and I would buy any of his albums without a listen prior to the release of this monstrosity."
4,"Terry Kath's Original ""Guitar Noise""","It's interesting that back in 1968 with Chicago Transit Authority's first album (later known as just ""Chicago"") electric guitarist Terry Kath recorded a very early effort at ""artistic noise"" with Free Form Guitar."
2,Frustrated Metheny?,Metheny's music is usually filled with warmth and joy. Here he sound frustrated!
1,If anything below Zero were possible...,"I love Pat Metheny, have seen him 7 times since 1979, and respect his musicianship,songwriting ability, collaborations, and production skills..but it seems like he picked up a new technique at this point, and felt the need to make some noise on the spot and record it..he must have been angry that day..the senseless noise which is emitted from your speakers when this disk is played will make even the most hard core fan angry, wince, or use the disk as a coaster, which is a more practical application than the torture which you will inflict upon your ears. Avoid it at all costs."
1,What a Waste,"I received this CD thinking I was going to finally be able to get some songs from the 70s that I hadn't been able to get on CD. Unfortunately, these may be the original artists, but all the songs are remakes and not the actual 70s' hits. The quality of the arrangements, not to mention the artists' voices, is worse than karaoke night at a senior citizens' singles dance. These artists should have quit when they were ahead. This CD is headed for the trash. I would be too ashamed to even give it away."
4,An educational fun film.,"Haven been intrigued since childhood on the Monarch, I bought this film to see some footage of there voyage. What I got was a voyage of my own as I went along on their travels to Mexico and back. Truely amazing legacies exist in these insects that is captured and portraid by the creators of this video. Great photography!"
5,uplifting,On the Wings of the Monarch is a beautiful film about a beautiful animal. I was very impressed by the detail in which they lead you through this amazing animals journey through life. Generally a very informative piece that takes you to some special places while following along this wonderful journey. The audience gets a full dose of what nature is about and why it should always be preserved. The Monarch butterflies are a noble species to back up a Royal effoft!
3,On the Wings of the Monarch,"This video has some beautiful pictures and good information. It is a little more scientific than I wanted ; I intend to show this for children in grade school. Overall, I was happy with the quality of the video."
2,Weak,"Item was defective, wouldn't turn off, button broken. Vibration was very mild, not what you would expect for the cost.Find something better for the money."
5,review,Tantus makes great silicon products. Joyhollywood is a pleasure to purchase from. Super fast shipping.
3,A good history,"I'm on number 3 in a series of 6 about women in South Dakota, my native state. I am finding this book slower reading than numbers 1 and 2, but worth finishing."
2,rete 1,"This was an Italian text book. It was rate as in good condition. And while the overall condition was good, many of the exercises on the inside had been completed by the previous owner. I think it was poorly presented."
4,Do you feel me? I feel you!,"How is this CD different from the first Crank Yankers CD? This one features the theme song by Fountains of Wayne! Other than that, it is much the same as the first Crank Yankers CD. Funny crank phone calls! Hilarious characters like Hadassah Guberman, Niles Standish, Elmer Higgins, Spoonie Luv and Special Ed! If you are a fan of crank phone calls, you will dig this CD."
1,Crank Yankers CD not DVD,I typed in Crank Yankers DVD and CD's came up instead so I ordered something I didn't want and there is NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT to make changes.SHAME ON AMAZON
1,Not worth your money,"We thought that since this product was made out of canvas fire hose material, it would be tough and durable. Not so--our 2 dachshunds managed to rip off an edge on each of their separate toys within minutes of play, rendering their toys useless. The squeaker on one never really worked, and the other stopped working almost immediately. So we might as well have thrown the money for these 2 toys in the trash, since the toys went there in less than a day's time."
2,Looks can be deceiving.,"To a human, this appears to be indestructible, but not to my Wheaten puppy. He was able to bite through both black ends and hose underneath with ease. Oh well."
3,Not for a hard core chewer!,My one year old Beagle is a tough dog to find a toy for. She is literally focused on destroying whatever toy she gets by chewing it to shreds.I had high hopes for the Hard Core Fire Hose dog toy. Within the hour she had the squeeker ripped out. By the second day the toy was shredded 50% and bits of rubber and fabric all over the house. I removed the stuffing from it as soon as she had ripped out the squeeker so we were spared that mess at least.I really wish this toy was indeed hard core but I am afraid I cannot recommend it if you have a hard core chewer.
2,waste of money,"My 8 lb. Chi chewed the ends off of this in 10 minutes. the ""fire hose"" part might hold up but the binding on the ends is crap. I keep trimming off the threads, but I should just throw it away."
2,small dogs,"I Have a dachshund, hes only 9monts old and this lasted him about 3 hours before he had it ripped open at the seems. He is a very heavy chewer. It did last him longer than most but like all others this two failed. This is not a good toy for any type of heavy chewer."
2,It lasted a few weeks,"He'd lose interest in it and it would lay around. Then he'd pick it up and chew on it, knowing it was his and his alone (the other 3 aren't interested in these things). Fortunately, one of the squeakers didn't work and the other was not easy for him to squeak, so his attention would wander. Then a visitor came for a few hours, and happened to find it so he had to show it off. Then he had to chew it for real, and it lasted maybe an hour, with fluff and canvas all over. So don't think this is a HARD CORE toy!"
1,Didn't hold up AT ALL,"I purchased this product for my one year old Border Collie. He is a hard chewer so he needs a high quality toy. I had high hopes for this product as I had used similar products for clients as a Veterinary Technician. However, this product did not even last 24hrs. My dog had chewed both ends off and pulled the inside out. I had shredded bits of fire hose all over the house. If you have a hard chewing dog this WILL NOT hold up for long."
1,Didn't stand up,"I ordered this for my 1 year old puppy... he is a pretty hard chewer. So when the packaging said for tough and hard chewers I was all about it. Unfortunately, the product lasted maybe three hours before it was completely ripped apart."
1,Don't waste your money!,Less than 20 minutes for my dog to rip into it. I've bought several other toys for her that have lasted much longer.
5,Dog loves it.,The is the only thing my dog has played with that her sharp teeth has not destroyed in a matter of minuets.
3,mutts trash BOB,it only took 3 days to trash BOB but it has lasted longer than everything else. it is still usable. totally flat and ragged it's still throwable and fetchable. we have back up BOBs when its all strings.
2,Not for strong chewers,"Received this product at 4:30 in the afternoon and gave it to my 7-month old Jack Russell, Whippet mix. By the time my wife arrived home an hour later, the dog had already chewed through the black fabric on the top and bottom of the hose and the toy had to be thrown away. Granted, it lasted a lot long than some of the other toys I've brought home, but this is definitely not a toy a toy you should buy if your dog is like mine and somehow manages to chew the tops off of Nylabones."
2,Not For Big Dogs,"I have been looking for a tough toy for my 10 month old 65 lb Ridgeback. This toy seemed like a good idea but it lasted about 2 hours before all the stuffing was torn out of it. Stitching at the ends was fine, she just tore right through the fire hose. I thought maybe I had a bad one but after reading other review it looks like this toy, despite being called ""hard core"", should only be bought for smaller dogs that dot like to chew through things. Next"
1,Not a Tough Toy At All!!!!!,I have a German Shepherd and he tore through this supposedly tough toy in 20 minutes. He had the guts all over the floor. What a waist of money. Don't waist your money. Buy a Kong Toy instaed they will last forever.
1,Destroyed in less than a half hour,"Our lab/Australian shepherd mix is a very tough chewer. I thought, being made of fire hose, this toy would last awhile. She had a corner chewed off and the squeaker out in less than a half hour. Don't waste your money if you think this will hold up to a tough chewer!"
1,Destroyed within 5 minutes,"Well, just received this today and gave it to my 10 month old golden retriever. He chewed off a hole on the bottom within 5 minutes! Complete waste of money!"
2,Not particularly tough,"I purchased this as a present for my friend's dog (who is a prodigious destroyer of toys) in hopes that it would drive my friend nuts with indestructible squeakiness2 drawbacks to the planFirst, the toy is not very squeaky - the squeaker is stuffed in one end mostly under the stitching, so it's almost impossible for the dog to get it to make noise while playing with itSecond, the toy is pretty far from indestructible - I suppose the double stitched whatever with no exposed something or anothers might have increased its lifetime by a couple hours, but the toy didn't last more than a day or so before the end had been ripped off (and it started to unravel) - see the customer picture with the well-manicured hand holding it for an example"
5,Fire hose squeak & fetch toy,"Great product. My dog had this toy before, and loved it until she eventually pulled it apart. It lasted longer than any other toy I have ever gotten for her. It is incerdibly durable, being that it is made from real fire hose material, so I decided to order her a new one. My dog is a husky mix, weighs about 50-60 lbs and she is an avid chewer."
4,Firehose Squeak Toy,"I bought the Firehose toy for my Lab as a last resort, as she loves toys but has chewed through even the toughest of the Tuffy Dog Toys. She managed to chew through a corner and get the squeaker out in under 30 minutes BUT that is as far as she went. This toy has lasted longer than any other toy we have purchased for her-and we've gone through alot of them. It's a great fetch toy too. I will probably buy another since she dropped this one in the woods somewhere while carrying it around.............gotta love labs."
1,Fire hose? Really?,My 47 pound Springer Spaniel had this apart in under 10 min. I would not recommend it for any aggressive chewers.
1,Misleading picture,"This item does not have the pull cord. The one shipped to me is just the red hose part. It is durable, but I would have bought a different one because I my dog likes to play tug."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought 2 (medium and small) for my 2 dogs (medium - Irish water spaniel and small - terrier).Within 1 1/2 hours, the medium one was totally destroyed and the other one damaged."
5,Outstanding annecdotes on the Oracle,"Warren Buffett, the American Icon, is captured beautifully in these 1500some pages. The book is a haphazard collection of notes, annecdotes, rumors and stories of the Oracle himself. It contains much of the traditional folk wisdom of the man, as well as much of the lore you probably haven't heard yet. At 1500 pages, there's something for everyone.The book is a must for any member of the cult of Warren."
3,poor lost orphan girl,"Mary Giaccio(her sirname changes alot of times during the series due to being a foster kid)will not stop hanging around Jessica and Elizabeth's mother,and ignores the twins!Hot-headed Jessica becomes VERY very ticked off!They soon feel very sorry for Mary when they realize that the reason she spends so much time with Mrs Wakefield is that Mary misses her own mother.Will Mary ever find her own mum again?"
4,Excellent popular book on astronomy,"The book gives a clearly written, easily understandable account of some aspects of modern astronomy. The authors pays much attention in using simple words and phrasing. Beautiful illustrations and sketches. Worth reading."
4,A great book for Great Lakes Fishes,"This has for years been one of the great regional fish books of the United States. This revised edition with the addition of distribution maps, more illustrations showing important ID features, the photos placed within the pages of text and many more quality color illustrations have made this book much more user friendly. The rewritten text gives much more information than the original book contained. This book will be of great use to fisherman, those with a interest in the wildlife of this region and serious student of fishes. If you live in the Great Lakes area and are interested in fishes this book is a necessity."
4,Great for Biologists,"Extensive keys, moderately technical but illustrated, and with a glossary. Each fish has a short description, range map within the Great Lakes Region, description of range beyond the Great lakes, habitat, and black and white photo. Colour plates, a mix of photos and drawings, at the end of the book. Appendix with ""Diagnostic shapes and pigment patterns of larvae of some species."" This will be of interest to students of biology and those who are really interested in fish of teh region."
3,The best of Haitink's disappointing Ring,"You can't make a Ring cycle just because you want to. In the absence of a passalbe, not to say inspiring, Brunnhilde and Siegfried, Haitink's cycle was sunk from the start. But neither of them appear in Das Rheingold, so the singers here are good enough, and in James Morris we have the best Wotan of his generation. I would rate this set higher except that the orchestra is no great shakes and Haitink, then a newbie to Wagner conducting, lapses back into his duller mode of straightforward, unimaginative leadership. All in all, this Rheingold is about equal to Levine's contemporaneous one on DG, which is marred by eccentrically slow tempi."
3,Ordinary orchestra,"I got this CD at a great price, but despite a few gems among the soloists (Goldberg, Studer and especially Morris), it seems I got what I paid for. Recording sounds two-dimensional and suffers throughout from poor intonation and lack of synchornization from the conductor. Feels particularly slow at times; maybe Haitink is trying for a grandiouse effect, but it falls flat. Brass is especially weak and muddy."
5,Just love those Greek islands,Excellent stuff! The best Greek islands guide I have seen or read. I really love those insights to the out of the way beaches and restaurants that the other guidebook publishers just seem to miss. Top notch writing.AK - Athens
5,a great book,"i've just come back from greek. during the trip, i went to santorini, mykonos and crete. the guide help us a lot. the hotels and restaurants recommanded are really great! the maps are useful too. one thing i want to add is ""don't try the olympic hotel in rethyno(crete)"" because the staff there are not honest, and they just say 'forget about it' for their error!"
2,Not what I needed for this cruise,"I usually find Lonely Planet guides very helpful but not this time. Our cruise stopped at seven ports in Greece and I had hoped to use this as a self-guide to avoid the exorbitant prices of the shipped-planned excursions. Three of our ports (Naplion, Gythion, Pylos) were not in the book at all or barely mentioned. In the book's defense, I will say that these towns were ports on the Peloponesian peninsula, not islands. If you're doing more than Athens and islands, I would get another guide that's more inclusive."
1,Dissapoint for this book,"I read the recommendation from Amazon, who recommend reader to buy ""Lonely planet island"" and ""Lonely Planet Greece"" together.However, I found the book of "" Greece"" is enough!! Because you can find enough information of islands in the book of ""Greece"", you needn't to buy the book of ""Greek Island"" again! I am not happy for the recommendation from Amazon, which is difficult for me to trust it again!"
2,"Love Lonely Planet, but...","While usually a great fan of Lonely Planet guides, I found other Greek Islands guides to top this one. I found The Rough Guide to contain more (and better) information and detail on a greater number of villages. Some island villages which looked interesting to me would not be even mentioned in the Lonely Planet guide, yet would be in The Rough Guide. As well, I found the Cadogan (Dana Facaros) Greek Islands guide, while not completely written for the backpacker to be more helpful, with all of the basic information needed, fantastic writing and a satisfactory Athens chapter. I hope they improve the Lonely Planet Greek Islands guide as they're a wonderful outfit, but I'd pass on this one."
2,Buy another. Disappointing,Lack of information is the big feature of this guide. Where to eat and stay is the worst thing in this book. So if you think to choose a hotel or restaurant forget it! Choose another guide. Lack of criticism concerning sights and places to visit is another minus point. Lonely Planet guides are very narrative. Like Frommer`s guides these guides should rate sights and places.
2,Disappointing for a Lonely Planet book!,"I own a LOT of Lonely Planet travel guides and have always been happy with the insider information they provide. This book, however, is lacking in MANY ways. First of all, there are hardly any photos. Secondly, it seems like the same island description has been pasted onto each island. It goes something like this, "" This is one of the most beautiful islands...."". Lastly, it falls way short in hotel listing. In Mykonos, for example, the book only list 3 hotels in budget, 3 in medium price range, and 3 deluxe hotels. You've got to be kidding! All that's listed as far as excursions in Mykonos is the number of a travel agent and a gay cruise. Sorry,..not interested...in either!! I want descriptions and suggestions. Did Lonely Planet really ever visit all of these islands? VERY disappointing!"
2,Use Let's Go Greece,"I used this book for Crete and Santorini and it just didn't get the job done. Fortunately, I had Let's Go Greece 2005 with me as well. It had much more accurate and useful information, at least for the the two aformentioned islands.LP Greek Islands is useful for keeping your Athens cafe table from wobbling, though. So, it has that going for it."
4,Opinions about Lonely Planet Greek Guide,I have been hopping in Greek islands 3 times now and I have had plenty of guide books with me. This was simply the best. There was hardly any old information like in other books and it is enjoyably to read (text is not too small etc.)
5,great book,this is the first L.L. book i had read now ive read about 3/4 of them and im only 11 he is a great author
3,slow book,"Enjoy most L'Amour stories, but this was just repetitious. 4 CD set which could have been 3 - probably same with the book. Last CD was a lot crammed in."
2,Ridiculous.,"This isn't L'Amours worst novel but it doesn't miss by much, that honor belongs to Utah Blaine, this story is the same thing over and over, the good guy gets caught by the bad guys but then he gets away time after time, save your time read something else."
2,Not Great Quality!,"This TV was not what I had expected. When it arrived, it was packaged well but had a damaged exterior plastic piece on the side of the TV.The TV also has a light on the front of it(power indicator) that is on even when it's pluged in and not acctually turned on.This TV obviously has problems but it's not worth returning to Amazon.Plus, just days after I purchased it, it was marked down $20 cheaper...Figures!"
5,TV,This was one of the best deals I ever got on Amazon.com! It is still working and the quality is beyond some of other manufactures.
5,"Great TV, awesome price!","Really cute TV, great price for $35 on sale. It is definately a blue and npot a purple like others have said. I use it in my sons room and he loves it! Kid friendly remote too!"
2,Authentic but without joy,"To my mind, a carol album should be moving -- pulling (however gently) on those moving emotions of the joyous season.I found the music on this album authentic but lacking the joy or spirit of the other Christmas albums I've heard such as the Waverly Consort Christmas, Deller's eclectic Holly and the Ivy, or Anonymous 4's On Yoolis Night."
4,Overall a very good classical Christmas CD,"I've really enjoyed the CD. All songs are set very authentically; i.e. - Silent Night is sung by two male vocals with choir and organ as backup, much the same way it was likely sung the first Christmas Eve it was written.The only issue I have with the CD is the first song is recorded VERY, VERY, quietly such that I can't even hear it with my normal volume setting. However, the length and quality of the rest of the CD more than compensates: 62 minutes with 24 songs."
5,This CD is da' bomb!!!,When I first saw the movie Titanic I went out and bought Celine Dion's Let's Talk About Love. I really hadn't even heard any of the other songs before. After listening the first time to the heart filled songs I fell in love with the lyrics and tunes. The lyrics to her songs have so much meaning and are so deep. I really enjoy listening to her songs and the way they make me feel. Not many songs such as these can touch someone as much as this particular one did to me. I feel that if you want to get a CD with meaning and something that you will understand get this one. It's the best!!!
4,Fascinating,This is a very interesting bk but maybe he should talk more about the running (after all it is the 4 min mile) and introduce his characters before he starts to talk about them.
4,Great Adventure!,I love a history lesson but to read these pages which were written over 50 years ago about the event itself was amazing. Bannister writes very well and I am happy to say that I too am a runner...I could only imagine the struggle he went through to break that barrier.Every distance runner should read this book for motivation.
5,indispensable,"This is a lovely recital -- Hendricks at the height of her powers, singing music she was born to sing, idiomatically and with a gorgeous shimmer to the voice and insinuating inflections that convey Faure's quite particular combination of chaste reserve and sensuality. The famous cycle ""La bonne Chanson"" may not have all the textual acuity of its recorded rivals, but Hendricks' version of ""Les roses d'Ispahan"" is worth the price of the disk many times over."
5,Not By Accident,It is a very practical help and guideline for anyone who has suddenly had one of their children killed or dying. It gives a much needed perspective for all who will take a few minutes to read this book...
5,Romantic story that lingers like a sad song.,I have read several of Fern Smith-Brown's novels and this is one of her best. A wonderful blend of romance and historical fiction. Give us more!
5,Touching...,"This was such a beautifully told story. Smith-Brown is a wonderful writter. I happened upon an on-line review for this book and was intrigued, however when I went to buy it was dissapointed to find that it was out of print. I can't know why, this book was very good. THANK GOD my local library had a copy, granted they only had one. I plan to write the publisher to see if I can get a copy of my own. I also plan to find out what else Smith-Brown has written.Take the time to read this one. The story of Tilda and James will touch your heart."
4,Good read on Yuma history and local events.,"A biography always has a way of including many other local histories, events and names. Though not always historicaly correct, and some names may have been changed to protect the ???, this book is a great read. If you are interested in Yuma or Southwest history, add this to your collection."
4,Dalton Higgins,"It's funny how you put out your review without understanding who you are even writing about. First of all, Bobby Digital is what RZA considers his alter ego. He explained many moons ago my friend that he was putting out tracks under this alter ego. This content was from his youthful days. Basically before he had matured... The album is on time though..and the beats are intuitive."
3,Attention! this bullet is more Analog than Digital.,"This albumn comes with the imagination and sick lyrics that you are craving for, but only does so on half of the tracks. A solid half of this albumn is garbage with recycled beats, stupid non-sensical raps, and shoddy production. The other half of the albumn is bulletproof RZA genius, that only his fans understand. Quick witty raps that reach all subjects yet come together into goofy fury. Meth hits on a few tracks, and Domestic Viloence part II sees RZA rapping dirty south. Its a shame he can't follow through. This albumn is not worth the purchase, if you don't have the first Bobby Digital buy that instead."
3,WuTang 4 ever !!,Now for all those hating on good music. Stop that. This album is the sound of the culture. Bobby Digi really repin it this time. This album is definetly a banger. Any one who loves real Hip Hop will pick this album up fo real. Yall show ur love to the Clan.ONEManChu 2010
4,DO-DO-DO-DO-DO-DO-DO-DO-DO-DO...BONG BONG - BONG BONG...,"I GOT IT THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT. IT'S BETTER THAN THE FIRST BOBBY DIGITAL...I THINK. HE CAME WITH BETTER BEATS THIS TIME...I THINK. IF U LIKED THE RETARDEDNESS OF THE FIRST ONE, U WILL LAUGH AT THIS DIGITAL BULLET ALBUM CUZ ITS JUST HILARIOUS. THE BEATS AREN'T REALLY MUSICAL, JUST FUNNY TO LISTEN TO."
2,Soggy like old toast,"A weak effort from someone who can do (and has done) a whole lot better. The misogyny alone is nauseating. There are a few good cuts on the disk, but not enough to warrant buying it."
2,Aother failure from the washed up Wu-Tang frontman,"Anything associated with Wu-Tang in the past several years just comes short of anything that sounds worth listening to, let alone purchasing, they completely fell off and don't know when to give up, or catch up with the rest of the hip-hop industry. I used to be the biggest RZA fan, now he just throws some noises together and calls it a CD, Do not waste your money on this heartless failed effort, or any other Wu-Tang member's CD. The RZA had his moment years ago, and now his beats are just good for a laugh compared to real producers like Dr Dre, Neptunes, Timberland, Fred Wreck, Battlecat and so on."
2,Fallen Off,"Totally unimaginative and there are no insightful lyrics that you would usually find in a Wu-Tang recording. This was definitely meant to be more of and experimental album, like all RZA tracks, but this is a mad-creation gone bad. For some good Wu-Tang material to get it back like their glory days check out Killah Priest's Priesthood."
2,...for three days now and I don't even listen to it anymore,"...this one is about on par with the first bobby digital album, so if you really felt that one, by all means, buy this one. I wasn't really disappointed since I wasn't expecting much. Tracks 12 onward are actually mediocre (but not good enough to learn their names), and throw your flag up borders on good. If you buy lots of CD's and still think the wu haven't fallen off, you'll get this anyway. If you're discriminating, don't waste your money; wait for the new ghostface if you need your wu. Better yet, get the Yesterdays New Quintet album when it drops on the 18th..."
5,KANAWA WOWS ME WITH HER VOWELS,"Italian has to be the best language for opera singers. The beautiful Kiri Te Kanawa sings soulfully of love, family, and tenderness. I listen to CD opera on Saturdays because I can't readily get public radio. This is not tragic stuff. Puccini in Turandot turns out effortless beauty. I am anticipating a heavier Verdi. Il Trovatore and La Traviata have to be everyone's favorites. I like the lyric soprano and mezzosoprano. If I wanted to hear shreaking, I'd have stayed married. Not really, but it is a good line."
5,great starter for residents fans,actually petting zoo is better as a starter maybe the icky flix dvd should be the perfect introduction to the residentsthis album you never get tired ofbuy the original 40 track releasethe residents are one of the greatest bands of all timeconcept behind album is deconstructing pop musicbuy or diegeocities.com/cradlebait
4,Berdan decapper,This is a decent product but could be re-engineered. Becareful with the tip as they are fragile. It broke after ten primer's. RCBS sent two to replace it no problem. It needs to set just right or you will have problem's.
2,mini bears stairs,this is too narrow for my dog to use. the steps need to be set in deeper for him to be able to use it. however my cat seems to like them but really has no need for stairs yet.
3,When giants walked the earth.,"There's never been a Blue Oyster Cult album that hasn't had songs on it that make it worth listening to, if not purchasing outright. The first four songs on CULTOSAURUS ERECTUS are the four main keepers on this one, particularly ""Monsters,"" which owes more than a little in it's execution to ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" by King Crimson, and has several tasty sax solos in it as well. After those four are three so-so tracks that aren't so much bad as boring, but much interest is restored with the final two tracks, ""Lips In The Hills"" and ""Unknown Tongue,"" leaving the album in the end with much metal heft. This is not the complete snooze-fest the album before it was (MIRRORS), but it's nowhere near as fulfilling a music experience as TYRANNY AND MUTATION and SECRET TREATIES are and were. And no cowbell, either!"
1,searching for base,"We have these phones. Now I am looking for something else. At least every other week it will cut off a caller when you try to answer the phone. It displays ""searching for base."" It doesn't matter if it was in the base to start with or even if you put it back!"
4,Great phone for the money,"I just got three of these phones to use with the VTech 2461 telephone answering machine. They are well worth the money (especially with the rebate). Only two complaints, both of which are not major enough for me to get upset about given the features of this telephone: 1) Some light static on the line (the people are the other end do not hear this; they say the phone sounds great), and 2) The keypad buttons used to dial are very small.I have three 900MHz Panasonic portable phones in my house, all different. They all have the same problem-- after 1 year of use, none of them allows more than 15 minutes of talk time, or if not on their charger base, will last for more than a day.Since I have a 61 year old house with few phone jacks located in inconvenient places, this phone system has proven to be ideal for my needs. Seems that many people have had problems with the Siemens' phones, which is why I avoided those."
5,The Best,Probably the finest cordless phone available. It has everything you could want in a phone. Each handset works as a speaker phone and is clear for both you the called party. One base station can handle 4 seperate phones. Each of the phones can be called individually or as a group.
5,The best reason to buy the 2420 system,"The ability to add handsets is one of the best features of the 2420 system. Setting up new handsets is nearly effortless: just enter the numbers on the bottom of the base unit to register, and it's working. You immediately get the ability to page between handsets, not to mention all the other great features of the 2420."
2,Planned Obsolescence,"The phone works well, looks great. But the keypad wears out in about a year or so of normal home use. Pathetic. I have bought numerous additional handsets to replace the worn out ones, but now they are so expensive it makes more sense to bite the bullet and go get an entirely new system. I would not buy vtech again."
3,1 thing wrong & had to return,"I had the 2.4 w/digital ans with caller ID/call waiting. I loved how compact it was and liked its features. The answering machine was the best part of the phone. Unfortunatly the phone had a constant vibration noise even though the volume was at its lowest. Everytime I said a word or the person on the other end spoke, I heard this vibrating buzz like that of playing a loud noise infront of a drum (the vibrating noise that the skins make). I wasn't talking loud or anything yet it was constant. I would change the channels constantly and nothing. I did everything possible but nothing changed. So I had to return it."
3,Great phone bad price,I love this phone. I especially like the fact that you don't have to plug it into a phone jack. You save 50 dollars on every site though. Do not think you are getting a good deal here. It isischeaper on the vtech site. (sorry Amazon)
1,"All of the features I want, but constant static ruins use","I purchased the 40-2421 base unit and an additional 2420 hand unit (for 2 hand units total), and the phone does indeed come with all of the functionality I wanted, but the constant relatively loud statis hiss makes the phone virtually unusable.I have contacted vtech technical support, and hope the problem can easily be resolved, but be forwarned, while some people have not experienced the static problem, it does occur, so be prepared to deal with support or to return the phone."
5,Works as described - but beware scaleless fish,"A 7-day course of this stuff definitely got rid of the ich. The betta fish tolerated it well - if it bothered them, they didnt show it.However, I'm guessing it killed my two ottos. The warning says that scaleless fish could be susceptible to treatment - they were right."
3,"Not as bad as some people say, but not great.","Hearing some not-too-pleasant things about Harle's playing, I was somewhat surprised by the quality of the recording. It's not as bad of a recording as some people say (largely on account of the superb orchestra), but Harle is hardly the reincarnation of Mule and Rascher. Harle's tone is average (could be a lot warmer and darker), technique is average, interpretations are average. In general, a CD that will sit there while I listen to Gwozdz or Sinta. Harle's soprano playing is awful, so is his altissimo register. Still not as bad as it could be (Harvey Pittel anyone...?)"
1,Grat success for an awful playing,"Why is this low level saxophonist so well-succeeded with famous cd-labels? It's a mystery, but maybe because he has good and well-placed friends. Anyway, it's a very bad playing, a poor sound, a vulgar technique, and I won't waste my time talking about interpretation, 'cause there isn't any. I own this CD and I find it very useful to show students how they shouldn't play. Or how a great company like EMI can have such bad recordings (hear the Glazunov's cadenza, for instance). For his fans, I can recommend hearing people like Fourmeau, Delangle, or some young saxophonists like Vincent David and Alexandre Doisy, or, if you don't like french saxophonists, you may try Bornkamp (dutch), Sugawa (japanese), Rousseau, Murphy (american), among many others from various countries who really know how to make music with the saxophone."
2,"There are really good classical saxophonists, too, you know?","It's very important that people know there's much more in saxophone music than jazz and rock music. But there are better ways of doing it than John Harle's cold and empty playing. It's a pitty, with such a good orchestra."
4,Nice :),I ordered this for my pinky and it fits great and looks good + it hasnt given me a rash yet :D
2,Highlights not full recording,"I was dissapointed when I got this to find it was not the complete opera. There is no indication in the title that it is only the highlights. But if you look on the track listing they say hightlights. It has only one disc not 2 as stated in the product description. There are some strange fad-outs between selections and one of the most famous songs ""I Loves you Porgy"" is missing. There is enough there to get me to want to buy the full opera even though I am not a fan of opera.The full opera is called ""Gershwin: Porgy and Bess"" Original Recording Remastered EMI 2005. It has 3 discs."
1,Incorrect Product Description,"This is not the textbook. All reviews and information indicate that this product is the actual textbook, however, it is the study guide. Therefore I suggest buying this only if you are looking for the study guide."
2,study guide,haven't used the guide yet. still need the book. wish study guide was listed in the title on amazon so i could have bught the book as well. amazon listed the book as the paperback version of the hardcopy
4,Good aide,"I had this book in my summer microbiology class. Granted, at least 25% of it was not related to what my teacher was teaching us, but it sure helped to reinforce the parts we did go over!"
2,Caution: This is not the Textbook!,"Be aware that this is NOT the textbook, it is the Study Guide! Although it may be useful for you (we decided to keep it anyway), it isn't what the title says."
2,Poor reproduction,"Sadly the print is dim and hard to read. If you are poring over a rare first edition it is easy to forgive, but in a reproduction you would expect better. An ink shortage at the University of Kentucky?"
3,Southern Harmony,"Having become interested in the shape note singing music several years ago, I found several sources online where i could listen to examples. The main sources are 'Sacred Harp' and 'Southern Harmony'. I felt the need to have both of these resources available to better understand the concept. I already had a 'Sacred Harp' but found it not inclusive of material from other sources, especially 'Southern Harmony', which is why I purchased it. What surprised me was the printed scores appear to be a facsimile of the original, some pages seem to be a bit fzzy or out of focus. All in all, i am sill pleased with my purchase."
4,Classic text with CD,"The CD included with this version features classic backwoods singing, Kentucky-style (my roots)...not all easy listening, that's for sure, but certainly historically accurate. A worthwhile addition to my music library."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this battery in July 2010. It worked well when I first received it. However, it's performance has steadily declined until it is now completely dead in February 2011. Spend a little extra and get a quality product. Do not purchase this battery."
1,Something is wrong,"I bought this battery directly from Fastmac over nearly four months ago.The first battery would not hold a charge and took forever to recharge. I returned it to Fastmac. They sent me another. Same problem. I returned it, and the sent a third battery. Same problem.I did every bit of troubleshooting I could, even going so far as to take my laptop into Apple. There were no problems with my Macbook Pro 17"", and now a new Apple brand battery is now working fine.Fastmac could not identify the problem, and insinuated that I was actually trying to cheat them for some reason (huh!?). After weeks of back-and-forth, they finally issued a refund -- minus a 20% restocking fee.Buyer beware. I am not the type who ever posts reviews, but my experience with this product was frustrating to say the least. I recommend you avoid Fastmac."
3,Sturdy kneeler...everything else so so,the kneeler is great on the knees but rest of the product does not stay assembled very well. the storage for bath toys is small and the guard seems unnecessary.
2,Another so-so product from Safety First,"The kneeling stool is great. The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful! BUT...the elbow pad is a joke! There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic. Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all. It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it. I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail."
1,tubside problem,i bought this before my baby was born and thought is was a dream. then i tried using it. it put me up to high from the tub and made my back hurt bending over further. also if i didn't have my arms on the top it would constantly fall off. it only took me a week to take this item back. don't waste your time or money on this one.
3,My back started aching,"I like the idea of this kneeler; the arm cushion is a great idea and so is the cushion for the knees. It has a cute design and pockets are always a plus. However, in practical terms, I was a little disappointed by this product.First, once I unfolded and snapped the arm section into place, it was impossible to release it to return it to its folded position, which makes storing it cumbersome.The stool/kneeler is sturdy, but I found that instead of being helpful for my back, it actually caused my back to hurt much more quickly. It placed me so high above my daughter, I ended up bending over even more to bathe her.In the longrun, I don't really use this much as a whole product. It will be a great stool for my daughter someday, but that's quite a long, long way off since she is now only a baby. I actually use my ""Safe Bather"" cushion to support my knees and then use the arm section of this product to protect and cushion my elbows."
1,Not sturdy,"The kneeler is not very sturdy. I was not comfortable kneeling on it, and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam-like cushion. If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning, I'm not impressed. I might as well kneel on a folded towel. I was hoping for something that would be soft. Also, the construction of the item is not very sturdy. It is made of plastic, and it does not seem at all durable. The elbow ""cushion"" is also not very soft. It is not secure, either. When I leaned against it to test it, it slid right off. If I'd been busy bathing my baby, I would have tumbled into the tub with him. I don't recommend this product."
1,Will not stay attached,"This is definetly not worth buying. It will not stay attached to the tub and falls down while bathing. While bathing, it places you too high to reach down to bathe your infant."
4,Save your back,"This is a lifesaver. When giving the baby or in my case babies a bath, one cannot expect to be completely comfortable. I was struggling with back issues until I got this. It has helped quite a bit. I have even incorporated a small squat routine using this aparatus while bathing the girls. Silly I know, but we have to find time to exercise somewhere."
2,Very Uncomfortable,"Not only does this kneeler fall off of the tub whenever it wants, it is not high enough and very combersome to use. Its cheaper and more comfortable to fold a big fluffy towel next to the tub. HOWEVER, the step stool will be great when my son gets bigger."
