1,save your money,bad movie ..trailer was the best part of the movie watch the trailer and you have seen the best part of the film save your money...
5,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre was a very well written book. The book is written by Charlotte Bronte. The book is written in the third person and the author's style is wonderful. Jane is a girl in the beginning and is about five years old. The book explains all about Jane and all of the good and bad events throughout her life. When she becomes a woman, her life gets very exciting and full of adventures.I don't want to give away anything more about the book. I highly recommend Jane Eyre to any young person who has a large vocabulary or has very good dictionary skills, or any adult, so they can understand it. This is certainly a reading challenge, but if you ask anyone who read it, they'll say they loved it!"
5,Loved it,I had to read this book for a class and loved it!!! I got the free Audible version too and the narration was wonderful!!!
2,words are small,"while it's really cheap, the words are very small and there is almost no space between lines...I would rather just pay a few bucks more and have a more pleasant reading experience."
4,Wonderful classic and love story!,"Not being a very avid reader of the classics I was quite surprised at the relevance of the story to the fiction of today, but masterfully written! As a 28 year old guy I'm not usually accustomed to picking something like this up, but at the encouragement of my wife and the audio book available I was welcome to the opportunity of reading/ listening to it. All in all I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone looking to expand their language and or their list of great books to read."
3,AP English Book,"Jane Eyre is a title set in times where the rich had nothing but literature, so the language is going to be long-winded, and the plot is irregular for its time. It contains some aspects of our modern literature but the antics from its time of origin.As a book for AP English, I would rather have selected another book, but this is not the worst. Most readers will fare better in this book for school rather than the infamous ""Invisible Man"" and other commonly used senior lit. books.Be prepared for a long read, as JE is definitely longer than what a modern book usually will be. Otherwise, read away - this book has its own unique style that is interesting in all its own."
5,The most romantic book ever,"I suppose it's needless to review the story. It's nice to get a copy of Jane Eyre on my Kindle - I like re-reading bits from this book from time to time, it's kind of inspirational. This edition's minor (and - it seems to me - the only) shortcoming is the impossibility of going to any specific chapter via ""go to"" option."
3,Not for everyone.,If you like biography books than this is a good book for you. I was looking for romance and some action.
5,Beautiful,"Definitely one of my favorite books of all time. Beautifully crafted, sweeping in its majesty, an unforgettable story. No surprise it's a classic!"
5,A tried and true classic,I spent part of my summer revisiting old favorites. Years have gone by since I read Jane Eyre. I couldn't put the Kindle down. I can really say that the time spent with Jane Eyre was a bright spot in my summer.
5,Interesting,I downloaded this book after I kept seeing it mentioned in the Fifty Shades series. This book is 'old school' but very ineteresting and I'm glad to say I have now read it. It was difficult for me to put down at times and at times I needed to put it down just to process what I had read. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys reading for the sake of reading and who can handle 'deep' reading. If you've not read a lot of classic books this is a good start to add one to your list.
2,Dull And Disapointing.....,"Maybe Jane Eyre is just not ment to be a book for teens, but whatever the case... I found it the worst book I ever read. Jane Eyre, like all other books, has it's good parts.. But most of the time, it was just plain dull. Deffiantly don't read it if you are a teen simply looking for an exciting read. This book is a dull and boring young adult book... But maybe thats just my opinion."
1,Completely Tattered,"When this book came it was supposed to be ""gently used"" but as I was reading it, the binding kept falling apart. And the pages were completely sun-baked and brittle which made them tear really easily. I was not happy with this purchase."
1,Pointless,"I was forced to read this for english because apparently that's what it takes to be somebody in life. (Sarcasm at its finest.) I would rather stare at a Big Mac than read this book, and I can't stand McDonalds. Obviously, no one will read this book for pleasure, or at least no one I want to know. It's your money. Do what you want with it."
5,"try it, you might like it!","I read this about two years ago, and was initially put off by it's length and the fact it was 'a classic'. Really, though, once you get into it you are in for a treat. The book is an emotional rollacoaster, and though it was written more than a hundred and fifty years ago (I think) it still heldgreat resonance for me; I too could identify with Jane Eyre's dilema over the cerbral duty prescribed by her mind and the emotinal neccessity calling out from her heart. The chemistry between her and Rochester blows away anything you'd see on the cinema screen, and the passages where they are together practically set the pages on fire. I guess it's down to the readers temperment in the end, wether or not they emaphise, and the style is nuanced and therefore could be thought overly wordy ocaissionally, but if you like reading this is such a good book to try. Some people say it's the best novel ever written in english; I'd be inclined to believe them."
4,Good,"I had to read this book this summer for a school assignment. This was a great coming-of-age book in the 1800s. I found it rather interesting. My mom said I'd like it if I liked Little Women (which I totally despised). This story was about a girl named Jane Eyre from when she was in her aunt's orphanage 'till she married. She was abused at her aut's orphange. Soon she went of to Lowood's School for Girls and became a teacher for her last 2 years. She then became a governess at Thornfield after she left school. Soon, she fell in love with the master of the place. Then, she left and became poor and homeless, but then found a job from the person she stayed with and a lot of other things happened, but that's all I'll tell you, because then you won't want to read it."
2,"The book was romantic, but the begining was too slow for me.","I liked the ending of the bok, and the fact that Jane, in the end, finds happiness. The begining was too slow for me though. If you want to know what this book is about, you should read it!!"
4,Jane Eyre: Elaine Oye's Summary,"Mrs. Taylor's honors senior literature class was carefully chosen to read Jane Eyre. I truly enjoyed reading this novel because it allowed me to realize that it is not necessary to have the love of your family members or a man to depend upon. If you are confident in yourself and your abilities, then you will succeed in carrying out a happy and successful life much like Jane Eyre. She did not need beauty in order to be content with herself. This novel not only taught me many life's lessons, but also encouraged me to focus more on true happiness, not the typical worldly view of happiness."
2,jane eyre,"i thought this book was really boring. it was sad in the end, but it took so long to get to that part"
4,Better than I expected,"This novel was quite a bit better than I expected. I usually prefer adventures (""manly"" literature) but quite frankly, this book didn't disappoint me. I don't give it 5 stars for the convoluted way that Jane and Rochester get back together. The ""I heard your voice in the wind"" stuff is a little hard to swallow. (Sorry if that was a spoiler! Still read the book because there are some true heart-pounding moments!) Jane Eyre was actually quite enjoyable to read and I'm glad that I took the time to read it. I like her character: She's not beautiful, but she's a solid and determined woman and I like that her inner beauty overcomes her physical plainness. She's a role model for young girls! She overcomes adversity with strength and determination and has an accurate moral compass. She follows her inner voice and she's rewarded for it. Great female literary character of the 19th century!"
4,A good book,"I thought this was a nice book. The main character is unlike most heroines. She is plain and simple, not very elegant or beautiful. It is fun to read about two characters, Jane Eyre, with her kind and charming but simple personality and the moody and mysterious Mr. Rochester. It can be a bit long with details but this book keeps you interested. I especially liked that Charlotte Bronte told you all about each character and how they grow and change or do not change. I thought this was a great story and is worth reading if you like love stories."
5,What are you talking about?,"I read an abridged version of this book for the first time in 6th grade and the full version of it in 10th and i absolutely loved it both times. Jane Eyre IS suitable for young readers and i am sure that many will enjoy it. A great novel and a beautiful love story, truly a masterpiece!"
5,Excellent rendition,"Amanda Root does an excellent job of bringing the story to life. She seems to truly understand the message Charlotte Bronte communicates in her superb dialogue. This is my favorite audio CD. Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book, but rather like someone living a life. I highly recommend this audio book."
1,What a piece of crap,The only thing less exciting than this book would be watching paint dry.Stuffy english characters abound in this failed attempt to be Dickens-esque.
1,Makes for good toilet paper...,"When I ran across this title, and its lack of negative comments, I had anything but a loss for words. I will save you the bulk of my complaint, suffice it to say: I was not entertained by this work. Boring does not begin to describe this drawn out waist of bookshelf space. I got more enjoyment out of mocking the work with friends than reading it. So there you have it. I would rather fornicate with sheep than re-read this book."
5,Just Great!,"AHHHH! I simply love this book. It has been many years since I first read it, and yet, it still has the ability to sweep me away. This is a true classic in my opinion. If you have never read it, you are truly missing out on one of the most engrossing stories ever written."
5,Another Bronte Masterpeice,"However lengthy, the pages go by quick when you read this book. It's an asorbing page turner, causing you to grunt and yell aloud at the stupidity and density the two main characters seem to live on. This is thee original romance novel; introducing you to memorable characters and plotlines. It's said to be gothic, and in a sweet, quaint way it is. The narrator is a plain girl, who has morals and lives by them(however much it makes you scream). The fancied is Edward Rochester, a genius in his own right, with brilliant plans. The hidden secret-- it's a shock. (Just don't let anyone tell you beforehand). This book gets five stars, because of all it contains (or, rather, because it leaves out nothing a great novel should have)."
5,Buy This Book. Why?,"Because people who don't like this book are stupid poopheads. It's just that simple. Jane Eyre is a classic, not only of Victorian literature, but of all time. You must love it; and if you can't, there's something clearly wrong with you."
5,WARNING....,"This is my absolute favorite book! WARNING:it starts out slow, but stay with it and you will find this to be an excellent book. If you like classics and romance (clean romance) this is the book for you."
4,story is beautifully written,I just didn't have the TIME in my life to properly enjoy it. If you have all day to read - this is a Great One for you!!!
4,Love this book!,"The language, the indefatiguable love story, the tying up loose ends. Wholly satisfying! I enjoy comparing the book to the movies."
5,Fabulous uplifting entertainment,I have always wanted to read this book. It was an easy read and I didn't want to put it down. I plan on reading more classics like this. The storyline is so much more involved than the movie was.
5,THIS is great English Literature,"A touching novel of a poor orphant blossoming into an intelligent governess, falling in love, falling for the wrong reason. Then just when you think it would never happen, Jane Eyre finds true love."
5,A magnificent read,Dive in and take hold of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. Bronte weaves a wonderful tale full of dark monsters and white knights. Let the fairy tale unfold in your hands. You won't regret your time lost between the pages.
4,Classic,"The book is a well known classic that i thought I'd read. It was very good. Lots of passion, anger, jealousy, love. Beautifully written."
4,Hmm,Had to read this book for lit class..for me it was too much information..it talks about all of her life(child-adult) in too much detail..okay yes her stay with her aunt and her time at school was important but goodness get on with the story..a summary of that time would've been nice..the book is still good and this is a good copy to get
4,Rereading the classics,"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Jane Eyre is one of those books. It wasn't a quick read, and it did drag on at times. Honestlyh, I thought to myself quite often, ""What amd I doing reading a gothic romance"", but I carried on. I had also seen the 2011 movie adaptation (which I also recommend) and wanted to fill in the missing pieces. I also wondered what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a young person (teenager)? I probably would have hated it! I'm glad I read it this summer as upon reflection I did enjoy this Bronte novel. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."
4,Good,Got this book for my daughter. She read the book and then we had to go rent the movie. Good story.
5,Jane Eyre,"This is such a great book. It is long (by today's standards) but there is such real feeling and flowing language. It's easy to get lost in this book. I both want to finish it so I know the ending, and have it go on longer, because it was such an engrossing read."
4,Good book,Excited to start reading it on my tablet. Ordered it and was easy to do on my new tablet. Thanks
4,Classic.,"Even though it's not Pride and Prejudice, it's always good to read a classic. At least she gets the guy in the end."
5,Finally,"I knew nothing of this book but that it was a classic and thought, ""I should read it."" I thoroughly enjoyed it and intend to read more classics that I should have years ago."
4,Decent and heartfelt book,I think the reason this book is such a great read is the fact that Jane is an amazing and quite easily remarkable character. I chose this novel as an independent reading in my lit class this year and feel that it was a great choice. The book speaks to readers and makes you feel as if you are actually in the story.
1,Pretentious crap,"If I wanted something to remind me of the Victorian Era, I'd go to Ethan Allen. Freud could have fixed that psychotic period in british history"
1,Plotless,"This book was one of the worst two weeks of my life. The book had no plot and no interesting conflicts...and i HAD to read it for a high school English class...I would not reccomend this book to anyone and if you listen to alot of the ratings above that rate it good, they're obviously English teachers..."
1,Great books are illusions,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
2,Meaningless,"Perhaps this book requires a re-read, but I found this novel to be full of meaningless drivel. The characters to me were uninspiring, there was not enough real heartache that you felt. The characters were simply underdeveloped. The plot with St. John seemed uterally meaningless to me.This is one of my least favourite books-- there was no substance, no overwhelming theme. Nothing to be learned from this book."
1,"I havnt even read it, and I know it's bad","I have to read this for my summer assignment, its due in 3 days, but Im not gonna read it...why? it looks dry as hell...so my advice? dont read it!"
1,Jane Eyre is incrediablity boring,"My freshman year in high school I had to read over the summer the book Jane Eyre. The language was so hard to understand and comprehend. I had a dictionary next to me looking up words every two minutes. The characters were extremely boring and the ending had no point to it! Everybody in my high school hated this book. We complained to the teachers that this book was so bad. It was a 200 page book that is supposedly a classic!I do not understand why high schools make people read these types of books. Nobody wants to read the book because it is not interesting to a teenager. Yeah, maybe it's a classic, but give us something interesting to read! The book is written in like old English, so I feel that when I'm done reading I have an accent when I speak! So basically if you have to ready this book, I'm so sorry because it is the worst book I have ever read!"
4,Glad I took a chance,"Ok... so truth be told, I only started to read this book because of the movie ""Definately, Maybe"". The way the character in the movie described the book made me think I might like to read it. I was not disapponted. I find that some of the ""classics"" are a bit borning and hard to follow. This one was neither. The orphaned girl hated by her family finds love. And love finds her as well. But it wouldnt make for an interesting story if there werent hills to climb. Over all I would say that this is one of those classics that has most definately earned the classification."
5,WOW,"I have read this book in Hungarian, but I know it is as good in English as in my mother language... A beautiful love story, with a remarkable young girl. It is a ""Have to read"" book!"
3,"Good story, but TOO many details","I was assigned to read Jane Eyre for school, but I did not realize that it would take me forever to read! Although many disagree, I think that Jane goes into too much detail about every single thing that goes on in her life. We could understand the story and enjoy the themes of it without reading so many detailed descriptions of unimportant things! Overall, I would recommend this book to people, but I would suggest to skip the things that do not seem important."
4,"Bronte's Jane Eyer will make you think, can you handle that?","I am a Senior in high school and I have read this book for the second time for a literary analysis I was assigned. I read this book for the first time while I was an 8th grader. I did only read it as a romance novel then. When I read it again for my paper, I experienced a paradigm shift. My point of view changed as I realized that all of the families mentioned in the book are all dysfunctional, all of them had some sort of problem. I made this my thesis. In order to get the most out of this book, you must appreciate the detail of each thought that Charlotte Bronte put into text. I think this book is an excellent classic and anyone who thinks different does not appreciate classic romantics. I think Bronte did an excellent job and hope that she knows that there are people who appreciate all of her hard work. THANKS."
5,An AMAZING Classic!,"I did not read this novel for school or for a book club; just for my pure enjoyment and did I ever enjoy it! I was a little intimidated by some of the reviews saying it was a 'romance novel' which I can't stand...but after reading it I realize, ""Yes, it is a romance novel but also a mystery and many other things!"" I am very surprised that I liked it or even bothered reading it everyday but to tell you the truth it is suspensful and intriguing. There is something about Charollet's writing that captured my imagination and the story line of Jane and Mr. Rochester is enchanting. A great romanitc/mystery/gothic novel for everyone!"
2,My English teacher is a sadist!!!,"I have to read this book for English and I can't stand it. I struggle through about twenty pages at a time, and then drop the book in boredom. I think it is interesting that all the girls in my class have absolutely no problem with it. My judgement is not entirely fair because I despise romance novels, but unless you want a book where there is only one exciting scene, and a short one at that, avoid this book!!! If you are assigned this book, however, don't panic...there are always ""Cliff's Notes"" :)"
3,Jane Eyre,"This was a Book club suggestion. Still reading, long book but a great classic. The French words are a little difficult."
5,Great!,I loved this novel. It was great enjoying a classic book as much as I enjoyed this one. I definitely want to read another one of Bronte's novels.
5,A must read for any woman wanting to hear her own voice.,"I read Jane Eyre once in high school, once in college and just now, five years later. It is a wonderful example of a book that can be read over and over again and with each reading comes a new experience. Charlotte Bronte tells a formidible tale of one woman's intellect and passions which break across ""custom"" and ""caste,"" to use Bronte's own words. Bronte wonderfully describes the inner voice of Jane which Jane instinctually values from a young age. It leads her to take extraordinary emotional risks. She does not allow herself to be shamed into behavior, nor does she shy away from her own desires and ideas. This is a book for ANY person, male or female of any color who likes a great mystery and a profound tale of human strength and experience"
3,"A little difficult, but ok","I know it's written in an older more elegant style, but I found it a little difficult to follow at times. However, I still found it interesting it just took me some time to get through it. Frankly I had to stop reading it at certain times and read another book for a chapter or two"
2,Jane,Ok. Just started. Hope navigation gets easier. I like the concept of listen and move about.. do not like the need to review...
5,Wonderful!,"Jane Eyre is never a disappointment. Bronte really can touch your heart with the struggles of the main character. A woman in the post-modern era could have easily been in the same situation. Bronte put forth a completely time-less quality in this book. If you have the patience, it can keep you nailed to your seat!!"
3,Jane Eyre,It was okay but a little dry reading. But the price you had was excellent. Going to college after all of these years I have to watch my pennies.
5,I loved this book!,"I liked everything about this book: the characters, the story, the language and the detail with which it was written. I highly recommended it."
2,slow paced,"So in the past I've read many books like this but I just don't have the willpower to finish reading this one. it is still unfinished right now and I have absolutely desire to finish it. I believe the story is really slow paced, I don't see the connection between the two, and the story didn't provoke anything at all in me that made me curious as to how it ended. over all I give this book a big thumbs down."
4,Exciting coming-of-age tale,"""Jane Eyre"" is an exciting coming-of-age tale that spans her life from age 10 to about age 30. This is a classic that I think young women will enjoy because it presents a strong heroine in Jane, who faces hardship and temptation as she grows up and later deals with romance and creating a secure, stable position in life for herself.As a man, reading the book for the first time, I enjoyed watching the story unfold through Jane's eyes. Sometimes she makes what I thought were foolish choices, but she remains true to her character. She also maintains trust in God, and I was surprised how many references there were in the book to both Bible concepts and characters."
3,19th century gothic,"Jane Eyre is a 19th-century classic, and certainly worth the reading. On the other hand, if you worry about spending the time to read a Victorian ""three-decker"", better spend it reading ""David Copperfield"" or ""Nicholas Nickleby."""
2,Eh,"I bought this book to try to relate to old classic books but it was boring and I didn't even finish it. But that is just me and I don't like these types of books, but it was free, and you might like it, so it can't hurt."
5,Very good read,"Poor Jane Eyre! I really enjoyed emersing myself in this book, it's one of those classics that we've seen at the movies or on tv many a time but the book is even better."
2,Hard to get into,"I purchase Jane Eyre on a whim. Wanted to get out of the genre I had been reading and decided on a classic. Maybe it is because it is out of my ""comfort zone"" but I could not get into reading this book."
4,Jane Eyre,A classic that has been around for generations of the past and the future. This is well-written literature that can serve as an example for current authors.
3,Jane Eyre,"This book was very depressing in the beginning. It didn't lighten until the middle, but I am glad that I finished it."
5,book review,"Jane,Eyre, Charlotte Brontie,created one of the most unforgetable heroines of all time,this novel of rommanic fiction is utimatley the tale of one womans fight to claim her independence and self-respect in societ that had no place for her. This is an excellent novel for any young woman to readit give you the courage to meat your goals and persuse your dreams much like beauty and the beast. i have enjoyed this novel thus far and i am contiuning to read as i write my review of this wounderful novel, i enjoy all of her novels but this oneis a classic a must have."
2,Missing chapter 25,"While I love this book and have reread it many times, I had to give it a low rating because the ebook is missing chapter 25. My daughter downloaded it for required reading for school and luckily noticed the oversight. I pulled out my well worn paperback so she was able to continue but be aware if you plan on downloading this book."
4,The usual life,It was a truly captivating novel. Never expected theending. Jane gives us a full account of who and what she was and hasbecome.
5,Determined to follow her conscience,"This book is full of mystery and romance. I have never read anything like it before. It really captivated me.Jane Eyre is true to what she knows is right, no matter how hard the consequences may be. She is poor and plain, yet she doesn't use that as an excuse to live with the man she loves in an improper relationship. She shows rare strength of character and wisdom when she literally runs away from temptation. She knows if she stays with Mr. Rochester, she will never be able to be truly happy, and that despite his promises to the contrary, that she will lose his respect, and she will lose her self-respect. She gives up everything to do what she knows is right, and in the end, she is rewarded in unexpected ways. I will not tell you more because I don't want to spoil it for you.Despite the lessons in this book, it is not moralistic and preachy. It is very well written, and a very enjoyable read. I would recommend it to anyone. I wish I had read it as a teenager!"
3,This book is very romantic considering the time period. love,"This is a romantic and exciting novel. However, charlotte is able to convey the feminist issue that plague all women in the 1800s and for many more centuries to come. Although, i gave this book three stars it was only because after i read the book for the second time did i get the whole idea that charllotte was trying to bring out. I think that if you read this book donot read because it is asigned to in school. Read it because you have some free time to devote to the book and then you will get the idea of the book."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a classic that I had somehow never read. It is wonderfully written, emotional and a very rewarding read. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"
5,Jane Eyre,I read Jane Eyre when I was 15 years old. That was 58 years ago. Reading it now I realize what a wonderful book this is. The use of the English language is remarkable. The way the author describes a scene so expressive and emotionally dramatic. I am glad I have reread the book at an age where I can better appreciate how wonderful it is.
5,What a wonderful book!...,"I'm just about halfway finished reading this wonderful book but had to write something about it!..I certainly have no expertise in critiquing any book, but this has got to be one of the very bestbooks I have ever read!..And, even with Bronte's old style of writing, I was just amazed at how much I've beeninvolved with her wonderful talent that allows her to come up with a story that I simplyseem to want more of with each page I read.And, when I read in ""Wikipedia"" that she died at the young age of 38, that truly saddened me a lot!..But, her blessed gift she has given all of us will continue it would seem till eternity.. for ""who can compare to Miss Bronte?..."
3,An acquired taste,"A strange read. It's hard to like a book when the main character is so odd, infuriatingly placid and unrelatable, along with incomprehensible taste in men. The first nine chapters seemed overall unnecessary in its length and read like a very depressing Anne of Green Gables. And yet I found myself caring about what happens to Jane, so I kept reading. Three stars, as despite the publisher's claim to superiority, there were many typos; especially annoying were the ones around page 175 where Rochester keeps calling her Janet."
5,After many years I finally read JANE EYRE,I have only seen the movie and I find much to my delight that th book far surpasses Hollywood's version. I can not believe that I never even considered taking the time. Now I intend to read as many of the classics as I can.
5,great shape,I received the book in a timely matter and book was in great shape and very clean. Would buy again without a doubt. Thanks
1,So very boring I very went into a coma. This was so boring I wept.,This book made me cringe. I have not been this let down in ways I could not even comply bivieve.@
3,"good, but larger than expected","I expected it to be a smaller, it was quite big, height wise, but it was still in great condition. Great story, easy print to read."
1,I really detest this book,"This was a set book for school, and I hated it. A whinny, annoying main character who spends the whole book feeling sorry for herself and moaning in misery, then falls in love with a dark, depressing, manipulative old man and can't get over him, so she gives up her life to take care of him. THIS is a model for feminism? Who wants to bet that if a man had written this, you'd never hear about it?"
1,Never recieved this book,"I guess because it was the Christmas season or something, but this and Pride and Prejudice never came. I got my other books but not those two."
1,umm,horrible book specially bcuz the language was weird. i remcommend this book to old fashioned people. la la la la
5,Great seller! Will do business with him again,The seller was fantastic! He went out of his way to get the product to me as quickly as possible. The best seller I have ever bought from. I will definately look for him on future purchases!
4,Not bad...,"Although the text doesn't really stand up to multiple readings, it's still well worth the visit the first time around."
3,umm....,"I have a good hint for all you people who have to read this or any other book for summer reading or as a class assignment. Just go to book reviews like this one and read over a couple of the reviews. That gives you the basic plot, without ever having to read the book! Wow, aren't I smart..."
2,Flawed moral,"Despite the fact that this is a classic (or considered to be a classic) and, of course, very well written, I can't understand why someone would cherish Jane Eyre's character.I don't want to give away the story for those that didn't read it. All I say is that there was an Anti-Semitic comment by Jane Eyre in the middle of the book that turned me down. I started to doubt Jane's moral and could not recover from that ignorant statement. I finished the book just to know how that story would end. I don't have any admiration for the character."
5,Outstanding.,"One of the greatest love stories ever told. If you haven't read this novel yet, you don't know what you are missing. The language is beautiful, and the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane will surely make anyone's heart melt. It will rekindle one's belief in true love. Once you read it, you will want to read it again right away! Don't miss actor Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the BBC adaptation! Also, Timothy's performance as Heathcliff in the 1970's Wuthering Heights adaptation is excellent as well! Highly Highly reccommended!!!"
3,A unique human being,"Jane Eyre, was well worth reading , I did enjoy it, but also felt it was a bit long, much could havebeen shortened."
3,Old world language hard to understand,"Story hard to follow with the ""Old World"" language. Story was interesting after you got to know the language. Unexpected ending."
1,"There has never been, and will never be, a worse book","Endless, pointless description. DESCRIPTION, DESCRIPTION, DESCRIPTION!!! The entire book is written in stupid metaphors. The few places where there is actually any dialogue bore the reader to tears. Honestly, i think that this is dubbed a classic simply because it is older than sand. Gee, maybe if I just go out and slop a few words down on a piece of paper, it'll be a classic in 160 years! It'll be required of every high school sophomore, like this idiotic ""story."" Excuse me now, I'm off to begin my masterpiece. I'm sure it'll be better than this."
1,THE ONE STAR WAS TO GET YOUR ATTENTION,I Can't emphasize enough how great this book was. This is the first and only book that I have ever involuntarily read! I guarantee NO SLOW READING. The life of Jane Eyre will hook you from the beginning and you won't be able to put it down. There are not enough starts to rate this book.
1,Wrong Book,"Well, the book is in good condition BUT IT WAS THE WRONG BOOK. i asked for a certain edition and I got a different. Very upsetting."
3,Okay,"Jane Eyre sounded like a depressed person, and almost all of the people in this book didn't have much personality. Also, the writer discribed to much things."
1,Don't buy this version of the book!,"Don't get sucked in by the pretty cover and cheap price (like I did)! This is apparently a printed-on-demand book, and the print font is all but unreadable. I tried, but could hardly get through the first page because of the font. I will be returning this book as soon as I figure out how to do so. There are plenty of other versions of this classic to choose - they're probably all easier to read than this one."
4,true romance?,"This book is an old fashioned romance. Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time. After all, he sounds like a pretty intense and hot guy, so Jane can't be faulted for falling for him. In any case, this is one of those totally romantic and dramatic books. If you liek that kind of thing, you'll love Jane Eyre."
4,A review by a 15-year-old girl.,"Jane Eyre is a really good book. I really enjoyed reading this book. This book is about a girl who suffered a lot in her life. She was an orphan. Her parents died when she was small. Even though she suffered in her life, she overcame those difficulties. You should read this book and find out what happened to Jane in the end. I know that whoever reads this book will definitely enjoy it like I did.- Review by Johanna"
4,Jane Eyre,An old classic that I had largely forgotten. I enjoy the words that are no longer used and the chance with the kindle to look up definitions easily.
4,great book,Love it even more because it was free. You will not be disappointed. Wonderful read. Interesting. Insightful. Just loved it.
3,hasn't held up well for me,"I first read this in my early twenties and was blown away.Returning to it now in middle age and having the wisdom of years of relationships and miscellaneous sufferings coming between the two readings, I would say it's a lot less convincing and insightful.One of the many things that hampered enjoyment this time was believability problems. Like I'm so sure the loony wife could be living right down the hall with Jane not cluing in to this for months. Absolutely everybody would have known . . . this is not something you could have kept secret.And the whole thing with her saviors turning out to be distant relatives. Why didn't the younger me find this coincidence to be as cackhanded as I find it now? I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . ."
5,Poignant and Touching!,"Jane Eyre is a beautifully written masterpiece! Bronte uses eloquent language to convey a timeless love story. The book was moving and profound, and I thouroughly loved it. I suggest it to everyone. It is a book not to be missed."
4,Jane Eyre: An English Masterpiece,"Jane Eyre is a classic tale of a young girl abused by her aunt and sent away to become a governess. She meets a cynical, odd man named Edward Rochester. His ward, Adele is a delight and quite charming. Almost like a Bonnie Butler. At Thornfield (Rochester's home) secrets unfold and hurt is contagious. A true masterpiece of English literature written by a great author. A book that will not soon be forgotten."
5,Really great!,I'm in third grade and I do a lot of reading. I find this book amazing and well written. I can relate to Jane Eyre because when she was young in the book that's how I feel sometimes. Sad. But after reading this book I've been happier because theres hope.
5,Blossoming of a Plain Faced Female,"In the early 1800's of virgin England, an parentless young becomes employed as a governess at Thornfield Hall, a massive and rural estate owned by the quite yet remote Mr. Rochester. JANE EYRE is a love story created by the genius of Charlotte Bronte's imaginative mind. Above all, the story of a woman of passion and intelligence who refuses to be satisfied by her ""place"" in society, and asserts her identity & position with force, and candid dignity."
4,Girl's growth from trauma,"Though a classic novel, this is interesting.I like Jane's life. Though she is short, she is tough and has strong spirit. I have learned something to live from this novel and her.I want to recommend for students, especially girls under high school, to read this because all girls will grow while being strong, positive, and optimistic."
4,Charlotte Bronte Unsurpassed,"It's easy to see why this novel is regarded as one of the greatest of all time. If you love classic English literature, Charlotte Bronte is unsurpassed in her command of the language. She delves into the depths of feelings of her characters which must have been especially gripping to her audience in the mid-19th century and indeed today. Well read by Juliet Mills."
5,Fantastic,Compelling and thorough from beginning to end. Not a stage of the story is glossed over or treated minimally. All characters well developed. Gut-wrenching. Wanted to reread (relisten) the moment it finished.
4,Worthwhile challenge,"There's a reason classics like this and Jayne Austen continue to be bestsellers.... they are just great stories. The language issue is the biggest challenge for me, but I'm really glad I persevered. A must read for anyone who enjoys historic romance novels."
5,Jane knows,Re-reading this recently made me realise how extraordinary this novel really is. Bronte's portrayal of Jane is more than touching. The novel works both on an emotional and on a literary level. Glad to have redisovered it.
4,Jane Eyre Great Teen Reading,Jane Eyre is a novel that captures the reader. It is about a young girl who experiences the hardships of everyday life. Living as an orphan she is driven to become successful and fall in love. She becomes a young writer nd often expresses her feelings and thoughts through her writing. As a young teenager I can easily relate to a lot of how she feels. I felt comfort in reading this novel because I am not the only person going through a lot of changes in my life. I recommend this novel to a lot of young readers and especially young teenage girls. Jane Eyre contains a point of view that captivates the reading.
2,I love Jane Eyre but the Footnotes Ruined It,"Don't get me wrong, Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books. However, this version of Jane Eyre has millions of footnotes so you are forced to constantly flip back and forth to see if the footnotes are saying anything useful.When the character Adele is speaking paragraphs of French, they don't bother translating it for you but they will gleefully tell you what's going to happen one-hundred pages later in the book.Reading this version of Jane Eyre is like watching a movie with an over-enthusiatic friend who keeps talking through the whole movie and telling you what's going to happen. If you're going to read Jane Eyre, I would reccomend different version"
3,Abridged :(,"I will agree that this performance is given with sensitivity to the voice of Jane Eyre and of Charlotte Bronte, but alas it's an abridged version. The above listing does not give any indication of this, consequently I was very disappointed when it arrived. I personally have no use for abridged books. When I pick up a book (print or audio) I want to experience the entire book. Abridged books always leave me feeling cheated, wondering what did I miss?"
4,Really good!,I loved the movie but this gave so much more to the story than the movie and a deeper explanation of Rochester's character. I liked the prose better than Bronte's Villette even though I enjoyed that story as well. It was bit easier to read. Too much French in Villette.
5,Changed My Life,"I never thought myself the type to write a review for a book, but Jane Eyre presents itself as an exception. After reading the review below by a ""teenager"" I felt I, also being a teenager, must add a good word for this book, and for the teens out there who don't whine to their teachers when they try to share something great. I was 11 when I read Jane Eyre for a school book report of our choosing and was the first ""real"" book I ever read. It is the book that changed my gaze from the television screen to the written page. To this day, I prefer a book over a TV show any day, and I am 19. If it can do that for an 11 year old, I'm sure you will enjoy it too."
4,with audio +++,"So glad I chose to read this classic again. Wish there had been an audio option when I read it the first time...35+ yrs ago! CliffsNotes didn't do it, me, or my grade any justice."
5,GOOD READ!,This book probably would lose some of it's charm in today's movies. Emotion & thoughts are proclaimed! There's no guess work as to what's going on at any time in this book. It's a beautiful classic. I'm only sorry that I didn't read it sooner in life.
3,Repeats,"I decided to make this year the year of the classics. This was the first one I chose and to be honest, I was disappointed for there were a lot of sentences that were repeated and many of the names of the towns were missing. However, reading about the trials and triumphs of a young woman and having love win in the end, there is nothing better."
5,Jane Eyre,"It has been many years since I first read it. It is a bit old fashioned, which adds to its charm."
4,"Sure it's dated, but it's enjoyable if you let it be","I read this in order to compare it with JENNA STARBORN, and there's no doubt but that this is the true classic with its Gothic overtones and its portrayal of a strong and independent woman in times not supportive of such strength and independence in women.Many will have difficulty with this book, because it's rich in detail and rich in mood. Today's readers may need patience and understanding to enjoy this. If one relaxes and accepts the book as a portrait of the thinking of the era in which it was written, one can relate it with today's society.Basically, this is the story of a woman guided by her inner values. As such, it's not really a book for guys. On the other hand, it tells of a style of life far from that led by today's high school girls, and therefore takes careful reading.It's classic, and if accepted as a Gothic romance that reveals the thinking and attitudes of the time when written, it's a timeless story that speaks to all."
1,These Tapes Don't Work,Beware when you buy this tape. It employs a technology that is not easily usable. You need a balance dial on your tape player. None of my recently-bought players have this dial. Check your equipment before buying this item or you will find it to be junk.
1,Age does not a classic make- truly a boring book.,"I truly cannot understand why anyone would be awed by Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read. Unfortunately, this novel is required reading in certain parts of the nation. This bland, boring novel is not the way to spark reading with young adults."
1,It discourages people from reading for the rest of life!,"I was forced to read this book for summer reading. No ways around it. Upon reading the back page summary, I knew that it would be a grueling torture test in which only the strong willed would surive to the last page. Trudging page by terribe, agonizing page, I read the book over a period of one horrific month. Needless to say, this book ruined the previous exitement I had about reading. This is terrible. Some ""classics"" should not be given to males, as goes for females. Obviously a romance novel should not be given to a male and ask him to enjoy it, as such a brutal police killers book should not be given to a female and expect her to geniunely enjoy it. This book has left a deep scar on my ability to love liturature for the rest of my life and will not be easily healed."
1,"Boring, Boring ,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!",THERE IS REALLLY ACTUALLY TWO WORDS THAT I THINK SUMS UP Jane Eyre boring and senseless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Slow moving, feminist book.","I thought this was one of the slowest moving books I have ever read. Mainly focused on ""romance"" and unappearant drama. The ending to this book is also very predictable, I won't say it here because that will give it away. If this book had an unknown date and author I'd of thought it was another one of those trashy ""love"" novels written by Danielle Steel. Pure crap. The only reason I can find that this novel my even be remotely considered a classic is because it was written by a woman and it is Victorian."
3,"Long,Longer, & Longest",This book is truly a classic. I read it for my A.P English class over the summer. It's just very long. There are too many dead points in the novel. The novel jumps back and forth between different thoughts and actually speaking often. It has a lot of good symbolism in it however. I reccomend reading wide sargasso sea afterwards for it is a novel from Bertha's point of view!
2,A Visit With the Past,"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte was our book club selection for this month. It is a book I had not read since I was in high school. Now I can't believe that at one time I plowed my way though the extravagant prose, it must have been because the selection of other romance books was limited.Our edition was large print, for which I was thankful and as a recommendation I'd suggest a condensed version.Writing style have changed since 1848, but one item of interest. Early in the book Miss Bronte describe the characteristics of the development of a serial killer as graphically as any modern thriller.Nash Black whose titles are available in Amazon Kindale editions.HaintsSins of the FathersWriting as a Small Business"
3,i'm thirteen,"all the review's here say ""ooo u can't appreciate this as a teenager"". u know what??? i'm a YOUNG teen, and i can appreciate the romance in this story. the only thing is... idk it's heart wrenching in some parts but other parts its just... boring! i was forced to read this for a book report. whoever thinks we don't understand the romance then ur wrong because today's teenagers grow up quickly what w/ all the media and etc. we do understand. we might not take it as seriously but we do understand it. don't diss us and say this book is too difficult for us. my teacher would not have recommended this it us if she thought we were too ignorant to understand it."
1,couldn't even get through the preview sample,"ok, I haven't listened to this - the sound of the narrator taking a loud gasp of air at the end of reading each sentence was making my toes curl.And how can you mis-spell the title of the book?Perhaps it's great, or the sound gets better later, hard to say.All I know is that I could barely get through the preview."
2,"Maybe it's just me, but...","I found the beginning of this book interesting enough, but in my opinion it just went down from there. Unlike the other people who have reviewed this book, I believe that Jane Eyre could have been reduced to half its size. The plot was good, but it was a struggle to finally finish the book. I know, many who have read this might hate me, but I just found the it rather uninteresting. Or maybe I just can't appreciate good books, either one. I wouldn't recommend this."
3,Facts of Life,I enjoyed picking up Jane Eyre to pass the time while traveling. Charlotte was very detailed in her description of Jane's life. It is a slowly evolving saga which reminds me of the kinds of things that still go on in life today. It was good and am glad to be able to move on to another!
5,Excellent!,"I received this book for a gift when I was twelve and found it incredibly boring. I am now eighteen and for lack of any other books to read picked it up again. To my suprise I could not put it down! The character of Jane Eyre was both inspiring and identifiable. Charlotte Bronte's best novel no doubt, the plot was excellently well crafted. Although a few parts are obvious, this classic romantic novel kept me turning pages furiously!"
3,"Many people love this book, but it is simply not for me","This book is a classic, loved by many, and may be just the book for you. But for me, i found it rather dull, and while i like fiction, historical fiction, i found this to drag on."
3,I was not particularly pleased.,"Though I did enjoy Jane Eyre, I found that the author, in my opinion, sometimes took an extremely long time to get through something. At one point, the author actually says 'I need but a few lines to expain the next 5 years of my life' or something to the effect of that, and she take at least 3 pages doing it. I don't have the largest attention span, and sometimes Jane Eyre just took too long for me to keep going."
4,Jane Eyre,"It good to read a old classic novel like Jane Eyre, and wonder what it would like to live back then."
4,Jane Eyre,"Hard to get into (óld fashioned writing style'), but once you do, a throroughly engrossing read. Reading classics such as this is illuminating, and almost literally takes you to another world. Enjoy"
5,A perfect book for any romantic soul....,"This book, is without a doubt, simply wonderful. At every turn of the page, you will be fully enveloped into the life of Jane Eyre, a magical yet ordinary girl whose courage and creative spirit will inspire even the most realistic of hearts. Her life and times, told with brilliant eloquence by Charlotte Bronte, will captivate the heart and mind and the end will have you cheering and crying by turns. True love, deception, greed, and bravery are but a few of the themes of this great novel. I can recommend it to anyone competely without reservation! A must-read! Perfect for cold, rainy afternoons with a blanket wrapped around you, you will not, I repeat, will not want to put this book down"
3,Simply not my style,"Prior to tackling this work, I had only read one romance novel that I have every liked - Gone with the Wind. Reading Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre"" did not change that statistic. While I can acknowledge the worth and eloquence of this novel, I cannot say that I enjoyed it in the least. It took a determined effort for me to read it through, and I was quite relieved to reach the end.From my experience, I have yet to meet any male who has enjoyed this book, and have yet to meet a female that didn't adore it. I don't know what it is about the books by the Bronte sisters and Austen, but for some reason, the gender gap seems a mile wide.For what it is, I am sure it is a great book worthy of the praise it has received."
5,"Strength, character, and duty....","A novel that stands the test of time. Jane Eyre is an eloquently written, surprising, and captivating novel. The beauty of this tale is sometimes overlooked because of the time period from which it hails. However, one must not allow the restrains of the time period in which this novel was written restrict one from reading it. For, not only does Jane defy the roles set for her by the society of her time, but this novel, written under a pseudonym by Charlotte Bronte defies the rules of a novel for its time.The novel is revolutionary in its own singularly, and by what is captured on its pages.This is a must-read for anyone. A classic that is a necessary addition to every library.This book is above any star-rating system."
5,I love this book! Definitely a keeper.,"This is what I call a wonderful novel. I loved the character of Jane, her independance and sense of self. I really like this time period. I had read this book a couple times as a teenager and have just re-read it at 40+ years. It is a timeless book. The only critique I have is that in this edition, Jane's name is spelled as Janet, especially towards the end of the book. This misprint occurred a number of times and was distracting. Otherwise, the book is one I will re-read over and over."
5,A most incredible acheivement!,"I had often heard of this book, but wondered why it was so popular. Now I know. I have read this book many times. The story is tantalizing and wonderful. It truly is a classic. You will not regret reading this book. The character Jane has something in her that all women can relate to. And the mystery of Thornfield and of Mr. Rochester will keep you turning each of the pages until you are completely immersed in the story. A must read for all generations."
3,Had to do it.,Have always wanted to know what this was about. It is written differently so it takes a while to get into it. Its a classic. I liked it.
4,Different read,It was an unexpected book. Strange. I rather liked it for its love story. It is hard to describe. A good book worth a read.
5,"'Aye, St John is like his kirstened name'","My copy refers to the 1997 edition of Jane Eyre, Penguin Classics. A landmark on the road to my understanding of female authors. Clean type, wide margins easily read, they chose to make the book slightly wider than thicker so it is comfy to hold.Entering the world of the immortal emotion in a setting long past, not being a scholar, does pose problems.Penguin provides valuable auxilliary notes explaining the context quite well.For instance,I had not known that Thackery was struggling with publishing then and that C.B. was taking solace and courage from his battles.Do other publishings of the classics:Norton,Dover, Bantam, etc. relate to the public as well?I whish my fellow customers or Amazon in its info blurb were more sensitive to how the book they review is made,and how the text is supported."
5,Great piece of literature!,"This book is definetly a great piece of literature! It's one of the best books I've ever read. This has much depth and meaning to it, and has many underlying meanings. The book is beautifully and lushly written. The multi-faceted characters give this book much depth. Strong-willed Jane, Enigmatic Rochester, Kind Fairfax, gleeful Adele, Terrifying Bertha Mason, Stoic St. John, among other characters give this book a variety of characters and all are unforgettable characters. Love and Passion, Hate and disdain, desire and greed, deception and mystery, etc. abound in this book. Bronte is a genius, and it shows in this book!"
5,Exciting and enjoyable,"I read this book a couple of months ago and really enjoyed it. It is about a girl who is adopted by her evil aunt and is sent away to boarding school, there she becomes a teacher. Later she becomes a governess and falls in love with her employer. I won't say what happens next- it will spoil the suprise. all I can say is I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although in some places I found the language difficult to understand. Don't let me put you off."
2,The most overrated book of all time,"I've never understood why everyone lavishes so much praise on this book. It is the most overrated book ever.One of the most fundamental things a book has to do is hold the reader's interest, and in this aspect, Jane Eyre fails. To be fair, it is utterly gripping throughout the first ten chapters. After that, the quality of the book falls off sharply. The rapid pace becomes boring repition of having to go through thirty pages of nothing to get to a page or two where something actually happens, then another 30 pages of nothing.It's kind of a shame really, for a book that started out as well as this one to crash and burn the way it does. But it happens, and what we are left with is a dreadfully boring book that continues to have praise heaped on it for reasons I will probably never fathom."
3,Maybe I'm just too opiniated,"While Jane Eyre is supposed to be one of the greatest novels of all time I can't say that I liked it nor disliked it. I don't think that I liked the character of Jane very much. I understand that she was mistreated and that she also lived in the 1700's but I still think that she was rude. She had no confidence and no pride. She would not let people love her and treat her nicely. When Mr. Rochester asks her to marry him and then wanted to take her out and buy her a nice dress and jewlery, she acts so coldly towards him that it makes me sick. Maybe I didn't like her character because I have self confidence and am very opiniated. Neverthless, I still believe that Charlotte Bronte is an excellent author, I don't love or hate many characters, but I hated Jane Eyre."
2,Maybe I'm too young to 'get it.' All I know is I hated it.,"If you sent JANE EYRE to a publisher today, the response would be, in fancy wording, ""Um, sorry, this is too long and too weird. Boring. Sorry, please try again."" I'm 13, so perhaps I'm too young to grasp it, but I enjoyed other books which are supposed to be similar, such as Pride and Prejudice.In the 13-year-old vernacular, here's what was going through my mind:Ew! Why the heck would she marry that weird, bad-tempered, hairy scary man? If I found out that my fiance had kept his insane first wife in the attic and not told me, I'd file for divorce! He's bossy, unreasonable and mean. Why'd he pretend to wanna marry Miss Ingram? I guess the scandalousness of a governess falling in love with her employer is supposed to keep you interested, but really, it's dead boring. It's an okay story, but written so dully that it's ruined. Why wasn't Jane suspicous?"
2,"True love is blind *well, it is for Jane, anyway*","Bronte shows through Jane that sex is Not one of woman'snecessities. Rochester is ugly, but he has a mind. I wish all womenwere of this opinion."
2,Zzzzzz....,"I suppose it was an ok book... It probably had a good moral and all that stuff, but there was about 150 pages of excess crap that I, personally, didn't care about! It was just a teeny bit to long.....!"
1,Story Great-Edition poor,This review has to do with this edition for Kindle. There is no table of contents and no search ability. You cannot jump by chapter using the usual button either.
3,Jane Eyre... The ugly duckling :(,"There isn't much to say about this book. Other that I had a group assignment a few months ago to read this, and then present it to our fellow peers. Lets see, how can I put this into words? Well, it was pretty self torturing. Page after page was about fifty billion paragraphs of Charlotte Bronte describing a landscape or the ""confusing"" emotions that Miss. Eyre was having towards her boss. Although, it must have been tough writing a book which displays a woman of independence and such, Ms. Bronte is a decent writer... the book would have just been more enjoyable if there was splashes of complete randomness.As for myself, I really do not plan on reading this book, ever again. Unless some Iraqi solider is torturing me with an ablazed iron rod and screaming at me to tell him about the great collections of Charlotte Bronte and her infamous book, ""Jane Eyre""."
1,"I LOVE classic romance, but not this!","I enjoy classic Victorian era romance , and this by far is the worst book I have ever read. I know that Jane's character was suppose to be ""Plain Jane"", but I in no way found her endearing. Instead of feeling sorry for all her misfortunes and lack of love, I found myself detesting her character. The plot drags on forever, when really it could be told better in five minutes. It could be romantic, except that the plot is so boring and outlandish, that it overshadows that element. And the supernatural elements of the novel literally made me laugh out loud. I could go on about why I hate this novel, but I don't want to ruin the story for others."
1,Watching tomatoes rot is more interesting than Jane Eyre.,"While sloshing through the almost unreadable text of the verbose Charlotte Bronte, one can imagine why she was never married. Don't get us wrong, it's not that we don't understand the underlying themes and the higher level concepts; they just contain absolutely no relevance whatsoever. The plot, dare we call it that, winds slowly through the 400+ pages of this so-called classic. If you must read it for school-don't. You'd be better off guessing on the test than being utterly confused and bored to tears."
5,Jane Eyre on Kindle,"A cherished classic. It is said thatwhen women are in distress,theyturn to Jane Austen. The same can besaid of Charlotte Bronte."
4,Jane Eyre A classic Novel,"Jane Eyre by CharlotteThis book is about an orphan named Jane Eyre, who gets sent to an all girl Christian school by her evil aunt,Ms.Reed.After she leaves the school,Jane goes to work for Mr. Rochester as a governess.While working there,Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester,but many obstacles keep them apart till the end.I thought this book was brillantly done.It deals with many emotions and reaches your heart.I would reccomend this book to anyone who is able to read."
1,NO -476 STARS,"O MY WORD COULD A BOOK BE ANY MORE BOOOORING? I MEAN COME ON! HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT ALL THOSE FRENCH WORDS MEAN? THE BOOK IS SO HORRIBLE AND IF YOU LIKE IT, THEN FINE, BUT I'M STATING MY OPINION! AND I HATE DESTINY'S CHILD!"
1,"Mildless drivel with sickening, neverending irony.","Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match. Mrs. DeFarge also being Little Girl with Bad Past is nothing compared to this. Honestly, what are the chances of stuff like this REALLY happening? The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick. Now, if it just so happened that Mr. Rochester was Jane's father, and his wife was her sister...Now that might have sparked a little more interest."
1,This book is long and boring,Jane Erye is a girl who is adopted by a wealthy and mean step-mother. Soon after the book begins she is sent to a boarding school where most of the teachrs and head masters are mean and she isn't taken care of very well. Once she graduates she is hired as a tutor to a wealthy land owner with much to hide. This book reminds of many other stories I have read. The only difference is Jane Erye is much longer and much more boring.
1,The book never came,"The book never came, after some email exchange with the seller, no conclusion, I filed a claim with Amazon and got the money back."
5,Classic,"Found this to be a descriptive and moving tale of love, hardship, faith, and perseverance. Better than the movie. Enjoyable"
5,What took me so long?,I wish modern writers had the artistry imagination and poetry that seems to come so easily to Bronte and for that matter any other book many shudder at in reflection of high school English class. Beautiful as it is simple. I have no complaints.
4,A great classic,I know that I read this book many years ago in English classes but I am enjoying it so much more - still haven't finished and am looking forward to the next chapter.
4,great classic love story,I enjoyed this book. It is entertaining and at times very suspenseful. Just an all around good classic love story.
3,Mislabeled,"It was labeled as UNABRIDGED on the website when I ordered the audiobook. I got a refund, and the seller (the_book_depository_, who was very responsive) let me keep the copy. I didn't open the package since I'm going to give it to the town library.Soon afterwards, I bought an unabridged one: Jane Eyre (The Classic Collection) by Charlotte Bronte and Susan Ericksen (MP3 CD - May 25, 2005) - Audiobook, ISBN-10: 1596009411, 20+ hours. I enjoy this version very much."
4,Reading with Tequila,"Jane Eyre was long, wordy and old. It was a recipe for instant dislike. While I didn't love the book, I certainly enjoyed it. The character of Jane Eyre was upstanding and brave. She showcased many qualities women strive for and find hard to reach even today. Mr. Rochester was both off-putting and strangely likable at times. The mixture of drama, romance and a bit of mystery was engaging. While I often put the book down, I never once thought of not finishing it. A deserved classic."
4,Yay Jane,"I've watched the movie(s) over and over but have never read the book until now.I knew what was going to happen, and still I couldn't put it down.I will be reading it again."
2,Disliking a classic novel,"Ladies and gentlemen, readers of all ages, I express my sheer condolences if I offend anyone from what I am about to write: The novel Jane Eyre, I thought, was boring to the extent that I would often drift asleep while reading it. Although I am not use to a story that does not go straight to the conflict, I believe this story was on going. There is some excellent imagery, and metaphorical aspects in the story, but only that can not save this narrative. If you are a person that loves a romantic setting with certain twists every now and then, this is the book for you."
2,Not a book for the average male!,"While there are wonderful characters and a somewhat clever plot, this book gets very boring! The main thrill of the novel is just a written account of most girls' dream of becoming the wife of a man to whom they are truly in love (OK, so Jane had some hardships along the way too...;-)). Of course, Jane is very independent and has no exceptionally good looks, so the story may be considered an inspiration to the female culture's wish of being respected for what is inside...? I found it an inspiration to go to bed a little sooner."
3,Bad edition of a great novel,"Jane Eyre is by far one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is interesting and is written in a beautiful fashion. However, if you plan on buying it, don't get the Penguin Classics edition. Towards the middle of the novel, there are strange spelling mistakes: half of Jane's name becomes Janet, which is not even a character in the book. It gets very annoying after a while and doesn't occur any of the other editions. I definitely recommend this book, but just not this edition."
3,Jane Eyre,"While I enjoyed this book, I was disappointed. I found it to be verbose, going on and on for long passages where nothing much changed or happened - just repetitious. In addition, it is profoundly and deeply Christian, to the point of preachiness. This last may not be a problem for you if you happen to share the author's views.However, if you can live with its faults, it is otherwise well written. Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester are well drawn characters, interesting and unexpected. The plot has sufficient twists and turns to hold your interest. And the ending is satisfying, a big plus for me.In summary, it is more dated than, say, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (a personal favorite), but it is still worth reading.(This review is of the unabridged audio version of the book.)"
3,The Best Book from the Bronte Family,"This is surely the best book from the Bronte family. Out of any of the books that they have published, this one is by far the closest to being interesting. A lot of neat stuff happens if you pay close attention.The reason why I give this book a three is that I don't see it a as a great work of literature. The are many other books out there (my favorite: the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo) that deserve a five. I couldn't bring myself to even give this a four.In all I see Jane Eyre as an ok book. However, it does become very dull at times and you won't pick it up and read it again if you make it to the end."
4,Captivating!,I have had reading this book on my to do list for years and I really enjoyed reading it. It never ceases to amaze how great the classics are.
4,Struggle for Freedom,"Jane Eyre is a romantic novel. It portrays life for the women in the early 1800's. Jane is trying to to become independant, but yet at the same time she is trying to find love. Rocheter tries to control her. Jane once said to him, ""I can't stay here to become nothing to you? This quote shows that Jane is trying to make something of herself. She isn't going to let a man control her. When you read this novel you will find that Jane is a very determined women. While she is trying to find herself, she also finds love in her life."
3,A story about a hard life,"A story about a hard life We think that Jane lives a hard life, but we were so happy as we saw that it had a happy ending. It is a beautiful love story and sometimes it is romantic. It is not only a love story it is a thrilling story too. As an orphan she had a very hard beginning in her life. As a reader you must feel with Jane. If Jane is angry with a person you feel angry too. So it is a emotional story. Sometimes the author stays too long with a particular situation. Angela & Dorothee"
3,a difficult read,"We recommend the book only to people who speak English verywell (so, we not!). Jane is a person with a strong character and aninteresting but really hard life. At the end of the story she finds her fortune."
3,It was good,I thought that this book was sometimes interesting but the romance parts i loved. At the end when he became blind i cried and it was so romantic that they got married i wish she would have written more books like this.
5,A TRUE PAGE TURNING CLASSIC,"Humbled Jane Eyre(pronounced air) is turned out of her aunt's house after being accused of throwing a gobblet at her master's 16yr old son, then sent to a boarding school for girls. There, Jane remains quiet and shy, though slowing becomes cultured in society and learns to become a governess. She places an add in the daily paper to become a hired governess, and surprisingly recieves a response to watch over a little French girl. When Jane arrives, the master, as usual is gone. The first time she meets him is by a mere accident of his horse being tired. Mr. Rochester invites friends to stay over, including a beautiful and money-searching woman, who appears to catch Rochester's eyes. While this is happening, Jane falls in love with rochester. WHen they reveal their true feelings and plan to marry, at the alter the are refused to become married because of a mad and insane wife Rochester has hidden in one of his cottages."
3,"Liked it, but didn't love it.","I was at first really absorbed in reading the parts that had to do with Jane's childhood. I did not miss a word of it. However, I found the parts after she became a governess a bit boring. I had a hard time with her falling head over heels with Mr. Rochester. He is too cold and self absorbed. Not the chivalrous hero of most fairy tales. His personality doesnt change one iota despite all of the things he has been through. I never ever see a resolve where he loves and accepts Adele. I thought that his indifference toward Adele was one of the things that TURNED JANE OFF about him!! Then she goes weak in the knees over him. I just found that really hard to digest. Yes, I know it's just a fiction, but the inconsistency of the woman who *seemed* to be consistent in her character threw me off."
3,Liked it a little but didn't love it,"When I first picked a book for a school assignment. I had to read it. But when I got further into the book, it turned out to be an ok book to read. I didn't understand Jane's part very well. Why did she fall in love with an realy old man? You will have to read the book to figure this out."
4,Almost Perfect Gothic Novel,"Like I said in the title this is an almost perfect gothic novel. I don't know French (I understand German)and there are parts where French is spoken. This book is well written and the characters are colorful. Jane is a passionate character. She is also quiet, meek (in her own way), but has strong opinions in the book. Mr. Rochester is dark, miserable, and extremly moody. I disliked Adele because she is way too irritating and spoiled. Miss Ingram is just as spoiled as Adele, intolerant, shallow, and insensitive. I don't really understand why Jane did not really investigate the strange laughter and Grace Poole. Well, she did but it was a very light interogation. She took Mrs. Fairfax's word for everything. Some of the things she said would be worth checking out. It gives more mystery to the book."
4,Jane Eyre - the best!,"First I've read this amazing story. My favorite forever. I know I will read it, share it, and quote it evermore."
1,DONT BUY THIS,Horrible DVD. Astoundingly bad quality. The full frame isn't even on the screen - the right-hand side is cut off.
2,Raintree county,I sent another review for this product earlyer saying the the quality was not very good and that it jumps at least three times thoughout the film. I asked at that time if there was a way to get this replaced.. I love this movie and it has taken me a long time to find it. Please let me know if it can be replaced. thank you Anita hedden
4,You must read the English subtitles!,"While this is not the greatest Montgomery Clift film, the English subtitles in this edition make this DVD fantastically entertaining. They range from slightly inaccurate to side-splittingly funny, and make this a must-have."
3,way want to wait till real blu ray if you a fan....,well for the money you get what you pay for....dont see this on tv..like most flicks......yes its a bit like vhs......all other copys are more money...so start over sentence here!
3,ross lockridge never knew what they did to his book,"Esquire magazine used to have a feature called ""Wretched Excess"" and I believe ""Raintree County"" would easily fall into that category.As for the one reviewer stating that Ross Lockridge probably didn't like the screenplay, well---unfortunately he never knew about the screenplay as he killed himself shortly after the book became a best selling novel in 1948 and the film was released in 1957."
4,NOT THAT BAD!,"Often considered the GONE WITH THE WIND of the poor,this civil war story has it's moments ,but is really uneven.SUSANNAGH (LIZ'S character)is overblown and it slows the action a bit.CLIFT has the kind of stubborn role he often had in his career;EVA MARIE SAINT and LEE MARVIN in a supporting role are convincing.While not a must see movie,it is a real curiosity that won't waist your precious time.You better see this one on your nearest video location store.Don't make the mistake of buying it"
3,TAYLOR`S FIRST OSCAR NOMINATED ROLE,"RAINTREE COUNTY was MGM`s try 2 outdo themselves(they made GONE WITH THE WIND with Selznick, remember). It was an unqualified failure. Taylor won her first Oscar nomination(Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and Suddenly Last Summer next, until she won for Butterfield 8 1960) and Clift suffered injuries both physically and mentally after a party with Taylor and Mike Todd - driving his car drunk. He is walking through his part, his energies clearly gone because of the accident. Taylor lovely but overplayes in keyscenes. She i s breathtaking, but lacking the temperament of the very best -VIVIEN LEIGH and her Scarlett."
1,Raintree County DVD,"I've been searching for this movie for a long time. The story is very good, but the quality of the DVD was not. It consisted of 2 discs, and midway through the first one, the disc started sticking. We tried everything we could to make it play, but we were unsuccessful. Disc two worked fine, but if I had know it wasn't an American DVD, I would not have ordered it. I was glad it had subtitles, but the words are garbled. All in all, I was very disappointed with the product."
1,'Raintree County' DVD,"I always loved this film, but am totally disappointed in this DVD...awful in every way !Color bad, sound bad, picture quality bad, and whatever I haven't mentioned...ALL BAD !"
1,horrifying,"The image and sound quality of this DVD is horrifyingly and insultingly terrible. By FAR the worst of any DVD I have ever purchased. The image quality it poor and frequently blurry, the audio soundtrack is frequently out of sync with the picture, and it is obvious that the screen dimensions have been altered. I feel duped and honestly could not be more upset with this edition. While certainly not a classic like Gone With the Wind, Raintree County is an interesting and historically significant film and it deserves a better DVD edition than this garbage! Save your money and stay far away from this disc."
1,So Disappointed,I got so excited when I saw this and ordered - not understanding that it is dubbed in english - so now I am stuck with it
3,GOT A HARD FO FIND ITEM.,I WAS EXCITED TO FIND THE MOVIE I COULD NOT FIND ANYWHERE. IT WAS NOT IN GOOD PLAYING CONDITION. IT DID NOT START AT THE BEGINNING. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT RECOURSE TO TAKE TO HAVE THIS CORRECTED.
2,Good movie/bad DVD,I bought this DVD last year after having seen this movie many years ago on TV. I'm a big fan of Monty Clift and Liz Taylor and always loved this movie. But...this is an awful DVD copy. Looks like it was copied off of TV. I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews here on Amazon. Maybe someday a decent version of this will be released. It's definetly not this one.
1,I was ripped off,"This DVD was of the poorest quality I have ever seen. It came in two disc, one in an Asian language and the other in English. It is a shame what was done two this classic film. I could not watch it for more than a half hour if that long because of the bluriness and poor color quality. I don't know where the seller got this piece of junk from. I will be mindful never to purchase from this seller again."
1,Does not PLAY!,This is a cheap copy of a pretty good movie. I should have noticed the Chinese writting on the front of the movie cover. Attempted to play on several DVD players...did not work. Will be returning soon!
5,A great testimonial on elitist policies !,"Fromkin from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and an expert on conflicts has written a marvelous book that thoroughly delineated the policies of the dominant powers in the early 1900s, which led to the creation of the modern Middle East.Fromkin discusses how the seeds of conflict were created by the colonial powers, in order to ensure their continuous dominance over the Middle East and its natural resources.This book subtly addresses the politics of discord creation, and the importance of well designed conflicts in attaining the desired results.Peace to end all peace is a great reading for the history buff who is interested in an elitist perspective."
5,A Piece to End All Piece: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East,"This is the essential and mandatory reading for anyone interested in understanding the political, social, economical, and ethnographic problems of the Middle East. A creation of the post WW1 powers that thoroughly ignored the conditions of this critical area, it could only be expected that the current explosive situation will ensue. The chapter on Iraq is illuminating."
4,Very Informative.,"I really enjoyed this book. Very well researched, and in my opinion well written. I read it two times, because there was so much to take in. Good read."
4,Lessons Learned on Events from Past that Apply to Current Ops of US Foreign Policy,"My unit read this book for professional development. I found it slow a firs, because it is a long read, but the chapters were interesting. I'm just a slow reader. The book offers countless lessons learned from the past that apply directly and indirectly to current US foreign policy in Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyone interested in learning from past events of the Great Game and large wars should read this book. One will learn a tremendous amount of background information about the Middle East: why it is the way it is today, why the region is geographically divided as it is, and other useful information. Whether the interested reader plans to visit the region for business or personal reasons or he plans to study for various reasons, this book will be valuable. I also recommend for group reading and discussion."
4,Wandering in the desert,I had this book around for quite a while before I got around to reading it. When I did I was pleased that it did endeavor to address all the issues surrounding the creation of the modern middle east... but to get there it seems to wander quite a bit at times.A great book nevertheless. Just plan on spending quite a bit of time with it.
5,A book to end all books,"Ever wonder about the Armenian genocide by Turkey, or what Winston Churchill did in WWI and after? Or what the Balfour Declaration was, and why it was made? Ever wonder about how Iraq, Jordan and Palestine got formed? These and countless other questions are answered about Middle Eastern history in this masterpiece of writing and history by Prof. David Fromkin. It's a long book, but surely one of the best I have ever read."
3,A bit off mark,"The book is off mark from it's stated intent, the author wanted to center the book around Winston Churchill, but ended up doing it around Mark Sykes, and therein lies it's problem. Very much of an English account of the history, although exposing the emptiness of the policies and thought behind them from political as well as military men of the empire, the book fails to tell a complete story. Still a readable book, though one will have to read other sources."
2,Disappointing treatment of an important topic,"The post-war disposition of the Ottoman empire lands in the Middle East still affects us today. This book provides a broad overview of the diplomatic and bureaucratic struggles that produced the settlement, from the British point of view. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, poorly edited, oddly footnoted, and generally disappointing. It almost appears to have been written in bits and pieces that were later stitched together, with little effort made to eliminate redundancy or streamline the writing. A more rigorous editing would have shortened it considerably with no loss of impact. However, the breadth of its coverage, and the importance of the topic, may make it a useful starting point for those interested in this area."
4,"A good, solid book","A Peace to End All Peace is enthralling in its reading and fascinating in scope, but a little bit of reflection after reading it brings to light some flaws. First, the history is somewhat lacking. I came to reading with a good deal of knowledge about it already, but someone without that prior knowledge might be lost. This is to some degree a reflection of Fromkin's scope, 7 or so years over a wide geographic area. Second, this book just wasn't satisfying. I can't really explain it, but I left this book feeling like I needed to know more, that reading those 600 pages had told an incomplete story. Nevertheless, I would rate A Peace to End All Peace to be a good and solid, if unspectacular, book."
4,A must read,"Prof. David Fromkin's ""A Peace To End All Peace"" is one of the best narratives of the First World War and ensuing creation of the modern Middle East. Although his views are pro-Entente in general and pro-British in particular, he manages to remain loyal to the historical facts and realities.His devotion of many pages to the leading war time British political elit comprises Lyod George, Churchill and Mark Sykes, have made his book over-volumous. (635 pages). Still it remains highly informative and riveting.A must read to understand politics and events of the period of 1914 to 1922."
3,Okay polka,Jimmy Sturr is a good entertainer and some of the songs fun. I prefer Frankie Yankoivic for a more traditional sound.
3,"its, ok","Well first off the little instructions that came with the foot are LACKING, and than the foot its self was kind of dissapointing, it doesnt put much tension on the elastic so you still need to put gentle tension on the elastic. I have decided to make a casing for elastic instead of using the foot whenever possible but its better than a zig zag."
1,Tension dial does not hold elastic,"This foot does a fair job of aligning tape or elastic with the edge of the fabric being sewn/serged. The dial on the foot does nothing - it does not put any tension on the elastic. Neither does the foot enable ""gathering of knit fabric"" per the instructions. If there are additional instructions necessary (perhaps change the differential feed?) they are not included in the instructions, which are vague. I returned this foot after several hours of trying to attach elastic."
2,Caution,"This is NOT a 'how to' book on Gunsmithing, if that is what you are looking for. It is an academic history of the gunsmith's trade in the United States over the last 400 years. It is a book for other academics and those interested in the history of gunsmithing in the US. The price is rather steep for anyone not a researcher, such as those more casually interested in gun histroy.For those with the interest, it is a well documented and annotated piece of work."
4,Just perfect book with bad CD.,"Contents of book - splendid, but installation program - repugnant. So, read THIS book and install ANOTHER Slackware package and all be all right."
2,"Nice try, but...","This book is a sincere attempt to deal with the incredible mess of LINUX networking. It's better than nothing. It has a lot of useful information. It also has a lot of typos and misstatements and turgid descents into pure confusion. It needs summary sections covering ""all the things required to..."" and a serious troubleshooting guide."
5,"Good content, but many annoying errors","Overall, The Linux Network includes some good information on setting up networking in general on Linux/Unix machines. However, the spelling mistakes and other errors are really annoying at times. If the mistakes were only small ones, I wouldn't be so picky, but there were errors like sonfusing ""DSP"" for ""DNS"" and mixing up the name of a newly created kernel. Also, the author spends too much time noting that a certain topic is ""beyond the scope of this book"". Although it is impossible to cover everything, it would make sense to just go on to the next topic. Finally, he spends more time introducing/ending the next chapter/section than actually writing the chapter. But, I'll recommend this book to anyone interested in Linux networking, as long as he doesn't mind the errors and somewhat flawed organization of the book."
4,good value!,"I bought this toy for my 13months old. Was bit too early for him and kind of dangerous for he likes to throw things. This puzzle is so durable, but quite dangerous when it's thrown!! Overall good quality.My 2 1/2 y/o, however absolutely loves this puzzle, although too easy for him. I'm sure our youngest child (13months old) will enjoy this toy in the future."
1,Completely disappointed,"We were so happy to have received this as a gift for our daughter. However, there is not one piece that correctly goes into place. The circle, which you would assume would be the easiest piece to place (since there are no edges) is the hardest to place, because of the notch that was made to cut out the circle. The remaining pieces (excluding the oval and rectangle) should fit in any direction, however they are only cut to fit one way. For instance, the square (4 right angles) should fit in any direction, but it only fits one way. We are highly disappointed in this company."
3,needs tweaking...,"While this puzzle is educational and my 1 year old daughter loves to play with it, it is NOT solid wood as the manufacturer claims. It is made with particle board. It came full of saw dust, too. The pictures are like stickers and I can already see them peeling off after 1 week bc my daughter puts the pieces in her mouth. What 1 year old doesn't? If it was actually ALL solid wood and painted with non-toxic paint, it would be better and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars then."
2,Good in theory,"My 13 month old son loves this, but I unfortunately have to echo the comments that it's poorly made. The saw dust went away after a bit, and I can live with the fact that the pieces can sometimes be difficult to put in, but the biggest problem is that my son is chewing the paper off the top of the pieces. It's kind of shocking actually, that they would manufacture a product that could be chewed away so easily when the product is geared toward children that are likely to put things in their mouths! I'll probably end up throwing it out shortly, but I'm hoping to find a replacement from a different company before I do. Bottom line is that I would never buy this again or gift it to anyone I cared about."
5,Perfect for little hands,"Great wood puzzle with large knobs for easy pick up. Learning colors & shapes is easy with this one. I gave as a gift for a one year old. She picks them up easily, and with a little help, places them back in their spot. I highly recommend this puzzle."
5,Great puzzle for any toddler,"My one year old boy just got this toy as a present and loves it. He actually bypasses his other puzzles for this one each time. Since he is only one - I am using the puzzle to teach him colors. When he is older, I can use it to teach him shapes. Really happy with this toy."
4,jumbo puzzle / shapes,I bought this as a gift for my 10 month old granddaughter. The large wooden pieces will be durable and the large knobs will fit in her hands perfectly.
2,Melissa & Doug Large Shapes Jumbo Puzzle,Not great. You can put red hexagon in to blue circle hole. It can confused player.
1,Disappointed,"In general I really love Melissa and Doug products. We have so many and have really enjoyed the quality, the clever designs, the learning opportunities and the non-toxic coatings. I could not speak more highly about them. And when faced with a decision to purchase a competitor, there is no contest. Until now.I am really disappointed with the Jumbo Knob Puzzle Geometric Shapes. Our daughter is repeatedly frustrated with this puzzle because although the shapes are typically symmetrical, these puzzle pieces/spots are not. As a result she second guesses her correct choices, gets frustrated, unhappy and confused. This puzzle is poorly designed. The spots for each shape should have been symmetrical, just as each of these shapes actually are in real life. I agree with the other posts, a circle should never be ""upside down"".Unfortunately, this puzzle is going into the trash, instead of being used and enjoyed like it ought to be. I would not recommend this to anyone."
5,What Makes Me Me,"I love this book!! It has great illustrations, lots of fun trivia and facts, very kids friendly!"
4,"Great tool, but perhaps a little to great.","I picked out this tool because it had a the most knobs of any other tool that I found. I think it works great. Admittedly I don't use all the knobs but it gives me all the options I need for my own issues. The only problem I have with it is all the knobs have a crease down the middle of them, which can be a little uncomfortable if you press down hard on bare skin. This seems like an obvious thing the manufacture should have addressed. I took a file and smoothed all the heads down and it's much more comfortable. This tool works great for me but admittedly a cheaper tool with less knobs would probably do just as well."
5,Wowweee this thing is Great!,This thing works on trigger points I didn't even know I had! My right buttocks was bothering me and thought it might be sciatica. I started first in the buttock area then pressing near my hip and it felt really tender and my lower back popped! Don't know what happened all I know my buttock pain is relieved. This device comes with a nice info pamphlet. It is the perfect tool for self treatment. I have bought other devices similar to this in the past but this is the best!
3,good for those who know how to use it,I'm unclear how helpful it is. But it at least provides the psychological satisfaction of reaching points on your back that otherwise cannot be reached.
2,average product,This product does not come with a manual or explaintion on how to use the different knobs. It is difficult to understand how to use all the nodes to get relief. So far the product has caused me more pain than relief.
1,No improvement,"I have a lot of muscle knots in my back, and this has done very little to alleviate them. I was originally going to rate this 3/5 because I seem to be a one off, but frankly its not doing what it claims to do."
2,Not for me,"This product is bulky and obscure. Not very useful and easy to use. I bought it, tried it and it's been sitting in the closet ever since. I would not recommend this product."
3,Instructions are terrible,Overall I just don't know how to use this thing. The instructions are not that great. It's awkward to hold and use.
5,had my doubts,"I sit in a vehicle at work for most of a ten hour shift. Staring at a computer and typing away in a swiveled, contoured position makes my neck ache. It is constructed very solidly and I use it as recommended for 10-30 seconds (3-4 sets in each spot) when I feel the tense aching coming on and it relieves it. It gives you nice access to really anywhere on your body and it extremely useful for me. I also lift weights and work out five days a week and never realized after using this, just how tender and tight my rhomboids and other surrounding back(shoulder) muscles get. Very happy with the purchase."
5,Great,"Awesome product! I never knew I would enjoy this so much! i had it shipped to work, and everyone was curious. I let them try it, and now everyone wants one. I love it and I recommend to everyone."
3,Not that impressed,"I had high hopes that the back buddy would allow me to reduce the visits I made to receive deep tissue massage for my chronically tense neck and upper back muscles. Although the back buddy is well made and does provide pressure at trigger points, I haven't found it as effective as either rolling around the floor with a tennis ball under my back, or using a foam roller (very fun and effective). Probably would not have purchased it had I known this in advance. I gave it three stars though b/c it does what it claims (provides pressure on trigger points) and is well made."
4,good self massager,This is something you can use without the help of another and it is effective too. The knobs are nice for digging into those tight shoulder muscles.
4,"great product, poor service","This item was supposed to include a manual which was not shipped and the company made no mention of missing manual. Contacted them asking for the manual. Turns out they ran out of manuals and offered $6 back for missing manual. I didn't like the fact that they just ommitted the manual hoping that I wouldn't notice it. To me that's poor service.On a positive note, it is the best back massaging tool (non-electric) I have ever used and is far better than theracane imho. I own both and this one gives a lot more leverage and have more versatility than theracane. Only advantage of theracane is that is is easier to pack away in a tote to take on a trip. I would give this product even 6 stars if it weren't for their lousy service. I ordered 3 more sets of this w/ accumassage. Had to pay $20 for shipping and they estimated 3-5 days shipping. 6 business days have passed (10 days total) and nothing yet. The tool delivers, but the company doesn't."
4,Good but Overpriced.,"I like the idea of this product and it does a really nice job of working the knots out. My only problem is the price... I think $20 would be a much more reasonable price for what it is, but I suppose it's still a fraction of the price of a massage so I'll cease complaining right there. :)"
4,drug free relief,"while i think the design could be better, i would recommend this for muscular back pain. it provides drug-free relief from pain for me. it's not a cure-all but helps a lot."
5,Great for spot massage,The Body Back Buddy is great. This is the only device I have found that allows me to pinpoint a tight spot in my back to work it loose. This is perfect for use in between massages. It is much better than using the door jamb. I can easily massage my feet also while watching TV.
4,Neck relief,Very good to relief the pain in the neck and lower back but not as easy to use as the Body Back Buddy Mini. It takes a little more practice.
5,big surprise!,"A friend of mine turned me onto these. Saw it in his house and thought it was some kind of torture device. Once he explained how it worked though, and I was able to use it, I was sold.I workout a lot and often have stiffness in my back. I get massages on a regular basis, but sometimes I need something NOW! Got one of these things and it helps me out considerably. For me, not as good as a professional, but it keeps me pain-free (more or less) until I can get on the table of my therapist.The one downside to this product is the size. It's not portable, so if you want one for more than a single location, you'll probably need to buy more than one. I need one for my office, which is what lead me to look here. This is a good price, by the way."
5,Completely awesome,"I saw one of these sitting in a friend's office a while back, and I had to ask what it was. Well, it turns out that I was having one of those days where I had slept wrong, and I had a massive knot in my back. Voila!I don't suffer from this malady often. Perhaps two or three times a year, I get one of those massive knots that restrict my movement for about a week. And then I move on. I guess I always thought it was just a part of life, but this tool has taught me otherwise. I have found that if I really dig one of the knobs into the knot, it helps to relax it and smooth out the pain. I have to be honest, though. A tennis ball in bed works a lot better. But I don't always have the luxury of running home to lay on a tennis ball to relieve my occasional knots. So I keep one of these at work, and it is extremely helpful.I have even found that just because I wake up in the morning with a knot doesn't mean I can't go golfing later in the day."
4,Muscle Release,When my Chirpractor told me to get the Body Back Buddy because it would save me money in Dr. bills I highly doubted him. My problem is tight muscles from overuse keeping them same positon for too long. Wirh thw Body Back Buddy you can get directly to the muscle a and with a little pressure can release that muscle. One of the best purchases I have made in a long time. Highly recommended.
5,brilliant product,Wow! This seemingly simple device is able to target every single muscle in my body. Its the only thing I've found that allows me to effectively massage my upper shoulders after a stressful day. Its also much sturdier than I expected--it seems very durable.
4,It works,"This product works like it says it will. It is easy to use. For people who live in all over chronic pain, it is not without some strain on your hands and wrists to deliver the necessary pressure to your trigger points, but it is worth the effort."
5,Love this thing,My massage therapist recommended this tool as an acupressure device I could use on myself. I bought one soon after and it has really helped me get to the knots I develop around my upper back and shoulder blades. I was so impressed with it I convinced my boss to get one for our office and now I hear people singing its praises all the time.
4,It seems to work well!,I have used this item in trigger point therapy and it allows me to hit trigger areas with pinpoint accuracy. The design allows for enough controlled pressure to be applied to reach deep trigger areas in the back.
2,2nd time leaving feedback...bad business for this company,"I left a previous review for this item saying how I received the item with no directions and just wrapped in a piece of paper..the company contacted me a few days later about rectifying the problem and that the instructions would be sent out promptly. They further said they would credit me a percentage for my troubles and also asked if I would remove the negative review. So, I did. Guess what??? Still no instructions sent to me and, no credit on my account....sorry but that is bad business. I would think twice about ever dealing with this company again!..as for the product, can't really tell you how it works...don't want to use it improperly and cause more damage then what already exists..."
2,Body Back Buddy,"A friend of mine had one of these that was made by a different manufacturer. I had tried hers and loved it so began searching for one of my own. I found this one and I must say, I do not like it nearly as well as others I have tried. It is not as easy to use and I didn't like the material and shape of it, it just didn't feel right for some reason. I would not buy this particular one again."
2,Disappointed,I bought this item expecting to use it for my back but it didn't come with an instruction booklet which was supposed to be included. Now it's a useless item. I wrote to the company who made it but they didn't even respond back.
2,not sure if it really works,"I bought this weird shape stick after having read all apprasing reviews. Are all these people real? I do not know what to do with this stick, really. I am thinking of returning it but I am aftraid I will pay too much for the shipping so it will not worth it. I agree with one who wrote that some people are making very good money on this..... I regret that I bought it."
4,Nice tool,"I bought the Body Back Buddy after a friend of mine let me borrow their Thera Cane, which I loved. I bought The Body Back Buddy thinking it would be superior to the Thera Cane due to the advanced design. However, now having used both, I would have bought the Thera Cane instead. With that said, I do use my Body Back Buddy often."
5,Great product,I think this is well worth the cost. I'm always trying to reach the knots in my back or making my husband massage them. This makes it easy for me to reach the spots myself.
4,Works Great,"This is the perfect tool to reach anywhere you have a knot. It doesn't come with a manuel but you can download one from the manufacturer's website. The main thing to consider, however, is that it is rather large, so if you're looking for something more portable you should chose one of the smaller versions."
5,Love it!,I love this for myself and also gave one to my mother as a gift and she is also pleased. Versatile and wonderful when you can't get someone else to give you a massage. You can print out an instructional guide from the internet.
2,Not for me,"I bought this because I suffer from neck, shoulder, and middle back pain. I thought this would help and give my poor boyfriend's hands a rest. I find this uncomfortable to use and not particularly effective for my problems. Even using it very lightly, the knobs hurt! Some of them are kind of scratchy, too, due to the material. I considered wrapping the knobs in some sort of fabric to make it softer, but decided to just return it instead. I can see how this might be helpful who had no other options (i.e. no one for massages), but it just isn't good for me. I've returned mine."
4,Covers it all,Great item. Covers all the pressure points without paying for a therapist at $85 for 30 minutes. Great remedy for what aches you.
3,Body Back Buddy too hefty for a small female...,"The Body Back Buddy I purchased on line looks like what is pictured. After seeing one similar to it in an LMP's office, I was expecting a size and weight of object, which would be easy to handle. This particular model is much 'beefier' than I need and expected."
3,Not quite as wonderful as advertised,"This is a sturdy piece of plastic with pointed tips that can certainly be used for a lot of different things, but don't expect to get some amazing massage to the pressure points on your back and shoulders from this device. Sure, you can use it to massage the back, just as you can use any pointed device to do the same (broom handle for example) but there is nothing about this device that does anything different. Be careful though - it's very easy to bruise the body with the hard plastic points. The instructions say use no more than 10-20 seconds in one area, but I would say even less than that.I will give them credit for creating an interesting conversation piece however, as everyone who looks at it immediately asks ""what is it""?"
3,large and clunky,"This product does what it is supposed to do, however it is large and difficult to store. If I buy another, I will choose a smaller version that is easier to manage."
2,Didn't work for me,"The ball ends just too pinpoint for me. Maybe I was not using it properly, but it did not relieve pain made it worse."
5,Love this tool,"Though the knob sizes don't vary much the shapes and angles of the knobs provide a wealth of pressure points to address. Because of it's length, there's a variety of different leverages and pressures it can apply unlike the smaller implements. I've gotten the most relief using this implement, I highly reccommend it."
1,Body back device,"It did not meet my needs as I had thought it would. I'm sure for others it would do fine, but not for me."
4,Body Back Buddy,This is a great tool for those with frozen shoulder problems as I have. I was surprised though to find that one of the protruding handles was broken off when it arrived. I have not contacted the seller about this because it still works fine for my needs. I did not want to interrupt my use of this product to ship it back and wait for a new replacement.
5,Great buy!,I'm very pleased with the speediness of the shipping and the quality of the product! Thank you very much!
5,My new best friend!,"I have fibromylagia, therefore I tend to be sore all the time. I am always desperate to ease the pain. Especially in my neck and shoulders. This gizmo really does the trick! I have problems with my hands, so I worried that it would be hard to hold onto, but it isn't. The Body Back Buddy really gives me the deep tissue pressure I need. I have taken to calling it my ""boyfriend"", because try as he might, my husband has never been able to work on my painful areas like this contraption can.If you have the need for deep pressure to release tight, sore, muscles I highly recommend this product!"
3,"Depending on your issue, this may not be right for you","I purchased this product specifically to target the area between my shoulder blades. Although it reaches this spot, there are a few issues. First, ""the device"", as it is called in my household, shipped without any instructions of any kind. Nothing. You can, however, BUY books that tell you how to use it... completely unacceptable in my book. I contemplated giving it one star just for this. Second, because you need at least one hand to manipulate, it's harder to reach my trouble area than it is for, say, a tennis ball. Finally, it's hard plastic and not as comfortable as a tennis ball.I gave ""the device"" three stars since it basically does what it's supposed to, just not up to my expectations. My advice... buy some tennis balls or base balls."
4,Works great...sometimes,"This allows you to access and massage away trigger points (painful knots within muscles) virtually anyplace in your body). That being said, it can be difficult to find the painful trigger point, and often difficult to massage away the pain depending on the trigger point location. For example, anywhere on the thigh can be easy but near the middle of the back around the lower edge of the scapula can be difficult to find and figure out how to massage.The Body Back Buddy allows the application of massage pressure, and leverage virtually anyplace once you learn how for that location.There are books on trigger point massage that would be a very useful supplement to the rather paltry users manual that comes with Body Back Buddy."
5,Hit the Spots,"The Body Back Buddy helped the first time I used it after the first 5 minutes, I could feel the effects. It reached my shoulders completely where I hadn't been able to reach. It felt so much better from the pain I was use to. Very glad I purchased it."
5,Concerning C & C of Thailand,"Excellent book shipped in excellent time in excellent condition.Although it was several years old, it still had enough valuable information to help me get an A on my college-level project on Thailand."
1,Very Dissappointed,Well it started off well. Really liked the product and then 3 months into using it the high heat just doesn't work! The lower settings work but the high heat and high blow speed just doesn't work. Useless at this point. So off to spend $$ on something else.
5,"Review of CRIMINAL SHADOWS, INNER NARRATIVES OF EVIL","Having a strong interest in true crime, with an emphasis on the psychology behind the criminal mind, I found this book imformative and entertaining. Unlike many books in this gendre it does not explore extensive graphic crime detail, but sufficient to provide an example of a point being made. The book wonderfully details a very scientific approach to understanding the criminal mind and profiling. It is interesting how a strong emphasis is placed on geographic profiling, the book explains the reasons for this.Clearly anyone who has studied some basic psychology and the works of well known 'theorists' will enjoy some sections more than those who haven't. If you haven't don't worry there are many sections anyone interested in the subjuct matter will find facinating. You may well discover a little about yourself.Overall if you are interested in psychological profiling and how it works get a copy and have a read."
2,Lame,"This was a really boring book. You would think that a book about profiling serial killers would at least be interesting, but its not. He basically talks about his personal experiences in studying/profiling murderers. I bought this book for a profiling methodology class and I really wish I could return it."
3,Eh.. it's okay.,"Honestly the thing is made for crap, but my husband likes it.. The finish suffered immensely in spots that you cannot see thankfully. Also not very secure. You definitely get what you pay for. We know it's cheap, didn't expect much."
2,Not the best craftsmanship,"I bought this letter holder after doing extensive research online. But when it arrived the product was damaged in multiple spots. The box itself wasn't damaged, but on the letter holder there were a bunch of chips, dings, and even the tip of nail poking through where you hang your keys. NOT THE BEST QUALITY. Maybe the damage to mine was a fluke and other people's arrived in great condition, but I think I'll just return it and find a different one to buy."
3,"Smaller than I imagined, but does the job","I knew this was going to be small, but it's even smaller than I imagined. It's slightly wider than a 2 switch light cover. It still does the job for most mail, but it's not wide enough for some things like netflix dvds and ads."
3,Nice affordable mail organization,"It was a little smaller than expected, so I would advice to check the demensions carefully so you know what you're getting. We also had to fix a little bit with wood glue because it got chipped in transit, I'm assuming. But looks nice and is very helpful."
2,not the same in the picture,"when i was searching for one of these it was for my mom for a christmas gift this year. That was all she asked for. When I saw this one I liked it. it looked nice, big enough to hold letter without them hanging over and it also looked like it could hold them sideways.But when she got it and opened it up. It was totally different. Not at all what the picture looked like. I was very disappointed. Of course she hung it up. i dont understand if your going to advertise a product and someone buys it atleast send the one that is advertised.Other than the size it is nice work. I love the light color of the wood."
1,"Disappointed, not worth its price","Like other reviewers said, the Letter rack is smaller and its qualityis not great. Mine had some scratches. Definitely not a 20 dollar productwhich is what i paid. Even the hangers look so cheap.I would pay max 10 dollars for being a cheap Chinese product."
3,The Key hooks are pretty small,I bought it as a key holder and holding the rest was just a good idea.... well the key hooks are pretty small but overall it's a decent product.
2,Too Small!,This product is way to small to hold any mail.... if you are looking for something to hold your mail in do some research first this only holds up to an index card size envelope!
1,Too small!,It looks nice but way too small. Even a big letter won't fit in it. Wish they could make it bigger because I like the way it looks.
2,Broke quickly,Mine fell off the hook and shattered into pieces. It's very cheaply made; pieces held together by staples and glue. Typical Chinese junk. Only it's not really that cheap. $25 is too much for this thing.
4,Nice rack!,"This rack is very nice. The only complaint is that it is a little on the small side. But, it looks very nice on the wall and serves as a great mail holder."
3,Banboo Mail Rack,"No hanging hardware in the box, no key hooks, pockets are shallow, mail sticks out too much. I'm not too impressed with this product"
1,Looks solidly built but no installation help.,How did they think we supposed to install it on the wall or door? The metal thingy that supposed to be put in the hook is so small that nothing will fit into it. I guess I will unscrew it and put mounting tape on it.And do not try to put nail through it. It split when I tried it.
1,not what the item looked like on line,This was not what was pictured on line! The discription on line states that this is made of beachwood. When I received it the box states its BAMBOO. I think there is a little bit of a differance between the two woods. Also the discription states there are 3 hooks for keys. The one I received had no hooks at all. I think this will be the last time I buy from Amazon.
1,Wat too small,Didn't notice the dimensions of this. Picture looks like decent size. Actually way too small. A few envelopes and magazines and it will be full. Had to return it and lost money on shipping it back.
2,Needs a lot of work,"this isn't a very good album it needs a lot of work in production, the rappers are just ok"
3,Decent read but don't know if I would recommend to a friend,"The first three chapters of this book delve into the personality and psyche of the main character. I had to push to make it through these pages, because everything could easily have been summed up in a few pages. The guy is dull and boring, he went to Yale (which comes up far too often throughout the book...we got it the first time), and his wife left him for his best friend. Seriously, by the end of Chapter 3, with all his whining, I could see why she left him.That being said, once you get into Chapters 4 and 5, the book definitely gets better. The plot is interesting and you keep guessing how it is going to end, you just have to really force yourself to get to those chapters.So, overall, it wasn't terrible but it didn't warrant more than a mediocre rating. The author's other book, The Thing About Jane Spring, is better."
2,Decent...but it was done two years ago,"This is a decent book -- strictly decent -- sheds little in the way of light onto the cult of celebrity that keeps popping up in first fiction. Specifically, a novel a few years ago called Fake Liar Cheat by Tod Goldberg handled the subject of unwitting fame in a funny, dark way that this novel does not yet quite approach. The sense is that the author likes the scene and aches for the acceptance herself. No one wants to read a book that seems counterintuitive to the author's true goals. The book does serve as a decent beach read but fails to strike new ground. If you want the primers, get Fake Liar Cheat, or Day of the Locust or even Why Sammy Ran."
4,"""Keep moving forward""","""Meet the Robinsons"", directed by Stephen Anderson, is an excellent film for kids, and also for the kind of adults that love good animated movies. I am one of them :)The main character is Lewis, a 12-year old orphan that is a science whiz. Lewis' biggest dream is to have a family of his own, but he hasn't been able to get adopted. When, after a particularly stinging rejection from a prospective family due to an experiment gone wrong, Lewis fails miserably at a science fair, his confidence is crushed and he ready to give up on science. Life has many surprises in store for him, though, among them a trip to the future and tons of new friends, that will teach him that, in order to achieve success, all you really need to do is keep moving forward.On the whole, I can say that I really liked this quirky and engaging Disney movie. It is a family film with a very good message, that also happens to be lots of fun. Recommended...Belen Alcat"
3,Disappointment,"I was charged $4 extra, I thought this movie cam with a sleeve so I paid the extra $4 dollars. However, this movie doesn't come with a Disney sleeve."
5,Funny Sweet,"This is a family favorite - off the usual animated story, very well written and funny while still sweet - highly recommend for you or to share with the kidlets!"
5,I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!,"Just as the title says, I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!! I loved it so much that I'm going to see it again and I already bought the video game. Plus, I am going to buy the book. I can't believe my mom and dad didn't like it (i know, it's crazy) but I think it's the best movie ever since The Incredibles. I LOVE Lewis, Wilbur, Frannie, Tiny--almost all of the characters, but most of all Wilbur and Tiny. :) SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T!!! YOU'LL REGRET IT IF YOU DON'T!!!"
4,Takes original Walt Disney message to heart,"This is a darling little movie that I fear has been underappreciated. As others noted, it's not a Pixar film, and doesn't have the Pixar animation quality to it. It is, however, animated nicely and looked very nice on the big screen (where I had taken my family to watch it originally) and comes through beautifully on the Blu-ray format.The Blu-ray version of this movie comes loaded with tons of extras and really pays off nicely. It is well worth adding to any collection, but is a must for Disney collectors for sure. For some fans, this might be a 5 star movie, and in my case, it's at least a 4.5 but sadly the rating system doesn't support half stars and I can't quite put this movie into the rare air of a Disney-Pixar partnership such as Toy Story and the like."
4,Meet the Robinsons,"Fabulous, I saw in 3D with my grandchildren. We loved it!! Well done!Meet the Robinsons"
4,Good but not great...,A good family movie and looks great in hi-def. Not quite the quality of story as seen in the Pixar films though... A little overbearing at times with the message as well.
4,Disney's Back,"Although it isn't the Disney magic that we all grew up with, Meet the Robinsons is a step in the right direction for Disney. It's been a while since I have enjoyed a Disney movie this much. A bit dark for smaller children, but heartwarming overall."
3,What just happened,"Though this movie is dazzling to watch, it is dizzying at the same time. I found the pace of this movie to be much too fast. The dialouge is like the micro-machine man of 80's TV commercial fame. While this may appeal to some children, my daughter kept asking me, ""What did he say?""The slapstick is fast and furious, but the story lacks the depth and charm of Ratatouille. This is a great family movie, although it will appeal more to the 8-12 year-old range. Not bad, but I liked Toy Story and Ratatouille much more."
4,An Entertaining Romp,"Meet the Robinsons is about a boy who creates a memory capture machine to find the mother who left him to foster care. But people from the future have different plans for his invention, and Louis is taken into the future where he meets a family full of odd quirks. The style and art are very reminiscent of Jimmy Neutron, glossy, fun and entertaining.The adventure to fix matters turns out to be quick-paced with lots of thrilling visuals, wrapping up too soon. The story has its heart in the right place, and it's an enjoyable ride. The Danny Elfman score is sticky in its sweetness. The theme ties in nicely with a quote from creative visionary, Disney. It's a film you can enjoy with your family."
5,Awesome,this is a great purchase...i really loved this movie and the disc comes with so many extras...worth the purchase
5,LOVE the theme of this movie!,"This movie is a big hit with my 3 yr old twins and my 4 yr old. They laughed and were entertained for the length of the whole movie. We have watched it at least twice a day since we bought it. And I absolutely LOVE the theme of the movie....KEEP MOVING FORWARD. Louis, the boy who is the star of the movie, is so discouraged by his failures. His soon to be future family finds a way to show him that failure is awesome b/c it brings you one step closer to success! Such a great lesson for my little preschoolers, who struggle daily with independence and get frustrated easily. Now we just say, 'keep moving forward' and they smile, and try again...most of the time!"
4,Good family movie.,"A little bit confusing at parts, but overall a good movie for the whole family to sit down and watch."
3,Okay,"There are better choices, but this movie was okay. My 3yo kind of lost interest about half way through it."
4,such a cute family movie,"The product I received was perfectly wrapped with everything new. I bought it because I had already seen it and loved it, so I bought a few copies to give as Christmas presents for my nieces and nephews. It's funny and touching."
4,Good fun for everybody,"Meet The Robinsons is a great movie for both kids and adults. It has a good story (although not on the same level as a pixar movie). The animation is also good, simplistic. I had a chance to see the movie in the theatre in 3D which was really amazing, but unfortunately, the disc does not offer the 3D version. This was somewhat disappointing, but the movie is still worth a purchase."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I got the DVD just for the Rex part. I was so pleasantly surprised that this had a very touching story line! What a nice family movie! My son (14) watched it first when he was sick, and thought it was way better than he expected. It peaked my curiosity to hear him say that so I decided to watch it. Boy was I in for a pleasant surprise! We had family night, and I broke out the movie. My daughter (16) and husband really enjoyed it, and my son and I enjoyed it for the second time! I would gladly recommend this DVD to anyone!"
4,good entertainment for young and old,"I loved the it , my grandson loved it and so did my son in law who I bought it for!!"
1,odd issues,first time we watched it the signs were in spanish. Can't to the menu option. Very unhappy with this purchase.
4,Meet The Robinsons,Great children's movie. My nephew loved receiving it for his birthday. The product was perfect and I received it in just under a week in plenty of time for the birthday party.
3,"Good, but predictable movie","Most of the characters in the movie are random and seem to have been shoe-horned into the story.It was enjoyable, though."
5,Meet The Robinsons,Watching this movie on Disney Blu-ray was better than in the theatre. The sound was more pronounced and the picture was sharper. I noticed more inn this version than in the theatre or on DVD. Fantastic family movie that teaches values and the true meaning of family.
3,So-so ROBINSONS. Very average and somewhat dull,"Something happened! In a film called MEET THE ROBINSONS I never really met them. What I mean is that these characters, The Robinsons, were so undeveloped that I could not see why the title was named for them.I would have maybe called it LOUIS AND THE BOWLER HAT MAN (a little long,but face it, these were the main characters in this film.) For all of it's animated charm, something was so uneven and unsettled about the direction that this screenplay wanted to go.There were eleven writers on this screenplay.Here is my rub: great CGI animation,but a really mixed-bag story line that drags in many places.Somewhat entertaining ,but definitely not my favorite animated flicks."
5,Surprisingly excellent,"I thought the movie would be pretty good and a nice two-hour getaway with the kids. I was surprised that I loved every minute of the movie. Funny, fast-moving, great plot, interesting characters and a teary-eyed ending. Will definitely be purchasing this one."
4,Outstading use of DVD capabilities,"I bought the Region 4 version, and I am amazed to see that the language you choose when you put the DVD into the player changes every important text inside the movie. I don't mean the subtitles, I mean text INSIDE the movie: The motto ""Keep moving forward"" in Carl's sign becomes ""Camina hacia el futuro"" if you chose Spanish; ""Science fair"" becomes ""Feria de ciencias"", and even the oil painting featuring Tom Selleck becomes a picture of José Luis Rodríguez if you choose Spanish instead of English. Kudos to Disney for this outstanding use of DVD capabilities! I think I'll re-watch the whole movie in English just to see every sign changed to English. And kudos for making full use of the 16x9 screen. Most kids are not purists and don't care about the skinny 2.35:1 aspect ratio."
5,Buying both Bluray Toy Stories was an excellent deal!!,After the all the discounts Bluray Toy Story I and Toy Story II came out to $15 each. You can't beat it!!
2,Boring!,This movie was a disapointment compared to the Incrediables. At first it was kind of interesting but then it got so unreal. Frogs were singing and ex... THen to make things worse the humor wasn't all that great and the story got boring toward the end. This movie is not the best movie for all ages it's most likely for very young children because how boring and unreal. They over did the crazy part. That is why I think if you want a good faimly movie then check out the Incrediables or High School muscical.Apple
2,Great Movie - flawed DVD playback,"Great family movie, terrific cgi and a cute storyline.But the standard version DVD continues to flash an annoying icon in the upper righthand corner of the screen as if someone has tried to select an alternate viewing angle, even though none has been selected. This has happened on two copies of the DVD we've purchased. Are other people experiencing this? Is this possibly a flaw since the DVD is also produced on Blu-Ray (which I don't have) where they may have provided alternate views (or other material that you can jump out to during playback) which the standard version doesn't have but is may be trying to access?"
2,Not very enjoyable for adults,I suppose this is a good one for the kids 10 and under but for adults it is barley bearable. I enjoyed Monster House and Ratatoie much more than this one.
2,Meet the Robinsons Once,"I never saw the movie before buying it. I bought it because it's Blu-ray and animated - animated movies are look great in 1080p. I bought this movie based on the wrong reasons. Although a decent and fun story, the movie is only worth seeing once. Netflix it. Don't buy it."
2,Not a good film for children.,"If you were an adopted child, this was not a good experience. You go back through time, and it is the only chance you will have to see your mother. To turn away at the last minute, you have pined for this moment your entire childhood. The whole concept stinks!That bouncing around with very little plotline also stinks!"
5,Grandson's Choice,Grandson asked for it and loved it. The grandparents even liked it and glad we listened to him and ordered it. We like the ones we can sit and watch too.
5,Excellent Feel Good Movie,"This movie had the classic messages that inspire and lift you up so you want to watch it over and over again. ""Let it go. Keep Moving Forward."" The understanding that failure helps people learn was a wonderful idea. The animation was put together well and was fun to watch. The villain was adorable and funny. Once the main character was able to let go of his self-destructive thinking he was free to make the universe right again. I loved this story!"
5,Keep Moving Forward,"This is a fabulous movie. The animation, the message - it was all spot-on. The lesson that one takes away from this is a powerful yet simple one: Don't look back. The past is over. Keep looking forward. Keep moving forward. The movie itself is complex, though don't under estimate the younger viewers. Our two year old daugher loves this movie more than any other, and I can say that she gets it. She reminds us often that when something happens, there is always tomorrow. The future has arrived!"
3,Grows on You,"Not insanely non-stop as some other Disney animation, this film takes time (get it?) to win you over. Cute though and all about the value of trying and failing."
5,Premature Review,"I haven't seen this DVD, but the cover artwork looks sweet and I would guess the movie itself would be sweet too, because why go to all the trouble of producing first-rate artwork for the cover if the movie itself sucks. That wouldn't make any sense. So I am giving this film 5 stars! I am planning to enjoy the pants off it! And rewatch it again and again. A classic... probably!"
3,MEET THE ROBINSONS,I purchased this for a fried who loved the movie and decided he needed to have it.
4,about the case?,"I need an answer to a question concerning the case. I recently bought a used Meet the Robinsons movie and it had a cheap flimsy case wirh a frame backing covered over with transparent material. Did Disney do that or did the seller? I don't want to make a false accusation against the seller, but I can't amagine Disney doing such a thing. Would you please respond. I need to know one way or the other."
4,Good Old Fashioned Pot Boiler Fun,"Bette Davis plays Bette Davis not once but twice in this over-the-top story of a sister who kills and then replaces her twin. The result is a thoroughly far-fetched and yet somewhat predictable thriller that succeeds in being a tremendous amount of fun.Karl Malden and Peter Lawford fill out the cast, but the film belongs to Davis, and she clearly relishes the film's every excess, owning the script like a tailor-made gown. Indeed, much of the pleasure in watching DEAD RINGERS is the fun of seeing Davis play with such little restraint, and the movie makes use of every Davis mannerism imaginable.This movie will never make any critic's short list, and over her long career Davis certainly made a great many finer films and gave a great many more artful performances. But as a late-night popcorn fest for Bette Davis fans, DEAD RINGERS is hard to beat."
4,A somewhat overlooked camp classic,"I hesitate to use the term 'camp' for fear that it makes it sound like this is a bad movie. It's not; it definitely holds your attention. Davis's performance, though at times going a little over the top, is basically convincing. Interesting that Davis here repeats her stint of playing dual roles (twins) just as she did in A Stolen Life, and repeats the process of conveniently assuming the place of a dead twin (just like in A Stolen Life), this time with new moral ambiguity. I've seen this one two or three times since my youth and always enjoy it."
5,DEAD RINGER,"DEAD RINGER is one of Bette Davis' best works in the later part of hercarreer. Her anguish,pain, and fear can be experienced by the viewer asyou follow her road of no return."
3,Davis a legend,After seeing Whatever happened to Baby Jane I looked forward to this movie. Must admit I was quite disappointed in the film as such but Davis remains a legend. I will recommend this movie for its excellent performance but it is not on the same level as Baby Jane.
2,Just bad,"This film is bad. I love me some Bette Davis and even her bad movies are good, but this one just crosses the line. For her to think she would ever get away with it is beyond ridiculous, a miscast Karl Malden over-acts atrociously and the ending lands with a resounding and very predictable thud. Just not a very good film. Check out ""A Stolen Life"" for a better Davis-as-twins film."
4,Very watchable noir,"If you've ever toyed with the idea of faking your own death, this is the cautionary tale for you. Bette Davis plays an unhappy woman who murders her twin sister and assumes the dead woman's identity. From that point on, she is plagued by irony, until it becomes clear that she and her sister were much more alike than she ever imagined."
3,Blu-ray Bette Davis!,"Always great to watch Bette Davis!!! - but the quality of this blu-ray transfer isn't that much better than the dvd release. A bit more detail certainly, but not enough to warrant you buying another copy of 'Dead Ringer' - entertaining though it certainly is!"
3,A Stolen Life,"Bette Davis plays twins Maragret and Edith. Maragret lied and told Frank she was pregrant. When she was not. He dump Edith and married her. Edith has been mad with Maragret ever since. At Frank's furneal she sees her sister and Maragret invites her home with her. She flaunts all her riches in Edith's face and still lies about her and Frank's ""child"". That's where the plots begins. This is a good movie. Nothing special but good. Also Margarets lover comes over and try to sleep with Edith when he realize she not accepting his advances like Maragret did he knows that this sister is not the one he thought she was and the blackmail and the fun begins. A good Bette Davis movie not nothing to write home about but it will do."
3,Dead Ringer,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Bette at her most tacky,"This movie is only worth watching if you are a die-hard Bette Davis fan, otherwise, forget it. This is also Bette at the end of her amazing career, a sort of last gasp before age and a string of mediocre movies forced her into semi-retirement. This is her last decent film, though it drags in long stretches and the plot is silly, contrived and stupid. Peter Lawford gives a thoroughly forgetable performance as her boyfriend. Karl Malden is good, but his character is pathetically stupid. Wake up, Karl, your girlfriend is a murderer!If you love Bette Davis, you'll watch her recite the phone book. I require a little more than that to give it a thumb's up."
3,It's ok,"Nice little compelation of King's. Sounds to be 40's/50's era. No liner notes of any worth, unfortunately."
4,Great content; poor manufacture,"As a big fan of Andrea Camilleri, I was happy to see that his stories translated well onto the screen. (The subtitles are fairly accurate, too, enough for the story lines). However the production value on the DVDs is poor. Of the first three episodes, in the middle of two of them, the picture began jumping and breaking up. It does correct itself a few minutes further, after we stopped and restarted the DVD. Also at times the sound isn't in sync with the dialogue. But very entertaining and atmospheric and the casting is excellent. For the hand gestures alone, the series is well worth it!"
4,Detective Montalbano Series,"Excellent series with superb character development. This series seems to capture the Italian male psyche perfectly and the humor is strictly Italian throughout. The main character, Montalbano, is not without his flaws, but he always tries to do what is right (in his mind and this generally agrees with that of the audience). A joy to watch."
4,limited review...,"I found this book to be quite useful for learning R, and for pointing out the pitfalls for new users. It's especially good to know that there is a website associated with the book that will allow you to download the code used in the book.There are several good free R resources out there, but in the end I think you get what you pay for. In this case it was nice to have a hard-bound reference with an index and appendix that I could highlight and dog-ear.I mostly used it as a book for learning R, and not as a stats book. I did notice that there were many good examples of common statistical applications, such as t-stat tests, residual plotting, and the like. In other words, I feel like I got my money's worth by just using a few chapters and the appendix."
2,"Should have bought ""The R Book"" Instead....","I got this book over Crawley's (The R Book) since the Amazon reviews said that this one was more organized than Crawley's.. however, even if that is true (maybe.. but Crawley's organization does not bother me), this book does not have half of what ""The R Book"" has, and their GLM chapter is a poor explanation of the function.I highly recommend purchasing Crawley's book over this one. This one is not horrible, but was not sufficient for me. Lucky for me I have online access to Crawley's book for free, which has saved me in some spots, along w/ the online R-help websites and list serves.This book definitely doesn't hurt to have though, but if you are looking to only buy one book, I would not rely solely on this one."
4,Excellent reference book,"If you are like me and prefer to learn a programming languange and the capabilities of a language by examples, then this is an excellent reference. Yes there are writeups that describe the language that come with R that are excellent, as is the built in help functions, but going through this book provides a very organized and comprehensive tour through R."
4,Game to Crawley,"This is going to be brief. I am appreciative of ""Data analysis and graphics using R"", but it is not a viable competitor to ""R Book"" by Michael Crawley, even in its first edition. DAAG goes deeper on some topics, but these local advantages do not change the conclusion."
3,Wanna know about the Dark Side?,"Guy Hart-Davis gives the reader a full picture of the Internet and its underbelly. Although it can be a ""how-to"" book for violating intellectual property, it is nevertheless informative. Software and music download sites are thoroughly covered, but the information, naturally, quickly becomes out-of-date."
4,DVD is bare bones,"I'm not going to comment much on this movie other than it is one of my favorites of all time. It's not for everyone but if you like the spoof genre, you'll like this movie produced by the Zucker Brothers (""Airplane!"") and written by Pat Proft (""Wrongfully Accused"")Unfortunately, the DVD has no features or previews or anything. There isn't even any music on the title page. So don't expect anything more than the movie when you buy this cult classic."
4,A True Cult Movie,"A short word on Brain Donors (1992): Get it. I don't even think it was featured for a full week at the cinemas, but it made cable and that's where I found it. It is truly a great fast talking Marx Brothers movie--but made fifty years later. John Turturro is Groucho, Mel Smith is an English Chico and Bob Nelson is not quite a mute Harpo. But that's all right, we needed a new Marx Brother movie anyhow, and these guys will do. It's truly a clone of ""Night At The Opera"" but dressed up nineties-style and ballet instead of opera. So get it anyway and be prepared to laugh. By the way it came from the group that did Naked Gun and Hot Shots! movies, so you will know what you are in for. Enjoy!"
3,"Funny, but could have been better","A Marx Brothers homage with John Turturro in the Groucho role. Plot is incidental with some scenes directly out of Marx Brothers films. Unfortunately the other two actors opposite Turturro are not nearly as funny. Still, good for a few laughs when you're in the mood."
5,Better than the Marx brothers.,"Great hilarious movie based on the Marx bros ""a night at the opera"". It may seem tough but it's better and with far more laughs than the original movie. A must see! But beware! You may hurt yourself watching it... from the laughs!"
5,Easily an underrated classic,"John Turturro, Bob Nelson, and Mel Smith turn in a gem of a comic performance in this tribute to teh ""Zanni"" style of comedy. Leonard Maltin's review says the film tends to fall flat, but the energy manifested by these three top notch performers, as well as a sterling cast (even to the addition of Spike Alexander, a great dancer but easily the world's least believeable actor-I mean, the guy can't even turn the pages of a magazine convincingly-as the ""romantic lead"") carries onthe tradition set down by the Marx Brothers.If Groucho were alive today, he would want you to see this movie. If Harpo were alive, I would keep an eye on your girlfriend."
2,Funny? - Yes. Original? - NO!,"This movie is funny but some original ideas could've been put into it. If you've seen the Marx Brothers - 'A Night At The Opera', then you've seen Brain Donors. Brain Donors have just about every scene from ' A Night At The Opera' from the 'Too Crowded Room' to changing the music during the performance. They're all there except in a differant order. See it if you want, but I'm sticking with the Marx Brothers."
5,"Lillian,Lazlo.. my 2 favorite L's^_^","This is a timeless piece of slapstick cinema that is truly missing in todays ""conedies"" if you will. Its a treat to see the colorful cast of cooks and the laughs are fast paced. Watch enjoy and have a ball"
5,So beautiful and practical!,I used my buffet server for the first time at my New Year's party. I loved it. It went from oven to table and the pork roast remained warm throughout the evening. I am planning on buying another one. I wish Cuisinart made this buffet server for lasagna too!
5,Good buffet server,"I bough three sizes: this one, the rectangle and the oval one. I like them all but my favorite is the deep round one that I used to serve my signature prawn dish. The food was still warm for about two hours. Please note: warm not boiling. First, I heated up the food in the buffet pan on the stove to make sure that the food and pan were hot enough. Then, I set up the buffet set on the table. The food was quite warm, I could see the steam coming out of the pan when guests opened up the lid.Pro:- You cook directly using the buffet pan.- Warm food for a least 2 hours, depending on how hot the buffet pan is at the beginning of the buffetCons:- The pan is not as shiny as before just after one use. In the manual, it might be caused by hard water. So I will have to get stainless steel cleaner."
4,Delighted with my purchase,I thought it was somewhat smaller than what i imagined but the quality and look makes up for this! Would have liked to know what size (in terms of quart) it was though! Can't wait to present this to my guests!!!
2,"Not bad, but not 1.1","The book is well organized and has lots of useful information in it. What really bothers me about it is that even though it advertises itself as being ""1.1"" many of the examples are in fact in 1.0. They have a small disclaimer that says that new features have examples in 1.1 and while old features are in 1.0. Can you say lazy?"
2,A regurgitation of the freely available Java API references,"Although this book does a good job ofpresenting the AWT API, most of what ispresented is available in pretty much thesame form as part of the standard JavaAWT documentation. More examples that tietogether all the concepts would havebeen appreciated. A good example of thisis Dan Heller's excellent Motif book (Vol. 6A)from ORA."
3,NOT for neophytes,"This book is NOT for beginners.It's not good, that my main complaint is I have to think too much to understand it."
4,An existential apologetic,"Unlike many books on apologetics, Chesterton does not present carefully crafted arguments using e logical method. Instead he examines the paradoxes and everyday experiences of life and claims that Christianity better explains life than alternate worldviews. His ideas are more a collections of life's observations rather than a carefully crafted polemic. Chesterton does have a flair for language and uses many analogies to illustrate his points. If you are looking for a book to quote there are many good quotable points in this book. Note that the title of the book is orthodoxy but don't expect very much defense of any specific orthodox Christian doctrine. This is more of a general apologetic with a well-written and very literary style"
4,I bought for Kindle after borrowing from the public library.,The paperback had lots of footnotes explaining terms that are not familiar to most readers. These do not appear on the Kindle version.
1,Horrible Formatting,"This book has THE WORST formatting I've ever seen. It looks like it was hastily put together using Microsoft Word. Very amateurish. The cover doesn't even have the title on the spine, so I can't recognize it on my bookshelf.The version from BiblioBazaar:Orthodoxyis MUCH MUCH better, well worth the extra dollar or two."
3,Circle Talk at its Best,"This book is both dull and magnificent. Chesterton's writing style is brilliant even though often his writing is pointless. Like a trial lawyer engaged in circle talk he says a mouthful but at the same time, although eloquent, it is a mouthful of nothing. Much like a gorgeous flower it is best to view it than ingest it. So this book too is better lightly read than seriously studied."
5,Would give six stars!,There really should be a six star option for this brilliant book.The tendency toward insanity for mathematicians in comparison with the relative mental/spiritual health of poets has enormous implications for all of us.I don't know of any other book that so effortlessly offers such incisive and witty insights.This is definitely a book you read and then reread.
5,What a great book!,This book put a smile on my face. The thoughts he records here are all things I wish I could have thought of. The brilliant simplicity of syle was refreshing and thought provoking. Highly recommended. No problems with the Kindle version.
5,Chesterton's Humor and Perspective,"G.K. Chesterton has a down to earth perspective and sense of humor that is uncommon to most Christian writing today. He is willing to pick on himself, and admits to making arguments with faulty logic at some points, but is still a collosal genious, and is a known early influence of C.S. Lewis. If you have already read C.S. lewis, you can see some of Chesterton's thoughts comming through in his works, having read this book.""A soldier surrounded by enemies... He must seek his life in a spirit of furious indifference to it; he must desire life like water and yet drink death like wine."" - G.K Chesterton from ""Orthodoxy"""
2,Hard to follow,The author is very long winded and hard to follow. I would suggest a different book if you do not want to have to wade through all the idle chatter.
4,Theology with pub cosiness,"A nice, quick read with convincing arguments about the inevitable dead end of the ""progessive"" nature of Evolution contrasted with the ""conservative"" values of Christianity. Plenty of wit on display and a barbed pen to take on GB Shaw, HG Wells, and Oscar Wilde among other notables. Here's to fairy tales."
4,Great old book for free!,"This book has some great stuff in it. Chesterton takes a wonderfully road through personal experience theology and philosophy to explain God, the human condition and how they intersect."
4,Excellent Book but hard read,"I've read Chesterton before and always enjoy his work. This was another excellent piece but, as with his other writings, it is a difficult read. I will have to read it several time to get the full value of the book. Some of the difficulty may come from the unfamiliar phrases and wordings of his time period and much of it may be that I am certainly not the scholarly type. I would recommend the book, but only to those with some background in reading and studying historical and theological writing."
2,Orthodoxy,"Chesterton no doubt was a brilliant man! In Orthodoxy he does not write for the common person, but for philosophers and intellectuals who enjoy such semantics. I had wished he had expressed his ideas more simply: i.e. in parables and analogies, like his Lord did, but such is very hard to do! As a preacher of the gospel I was disappointed with much of the book for this reason."
1,How to make an argument without an argument,This book exemplifies the art of arguing a position without a foundation:Step 1: Quote a statement from a criticStep 2: Attribute a made up meaning to that statementStep 3: Contrive an argument against the false meaning to that statement that you attributed to it yourselfStep 4: Be called a genius by anyone looking for for a book that affirms their beliefsStep 5: Go down in history as a pretentious antiintellectual with a penchant for the English language
1,Misleading Title - Dated Book,"Having come recently to the Orthodox faith, I eagerly cracked the covers of G.K. Chresterton's ORTHODOXY, The Romance of Faith. What I found was a carmudgeon's rantings, which for the most part consisted of points that had faulty underpinnings. More disturbing still was the underlying racism and elitism woven throughout the fabric of this so-called testimonal on faith. Fortunatley for me, this book isn't even actually about Orthodoxy, but about Roman Catholicism, and Anglicanism, so my burgeoning faith is still safe from the likes of Chesterton."
5,Great read - great author,Mr. Chesterton does it again. Great read with many insights and several surprises. I highly recommend for any Christian who seeks a higher understanding and unique insights.
4,Soul On Board,"One of the most underated singers in pop or rock.Curt has a lot of talent ,a lot of people think that Roland was Tears For Fears alone, granted he is a great songwriter and guitarist but he missed something when Curt left hopefully the last album from a few years ago won't be there last.as for this album it is a pretty good album and a shame that it's out of print as you see it going for $50 as an import.the best songs are Calling Out which was a single great song,Soul On Board,and Beautiful To Me which sounds like a Peter Gabriel song great vocals by Curt,Words also could of been a hit good song, the worst song is the last one Come The Revolution which has some annoying raps on it.not a classic album but worth having just for the few songs I mentioned.the record Curt made with a rock band Mayfield was a better album also hard to find but good to add to your Tears For Fears collection."
4,Tears for Fears...Not!,"If you are purchasing this item for the Tears for Fears aspect...look elsewhere. I have everything that ""Tears for Fears"" put out; the material here resembles little of the Tears for Fears style except for maybe some of the work on ""Sowing the Seeds"". Yet this is a likeable work...a bit upbeat. Tears for Fears fans will recognize Curt's unique tone quality...but the music itself lacks the ""edge"" of Roland Orzabal who of course continued the Tears for Fears name for a number of albums after splitting. But that's ok with me...the music has an upbeat adult contemporary feel to it... not a special song, but easy to listen to as a whole album. I also own the Mayfield album which I like a bit more...but for those looking for something new, I do recommend this!"
3,A Vital Piece of History for TFF Fans,"I didn't find this to be a great CD in and of itself. Yes a couple of the songs are pretty good, but the overall value of the CD is in putting together more of the story about what was happening post break-up to the two branches of sound from the the TFF tree. My rating would depend on the person buying it. A big TFF fan would want it as part of their collection as a sort of missing link between TFF and Mayfield, but as a stand alone CD to a casual listener...you may want to look at his newer stuff."
4,VERY GOOD,"I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY PERSON WITH HYPERTENSION, YOU WILL SEETHE NUMBERS GO DOWN IN A WEEK."
2,Mild addiction - beware,"I take these with a multivitamin. After three weeks of following the directions.... I stopped. I would get headaches... I didn't know what it was. I would be away from home and get headaches. When I would be home and have access to my supply I would be just fine, but again if I couldn't have them I would get headaches. I made the correlation when I took ed them and after an hour or so my ridiculous hangover would go away. Then I dropped them like a bad habit.Don't know if they did any good. Waste of money."
2,A Scholarly Work...Without Page Numbers?,"This is strictly a structural review for the Kindle edition. This is a fine piece of scholarship, but with no page numbers in the Kindle edition, it will be impossible to cite without comparing to a hard copy of the book. I expected more for $15."
3,"Reasonable quality, but!",This product relies on the user having 20/20 vision. There is no way to mechanically shorten (or lengthen) the distance from the lens to the target to obtain sharp focus. Using this item with glasses is not the optimal viewing situation.
4,NIce Big 10x Loupe,"I like the size of this magnifier for checking out old family slides and negatives. It fits nicely over the neg/slide so that I can see all of it in one view. However, it does exhibit considerable pincushion distortion at the sides of the image that you're viewing. Other than that, I really like it for checking old family slides and negs before I scan them into my iMac."
4,Works Fine,Got this to examine slides and negatives to screen for scanning. Works fine. I'd maybe prefer a 5X instead as this almost gets to the grain in B&W negatives.
2,not very useful,It kiind of works but I would rather use a magnifine glass. I have to tilt it to get light in and see what I am doing.
4,I like it,This magnifier was cost effective for me. It worked good for my latent fingerprint class with all those small prints I had to examine and classify.
2,Marginally Acceptable,"I would probably have returned this ""loupe"" (actually a cheap magnifying glass)if shipping hadn't exceeded what I paid for it. I have a true loupe, a 4x Schneider that cost me $80 on eBay. I thought that, for $6, a 10x loupe would be handy for focusing my medium and large format cameras. It didn't work out that way.Only the very center area is in focus, more or less. One's eye has to be back about 5-6 in. from the ""loupe"". This all means that you only see a very tiny area, which makes using it a real pain. Comparing what I see with this thing at 10x and what I can see with my Schneider at 4x, I wonder if it's really 10x.I''m not a happy customer. This is the first crummy thing I've gotten from Adorama, having been a steady customer of theirs for several years. I'm disappointed and saddened."
3,"Not built well, but works great","This a good little loupe, with great magnification and size, but it's not put together very well. The top portion and the lower skirt meet at a slight angle; it's not enough to mar the performance as a loupe, but it's enough to notice and make you feel like it's a very cheap piece of plastic. If you're looking for a cheap loupe that works great, this one's a good pick, but if you want quality keep going."
3,"Fine, but out of focus","Fine lupe, but little bit out of focus. If viewing slides you should press slide little bit inside to get focused. If slide is mounted its almost impossible to get focus."
5,"Nice loupe, good price.","I bought this to replace an 8X Agfaloupe I used to have for slides and negatives. Both are good. At this power some of the negatives edges are cut off, but it's easier to see facial expressions. If you need near full frame go with 8X, more detail 10X or even 15X."
4,it's a negative magnifier,"Lens magnifiers are not complicated, they are glorified magnifying glasses and this one works as well as any other. I like that its clear all the way through. I actually use it for 120 mm negatives which gets annoying because of the frame size but have had no problems with it."
1,contact sheet loupe 10x,It's too small for a contact sheet. It's not suitable for this kind of job. This size is not adpated to work on a 24x36 paper sheet.
1,Defective?,"I just received my magnifier and I either have a defective one or I am not using it properly. I have placed it flat on a table and put a stamp under it to test it out. It's a tiny stamp and yet it doesn't show the whole thing plus, what I can see, is distorted and hurts my eyes. Is it supposed to be like this? I can see far more with my 10x hand held tiny loupe. Guess I need to return this."
2,Too small,Magnifier was bought to view details of photo slides however the view was too small; could only see a tiny portion of slide & then it was distorted.
4,Good for Film Negatives,"I find this loupe to be adequate for viewing negatives and other small objects with fine detail. For the price (under $6 as of this writing) I do not think it could be beaten. However, this is far from a perfect loupe. The clearest magnification is in the direct center and the viewing area inside the eyepiece is fairly small. People with vision difficulties may have problems using this tool as getting the correct balance between distance from the tool and distance from the object is a bit cumbersome.I would recommend this tool to film photographers and anyone else who needs to occasionally use a loupe, but for hobby work (model makers, etc) or professional use (watchmakers, electronics repair) I would suggest looking for a better tool."
4,Works great,"This loupe works very well for artist trying to get the smallest detail in photos for painting. It's a wonderful find for the price, fast shipping. I highly recommend it."
5,Outstanding,The astronomy CD is absolutely outstanding for beginning astronomers. It is fun-filled and full of facts that are related in easy-to-understand ways. I would highly recommend this CD for students from ages 3-15.
3,A good year,"Though this album begins with the funk-essential title track, the finished article should only be a consideration for die hard JB fans. The classic 'talking load and saying nothing' is present in extended form, but can be found on most fairly comprehensive compilations [as with 'king heroin']. 'Greedy man' goes on too long and 'public enemy no 1' far far too long. With the astonishing amount of JB albums released around this period, its not surprising one or two of them are a little inconsistant."
3,Beautiful but confusing,"It is probably not the fault of the author, as he has done good research into the topic. The problem came with the ""sidebars"" that were scattered throughout the book. If they were put at the end of chapters, rather than in the middle of text, it would be much smoother reading."
5,Pure Optimism,"I just read this book and found it very fascinating. I was able to relate as a woman athlete, but can honestly say that I will never understand the kind of difficulties this young woman has faced and continues to overcome on a daily basis. I have always wanted to travel to Alaska and see the Iditarod first hand. Rachael has given me a wonderful insight into the race until my dream is possible. After reading this book you will realize that your limits should be set by yourself and only by yourself. Thanks for your incredible story, and CONGRATULATIONS on your 2006 Iditarod finish!!!"
3,"Excellent, but tainted","I beleive Jordan Rubin's own life experience of overcoming Chrohn's disease alone makes him an authority on the subject. His idea of following a diet much like our hunter gather ancesters makes perfect sense. So much in the book rings true. There is good coverage of so many important topics that explain his reasoning. I'm disappointed there isn't more about Joseph Brasco's experience as a GI doc looking at people's colons--surely that gives one a powerful view of what is happening. The fact that the authors own a supplement company called Garden of Life do create real problems, not only for the credibility, but subtle contridictory advice. He even goes as far as recommending supplements he sells in the book. I highly recommend this book, but be SURE to read others to get a balanced understanding. I suggest The Enzyme Factor, and Why Stomach Acid is Good for You."
4,Excellent,"Very well done book with practical tips for digestion. Another well-done book on these lines is ""Natural Stomach Care"""
1,"Good Sales Pitch, Repetitive Info without Originality","I did not see any originality in the book. The most important part of the book is copied at least in terms of concepts from Elaine Gottschall book 'Breaking the Vicious Cycle'. Quite a bit of it is very generic. There is a also a lot of repetition when it comes to the dietary schedule for different afflictions. And at the end, the sales pitch is too much to accept."
2,Do not buy if you are vegetarian,"I must admit I have not read this entire book but merely glanced through it when it arrived yesterday. However, a common theme throughout is that meat, especially red meat is healthy for you and that some people should be eating 4-5 eggs per day! Also, there is a recipe for a broth that is part of the ""cleansing diet"" everyone must go on for at least 2-3 days. It states that every ingredient is important in this broth and must be included. One ingredient is chicken feet! Really? Chicken feet. Even if I were not vegetarian I would not even know where to buy chicken feet! So if you are not up for eating every part of an animal save your money."
2,a waste of money,"This seemed like a great book in the store, but save your money. It's really just a marketing tool to self-diagnose and buy LOTS of supplements and eat in ways that are impossible for the ordinary person.If you have thousands of dollars of expendable income for supplements and organic foods plus the price of this book, then it's for you. If not, look in other places."
4,Well Worth Reading,"For people who are interested in their Digestive health, this book is very informative. I learned a lot from reading it. On the downside though, although I found this book to be very informative, the author has provided a bunch of links to websites in the back of the book, which are sadly outdated and no longer work. This was very disappointing, but all in all, the book is worth reading."
4,Condition of cover could have been stated better,"I have wanted this book which is clear, concise and perfect for my habitat. I really shouldn't complain since the book was so inexpensive and I love it -- BUT -- when a book is listed as ""--very good"" I don't expect the cover to be bent in the middle (then was straightened out) so it was clearly folded on itself in the middle of the cover nor do I expect it to be dirty. That is the received condition of the book. The cover is coated so that was easy to clean (so easy one wonders why the seller didn't do it). As I said though it is a book I really wondered and at an almost free price."
3,Great selection of recipes,"This cookbook presents a fantastic variety of soups from around the world. Each recipe includes a color photo. Unfortunately, many of the recipes use ingredients that are difficult to find in the U.S. or are unappetizing to me. In particular, there are too many fish soups. If you love seafood soups, you may love this collection, but I was underwhelmed."
4,Adoption explained for boys,My Wife and I are in the process of adopting 2 children.We were seeking something to help prepare our biological children for this new journey.A Sister For Matthew was a perfect book to help our son 6 begin to think about the changes that he will experience.What was great about this book is it shows a vulnerable side with Matthew who really didn't want to adopt but falls in love with his new sister later.I would recommend this for any child but it is especially written for boys..
4,Early Nebraska,Great stories from a good historical author. Sandoz always does a good job telling tales of her childhood growing up in pioneer Nebraska. I think this would be a tastier dish than Ole Jules and served in the right portions. Some overlap with that book.
5,A fantastic journey through the history of publishing,"Alistair McGrath is an incredible writer. This narrative of the history of the King James Bible is a magnificent work of history. Whatever your feelings are about the King James Bible, one cannot deny its prominent place in shaping the language and culture of the Western World.I'm a writer, so it fascinates me to learn how the invention of the printing press led to the revolution of publishing--something we often take for granted when we step into a bookstore and pour over the latest titles. A printed book was such a commodity, such a treasure for the common man, whose education and mind had been held captive by the arrogance and dictatorship of the terrible church-state alliances that plagued the centuries before the Enlightenment and the Reformation.In the Beginning is a fascinating tale of church history, politics, and literature. If you love literature, you'll love this wonderful history."
3,"Interesting, but sloppily edited","I agree with the reviewer who said the book is sloppily edited and strewn with typos and mistakes.My suggestion: get Bobrick's ""Wide as the Waters"" instead. Covers basically the same ground, but does so in much better fashion, in my opinion. The two books were released at about the same time, in the summer of 2001, which naturally invites comparison.If you get a chance to read them both (say, from your local library), I think you too will agree that Bobrick's effort is superior to McGrath's."
5,Excellent review of European History and Printing,"I am not a super religious person, but this book is very well written and has a lot of great historical information. Very informative."
3,"Protestant bias is inevitable, and displayed","I am a Catholic, with a graduate theology degree. I am not finished reading this book, and while I find it very very interesting; McGrath's protestant bias IS evident in the text. For example, whenever speaking of Luther, Zwingli, whoever, their ""beliefs"" are always stated as fact. ""Luther knew that ...."" Whenever a Catholic's position is mentioned, it is always framed as an opinion/belief. ""Because he believed the Pope to be the head of the church."" Etc. It's inevitable I suppose. I hope I can get around the bias, but already just 1/3 of the way through, it is begining to wear on me."
5,In The Beginning,"McGrath's historical explanation of the cultural, political and social events surrounding the perceived need to have another translation is fascinating. A student of history and religion will enjoy understanding the progression from the Geneva Bible with its marginal notes to the King James Version with no notes! The understanding McGrath brings to this work is presented in a clear and easily readable manner. I highly recommend it."
4,In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible,"A very complete historical analysis of the New King James Bible's impact on society, McGrath's work traces the path of the scriptures from their Latin and Greek origins through numerous translations, revealing its historical struggles and triumphs. McGrath has really gone out of his way to help the reader understand the historical context of each step the scriptures went through in their voyage through the centuries. Thorough, yet easy to understand, McGrath's ""In the Beginning..."" is entertaining in presentation and insightful in content."
2,Inaccurate and long winded,"Interesting and easy to read but the inaccuracies leave me questioning the rest of the book. Some of the places where his scholarship is lacking are when he states that Daniel ""and his friends"" were thrown into the lions den. (Daniel was alone) He give the duration of the Babylonian exile as fifty years and not seventy.He also allows personal bias to show through when he refers to the name ""Jehovah"" as a ""term"". He may not like or use the name, but it is a name and not a ""term"".I bought the book because it was supposed to be about the King James Translation and how the language has changed based on that translation. There are a lot of words in this book but not many of them about the effects of the translation on our language."
3,TOO LITTLE HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT,"I love the KJV. But a book about its origins should include the history an difficulties of development of the Hebrew Bible from which it was substantially taken. The translations from ancient Hebrew into Arameic and translation into later Hebrew as well as the translation in Alexandria, Egypt before Jesus's time, into Greek and the reliance upon all sources to develop the Hebrew TANACH as one may find it written today. Such issues as the changing of ""brother"" into ""neighbor"" in the quote by Jesus in the NT."
4,Interesting subject told in a mostly interesting way,"I'm not a Biblical scholar or an authority on the history of the English language although both subjects are of interest to me. This is not a book for those looking to discredit Bible translation as a way to discredit Christian faith. Obviously, the author has a great deal of respect for those that took on this task. However, he doesn't shrink from telling all the ""dirty laundry"" associated with the translation and the acceptance of the KJV. If we think politics and religion get all mixed up today, we only have to read this to find that there is nothing new in the world.All in all, I found this book interesting, easy to read (except for a few places), and enlightening."
1,Not worth the buy,"One would think that with a decent vacuum comes decent accessories. Not in this case! A few cheap plastic parts that fail miserably to the task do a great disfavor to the name. The best piece of the lot, an angular handle that also doubles as a suction adjuster, does not stay connected to the hose due to a manufacturing deffect. The other segments also have a tendency to come apart with annoying regularity. I am sorry to say that this product seems to be an afterthought that skipped the field test altogether. Expect a recall!"
1,Pretty Standard Accessories--Flawed Handle Design,"This is a pretty standard set of accessories one would expect for a shop vac setup. One could argue that they should, at the price of the Fein, be included, but they aren't, so just deal with it. :-)The issue I have is with the design of the handle that is intended to connect the hose to the wands. It comes apart with the slightest downward pressure on the hose. I talked with Fein about it last weekend at the AWFS show in Anaheim, and they committed to get a fix for the problem.Knowing Fein, they'll not only fix it, but fix it well and offer us a free retrofit, but until then, I can't recommend purchasing this set"
2,Unusable in original Kindle format.,"I like this book a lot but will buy it in book form. The Kindle form separates captions from photos (so you can't tell which knot you are looking at). It also retains page number references on the photos -- which is not useful on Kindle. Finally, the formatting separates each step of the directions from the image that illustrates it. You may have a different experience on the larger DX."
2,Pictures out of sequence.,"1) I love this book and it does a great job teaching the most important nautical knots.2) In the Kindle format, the pictures are out of sequence. When converting the book into a Kindle format, did anyone bother to check how they are displayed? It is rather difficult to follow how to tie a knot, when step 1 is followed by step 5. If I did not already know how to tie a bowline, I never would have figured out the picture sequence.3) The book is full of usefull information, so I will not request a refund because of the picture sequences. However, I will expect that a properly formatted Kindle version be provided to me in the near future.4) Did I mention how much I like this book?"
2,why?,"A couple of covers, a couple of originals...it's not bad, but what was the point? Not worth the effort really."
4,worth the read,"I am taking a class on Harlem renaissance literature and this was the first book assigned. It is easy to read and an enlightening story, the background information provided was interesting as well."
2,The ending cannot be justified,"The only thing that holds be back from giving this book a good review is the lunacy of the ending. I don't know what Johnson had in mind, but if he was seeking to create more ambivalence about what is and was a difficult issue when this book was written for many African Americans, he succeeded. I cannot in good conscience encourage anyone to read this, although the prose is truly masterful."
3,"Okay, I guess","This book would have recieved five stars if the narrator had been more likeable. His life story is fascinating and sad, but he is just down right concieted. Another reason I didn't like the narrator is that he didn't seem very reliable. I couldn't be sure that the information he was presenting was accurate (In other words, it was like the wolf's version of ""The Three Little Pigs.""). I could rattle off dozens of reasons why I did not like this character (in the end of the book, the biracial resolved that he would live as a person. However people precieved him, that is what he would be. He ended up living just as a white man.) but that would take days, so I won't."
2,NO,"sorry, i just thought the book was boring and worst of all, its a good story with alot of food for thought, but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined."
4,Excellent study of the meaning of race,"This work is a truly great study of racial identity, showing that the lines of race are drawn more by culture than biology. Highly recommended reading!Oh, and to the latent racist who thought that the narrator was white and that Johnson was jealous of white people: WOW, you really missed the point, didn't you?"
5,A Classic of the Harlem Rennaisance,"Granted, this book perhaps won't appeal to readers whom don't have an appreciation for historic literature, but if you're interested in excellent American literature from the past 100 years, this is a great story. It's lyrical, in my opinion, and full of emotion. This is an uniquely American story. Read parts of it in college and was eager to pick of the e-book and read it in full. Thanks to Amazon for preserving this classic."
2,The autobiography of an ex-colored man,"Very long winded, confusing but enthralling at the same time. I would love to know who this story is actually written about."
2,The Autobiography of An Ex-Colored Man,"This book started out as very interesting, but I became bored with it in the last half. I wouldn't recommend it to others."
4,The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man,"Interesting approach by the author. I think, however, that there was not enough detail, as the author covered a tremendous time frame in a relatively short novel."
5,Highly recommened read!,This was my first kindle book and once I started reading I could not stop. This is a free ebook that was worth every moment. I recommend this book to everyone. This book was very thought provoking and I think anyone can benefit from this story.
2,Gets there,"It was an interesting read. At first it was tough to follow, but about halfway through you really get interested and the reader cannot put the novel down!!"
5,good book,Great Read I think that anyone who gets this book will love reading it and learn a lot from it.
3,Undecided,"This book is a requirement for an African American literature course. It is an easy read and offers an interesting perspective. I am not certain however, that I enjoyed it. This book offers much to be considered. I appreciate that it is work of fiction written by someone who travel led a completely different path."
2,Three is not the charm,"This is the third film in the ""Ginger Trilogy"", featuring Cheri Cafarro as Ginger, ""the female James Bond"". Ginger is once again called upon to offer her body for her country, as she goes up against Ronnie St. Clair, the Anti-Ginger, a woman who similarly has no compunctions about using her sexuality to get what she wants - in this case, kidnapping two diplomats to milk an upcoming trade agreement for lots and lots of money. The Ginger movies would never be made today - these Politically Correct times would never allow it - but this, the last and most expensive of the three, concentrates more on the plot than the gleeful sleazery of the first two films, making it less of a successful Ginger film and more of a failed spy movie. The first two, ""Ginger"" and ""The Abductors"", are better examples of early 70's drive-in sexploitation."
3,The Godfather's first soundtrack recording is hit and miss,"According to JB's front man Fred Wesley, James's attitude towards soundtracks was to simply empty the vaults of unreleased material. Some of these substandard tracks surface on ""Black Caesar"", but fortunately some real classics do, as well. ""Down and Out in New York City"" and ""The Boss"" rank with some of Brown's greatest 70's work. Another major problem is that this album is WAY too short (an insulting 36 minutes). Neophytes to Brown are better off with ""The Payback"" or the ""Make it Funky"" anthology. Harcore fans will find enough to satisfy."
4,A Very Good Soundtrack,"I recently saw this movie on the FLIX cable channel. Buying the soundtrack was an easy choice. I've been buying a lot of James Brown lately. I recommend the compilations ""Motherlode"" and ""In a Jungle Groove"" (both remastered!).There are a lot of excellent JB compilations and remastered albums available. Few of them are bad. The majority are great.This is a great album.It's not real long, but damn it's FUNKY. Enjoy."
4,Some hard to find tracks,"Black Caesar holds some rare funk tracks, including ""The Boss"" which is worth the price of the album itself. Also sports a few action-sequence tracks from the film that are a little cheesy and funny. Overall a good buy."
1,do not recommend this item,"the rubber sheet was broken already, less than two months. I am pretty worried when the wire will be broken as well."
5,A wonderful romantic tale,"Getting What You Want by Kathy Love is a enchanting novel that will touch your heart.Abby Stepp had left Millbrook, Maine behind after her painful high school years. Now she is back in town for a few months to do research at a local lab. Abby wasn't expecting to get all tongue-tied running into the former bad boy Chase Jordan.Chase Jordan had a struggle just to graduate high school and was always in some kind of trouble. Abby Stepp has moved back home, right across the street from Chase. He never really noticed her in school but he sure is now. Chase and Abby agree to an affair but they both find themselves falling for each other. Can they overlook their differences and have a relationship?This novel really touched my heart. We all have those high school memories that still linger long after graduation. Chase and Abby passion explodes off the pages, they are an amazing couple. Kathy Love is now an auto-buy for me."
5,Great Fun!,Wonderfully funny and sexy all at the same time. You can relate to the characters in the whole series. A Must read!
5,Nice addition to the Rider family,"Fundamentally, this is a reprint of your typical Rider-Waite-Smith deck, but it is embellished with gold paint. There have been other reviews criticizing the art work, but I didn't notice the differences enough to complain. I've done a few readings with this deck so far and everything felt right to me.Five stars because I truly have nothing to complain about."
4,Changing Images,"This deck, is quite simply, a reproduction of the Rider-Waite Deck. Repainted in oils, there are small discrepancies between the original deck and the golden rider that any searcher should be able to see. What is most intriguing about this deck is the way the images change-- at least for me. However, like the Rider-Waite Deck, it relies heavily on Christianity symbols and interpretations."
2,Insulting,"I purchased a deck of these cards based somewhat on the reviews here, and also because I am a professional reader and enjoy collecting various renderings of the Rider deck. Basically, I am appalled at the artwork. The paintings seem unprofessional in the extreme, as though painted by an untalented child. For example, the facial expression of The Fool is grotesque to say the least; the lady depicted in The Star seems to have a huge black eye; and the rendering of the IX of Pentacles lady seems quite cartoonish. These pictures are gross from beginning to end. In my opinion they are an affront to the tradition of the Rider deck. I am aghast that U.S. Games should publish them at all. The only reason I gave the deck two stars instead of one is because of the physical quality of the cards. They seem to be of an extremely high quality, thereby making it quite easy to handle and shuffle them. The pictures, however, are so repulsive that I will be handling and shuffling them no more."
1,a joke that isn't funny,"It's not surprising that there is a difference of opinion about this record. I mean if you're going to sell out, you have to sell out to SOMEONE. If everyone recognized it for what it is, there wouldn't be an filthy lucre in it and no point to it.I disagree with one of the reviewers that anything that evokes the sixties in any way is necessarily good (and just because you happened to grow up in the sixties, as did I, doesn't make the sixties inherently wonderful). Hucksterism was as annoying then as it is now, in the naughts. I laughed the first time I heard the title track, but the joke wasn't funny the second time. I don't really think it's a matter of live and let live, each to his own, there's no accounting for taste, etc. No, I think Muzak (and this IS Muzak--with a different brand name) much more insidious, much more oppressive. It squelches art; it smothers sensitivity; it crushes culture."
1,old-school text,"Oi, how much more convoluted can a text get? With every edition, this text gets less organized. Or that is at least true for the last 3 editions, anyways ... Eg. In how many chapters can the topic of ""symmetry"" be covered? Keeping it to 1 would be much easier to digest, thankyou.The text is written in old-school rambly style... sure, it covers all topics, but it is hard to learn from (and in my experience, even harder to teach from). There are better options out there. Nesse ""Intro to Mineralogy"" text."
3,Very cheaply made,"This is the cheapest ratchet ever made. As soon as I used it, the ratcheting gear stripped, and I still have a spark plug to remove, the one and only spark plug on my quad, so I ordered a Stanley 60 piece socket set, which is of high quality.This will be going back for a refund. I would give zero stars, but Amazon gets three for excellent care."
5,Love it,"I have had this tape for over 10 years and although I don't use it all the time, I always go back to it. Sure, it can be a little repetitive, but if you just listen to the music (which I love and is NOT outdated - it's classic) and just let your body move it will be worth all the while. I am an excercise buff, I am in good shape, and after 10 years, I still have sweat pouring off of me after I complete this workout. This review is just for the Hot Dance segment. I was not too crazy about the bands. Oh yeah, another reviewer mentioned what Cher was wearing. Who cares!! That is just Cher. She has ALWAYS been like that and always will be. More power to her!"
2,"Not as good as Cher's ""A New Attitude""","If you loved Cher's ""A New Attitude,"" you may want to rent this video before you buy it. Although her ""hot dance"" section was fun, it was very dated and quickly became too repetitious. The second section uses giant rubberbands, which I didn't have. It did look like the second section was great for toning, but you need the rubberband. I'd rate this video as a two."
1,Is this a joke?,"I checked this out of our library before buying it - what IS this video, a joke? She spends 10 minutes talking first - HUGE hair (...) - then shows up to the ""class"" in some outfit that looks like she's ready for her Playboy pictorial (Please, Cher, most of us are here to exercise, we really don't need to see your newly waxed bikini line!) and the so-called ""exercise"" is tapping your feet to the rhythm of watered-down (elevator-ized) rock music. NOT for anyone who actually wanted to sweat or get their hair mussed....I'm wondering who the target audience was for this video..."
4,House of Exile Great History,"A friend loaned this to me after I raved about ""WildSwans"", which I got from Amazon auction. The style is not warmlybiographical, but the author gives an amazing picture of life in China from 1927 to 1933. I too would love to know what happened to her and her family. Anyone who enjoyed this should certainly read ""Wild Swans"" by Jung Chang. Both contain information about China which was a complete revelation for me."
2,"Weak, But Slightly Useful","I bought Learning Cocoa because I assumed, being written by Apple and published by O'Reilly, that it had to be good. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed.The book begins with a fairly weak introduction to Objective-C and Cocoa, and then launches into telling you what lines to pound in to Project Builder and what buttons to click in Interface Builder in order to compile programs that Apple has written. While these ""tutorials"" provide no real room for guided independent development, they do have some worth for learning good Cocoa development procedures and for getting in to the habit of writing Cocoa code.All in all, Learning Cocoa didn't advance my knowledge very far, and I don't see myself counting on it as a reference at any point in the future. I'd stay away from this one unless you're a Cocoa book collector or something odd like that."
2,Nothing new here...,"Basically a rehash of the documentation that is available on the OS X Developer CD and Apple's web site. Frankly, I think it's shameful that Apple is, on the one hand, chastising developers for not embracing X, while, on the other, failing to document the X development environment. Learning Cocoa covers just the basics while leaving the most intriguing and potentially useful aspects of the environment unexplained. That shouldn't be a surprise, I suppose, since the most popular phrase in the current collection of developer documentation is ""Description forthcoming."" Sheesh."
4,A good collection of information all in one place,"This book will give you a great introduction to Cocoa but don't expect to walk away with a mastery of the topic. The folks at Apple have taken their many on-line examples and documentaiton and essentially wrapped it in a pretty and more edited format (less errors than on-line version).There's almost nothing in this book that you can not find on-line, but this book does a great job at organizing. I was a bit bummed that the high quality found in other O'Reilley books was not present here, but in general I like the idea of collaboration between Apple and O'Reilley. In another time, in another place this book would have been the standard documentation that came along with the Developer Tools but in this age when we download everything maybe that can't be expected.In bottom line, this is a well edited, well put together book. It will teach you Project Builder and many aspects of developing with Cocoa. However, it's only an introduction."
3,"Useful, I suppose","The Interface Builder (which helps assemble the GUI for a Cocoa application) has changed a bit since this book was written. The palettes have been rearranged, and some of the interface elements are different. For example, the book directs one to click on the ""electrical outlet"" icon next to the class name. There is no longer such an icon in current versions of IB. Fortunately in all cases where the book no longer matches the tools it has been fairly easy to figure out what to do.Learning Cocoa is still usable, but is becoming dated."
2,Bad Dog!,"Dull, dull, dull. Quite literally this is a bunch of documentation you can download from Apple's site bound in a book. Yes, you do learn something, but the ratio of useful information to ""type in the program"" is awful and it's very dry reading.Try the Aaron Hillegass book, or the new O'Reilly ""Building Cocoa Applications"" if you want a useful title on programming Cocoa. I see there's a second edition of this book due in September 2002 - hopefully this'll either pep up the existing content, or add something more (published paper documentation for the Cocoa frameworks is non-existent, probably because some of the on-line documentation I've looked at still has big gaping holes in it - and people wonder why Carbonized apps outnumber those that use Cocoa...)"
1,Poor construction & minimal content,"This is the only computer book I have ever purchased whose pages began to fall out within hours of its arrival. As for the content, it offers very little that is not covered in much greater detail in the Apple documentation provided free with Dev Tools. This is most likely the last O'Reilly book I will ever purchase!"
2,Not a good buy,Its appearance is too bad. Its material is bad. Its not at all professional and bulky too. I didnt like it.
5,Excelente Bolso,Caracteristicas que lo hacen excelente:- Espacioso.- Ligero- Protege el laptop- Duradero.Tal y como siempre se han categorizado los productos de TARGUS.EXCELENTE
5,Husband and Tween Proof,"My husband purchased this backpack for his work laptop and used it for over a year. Once he upgraded to a different computer, he got a new bag and passed this one on to our 11-year-old son. He then used it for 5th and 6th grade. My little guy can be rough on school supplies. We've yet to find a expandable binder that will last more than four months. They tend to some home in pieces.After two years this laptop bag has barely a scratch on it. The zippers are in working order, nothing is fraying. It is standing up well to my destructive son. Well worth the money paid for it. I anticipate it to last another year at least and beyond."
3,"Good backpack, but don't be too rough with it!","I have used this backpack for a year, and for that year it was great. Cavernous space, and a place for a large laptop, but about 9 months in, the main zipper would came off the track repeatedly and it got to the point that the track detached itself from not only the zipper, but from the backpack too! so the main compartment couldn't even close. This exact same thing happened to the front zipper too! Good backpack, but don't expect it to last a long time."
4,After at least 2-3 years of daily use..,"I ride a motorcycle almost every day... 14-15k/miles a year. About 75% of the time, I have this backpack. It doesn't cramp, doesn't swing around, and holds a LOT. I do, however, have a couple of complaints:There are extra 'compression' buckles to make the backpack seem smaller. However, they're useless and flap around when you're going 70mph. I folded them inside the bag. There is also a waist strap that is too much of a pain. I folded it up and stuck the excess into side pockets (you don't even notice it).. you know, I might as well cut them off.It has 3 main pockets. I'd prefer the small 'laptop' pocket left alone (room for a laptop or a little more) and the other two combined into one huge pocket."
4,4+ For the Matrix Notebook,"Bought it with the HP zv6100 series. Has plenty of storage for pretty much everything. The only negative thing I can say about the pack is that with a 15.4"" laptop it is a very tight fit. The velcro closure strap securing the laptop in place should be about an inch longer for better fitment. Otherwise it rests nice on your back and its very adjustable."
4,a lot of space,"It is a very nice backpack there is a lot of space there; three(+) compartment, all your papers, your laptop and lunch can be there without touching each other. Two things that I do not like and do not make this backpak the perfect one for me. 1. I would prefer to have a water bottle holder instead of one of the pocket on the side(specially in Florida), using the backpack I saw that I needed it. 2. The front pocket is big enough to put anything in it but it is kind of separate from the backpack so it is always a problem to take it from the lockers because it always get stuck and you have to be very careful to no damage it.Overall this is a very nice backpack."
2,Targus Notebook review,"I'm kind of disappointed, the seams are coming apart at the zipper. I'm buying a new backpack, but not a Targus."
2,Too big,This bag was too big. I needed a bag to transport my laptop to work and this was way too big for me. Maybe a college kid might like it more.
3,Quite good,"The bag is really good, but the color is not so good for me. I prefer the color that is more bright, but for this bag, it is too dark for young guys. I believe targus pay little on the appearance of their products. Anyway, the bag is really good for students, I can put my computer, books and lunch, anything esle in it. It is really large."
4,Laptop Back Pack for Big Bellys,"So far so good. I use if for business travel, mostly overnight and back trips. The compartmentalization is well thought-out. I am able to pack an extra shirt and slacks as well as my personal items without difficulty. Really helps speed through the security lines.I like having the computer storage area in the inner most compartment (against my back) instead of in one of the outermost compartments like some of competitive products. Overall, it is a good product for the price."
4,It's okay,I have been using this bag for a few years now while going to school. I carry a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop in it and it fits fine. One of the main pocket zippers separates sometimes (happened about 5 times in two years). Would be nice if there was a pocket to carry a water bottle.
4,Targus Laptop Backpack,Good product. Could be better organized. The pockets need more closures or zippers.
2,Not worth 60 bucks,"Good things about this backpack:1. Plenty of pockets.2. laptop protection is excellent as far as any drops or pressure. There are problems, though...3. not awkward, standard feeling backpack.Cons:1. Not at all waterproof. I can't emphasize this enough, it doesn't keep water out at all.2. Many of the pockets are weirdly sized, shaped and useless.3. Main pocket has a strange cheap inner flap and I can't figure out the purpose of it.This backpack is worth 30 or 40 dollars maybe."
2,Too bulky,"Though this backpack has ample room for what I needed to put in it, it's construction is stiff and it is huge, no matter how much stuff you have in it - it's like carrying a small child wherever you go. Also, the zippers are not the best quality - one is already totally broken and another on its way after only one year. The only plus is the separate laptop compartment - that is handy as I have a relatively large computer."
1,Rebate problems,"It is a nice product, but don't assume you will get the rebate without having to submit all your information more than once. If you use the rebate in calculating the cost, you are apt to be disappointed."
5,Great backpack!,"I've had one of these for several years, and we just bought a second one. It is very durable and the layout is very convenient. There are lots of compartments and pockets for easy organization."
5,Book Bag,"My daughter was due for a new book bag for high school, we went on line and this was the best bang for our buck and it has a lifetime warranty. When it arrived we were ecstatic at the quality and the way the bag was built. It has more than enough room for all the things she carries too and from school."
3,A good read while on board,I read this book while on a multi day fishing trip in my small boat. It was a fun read and I enjoyed it. The reason I only gave it 3 stars was that the author struck me as kind of a mooch.
4,""" LOTS 'O' FUN ""","I'm not a sailor nor intend to be after reading this wonderful adventure book but, I love adventure stories especially true ones where someone goes off on their own and let's nature do what she will.This book had me laughing out loud as I think our boy here bit off more then he could chew at the start . seemed like a good idea at the time I suppose : ) altho he did manage to become learned about the nautical jargon thru trial and error . buy it, borrow it ...have a laugh ."
3,Regular edition is best,"The Windows 98 Unleashed version is better than the Windows 98 Unleashed: Professional Reference Edition version, for the lack of a couple hundred extra pages of extraneous unnecessary material. With the standard version it's easier to find what you need."
2,"Limited detail, no LAN/Fax info","Limited detail, not much more than Win98 Help files provide. for example: No info on setting up fax server under Win98 Peer to Peer. Very limited trouble shooting guide. Mostly for Windows NT."
5,Dead On,"If you are a a fan of Bill Hicks, then this is probably the best piece of postmortem merchandise out there. Somehow, it just feels right, and though a few of the rants are not the greatest, most of them are dead on and perfect.I can't think of any reason not to own this."
2,A missed opportunity,"A great shame- what could have been a showcase for a wide range of Bill Hicks fans, established and new comics and political satire becomes too close to being an ego trip for half a dozen of the organsiers buddies. Were there really so few contributions to this project that the same names had to be used again and again?There are some good pieces but too few- and far too few Brits for someone who was so popular in the UK and such an Anglophile (and, unusually for an American capable of accurately satirising the British)."
2,DIdn't read the description very well,This is a collection of other people ranting Bill Hicks-style. That's my fault for not reading the description better! I am actually now trying to resell it!
2,Eh... Not so good.,"This is a very wordy book for a topic that should probably have a more reference style coverage. It focuses a little bit on how to use the matching functions in .net, and a little bit on how to use regular expressions.The .net stuff is really easy to get on your own, and the regular expressions stuff is so glossy that its not that useful.I don't like having this book on my shelf since I can never find anything useful at a glance, but its not worth anything to sell. Maybe I'll burn it."
4,"Excellent in covering the subject, could be a little more coherenet","This is a great book. Period. Regular Expressions is a chaotic subject to start, I couldn't find usefull help on MSDN. This book does a great job bridging the gap. I'm still a novice in Regular Expressions (it's too spagetti-ish for a business software developer), but this book helped me implement whatever lightweight logic I needed.Then why 4 stars, you probably ask. Because I found it to be a little incoherent to pass the 5 star benchmark. The author is a little too all-over-the-place-ish. But it was well worth the money spent."
2,Note,This book was sold by Wrox to APress. The code download is available directly from APress at http://support.apress.com.
4,I love the book.,....just wanted to tell the authors that your efforts are appreciated... I love the book. I'm confident that more people will rediscover the work of Brigitte Helm with this unique book.
2,not current,"WRITTEN IN 2004 NOT CURRENT THOUGHT IT WAS PUBLISHED RECENTLY, WISH I WOULD KNOW IT BEFORE I BOUGHT THE BOOK.BOOK IS IN GOOD CONDITION"
5,AMA Family Medical Guide,This is my third updated purchase of this book. I have the 2 privious versions too. Much more updated information available making it a requirement for anyone who was misdiagnosed in the past. Previously helped family members to get a second opion.
4,Cmparison with the Old,We bought this edition to see if it could replace our 1887 edition. Found that the symptoms charts in the 1987 version were easier to use. So we will keep both of them.
2,Better Books are Available,The Mayo Clinic Family Health Book is a much more informative and detailed book. It is a much better value.
4,"American Medical Association Family Medical Guide, 4th Edition",This gives the precise information we were looking forward to having at our finger tips. Good to have this type of informational book!
5,Comprehensive Book,This book is the exact kind of medical guide which I like to refer too. It is user friendly. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants quick facts about illnesses'.
4,used a lot,I bought this book for one of our church memebers and she loves it...it has all the needed information in simple language
2,Inaccurate,"Inaccurate regarding ME/CFIDS (""CFS""). It is nice to see ME appropriately classified under autoimmune disorders. There were some glaring inaccuracies though, like saying that ME is a variety of different symptoms in different people; that tests can't aid in diagnosis and that most people recover."
5,great read,all information I was looking for was there...highly recommended...don't hesitate to buy this book if you are looking for medical info
3,Information in one place,Had previous edition and this one updates quite a few items. Is still behind the times in latest findings and recommendations
5,Perfect!,"This is my favourite one! She's really sexy with all her song inside...Great performed and amazing composed (Lenny Kravitz is da' best!) in every track. ""Be My Baby"" was so popular in Jakarta (1992) and it become hits at that time! I bought the record at Jogjakarta when I was in my holiday (1992). But now, it's hard to find this CD again after past 12 years..Anyone can help me to get this?"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I failed my first attempt at the Access Exam by 2 points. I was looking for a book to quickly review some things I may not know. This book is not only boring to read but confusing. I spend more than half of the time looking for the examples supplied on the diskette of practice files. Some I never found, I just gave up and looked around my access database for something similar. The practice test in the back has no way of scoring you. You have to know what you did or did not know when you are finished, then review. Pass on this book."
3,MOUS Access 97 Exam Cram,"The book was fairly comprehensive and covered 99% of what was on the test. However, you should not rely upon this book to get you through the exam. You should have an excellent working knowledge of Access before attempting the exam, and use this book simply as a review."
4,Don't buy the Nonsuch Edition,"Like all of the Barsetshire novels, The Small House at Allington is a delight to read.Less delightful is the Nonsuch Classics edition. This is the second Nonsuch title I have read, and both have been absolutely riddled with typos. I am not exaggerating when I write that there is some error (a strangely placed comma or an odd word substitution [""me"" for ""he"" or ""my"" for ""by""]) on virtually every page. It's very distracting and aggravating.I would recommend the book very highly, but would strongly advise any reader to seek out another edition."
5,A Modern Thoreau,"It is rare to find a 21st century man as aware of his natural environment as Bill Belleville. In a world of turnpikes, shopping malls, gasoline emissions, the shriek of airplanes, the thunder of traffic and the relentless river of asphault that paves over memories and dreams, it is refreshing to find an author who longs to simplify, who notices apples snails and gopher tortoises, who endorses a way of life that has virtually vanished and writes lovingly of a place on earth and a watery path that modern society has all but forgotten."
4,Comfort on Car trips,"While not a revolutionary idea, the shape and design of this product are marvelous for those with lumbar support needs. My acunpuncturist provided me with my Huggar. The packaging also says it is helpful for those with upper back pain, esp between the shoulder blades - when used at home, supine for a 15 minute stretch session. I highly recommend this product."
5,my husbands' birthday,I didn't understand who Mike and TJ was or why my husband (who is a serious hunter) would think that they were so funny. I ordered 2 of their videos for his birthday and I sat and watched them both with him. Now I'm going to order some more for fathers day. They are hilarious! True rednecks. I know people like this (that's really sad). The videos were great they arrived just like promised and I'm very satisfied w/my purchase.
5,Judy Garland's BEST PERFORMANCE EVER!!!,"Judy Garland was robbed of the Best Actress Award for 1954, it went to Grace Kelly who can't act. Judy stars as Esther Blodget, a wannabe star who is traveling with her band until she meets up with Norman Maine, James Mason. They don't exactly fall in love at first sight, but he ends up growing on her. Then, one tragedyafter another happens to them until one of them dosen't make it out alive. A brilliant film that everyone should see. Features magnificent songs like, ""The man that got away"". Enjoy!!!6 ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS:[1954] BEST ACTRESS-JUDY GARLANDBEST ACTOR-JAMES MASONBEST ART DIRECTION/SET DECORATION[COLOR]BEST SCORE FROM A MUSICAL PICTUREBEST COSTUME DESIGN [COLOR]BEST SONG ""THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY"""
4,The original does exist...,"I recently read a great article that talks about this film. Four complete prints do exist, but the collectors are not willing to let WB have them because they don't want to compensate the collectors, claiming it is their product. So, until these disputes are settled we are left with this version, still glorious, but still a mere shadow of the complete original."
4,What about James?,"Judy,Judy,Judy!That's all I see in reviews,but man did anyone notice James Mason?What a great actor.His performance is sublime.It seems that some of you got it,if not...watch it again and pay close attention to Mason.Absolutely brilliant!His courtroom scene moved me to tears.Saying little more than a few words,you could feel his shame and hopelessness just by looking at him.Even when he's crying in bed,you see the despair in every tear.Yep,God Bless James Mason,he has never let me down.I can always count on him for first rate entertainment.Go on and give him another shot,you won't be disappointed."
3,A Star is Born,Love Judy Garland. Have seen many of her movies plus the broadway show. Such a tragic life but she left behind many memories.
3,Boring,I should've watched the Barbara version instead. Didn't care too much for the music in this one. and its 3 hrs long!!
4,A True Classic,"This film is a must for the film buff--a great story about the old Hollywood system. The rise of one star and the decline of another. Beautifully photographed and above all beautifully acted. Jack Carson plays the role of the heartless studio publicist to perfection. One complaint though. I respect the roles that film historians play in this business. They're important figures in the field of film preservation. But come on--using photographic stills over audio right in the middle of the movie is just not cool. ""A Star Is Born"" was shortened for a reason--those scenes which were deleted from the film were not that important. That could've been saved for the special features."
5,"A star was born in June 10, 1922!","That star was the one and only Ms Judy Garland. what can we say about this master piece that hasnt been said already? This is THE BEST MUSICAL AND DRAMA ever!!!!! Judy Garland does it all in this one. She makes us laugh, cry, smile, she puts on amazing musical numbers, she dances sooooo well, her vocals I mean we all know she had the best voice ever heard to this day, she is a complete performer, a true artist. THIS IS A MUST SEE AND HAVE not only for her fans but for movie lovers period. PLUS THE blu ray version is the best version you could buy. The booklet is so beautiful and the extras a legacy. Don't think about it just buy it! Judy Garland thank you for all your legacy. I was born 63 years after you did but I love you and admire you beyond words."
2,A Star is Born Fails to Capture Audience's Sympathy,"A Star Is Born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons. By failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star's tragic downfall, the film displays a schizophrenic quality. There is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen. This is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors; it's the nature of the material itself. Perhaps if we were to see the James Mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living, the audience would understand what the Garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters. Instead, we see Garland's character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and we're left feeling as empty as the film itself."
2,Wonderful Production but 1937 Version Was BEST,"Judy Garland's singing and dancing & George Cukor's directing saved this film from being a total flop. James Mason was horribly miscast as Norman Maine as were almost all the other characters. In defense of Mr. Mason who was an outstanding actor, noone could replace Fredric March as Norman Maine. This DVD has about 55 minutes of Premire Footage outside the Pantages Theater in 1954 with interviews with attendees like Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero, George Jessel. This alone is worth the price of the DVD."
2,Most Annoying!,"I found this DVD release of A STAR IS BORN impossible to watch. The all-too-frequent use of stills over a sound track was extremely annoying. I praise the attempt to recreate Cukor's original concept...but I do not praise the results. I would much rather have seen two versions on the DVD, one with the poor stills-and-dialogue recreation of what was hacked out, and one that's at least watchable. I have to confess that I didn't make it through the entire movie. I couldn't! It was too annoying. I think they should have waited until somebody somewhere can locate missing footage. (However, it's still better than the Streisand/Kristofferson abortion!)"
2,Quit all the singing!,"I got this at the library, because we wanted to see how it compared to the 1937 version with Fredric March. Well, we didn't think much of this movie. First of all, there was too much singing. I don't mind singing in some movies if it is good ( as in The Sound of Music, Elvis' King Creole and Jailhouse Rock, etc.), but I do not care for Judy Garland's singing. Secondly, I felt Judy was too old for the part. I think she would have been much better in her younger days when she was fresh and beautiful. Thirdly, I didn't see much chemistry between Judy and James Mason. I still feel the 1937 version is best; while I like James Mason (and he is the reason I give this film 2 stars), I felt Fredric March was much better in the Norman Maine role. I was a bit bored throught the viewing and was glad when it was over and it is a film I will never watch again."
5,"Garland's musical genius makes ""Star"" special","Recently I saw a 2 hour documentary on the musical lyricist, Johnny Mercer and it was noted in it that Mercer had an affair with a very young 19 yr old starlet by the name of Judy Garland. However Mercer's wife heard about it and confronted Ms Garland and read her the riot act--thus for as long as he lived, Mercer's feelings for Garland never changed. In fact the song, ""I Remember You"", is his love poem to Judy. After seeing this film several times, one can why. Though I do like the 1937 version with Janet Gaynor and Frederic March, this one is special because of Garland's musical genius. And the songs, everyone tailor made for her talents such as ""The Man That Got Away"", ""Born in a Trunk"", etc. Also outside of Judy, James Mason delivers an iconic performance as the doomed Norman Maine. So if you have to pick between the '37 version or this one--choose this for Garland and by the way, forget about the terrible 1976 Streisand version."
5,Judy Garland is literally A Star is Born,I had watched this movie on TCM. I liked it and love it even more now. Judy has such a voice...that leaves me speechless and without words to describe it. She is great in this movie. It is such a great cast. I don't know what more to say
2,A rip off is born,"Ok suckered in. This is one of the great movies of our time and this is a nice new fresh print, but no better or worse than the last DVD print of the film. Deluxe what? Special why? Very very little here that was not on the previous DVD release, just a few different angles and yet another couple of dress versions of ""Man that Got Away"". Totally unnecessary if you have the original DVD version. I believe there is complete versions of the film floating about,will we ever see them?"
3,A Star is Born,"I read all the reviews listed prior to purchasing and I didn't read anywhere that reconstruction actually meant that they put black and white still pictures in the place of the missing moving picture sequences. At one point I felt like I was watching a slideshow presentation with music and sound! I had no idea the movie would be so choppy and for that I'm deeply disappointed.I don't feel like it was worth the price and I probably won't ever watch it again. Too bad too, because what I did see of the performance was good. Unfortunately, I felt like I only got 3/4 of the movie and the rest was fill in the blanks."
3,The Star That Got Away,"While Judy deserved an Oscar compared to wooden-winner Grace Kelly and how she lost is a mystery (backstabbing friends like that, who needs?), this movie has no sense of modesty, moderation or restraint. Everything is done to excess: Judy's decible-registering concert hall bellowing can be off-putting; Cukor's plodding direction, amateur edits and often garish coloring are curiously over-rated. Her character seems to have a personality disorder, abruptly changing moods and appearances with every jarring edit. Also, the movie is too long, explaining the need for cuts: one inexcusable cut however was ""Lose That Long Face"". On cue her character snaps out of her tears and switches on like a mega-watt light bulb to film a happy musical production number. Closest we will ever come to seeing the real Judy Garland and melding the on-screen, MGM sunny persona with the off-screen, tormented star."
3,Restored? Still photos in black and white? That's a movie?,"""A Star is Born"" is still one of my favorite films. But do we really need restored scenes with lines like ""stop the car here a minute"" that aren't all that important to the main plot which is already long enough? If these are restored scenes, make them filmed scenes instead of black and white photos. Be warned that ""Lost Horizon"" is restored like this, too. I do feel the shortened version kept the plot from flowing into all sorts of strange tangents, like the tropical fruit song filmed for a TV commercial and the feuds of alcoholic Norman Maines(Mason) with guards, police, etc. Jack Warner himself signed a contract for a script under 125 pages, with an option to edit out unneeded parts ""as junk."" This restored version is altering history Orwell-style. At least make the short version available for viewers to compare."
2,Okay but not great!,"I like Judy Garland as both an actress and a singer but this was definitely not one of her best movies, Judy did do a good job with her performance and James Mason did do a good job with his portrayal of the alcoholic husband but the movie in general was uneven and flawed despite their talent."
4,Good Axapta Book,"It is nice to see some books on Axapta finally coming out. This is a solid book with alot of information on Axapta. I would classify this book as a detailed overview of Axapta directed mostly at system administrators, developers and Axapta consultants. It is a great starting point if you are new to Axapta.Although the authors in the intro state end users can use this book most of the material is going to be a little deep for them. The chapters on end user functionality are okay but limited. But alot of ground is covered in a relatively concise manner. Good job. I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked to seem more information on application class and table structures of Axapta."
2,Just an overview,"Well, any dax related book is welcomed since we don't have many.It's not that the books is bad for its purpose, but like the other negative reviewers say, it's just a general overview book that is not enough to scrape the surface of it and that is the truth. Someone should come up with sceries of books that concentrate on a module at a time.So, if you are expecting too much and in a situation of doing dirty practical hands-on stuffs...working with MorphX and X++ through the maze of classes, data dics, forms, etc, you shouldn't expect too much from it."
3,Dynamics AX guide,"I would say it is a bit lightweight, but as a complete beginner I have found it a lot easier than wading through the mountains of stuff availble from Microsoft."
2,Axapta international projet manager,Book is covering the subjects on a too technical elvel and not easy to understand for an Axapta customer.
1,Axapta senior consultant,The book should have some checklists to help customer and consultants. It sohuld underline important considerations. It sohudl be more than an Axapta help menu.
1,Not Interesting,"This book strives to make a young person interested in their faith. However it is completely saturated with higher criticism. It does not strengthen a persons faith but rather it brings doubts. Infact throughout the entire book they seem to remind you that our faith is based on nothing but a book, a book that may be fatally flawed.Of course if you like that stuff this is the book for you!"
1,Planting seeds of doubt,"I bought this because my son's Catholic religion teacher is still using it suplementally, and I wanted to check it out. I question whether the author is really Catholic. It is texts such as this that lead students away from truth. I would recommend the Didache series developed by Scott Hahn."
5,Taylor Caldwell delivers her customary high quality,"Caldwell sets this novel in 17th century France, when the persecutions of the French Protestant Huguenots is about to resume after a hiatus of tolerance. She offers her usual vivid portraits of characters, especially the wily Cardinal Richelieu, and a vivid depiction of the bitterness of the poverty of Paris peasants. The novel culminates in the dreadful siege of Rochelle, which led to the Huguenots' mass exodus to the New World, where they founded New Rochelle. Caldwell's usual flaws are evident here--why is everone so ""inexorable,"" so bitter, so alientated, so all-or-nothing in their approach? Still, this novel is a highly entertaining account of this turbulent period in French history, and Caldwell's many fans won't be disappointed."
2,I did not understand the codes.,Book looked like hundreds of people had just read it. I haven't read it yet. Because to small print-worn etc.Of course Taylor Caldwell will not disappoint me.
5,A bright multicultural selection,"With tales such as The Blue Mountains, The Cat and the Mouse in Partnership, The Dragon and His Grandmother, Fairer-than-a-Fairy, The Flower Queen's Daughter, The Glass Axe, How To Tell a True Princess, and many others how can anyone not find this book fun to read? Once again, Lang edits a book full of fairy tales from many lands that will entertain children and adults. The black and white illustrations are also superb."
2,No Pictures or table of contents,"This edition is very incomplete. I should have done more research and found a better publisher. There is no picture or table of contents, just jumps right into the stories without intro or explanation. I wouldn't mind that if there were at least a table of contents to direct my use of the book. I also haven't started reading the stories to my kids just yet, but the idea is that this is a collection of classics, so I am eager to dive in soon."
2,What?,"My biggest problem with this book is there is no table of contents. Every time I look for a particular story, I have to look through the entire volume, which contains maybe forty fairy tales, maybe more. I just can't fathom how any publisher would have thought this incomplete volume would be a good idea."
3,The Yellow Fairy Book,"As much as I was looking forward to this book it disappointed in many ways, it seems stale in today's fantasy literature. Yet some tales are more than worth the time spent to go through the book."
5,One Hell of a video! GREAT GREAT BUY!,This is a great video! Pandora was HOT in the video. Plus its at a Great Great Price! You would be crazy not to buy this video! YOU WOULD LOVE IT!
2,Could have been a lot better...,"I love Pandora Peaks as a person, and I can't get enough of her body, but this movie left me disappointed. I know that this is an artistic project for her...whatever, but you get plenty of repeat footage, and sometimes you end up with better views of the camera crew than you do Pandora herself. I liked the discussions with her, and the one redeeming thing about this film was that Pandora seems like a really nice, down-to-earth lady. If I was to add anything to this show it would be better continuity...and more material of her in the swimming-pool. Pandora should fire her director and get someone else for any new projects in the future.In conclusion, if I wasn't already a Pandora fan I'd be extremely saddened. I'd recommend Playboy's Voluptuous Vixens II in lieu of this for anyone who wants to see better footage of Pandora."
4,OH MAN IS PANDORA HOT!!!!!!,"Not only does Pandora have a nice set of monster melons, but she also has a real nice big ...!!! Sometimes you see these giant breasted types have ... but no body or no face leaving you with just an ugly bag with big .... But in this video, you will witness the HOT and SIZZLING Pandora Peaks. You will experience outrageous stunts mostly topless, in bikinis, or totally naked. My only complaint is i personally can do without the annoying dialogue, the euro-trash/disco music, and the semi-boring photo shoots. It would be fun and successful i think to see Pandora in a video that concentrates only on her being TOTALLY naked in public. Overall, great video, very well done."
5,I've never seen anything like this in my life!,If you like Pin-up and big breast this is the video for you! I thought it was very well done and Pandora looks really hott! The Director is this young kid who has no fear in taking chances in displaying Pandora in broad daylight of rush hours of Los Angeles totally nude! The video has good music and plenty of up close and personal nude stuff with Pandora Peaks. It's just really diffrent and something anyone would get a rise out of! As a woman I felt it was very artistic and well done and classy. It is a must have in any video collection.
2,Very simple book - reads as like an instruction manual,"The book's title is ""Palm Pilot in 10 Minutes"" and this is true. The book focuses on the basics.It is good for what it is, an intro to the Palm Pilot.Good book to have around for beginners who are not technically inclined.I literally read the book in 10 minutes and then gave it to a colleague.The book does not go into applied implementations for corporate sales teams and or executive staff. (No coverage on Notes, Exchange, Goldmine, Outlook, ...)"
4,Thank Satan!,"The demons of power metal return again! For fans of Running Wild, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Helloween etc. I do kinda wish though, that Kai would do more songs on vocals although he really is more of a guest."
5,Excellent,"This is a great album that any Metal fan (especially Power Metal) should own. This is the first Iron Savior album I have listened to, and I will definitely be getting more in the future. ""Never Say Die"", ""Dragons Rising"", and ""Made of Metal"" are especially noteworthy tracks. Iron Savior, I salute you \nn/ >_<"
2,"Same old, Same old....","This is the 4th Iron Savior album that I have and it will be that last. Iron Savior started out with a couple of strong albums but then the cracks started to appear.Dark Assault is just like each of their preceeding discs. The band has not progressed at all. The music is well done technically, but cold and uninviting.The greatest flaw; however, is the drum-work (Thomen Stauch). The same beat over and over and over--this wouldn't be so bad except that it crosses over into their earlier albums making each album sound largely identical. It's so bad that after a couple of listens, it's difficult to not believe that Iron Savior is using a drum-machineExtremely poor drum-work seems to be a staple of many recent power metal bands, and Iron Savior, sadly, is no exception. Maybe they should hire Sir K Luttinen (The Black League) for an example of how to make the skins sound like an additional instrument instead of just the mindless banging put out by Stauch."
2,"I liked Iron Savior, but this....","Iron Savior started with a great concept, building a story through their music across 3 CDs... but now the story is now long dead. I hoped that they would have started with a new one for this CD, but they're just dragging it on and on and on... This CD has some pretty amazing gutar work, but its just not enough to save the CD from its almost annoying lyrics and killed off concept.If Iron Savior rises again with a new story, I will be the first in line to buy it, but this CD, you can do without."
4,Great read,"This was a great read. It is my fourth Martin book. My first was Annopolis, which I found to be reveting. My second was Citizen Washington and then, (back to back) Back Bay and Cape Cod. Martin's fiction equals that of Jackes and Michener. I just retured from a visit to the Boston area; unfortunately, I didn't visit Cape Cod. After reading this book, I want to go back!"
4,Cape Code,I like the historical parts of this piece of fiction. There is enough mention of real historical figures to help make it believable. Very good book!
5,Cpae Cod,"Loved it,loved it,loved it. I know thw Cape and it was definately a wonderful read. I can't wait to get ""Back Bay""."
2,I just can't get into it,"I've had to force myself to read halfway through this book. The pilgrim chapters are the most interesting, but overall, it's just boring."
1,Disappointing,This book is banal. I was hoping for more sophisticated analysis. This is an area of California history that deserves better than this effort.
1,Sloppy & boring; very disappointing.,"It's a real slog trying to get through this badly written, repetitive, and seemingly pointless work. With the fascinating real-life stories he had to work with, it's a wonder the author could produce such a dull book. It reads like a very rough first draft; very unprofessional."
1,Don't Buy!,"I'm a college student, got this bed for my first apartment and it is super modern and cool and I thought it was nice I wouldn't have to buy a box spring but I quickly learned my lesson! It is really comfortable but it broke within about 3 months and is basically unfixable (my boyfriend has tried everything!). If you don't believe me, check similar beds' reviews! All the same!"
2,awful squeaking,"yes this is cheap but that's for a reason. the slats are weak and my husband snapped one while assembling it. and worst of all, it is increadibly squeaky, and is getting worse."
4,Romantic and entertaining,"My guilty pleasure is romance novels and Alexis Harrington definitely fits the bill with Montana Born and Bred. Historical romance is my favorite so this was the perfect read for me on my Kindle while on vacation. This is not high brow literature but if you want a little escape, a little fun and a lot of romance - this fits the bill."
4,Montana Born and Bred,"I am about half way through this book, enjoying it very much. Keeps you wanting to read, well written. Give this book a try, nice change from modern time story lines..."
5,Montana Born and Bred,Loved it. Excellent. I enjoyed every minute of the book. Hope you have more books by this author....I'm sure that you must have MORE?
3,'Montana Born and Bred',It was easy reading and very similar to the other books by Alexis Harrington. I like the happy endings however after reading more than 3 books they are all similar. I would recommend this book to take when going on vacation.
5,Another good Alexis Harrington,"Unlike some reviewers, I don't think you want the whole story in advance. Let's just say that Sarah has an out of wedlock child (Danny) by a piece of slime named Ethan. Why? Well he seduced her; that takes care of her side of the story. But Ethan only bothered seducing her to provide a child for his wife, Priscilla. That woman is a real piece if work!Bounty hunter Zach is an orphan from New York City who got the short end of the stick in his adoption from the orphan train. He hunts our heroine down for Ethan in order to get his ranch back. It's convoluted, but still realistic. Ethan has his sticky paws in a lot of different deals.It's a nicely developed love story with the requsite love scenes well written. It has quite a few twists and turns to keep it interesting. All of the characters, from children through adults, are fully fleshed out people of interest.It's a keeper!!!!"
5,History Comes To Life...With A BANG!,"History comes to life as Jack Eddinger mixes murder mystery, romance, politics, and espionage into athriller that won't let you stop reading until the lastpage. I lived through the McCarthy era, and it'sfascinating to see the machinations that mighthave gone on behind the scenes during this veryintense period of American life. As a former politcalreporter, the author shows that he knows his stufffrom the inside out. If you like to learn somethingwhile you're having an exciting time, read this book!"
5,"RIVETING!! A CEREBRAL ""COUP DE GRACE""!!(Pardon the pun!)","I was totally engulfed in ""INQUISITION"". The brilliant command of the English language, vivid descriptions, in-depth character development, attention to the minutest detail, and the geographical scope, are overwhelming. It spans the rich industrial life of the Lehigh Valley, and the sophisticated political manueverings of Washington DC, during a profoundly complicated era. Only someone who has conquered these areas could present this revealing insight into the soul of Congressman Zachary Taylor Harris. I thoroughly enjoyed it; was devoured by it. ""INQUISITION"" is the kind of book you won't want to put down!"
3,"Interesting, but a little thin","I have mixed feelings about this disc. On one hand it is wonderful to get some glimpses of the places I have only seen in photographs. On the other hand it is just that, glimpses. It could have easily been twice as long. Cuts are abrupt, sometimes in mid sentence or mid shot. The volume level is all over the place.This is what it is, an amateur video. It's a bit over priced, I think 15 would be a fair price for it. That said I'm glad to have it in my Everest collection, but I feel that it isn't quite worth what I paid for it.3 stars. It's not very good, but it's not too bad either."
4,As Promised,"The publication is as promised. Well defined capsules of songs, artists and reviews. I have started much of my Jazz collection using this book as a guide. I can honestly say I have not been disappointed. The reviews are informative but not redundant. Although concise they are insightful and effective. I would sincerely recommend this book to novice and seasoned Jazz enthusiasts alike."
5,Excellent advice - for both men and woman,"I have reviewed books for a major business magazine for over a year now, and I think this is one of the best I have seen. I worry, however, that the package makes this appear to be only for women. I think a lot of stressed-out men (particularly attorney friends of mine) will find some real inspiration and an action plan for taking control of what little life they have.Some may think this is all pie-in-the-sky stuff, but it's achievable with a little pragmatism. Read it and see if you don't agree."
3,Worth the read if you are thinking of a big change,"Read this if you are inspired in any way to make a change in your career and life. It gets a little dry with all the stories and quotes from other women, but funny and inspiring overall."
5,An over looked masterpiece,"I don't know anything about this band. Where they are from, (I'm guessing it's England), or how many albums they have made. Far as I know there is another besides this one but have never been able to find it.Anyway, this album kicks [tail]! The singing is rather mono-tone and the there are no searing guitar solos anywhere but it just flat out rocks! The best way I can describe it is to say that it is hypnotizing. Listen to it on headphones and you'll see what I mean. There is a lot of passion and heart in the songs and I don't mean of the whimpy variety either. When the singer belts out ""Damn God"" at the end of ""I've Seen The Man"" I just want to break stuff. This is a great album for anyone into collecting underground gems so if you can find it, buy it. You won't be dissapointed."
4,In tranced,"For some reason way back in the day I picked up this CD from the used section having no idea what it was like at all. I gave it a ""chance"" and was blown away buy the power they produced with such grace. It's something to listen to when you have the time to close you eyes and enjoy the album as a whole."
5,top 10 cd on my extensive list,"I consider myself a music guru. with nearly 2000 cd's in my collection, I have been listening to everything from every genre. I must say that ""Scenes From the Second Story"" is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. Their heavier songs are very tight, but they are at their peak in the epic melodies throughout the album. The song ""Seven"" is 16 1/2 minutes of absolute bliss. It opens with haunting, mellow guitar and some truly stunning lyrics. As the tension builds throughout the song, you can't help but be drawn into it. Once the tempo reaches its peak, you will be absolutely hooked. I can't say enough good things about this record. If you can ever get your hands on it (very hard to find), then you must get it. A gem that everyone should experience."
1,bizarre,"This is not so much a novel as an artifact. Much of it is practically incomprehensible due to a great deal of English-public-school vocabulary that few people living will be able to understand. There are pages of descriptions of ""footer,"" including sentences such as, ""The last ball he placed in front of short-leg for a single,"" and ""The next ball was full pitch to leg,"" but there are almost no details of the boys' academic studies or of the rest of their lives. The writing style is very terse and choppy, and the boys have no personalities. The jerkiness, the lack of explanations, and the lack of any character development at all, make reading this book a bizarre experience."
4,does the trick,"My 11 month granddaughter wears this in the heat and it has protected her well. Not the most stylish, though."
2,Only for certain game,"I'm generally a console gamer but since moving to college and having an internet speed that is lightning fast allowing for online gaming, my PC has taken over the role. (I know, good use of a college education right?) I really hate playing games on the PC where my hands are spread over the entire keyboard and I have to remember 27 thousand key combinations correlating to buttons that are no where near one another (e.g. press w + spacebar + c + mouse click for ""rolling thrust."" This was for Jedi Knights:Jedi Academy). I thought this gamepad would solve my dilemma but Nostromo has not updated any of their game templates since 2003. From what I understand Logitech provides more up to date donwloads so I recommend checking out their rumblepad along with the Nostromo, see which one better fits your style of gaming. Cheers."
5,HOLY MOLY!,"This gamepad is amazing. At first I doubted the Action Stabilizer Bar. I then realized it's genius, with this Bar, my action would be stabilized. I would no longer have the dangers of the gamepad slipping out of my hand during intense moments of play. Many a time playing 2d independent games has the controller taken life of it's own.While at first appearing unwielding and a bit insane in design, the controller is very comfortable. It fits like a glove. If your glove size is the same as mine. You know what I mean! :)The copper on the underside makes the controller nice a comfortable. It rubs off on your hands so latter when I'm out with the ladies i can say I was in my workshop making things from copper instead of playing a video game. It really helps. THANKS BELKIN!"
1,What a piece of garbage,"I owned this thing for about 2 hours before getting so disgusted with it that I threw it out. Analog buttons are wildly sensitive...you can't possibly play a third person game without get irritated. The buttons are not too big for the triggers that you have to stretch out of your way to reach them - and I have very big hands.The software is useless unless you're completely outdated still using Windows 95 or 98. The drivers messed with my mouse on Windows XP. The plug n play drivers coming from Windows XP are much much better but they can't save this rediculously worthless game pad.If you want something in analog that is close to a PS2, think about getting an AXIS pad....granted it has its share of problems too but its a much better less sensitive game controller."
2,"Good for PC, Bad for Mac","It says it supports Mac and PC, but it does not work on Mac AT ALL. So if you're looking for a Mac only gamepad, this is not the one for you. Great for PC though. Belkin is doing false advertising and technology."
3,If it wasn't for the D-pad...,"I would have given this 5 stars if it weren't for the flimsiness of the pad. Either that, or I'm just too hard on the D-pad. I think it's more a design flaw though, because I have four other pads (manufacturer withheld) and the D-pads all have held up for several years' time (they are still going strong). I noticed (at least from my FIRST n45) that the pad seems to be mounted on a short post. This post seems to be the weak link; I'm surprised that not more people have reported about this. I now have a fairly unused n45 that I keep basically as a collector's piece. Every so often I may plug it in for short analog games but I try to avoid using the pad."
4,"Can't beat the quality for the price, but...","...since it has been discontinued doesn't support more of the newer games. If you are playing games a couple of years or more older than this is an unbeatable deal, if you can find it. This is a very durable pad for the price. There are others that cost more that are not as durable."
4,Nice gamepad but query for Robert P. Kohr Jr,"This is a nice gamepad but can't figure out how Robert Kohr was able to map the mouse action in analog to the gamepad on a Mac. Robert, if you read this, please let me know? Contact me at albertf at comcast.net --- substitute "" at "" with ""@"".Thanks"
5,Of course they're dobby stripes,"The previous reviewer was disappointed because these were dobby striped rather than plain. After all ""dobby striped"" is nowhere in the discription. Granted, but when buying something called Distinctive Home 250TC Dobby Stripe Queen Cotton Sheet Set it's safe to assume that they're not plain.The five stars are because they live up to exactly what they claim to be: comfortable, good-looking sheets that get even softer when washed."
4,No Cash No Fear,"Funny man, Terry Alen, writing about his roller coaster ride in the world of business, revealing tips on how to start even when you have no money.May not work in some countries, read the book, you will find out!Enjoy!"
4,Lessons in the Laughter,"THIS BOOK IS JUST WHAT BEGINNING ENTREPRENEURS AND STUDENTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP NEED. THE LESSONS ARE PRICELESS. THE VOICE OF THE BOOK SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO ANYONE WITH AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT! EXCELLENT RESOURCE. BUT DON'T LOSE THE LESSONS IN THE SOMETIMES ""BELLY-ACHING"" LAUGHTER HIS STORIES EVOKE!Lurlene Irvin"
2,"If you are looking for a real how-to, go elsewhere.","I purchased this book looking for information on specific methods of financing my pre-startup with little of my own money. I read the book in it's entirety and here is what it is: A wonderful personal story of winning and losing in business. It shows that creativity can be used to overcome lack of cash, but gives few useful ideas. Like I said, it's just a nice story, not a business resource."
1,Elementary,"A fine starting book on das Ostfront for neophytes and college students (did I repeat myself?). If you are anyone well read in this area, skip, nay--run from this book. It will insult your intelligence and you will find yourself mentally adding in the many points the author missed. Some sort of sub-title, like 'elementary guide to ' or 'first book of' definitely applies here. Many mistakes, that even non-experts can catch, abound."
2,Disappointing; buy a different book,"A thick book that covers too many topics, from programming syntax to CORBA, JDBC, and servlets, all superficially, many poorly. The hard-to-understand explanations provide little insight into the topic areas covered.One has a sense that the author rushed to print just to be the first with a Java 2 title, by adding a few Java 2 items to a Java 1.1 text. Some chapters use Applets (Java 1.1), others Japplets (Java 2). Much of the Java 2 material is just filler--listings of the class definitions. Important Java 2 Swing concepts such as the various ""panes"" that are used to overlay graphics (content pane, glass pane, etc.) are not discussed nor does the book mention overriding the paintComponent() method for doing graphics."
2,Doesn't go into enough detail to seriously learn Java,"This book gives a high level look at the majority of Java features, but no serious detail. If you just want an idea of what Java can do for you, this book is fine. If you actually want to program, look elsewhere."
1,Do not buy this book,"I wish I'd checked out the reviews here before I hastily went and bought this book. It is a terrible book, bereft of any useful, real-world examples and full of typos. It skims over topics giving the reader no hope of fully understanding the concepts. This would be acceptable if it had a load of examples that you could use to get coding straight away but it doesn't. By Chapter 5 the only fully compilable code example (as opposed to snippets) was the mandatory ""Hello World"" program in Chapter 1.Terrible book."
1,Very poor treatment of the subject,"In two words, it sucks. I need to develop real world applications, not rewrite 'diff' in Java. This book offers me nothing more than hints about how to address the tasks at hand. I have found myself relying almost exclusively on Sun's Java documentation, and programming examples, to get what I need. I keep trying to use this book as a reference, but am mostly just wasting my time when I do so. 'Mastering Java 2' will make a good back-stop for target practice.If it were not for the fact that I _know_ Java is a superb development tool, this book would persuade me to return to C/C++."
1,"Global overview, yet superficial","In comparison to the Heller-Roberts book this book isn't even close. Everything is in there, yet the explanation is that superficial that you have to go somewhere else to find out what it really is all about. My advice: don't waste your money one this one like I did. Yet, there's no point in arguing about taste."
4,"Not up to date, but very good.","As far as I can tell, this book has not been updated since the publication of the 15th edition in 1960. Nevertheless, although it is not up to date I would not call it ""outdated,"" since it provides a snapshot the philosophical concerns of its day. In this respect, it is especially helpful when one is reading anglo-american philosophy of the early twentieth-century. It is also quite good, in my opinion, in terms of achieving the appropriate balance of breadth and depth for a philosophical dictionary."
1,"Warning, do not watch!","This film is bad on every level. It makes an episode of Scooby Doo seem high-end. It could be an example of what not to do when making a movie. I felt ripped off of my time and money. Anyone giving this film a positive review is either blind and deaf or an investor in or associated with the movie in some way. Yes, it is that awful. It is not even a complete film. The Director has to show the SAME scenes over and over again, and some scenes are shown running BACKWARDS to fill the 110 minutes ( I am not making this up ). The plot is so convoluted, poorly written and boring you end up feeling sorry for the actors. The real title to this thing should be "" Shoot me first and pray I don't live to the end of the film "". Save your money and go to You Tube, the entertainment value is better.`"
3,Interesting but too repetitive,"I found this book to be a good intro to the possiblities of E-Commerce for management-types; however, the book seems to spend a fair amount of time rehashing topics that were discussed earlier. In addition, if you are a techie, you will find the writing style rather wordy and ""very"" non-technical."
5,Great overview,"I will preface by saying that the book is outdated(i.e., referring to the typical fastest modem speed in homes as 14.4) but nothing that any knowledgeable person couldn't insert more current info.Anyway...the book is excellent for providing an overview of E-commerce...it is a very easy read, could be finished in a day or two...the best part may be the case studies at the end. They describe the situation of each company/website and detail how they developed a solution for furthering E-commerce. It even describes what kind of system hardware/software utilized.I strongly recommend you buy this book. Other books could provide more detailed, supplemental info."
4,Good Intro to E-Commerce,"This book is a great introduction for the technology manager who is developing a strategy for bringing his or her business onto the Web. It covers many technology topics, including financial transactions and security. It is most valuable, however, because it presents a wide range of electronic commerce examples, from the typical on-lin consumer product catalogues to complex supply chain integration."
2,spend your money on something else!!,"honestly, and truly, you can get much better stuff off the nets, or even off of cable. your money would be better spent somewhere else!"
4,Wonderful read!,Dreams of Trespass is a wonderfully written novel about a young girl growing up inside a harem. Fatima did an extrodinary job describing how the women of her family managed to wile away the many hours of their imprisonment. She also managed to vividly detail life inside the harem very effectively through the eyes of a young child. This book is a must read for anyone wishing to truely understand life inside the harem.
2,A Bore!,"I couldn't help but fall asleep whilst reading this book. I only was able to go through about a little over a half, mostly because I was required to read it. Generally, the book is about a middle eastern girl living in a Harem and surrounded by the conflicting Western Power, the French Army. Lots of battles with tradition and western cultures, and primarily about the rift between men and women. So you're in for a subtle yet quite obvious gender conflict, which was in my opinion awfully sexist (I know it's from the view of a woman but that doesn't take away from the fact that she explicitly tries to write as if she were a child again with ""innocence"" yet fails because of her mature agenda). The author, Mernissi, spends about 10-15 pages per chapter driveling on about the most useless facts or coincidences. Just when you think she's reaching her point and finally bear fruit, it's the start of a new chapter and another take on a topic or segment of her life that is completely irrelevant."
1,Delusions of a would-be feminist,"once again, mernissi has used the literary forum to vent her personal venom against her faith. As a reader searching for actual scholarly or literary value, I find her books an absolute abomination. A ""bayt arabi"" (arab-style house with a courtyard in the middle) is not a haram, nor is the extended family setting Mernissi describes. At least not in most households. But an account of life in a ""haram"" is sure to sell. I've travelled widely throughout the middle east and have spoken to countless women, in seclusion and privacy, learning their language in order to gain their trust, and rarely have I encountered the kind of frustration Mernissi depicts in this, or any of her books."
3,Dreams of Tresspass,"The struggles of a girl's life in Harlem brings together the major ideas of this book together. In the book Dreams of Trespass a girl tries to understand her place in society, but doesn't want to accept what might lay ahead in her life. As generations go by women want more out of their life and ultimately want to be considered equal with men. Unfortunately not only Men stand in their way, older women are content sticking to the old traditions and it was hard to even explain why they would want a life out of Harlem. The plot in this book in nearly non-existent, the book itself is merely a description of life experiences that will shape a young girls life later life. Untimately I didn't realy like this book because its lack of plot. I was hoping for more of a continuing story, but this book is a series of stories. The author does a good job in blending these stories together, but this is not the kind of book that I would normally ever like."
3,book,"Mernissi's book is a refreshing departure from the usual stories out of the Muslim world. Mernissi does not focus on the sterotypes of Muslim women present in the Western world, but she also shows mixed feelings about the system in which she was raised. It's an easy read, and her style is light and airy. Mernissi's varied childhood experiences are fun to read."
5,A great memoir of a fascinating culture,"This is a profound and philosophical memoir of a period of time when nationalism, women's issues and changing male-female relationships had a formative impact on this woman's childhood."
3,enjoyable read,"Having just been to Morocco and in particular the city of Fez I found the story fascinating and enlightening. We get rare glimpse of what went on in the 1940's behind those high walls with little windows-inside was a whole other world meant to be hidden from the outside world-a ""retreat"" that was supposed to hide as well as to protect women-that ""veil"" was dropped after many years and the author speaks to its demise-enjoyable read!"
5,Harem Life,"I had to read this book for class and I found this book to be easy to follow and interesting. It was interesting because it discussed what life was like in a harem. The book was written from a child's perspective, which made it more personal. The book provides a lot of information on harem life that the reader does not even realize they are being taught while enjoying the story. I also thought the title was good because it describes how the women of the harem are dreaming of the outside world and what is beyond the walls. I thought Fatima Mernissi did a good job describing harem life and I would recommend reading the book for those interested in harem life, Moroccan women, or for enjoyment."
4,Tales of a Harem Girl,"This is a tale of a young girl born in a haran in Morocco in the 1940's and the struggle she and other Moslem women faced. Fatimi Mernissi was a shy girl born into a world she was sheltered from. She is restricted by the Moslem culture, but uses her imagination to escape beyond the boundaries of the courtyard to see the outside world. She is encouraged by her mother and relatives to fight for women's rights and she tells of the lessons she has learned. I think that this is a great book. Very interesting and easy to read. If you have the time, it could be read at one sitting."
4,An interesting and relaxing story.,"This book presents the life of a young girl who is brought up in Moslem culture. She constantly searches for the answers to questions about why women in her culture can not do certain things. This book is well written, and should be read if you wish to understand what the Moslem world is like for young women."
5,Very nice book,The author describes the every day life in a family in this culture. I found it very interesting and entertaining. This is another view of the stories of harems that we hear all the time.
3,Phew!,"Luckily i found this book just in time.It really helped Tina and me to understand our rights better and know what is exactly good or bad according to the law.You will not regret owning this book ,it will always be of immense help in legal issues and even for everyday living.I'm glad i've read this book."
1,some important topics missing,"There is some good information in this book but way to much important stuff is missing. Stuff that should be in *any* linux networking book that is missing from this one include:-discussion of dhcpd, the dynamic host config protocall daemon-discussion of dhcpcd, the dynamic host config protocol client daemon-the routed daemon-any other meaningful discussion of dynamic routing in linux-any discussion of connectivity with Windows machines (SAMBA is not mentioned anywhere in the entire book)It would not be possible to administer an actual modern network without any of the above. These omissions are unforgivable in my opinion. Definite one star."
3,"New to linux ""This is NOT the book for you..!","I have have been looking for a linux book that will get into the details of HOW TO DO real world things. Such as Getting my system on the internet, setting email, setting up sound cards and so on. THIS IS NOT THE BOOK. The book is good on other kind of information but when it comes to "" FIXING YOUR PROBLEMS "" it just does not do it.If you are an expert (Network Admin) on the operating system this is a great book because you can keep up with the lates news but if you are not an expert you will not get much out of it."
4,A really good introduction to Linux Networking,"My one major regret was not reading this sooner. :) I found that this book provides a really nice easy to understand introduction to the different networking aspects on Linux. I had read O'Reilly's TCP/IP Networking first (by Craig Hunt), and it had a great deal of detail. If I had read this first, I think I would have understand that book more so. Nevertheless, both are essential if you want do networking on Linux. My only reason for giving this book 4 stars was the excessive amount of information regarding News servers. I think a chapter or two would have sufficed, and then include some final thoughts and some trouble-shooting. Still, I learned quite a lot, (even on the News server chapters) and I think you will too."
4,Inconsistincies in user reviews,"Many of the negative reviews complain that this book did not tell them how to use Linux. What they failed to notice is that the title of the book is ""Linux NETWORK ADMINISTRATORS Guide"". Networking is about TCP/IP, FTP, etc. If you want a Linux ""how to"" book, don't get this book."
3,Dirk,"O'Reilly was first, but there are publishers now beating them at their game. ""Linux Network Administrator's Guide"" is an OK book. It took the time to introduce me to TCP/IP routing and gateways, but it's one of those books that you have to start several times to get it."
2,not enough to get going,"I am new to Linux, but have quite a bit of experience running large NT networks across multiple classification levels. The time has arrived for me to learn Linux as I believe there will be a compelling economic rationale for moving the back-end of networks to Linux. As I work to master Linux, the incompleteness of the avialable literature is truly amazing. Lots of niches filled, but nothing truly helpful. This book is a bit dated, Kernal 2.2, and it was not particularly helpful to me in respect to file systems. Did not cover extended2 FS, FHS and other, newer systems. Weak on scripting although it does cover API interfaces. Not much on installs/upgrades. A decent resource to have on the shelf to fill in missing holes. I have had to turn elsewhere for a more integrated, comprehensive approach to Linux."
4,Fascinating but not easy reading.,"The book is fascinating and I really enjoy the ideas put forth. The analysis is very comprehensive, almost too much so at some times. The author clearly intended this book primarily to put forth a theory which would withstand peer review and, as such, spends a substantial amount of time substantiating the basic ideas."
3,collapse of complex societies,A review of theories of collapse of complex societies. complete review of the theories on the collapse. It concludes that most of the theories is incomplete. I have not reached the end ...
3,Eh,"This book was OK I guess. It didn't really help with any anxiety, I got through my anxiety with positive things, not this book. It did have some useful information in it so if you get a chance to skim through it or borrow it from someone, then go ahead. If not, then maybe skim through the book in the store before buying it online."
5,Genuine,"This book is a treasure, one that you can't put down. It is a quick read but one that is definitely worthwhile. Although the book has many moments of sorrow, it also has many moments of triumph and genuine feeling. It will touch your heart."
5,Safekeeping,"I read this because I so enjoyed ""A Three Dog Life,"" about a later period in the author's life after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury. ""Safekeeping"" is not as engaging, but worth a look for those who enjoy memoirs and are interested in crafting their own."
2,I was really disappointed,"I read Abigail Thomas' article in the AARP magazine. I am writing a memoir and thought I would like to read one of her memoirs before buying her book which is supposed to tell you how.I decided on ""Safekeeping"". I was so disappointed! I read it in two sittings and was left feeling, ""That is it?"". I've thought a couple of days whether or not I should write this review as several readers have raved about it. The blurbs on the cover do too.I'm sorry, but I just can't agree. I'm glad I bought a used copy and didn't waste too much money!"
2,At Least It's Short(Like My Review),"Two grande detectives are on the trail of a sword wielding killer who strikes at the local drive-in. A few suspects and a few red herrings are thrown our way, but they're not terribly effective.Honestly, I'm not going to waste my time talking about this one much. It's better to just avoid it unless you simply can't help yourself. As a slasher it wasn't very good, nor as a mystery or homage to the drive-in. The picture looks like a dreadful VHS transfer, but I doubt a clearer picture would really make the film better.A few good kills in the very beginning, but that's about it. We all know I love low budget trash, but sometimes I have my limits."
1,Just plain bad,"Young couples get killed in a California drive-in theater by a killer with a sword. Two cops investigate the murders and interview the manager of the theater and the very stupid assistant, former carnival sword swallower.""Drive in Massacre"" is a very talky movie. Most of it is pointless, bad dialogue. There are some murder scenes but no suspense. The cops follow up all sorts of false leads but the plot moves nowhere. Even though the movie is only 74 minutes long it feels very long and is padded with scenes that have little or nothing to do with the main plot.I like B movies when they're entertaining, but ""Drive in Massacre"" is just plain bad with no redeeming values or entertainment value. It's not ""so bad it's good"". In fact I think it might be one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. Don't waste your money or time on it (but if you really need to see it, it's in the public domain so you can download it legally for free)."
5,One slip...,"What is and what will never be - sad but true. How different life could have been for autistic Sabine if she had not been institutionalized. To see the contrast of ""before"" and ""after"" is truly saddening. I can only imagine the regret her family suffers for having let her languish in that institution for so long. Even yet, this one slip is not the end of all hope. With love and proper care, Sabine can be brought back, bit by bit - and although she will likely never again be the person she once was, at least she will have a better quality of life going forward. A win-win situation, for her, for her family, for everyone. This is a wonderful documentary."
3,"Has some good bits of advice, but needs organization","While reading this book, it became clear the author has a lot of good knowledge about the film editing process, plus years of experience he could share. Unfortunately, his writing style, organization, and grammar could all use some work. I couldn't make much sense of the way the chapters are organized, and the contents of chapters often seemed somewhat random. The result is that you often don't get what you're expecting from each chapter, and then valuable bits of advice will pop up in unexpected parts of the book.As a guide to getting the most from Premiere, I don't think this book is very successful. It's too scattershot and, well, not big enough. However, it definitely contains some good information for those willing to search for it."
2,Rather boring!,"Undoubtedly, Waugh is a good writer. I found the subject matter of this novel terribly boring, the main characters strange and uninteresting. I had absolutely nothing in common with any of the characters so I could not make any connection with them and did not care what happened to them."
5,"A Beautiful, Powerful Story","This book stunned me when I reached the end. Throughout, I enjoyed reading about the various characters and the British ambience, and I didn't expect the very moving way in which the main characters ultimately developed. In addition to telling a good story and depicting a beautiful world, the author made some very profound statements about religion and character. It is a book that I will enjoy reading again."
5,phenomenal,It wil llast with you for a long time. Great use of language and pace. Character and timelesness of personal growth and discovery.
1,This book is so bad it is torture to read.,"It is upperclass british drivel. This book should be dropped from school curriculum. This book was so bad it was no wonder when PBS picked it up and made a mini series. If you like the feeling of banging your head against the wall, read this book!!! Otherwise a caution to all who even think about reading this don't."
3,"near miss, but better than most","I very much wanted to like this book, but didn't. Waugh is one of a group of conservative, mostly-Catholic, British writers (Anthony Powell, T.S. Eliot, C.S. Lewis, Graham Greene) who have defied the conventional wisdom of the time they wrote & have outlasted the much more numerous contemporary writers of the Left. And I loved his book Scoop.Brideshead tells the story of Charles Ryder and his infatuation with the dysfunctional, upperclass, Roman Catholic, Marchmain Family in the years between the Wars. The characters are too effete and indolent to sustain our interest, until the rather more interesting conclusion--wherein most of the Marchmain clan have their own religious epiphanies--which nearly redeems the book. I'd call this one a near miss, but better than most.GRADE: C"
2,tired,"The reader, a deservedly acclaimed actor, who was made famous by playing Charles Ryder on T.V. made the recording sound flat. The weariness was probably an interpretive style; but, it made the listening to the recording difficult."
2,<3 waugh's acidity,"i got this book thinking it would be geniously acidic and sarcastic like waugh's other novels. i suppose, leaving my preference for waugh's usual style aside, that this book is alright. just. the story was bland, i kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it never showed up. the main character constantly left me rolling my eyes at him. actually, everyone in the book did, besides the younger sister. she was a lovely smarta**. but i'm rambling. my point is that if you want something acidic and wickedly funny, go for the loved one or a handful of dust. just admire the gorgeous cover art in the bookstore and then reach for another one of waugh's books."
4,The Magic of Youthful Friendship,"I loved reading this book for two reasons, first it completely transported me into another country and into another era. Second, it captured the sheer joy of youthful friendship, where the responsibilities and trials of later life have not yet taken their toll.To me, the book realisticly portrayed the drama of life and how life's experiences change not only a persons outlook on life, but changes the dynamics between friends with whom, at some point, we felt we could never live without. What causes friendships that were once so close, to gradually fade away? This poetic tale allows you to ponder the delicate nature of both friendships and romantic relationships. Every once in a while you get in the mood for a story that will leave you in an introspective, if not melancholy mood......this is such a story."
5,One of the Century's best.,"There is a reason this book was made into a mini-series in England -- it's a classic. No long-winded review is necessary to impart what is important: the novel is surely one of the best-written stories ever. Waugh's use of language is astonishing. His ability to paint a scene and a mood is also a learning experience for all would-be writers. The story itself is captivating, a glimpse into the inner-workings of a rich Catholic family in decline and one man who comes under its spell. These characters are unforgettable, a testament to Waugh as a writer and an artist."
3,"Good, but not great","I had a hard time with Waugh's tone. Dialogue throughout the novel can be described as pretentious, and after reading Waugh's letters to friends and editors while he was writing, I think it's because Waugh himself was pretentious, snooty, and very self satisfied with his writing and newfound Catholicism."
3,Would never have missed it had I not read it finally.,"This was among the so proclaimed 'classics' that in my reading life I had never gotten to. Not sure why. So I finally got it and decided to rectify this missing piece of my literary education so to speak. hmm To me this is a book best read in one's youth for as a 60+ someone I found it nearly silly. Such wordy, lengthening dribble more or less. On and on and on it goes in youthful excess of words, endless 'feelings' and 4 pages of descriptive meanderings to describe a cup. Well, not quite that I'll acknowledge but for heavens sake. Let's just leave it at I was less than impressed and don't feel I'd have missed much had I left this one unread altogether."
4,the biggest interest for me was the historical shock of the period before and during the second world war.,"The characters were generally not likeable; however, it was a different time and place and the characters may have been typical of their time. I wondered how the ""lower"" classes were surviving the war and the hardships. I know that people who were considered ""upper"" class also suffered at that time. Waugh was a product of his class and the times"
3,Brideshead Revisited,"The author's style was somewhat poetic. This attracted me, and I liked the story, but did not find it outstanding"
5,Recherche du temps perdu...,"Aeons ago I was a great pal of Binkie Carstairs, the original of 'Sebastian Flyte' in poor old Evelyn's little novel. (I understand that this is not what the worthy critics say, but let them have their hour.) Binkie was a man of pungent wit, a happily unrepentant sybarite, a mixer of the best martinis this side of Suez, and a dispenser of priceless bon mots, none of which I can now remember. Lord alone knows whether - in terms of characterization, dialogue, setting, use of the weather etc - poor Evelyn's novel is really up to the mark. The word 'overrated' is sometimes bandied about. Of that I am no judge. But as a ritratto of darling Binkie, 'Brideshead' will always seem to those who really knew him a ghastly travesty. O tempora, O Binkie!"
4,TYPOS?: you should have seen the first draft.,"For a couple of bucks, you get Brideshead Revisted on your Kindle !!! You get Waugh's classic story dropped into your mind. (Good copy is not the point of inexpensive e-books.) Screw the typos; Just read the story and count yourself lucky to be hanging out with Charles Ryder and a bunch of religiously whacked out pre-War Upper class Brits....back when religion mattered. Speaking of bad copies, last night, i saw the DVD of the new movie version of Brideshead; and it'a a very poor copy of the original movie with Jeremy Irons et al. Don't go there just download the Kindle version and run with it. The new movie doesn't hold a candle to the e-book."
5,among the handful of the best in his generation,"This is the most beautiful book I've ever read! Esp part one, which is like a revisiting of Gatsby's mansion without the roughness of the American wealth. The only thing I've read from this period that can compare is Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. You can't read it for the plot, but the beauty of the language, the detail, and the simple yearning of a Waugh soul searching in WWII is wonderful"
4,"Love, despair, war . . . read on","While this was Waugh's least favourite of his own books, the one that he blamed for exposing him to the trials of fan mail and public recognition, it is in fact, a great and glorious book. Spanning the short adult life of Sebastian Flyte, it is told retrospectively through the eyes of his friend and former lover Charles, who goes on, once youthful experimentation is over, to carry on an equally passionate and hopeless love affair with Sebastian's sister. But in some ways, these themes are not the great story. The larger pictures are of the slackening grip of British aristocracy, the power of love and the power of Faith. Waugh paints a masterpiece of the sweet, desperate years between the wars, at Oxford, in London and Paris, with one generation lost and the next helplessly watching history lurching towards a repetition of the same madness."
5,A Catholic Tribe in Britain,"Not only are Catholics a minority in Britain, but the Anglican Church is the official state-sponsored religion. Our narrator, a non-Catholic officer based on the home front in World War II Britain, revisits a mansion he first visited as a young man and reflects back on his close relationship with a Catholic family. A non-Catholic himself, he reports to us about their habits and customs almost as if he were an anthropologist visiting a tribe in the tropical rainforest. It's a great book and, of course, it's been made into a Masterpiece Theatre series years ago. There are many reviews of this work already, so just to illustrate the excellent writing, I will just say that I think the romantic episode on an ocean liner during a storm at sea (her husband is absent; his wife is laid up with seasickness) is the most romantic passage I can think of in literature."
3,Book for Kindle,"at this time I have not read the book, I will read it at my earliest convenience. Thank You ."
3,Brideshead Revisited,"I too was going to buy the Kindle edition , I already have it in book form , and both the new movie and the TV series. But after reading the other comments I will not be getting this version."
5,"By Now, Jeremy Irons *Is* Charles Ryder","Of course, Irons played Charles Ryder in the now-classic 1982 television miniseries of ""Brideshead."" If you admired that, you must hear his performance of Waugh's unabridged text on this recording. I listen to it every fall when the leaves are changing, just to revel in the language, appreciate a great acting performance, and to have my faith renewed. When you listen to this, you will feel the ""twitch upon the thread."""
2,BORING,"I seldom post reviews. However this book is so tedious, that I have to say that I'm sorry I bought it, and I no idea why it is so highly rated. I didn't see the tv series, so that must have been better. Even 12 years of post high school education doesn't help me enjoy this, and although the writing is somewhat colorful and descriptive, it doesn't make me care about any of these people. A story about an alcoholic, lots of description, where not much happens for many, many pages, a very slow soap opera; Thankfully it's not too long."
3,Genius Turns to Mush,"The first two thirds of this novel are almost unmatched in Post-War British Literature: witty, insightful, acidly satirical, and, in their own way, powerful. The sense of character and place is especially vivid, and personal and social tensions are brilliantly entwined.The last third is marred by a love interest that is anemic and thoroughly unconvincing. Here the characters and imagery lapse into caricature. Julia's climactic sacrifice is ludicrous, as is a long (and infamous) stream of purple prose.Waugh sought to dramatize the tension between the Sacred and the Profane. But if the Sacred is upheld by a trinity of nostalgia, sentimentality, and reflexive Catholic guilt, lord help us all. Ryder's ""epiphany"" is as much a shallow pantomime as his faux-naturalist paintings.The scene in which the ""hero"" and his aristocratic friends brutalize striking workers for a lark, is one of the most repulsive in all literature."
3,One of the few good books about the decay of the upper class,"Waugh is a great writer! If you don't get to read this book, read his other works. This book covers talks about a wealthy family and how it slowly fell into obscurity. Charles Ryder reports on friendships with various family members - primarily about schoolmate and his sister. The relationships give great insight on topics such as religion and alcoholism."
5,Loved this book,"I ran across this book by accident following Wikipedia links, since I've never seen the TV series. It's a lush delight, with a slice-of-frozen-time writing style reminiscent of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, except this book gives a 1923-1944 look into the life of a Catholic English aristocratic family to whom the protagonist attaches himself. Evelyn Waugh wrote the book during six months spent living on soybeans after a parachute accident, so said he had a ""kind of gluttony..for the splendours of the recent past.""Since Waugh was a convert to Catholicism, he attempts to subtly proselytize his readers, which is slightly annoying since the characters end up renouncing their illicit romances to pursue lives of celibacy. Still, excellent look into a luxurious lifestyle only now afforded by the most ultra-rich."
4,Entertaining novel of 1900s England,"This is an interesting and at times an entertaining novel of 1900s England. It appears to be somewhat autobiographical. The plot line centers around an aristocratic Catholic family in England. The readers follow the interactions of the narrator with Sebastian Flyte, his sister Julia Flyte, and others. A significant sub-plot is the struggles of flawed humans in various stages of faith. It is a very subtle presentation of the Catholic faith and just belief in God in general. This may not be for everyone, but fans of modern English literature will most likely enjoy it."
4,The book must be read slowly and carefully to enjoy it,"The melancholic mood of the book makes it perfect ot be read under the shadow of a tree or on dark rainy afternoons. The dissapearence of a time, of a family, a class, and a love is perfectly mixed in the same story. But to feel it the book shall be read according to its inner pace. If you read it all in one night somehow you will lose part of its beauty. Also you shall not read this book if you are looking for action and fun."
3,The movie was much better.,"I have watched this movie several times and absolutely loved it, but I found the book to be very boring and difficult to get through."
2,Not my type of reading,I did not need to get far into this book to realize this was definitely NOT my reading genre. I do not enjoy reading about War or Post War eras.
3,turns on too easily,"I bought this LED key chain because I lost my Princeton Tec Impulse Multi Purpose Light White LED. The Princeton Tec Impulse light is far superior to this product, except it gets lost too easily. Here's a comparison:Princeton Tec Impulse:1. offers 3 different light intensities among other options.2. easy to turn on and off.Princeton Tec Pulsar1. light is weak (only good for close distance)2. a gentle (too gentle) squeeze to turn on or flick a switch about 1mm to turn and keep on. I find my light on in my pocket sometimes because the switch needs to move only a small distance to turn on.3. Get the Princeton Tec Impulse, but don't lose it."
2,"""on"" button far too sensitive","light is plenty bright enough, but the problem is it comes on almost every time I grab my keys. Just the weight of another key against the button is enough to have the light shining."
3,"Good, but needs work","Indeed, the book does a great job of presenting and using the OO features of JavaScript. Where it fails, though, is in clarity. The authors cram too much info into some of the chapters. I've seen 1200-page books that don't contain this much info. The cost? Clarity! To read their source code you have to have a JS parser installed in your brain: they're fond of putting entire funtions on one line. Some of the code could be candidate for an Obfuscated JS contest. So get another book (like The JavaScript Bible) and learn JavaScript, then get this book and take your time with it. It teaches valuable stuff . . . if you have the will power."
2,Not JavaScript Objects,"Not up to par with the normal writings of Wrox Press. This book talks a lot and gives ideas but fails to properly explain the code or the objects. Chapter 6 is an introduction and discussion on a database application but fails to be anything other than an expanded users guide for the app. More time could have been spent explaining how the object structure in the applications is being used. In my opinion the title miss leads you into something that the book really is not. It should be called ""Ideas for what to do with JavaScript""."

2,dimensions,I totally agree with the other reviewers. It is impossible to purchase a handbag without knowing the size of the bag!!
2,Bad descriptions,"I couldn't agree more of the bad descriptions on Amazon products. I used to shop a lot at Amazon and it used to have very good descriptions. But just recently the descriptions are turning really bad. There are no dimensions, some products don't even mention the material that are made of. I would have bought a lot more items if the descriptions have been better."
2,Vague Description of Item,"I was considering to buy this handbag, but I didn't buy it because of the very vague description of it. The most important lacking information is the dimensions of the bag. Why would they state the weight and NOT the dimensions of this handbag? It doesn't make sense to me."
3,salmon fishing,"I bought my copy in the early 1970's. Still keep it aboard my boat. Still consult it now and then.A fun and informative booklet. Cartoons are great.Wayne Heinz, author of, How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
1,"VERY misleading in quantity ""count""","I would think that a product such as this which ""retails"" around $38 and is ""on sale"" for around $19, it would be reasonable to believe that a spray that is $4.87/count is a ""count"" referring to a bottle of the product. So it was very upsetting to get the package to find out it is $4,87 per OUNCE. Unless this advertisement is changed to clearly indicate it is a price per ounce, I can only assume it is an intentional misleading. Although the product itself is very good, I don't think it is worth $4.87 per ounce, but that's just my opinion. Maybe for others, they see that it is worth that much."
2,Smell is too strong but it does nothing with underarm protection,"I bought it for my underarm and feet persepiration. However, it just smells like a spice and does not help at all. Besides, it burns my armpits and skin turns bright red. It really hurts first 5-7 minutes. Still looking for a good antiperspirant product (("
5,Great Communicator Bertrand Russell,"Bertrand Russell (1872- 1970) was a great philosopher and communicator as well as having the common touch in joining protest movements. Although he is remembered for Principia, the most important treatise on logic in the 20th Century, he also wrote and lectured on politics, religion, philosophy and the pursuit of happiness. Wisdom of the West is a handsome 320 page book with plenty of photographs and illustrations that blend into the text. An outstanding feature are diagrams used to convey the essential ideas.This survey of Western philosophy starts from pre-Socratic to early Christianity, Jewish philosophy to Dante, Bacon to Kant, Hegel to Marx and Sartre to Jaspers and ending in Wittgenstein (1889-1951). There is a personal quality in the writing with the author giving his opinions. If you only want one book in your library on the big name philosophers this is the one."
1,"A book about ""what"" and not the ""why"" of Japan","The author states in the first chapter: "" As a trader, my job is to go into the market and try to make money. We still have almost two months before our fiscal year ends. Are you saying I shouldn't even make money because it will affect the budget?"" ""Yes:' answered the controller, ""that's exactly what I'm saying!""This is a statement about what happens but the author doesn't pause to ask or answer the question ""Why does the budget have to be on target?"" Anyone who has really worked in a Japanese company and who has some insight would give the readers more substance concerning the topic of Japan. Add this one to the list of ""ho-hum"" titles on this country and its culture."

5,Great for transatlantic video conference,"I bought 2 iSight cameras to video-conference between the US and France. It works great. My parents absolutely love it. They can't believe how ""genial"" this is just because of the emotional add-on that the video adds.I also use an iSight to discuss with other colleagues across the US.It works as advertised. This is a great product.PS: both my iSights came with software (iChat AV) in the box..."
1,"Good, but no software?!?","This is a great camera, but doesn't even come with any software! Apple expects you to purchase a $30 program in order to use it for what it was designed for?!? This is the ONLY webcam I know of that doesn't include any software. That alone has cost it 4 points in this review.(ps. Since it's a firewire cam, other software can use it, including some other videoconferencing apps, but you have to know what you're doing, which makes this Apple product very user-unfriendly because of the missing software)"
4,"fun CD to listen to, puts you in a good mood","This is the best Natalie MacMaster CD I have. I own two other ones and this is my favorite. Track 8 is so cool. Since I play fiddle, I can play along with her. She has a music book out. It's a combination of her songs from three CDs.I love listening to this CD around the house. Natalie is such a spunky player, how can you not feel happy when you hear her? I was at one of her performances and was taken by her playing. This is a fantastic CD!"
2,hopeless is goin downhill,"is this cd 4 bucks? yes. does it have 'unreased' tracks from a7x? yes. does it have a a7x music video? yes. is is a good cd? no. hopeless has thrown out old bands from previous hd2y, and what did they gain? yellowcard clones, like amber pacific, melee, and stairwell. this definetly isnt a good thing. yeah its 4 bucks, but really the only thing worth it on this cd is the atom and his package song which is why a gave it 2 stars. but hey, some ppl disagree with me, and if you think its worth it to buy this for some wannabe pop bands, go right ahead."
3,WHAT DID I JUST WATCH?,"Okay, I watched the whole movie, and I was bit surprised by the idiotic ending. Normally most movies where the writer, director, producer, and actor are all the same are extremely bad. This movie didn't quite go that far and it did hold my interest even if one of the producers/leading lady is also tooting her own horn as an Amazon critic. I wouldn't call it a cult classic, but it is a better first step than that of Peter Jackson. I think James E. Roberts has some potential once he realizes his name works better without the initial. I think more Cohen brother's type humor would have made the film better. Kozak's over powering sexuality made the film enjoyable, but there wasn't enough of it. The ending of the film appears to be more of actor/director/producer/writer/ (what a resume!) James Roberts' own writer block. I felt like I was watching a Monty Python skit where they didn't know how to end it, so they made it stupid."
4,BLOCKED is full of interesting characters and great performances,"Pick up this indie film. If you want to see what talented individuals do with limited resources, this film is for you. Well-written and effectively directed, BLOCKED will be a nice addition to your indie-film bookshelf."
1,Don't Waist Your Money !,"Very sorry acting and didn't make a lot of sense! Thought it might me a suspense filled movie, but was I disapointed !!"
3,Take a French Class before ordering.,Beautiful illustrations but all of the text is in French. I guess Thames and Hudson think only the French have an appreciation for great art.
3,Why would u rate a sampler cd more than 3 stars?,"I bought this CD mainly for the two Murcof tracks. Buy 'Martes' by the same artist (Fernando Corona) if you want to add a really classy album to your electronica collection.This 18 track sampler is quite a little gem really, as there's lots of quirky electronica and a bit of indie chillout stuff (not really my style, but OK for 'padding'). The two Icarus tracks are in a similar vein to the Murcof style, if a little more edgy. Both artists combine glitchy electronica with more 'classical' analogue sounds. Both are excellent and engaging.Other hidden jewels are the bizarre little Asa-Chang and Junray track 'Parlor' and the stunning 'Ritournelle' by Colleen - a minimalist chillout foray into the warmth of swelling sound. Rob Ellis' 'Four pictures with Debussy' and A Small Good Thing's 'Owl in a Box' are also worth continued listening.Not bad for 5 and a 1/2 bucks, although it can be found for less than 5 elsewhere."
3,Sharpe meets reality head on,"In this episode, Sharpe has some of the wind taken out of his sails and meets reality head on. For Sharpe and Harper it's not a hero's welcome ! Facing his past, Sharpe renews old friendships (and enemies) from his childhood, but the plot is NOT from one of Cornwell's novels, but was penned in part by John Tams (Rifleman Hagman) and it flows well. The characters are not too ""cartoonish"" and there is enough intrigue, skullduggery and romance to go around. There are some surprises and some predictable turns, but I was satisfied with the outcome."
2,Dreadful and substandard--A disappointment,"As an insight into the exploited class conflict of the pre-Industrial Revolution and hypocrisy of the Crown, this is useful; as a DVD and as a Sharpe ""adventure"", this is best rented or better yet obtained without charge from a public library. It is overly long, often a bore and trite and on the whole a disappointing waste of otherwise superb talent."
2,Frustrating.....,"An industrial-strength table of contents! Inside - fails to deliver.Heaps of missing code, typos. Some good information warrants the 2 stars."
2,Misleading strength series.,"By the looks of the Table of Contents the book should be perfect. I also had a chance to browse it quickly in a bookstore and it look to be alright. When I looked it up for those topics I needed the truth came up. It does not explain matters. How could I be such a fool! Next time I will be very careful about those ""Industrial Strengths"" and the likes ... and probably about the publisher too."
2,Not worth the money,"This book has about the best table of contents that I have seen. A quick glance indicates that this book covers just about every topic needed to write ""industrial strength"" Java application. Unfortunately, the content does not back it up.The AWT chapters (AWT Basics and Advanced AWT) both deal with basic AWT topics. The cover page claims that the book covers Java 1.1, but the examples here all use the 1.0 event model. The chapters ""Interfacing C/C++ and Java"" and ""JDBC"" contain very little content (but the LARGE fonts used help them to stretch for many pages).In general, the book tries to cover too much. Each of these chapters could (and usually do) take an entire book to cover. That would be okay if this book provided a solid introduction to each topic, but in most places it fails to do even that."
1,terrible article...,"One of the worst I have ever read. I don't know how this Wertheim clown ever got published, but I hope it never happens again."
1,Amateur misconceptions at their worst.,"This book is a struggling collection of mistaken, useless, and potentially dangerous misinformation. The author has clearly not done his homework, and is not very knowledgeable about viruses.Apart from the many errors in the book, the innacurate descriptions, and irrelevant information, the author also includes bad recommendations on how to protect yourself from viruses, to wit: backing up your registry will NOT protect you from viruses.This book is no more than a collection of virus-related buzzwords.You will not learny anything from this book. In fact, much of the information presented in it is simply WRONG. I give it a swift thumbs down."
3,info info info,it is packed with information book that i can't say is a manual or research. Unfortunaterly it is very difficult to read. i can say that information is very usefull to understand the core of oilshiping industry. it is really the whole different planet of black oil ways to my car
4,EXCELLENT Quality - GREAT Price - HARD 2 FIND!!!,"I had originally purchased a bedding set which was 3 times the cost of this one and the quality is right up there with the more expensive one.The colors are vibrant - but not TOO much and it's perfect for a boy or girl.My only complaint is that I had a VERY difficult time finding all of the accessories, like the pillow, carved lamp, wall border, and night light. But, in the end I was finally able to complete the room! :)"
5,"How to find the ""hard to find"" pieces","If you check on ebay there is someone that resales most all of the pieces, he buys them from Targets and then relists them. The prices may be a little higher but availability is the key. The shipping is minimal too. This is a great line, and you won't find all the pieces anywhere! I've looked at 4 different Targets locally and some have next to nothing. Does anyone know if they are removing or discontinuing this line?"
3,Always out of stock,I love the way this bedding looks. I wish there was a wall border available online. Also I've been trying to register for my baby shower and the crib sheet and hamper are never available. I have been trying for almost a month.
5,Where to find other pieces...,"I also had a hard time finding many of the pieces to this collection. But, I found almost all of them at the Super Targets. These are the only ones I know of that carry most of the pieces. Hope this helps!"
5,adorable,"I looked and looked for a crib bedding set and I couldn't find anything that cute as well as not very expensive. Then I found this set, it is adorable and not nearly as much as most crib sets. I just wish that Target had the whole collection. Love the set because it is inexpensive, cute and a good quality"
3,"great set, impossible to get",I automatically fell in love with this crib set but it is impossible to get the set. I have gone crazy and so have my shower guests looking for the items. The website doesn't even carry everything...BEWARE it's cute but you might not have the set so be prepared to fight and search for it!
5,You can find other items at the store,"At the stores you can find the wall border, the lamp, and about other 10 diferents items from this collection.P.S. I live in Houston and I do not know if is the same in all stores"
5,Love it!!!,"I went to every Target store and had no luck finding this bedset. I decided to order it online and then by accident I ended up at a Target far from home and decided to check it out. They had the items that were not available on-line. So my advise is do not give up the search if you are looking for some items to complete this collection. The only thing that I need now is the lamp. I found these items just in time since my baby is due on Jan. 06, 2003."
5,"Real, practical advice.","This book isn't about just creating a website--it's about running a business! With the help of this book, I was able to come up with a plan for expanding my business into e-commerce. The book is very readable, and full of sensible advice. Each chapter moves you closer to making your idea a reality. It starts with getting real about what's going to work and steps you right through everything you need to know, all the way through building your site in the most economical way and right up to marketing it. My hat's off to this author for writing a book that's a good read and good advice, too."
5,A Must Have!,Great advice for anyone who wants to do business online. Well-written by a real expert. You won't find better guidance anywhere.
4,"Very Helpful And Enjoyable ""Assist"" For Delft Collecting!","This Rather Large ""Coffee Table Look"" Book is actually has many attributes of a good textbook. It provides the reader with a rather detailed and concise history of the Delft potteries. It also contains vivid descriptions of key wares from certain periods and the popular decorative styles. It also has a very helpful area covering the much debated topic of ""Boerendelftische"" (peasant Delft). It has many clear and high quality photographs that really show the true colors of the pieces (unlike a great deal of the earlier books which had ""technicolor"" pictures). This is a invaluable aid to the serious Delft Collector, who wants to collect/learn more about Delft that just its productions of the 18th century."
3,HP or Otherwise?,This order came thru Photolady and the packaging was photopaper simply sandwiched between some cardboard sheets. No labels as to whose product this really is. How do we know what we are getting?
3,Not true HP paper,"I have the HP Photosmart 100 printer and it came with some HP premium photo paper that has a serrated tab that tears off. This paper is not the same. This would not be such a big deal if it weren't for the fact that the printer I have will only print edge to edge photos on true HP paper, otherwise it prints with a border.Now the paper itself is just as good as the other papers by Kodak and Epson that I have. But it isn't what I am looking for."
4,really enjoyable reading... condensed informational history,"Lucky to have found this one in a ""salvage store"" that was copyright was 1953. Contains so much information amd simplified that its hard to put down. Enjoyed Mr.Weaver's prospective and I am curious to know more about the author..."
3,Skilful but lacking cohesion,"There's no doubt about it that Oscar Peterson, with the exception of Art Tatum perhaps, is one of the great technicians of jazz. His timing, octave stretches, improvised solos and key changes are truly a thing to behold. The man plays with the velocity and control of a concert pianist - in fact it's been said that some of the stuff Peterson played put classical pianists to shame.Nevertheless, in this collection of songs, Peterson consistently seems to forget the key ingredient: melody. Peterson is literally all over the place and is too fast for his own good, constantly jumping all over the keyboard with both his left and right hands. This tends to get boring and sometimes even fairly tedious.In terms of listening pleasure, this isn't the best jazz album available. Dave Brubeck is a much better bet if it's melody you're after.Looking over this review, the word 'technician' seems perfectly apt for Oscar Peterson."
3,"good for learing C++, not OOP","I think author's practical c book is one of the best c book I've read, but when it came to C++ I expected to learn OOP, but not in this book. if you are trying learn OOP (what C++ supposed to be) this is not the book to read. it is good for learing C++ syntex and it's new OOP features(but does not cover indepth). his explaination of each subject is just as good as practical C, just disappointed that book does not cover OOP."
2,I won't recommend it,"There are a lot of C++ newer features not covered in this book. I do not deny that it was possible that this was a good book in 1995, but revisions must be done to keep the book up to date."
3,Good for C beginners,"I give this book three stars because it is misnamed. That's a shame because ironically, it is a good introduction to structured programming in C, and covers just very rudimentary details of C++/OOP. I happen to disagree, however, with those who claim learning C++ is ok w/o knowing C. So from that standpoint, if you are new to C programimng, this is a good book."
4,Source for exercises and examples is available for this book,Some of the reviews below regretted a lack of source code for the examples and exercises -- I would like to mention that the source code is available on the publisher's Internet server. The instructions are in the forward of this book.
3,Would be better if excercise answers were included.,"As a book declaring itself a ""teaching"" reference,it would have been much better had the numerous excercises at the end of each chapter had answers or summarys of core code attributable to making the excercise meaningful.Even if there are thousand ways to skin a cat - the book drops the ball in the context of a ""teaching"" reference."
2,To brief on complex concepts,"The author constantly glides over confusing consepts like reference variables and recursion, and half the time he doesn't explain his code."
4,Good tutorial but too much C++ 'religous' issues,"I have programmed in C before. I found this book veryhelpful in learning the new features of C++. The bookprovides numerous examples. I found it helpful that theauthor takes on example (a class to implement a stack) andcarries it through most of the book, adding new featuresto the stack class as they are discussed in the text.I found that the discussion of programming style and other'religous' issues to be overly extensive and distracting.While it is important for beginning programmers to learnthese things it should be limited to one section of the bookso experienced programmers don't have to sift through it toget to the information we need."
3,practical c++ programming,As a beginning student to c++ i found this book to be confusing to say the least once you get to chapter 9 it really goes off the deep end.The book is best served for someone who is already familiar with the c language it takes too much for granted. I would recomend c++ primer or sams teach youreslf c++ by Jessie Liberty.
2,A disappointing tutorial,"Might be recommended for college students but not recommended for professionals who already know C or Pascal. I found this book to be neither a good tutorial (see ""Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days"" by Jesse Liberty instead) nor a good book for advanced topics (see ""Effective C++"" by Scott Meyers). Too much time is spent on style, and the discussion of exceptions is very inadequate."
4,Abuse of free publishing!,"I have never read this book, in fact, I have never even seen a physical copy of it. I would however shy away from it due to the fact it has what appears to be a chipmunk on the front. Thank You for letting me share my opinion."
5,Best programming book I've read!,"A great guide for beggining to intermediate level C++ programmers. Does an amazing job of laying out guidelines for creating well written, readable code. Includes questions and answers to common coding mistakes in each chapter as well as programming exercises that force you to use what you just learned ""hands-on"". Is the only programming book that hasn't bored me to hell ( much like a good novel I couldn't put it down ). Being very readable, the book makes you WANT to finish each chapter so you can go to work on the next set of exercises and see if you can crank out the next program without errors. Blah, blah, anyhow...If you are just getting started with C++, GET this book ( just know that you'll need another to teach you OOP as stated in some other reviews )."
1,pathetic,"don't even bother. I first learned C++ with this book and then switched to some others, GNU C++ for Linux and C++ How to Program. When I recently went back to this book I discovered what a foul job was done, especially with classes. Declare the data member of a linked list node class as public? Give me a break. He says once that he prefers structured programming over OO. Well that is good, because he sure( ) at coding objects."
2,Between Time and A Bonfire,"As has already been said: this piece was not written by Vonnegut, and it shows. The pieces that they use are good, some of the new stuff works too, but it doesn't hold together. The plot looks like shotgun spray on a barn wall. Pieces hit well here and there, but they don't connect. The tang part is good, a wonderful reason to read this short piece, but don't expect any coherence."
2,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"My favorite thing about this ""Vonnegut's greatest hits"" attempt is that he didn't actually write it; rather, it is an attempt by network television to capitalize on the successful moments of his books and short stories. Well, it doesn't work. The ""Plot device"" is so weak it walks on thin ice-nine; an astronaut trapped in a time warp that throws him into the best moments of Vonnegut's books? Why not give them proper films of their own? And most importantly, how about giving the true authors the blame where it is due? The original idea's are Vonneguts, but this plundering is not. A capitalist bankruptcy"
5,All Hail Princess Yasmin,"This doll is so gorgeous, I can't believe the girl who is keeping such a beautiful doll in her box even though it is the best doll box so far. I ordered her and I can't wait until she comes in!"
3,She is ok,"I think she is ok,But I think her hair is wierd.I think the others are better.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*"
2,Yasmin has gone craziiiii!!!,"I got this doll 4 Christmas and I absolutly HATE her! I mean her clothes r pretty n princessy but I don't like her and never will because:1.Her eyes r purple and r 2 big.2.Her hair is 2 dark(she sorta looks like sasha)and long.3.I hate her bangs.Other than these reasons, I sorta like her."
4,Cover songs make this one a bit iffy...,"If I remember right, Wasted, Fix Me, and Minor Threat are all covers, but I can't remember who by. At any rate, we all know and love the title song so I won't get into that. The real gems on this recording are the first two songs mentioned above. ""Wasted"" is fast, catchy, and loud--you can tell the guys have fun playing this one. It leads right into ""Fix Me"" with no ending/intro at all. I could live without hearing ""Minor Threat"" again in this lifetime--it's not the most amazingly noteworthy song done by Silverchair. My opinion: they really shine when doing their own original songs that don't make the records, but their cover songs are less interesting. But...if you're a Silverfreak, get this because you'll probably be kicking yourself otherwise. And it comes with stickers and a multimedia video--you just can't go wrong."
3,RETURN TO THRASH!!!!!,"DANTE brings a return to a more Thrash metal sound to this new version of SEPULTURA with Derrick vocals....well, this is the album that SEPULTURA should had recorded after AGAINST.....I think the NATION/ROORBACK years take the attention away from SEPULTURA on the TOP METAL WORLD..AGAINST was a good album, but NATION/ ROORBACK are not really inspired....DANTE is better than those 2...Most of the songs are really fast and thrash like DARK WOOD OF ERROR, CITY OF DIS, FALSE, CROWN AND MITER and BURIED WORDS!!!! If you want Max vocals go listen to Soulfly..."
4,The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis.,"This is a great cd, if you can understand the lyrics. If you are not big on understanding metal singers than you won't get anything out of this cd. Other than the lyrics it sounds like one large run-on sentence, to most. I however, like this cd and recommend it to anyone willing to open there ears.b"
3,Please enter a title for your review,"The guitar just sounds kinda thin and not very powerful, which I guess it always did, other than on Roots. Production is the main thing letting them down. The rhythm of the guitar and drums is rarely in sync, and that dichotomy seems to be the only thing maintining any distinct identity for the band on this album. There are a lot of repetitive transitions between two chords and no substancial riffs or progressions. I guess I always kinda considered Sepultura to be a band I liked even though I was never fully into any of their albums, but I think I'm realizing now that I don't like them and I never really did, with the exception of the song Roots Bloody Roots."
2,blah... boring and unoriginal,"I bought this after reading a few magazine articles hyping it up, and couldn't be more disappointed. I was expecting something on par with Sepultura's older material, like Chaos A.D. or Arise, or maybe even the new SoulFly CD Dark Ages, but I just couldn't get into any of it. After a few days I tried listening to it again, figuring maybe I might find something I liked the second time through, but it just seemed ""blah"". I gave it a third listen after a few more days, figuring ""hey, it's Sepultura, there's no way this could really be this dull"" and still just found it plain boring. There isn't a single track on the CD that really grabs me.Apparently other people liked it, or there wouldn't be any good reviews, but I didn't care for it at all. I like SoulFly's new CD Dark Ages much better, and recommend getting that instead. It's the only thing I play in the truck now."
2,Derrick green sucks!!!,"Este disco no es malao pero me parece una continuacion de lo que fue el sepulnation y el roorback...es decir no le veo gran diferencia excepto por algunas que otras canciones ( los intros )jaja...en realidad sepultura es una de mis bandas preferidas...pero a la entrada de derrick con "" Against "" definitivamente el tipo de musica en la banda cambio...against me parece un buen disco , per los que vinieron despues...mmmm Sepultura??...no way....hay que ver el dvd de sepultura en barcelona para darse cuenta que la fuerza vocal de derrick queda muy por debajo de la de max cavalera , yo aun pienso que llegara el dia que se unan con max y cuando ese dia llegue ... que no le quedenla menor duda del discaso que se vendra...sepultura con derrick green no es sepultura para nada.....tenia nuevas especativas con este disco pero....ya veo que es la continuacion de sus 2 anteriores....osea no pasa nnada"
1,VOCALIST MUST GO!!!!,"Is it that hard to find good vocalist? This guys sucks donkey balls, plus all this hype went into this cd but it's one boring cd with 3/4 unecessary intro's. You want good heavy album that does stand out get SOULFLY ""Dark Ages""."
4,DANTE XXI Under-rated Sepultura album,"Had a copy from SPV of the 2006 release ""Dante XXI"" by the legends Sepultura on my desk and decided to pop in again. Wow, love it more now than I did back then. Trax like ""City of Dis"", ""False"", are screaming for that sound system to blast these monster trax. The string section in ""Ostia"" brings visions of Gandalf and Aragon paying a visit to the King's castle in Minus Tirith in Lord of Rings!"
2,Incomplete edition,"There`s at least one major omission in this edition, in the third chapter ('On The State Of War'), and there are probably others as well. With a work this important and succinct, the full text is indispensable."
2,1 Year Warrany vs 7 for a Red Top,"This battery will not keep a charge even if there is a hard disconnect. I went with the yellow top for the deep cycle durability, but ended up with an inferior product. This whole line should be recalled as it is clearly defective. If you want a get battery from optima, stick with the red top. I am unsure if the blue tops have the same issue, but would be wary."
5,The best,Best batteries by far! Great for starting a cummins when it's freezing. Powering accessories like air dog 150 and powering a 12 that hits like a son of a bi***. Without the needle moving on your volts gauge. Overall best batteries in the market!
2,Dead after 3 years of light use. Not worth it.,"Installed in my Chevy Impala in July of 2009. Bought the special AGM charger for it. Had high hopes for it being a good, reliable battery. Started having trouble 6 months ago. Car checks out fine, the battery is dead. I should have bought another $60 battery instead of a $180 one. wasted $120 on a battery that is no better than a common lead/acid battery. Going with a battery with a longer, full replacement warranty next time."
5,Optima batteries rock,"I bought this battery for my 1976 Bronco after finding out how great they are at starting generators in Afghanistan.we can't afford to have batteries fail here so we use the best. i knew it would be a good battery for my ""Mudzilla"" Bronco. they are kinda pricey but you get what you pay for in a good battery."
1,Better available,"I completely agree w/ most of the other reviews. Go to your local Sears, and buy the DieHard Platinums. They are the real deal."
3,Not worth the hype or the money,"There's a lot of un-due praise for Optima batteries. I believe their reputation is over deserving. Granted batteries don't last long in Phoenix, I was expecting more than the 2 years I got out of my Yellow Top Optima; their capacity and life is not much different than cheaper quality batteries.Negs:- The warranty is very poor, nowhere near the level of the competition.- I expected a quality deep cycle AGM to last a lot longer than just over 2 years.Pros:- Worked well under heavy current loads. I run 5 amplifiers that draw about 80-100 amps. The Optima helped buffer the headlight-dimming effect I used to have w/ my stock battery.Overall a good battery, but at this heavy price I would expect a battery to have a warranty to back it up past 18 months and to last longer than 2 years. If you're spending this much, check out the Diehard Platinum or others first, you'll be glad you did."
3,Think twice,"The Optima batterie works great. I have a sound system that runs at 1700 rms and it does not affect the volt charge. I totally love the battery. I have two issues but its not from the battery. One when the battery arrived it was damaged from the bottom. Two the battery has no warranty, for $50 more I could of had a optima batterie with a 2 year warranty from O'relly."
3,optima is great but had to get it at costco,orderd from amazon and received it damaged. i was refunded my money and went to [...] and paid about the same price.
5,Bratz Rock,I got this doll yesterday she is so pretty.the doll war does need to stop but anyway back to the doll I got her for my report card.I had all good grades.
5,Super cool!!!,This Fianna is sooooooo nice.She looks super fab in her outfits!!!SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
4,Impressive Research,"Gordon did his homework in writing this book, and I was glad to see that he tried to grasp Muddy as a man, not just as a music icon or a stereotypical rags-to-riches story. I feel as though I was given a full look at Muddy Waters, warts and all.The one problem I have with the book is the writing style. The endless grand similes were brutal; I found myself wincing at some of them. I suppose the self-indulgent, flowery style fits the idea of writing about an artistic subject, but the similes seemed like a crutch. ""Show, don't tell"" is one of a writer's best adages. Grand similes, to me, scream ""shortcut."" Like a rusty dagger thrust between two ribs, then twisted so that the oxidized edge of the blade could be felt grabbing flesh and grinding against moist bone, it bugged me.That one criticism aside, I, as an amateur historian, author, and blues musician, applaud Mr. Gordon's efforts and highly recommend that you read this book to understand one of the key people in American music."
4,Muddy was The Man,"Muddy Waters' tale makes for a bittersweet read as many biographies of our musical heroes can be. Robert Gordon reveals Muddy as a man in all his glory and foibles, strengths and weaknesses. Mostly, it firmly places Muddy in the pantheon of the great blues artists of all time."
2,A real disappointment,"An admiring though shallow and poorly written account of a unique American genius. Though salted with several good anecdotes, Gordon's book mostly relies on the research and interviews of others and ultimately does little to explain McKinley Morganfield's life and times. For a writer who presumes to account for the life of a musician, Gordon's descriptions of various Waters recordings are especially poor. Far far better is his video documentary of the same name. One suspects the book is the assembled notes of that project."
5,Justifying Muddy's place in musical history,"I have just finished reading Robert Gordon's well researched book on Muddy Waters. It is both very well written with almost poetic insights to his subject and importantly is very thoroughly researched - the Notes chapter at the back is as good a read as the book itself and every quote in the book's text is referenced and for some expanded apon. The book provides the evidence to justify why Clapton, Richards etc rank Muddy as their #1 influence, and puts the story in words that are a joy to read. A brilliant book that details the life of the linch-pin who connects the blues past to today's, and probably tomorrow's music."
4,"Detailed and informative, BUT.......","Robert Gordon's account of Muddy's life encompasses the entire spectrum of a great bluesman's struggles and successes from birth to his death in 1983. The additional notes at the back of the book are great reading and I enjoyed the time I spent learning of Muddy Waters' life.However....there are two major mistakes in the picture subtitles. One identifies Ron Wood of the Rolling Stones as Mick Taylor. Mick had quit the band years before the 1978 photo was taken. Another photo showing Muddy and Son Sims in 1943 identifies the guitar that Muddy is holding as a National steel guitar, when it is obviously a wood bodied resonator, not a steel bodied guitar. If Mr. Gordon is this free and loose with his checking of the facts on the pictures, it leaves me in doubt as to the quality of his research on all the other data in the book."
5,Funniest thing I've seen in years.,"Contrary to the countless Chapelle fans who seem to want to bash Carlos Mencia, I happen to think the guy is brilliant. I've seen ""Not For the Easily Offended"" twice, and I'm going to buy it. I don't buy many DVDs if they can be rented, but this is too good not to have at hand whenever I want it.I pick you, Carlos!"
1,Carlos Menstealia!!!!!!,"I have never liked Carlos mencia, hes arrogant, racist, and a liar. Hes Honduran and German, and tries to pass himself off as mexican so he can sell more. All his jokes are about race, he literally has nothing else, Oh he also makes fun of fat people, He repeats himself to take up time and hes a joke theif. He steals from unknown comics that cant defend themselves and he gets away with it. Joe Rogan is a great person for going after him and trying to bring him down. If you want to listen to good comics, listen to Daniel Tosh, Greg Giraldo, or Nick Dipaolo, not this hack"
2,Old Material being sold as New,"It is very true that this material is absolutely hilarious and that Carlos is doing his best to comically bust the PC culture that has paralyzed us. But this is the same DVD as ""Live 2003"" with a 'Day in the Life of Carlos' tacked on. If you own the later, save your money for a TRULY new DVD or to buy tickets to a Carlos Mencia show. It will be better spent."
5,A milestone in gay comedy,"I'm glad that a comic has come out of the closet and still managed to find commercial success. As a gay man who is hoping for some sort of showbiz career in the future, it is inspiring to see an openly homosexual comic like Carlos Mencia doing the daring performances he does. I was hoping for more hot man-on-man action on this uncensored DVD, but alas, one can not have it all. But in any case, it is hilarious and you should buy it, if not for the great comedy than to support equal opportunity for gays in comedy."
2,Listen: YOU'RE NOT EDGY.,"I'm not saying this as a Chappelle fanboy, or for any reason unrelated to the fact Carlos is not funny. Mencia is a guy who prefers congratulating himself over how edgy and offensive he is, while proving joke after joke that he's PC as one can get. If Carlos wants to shock me, he should try telling a funny joke. I'd be in a perpetual state of awe.Edit: By the way, the reviewer above me is an advertiser. ""Equal opportunity offender"" was a phrase coined by Comedy Central. Nice try though."
1,Just so you know...,"Carlos is neither Mexican nor original. He doesn't want us to get offended by his empty racial jabs (which don't offend me), but I do take offense at his ripping off other, better comedians. It's not an easy thing to come up with material...well, good material anyway. Think of it like a song or a novel. If you wrote a terrific song, performed it at some club and then heard a crappier version of it, recorded by another band, on the radio wouldn't it bother you? Why is comedy any different? If you think it is, then by all means buy this hack's junk, but if you respect integrity don't support this jerk."
5,carlos mencia,"anyone who doesnt get a kick out of this guy, is way too conservative. carlos doesnt try to be edgy, he tells people what he believes. hes one of the best comedians ive heard in a long time. seriously impressed, and new fan. if your not too conservative, give it a shot, and be ready to laugh"
1,Colin Quinn ripoff,"I checked it out to see what he was all about and this was not funny...I'd forgive a lot in the name of comedy but his material is a dime a dozen racist jokes, usually at the expense of the poor and working class and Mexican.I'm sure some people would like it because it validates what they think about these people but as I am all three so I thought it was repugnant.In this current political climate this is totally P.C.All my friends think he is a sell-out to our people.Watch at your own self-revealing peril."
1,save your money America,this guy is not at all funny....he uses material other comedians use and tries to package it as something new...
3,A good introduction with antiquated economics,"RAILROAD ENGINEERING is somewhat pricey for a simple update of a book originally published in the early 1950's. A good introduction to the engineering aspects of railroading but with grossly obsolete economics and operating concepts. This critic, a onetime trackman on the Erie Lackawanna (Local 1502 MOW Employees) and now licensed professional engineer, found the author's suggestion to hire vagrants as gandy dancers somewhat amusing. At half the price, this book would be a worthwhile addition to a railfan's library or to a beginning engineering student's book bag."
5,Raiulroad Engineering by Hay,"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in railway civil engineering. (By the way, I bought my copy new in 1982 for $47.50. You can see what inflation has done.)"
3,Yes it is for student or who likes to start to be Operations.,This book looks old photo but the content is sequence good from basic to advance.The price is higher than usual that student can afford.
2,Cyber Snipa Mouse,"I loved the mouse. I loved the LED lighting. It was smooth and fit my hand perfectly. I loved the dual mode with the click of a button. But it lasted less than a year, and I'm a moderate user at best - I don't even game. So very, VERY disappointing durability. Especially for the money spent. I wouldn't recommend buying it."
3,"ok, more theory than recipes","This book has some interesting recipes and discussion, but it is filled with lots of pictures, theory and concepts. I was only looking for a cookbook, hence the 3 stars."
5,Great meal in a bag!,This is the best meal in a bag I've ever eaten! I added sausage and it was fabulous! Just the right amount of seasoning to make a tasty dish. Love this product!
1,Errors! Errors! Errors!,"I stopped using this book after the first chapter because I found three critical errors in the solutions to the first 15 problems. That's an appalling failure rate of 20%! As of this posting, EngineeringPress has posted no errata on line. From my point of view, this makes the book an unreliable resource for all but the most confident of problem solvers and I have asked for a refund.The solutions provided in this book cannot be trusted."
5,Best Book Ever,"I got this book years ago. It's one of those books that you reread over and over because the advice is so pure, sensible, and hits you a different way each time depending on what is going on in your life at the time. It's an entertaining read. It's written using the characters of Winnie the Pooh to illustrate what could be difficult to understand concepts. As a result, it's very easy to grasp. You don't feel assaulted, guilty or resistant either. I mean, it's Pooh! :) I highly recommend it for anyone doing soul searching or who just wants to understand life a bit better. I've given this book away as a gift over and over again. It's just one of those books that speaks to many people."
4,A creative introduction to the teachings of Lao Tzu,"Most books with the word ""Tao"" in their title have nothing to do with the Tao. THE TAO OF POOH actually explores the Tao and its finer points in a simple and delightful way. Hoff shows a deep understanding of ancient Taoist principles and presents them in the nurturing environment of A.A.Milne's classic WINNIE-THE-POOH. Very creative, and a fine introduction to the teachings of Lao Tzu. Of benefit to readers of all ages."
4,A true original,"This book is a gift in every way. It is remarkably suffused with the sweet, gentle spirit of its namesake, along with the infectious enthusiasm of its author. A true original, and a joy to read."
4,Pooh and Taoism...who would have thought...,Taoist wisdom and Pooh; an unlikely combination. A wonderful intro to Eastern Thought!
1,Left a bad taste in my mouth,"This book was recommended to me by a friend that swears by it because it helped him through a difficult time in his life. I lost interest after the first couple of pages but forced myself to finish it. The author simplifies Taoist thought to the point that it is in line with any philosophy or religion. If you follow the golden rule and listen to your instincts, congratulations, you’re a Taoist. He makes his points by insulting every character from Winnie the Pooh, except for the great Pooh of course, and almost every profession. He needed to spend more time explaining the principles of Taoism and less time trying to explain what it is not. It is not a good introduction to Taoist thought, it just made me want to find a book that is. That is not to mention the bad writing style and confusing analogies. Interesting topic with potential but in the hands of a bad writer it turned to crap."
2,Too Snide,"The concept is nifty, but, alas, in the implementation, this book seems only able to exalt the Tao by denigrating other paths of wisdom. It ridicules science and insults religion. The ""real"" Tao is a balance, but this book, for all its well-meaning, falls from that balance into the ""my way is the only way"" fallacy."
5,This book is both enjoyable and spiritual,"I have decided that this book is a must gift for anyone and everyone you care about. It opens all readers up to the simplicity and joy of living. It helps you realize how much stress and energy, we put into things that aren't entirely important. Meanwhile we allow the joys of life to go fleeting by everyday. A true treasure."
3,"Deep, Simple and Deep","Personally, I enjoy learning. I study the human psyche. I read a lot about the how people face the question of, ""who am I?"" ""The Tao of Pooh"" by Benjamin Hoff provides a view into answering this question, however, I found the use of the Pooh story to describe the Tao and life to be a little deep. As I worked through the pages sometimes I struggled to make the connection and to learn, but then I recognized the simplicity of the message and was able to grasp the author's intent. My roller coaster experience in reading this book went from deep reflective, intellectual investigation, to internalizing the simple messages of the Tao, to a conclusion of ""what did I get from this read?"" On the one hand, during the read I said to myself, ""I will need to re-read this book, or chapters"", then again, despite my apetite for learning, I wondered if I wanted to work that hard to get the message. Judge for yourself if you can gain the simplicity of the book's message for life."
3,"Great book, but horrible reprinting","The ""collectors box"" that this set came in was extremely cheap, hardly felt like the collectors piece that I wanted to put on my shelves, but it's a good book to have, and I'll keep this copy around until I can find a boxed copy to be proud of. This certainly isn't it.If you're going to buy this boxed-set, buy a used copy and examine photos first. This latest printing feels horribly cheap."
5,It's a handy manual for navigating through life,I go back and re-read this book whenever my life seems to be in turmoil. It always gives me perspective on the things happening around me. I even underline or highlight the sayings which are most pertinent to me at that time.
3,"Good book, but not really for me.","This book was good and explained Taoism clearly to me. I just don't really think like that so I couldn't get into it, but my friend really enjoyed reading it and the Te of Piglet also. It's a great concept, I just have too many emotions to ever just BE, lol. Maybe someday I can relax and focus and get the point, but until then it would probably be best if you're actually interested in Taoism before buying this book."
3,Not very taoist,"I gave this book 3 stars because it reads easily enough, there are some insightful moments, and because it is fairly enjoyable with the exchange between the author and Pooh bear. But, this book is not recommended for anyone wanting to understand taoism. Much of the book contains almost bitter western bashing, or the condemning of certain modes of life, which does not actually help to reinforce taoist concepts. There are portions that read more like rants, even."
3,Good intro for the Dao,"This is an intro to the Dao. The Dao, or The Way, is ultimately unknowable. We can try to figure it out, but Lao Tzu even said that we will never truly understand it. The Dao is something we can't really know, but we try to interpret, so our puny little minds can somewhat attempt to grasp it. When Lao Tzu speaks about getting back to nature, the author of the Tao of Pooh interprets a regression. I see it as a purer state of being. This isn't a book for little kids. It's a book for adults who want to have a fun way to be introduced to a complex idea. For those of you who don't understand it, be the water. Water is not the vessel that holds it, but merely mimicks the shape. It is, yet it isn't. It flows where it may, and yet can wear away granite. Just be the water. It's alot less stressful."
5,"Pass the Honey, Please!!","This was the first book that I read about Taoism, and that was about 30 years ago. since then i have become a Tai Chi teacher and lead classes on the wisdom of the Tao Te Ching, the classic manual of living that is the heart of Taoist philosophy. This book sums up, very simply, the essence of Taoist thought (or, no-thought as it were) and does it in a most entertaining way, through the eyes of the the Master taoist, Winnie the Pooh. This is a book that you can also read to your kids, who will probably ""get"" the ideas put forward here very easily. Highly recommended!"
5,Uncarved Block,Taken as intended this book is a delightful view of Taoism but to do this one must disregard the authors attitude that Western Science and such things are futile.
4,a peaceful book that sometimes loses its peace,"I liked this book. It made me feel peaceful while I was reading it. However, I feel that Hoff's sometimes biting comments toward other people's views broke the peacefulness of the reading at times. For example, while he describes the Way as something that everyone must find in his or her own way, he openly criticizes Confucianists and Puritans. Although the traditional Taoist approach is that following set guidelines will likely steer you away from the Way, perhaps for some people, living within guidelines of Confucianism or Puritanism is their Way. Whether it truly is or not, I felt that Hoff could have shown more respect for others' points of view at times. Nevertheless, I think this book is well worth reading, especially for someone new to the ideas of Taoism. If you are looking for a similar feeling of peacefulness while reading, try reading Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse."
3,An unfortunate misunderstanding.,"Mr. Hoff, in quoting ""The Vinegar Tasters"", may have misunderstood Buddhism. As a Buddhist, with some experience, I have never looked at the Universe as a 'setter of traps' nor am I embittered by life on earth. Just saddened. More likely, we are the generators of illusion and are working out our karma. Buddhism is more in accord with finding the lessons of our lives in our karma and taking responsibility. We do not turn away from the 'dust of the world'. We wipe it from our eyes.Other than the above, I find joyful calm in its reading."
3,I'm being GENEROUS with 3 stars....,"I like what I read or I hate it. Simple as that. Well, This book was annoying in several ways, yet my affection for Winnie The Pooh bouyed my rating of the book, and my interest in Eastern philosophy. I was apalled by Hoff's constant bashing at ""intellectuals"" and veiled ranting. I was also annoyed at Hoff's bashing of other faiths as essentially being ""Wrong"". A true Taoist wouldn't beat someone over the head about how ""wrong"" their Way is because it happens to be structured and staid. That may just be the natural-flowing Way for them. It's a so-so introduction to Taoism, so I'd recommendTao: The Watercourse Wayby Alan Watts and a nice translation of the Tao Te Ching. Put the two together and you'll grok it better than Hoff ever will.Then Again, you can read Hoff's books with an open mind....and as a preacher I once knew said ""Eat the meat, and leave the bones""."
4,Interesting concepts,I learned of this book through my truck insurance auto person in Minnesota. He told me of this book and I bought it and thought it had some great insites on life. They were always there but Pooh brings them out in a way that makes me think farther into it. Really good. PSM
2,a large cloud of smug,"I've been through this book a few times now. I admit that Pooh seems a good Taoist, if I remember my theology classes right. I will also go so far as to say that the book amuses from time to time. Where the book falls short in my opinion is the narrator's tone.Mr. Hoff's contrasts between Taoist and Judeo-Christian approaches to life invariably give the air of self-satisfaction one so often finds in Western converts to Eastern religion. It is this pall of smug (apologies to Trey Parker and Matt Stone) that makes the book progressively more annoying as the pages turn.I'd give it 3 or 4 stars for accuracy and explanation, were it not for the tone."
2,The wisdom of Pooh,"Benjamin Hoff creatively explains the principles of Taoism through Winnie-the-Pooh and his friends Eeyore, Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, and Christopher. By showing how the others fret, analyze and calculate, Hoff effectively shows that Pooh is a Taoist because he just is."
2,"Very, ah, opinionated.","Telling us how great your philosophy is? Awesome.Telling us how terrible other ways are? A bit heavy-handed, mayhaps."
5,Pooh just is.,"On a day when I was feeling particularly (oh dear, I hate to say this) sullen - I picked up the Tao of Pooh to soothe my spirit. As always, I was charmed by the Pooh stories (they take me back to when it was - or seemed to be, so much simpler to be alive), and soothed by the Taoist principles Hoff explains through the stories. I've had The Tao of Pooh for a few years now, and I always know that solace is to be found in its pages. It never fails to work a wonderfully simple magic."
2,Good in Theory,"Here's an idea: explain Eastern philosophy and how it can better your life in a way anyone can understand by relating it to Winnie the Pooh.Unfortunately the way it relates is as simple as the title would suggest.The concepts are all there, but the method of explanation isn't always clear. It's unfortunate, because it was a good idea. It just wasn't executed properly.Still, it's likely easier to read the Tao of Pooh than any regular Tao book."
1,Dumbs down the value of Taoism,"Leave it to a Westerner to dumb-down Daoism. It can happen in the East without our help.This is a cute book and could have been a fun read if I didn't understand philosophical Daoism.Let me say that I'm glad that folks love Winnie and company. I do too. I think the characters are great but Daoism doesn't describe them or their lot.The problem with oversimplification is that it ignores and perhaps disparages, deeper values to be realized.Modern Western process philosophy has been coming around to the value of Daoism's ontology and metaphysics for years now, and to reduce these values to Winnie the Pooh is not helpful.I apologize if this offends anybody but just as we tend to make God and/or Jesus sound too much like Santa Claus, the referents are so much more than our fundamentalist beliefs of them."
2,Too Idealistic,"The Tao of Pooh brought out many emotions from me. Most of them were argumentative and the rest were indifferent. What made me mad was that the author was too idealistic. He mentions something like we should just let things happen and they will get done. Well in my American society, things don't just happen by them selves and things don't just fall into place. It takes a lot of work to make things work and more work to make things work right. In addition, this book is very one sided. It would have been more effective if Benjamin Hoff found some way to relate Poohs Tao way of life to that of another animated character that follows, Confucianism, and/or Buddhism.Targeted Readers: People interested in philosophy, Tao way of thinking, people against and for an idealistic society."
1,Fish out of water,"Please, please buy 'The Way of Zen' by Allan Watts and 'The House at Pooh Corner' by A.A. Milne, rather than this book. Hoff does great injustice to both Zen and Pooh in this trivialization of the artless and the sublime. Only the kind of people who think a five-star haut cuisine meal is a rip-off because you could get more at McDonald's for the same money could possible think this a good book. Zen is not explicable (see Watts' book) and Milne (re: Pooh) is inimitible. These observations are doubly true in the case of someone, like Hoff, who has a severely restricted vocabulary, no facility with the language and a complete lack of respect for his subject matter. Please, please DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Bitter and Vacuous,"Apparently, Taoism is about lazy, bitter Westerners superficially embracing Eastern mysticism in order to boost their own egos - and then cashing in on a beloved childhood icon to make a quick buck.Hoff does a reasonable job of using actual quotations from Pooh to illustrate various simple points, but his depiction of Taoism ends up being a collection of empty mantras that have no relationship to real life, where people frequently have both aspirations and problems. Do you want to work towards a career where you can make a difference for people? Hoff's answer is ""don't strive - just be"". Upset about global inequality and mass starvation? ""Cottlestone Pie"".Hoff blatantly misreads Pooh to tell us that knowledge and science bring nothing but trouble - as he puts it, discovering things only leads to more questions, so what's the point? He even rants against jogging and tennis. Better to remain ignorant and immobile - although complaining bitterly seems to be an acceptable activity."
2,Piglet an Pooh,"The author of this book mentions early that it would be very hard to combine the teachings of the Tao with Winnie the Pooh. He said that his colleges said it was crazy and too dificult. Well, it was. Winnie the Pooh plays no role in this book besides mentioning several times how much honey he likes. So the author continues to explain the signifance of Tao and in between injects a pooh who is looking for honey or has some irrelevant conversation with Piglet. In conclusion, if you want to find out about Taoism, don't read this book."
5,Taoism you can understand,"If you want to share the fundamental experience of the Tao, Winnie the Pooh lives it."
2,Patronising,"The one message I got from this book was, basically, ""anyone can be a taoist if they're stupid"", a message which would grate on the nerves of many intelligent people studying Taoism - and any other philosophical/religous movements. The author seems to take pride in stating - through the character of Pooh - ""I am not very clever, ergo I'm a lot closer to the uncarved block than you are"". Spare us! There's a difference between ""not being interested in knowledge"" and ""being stupid"". This book appears not to know the difference.For someone who knows nothing of Taoism, there may be some interesting thoughts in here, but I fear it may leave them with the impression that the only prerequisite for being a taoist is being fick."
4,Nice little book,"A nice introduction to eastern philosophy and a good read for those seeking wisdom. In a modern society filled with superficial standards, noise polution and electronic everythings, this book is a welcome break that may just affect the ways you think and react. I also love and highly recommend the ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life"" book of wisdom by Taro Gold which, like the Tao of Pooh, teaches that life is not about what happens to us, it's how we perceive what happens. Wonderful!"
5,Simple and Pure Thought,"This book was recommended to me by a close friend and he was correct in saying that I would enjoy it! I loved it! The book is well written and I feel that by using our favorite characters, whom many of us have loved and grown up with; together with their own characteriatics, makes the principles easy to understand and shows the way to how we can implement what is being taught.I believe, we can all see ourselves in one or more of the characters and although some may not be happy to see ourselves mirrored in such a way, that too is part of our growth as well; and what I believe the book is trying to teach us. We can all become ""Pooh like"". To find our way, to become quiet and still and to become more child like in our outlook of life. Not to take things (or ourselves), too seriously but to ""go with the flow"" and enjoy life to it's fullest.I can recommend this book highly to learn from, to live from and to find our way."
3,A simple reminder,"If you are already a Taoist, this book will serve as a cute reminder of ""the Way"". If you are not familiar with Taoist principles, you may find this a bit too brief to really understand Taoism. I recommend ""365 Tao: Daily Meditations"" by Deng Ming-Dao, for daily reminders and teachings."
4,The way of Pooh,"So far I have only read ""The Tao of Pooh"" and I liked it. It is a cool way to describe and teach Taoism. It is even better if you have read other Taoist books before. The author really has you thinking that Pooh is the perfect Taoist. I recommend this book to all lovers of the Tao."
2,poor role model,"Winnie the Pooh is too stupid to be stressed out. He is obviously fry-brained from doing massive quantities of drugs in the 60's, which the author neglects to mention. So if you want to be like Pooh, smoke up. Then you won't care about anything and will be content with doing nothing all day except smoking pot and eating honey."
3,Sweet Reading,"""The Tao of Pooh"" is a very sweet book, which opens up the reader's eyes to another perspective. In fact, it throws the basis for a further reading and study into the art of Tao. I'm sure it will help a lot of people look life in another light, and maybe live a less stressfull and frightening life, too.Enjoy the reading."
5,An accepting book for the accepting individual,"If you can read this book and keep in mind it is not trying to rape you of your deep ""spirituality"" and it is simply simple. If you don't like the idea of the Tao being discussed vaguely, then why did you buy a book titled ""The Tao of Pooh""? I enjoyed the way he explained the Tao with Pooh who we can all relate to at times. If you are looking for a deeper book, try not reading books, because no, you will not find true enjoyment of like in a book. I suggest drilling a hole in your scull so you can find your Nirvana. I personally would rather to reach that state of mind through meditation, and, here is the secret key, life. You can reach me at jason@shimainc.net"
2,The Irony? Hoff Writes Simple-Mindedly,I would have been more interested in a high-schooler's ten-page thesis on the subject.
3,Good wholesome fun,"I 'member seein' this as a kid in Etobicoke (Toronto, Kannader) - my Dad was a missionary, so the plot was of particular poignance... He never took on the Mob, but it was fun to see that church life could be so, uh, jocular! Me'n my siblings'n folks all had a good time, and there were no 'embarrassing' moments (for me back then) in the movie where somebody was kissing, or hugging or doing anything 'intimate' that you just don't DO... particularly onscreen - Lorr-dee!"
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,"I watched this great Disney movie as a child and was hooked ever since! The screwball antics of these church ladies is shocking and funny! ""Roll Out The Barrel!"""
4,great flick for kids & adults alike!,This has been a favorite of my family for years. It contains all the exciting elements of today's action films without the gratuitous violence and graphic violence.
4,love it,this dvd came to us on time but was floating in it's case. thought if there had been more padding it may have stayed still and not had the possibility of scratching.
5,"Light-hearted, have a good time movie.","I loved this movie. I liked Barbara Harris from Disney's ""Freaky Friday"" and Hitchcock's ""Family Plot."" I also loved Karen Valentine from ""Room 222"" television series. Ruth Buzzi is always hilarious but Cloris Leachman stoled the show. There is a car chase that is simpy hilarious, and thanks to Cloris Leachman, I was doubled over in laughter for the whole scene. This is simply a light-hearted, have a good time movie."
4,Deja View!,"I really liked this movie for it's vintage character actors and the slapstick humor. I used to watch it with my sons back in the day and the premise of the movie and the way they go about solving the situation is unrealistic - BUT FUN, like most movies. I recommend it if you like older movies."
4,Excellent,"This is an old movie (circa 1970). Slap stick comedy. Great actors. Made for children/teens of that era but still very funny for adults now. A ""Must see""."
3,I've Seen This Movie Before,"This movie has DISNEY written all over it. Before Disney branched out with other production companies and started making more action films with less humor, these characters knew how to take a bite out of crime in their own hilarious way.May I suggest you see MARY POPPINS; it's ONE of the BEST DISNEY live films yet mixed with some animation. But if you want more humor, see WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT. PPPLEEEASE!!!"
3,included CD did not install the program,"The CD included with product would not install the program onto my laptop. I had to go to the D-link website on my desktop (it had internet), find the download program match for my specific product, transfer that program onto an information disk and put it on my laptop. I am NOT computer savvy and this was not an easy task for me. Other than all that, I am finally using the product on my laptop and it is performing well so far."
4,Overall Very good,"I own this for a dell laptop, and it works very well. I use it for a home network, and at my college to detect wireless signals in the classroom. The only issue i have is that when i first turn on my computer i have to open the program that comes with the device, and go to configuration and then hit apply before the internet will work."
2,Hardware Version B3 doesn't work on my laptop,"I have a brand new compaq presario x1000 laptop (winxp) that this card (hardware version B3) doesn't work on using drivers 2.48. The laptop is fully updated with all drivers and firmware, but this card still causes the touchpad to freeze and runs the cpu at 85% utilitization for unknown reasons, except for some apparent hardware conflict with synaptics touchpad.The only reason this card gets 2 stars is because it does work on my old sony vaio fxa32 laptop running windows 2000, but the best throughput i ever got was about 30mbps, even with the super-g router DI-624 (hardware version C).Stay clear of h/w version B3, which is stamped on the outside of the box."
2,Inconsistent performance,"(+)Great price, high speed(-)HOWEVER before you buy this consider whether a cordless phone is used nearby. The DLINK card consistently drops connections when I use my 2.4 GHz phone even at 200 ft away. Yes, I should expect that due to the fact they use the same frequency but I NEVER experience interference with my 2Wire wireless card which was so much more reliant and is used at the same location. The DLINK card keeps dropping connections when the phone is used. It is incredibly frustrating and I am going to consider returning it.Third DLINK product I've bought, third satisfactory result from them. I've also used a total of 6 wireless cards and 3 wireless routers/access points. Although DLINK isn't at the bottom of the heap, it sure hasn't performed at the top. Checkout 2WIRE (hard to get retail) or Netgear's equipment."
5,"Works as Stated, Plus Some Perks","Very useful utility, strong range, simple setup, and some what inexpensive. I like it as much as you can like a wireless adapter. Thanks D-Link!"
5,Almost Invisible ...,"This card just sits in my Dell notebook and is almost invisible. In the sense of I never have to deal with it, or take it out, or reseat it in the slot, or even mess with the software, it just keeps working. I just boot up my notebook and before I open a web browser I am connected to my home network. It's great!I don't even remember installing this thing, so I guess it was pretty uneventful. But I do know it's easy to configure and has an easy to understand software interface when you do actually have to change the WPA or WEP key. Very nice.Overall I'd have to say this is a 5 out of 5 stars. I'm not sure I could ask much more from an adapter card, unless of course it could someway be built into my notebook. :)"
4,Fairly happy,I've never used wireless networking before this and overall I am pleased. The only issue i have that occasionally I'll lose signal even when my computer doesn't move. (And I frequently lose signal when I move outside) It's kinda annoying but like i said overall it was worth the 30 bucks.
2,Crashes Often!!,"I bought one of these last week brand new, and will probably have to return it. The 108Mbps is great, but the card crashes my machines frequently. I have two toshiba tablet PCs, both freshly installed with Windows XP, and the card bluescreens either one at least once a day. It also often simply quits working, and requires a reboot to detect my d-link access points again. On install with the very latest drivers, it complains that the drivers are not signed by Microsoft, which should be a warning. They seem to be very crappy stability, these would never sell in Japan."
4,it works as advertised,"The G650 works as Advertised. However, I find there are many other better products out now.The corded D-link USB adapter I bought since I bought this G650 is far better than the G650 in my particular application. It gives you the flexibility to move the antenna to a better reception spot.My G650 sits in a drawer..."
5,Works Like a Charm,"I had originally installed the drivers wrong, but my buddy helped me out and now it works great."
5,"Great product, Great price","I installed this last night on my Dell Laptop and had absolutely no problems with the CD-rom or the adapter. I am using this with a Linsky's Wireless G router, not a D-Link, and it works perfectly. I get reception from anywhere in my house, upstairs or down. Reception is Excellent on the same floor(2nd) as the router, Good or Very Good on the first floor. I've only used it for a day so I cannot review how reliable this is over the long-haul, but so far I'm very pleased with my purchase."
5,Good product for less,"I got this for an older laptop for a visiting guest. It works just fine, doing what it supposed to do for less."
4,Compatible with everything!,"I love that this is compatible with most operating systems (I tried on Vista and Ubuntu, my laptop's integrated card didn't work on either). Signal strength is not that great but enough for average use."
1,************ Avoid D-Link Products ********************,"The product may perform up to your expectations but I only hope you never have to interact with D-Link's support organization. After dealing with conflicting, contradictory and completely erroneous information from their support organization, I have come to the conclusion that I don't care to do business with D-Link again.I hope that if you do buy a D-Link product it works flawlessly (which mine did not), and you never have to call their tech support organization."
4,Works great,Works great with Linux Mint 13 Cinnamon running the ath5k driver. Getting 48 to 53 Mbps on a router that is not D-Link.
5,Great wireless card,"The main reason I got this card is because it working in Linux (It has an atheros chipset), and it delivers. It works great, and the range is awesome.For Windows users, it works great in XP as well.Overall, I am very satisfied with this wireless card."
2,Didn't work for me !,"I bought the DWL-G650 card (Version B4) along with the the 624 Router. THe router was easy to install and configure. Work great.But this card was a pain. I have HP laptop with windows XP properly updated to the lastest service pack.Windows was complaining about that the drivers was not ""Windows logo testing"" certified ! Even with the latest D-Link drivers ....So, everytime I reboot my machine...windows asks me to re-intall/configure everything...totally unacceptable....Let's be positive...of course, I got this card running...it works great ..but I could not fix the problem above...I didn't want to call customer support as well :-) ...I tried a Netgear card after....was working without any problems."
4,Works as expected,"I am using the D-Link AirPlus Extreme with a Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router. It is a good combination so far.However, I want to give readers an important tip. I was originally using a Linksys WPC54G cardbus adaptor. It worked well for a couple weeks, then stopped working all of the sudden. The reason - I don't know for certain - but my guess is ESD, Electro-Static Discharge. So be careful when handling your cardbus adaptor - treat it like you would a memory chip or PC card.I can't give this 5 stars - too soon to tell if it is as sensitive as my old Linksys adaptor."
5,D-Link DWL-G650 Wireless Card,"I currently have two of these cards and I have been very happy with them. I haven't had any issues installing drivers. The card always seems to connect and work well. I also have a D-Link wireless router so the cards connect at 108Mbps, double the 802.11g rated speed of 54Mbps. I would recommend this card."
1,Does not install properly on HP notebook running XP,Did not install properly. DLInk customer services was not one bit helpful. Drivers have not passed Microsoft's scrunity. I cannot recommend this at all.
1,Beware,"I bought the card because I had heard that D-Link had good customer support -- what a mistake -- after waiting on hold forever a hopeless technical support person says there must be ""some sort of hardware conflict"" and I should call my laptop maker. When I asked wasn't there anything he could suggest -- he suggested returning it -- which I will."
4,great,So far its doing well. I get better Signal then my old card and its a lot faster so I can surf the net quick.
1,Worked like a charm for 24 hours,Install went smooth on my W2K/dell inspiron notebook. Everything worked fine for 24 hours then it just stopped. Worked with customer support for about an hour getting nowhere. This thing is junk. I'm sending it back.
5,Wireless Card,Excellent card. Speed is faster than wired. Extended range is a real plus. Easy set up and reliable connections. Recommend highly.
1,It Just Made My Laptop Freeze...,"I got this wireless card because I wanted to try to find one with a broader range than the one I currently have. This one seemed to be able to do the job, so I ordered it here on Amazon.After installing the software and inserting the card, my laptop completely froze. Restarted my computer and tried again and again and again. Each time, the card froze my laptop. I even uninstalled then reinstalled and tried some more...no luck.It could just be some sort of incompatibilty with my particular laptop, but I highly doubt it. I think its much more likely that this wireless adapter is a piece of junk."
3,D-Link is relatively fast but not compatible with Dell Laptops,"I bought this product to get 2 Dell laptops on my network. These productswould not work properly with my Dell 3800 or Dell 5000. When plugged intothe laptop, the keys on the right side of the keyboard quit working. I tried three more different cards before I found some that worked properly.The problem evidently was the laptops and not the D-Link DWO-G650 cards."
4,good product,"Actually I was not quite satisfied with this card at the beginning, but since I updated the driver. Everything works fine. I got very good range in the building. I am a little bit far away from the access point and the AP's signal is not strong enough,but I still have a stable connection. It seems windows xp is always over optimistic about the signal strength,but d-link's utility is more reliable.I have tried several other wireless cards, like us robotics, not as good as this one."
1,Junk. Don't buy!,Okay these things are probably obsolete already but don't buy one! I bought this years ago and ended up throwing it away a few weeks later. It kept crashing my computer. I bought an internal card and it has been excellent.
1,Don't use this card with a Dell Inspiron 4000!,"After three frustrating months owning this wireless card and trying to get it to work with my Inspiron 4000, I am giving up. It has never worked properly, even siting right next to the base station. A lot of the time the card isn't even recognized by the computer as being in the slot. This is documented by D-Link as a problem with Texas Instrument-made slots, which the Inspiron has. Unfortunately D-Link's customer service is so poor that you get a different answer each time you call. And then the solutions are something like ""reinstall your operating system,"" even though there is a documented problem with the hardware. Don't buy this for use on an Inspiron 4000!!"
4,Good value for money,"All,I Have used this card to connect to various routers and it works well. The Extreme G mode is problematic to enable sometimes. New drivers are available, make sure you down-load the right one. D-Link how about having an automatic update command ?, instead of letting the user figure out which card version he has ?./Brian"
3,Dlink cardbus dwl-g650,The instructions were pretty clear. Unfortunately I could not get it to connect to my network. It had no problem connecting to other networks in my neighborhood but not mine.I asked Dlink for help and got no response.
4,Good Upgrade,"This is a good product. It replaces an earlier card, DWL650+ that had become dated. Though it still worked, it was not able to interface with some of the newer security demands. This is a much faster replacement. It works well with both XP-Professional Linux (both Ubuntu and Puppy)."
4,Good purchase,I bought this item to use on a Linux laptop. Installation was easy as Ubuntu pretty much took care of everything. I've been using it for a couple of months w/out interruption. Works great.
5,dwl-g650,"I wanted a PCMCIA wireless card for my 2.4Ghz (older) laptop running Slackware 12.0. After fussing with /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf and getting ndiswrapper set up, everything works fantastic! I was wondering how a $9 card would be, but I highly recommend it."
1,NUTTY MOVIE OF A PITIFUL (!) KILLER,"On-location shooting of sleazy streets and bars are nice---but there's only a few minutes worth; the rest is pure 60s, pre-DEATH WISH pity-killers nonsense.""He's a good boy"" the hoodlum priest tells the govenor, about a young killer...! The priest bad mouths the victim by saying he was going after the killer with a crowbar---never mind that the victim with the crowbar was defending his property against the killer who was burglarizing his place!!!Professional critics, like Andrew Sarris, actually like this movie a lot more than DEATH WISH and DIRTY HARRY----though only because this movie is against capital punishment, and pitys killers and other criminals as being misunderstood.From the director of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK."
2,Dull,"Yes, it was a bit of a romance, but I'm glad I didn't pay any money for it. Too much like a soap opera for my taste."
2,The Indiscretion of the Duchess,"Boring and incredibly pedantic. Thank goodness authors don't write like that today. Yet Hope was a very successful and appreciated writer in his time, Styles change over the years of course andso do the tastes of the reading public, This book is a good example,"
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"I bought this thinking it contained the original recordings, butwas I wrong! I was deceived by the wording ""Original MusicorRecordings,"" but it's not the Platters!"
1,Poor quality,"Very poor recording. Sounds like it is muffled or filtered. Fortunetly most of these tracks are recorded correctly on the 2 CD set ""The Magic Touch"". Skip this and go to ""The Magic Touch"""
4,wolfman says,"this is a great album but i wish i could listen great songs for weddings, or just alone with that special someone!"
1,Junk,Spent hours of time with my ISP and D-link people. Simply cant stand a conection for longer then 2 hours...
3,Not user friendly,"I tried a lot to do the initial set up.After lot of trial, I got the router working, but again if you connect throght your LAN, the connectivity setting was lost.To make my net connection simple and working, finally I returned this product back."
1,Worst Ever,"Works for about 3.5 minute intervals then disconnects. This product is the worst ever. Don't waste your money. Replaced with a Linksys, now wireless network NEVER disconnects."
3,rude tech support staff,"After spending almost 1.5 hours trying to setup my DI-624, I called the tech support line for help. The tech who helped me didn't seem like he's interested in the job. Instead of walking me through the setup process slowly, he gave me whole bunch of instructions quickly as if I were some kind of computer expert. When I tried to ask questions to confirm his instruction, he answered ""ya ya ya"" and made comments relly made me feel stupid. I'm not sure if I ever will buy another D-Link product if I had to go through another rude tech support."
1,Bad bad router,"The worst piece of hardware I've ever bought! Even having the latest firmware in it, it just wont work right. Keeps lagging the connection and now D-link has discontinued the product. Just don't buy it. Buy something from linksys instead."
2,Whimpy,Works good on short distance but not for the long haul. 30 foot ok 50 I wouldn't count on it.
4,"Not perfect, but very pleased overall","I purchased the DI-624 (rev. B) router, primarily based on a price and dealer recommendation (the router was the same price as the Linksys unit, but the PCI card and notebook cards were both $20 bucks less). I was a little dismayed at first. Upon installation of both wireless cards and the corresponding software for all three pieces of hardware, I was unable to connect to the internet through either machine. However, I called D-Link technical service, and was actually connected to a real person within 5 to 7 minutes (note: this was during the usual 5pm to 7pm high usage period). The tech was able to correct the problems within 10 minutes. So far performance has been comparable to the speed that I was experiencing when hardwired directly to my cable modem. I do not have any experience with any other home-user based wireless set-ups, but I would not hesitate to recommend D-Link to anyone who is looking for a cost effective wireless set-up."
2,"Reboots constantly, static DHCP doesn't work","I'm terribly disappointed with this router. It reboots whenever there is interference due to a cordless phone, causing all connected devices (including those using an ethernet cable) to lose their connections. It ""forgets"" about machines on the network, seemingly at random, so you have to unplug the router and plug it back in to get your network connection back. And the static DHCP that's supposed to be in the latest firmware doesn't seem to work at all. When I enabled it, it refused to give the static IP address to the machine I selected."
1,Piece of Junk,"I chose D-Link because of their customer support 24/7 for the life of the product. I have gone through 2 DI-624. DSL and Cable Modem (Road Runner). It keeps DROPPING THE SIGNAL. From reading another review, its true that the firmware updates are what kills this router. Each update creates new problems. Everyone tells me to use Linksys and I am getting one now... PS I have used D-Link for over 3 yrs!"
1,Don't Waste your time or money,"This unit is terrible, its poorly made, cheap does not work well with Macintosh computers and the tech-support is terrible! The tech support - barely speaks english, is difficult to understand and the phone connections are awful - made me wonder why they even offer tech support. Trust me this is not a good product."
1,"Lots of reboots, poor firmware upgrades, you can do better","There's a good reason this router is so cheap. I agree with the other reviewers who have noticed that this router frequently either reboots itself or hangs and requires the user to unplug it and plug it back in. Even the firmware ""upgrades"" require you to completely shut the router down and wait 1 min and then plug back in, and hope it works... last upgrade I had to do this 5 times and finally it came back to life. I previously had a Linksys router and in retrospect wish I had stayed with that brand, though it wasn't perfect.Suggest you search on google and find some recommendations for a good, stable router."
5,Best Router Ever!,"OK this might have been my only router I've ever owned, but it is the best. I had a constant problem with my Internet disconnecting and thought it was the router, so I upgraded the firmware, reset, and called tech support. They helped my troubleshoot and found that it was my cable modem that was causing the problem. I was relieved that it wasn't this D-Link router.So my cable company replaced the modem, and now everything works great!Thanks for the reliability D-Link!"
1,Stay away from this piece of junk,"When it works, it works fine. Otherwise, the continual dropping of its Internet connection is a royal pain. Absolutely no reason for that to happen. Update the firmware? How about this D-Link: why don't you fix the problem in the first place before you sell it? You're so fired."
2,Definitely a.... NOT BUY,"I purchased this router yesterday (from the date of this review). I was thinking to myself this is going to be a great router to keep the network going for a long time. Boy, was I wrong (and an idiot). Every spare moment I got I worked on getting this running. Others have written 6 hours and then 5 min with the tech support. Trust me, it aint 5 min its 1 1/2 hours of my life that i can never get back. And besides, why does a product always need tech support....c mon dlink make it easy. Personally unless your a ""computer networking genius"" stay clear of this one. And dont, if you do buy a router,get the fastest one because on my computers 60 percent is has high as it goes even 5 feet away from the router. Think what you want to....my opinion on this product....dont buy.... try a microsoft or netgear.-Later"
1,Lasted 5 days...,"The other negative reviews are CORRECT on this one; after 3 days of use, it began faltering (""Network cable disconnected"" message in Windows). It has now failed completely. The TS guys in New Delhi are of no help whatsoever. Avoid!"
1,Continously Rebooting !!!!!,Yes this Dlink product is notorious with rebooting problemas more users connect to the WLAN. Maybe 1 or 2 is not.But more than 5 then this Wireless Router starts rebooting.Also it's gonna get warm faster than you think.Dlink is cheap. And you get what you pay for.PS. To Dlink Company: When are you going to remodel the ugly
3,Poor signal quality - not recommended,"I have an old Netgear MR814 rev. A that is 802.11b and I wanted to upgrade to 802.11g. I decided to get a DI-624 since the review was good on CNET. Sorry to say my review isn't as good. This router just didn't have as strong a signal as my ancient Netgear. I thought for sure the technology had improved since my last purchase. Maybe DLink sacrificed speed for reliability, but I think that's a mistake. The features provided in this router are good, but the signal quality just isn't up to snuff. I did upgrade to the latest firmware at the time 2.50, but that didn't help. I don't recommend this router."
1,Horrible Router and Support,I purchased my router a few months ago and i have this rebooting problem and its to the point it happens every 30 secs to 5 min. i called tech support and they are absoulutly no help and just make it worse.
2,Dlink software support is horrible,"Be aware that if you buy this product, the Dlink firmware has historically been released full of bugs that are not frequently corrected. I am looking at Linksys or other routers to replace this one because of firmware bugs when using WPA encryption.Recently, Dlink released firmware 2.45 and then after many complaints, added a note to their site stating that it is a beta version. I would think that a company that had solid firmware would not have to go back and change a released version of firmware to beta."
2,I got owned,"Pros : Easy to setup, looks niceCons : Doesn't really workUgh, why didn't I read about the insipid disconnection problem of this router BEFORE I bought it??Save yourself the trouble and don't get this thing. Even with the latest firmware, and various tweaks to the router settings, I still lose connection randomly. And it's not just the wireless connection! Even my desktop and its CAT5 line will get dropped from time to time WITHOUT WARNING.There is a ton of people with the same problem, and D-LINK knows it. Check out broadbandreports.com and save yourself the hassle."
4,D-Link DI-624 AirPlus Xtreme G,"This is a good by, especially with the rebate!I started out with the Microsoft MN-610, which is only 802.11b, but returned it to purchase this. For about $20 more, I was able to purchase this 802.11b & 802.11g compatible router.Router was very easy to set up. My only complaint is that I cannot figure out any method to stop broadcasting the SSID-this seems like it would help secure the system. Also, WEP should be enabled by default."
2,D-link is garbage wrt quality,"Just plain crapped out after 6mos. Always needed resetting even a few months ago, now just wont work. Replaced with netgears most basic 802.11g and it solved all my issues."
2,Keep dropping my internet connection,"It is fine when I use wireless w/o wep encryption. (although when I transfer files between two computers using this router, wireless lan is disconnected after few MB of transfer)I can surf web for long, and play counter strike w/o much of lag.But when I enable 64bits wep (128bits also available), it drop my connection after few minutes.So it keep ask me if I want to connect to available wireless network every 2~3minutes.And Of course, if I was downloading some files, then I get disconnected. I had to re-download that again.I can use it w/o wep enabled, but I don't want other people stealing my bandwidth, so I'm going to return this and pay $20 more to get linksys"
5,Like a Charm...,"I recently installed the DWL-G650 into my two year old laptop equipped with XP. Connected to the cable modem is a 5 year old HP running windows 98 which is also attached to the DI-624 wireless access point. Both my laptop and the PC are getting great speeds; the PC has achieved 1.9Mbs (average about 1.4Mbs) and my laptop 1.6Mbs (1.2Mbs average). Absolutely at the top of my list for the easiest setup for computer ""periferals"" (sp?) I live in an apartment, so the need for range is not an issue (and I infact havn't tested that aspect) though I doubt the D-Link devices would not do great. Very satisfied."
1,POOR PRODUCT - WARNING BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK,I am the IT Manager for my company and we purchased several of the DI-624 routers for our remote offices. Despite repeated resets and upgrading of the firmware they peform poorly and are unreliable. Save your money and consider buying the LINKSYS WRT54G or WRT54GS. I have purchased 6 of the WRT54G's as replacement routers and have not run into a single problem. They are amazing! If you do your research on the DI-624 you will see that most reviews show this to be an inconsistent product. Technical support at DLINK is not helpful.
5,Awesome new firmware with new features,"With the newest firmware released a week or two ago I now have cable testing software. I can check and see if the cables that are connected to my router are good and not faulty. This will also show where the fault in the cable is up to a meter of accuracy.I am impressed with the performance of this router even though it only has one antenna. In fact I think I get better range with this one antenna than my friend does with a different brand that has 2 antennas. The speeds are fast enough for me, not sure exactly how fast that is, but I have no problems playing MP3 files off my PC on my wireless laptop, or web surfing, or even gaming.I am impressed with this router and glad I got it on sale.Thanks D-Link!"
3,"Excellent Router, After You Fix It","A lot of the reviewers here complain of dropped connections, router resets etc. and I had the same troubles when I first got mine. However, the resets and drops were due to a buggy version of firmware, and simply going to the D-Link website and grabbing the latest firmware and installing it on the router took care of all of my problems.While it is generally unacceptable for a router to ship with such buggy firmware, if you give it a little bit of time and effort (minimal really) you'll get a rock-solid wireless router for a good price."
4,Gets the job done,"I had a Belkin 54Mbps router and took it back because it didn't have the range I needed. At about 30' away, it was losing connection with four different wireless cards.So, I got an Airlink 108Mbps rounter and took it back because I didn't like the software inside of it. On the other hand, it had the range I needed.So, I bought a Belkin 125Mbps. Again, same user friendly software and firewall, but no range. So, back it went.On the suggestion of a friend who is a network administrator with a wireless phone service provider, I got the D-Link. The price is better than the Belkin, the software is almost as good, and it has the range of the Airlink.The D-Link is staying."
1,Low price for faulty hardware = waste of money,"EDIT: After a firmware upgrade, the unit is working far better, and has been in use for about 3 months at my residence. Still, it drops out intermittently, and there are better choices.(1) Drops connections - a lot.(2) Many - hundreds of websites - report the same problem.(3) D-Link hired lots of marketers to write good opinions of this device. Don't trust them.(4) I know what I'm doing. I've set up my computer on literally a dozen different networks without a problem, and configured routers of various stripes for almost a decade. This isn't a newbie error - I was floored for many hours trying to get this thing to work.(5) It still doesn't work reliably.(6) This issue isn't a 'bad unit' issue - many other people sent in their D-Link routers, got a new one, and had exactly the same problem.Bottom line: one of the worst purchases I have made -- and I know what I'm doing. AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
3,The Power Supply Is This Product's Achille's Heal,"D-Link DI-624 Air Plus XtremeG Wireless 108G RouterThis unit worked fine until the power supply failed. D-Link does not sell replacement power supplies.After checking multiple online sellers and local/national stores, the closest replacement power supply, though higher quality, costs the same as a new router.Would be willing to pay more for a solution that has reliable components. Time has a value to it. The trouble must be that few other people take this view, there is only a market for cheap, unreliable components to bring the price in line with all the other vendors selling the ""same"" item.I did buy another router, as perhaps all the router manufacturers would like us to do, but this is quite wasteful in this day and age, would you agree?"
3,Poor documentation and a few bugs,"It took an unusally long amount of time to set this router up. The documentation is rather poor; it covers the basics that most people need to know, but has no in-depth information on ""what it all means."" I already had a 2-Wire router and I just wanted to use the D-Link router as a bridge so that I could add some wireless devices to my network. Finally I figured out that I had to turn off the DHCP server on the D-Link and assign it a static IP address on the same network as the 2-Wire. It took a long time because the user interface is very poorly laid out and is very anti-intuitive. Most people won't notice this because they'll just run the ""Wizard"" and be done. But for advanced setup you might have to spend quite a bit of time trying all the different settings and cursing to yourself.Another problem is that every time you turn off the router the date and time get reset to the year 2002, and the automatic time-set feature using NTP doesn't work at all."
1,Drops connections periodically - AVOID!!!!!,"This router frequently drops connection (a little window saying a network connection has been unplugged pops up).After searching the net I found that it is an extremely common problem and as of yet, there is no fix.It's usually for only a second or few but if you are in the middle of a transfer or if you are gaming, it's really annoying.I would not buy this router again."
5,Great Start for 802.11g and it Can Only Get Better From Here,"I have this DI-624, a DWL-G650(802.11g CardBus), and a DWL-650+(802.11b+ CardBus). Everything is working great for me. I get good range and good speeds at those ranges. My wife uses the DWL-650+ in her laptop and I use the DWL-G650 in mine. We both get great range in our home, every room is covered. The speeds are more than enough for web browsing, playing games online, and your everyday normal network traffic.The setup of this router and these cards were very simple and had easy to follow directions to go along with them. The router's setup was equally simple. It had a simple setup wizard that guides you through the steps needed to get up and running properly."
2,just wasn't worth it,"Initially the system worked fine, the Network Card connected everytime and the firewall worked great. I had WEP and MAC filtering enabled (at the time the most security I could get for wireless). I took the laptop on a trip, and when I returned, nothing worked. I had to literally strip out all of the security settings and then slowly re-enable them. The laptop would at times drop off the network, not connect, do things that made no sense, since none of the settings had changed. Also their customer support wasn't at times the best of help either, they replied always by email, but it took two-three days for a reply. It just became too frustrating."
1,BAD,"The worst router that I ever use! Super unstable, bad customer service. They are unwilling to repair/exchange/refund their defective product. The tech support only asked me to follow their troubleshoot procedure. However, it wasn't to fix the problem even I followed their procedures for three times! D-Link: I am not purchasing the product for troubleshooting. At the end, I got a new Netgear router. This brand is much better and much stable. Get a Netgear router! It is much cheaper and much better."
4,"Very good. It's basic, but works fine.",Nice product. It has the basic functions and I already connected 3 wireless devices and it is working fine. No delays at all. The range is fine. I live in a 2 store house and it works on the second floor. When I go downstairs it does work but no more than through 2 walls.
1,Lots of features but lots of problems,"This product is actually the DI-624 Rev C. It's a wireless router with an adjustable antenna, four 100 mbps LAN ports, and one 100 mbps WAN port. It has a pretty great feature set. I use the PPPoE support, DHCP server, WPA encryption, DNS and MAC based filtering, and the integrated IP firewall. All this is controlled through a relatively decent web interface.The problem that I and MANY others have had is with the stability of the device. It has a number of nasty habits; like dropping the WAN connection then being unable to reconnect, stalling immediately after it receives a DHCP lease request, or spontaneously rebooting. These problems are intermittent which only adds to the frustration you feel when they occur. The tech support will have you do flash updates and careful reset and reconfig procedures. These don't help. Because of these stability problems, I strongly recommend against buying this product."
1,DI-624 drops WIRED connections,"Used with Windows XP media center ed. Worked fine for 3 months and then started dropping connections every 1/2 hour. And I was WIRED, not wireless. Tech support was worst I have ever experienced."
4,Generally a good performer,"This was my first wireless router at home. It was fairly easy to set up, although the setup utility was a bit difficult to navigate at first. The performance has been good, except for occasional dropped connections."
1,Do not buy.,"This was an awful experience. The first day we got it, we just used the land-line, and not the wireless. Every few minutes it would disconnect and re-connect spontaneously. We called D-Link support, got about a dozen people who knew nothing about the product at all, and eventually decided to drop it. The ""solutions"" they gave us did nothing at all. Once we tried using the wireless, the problems persisted, but in a different way. Instead of every few minutes, the dropped connections only happened a few times a day. However, the ""blackouts"" of information, within 3 feet of the router, lasted for prolonged periods of time, from 10-20 minutes. Nobody could do anything to help us. We're hopefully going to return it soon for a Netgear."
3,"Good, router if you do not need RDP","This router has been working perfectly until I needed to vpn and RDP into my office desktop. I cannot use Remote Desktop Connection behind this router I followed the manufacturer instructions to open the RDP port, but that didn't work. I found the same complain about this router on a number of mailing lists. None of the users were able to use RDP behind this router.So I'm going to buy a Linksys router to be able to connect to my office."
2,Not Recommended,"This router would probably work fine for a simple home network or internet sharing, but it almost worthless for gaming. I wish I would have done more research before I bought it, seems a large percentage of people have the same problem as I do with it.With the original firmware it will reboot itself at random times, most of the time killing any connections I had up, games and file transfers didn't stand a chance. With ""updated"" firmware it only got worse for me. Instead of random reboots, I got reboots on about a 20 or 30 second schedule continuously. Completely unacceptable for anything but basic internet sharing."
2,Disconnect many time,"I found that many reviewer above like this router. For if i have a chance to change it, i will. I don't know why it is disconnect many time after i turn on the router and use around 10 minute. First i suspect that the problem came from my internal wireless network in my tablet pc. But today, i know the true. I try to test many machine and they could not use an internet after they connect to this round around 10 minute. Beside my house there is a school and they have a wireless internet connection. I do not know which router product that they use but my computer could detect its signal every time that i open the computer from the morning until night. Whether i could not use the internet because not SSID key but i know the school has a good router while this router is just far from my laptop around 10 meter but always disconnect every 10 minutes. I suggest any people that purchase this product at the store should test it first before decide to purchase product."
4,difficult installation unless you call toll free number for help,The unit seems to work very well but installation using CD rom which came in the box with the wireless router was of no help when I tried to install it at a university dorm where internet was available without a modem. The rep at the toll free number was very helpful and patient and helped set up the router and the encryption key for security. The interent connection at 100 Mbps was super fast.
4,"Easy to setup, Works Well, Runs Hot","I puchased the DI-624 after owning a D-Link wired router. The customer service isn't the best, but I have had very little problem with the previous router or this one. I have been using the DI-624 for about a month now. It has worked perfectly. It is easy to install as well.The only issue I have with the router is that it runs a little hot. I'm not sure if this will cause problems down the road, but it is something worth noting.Overall... Good product for a good price"
4,Excelent Router,I think this is an excelent router i recomended a lot i give it 4 stras because at thebegining i used to have the reebot problems but then i just run the wizard once and it wasll all great.It has an excelent speed and stability also has a very good range.
1,UNRELIABLE ON TWO DIFFERENT UNITS,"I went wireless using DI-624. It took a long time working with a phone tech to get it set up. Wonderful customer service, but it took over an hour. Then I had wireless! It was incredible for three months. Until it quit working. Ninety minutes with their customer service reveakled the unit was broken. They encouraged me tio send it back. They replaced it. Three months of wonderful wireless. Now the second unit is broken.I am moving over to Linksys. Wish me luck!"
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this router for its wireless capability and to replace my old router. This router is a real bag of troubles. It would randomly disconnect the wireless connection from my laptop, and sometimes, it would drop the entire network when the wireless connection attempts to connect. I had to go into the router admin menu and turn off the wireless feature(router reboots), then turn it back on(router reboots again); why? I don't know, It just works after that(Note: Just rebooting the router does not help.). After weeks of trials and error, I ended up buying a Linksys and kept this one as a spare. The router works great WITHOUT the wireless feature, but that was not the original purpose of my purchase. Buy it if you want a challenge of troubleshooting, but avoid it if you want a reliable router."
3,Still disappointed....,"I had the first generation Dlink DI614+ which worked nicely except for the reboot/lost connection problem whenever there's heavy traffic when I run more than one P2P programs, upgraded to the 624 router and the DWL-G650 PC card, same problem, also the WPA-PSK feature is flaky and when you have this security turned on and you lose connection due to heavy traffic it's a b*tch to get the DWL-G650 to talk to the router again, I essentially had to go back to the old driver (for the DWL-g650) on the CD (2.36 I think) and use WEP instead of WAP-PSKIf you don;t do any heavy P2P downloading this router should be fine for surfing and light P2P downloadingI hope they will fix the firmware soon other than that the router has nice features and easy enough to configure (for me at least and I work in the IT industry)"
1,dlink sucks,i am so disappointed because tech support was unhelpful. they could not get my laptap wireless running they blamed on my laptap. i was using smc wireless perfectly except its speed up to 54mbps.
1,Terrible,"Opted to try this router after frying out two Linky's over two years. Thought that I should be getting a longer usable life than I had been getting. Bought the D-Link 624 as replacement - huge mistake. This router drops the signal constantly, the firmware update makes almost no difference. Check of other web-reviews confirms this is a common, unfixable problem for the router. Do not buy."
3,Fine if you're just using it to share an internet connection,"The router can be configured for what Dlink calls ""virtual server"". But I have yet to be able to get this feature to work. Calls to support is worthless. As far as routing and wireless, I've had no issues with that. But don't purchase this if you plan on running a web server behind this box."
5,very satisfied,"I am using the router with a DWL-G650 card which I bought at the same time. The setup was easy...I followed the quick installation guides for both products. To get the full 108MB transfer speed I had to download updated drivers for the DWL-G650. I needed to know how to update drivers by going to WinXP System/Hardware Tab in Control panel. The installed firmware on the router is version 2.28, which works fine. IMPORTANT: Check your firmware and drivers are up to date (this is explained on the D-Link website) or you will be frustrated in getting full speed. One should be comfortable with computers before attempting to set this router/wireless card combo up. However, there were no unforeseen difficulties and I can't imagine it being easier.The D-Link support website is EXCELLENT and highly recommended. Check it out support.dlink.com before you buy!"
1,Tech Support clueless,"I called Tech Support and they do not know their product. First they claim that the antenna on the DI624 can not be detached. When confronted with their website saying otherwise they say: ""yes it is"". Then they refer to pre-sales because ""they know"" and decline to answer anymore questions."
1,Poor hardwired network performance,"Bought this router because of some good reviews that I had seen for the wireless features (108)....But I also wanted to use it to connect some wired PCs to our broadband connection. After using it for a short while, the router seemed to lose the hardwired connections as if the router had rebooted..this increased in frequency to the point it became unbearable...D-link suggested flashing old firmware (but the link to the old firware is dead and the latest beta firware does not fix this problem).... Do a search on Google for ""DI-624 reboot"" and you will see that I am not alone with this problem. Going to return and purchase another brand."
1,The Missing Link,"I have had this router for 5 months. It will drop the wireless connection at random. So, I will be in the middle of something online then I am not online anymore. I have tried to work with D-Link tech support but they do not have an answer. It is not worth the money for this product.You will be missing your link and missing your money."
2,U are forced to use Encryption to do Access Control (bad),"If u want to keep others from using ur router u HAVE TO use encryption [with a key] on this router to keep them out. Found this out through Dlink tech support. Other routers (Netgear, Linksys, etc) can do Wireless Access Control with MAC addresses or encryption. Use both if u want really secure control.Well, I don't want to bother with encryption and I don't want other ppl using my router. Can't do that with this router. I wish I had known this b4 I bought the DI-624.The indicator light interface in the front is very primitive. They are small, and blinking means normal. Usually blinking or a different color signals something is WRONG. There's only one colour. Kinda counter-intuitive.The latest e-manual is outdated and does little explaination of the features."
1,This product is defective.,"The revision A and B of this product is defective; revision A/B has two antennas, this revision cannot be updated to the latest firmware and has physical defects which make it operate at sub-par performance, not even a fourth of what was advertised. This is a fact and can be found on d-link's website. If you buy this, dont be sucked in by the revision A/B's two antennas, and larger packaging. Get the revision C which has one antenna, and smaller packaging. I am a victim of this trap.*** Update ***- At the time of this reviews writing I worked for D-Link, now I do not. The above review is an insiders perspective of a product I was forced to support."
2,mixed results,"I dread hearing my kids walk down the stairs lately, usually it means""dad, we're offline again."" I have to unplug this router at least every other day, and now my wireless printer won't work thru it, even wired to it. Very unhapppy, think I'll return it."
1,Piece of Garbage,"I bought this and the matching card for my laptop. THey've worked around 20% of the time, and the amount of agony they have put me through is extreme. The laptop card was the worst, but the router is almost as bad. Bad software, difficult to use, and one problem after another.One of the multitude of times I talked to tech support, the technician actually told me I should have bought from a different company! First time I've ever heard that. Sadly, I give up. I'm now going to take his advice. My only question is whether I repeatedly hit the dlink with a hammer and throw it away (which would be extremely catharctic), or donate it to someone to make their life miserable.I will never buy another dlink product. (Though for what its worth, their tech support did try to be helpful. They couldn't get it to work either)I'm off to buy a linksys. I hope I have better luck."
1,******** CONSTANT REBOOT PROBLEMS!!!!! ****************,I do NOT recommend this router. It appears that Amazon has a bad batch of routers. I went through two units only to realize the problem was systemic. I would get constant reboot errors causing all wired and wireless devices to lose connectivity. I upgraded the firmware and still no avail. Do a search on google for yourself and you'll see that many people are experiencing the same issue. I recommend that you save yourself some headaches and go with Linksys or Netgear.
2,Frecuently Disconnect,"I bought this product 2 weeks ago... With firmware 4.0 I got disconnection every 5-15 minutes. I upgraded the firmware to 4.03 and the connection is better, but is not enough... I have a network with a wireless laptop and wireless desktop, when both are connected, the disconnection is every 10-20 minutes. I don't recommend this product.If you search in network forums, you founded with the problem is very common.I'm waiting for a new firmware, it could be my solution."
5,Great Router,"I have used this for 2 years with a cable modem. The ethernet from the cable modem is routed through this device to provide internet to the non-wireless desktop. I use the wireless for my laptop, and it works well with both pcs and macs. The signal strength is good, but I keep the router antenna pointed out toward the main part of the house. I can pick up a strong signal upstairs, at the other end of the house, and outside. My connection is always as fast as I can get anywhere else (school, work, library, etc.), and my modem and cable service are basic. I have no complaints with this router, and it does everything I expect it to do with no trouble."
2,Don't buy it.,"- The wireless range of this router in my house barely made it past 3 small rooms (about 40 ft)- This router frequently drops its wireless connection, and will sometimes reboot itself when both the wireless and wired connections are in use.- Latest firmware upgrade (v2.76) for this router locks out Xbox Live.Be prepared to open ports or use v2.75- The interface for advanced features (firewall ports, MAC filtering) is a bit clunky.I switched to a Linksys WRT54G. Much better range, and so far, no dropped connections."
3,WPA encryption does not work,"D-Link's technician told me the DI-624c does not work with WPA encryption. He claims that future firmware will support WPA, but for now the WPA mode is ""unstable"". He had me set it up with WEP encryption.I feel a little gypped, since D-Link advertises WPA on their website and I expected WPA when I purchased it. (I'm using firmware version 2.70 - dated 8/31/05.)"
5,Easy Easy Easy and Super Super Fast:),I purchased this with my new HP notebook with intergrated 802.11G. I was up and surfing with no wires within 20 minutes and this included upgrading my notebook wireless card!!! This product blows away my old linksys 802.11b access point.
1,"Poor Quality, permanently defective product line. AVOID!","The DI-624 product line is completely defective.Do yourself a favor and search google for 'DI-624 reboot'I have gone through 3 units, and each one of them exhibits the same problem. They stay connected to the internet for a while - sometimes a day, sometimes only 10 minutes at a time - and then spontaneously reboot, causing loss of internet connection for ~10 seconds, a re-connect with my ISP, which results in a new IP address.I have filed a Better Business Bureau report against D-Link, and I have spent months, actually months, trying to get a product exchange for a different model router.I would avoid this router.I have had great success with D-Link routers in the past. I had one function for two years buried under cables and dust without a glitch.The DI-624 seems unique in it's fatal problems."
5,User Friendly For the Novice w/ Power+++,"At first I was a bit ambivalent to having my home unwired and go the wireless route:) It thought I would be more of a hassle not worth the expense. After purchasing D-link's DI-624, Two PCI cards, and two laptop cards, I wish I had do so earlier. Every step was very easy w/ software and scanning tools to make sure I was up and running. Did not experience any problems even when I set the encrypt. , I strong recommend this (Set your WEP) for added security especially in apartment complexes b/c I could scan and pick-up other networks. Great price and cool!!!"
2,Refurbushed D-Link DI-624,"The Router works but the it doesn't work properly. Both computers disconnects frequently while on line only. When I do not use the router, the main computer stays connected while on line perfectly. I should have probably purchased the router new instead of used. I am looking at the router right now and I can not use it! Sorry for the not so well review!"
3,"Reliable, but the range could be better","This is a solid, dependable WiFi router. I found the instructions to set up a password were nonexistent and the web interface was not all that user-friendly, but fortunately phone help resolved it. I wish mine had as good a range as others here, but so many factors influence that, I can't fault d-link. I did get an antenna booster, the D-Link ANT 24-0700, which boosts the range a lot, but not enough for me! In all, it has worked for almost two years, so I can't complain ..."
2,broke after about a month,"This router worked ok for about a month and then failed when I was in the admin page.Still kinda works, but I can no longer get into the admin page, and it takes forever to boot the router. I tried resetting it to factory defaults, but it doesnt respond to the switch.I was happy with it when it worked, but it failed too fast to be satisfactory. I went and bought another one however."
2,Nice features but lots of connection drops,"I wish I read all these reviews before buying this bad product.I am having a lot of connection drops for both wired and wireless connections. Upgrading to the newest firmware didn't help it at all. I even think it became worse after the upgrade.I don't write product reviews at all, but I decided to write my first review.Just an hour ago, I tried to send a 10MB file to my friend over ICQ, and I gave it up after having 3 connection drops.On the good side, it is easy to setup and it comes with some good features like MAC cloning, firewall etc.I tried to set a DMZ to one of my machines without much luck.I'm sending it back."
1,Low signal strength,"I purchased this router with the DLink DWL-G132 USB adapter. I could achieve a ""Good"" signal (3 out of 5 bars) when located in the same room with the router. At a distance of 20 feet, the signal strength fell to low. At my target location the signal was ""Very Low"" or dropped. I tried various configurations, and even purchased a high gain antenna, but the signal never improved. I replaced it with a Linksys router (WRT54GS) using the same adapter and the signal was ""Excellent"" (5 of 5 bars) in the same room and in my target location, the signal was ""Very Good""."
2,3 Story Home and it works in every room,"This is my first wireless Router. I like the freedom that it gives me. I can take my laptop anywhere in my home,on the porch and even down the block. It does seem to need rebooting more than my wired router but, I'm getting good at reseting it. It disconnects all the time. I would NOT recommend this router to others."
5,"Excellent router, but read the manual.","This is probably the best value router for the price that you can buy. I've been a network administrator for 5 years, and this was a dream to set up. It has all the features I need and then some, and worked great right out of the box. I haven't had any problems with signal loss or session timeouts, which is a big improvement over the Linksys model I had before.One warning: you absolutely must read the entire manual before starting. Particularly if you're not very familiar with wireless networking. The setup utility is web-based and quite easy to use, but you have to take the time to learn what each option controls -- for the sake of security if nothing else."
1,This is the worst router of all time,"This is a horrible device. I have personal experience with 2 of this model and they are both defective in different ways. One drops network connections (on the wired switch portion even... how hard is it to get a wired switch right?) on a fairly regular basis for no explicable reason only to reconnect a fraction of a second later. The other has a wireless radio that works for about an hour or two then stops working and the router needs to be reset in order to get it working again (for another hour or two).This is literally the worst networking device I have ever used, and that goes back to the old days of 10base2. You would be better off making your own router out of gum wrappers and paper clips. It would be at least as reliable."
2,Good but lots of problens,"I recently brought a DI-624 Rev C. In the begining it worked greatly. However, after 2 days, it became to show instabillities.I used to use it as a PPPoE to conect to my broad band and sometimes I experience some dropping in the WAN conection and them problens to reconect. To bypass this dificulty I have to set up my modem to conect the internet and them set the DI-624 to conect my modem...Even after I do this procedure, the problem persists but now I do not have trouble to reconect the internet since the moden does not disconect.Thus, I do not recommend this product wile these problens continue to persist."
3,Not the right upgrade for us.,"We currently use an older Microsoft MN500 wireless router, which has been a bit disappointing to us. Our main need is to get reception in the basement, and the MN500 just wasn't giving good coverage. So we decided to get a new ""G"" unit and hope for better speed and coverage.The good news: installed fairly easily, and the tech-help was helpful. We sorted things out and had it up and running in about 45 minutes.The bad news: using our existing 11b receivers, there was a slight slowdown in speed. And the broadcast strength is about equal to the MN500.We're taking it back to the store.If you want this , you probably should be upgrading to 11g all around, and you shouldn't be trying to broadcast a signal very far."
2,"Good for shared Internet access, bad for the home network","I purchased this router hoping to share our DSL connection across our three computers, and share a networked printer.While set-up was flawless and the Wireless connection worked out of the box, we were not able to connect to any computers within our home network. After speaking with customer support they stated that the router does not support computers connecting to each-other, nor shared printers within the local network.Needless to say, this is going back to the store."
2,"Great w/ G650, bad with everything else","I bought this product and had great speeds w/ the G-650 PCMCIA card attached. However, I also wanted an external antenna to get better range so I bought D-link's 120 USB network adapter. After wasting a Saturday night with tech support for over 2 hours, I finally realized the DI-624 does not work with 802.11b, even it's own products. My adapter kept connecting, then after 1 second, disconnecting. Tech support claimed that I needed to slow down my router so my 802.11b adapter could read it. However, there is no way to slow down the router to do this in the first place!"
1,Damaged item,This item arrived damaged and for this reason I decided to return it because I was scare to receive another damaged wireless router in case I decided to change it for another router. I really didn't like all the money I had to spent.
2,DI-624 AND DWL-650,"I DID FOLLOW ALL THE RECOMENDATION BASE ON THEIR WEBPAGE IN HOW TO INSTALL THE SYSTEM. THE EQUIPMENT IS GOOD. HOWEVER THE SIGNAL OF THE EQUIPMENT IS VERY WEAK. I DID CONTACT THEIR TECH SUPPORT, BUT THE SITUATION WAS WORSE. BETWEEN 5 TO 7 FEET FROM THE BASE, I DID HAVE VERY GOOD SINAL, ONES A WAS MORE THAN 10 FEET FROM THE BASE SIGNAL WAS GOING LOW OR VERY LOW. I DID HAVE COMPAQ BEFORE AND THEIR SIGNAL WAS BETTER BUT THEIR EQUIPEMENT WAS BAD. TRY TO LOOK OTHER EQUIPMENT I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE."
2,Don't buy anything from Dlink,"This was a good router for almost 3 years, then it just stopped working one day. It froze up and the manual reset did nothing. The lights came on but I didnt have anything plugged in. It would not network LAN or send internet. All functions entirely DEAD. I think I'm not going to even try to get a replacement, but will buy a linksys or something. Pissed that I don't have wireless internet right now."
1,Persistent rebooting is a real nightmare,"I bought this product as part of a package with a D-Link 108 pci card. It was easy to set up, and appeared to work well until it began regularly rebooting. A lot of people have had this problem and I had to search for a solution. I tried firmware updates and disabling features, but it didn't help.This router is a bit dodgy. I did eventually find what I believe is a solution to the rebooting problem (...)that is working for me so far. But, all in all it has been a very disappointing experience. There is an obvious disparity between its excellent reviews such as on CNet and those numerous reviews by users having experienced problems with the device. This router has a lot of features, which attracted me to it in the first place, but isn't worth the trouble."
1,Frequent spontaneous reboots.,"The wireless connection drops at least once an hour for 30 seconds, disrupting web surfing, internet game play, and large file downloads.I've had these problems with PCs running Windows XP and 98 using D-Link and Microsoft 802.11g wireless cards.Also, it is impossible for computers hooked to the wired LAN to communicate with those on the wireless one, and vice versa.I'm running the absolute latest firmware on the access point and the latest firmware and drivers on the wireless cards.This thing is garbage, don't buy it."
2,"Umm, this doesn't _work_.","I guess if you're satisfied with an open 802.11g configuration then you're set. Otherwise, steer clear of this pile.Let's see:WPA-PSK does not work. It worked for a few hours then randomly stopped working. Not sure if it's the router or the D-LINK XtremeG cardbus card. Other people have the same issue.The web interface is dog slow from one of the wired ports for no apparent reason. Works fine over wireless.This is a treat: I just tried to enable WEP from my wired desktop, and the router REBOOTS. I don't even 'apply' the setting, I just click ""enabled"" and my network drops and the POS reboots.Steer clear, wish I had."
4,Good product,"Works as it should, no problems with so far and will continue to use or buy another if this one fails."
3,D-Link,This was a very good purchase for an experienced user since I did have to know about the setup and downloading the software that didn't come in the box.
1,"Bad brand for Wireless, do not buy Linksys","For the las 4 year i had 2 DI-614, 1 DI-514, 4 DI-624 and DI-784 (a/b/g) and all are dead!!!!! do not buy D-link if you are going to use your router a lot!!! after 6 to 12 months of heavy use you will get a lot of problem.... d-link support suc***s5 stars guys you will see it :-)PS: buy a Linksys or Buffalo"
1,Lousy product - Don't buy this,I replaced my Netgear B router with this one - what a mistake! The connection drops always. I upgraded my firmware by 2 versions. Nothing helps. Netgear used to work like a charm. There is no reason for the connection to drop. I couldnt connect my laptops w/o interruptions.Buy any other product other than this. I would recommend NetGear. I am going to get NetGear for myself.
1,Ripoff,"I bought this product from Best Buy about a year and a half ago; my family got cable and a wired network just wasn't feasible with our layout, so we went with this D-Link device.Connection drops every few minutes, and sometimes it won't come back up until the router is rebooted...which requires unplugging the router and the modem, then putting them through their boot cycles one at a time. When it works its best we do this every other day, at its worst we do it daily; today it had to be rebooted three times in one hour.I've tried multiple connection devices, DWL 122, DWL G650, DWL G520, and whatever one came built into my sister's Dell. Getting closer to the router hasn't helped; it still even dropped packets. (As an example, an instant message or two may simply never reach me.)Needless to say, my family's looking for something new since their tech support's suggestions were useless."
1,108 Mbps is NOT working,"I use DI-624 and DWL-650 with Dell 600m. The 108 Mbps or Super G just doesn't work, the wireless connection drops every 10-20 min. Make sure you visit http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum and search for paeDISCONNECTED and you will meet many unhappy users there. I have tried both 2.42 and 2.50 firmware and many things suggested in http://www.broadbandreports.com/forum. The only way to make DI-624 and DWL-650 work for me is to disable Super G. DI-624 also works with my 802.11b came with Dell 600m."
2,Buy another router-unstable connections,"DI-624 router frequently disconnects itself from all computers, wired and wireless, attached to it. What's more, it will reboot and might take up to 5 minutes to establish a connection, which may happen in the middle of a download.D-link suggests that you downgrade the speed to 10Mb which will reduce files transfer speed in your network by a tenfold. But the issue is not resolve. Upgrading to new firmware (2.50)won't resolve the issue either. Furthermore, replacing the network card for a new one won't resolve the issue.If you want to spend many hours fussing, calling & e-mailing tech support and rebooting a router and reconfiguring it until you are red in the face....go for it..."
2,rather weak product on all fronts,"I bought two of these routers to use in a spread-out, single-floor residential setting with a mixed Mac/PC environment. I figured I could locate them at opposite ends of the house for good and, hopefully, overlapping coverage. Not so.Firstly, these devices will eventually drop the wifi connection and need to be restarted on a weekly basis if not more often. Secondly, they have TERRIBLE range. Using a variety of computers, I succeeded in getting no more than 30 foot range. I located the routers as high as possible and away from sources of interference, use only 5.8GHz cordless phones, and experimented with different channels. They simply don't perform well.Their customer support is absolutely the WORST I have ever experienced, and I deal with a lot of electronics for home and for work.After 16 months, the first of them has now completely failed. I'm replacing it with a similar device from another manufacturer.I'd give it one star, but it does, usually, work."
5,Good solid router,Just plug in and go with this one. I got it because it supports 11b and 11g well as I have one Intel Centrino laptop which is 11b and a desktop and Apple Airport both of which are 11g. Not many routers handle this well. I have it going through two solid masonry walls and a huge refrigerator with no performance problems at all. For the price and performance you can't beat it. There are faster routers around but with proprietary protocols with non standard MIMO etc that just would not work well with my Centrino or Airport. Excellent tech support
3,DI-624,"The wizard is not intuitive, but after a time you understand it and it is easy. The 108mbs is only if all wireless computers on the network are at 108. It always shows port 113 as closed, but I have not found a way to stealth it. I replace a Microsoft MN-700 with it and it seems to be faster, but the security is not as good."
4,Performs as Promised,"I read many reviews before purchasing the D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router and although there were negative comments, there were more for any other acceptable alternative. I'm a Mac user and found it tricky to set up, calling tech support before I got it right. But now that it's up and running, it works perfectly. My MacBook Pro gets a full signal anywhere in the house, and most of my yard which is over an acre. I downgraded it to four stars for the lack of comprehensive instructions, but their tech support was both courteous and very helpful. After a couple of months now, It still works seamlessly, allowing my portable wireless internet access and my desktop access through Ethernet connection. Based upon my experience, I recommend this for others as well."
4,Good but...,"Works perfectly. Yes perfectly. Flawlessly. That being said, the installation instructions provided with the unit are not the best. Thank God I have an eighteen year-old son. What I struggled with for an hour he fixed in thirty seconds. I'm sure customer service would have helped just as quickly, but being a guy I just couldn't call for help. You know how it is."
2,"easy to use, but plauged with problems","This router is easy to set up and easy to use, but the constant line-dropping, the constant rebooting and the wireless rejections cause endless frustrations.Despite all the evidence against this product (a google search for 'PADT TAG' - the line-dropping problem - lists d-link routers in the first 14 finds!!!), the D-Link company *flat-out* denies any fault or problem with their creations.Another classic case of the marketing department running the technical support!"
3,Audible ringing noise,"Hey. I've got an apple airport card in my desktop dual g4. I plugged the router into my roomates pc and bingo my mac recognized it. end of story. However, this thing emits a really high pitched ring that is annoying to my ears. I dunno if anyone else gets this or not, or if it just happens with all these things. Anyway, just beware.d"
4,south park freek,"You have to see these videos. The best episodes of the collection is ""Mr Hankey the chrismas poo, and toms rinoplasty and pink eye. The only problem is that they bleep out the bad curse words. Watch Kenny die in every episode. I can't wait until they put more south park episodes on video."
2,more or less,"when i first saw the series i laugh, but now that i see it again i saw that the comedy is like the beavis and butthead show, so don't buy this videos"
2,Not so funny,"Just got through watching this. The jokes are cruder, less funny, and they just keep on beating on the same thing again and again. I enjoyed the first 3 volumes but these don't cut it. Also, you can't fast forward thru the credits or FBI warnings (that appear with each cartoon. I was disappointed in this release."
4,Rythm Band Triangle 5 inch,Very sturdy item. My 5 year old granddaughter is very musically inclined and she loves it. That makes Grandma happy!
4,Good Triangle,"The sound is pretty clear, not tinny/cheap-sounding. It would be nice if the knob had a little longer string on it though."
3,You'll be happier with an earlier release,"Disappointing from first track to last. All the spice is gone.For example in Dang Me, the words: ""lack nineteen dollars of having"" are all the same note, and spoken, not sung. Apparently his vocal agility was gone. In the same song, ""high from the highest treeee-YEEE!"" - the high-pitched ""YEEE!"" on the end is gone.The same thing in ""Chug-a-lug"". There's no uplift at the end of ""hi-dee-ho"". Still a pretty good song but just doesn't sparkle.The spice in a Roger Miller song is that he transitions from high to low and back, or the reverse. On this disc he might transition up or down, but not back, and that makes it dull.I give positive points for the collection of songs which is excellent for the price."
3,Get the box set,"All of these tracks are re-recordings Miller must have made later in life. The problem is that there is no disclaimer so that the consumer isn't aware of the this until you get the disk home. The box set, The Genius of Roger Miller, is the real McCoy. My recommendation is to spend the money and get the box set."
2,GOOD QUALITY--POOR COLOR,COLORS ARE BASIC IN MOST INDUSTRY. BONE IS A BASIC COLOR & CUSTOMER IS NOT HAPPY WITH THE YELLOW TONE
2,Very Basic,"I just read this book but skipped a lot of it. It's very basic and doesn't get into depth on any one subject. It covers customer targeting, marketing, basic HTML, basic search engine info, etc. If you know nothing about web sites and nothing about business, it might be worth checking it out at the library but I wouldn't pay for the book. Just when you get some information on a subject, the author moves on to something else. A book with a wide scope should be much longer than this so it can flesh out some of the details."
4,Ozone Therapy for AIDS video,"This video was made in 1993 but is still relevant. It is well done, interesting and informative. It discusses the history of how this therapy developed, some case histories and some applications. The film treads softly but forthrightly when discussing the politics that works against the mainstreaming of this therapy. I am a registered nurse and I consider this video to be of a caliber worthy of recommendation to colleagues. At the same time it should be easy to understand by people without any healthcare training."
3,Atmospheric Italian Horror,"By no means is this a classic of horror cinema (apparently it's been locked away in a vault since it's disastrous Italian one-screening release in the 70's), but it is nonetheless a fun and moody descent into euro-erotic atmosphere. There is a creepy feel to the proceedings which is backed by a foreboding musical score, solid acting and stylistic use of lighting and camera movements. It's very low-budget and the narrative is minimal, but the film's shortcomings are redeemed by it's dream-like ambience. Nudity abounds and there's a very fake spider, but this is one small gem that italian horror fans should check out. The DVD lets you watch it in Italian with english subtitles (this is the better choice) or in the English-dubbed version. Also contains the Italian and the English trailers."
2,not the best movie,"I was hoping for something satanic, you know, ritualish. This movie attempts to portray a deep drama with dark overtones. When you consider that it's Italian with English subtitles, that's a pretty hopeless mission. Oh, and the nudity hardly registers. Quality and delivery time were good - a few days."
3,Nude for Satan,"The title says it all,it's not a very deep film,a bit funny,very silly with plenty of flesh to keep you wondering what's next. Gotta love the audio in the openning scenes with the cars...and the giant spider will have you rolling over laughing. Worth seeing at least once."
2,It's really a comedy...,"This is a staple of late, late night TV in Sydney. Whilst it's probably intended to be a cross between horror and soft porn, it's soooo bad that I've just about split my sides laughing each time I've seen it. It's a hoot!!"
2,A minor Italian sexploitation/horror rarity.,"""Nude for Satan"" is a minor Italian sexploitation/horror rarity from the 70's with the emphasis much more on sex than horror."
4,Satanic Bliss,"First off, the opening scene is that of a naked woman. This is a very good omen of things to come. Now I prefer the finger down the throat, herion addited woman, however, it is nice to see some real, as created women (naked of course).Wonderful bodies, errie plot, nice camera work, overall a well rounded erotic horror movie. I hate spiders,this I freely admitt, however if like myself you are an aracnicphobic, don't let the spider scene scare you off. It has apbout 25 legs so it's not really a spider. Satan could have been more evil (a better actor). Then again this is erotica.. It's well done, end of review."
1,GARBAGE,"The movie was boring,slow paced,unrealistic,stupid,and a total waste of time and money...and those were it's good points."
2,satan or not,"This is a failing story. Nude sense and scenes are not applicable. Satan is not powerfully defined against the conventional religion.At any stage, the story is not convinving. A boring movie."
4,Quit it,"Alrighty.Firstly, I enjoy both the Barbie and Bratz seies of dolls.They both have thier pros and cons... Get over it, but BOTH do have flaws!Anyway... As for Barbie copieing Bratz, yes they do, but Bratz also copies Barbie.An example of this: Barbie first released swapping heads: My Scene dolls.Then Bratz followed...All toy manufacturing companies copy each other's ideas to make money. That's right ALL!And as for Bratz being a pain to remove from the box: Yes. They are.But they are not glued in place, they are tied in place.If you do not mind ripping the box or cutting it, it's easy enough.However, if you wish to keep it all intact, it is a pain and time consuming.Now stop this nonsense, and enjoy your dolls."
5,Fun doll for pre-teens,I bought these for my nieces and they absolutely loved them. This is one of the nicer Bratz dolls ... lovely long hair and not tacky like some of the others.
4,SHE IS OKAY,"SHE IS VERY CUTE. SHE'S JUST NOT *AS* CUTE AS THE YASMIN DOLL IN MY OPINION. I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YASMIN!!! SHE IS BY FAR THE PRETTIEST OF ALL OF THE BRATZ GIRLS. FOLLOWED BY SASHA. AND THEN BY CLOE, MEYGAN AND JADE. THIS DOLL IS STILL WORTH HAVING. I GIVE HER A 4."
4,Great keyboard for a HTPC,"I bought this keyboard several years ago and it has worked well every since... I recently put it on a new home theater PC and it works great. The only downside as far as I see it is it's use of infrared versus radio, so line of sight can be an issue. This does have an advantage though as it doesn't interfere with wifi or cordless phones.Overall very good!"
4,Very nice and great value,"I usually buy 850 TC sateen sheets as I like very soft, very comfortable sheets. For $20 a set, I thought, what the heck, I'd give these a try. They are very nice and soft. The color isn't perfect for my room and other bedding but i also bought a white set, and those are equally as nice. Spend $100 or $200 more for a set and you'll have 5-star sheets. Spend $20 and get these ones, almost as good."
5,One of my favorite authors...,Tom Rusk gives great easy to read practical insight into the behaviors of humans and interprets those behaviors in ways that help you understand how best to interact with them. my favorite by this author is The art of Ethical Persuasion! Awesome book!!!
3,Not as good as parts one and two,"Easily the most political and the least engaging of the three novels that make up the Cairo Trilogy, Sugar Street is a must-read only because you've read the first two installments and feel the need to finish what you've started. The focus of Sugar Street is more on the younger generation of characters -- the children of Yasin and Khadija and others. So the characters that you grew attached to in the first two novels, like the authoritarian family patriarch, take more of a supporting role in this one. That's disappointing. I felt like these new, younger characters were just thrust into the spotlight, and I was supposed to care about them automatically. And of course, it just doesn't work that way. I also felt like the political situation in Egypt received too much attention in this book, and that took away from character development and interpersonal relationships. All in all, Sugar Street was the least interesting of the three. I was glad when I finished it."
2,boring,the story portraits the husband as a god and the wife is his forever subsevient wife. Boring .
5,Recommended,"The conclusion and final disintegration of the formerly powerful patriarchal family. Brings one through the third generation of tradegy, loss, and spiritual transformation and leaves almost every individual in misery. I enjoyed the first and final books in this trilogy and feel I came away with a better understanding of the conflicting forces at work in Egypt as well as the impact of culture and morality on individual actions and spirituality."
1,Bad product,"1. My head is not as big as Neal Cuveto, but the plastic arm broke after 1 week of wearing.2. After about 2 weeks of use, the battery dies as soon as I put it on my head, or I put my hand between 2 ear pieces. I have to keep it charged all the time. It is not wireless anymore."
1,Unsupported Junk,"Product is unsupported by Creative. I have a bigger head and they are uncomfortable to wear. Also, not working - though shown as connected. Not clear if they can be used with a bluetooth link seperate from the converter provided - which may be my problem. But as I said, not working and not supported.Dell also refuses to accept return."
3,They Simply Work,"Creative's SL3100 Bluetooth headphones simply work. After a full charge, I'm getting between 8 and 9 hours of connect time before the transmitter or headphone battery gives out. Thoroughly acceptable for a work day or gaming session.The sound is good but not great. There is a slightly noticable noise floor. This becomes much more apparant when you connect the headphones directly with the supplied cable. When directly connected to your sound source, the sound becomes more defined, more clear and more sharp.Lastly, the headphones are not as comfortable as they could be. If you wear glasses, unless your glasses' temple tips are very thin, you will feel them and end up with dents in the side of your head when you wear your glasses and the headphones at the same time.They could also be lighter.All in all, a good effort. They're good but not great. Definitely room for improvement in the next iteration."
2,Sizing is an issue.,"In short, decent sound was not offset by a high degree of discomfort from wearing these. They weren't particularly adjustable, and so if you don't have a head that happens to work for them, it's not going to work.I'd recommend trying out a variety of headsets first, then checking the brands that seem to work for you. In the meantime, until the manufacturers realize that there is perfectly adequate ""fitting technology"", we'll stick with things that cost a fifth of what we're paying for here and give a lot more."
1,Music accompanies the sound of waterfalls,"Some of the reviews of this CD are misleading. This CD is not just the sound of waterfalls--the sounds are accompanied by music. Instruments include classical and folk guitars, pan flutes, bells, kalimba, soft horns, mallets, strings, and music box.I gave this CD a low rating because it wasn't what I wanted and wasn't what I thought I was getting, but it may be a fine CD if music accompanying sounds of nature is what you seek."
4,Great,Waterfalls sounds on cd are a wonderful way to relax. It's great to put this in and block out the rest of the noise and sounds of life for a while.
4,"Finally, a character I can relate to!","While all of the Stepp Sisters are very relatable in one way or another to every individual, I felt like Ellie was the most relatable to my own person. I really enjoyed this book and the trials and tribulations that went with the characters. I stated in my review of ""Getting What You Want"" that Ms. Love was minorly lacking in the vocabulary as she used the same adjective on several different occasions over and over, making it feel as if she didn't know any other word to use it. This time around, I feel like someone slapped her on the wrist and told her to use different words. It was great, a quick, relatable read for the hopeless romantic in anyone."
2,ehh disappointed...,"I loved the first book...Chase was so kind and loving and sexy--and here comes Mason...with more than enough problems and was never nice just to be nice. I think he had too many problems...either make him a drinker or make him damaged from his divorce but the fact that he had both was a downer...which made Ellie even more a downer...she should have been stronger, and more deserving of a better guy--just cause she is the heavy sister means she has to learn to deal with someone elses issues because shes got her own. I was annoyed. Wanted to like it...but didnt.Im hoping story 3 is better!"
2,Disappointing and awkward,"I was pleasantly surprised by the first book which, despite being somewhat formulaic and predictable, kept my attention the entire time. This one, however, did not.The main problem for me were the two leads, whom I found almost too incompatible. I never really understood why they were in love and didn't feel like I was on the journey with them, but rather like it was being forced down my throat. Although I liked Ellie, the heroine, I found her way too naive, making some of her comments and some moments between the two unrealistic. Halfway through the book, I was ready for it to end and only kept reading because I'd already downloaded it on my kindle and didn't have anything better to do."
3,Old fashioned romance,"An easy read..nothing new here but a nice,somewhat sexy romance.I much preffered Kathy Love's vampire book..it has more spice and humour in it.."
4,Codependancy Handbook,"I made it to the last 100 pages asking myself,""What is wrong with this woman?"" It led me to research codependancy on the internet. This is the first of the 3 Stepp Sisters books I've read, but I plan to read the other 2. From the reviews I've read, I suspect they may address the same problem. I haven't found a good definition of what codependent means. I always had a vague notion that it was someone who encouraged bad habits in others. In this book, Ellie goes to great pains to avoid seeing her lover's alcoholism. So, though I haven't found a good definition, I suspect these books may offer an excellent illustration. I wonder if that was Ms, Love's intent. I'm pretty sure Mason will get help for his addiction. I'll be curious to see if the sisters get help for theirs by the time the series ends."
1,Can it get any worse?,"This is the story of Elli, an overweight librarian who lives in a small town in Main, called Middlebrook. Later in life she comes across her old high school crush Mason who is now the mayor and also has a drinking problem. Mason tells Ellie that he'll help her with some issues regarding the library, if she has sex with him.Hello, isn't that a major case of sexual harassment by a politician?Did anyone else just thought that was funny, or what? Wow...Anyhow she agrees and they start having an affair, about a month later she finds out she is pregnant, Masons alcohol problem seems to magically disappear, they get married and he wins the next election as a mayor.This must be the most shallow, dullest, and unrealistic story I've ever read!"
2,Too many typos,"I haven't read the first book, but I was looking forward to reading this because of the reviews. The story itself was fun,although somewhat predictable. Then again, it's supposed to be just a light romantic novel which makes it a fun read. My problem is the number of typos all over the ebook version that I would, at times, read the same paragraph twice just to make sure because they certainly were throwing me off and the entire flow of the story. I wish publishers would pay as much attention to editing e-book versions as they would regular published versions."
2,Just Plain Disappointed!!!,"When I first came across this item I was happy to find a hair cutting kit with a quality name and at a affordable price but that's where my excitement stopped.. Upon receiving and trying the kit I was very disappointed. First the combs I received were so thin and bendable that you could barely get them thru the hair so I had to use my older yet stronger combs.. Next the clipper comes with a sliding thumb-operated switch that allows you adjust the combs to the proper cutting height however in my case it just moved on its own while cutting hair. Lastly the cut hair became clogged at the bottom of the clipper comb and that made it difficult to cut. Everybody has to make their own choice when buying these kits so maybe someone else will have a better experience then I had, but I could not recommend this one. So I sent it back.."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature. The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference.I do not recommend this product."
4,Money Saver,"I have used this haircut kit on myself and in a friend, and it's working very good. The adjustable combs work fine, and I couldn't find any other with that much range of sizes. I haven't had any trouble regarding the adjusting lock nor the weakness of the combs. It's giving me good results and saving me money. I took the risk to buy it, although previous reviews weren't that good, I'm happy it didn't disappointed me. I would like to have left/right ear combs for this trimmer, though."
1,broke shortly after the first few uses,"I gave this item as a gift. So I was disappointed when after only a few months of use, it was broken. I'm not sure what happened, but my haircutter has lasted for years."
2,OK for the price,"Not a very powerful motor, feels very light and flimzy... Fine for trimming sideburns. For $16.99 you get what you pay for. Not too many other cordless options out there for this price."
3,Light duty hair cutting,"I like this cutter, but it's not so good for heavy duty cutting and the battery will drain after a little while. Otherwise it does cut okay and there is no cord to hassle with when the wife cuts my hair."
4,Works well for me as a beard trimmer,"I replaced a Conair beard/mustache trimmer whose battery had died, and I've been very happy with it. I like the fact that it can run with the power supply plugged in, not an option with the Conair. I'm surprised at the negative comments in the other reviews, since I've never had the adjustable comb (which controls how long it leaves your hair) fall off. I do agree that one of the combs in the kit is thin, but I like that factor. I find it works well for me when I'm done washing my long hair in the shower. I use it to dump most of the water prior to toweling it dry. If you don't like that kind of comb, go spend a buck or two for a good, stiff comb or three. I wear a full beard and often neglect shaving my neck and cheeks for days, and the trimmer with no comb is great to knock down the stubble before I shave it."
1,I wanted these to work well...,"I've used Wahl corded clippers to cut my hair for the last 15 years or so, the same set! I really wanted these clippers to be a good replacement, but the quality is abysmal. They may look decent in the picture, but they are very cheap plastic, extremely weak motor (even when plugged in), these just don't work very well on hair, they get constantly bogged down/loaded up even when plugged in, & they also get clogged, for some reason they won't release the hair, it just piles up in the blade... perhaps as a cheap beard trimmer they might suffice, but I didn't find them acceptable at any price, so I had to send them back. I am surprised Wahl is willing to put it's name on these."
1,What a Piece of Crap,Bought this at Canadian Tire. Wahl used to be a name to trust. not anymore. i don't know how the makers of this thing sleep at night. If you had a contest to try to build the crappiest clipper this would win. even the case is crap. i've had it maybe 9 months and its dying already. won't hold a charge and will hardly work when plugged in. the cut was always bad. i could get closer with a pair of children's scissors. if i could rate this a negative 5 stars i would. This is not good value at any price. Run away from this clipper - there are no redeeming features. wait i take that back - the little tube of oil and the packing foam work just fine.
1,"Eventhough it's inexpensive, it's not worth it","I thought I can save some money by purchasing this CD, but I was totally wrong. I got what I paid for - famous songs are listed but not sung by their famous singers and bands . It's best to stick with ESPN's Jock Rock and Jock Jams or even Greatest Sports Rock & Jams, if you are looking for quality sports CDs."
1,Not the one...,"My brother got this for me after I told him I wanted the Jock Rock CD. It was not what I wanted. There was a bunch of poorly done knock-offs of the big hits, not the original.After I played this CD for him, he went out and bought the real Jock Rock Album..."
2,Interesting,"Interesting to read a book written so long ago, but do not follow everything it states as correct. It comment of drink distilled water may have been ok many years back but not today. Read the world health comments.The eating of raw vegetables is great"
4,useful,i like all of Dr. Walker's books. They are helpful and simple and worth reading. I recommend them very highly.
1,Not received,Not received so nothing to review!!!!!! What a joke - I am in desperate need of this for my Mothers cancer diagnosis - just one BIG disappointment. Not the only book order by the way - a total of 5 costing me 178.00 @& to date NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,This is not a jazz album,"Aside from ""Big Bad Drummin' Dude,"" the average listener would not be able to tell this is a jazz album. It's got some thick jazz chords, and it has saxes, trombones, and screaming trumpets, but there is no swing and no improv. The album mostly consists of slow, straight-laced hymn-style arrangements of Christmas carols that could be performed by any type of ensemble-- this ensemble just happens to be a jazz band. It's well-performed, just not ""jazzy."""
3,"Captivating, interesting","Not only for common interest. A good guide through history of food for food scientists, researchers and food safety people."
