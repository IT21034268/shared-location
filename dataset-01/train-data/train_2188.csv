3,Interested in Iraq? There are better books...,"I have nothing against Jessica. She seems rather naive but nice. Rick Bragg didn't handle the material very well, ruining what could have been a better story. I'm surprised at Jessica's choice of an author. I am a soldier that served in Iraq for the past year and I would think most Americans would want to learn about IRAQ rather than Jessica and with that in mind, I highly recommend two other books: ""Because Each Life is Precious"" and ""Mayada, Daughter of Iraq."" Both books are spell-binding and Mohammed Odeh and Mayada Al-Askari are REAL heroes, people worth reading about. Mohammed basically saved Jessica's life. Mayada Al-Askari saved a lot of Iraqi lives due to her influence with the higher-ups in Iraq. Like I said, REAL HEROES and you learn about Iraq in the same read. Both books are good gifts for soldiers."
1,I wonder if she gave the money back,"I just saw on the news that she said this was fabricated. While I think what she went through was horrible, and she did survive it. There are a few issues. First of all she was out of it most of the time according to her. She did not fire a single shot. There were several real herose in the book who endured torture and stuff like that. It was dumb luck and she made money because of it."
1,A real shame. Propoganda at best.,"Jessica happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. It's as simple as that. This book is nothing more than a propoganda piece about Jessica. Who is the real hero in this story? Not Jessica. This book should have described the folks who died trying to save everyone else. Passages read as if she actually did something--she didn't. In fact, she was in the Humvee crying while others were taking bullets. This is a real shame that a barely articulate woman has received such fan fare. The nude photos of her are probably more interesting than her ridiculous story...Save your money."
1,Enough fiction - let's get the facts,"After having publicly denied the official ""heroic rescue"" version concocted and directed by military officials, Jessica Lynch desperately needs to spice up her ordeal to make some money from it. So despite all previously official medical facts and inquiries into how she was really treated at the Iraqi hospital (see e.g. BBC program) the new ""sensations"" involve rape and a ludicrous near-amputation story. Very uninspired indeed."
4,First World Band!,"Year Future, a band composed of determined induviduals has compiled this track listing of which its main ingredients are songs from their first couple of EPs. 'The Hidden Hand' offers a glimpse into what dedicated guitar thrashing and commanding drum beats can accomplish, not to mention the screechingly insane vocals that will leave the listener yearning to hear more. At first they appear to be the typical post hardcore/punk sound but they soon grow on the ear and wrap themselves around the brain...This band has a special sound that cannot be heard by the conventional listener, but once the unconventional listener is grabbed ahold of by ""First World Fever"", it won't lack in being spun what so ever. Take a few listens."
1,corelle burner covers,The burner covers are not the same color as my Corelle Heirloom bloom dishes and I expected the covers to be made of the same material as my dishes - I received enameled tin - I would not recommend this product and my true rating is zero.
4,A very interesting trip through China,"This is the story of an American and his life - which was totally interwoven with China.Lilley was born and raised in China. And then working for the American government was either stationed in China or working on China from outside. In many ways giving him a unique view of the country.This book tells that tale. And while the book is clearly China from his viewpoint, his view is such that it gives a very interesting picture of China over the last several decades."
4,The beginnings of rodeo,"This look back at the early days of rodeo (going from ranch to ranch and betting on who can ride an unbreakable horse) was very interesting. The characterization between the veteran cowboy and the young wannabe was well done. You can see the beginnings of Flanagan's new rodeo series in this book. I would recommend it, but be aware that it is set in a much earlier time. It is not a contemporary. If you love westerns that focus on relationships, buy this book."
1,worthless,"This woman can not write, her book has no substance, there is basically nothing to review. What is interesting is how much weight she has lost from then to now. Star claims she has not had a gastric bypass......... could have fooled me. My friend tommy met her, he said she is rude and smelly. She is the most annoying person on the view. who did she screw to get on the view?"
1,Fat cow- poor model for Us Black females,"I feel sorry for us all the Black females out there trying desperately to find some role models for themselves. Star Jones won't do it! She is fat unattractive and arrogant to boot! yet she self proclaimed herself to be a diva. yeah, ok. wake up everybody. an average Black girl cannot identify herself with that. she has a collection of wigs and diamonds, do you? she gets paid 120K to be on that stupid show, do you? no wonder she cannot find a decent brother to marry her."
1,There is more than what is written,"I found the book well-written but regret buying it. I have since found the author to be less than nice. She spouts chrisitanity in an entire chapter but I for one beleive you don't need to tell people you are a christian, they can tell by the way you treat them. I am only one of among many who have had a bad experience with the author and would love to have our money refunded. Aparently, there is more to the story than what is printed in the book."
4,Great Driving Music,This is Cd is great for a driving trip. Great vocals and great music. My husband and I both enjoy this cd. If you like Jem and Dido you will like this.
3,Pretty but dull,I guess I was expecting a little more tension/variety/spark....It just sounds dated and way too adult contemporary to my ears....Sade Lite.
4,Grateful to Hear Her Again,"I am a big fan of Morcheeba, but mainly because of Skye's beautiful, sexy voice. She has a wonderful range and sophistication not often found in pop music. I was dissapointed when she parted ways with Morcheeba, but the silver lining is that this album showcases her voice more than Morcheeba ever did. These are also excellent songs, so we get to see Skye shine as an artist.Welcome back, and thanks Skye.Anyone reading this should also check out Helicopter Girl, AKA Jackie Joyce (formerly of Mouth Music)."
4,THIS IS A NICE PORTABLE 3 SPEED TURNTABLE AND RADIO.,"THIS IS A NICE SET IF YOU HAVE A LARGE RECORD COLLECTION,THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PLAY,WHEN ON A TRIP,OR AT THE CABIN.THIS SET FILLS A ROOM WITH NICE SOUND...DONT EXPECT HIGH FIDELITY AT THIS PRICE POINT..,JUST GOOD SOUND.THIS SET WOULD MAKE A NICE GIFT."
1,Bad edition!,"Very... but very bad edition... if this books costs me 1 cent I would feel swindled.Don't get me wrong, this Hermann Hesse book is good, the bad here is the edition. I think I'll use this for my BBQ.Update: Curious to see how those 5 stats reviews doesn't show the users purchased the book. They are paid reviews for sure."
5,Vale a pena comprar,"O 贸culos Ray-ban chegou em 贸timo estado, aproximadamente 20 dias ap贸s a compra (demorou este tempo, pois ficou varios dias na alfandega). Quando chegou no Brasil, tive que retirar no correio mais pr贸ximo e paguei uma taxa de 60% do valor do produto (R$ 98,00), mas mesmo assim valeu muito a pena."
2,Not impressed.,These glasses looked plenty great in the picture but when I received them I found that mine were fairlyflimsy. A few months after having them they got bent out of shape and no longer fit correctly at all ( even tho I madesure to take good care of them). It is possible this was just a problem with the pair I received but either way fairlydisappointing considering the money I spent on them.
2,Disappointing (and they usually aren't),"Both my 12 yr. old son and I caught ourselves looking at each other at the end of each cartoon with a puzzled and disappointed feeling. Why weren't these episodes funny like past Spongebob DVDs? They didn't seem to have much humorous content and all ended sort of abruptly with none of those chuckles we used to get at the end. I'd be interested in hearing other viewer's opinions after they've viewed the DVD. It seems like the recipe for humor was lost somehow with this DVD. I finally googled ""Spongebob Last Stand Reviews"" and found that others seemed (in some cases) to comment that this wasn't one of the better DVDs. I hope this isn't a trend as we have every one of the DVDs and this one stands out as something gone wrong"
2,"Okay, but . . .","I have collected Avon for over 25 years. Until this summer, I have relied on a 1985 collector guide from another publisher, who no longer publishes them. Since ""Bud's"" was the most recommended, I gave it a try. Call me spoiled by my old all-color price guide, but the black and white photos make searching time-consuming. The items are grouped with no rhyme and reason--wouldn't you put the bride decanter on the same page as the groom? Typos and misspellings can be found on almost every page. The page numbers in the index are off. This book seems to be just one big ad for Bud's dirty joke book,(order form in the back)."
5,"""The"" complete pricing resource for collectible Avon.","Mr. Hastin has been quite thorough with his ""Collector'sEncyclopedia"". In addition to countless photos and detailed descriptions, Current Market Values for all collectible Avon (both Mint In Box and Bottle Only Current Market Values for many) are provided. In addition to the oldest Avon collectibles, newer items issued especially for Avon by Cherished Teddies, Barbie, Hot Wheels, Sesame Street, Disney, Warner Brothers, etc. are included.As website coordinator for the Avon Collecor's Lost & Found...I utilize and recommend this this guide on a daily basis. END"
5,no title,"Compilation of his various criticisms, published in 1960. He had a genius for original and apt metaphors and similes, his writing always a pleasure to read, even if some references are now lost in time. His barbs were truly wicked, his praise genuine."
1,Bad smoke smell when it gets hot,"I bought this for my gas grill to spread the heat and reduce flare-ups. But after it gets hot, it begins to smoke with an unpleasant smell. I think it must be from the enamel paint. I thought it would burn off after awhile but it never did. It is now in the recycle bin waiting for the next pick-up to the dump.Don't buy this."
3,Better than expected despite the tiny budget.,"I watched this movie fully prepared for a cheap, trashy shocker of the kind you usually find in the direct-to-video bargain bin. Yes, the movie is incredibly low-budget, but it makes the brave choice to focus on characters and story over effects and horror. What they managed to create is an enjoyable ghost story/light mystery that was a nice evening diversion. The cast is amatueur but likable, and the film even manages to sqeeze a bit of spookiness from its minimal effects. Certainly a cut above most movies of its kind."
3,Interesting but not scary!,"This is an interesting story despite the shortage of professional actors. It almost appears to have a religious agenda of some sort. It would be fine for young, vulnrable pre-teens who are home-schooled and not used to regular horror films. In short, it is absolutely safe for family viewing which is what I suspect the film-makers had in mind."
4,Much better than expected.,"While this is a low-budget film, I would place it in the ""B+"", not the ""B"" list. The actors, while unknown, are better than many well-known ones. The story is well-written and well shot.While it is about a haunted house, it is not a horror story, and there is only a very small amount of blood at the end.The special effects are not CGI, but done in-camera, and done very well, with soft focus and skilled use of light and shadow.Expect ""suspense"" rather than horror, and you will probably enjoy it."
1,"Horrible not ""Horrorble""","I am a huge fan of B movie slasher, horror and suspense flicks. This movie was terrible and boring. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!"
5,Best book EVER for Blessing ways,This is such a helpful book and is easy to read. If you are planning on throwing a blessingway at your house....this is the best book to make sure it is a success!!
5,There's More To The Picture Than Meets The Eye,"Lot of great soft hits here often overlooked because of the majestic Rust albums. Standout cut is Look Out For My Love with Crazy Horse. Great harmonies with the late Nicolette Larson, especially on Four Strong Winds."
5,"Neil Young, early music","Neil Young made beautiful music in his early years, then he kind of got off track...we love the things he did with Nicolette Larson, his wife, Pegi Young, EmmyLou Harris...and of course Ben Keith, Spooner Middleton and Grant Boatwright...as in the Heart of Gold DVD he did at the Ryman Theater...anyway...he's a great musician and a good person.."
4,"Good, not the best","A good, soft Neil album. ""Look Out For My Love"" is the best track, but the title track is close by. I MUST KNOW WHY THEY DO NOT RELEASE ON THE BEACH AND TIME FADES AWAY."
5,Polished Young,"Comes a Time is arguably Young's most polished and commercially astute album. It combines the dark, anarchic artistry that sets him apart from his talented colleagues Crosby, Stills, and Nash with the songcraft and production skills they possess, skills that Young shares, but which he only chooses to demonstrate on occasion. An example of this combination from the album is ""Look Out for My Love,"" one of Young's finest compositions. Comes a Time appears almost effortless, but its value is highlighted when set beside his later ""follow-ups"" to Harvest, Old Ways and Harvest Moon, which, apart from significantly weaker songs and lyrics, appear forced in comparison."
4,Harmonious,"Sandwiched between DECADE and RUST NEVER SLEEPS comes a little folksy number produced out of the fertile mind of everyone's favourite Canadian singer.COMES A TIMES takes the country tinge of HARVEST to another level.His voice blends well with backup singer Nicolette Larson on a majority of the album's tracks.Many of the album tracks have become Young concert staples:COMES A TIME, LOOK OUT FOR MY LOVE,HUMAN HIGHWAY(title for a later Young film),LOTTA LOVE(which Nicolette Larson had a hit with).COMES A TIME has an air of hopefulness and peacefulness about it;Young has been burned before,but is still hopeful on love and life.The only track that does not fit in this collection is MOTORCYCLE MAMA;but this is only a minor quibble.Although the music is gentle,it still has a lot to say."
5,He's still one of the greatest ever,"True to his professional approach to authentic recording Neil has again surmounted the obstacle of remaining himself and just presenting the finest listening and greatest entertainment to his loyal fans. I only wish that I could be sitting in front of him and his band as he rolls out this current lineup of classics... if only to take in the reaction by his audience. Neil seems to understand the value of solid vintage musical harmony between his creativity and his delivery. Keep 'em coming, Neil."
1,Powerful but leaks,"Powerful (but very, very loud), this Smoothie Pro 600 worked like a charm, but after a few dozen uses and cleanings, the smoothies start to leak through the rubber sealing at the bottom of the canister. Also, the plastic twist-off blade does not lock into place very well, and because of the powerful motor, it sometimes comes undone while blending causing a large mess. Just recently the smoothies are also starting to leak through the ready-to-pour nozzle, as well."
2,Smoothie maker,"I received a Smoothie Pro 600 as a gift. It worked great for this first couple of months, then I noticed that the gear wheels on the base motor and the container were wearing down. They are so worn down, contact is not being made between them, so the smoothie maker is useless. Poor quality."
1,Very Disappointed,I received this for my birthday as I was looking for a good smoothie and iced coffee machine. I was very dissapointed. It has great difficulty crushing ice and is extremely loud and noisy. It takes a long time to mix up anything in it. It also has to be washed by hand and not in the dish washer. I wish I'd picked a different machine.
1,1 star is TOO HIGH,"It lasted about 2 months of somewhat regular use. It's not easy to disassemble, but that's just the beginning. It's loud and created a burning smell almost right away. The bottom of the container starts to spin off during use after a few times of near-quality performance. This means you'll spill anything you don't manage to get out the spout, and before you know it, the motor will burn out.Separately, I purchased one model, and received a different one which was about $10 cheaper, and didn't realize it (since they don't look too different) until after it broke, and I couldn't return it anymore. Check the other reviews though: buying Back To Basics products means you'll be forced to do everything by hand soon enough....."
1,DITTO - I agree with everything DBLEECHER wrote....,"I bought mine 2 months ago. First time was okay...and next time I thought it was screwed on tightly..but it did come off also ...a BIG MESS. Not to mention all the ingredients - fruits, yogurt, $$$ down the drain...literally...and all over the counter...and dripping on floor....AND one time I noticed the leaking of the ball where it dispenses from also. I messed around with the lever and assumed that it was just sticking. Just not made very well I think.I've only used it about 5 times. This last time the jar came unscrewed AGAIN - (and I did check that it was on as tight as possible), and I will probably not bother to use it again. Too frustrating, too costly. Back to a blender for me!"
1,Bottom comes off,"The bottom comes completely off of this blender, AS YOU ARE TAKING IT OFF TO POUR YOUR DRINK. Huge mess. Will never purchase anything like it again. DO NOT BUY."
1,Horrible,They made the screw-on bottom go the same way as the motor so it screws itself off and when you lift it out of the base the bottom falls off and your smoothie runs all over the place.HORRIBLE!
1,"Don't bother to buy this crummy product, if you do, you'll be sorry!","I bought the Smoothie Pro over a year ago. It made some very nice smoothies(even though the machine is VERY noisy and very hard to take apart to clean). Then the little handle on the spigot broke and then the fun started. I have been emailing Back to Basics folks for over 3 months now. The only reply I ever got was to my last email. It was an automated response saying, ""we'll get back to ya""...someday, maybe.... Still, nothing. No pleading, Threats of posting rotten product reviews, nothing seems to motivate them to respond to help with my broken product. They had a great idea, too bad they can't build a product that lasts, or at least attempt to supply replacement parts or provide any form of customer service. As a side note, if you DO have one of these, be sure to completly take apart the little spigot mechanism and clean it. I was in for a really gross surprise when I found black mold in there. YUK-O"
3,Bubble mower,"My son loves the mower. He ""mows"" every time his dad does, but it doesn't blow bubbles worth a darn."
3,Bubble make lawn mower,A gift for my granddaughter. My son said bubbles don't work well and don't come out freely. She loves bubbles and that's why I bought it so I'm a little disappointed.
2,Garbage!,"We tried two, and neither of them blow bubbles. I actually had to jog with it and it produced SOME bubbles. My son, however, likes the mower itself so we will keep it. Once the cheap bubbles run out we will try a better bubble solution and see if that works."
2,Cute for pretend play...bubbles are MIA,"This little mower is adorable, easy to put together (only two parts) and I love all of the sounds it makes. My son loves it too! It's great for letting your kid pretend to mow the lawn, and that's about it, which is enough for me to keep it despite the fact that my original reason for buying it was for the bubble attraction. This hardly produces bubbles, and when it does, your kid has to push it pretty quickly for ""some"" to be produced. Great concept, but this one isn't working the bubble action. My kid was disappointed that it didn't really make bubbles, but after a while, he just ignored the bubble possibility and loved going around the backyard pretending to mow the lawn;)"
5,Great For toddlers,I got this for my son when he was a year and a half. He loves it. We have had this toy for over a year and stillto this day plays with it. He's very rough with it and it hasn't broken yet. The bubble solution don't leak if you put it inthe toy right. I would recommend this toy to anyone.
2,Very Disappointed,"I was so excited when I bought this the other day for my almost 2 year old because she loves bubble. It was really easy to put together, but that was the only thing that was good about it. No matter how hard we pushed, it was really hard to actually get any bubbles to come out. I followed the directions of pushing for about 15 feet but it still did not work properly. I think I wasted almost a whole container of bubble solution (eventhough I know it is really cheap) just trying to get any bubbles to come out. My little one now just pushes it around the lawn or back yard pretending to cut grass. So at least it is useful if there aren't any bubbles."
2,so-so,"I bought this for my 3 yr old nephew. He loved it when he opened it and insisted on opening it inside. It took a lot of tries to get the bubbles to work, and then they leaked out. He went through the bubble bottle in 5 minutes. Needless to say we had to take it away from him and clean it up. It will make a good summer toy and will be hit or miss with the bubbles. the toy itself is sturdy."
3,Fun toy but no bubbles,My toddler loves to push this around but the bubbles don't work well. We just gave up on them because they make more of a mess that they're worth when he (frequently) tips it over. We could only get a few to come out at a time if that. I would recommend if you just want a little lawn mower toy and the bubbles aren't important to you. Everything else about it is well made.
3,"Fun, but no bubbles","My daughter loves this lawnmower and has so much fun pushing it around the backyard. However, we could never really get the bubbles feature to work. In order to make bubbles, you have to push it really fast (faster than a toddler can). So, it's fun from the perspective of an outdoor toy, but we were disappointed in the bubbles feature."
1,disappointing,"We had high hopes for this toy. It spit out a few bubbles, and then didn't spit out anymore. We went through the trouble shooting part of the instructions, and got a few more bubbles, but since the initial day of play (my son's birthday) we have been unable to generate ANY bubbles from this ""bubble mower"". As I spoke to other parents, they say the same thing, that the mower worked once and then NEVER AGAIN. He loves to push it though bubbles or no bubbles. At this point bubbles would be a surprise as I don't think he even knows it is or was supposed to be a bubble mower."
2,Liquid doesn't stay in,"My kids love it, but forget bubbles... we went through the entire solution in one hour because they kept lifting the mower, and the solution was just pouring out... horrible design."
1,Bubble Bomb,"I got this for my daughter who loves bubbles. First of all just to make the bubbles you have to push hard down toward the ground while pushing forward, which was hard for me and my husband much less a toddler. When the bubbles did come out they were so close to the ground that they almost immediately popped and she had no chance of popping them herself. It does make a type of lawnmower sound but there again you have to press down toward the ground very hard and then push forward while doing so it is just not practical for a small child. It can be pushed around for pretend play, but the purpose was for great sound and bubbles. My daughter does not even want to play with it. I feel I wasted my money and would have been better off donating the money to charity or something."
5,My 2 year old son's favorite toy!,"My two year old son loves this mower and as an added bonus so do my dogs. It is great, it wears everyone out! I knew my son would probably like it, but I got it mainly so he could ""help"" me mow the lawn since I'm a single parent. It however has turned out to be the neighborhood's favorite. In the month we've had it, I bet it has gone at least a hundred miles. Also, thank goodness for the giant bottles of bubbles sold at Walmart!"
1,Where are the bubbles?,"My 3 year old hates this mower. He ""pumps"" the bubble container just like the instructions say but the bubbles do not come out. We followed the instructions but no luck. We are extremely disappointed with the lack of bubbles.Plus, my son likes to check the bubble amount when no bubbles appear and here comes the soap. So instead of a shower of bubbles like the package shows, I get a soapy wet spot. The soap container is not spill proof! Now my little boy pushes it around with no soap.This is a great concept but not a great product."
1,Returned it to the Store,"This was a Christmas gift for my 17 month old son. We chose this mower versus the others on the market for the bubble-blowing function. However, we took it for a ""spin"" and never could get any bubbles to come out. After much experimenting, I discovered that if I had a very long stretch of carpet to push it across and I got a running start, I could eventually get a pitiful little stream of bubbles to sputter out the side and rest along the floor for a few seconds. Needless to say, we have already taken it back to Toys R Us (we received a refund with no questions asked, as usual). This is not the caliber toy I expect from Fisher Price. Too bad, because it is a very cute idea."
2,No bubbles!,"Like the other reviews, the lawn mower I purchased for my 20 month old daughter didn't produce any bubbles. The mower just produced a little foam when pushed around. I didn't return it for another one bc it seems like it is a product issue. If the lawn mower gets tipped over the side the solution will spill out so be warned having the mower in doors. Other than the fact of the bubbles, my daughter likes to push the toy around. But then again, she likes to push a toy stroller around as well so any other push toy would have sufficed."
2,No bubbles,"We also could never get this thing to make any bubbles. No matter what type of solution used, amount of pumps, or how fast/hard it was pushed, the thing just does not make bubbles. It does do a great job of making messes, id never use it in my home with any liquid in it. The only reason I gave this toy stars is because even though there aren't any bubbles, my son still loves to push this thing around. Indoors or outside its a fun toy to just push around and pretend."
2,no go for the bubbles,The lawn mower does not make the bubbles. For the price I do not think it is worth it. My one year old grandchild stops using it very quickly.
1,No bubbles,"I bought this toy for my 2 yr old for Easter. It is the night before and just took it out of the box to put it together and NO BUBBLES! I did what the instructions said and the bubbles pop as they are forming. Then I emptied the mower, rinsed it out, and refilled it-still no bubbles! So here it is the night before Easter and now I'm scrambling to find him another toy when all the stores are closed. Thanks fisher price!"
3,An OK toy,"We bought this for our 3 year old and he also got another as a gift. It was great to keep him entertained especially since he could mow the lawn like daddy, but the bubble volume was not great. The containers seemed to leak and you have to push really fast (faster than a 3 year old can go) to get alot of bubbles."
3,Bubble Mower,I am so disappointed in this toy because the bubble mower does not blow bubbles. My little granddaughter loves bubbles and we talked about this but no bubbles.
4,It does work.,We have now had this for two years and it does work. I would say one of the most important things is to make sure the wheels are making good contact with the ground and that the grass isn't too long. Some bubble brands are better than others.
3,"Some work, some don't",The first one we bought didn't work at all. We read the directions and did everything they suggested but no bubbles came out. We returned it and got a new one. The new one worked no problem. I had a 2.5 yr old and a 20 month old use it. They were both able to make bubbles come out.
1,False Advertising,"My [...] received this mower as a gift and was beyong excited to have a mower like Daddy. However the first mower had no bubbles and broke the first lap around the yard and when we returned it and got another the bubbles still have never come out. We did READ all the instructions and my husband used the mower first to see if it would work, but never did for him either. We didn't have the heart to take it away again, so our son plays with a mower that has never bubbled and is disappointed everytime I tell him we can't put bubbles in b/c it doesn't work. When we contacted Fisher Price, they gave a canned response and told us to take it back. What kind of manufacture are they? We are very diapoointed with everything involving this mower and will think twice before purchasing any additional FP toys for our 2 small children."
2,No bubbles,I was so excited to get this mower for my son. I was greatly upset when I found no bubbles come out. You have to push down on the mower while pushing to get any bubbles and even then only a few come out. Very disappointed in this product! Doesn't do what it promised to do
2,It doesn't blow any bubbles,I got this toy for my 2year old cause she was always asking me to blow bubbles and trying to blow them herself so i got this thinking she could make her own bubbles but it doesn't blow any unless your going really fast and then the bubble dont make it to far from the mower. but it does make sounds and my little girl loves that part so it wasnt a complete waste of money. But Its a OUTSIDE toy only cause it is too loud to be inside.
2,Big mess,"My daughter got this for her 1st. birthday. We set it up and no sooner did we get the bubbles on and ready for her to push it did they leak all over the concrete. I thought maybe we just didn't have it on right the first time so I stuck a new thing of bubbles on it. Nope it got every where once again. After that we decided to keep it but NO more bubbles. She likes to mess with the buttons on the top and when she pushes it, it does make sound kinda like a real lawn mower."
3,Its true the bubbles dont work!,at first a littile bubbles were coming out then they stopped. I tried putting in all diffrent bubble liquid but thee was no bubbles! I kept it because my son still loved it and he loves running around with it.
1,poor quality,the mower does not blow bubbles on a regular basis. very poor quality and not worth the cost. i do not recommend this
5,Great toy,"The bubbles don't work extremely well, but my 2-year-old still loves it. It's just fun to push around and it makes a nice ""motor"" noise that he enjoys, regardless of whether or not the bubbles come out. I'd recommend it as long as you're not looking for a bubble maker."
1,Horrible. Returned it for a refund.,"Bought this last summer for my then 18 month old. It was horrible and we ended up returning it for a refund.It didn't work on grass. In the street, it would work if I pushed it and pushed the handle down and forward (awkwardly), but if my son had it and just pushed the mower like any other toy, there would not be enough friction on the front wheels to make bubbles blow out.We went threw 1/2 the bottle of bubbles in 15 minutes because it leaked and then there wouldnt be enough for the wand to get and bubble juice on it.I returned it the next day, Luckily they said others had complained too, and they allowed me to return it used."
2,"Like others, we also had no bubbles","We also got no bubbles from this mower. I read and followed the directions. Walked way more than 20 steps with it. All wheels were touching the ground. The solution was in the mower, as evidenced by the fact that small amounts of solution, and the very occasional bubble spit out the side of the mower. But no bubbles."
1,Not enough bubbles to worry about,"We pushed this thing around forever and got almost no bubbles. I think it looks very durable, but if it does not do all the things it was bought to do then it is not worth the money.The cap that goes on the bubble solution was spill proof for us, but the bubble solution spills right out of the mower if on anything but a flat surfactI would definitely recommend against this product."
2,Looks better than it works.,"Though our grandson loves pushing the mower around, the ""bubble machine"" feature on the mower works very poorly. From that standpoint there are probably better toy mowers on the market."
2,Worked for about a day,It worked for about a day and while it did it didn't work well. Not impressed and I wouldn't recommend.
2,Where are the bubbles...,"We bought this for our 2 year old and were so excited to watch him push it around the yard and blow bubbles. One problem, NO BUBBLES! When my husband and I do it, it works great, the problem is you have to push it really fast to make the bubbles come out. My 2 year old loves to push it around but it a big disappointment that there are NO bubbles. If it is bubbles you are looking for, DON'T BUY THIS!"
5,Excellent outdoors fun,"I bought this toy for a 3 year old boy. it has been in use ever since it came out of the package. excellent outdoors toy that gets kids moving. he can mowe the lawn all day, when outside. we are not using the bubble feature - this toy is lots of fun even without installing the bubbles. makes mowing sound with no batteries required. i researched different toy lawn mowers before buying this and i am very happy with this purchase."
4,Miracle Bubbles work very well,"My son was very excited about this toy when we got it for him just for the heck of it. We had just moved from an apartment to a house. It did take a long while for the bubbles to work with the original solution, which resulted in it getting tipped over and the bubbles spilling out all over. We had to get replacement bubbles and the Miracle Bubbles work jut fine. There is still the problem of it getting lifted up and bubbles spilling out, but really they are not that expensive, just more of an annoyance.The great thing about this toy, is that my son loves it, even without the bubbles. He feels like a big kid pushing it all around our screened in lanai. Sometimes it makes it in the house and gets pushed around too, which is ok when it is out of solution. He is two years old now, and still loves playing with it. He is getting a Power Wheels for Christmas, so we will see if that changes."
2,Thought it was defective,"I bought this for our 17 month old son. I was disappointed that the bubble liquid leaks out the front when it's picked up. What a waste of bubbles. I thought it was defective b/c it didn't really blow out many bubbles. We had a 3 1/2 year old over and he was able to get the bubbles to work, but only if he ran with it! The noise that it makes is pretty neat and it doesn't need batteries, but for a little guy, it's not super easy to push on grass."
1,"Bubbles don't work, messy.","This requires pretty constant, hard pushing to make bubbles. I have one and my friend has two, none really blow bubbles that well. Plus, when you pick it up (to put it away, etc) it leaks bubble solution terribly- always a mess on my garage floor when I go to take these out or put them away."
4,Try it again,"We just bought this toy for our 22 month old she loves pushing it all around and she loves the sound it makes, but there is no bubbles!!!! I went online to see if anyone else had this problem or it was just our individual toy, and read a review that suggested washing this toy out and changing solution. It works, with in 10 steps the bubbles started to come out just like on the picture. Its a very fun toy and my daughter loves it. Thank you for the suggestion."
1,It Doesn't Work,"Like most everyone else, my son's mower doesn't blow bubbles either. My husband and I both read the directions, held the bottle down for (our instruction book says 15 seconds) the right amount of time and nothing. I rinsed the mower out and tried again but still nothing. We have used up all of the supplied solution. I even put some ""homemade"" solution with dish soap and rolled it in my living room and still no bubbles. I, too, was told by Fisher Price to take it back. I just exchanged it for a second one today. We will try it out tomorrow. I may try my daughter's Gymboree bubble solution (Bubble OOdles) in it-that stuff makes the best bubbles I have ever seen- if the supplied one doen't work again. I will update if I can get this new mower to work."
1,where are the bubbles?,"I think this is the worst toy Fisher Price has made. We usually love thier toys, but this one was a disappointment. We got it home and it took a while before any bubbles would come out. Finally it started to work, but it had to be pushed very fast. My daughter did not even notice the bubbles come out, because they come out the side and go right to the ground. I think they really should come out the top. It also leaked and made a mess all over the floor. If you are going to buy this don't use it inside or you will have a huge mess!!"
3,Messy and the bubble portion doesn't work,"I bought this for my 2-year old. She's taller than your 'average' 2-year old, so the handles were a bit short. The day we brought it home, we put the bubbles that came with it, in the slot and never got any bubbles to come out. She pushed it in the grass, on the sidewalk...nothing! Then all the bubble mixture was pouring out the side of the lawn mower. I hosed it off and let her play with it. It does make a great ""mowing"" sound that I don't think any of the other models make. Fun for imaginary play if you don't care that the bubbles won't come out and the handle is a bit on the shorter side. Needless to say, we will most likely return it and buy one that does not blow bubbles."
2,"Good mower, but havent seen any bubbles yet","Our 2 year old loves pushing just about anything around. This is no exception. This mower has cool engine sounds when you push it around and swithces that click when turned.The downside is that when its pushed, it looks like it wants to shoot out bubbles, but never does. It looks more like it is drooling than anything else.Plus if it is picked up it will leak bubble mix all over. Our son bot it stuck when he ran it over one of his other toys, he then picked it up to free the mower and lost about 25% of the mix."
3,no bubbles,If you are looking to buy this bubble mower for the bubbles forget about it. I got this for my 19 month old son and he loves to push it around but it doesnt bubble like it is supposed too. We have tried everything it said to try even returned the first one we bought and still no bubbles.
2,Don't buy for the Bubbles,"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because she loves bubbles. I thought what fun it would be for her to ""help"" dad mowing the lawn and to create bubbles at the same time.I was very disappointed the mower does not blow bubbles! The manual says to check for adequate solution in mower but does not tell you how. I called the Fisher-Price Help Line and they told me to take it back. Thought maybe they could help to give me some things to check to make sure I put toy together right. (Next time I won't bother making the call)."
3,No Bubbles,"I bought this toy for a 2 year old neighbor. He was so excited when we were putting it together only to be disappointed when we got outside and there weren't bubbles. We did everything the directions said to do and nothing. He did seem to like pushing it around, but he already has a toy that he can do that with, we bought it for the bubbles."
3,Great toy but don't buy it for the bubbles,"My son received this Bubble Mower for his Birthday so he can mow the lawn like Dad does. It is a great toy for pushing around, it is sturdy and makes the good ol' rumbling sounds every child likes. The disadvantage - the bubbles don't work!! It blew out three or four bubbles and quit working. I tried everything the owners manual suggested but still no bubbles. My son doesn't seem to mind and really this may be a good thing because we won't spend so much on the bubble solution (hee- hee).We had purchased a smiuliar Fisher Price one (double the bubbles) for a nephew two years ago and also had the same problems - no bubbles but he still plays with it 2 years later pushing it around."
4,"Forget the bubbles, yet Must Buy!","I don't own this particular version of the bubble mower, I have owned older models and intend on buying a new one ASAP for our 3rd son. My 2 older sons have each owned a Bubble Mower and it was always the most favorite toy for each of them. Don't buy this with any intention of using it to make bubbles... you'll be disappointed and the child will be frustrated when it doesn't work. Don't even mention the bubbles to your kid.This mower is still loads of fun and should bring years of use to your kids. Ours were run over by cars, chewed up by dogs, dropped off playsets and mowed hundreds of yards. My boys were rough and tough on their mowers and loved them. Now my 3rd son has turned 2 and warm weather is near, it's time to buy him his own Mower!"
1,Terrible product. DO NOT BUY IT!!,"If you are interested in this toy for your 2+ year old, you better head by the paper towel isle on your way out and stock up. That is if you intend on using this thing anywhere inside your home. Sure this thing looks harmless enough, but apparently it is designed so the bubble solution just pours into a shallow open cup inside. Just a slight jolt of pushing the mower is enough to slosh the solution out onto the floor. We spent about twenty seconds putting this together by attaching the push handle and about a hour scrubbing the spilled soap out of the carpet."
2,this really takes a bit to make the bubbles,I WOULD NEVER ORDER THIS ITEM. IT IS ONE OF THE WORSE TOYS I HAVE GIVEN AS A GIFT TO MY GRANDSON.
5,Vroom Vroom.,This lawn mower is best for babes already walking well. It is a great toy and my grandson loves it!
3,Fun to mow but doesn't blow!,"My son got this for Christmas. While he loves to push it and it makes noise, the bubble part only works when the resevoir is very full and then he leaks bubble liquid all over the house. Bummer that it doesn't make bubbles cus then he would love it!"
1,Don't waste you money.... Please,I ignored the poor ratings and bought this mower anyway. It never worked right and ended up right on the garbage. When the kids pushed the mowers 1 or maybe 2 bubbles would occasionally pop out. We tried diluting the bubbles and different brands of bubbles but nothing worked. My kids were disappointed and we all gave up. Take my advice. Blow your own bubbles and save your money.
2,a big mess!,This toy is such a great ides but is very disappointing. It doesn't blow bubbles because the entire bottle simply leaks onto the ground. Make sure you don't use it inside unless you skip the bubbles.
1,What bubbles?,"I payed 20 bucks for this toy hoping to see the big bubbles they show on the box. What bubbles? It never got past sputtering foam out the side... My kids had fun using it as a play lawn mower but I already had a regular toy lawn mower. A friend had the same experience as I, ""What bubbles?"" Save your money and buy a regular toy lawnmower because you won't get more than a few bits of bubble foam stuck in the grass :-/"
2,Bubble Mower,It's hard to make the bubbles blow. You have to push hard and fast and for my little one who loves bubbles its not any fun.
5,"Lots of Fun and Exercise, too! no batteries!","I bought one of these for my two year old grandson's birthday. I had to be sure it worked so I pushed it around and around until I was dizzy but it worked great! It was the hit of the party! and got a real work out and it's still working fine two months later. Now if I could just make my erg make bubbles, hmmmm."
2,Does Not Work,"My oldest daughter had 2 different styles of Bubble Mowers when she was little and neither one ever worked. So when my youngest one was given this as a gift, my impulse was to return it to the store. But it was a different model and it was a gift from a very beloved family member, so we tried it out. We understood and followed the directions. It does not work at all. The mechanism inside turns but bubbles do not actually come out of it. I wish we had not put any bubbles in it so we could just let her use it as a push toy inside the house. (It works as a simple push toy and may encourage your child to walk - but for the price you can find something better). The idea is really cute, but it just does not function as promised. Thankfully my little one is too small to have expected bubbles. I can imagine the tears of disappointment if she had known what it was supposed to do."
2,Not worth buying!,My husband and I read the directions to load the bubbles and attempted to try out the mower and noticed that we had to push it very fast before bubbles came out. Do not waste your money on this unless you are buying it for an older kid who doesn't mind running with it.
1,Not very much fun for making bubbles.,"I was excited when my mommy got this for me after talking about it for a while. We finally got it from the store, but it was not working well with making bubbles at home. We followed the directions to put it together and then pushed the mower slowly on our back porch then a little faster. It just made soapy suds, but no bubbles. We took it back and got a different toy."
2,"It sort of works, but","We purchased this product for our 2yo grandson, followed all the directions, and my grandson couldn't push it fast enough to produce bubbles. One problem is that all four wheels need to be on the ground for the bubbles to appear. When they do appear, they stay close to the ground rather than shooting out and up. Also, if the mower is tipped one way or the other, the solution spills out.Fortunately, our grandson enjoys pushing it and hearing the sounds it makes. BONUS: it does not require any batteries.Buy it if you don't care about bubbles."
2,disappointment....to miracle,"I bought this for my 18 month old toddler despite reading the previous reviews. I guess I was hoping we wouldn't have the same problems. Well, as I feared, we got a defective toy like many. It didn't form one bubble (even with a different bubble solution), it leaked everywhere, and the back wheels wouldn't turn. It's such a disappointment because my son loves pushing it around. Return ASAP!!!UPDATE: Before returning this item, I was determined to make one last attempt at getting it to work since my little one loved to push it around. I washed it out a few times, including dumping out all the new and old bubble solution. I started the steps all over again but instead of slowly pushing the mower, as directed in the manual, I pushed it quickly. It unbelievably worked!! Granted, there aren't that many bubbles and they tend to drop to the ground soon after they form but it's better than nothing. :)"
3,Would be better if the bubbles worked.,"As others stated, it's a great toy even without the bubbles but I had hoped I would have the same success as others after switching out the bubble solution. Unfortunately, it only blows bubbles if our neighbor's six year-old runs with it. My four year-old isn't too interested in it but my two-year old loves it."
3,Bubbles Barely Come Out; But Fun For My Son Anyway!,"The bubbles on this toy come out only when my husband or myself push the toy and even then they barely come out. I have no complaints about the rest of the toy; just how my son uses it. My son is 22 months. He's a little on the wild side, so he likes to run with the lawnmower. He tends to tip it over a lot causing the bubble solution to spill EVERYWHERE. All in all, he doesn't care if the bubbles come out or not which is why I gave 3 stars. If my son is having fun with this toy, then I have no problems if the bubbles don't work as well as they probably should."
1,Bubble mower disappoitment,My 2 year old granddaughter knew that bubbles should emanate from the mower (she was the box) but no bubbles. A few would form but pop immediately at the exit on the mower. She was very disappointed and has no interest in this mower without the illustrated bubbles. We tried cleaning it out and starting again to no avail. Fisher Price normally produces trustworthy toys but the bubble mower is not one of them.
3,not great for bubbles but fun otherwise,"Like many other reviewers, we had no luck with the original bubble solution. Rinsed out with a hose and tried another solution. After awhile, pushing at a fast clip resulted in groups of bubbles, but I had to keep it going very fast. My 1 year old and 2 1/2 year old don't have much success in making bubbles.That said, it is a very cute toy and my girls enjoy the 'motor' noise and the lever and knob. I wish the bubble feature was more effective."
3,:(,Me and my daughter were very dissapointed in the bubbles. The bubbles dont make it out of the mower without popping.
4,"cool toy, but dont expect a ton of bubbles","my 13 month old loves this toy, the assembly was SUPER easy and was ready to use about 30 seconds after opening the box. however i havent really seen bubbles yet. either way it is adorable and makes a loudish but not super anoying rumbly motor sound when it is pushed."
2,Very easy to break,"This is our second one and I'm less than thrilled. It just stops blowing bubbles, the spinner stops spinning and just starts clicking. The first one came broken, the second one stopped working after a couple weeks. Not a great toy."
3,Baby loves it but can't figure out the bubbles,My baby is in love with his new lawnmower but we can't figure out how to get the bubbles to work on it.
2,disapointed,bubbles don't come out my 18 month old loves pushing it around the yard but only a few bubbles:(maybe it is the bubblesover all disappointing
2,Doesn't blow bubbles,"I thought this bubble mower would be a lot of fun this summer. My 2 year old received it as a birthday gift. It doesn't blow bubbles. At first he was really mad and threw it. But after a few days he ended up having fun pushing it around the yard. So he does play with it, but it doesn't work the way it was intended. *NOTE* he also received a Thomas the train bubble blower. It works really good. And it is super cute."
4,Lawn Fun,"After reading all of the other reviews for this product we decided we still wanted to try it out for our 2 year old but we replaced the bubbles that it comes with with Gymboree bubbles right from the start. A number of the complaints said that if the bubbles got shaken up and got to bubbly then it wouldn't work and Gymboree bubbles are less likely than others to get that way because they are a thicker consistency. It works great!! You have to push the mower kind of fast to get it to blow bubbles but our 2 year old is having so much fun with it - he pushes it a few feet to get the bubbles out, then stops and pops them (Gymboree bubbles last a super long time) and then pushes it some more. Glad we got this toy and glad we read the reviews to save ourselves from the frustration from the start..."
1,Does not work,"My 2-year-old son loves bubbles and I thought this would be the perfect gift, but it does not work. In order for the mower to make the engine noises or blow any bubbles it needs a lot of pressure which my little boy can not yet exert. The bubbles also blow straight into the ground, therefore he barely notices them. I usually love fisher price toys but this product is an awful waste of money."
5,Bubble Mower,"This is such a great toy--everyone that has a little boy should have one. Our grandson loves ""helping daddy mow the lawn"" and keep him occupied while daddy has some time to get some work done. Durable and fun!"
3,lots of exercise,The mower takes a little more pushing than I would expect for the bubbles to start coming out.
3,"She loves it, I hate it....","Well, my daughter received a gift card for her 2nd birthday and this is what she bought with it. She likes it, we haven't had any problems with the bubbles, they blow out just fine. My problem with it, is that my daughter loves to carry things around. This is very light weight and everytime she tips it, even a little bit, the bubble solution just dumps out everywhere. We only use it outside, but still, we are going through a bottle of bubbles everyday. I have decided to make my own solution with a little bit of dish soap and water, instead of buying $100 worth of bubbles to last through the summer. I think this toy is annoying, but she loves it, so I guess that's what counts!"
2,Where are the bubbles?,"We bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 16 months old... she's a little over 2 now and hardly plays with this toy. the bubbles never worked - even I couldn't push it quite right to get the bubbles out. Every once in a while she will push it along the yard b/c it does make a ""mower"" sound. We found the Parents bubble mower to be MUCH easier for her to use, the bubbles actually come out and the handle is adjustable so my 1 yr old son can use it as well."
4,Fisher Price - Bubble Mower,"My 1 1/2 year old son loves this mower. However, the little knob where the bubbles go (when there are no bubbles in it) pops off constantly and then drags around. My son doesn't mind though..."
1,Shouldn't be called a Bubble Mower,"I've tried everything I could to make it work, but it's hard to get it to blow bubbles. I bought it for my 2 year old girl, and if I have a hard time getting it to work, how is a 2 year old supposed to get it to work? I have read ALL instructions, and totally understand how it works, but it's difficult for me, no less a child. To me, this was a total waste of $16.03."
1,No bubbles,"We got this as a gift for our 18 month old and I have yet to see it make a bubble. Not to add in our ""not so perfect lawn"" he has real difficulty getting enough strength and proper leverage to actually push it without it just flipping forward."
1,Don't give it a chance!,"Pros: easy to assemble, fun to push around.Cons: the bubble factor is not worth your trouble; soap solution will spill on the ground at anything except a horizontal postion, bubbles will not work unless an exact tested mix (not the one supplied with the toy) and even then no guarantees.Overall: if you wish to use it as just a push-around mower toy (no bubbles), it's fine; if you wish to have bubbles, don't buy the toy - you will be disappointed as will your child, grandchild, niece, etc."
4,Playstation CD,"Well, I think this CD is good. It has a wide range of songs from the video games we have all began to love. I would recomend this CD to anyone who likes the music from the most popular video games out there."
4,gioia lives up to his reputation,"when reading gioia's first collection, you can't help but wonder if he is overrated. he is one of the most celebrated of the new formalists, and one of the leaders of the movement. you hear over and over how good he is. he is the writer of the ""can poetry matter"" essay. and, since he is outside the world of academia, you can't help but to think of other poets outside the academic world (wallace stevens and william carlos williams come to mind immediately). so you wonder if the guy is overrated. he's not. he writes formal verse beautifully. he has good control over the meter and line. ""The Room Upstairs"", easily one of the best poems in the collection, and my personal favorite, shows gioia's skill as a poet. i look forward to reading the other collections i have."
4,These are good jars.,Fido has been around forever. This one is a little small for 16 oz of bulk tea so I will get the next size up next time. I drink a lot of tea and this is a great way to store bulk tea.Better yet it isn't Chinese made! It's Italian!
3,In the Mainstream?,"This 1987 release isn't the Robin Trower that we listened to in the 1970's with a bluesy and dark feeling. This album is an attempt at hitting the commercial mainstream, and it's very mediocre. The first song, CAROLINE isn't the heavy, hard-hitting blues that I've alluded to, but rather a ballad of sorts, and more or less sets the tone for the album. However, there is one standout track, and that's NIGHT, which has that city-sounding lonely feeling to it, and is a welcome boost to an otherwise shaky album. I understand that bands inevitably change with the passage of time, but this album is an extreme shift from earlier efforts, and takes a lot of getting used to. This album is recommended for die-hard fans."
1,recording,This is 1987 re-release of the CD. Extremely poor audio quality. The vinyl album sounds a lot better. Extremely poor remastering work.
1,Easily the worst of RT,"Love Robin Trower. Have listened to him for 30 years, but this album really has nothing to offer. Plenty of others to choose from. Forget this one. He probably has."
1,Poor re-mastering,"I am stuck with a 1987 copy. Extremely poor quality. I sold my record collection last summer, and bought the cd to replace. What a mistake. This CD is horrible, the vinyl copy I sold sounded lightyears better. Otherwise the music is a great piece of Robin Trower work, if you have the album. Bought this copy from Rhys George, double charged me and will only give me half back for a return."
3,trower on soft rock radio???,the cd is survivor meets loverboy except for one or two songs like forever and passion you would noy know that this is a trower cd
2,This is what happens when a 70s guy does an 80s album,"I'm a big fan of Trower, but I don't get this album. This is a bad 80s pop record, not the trippy groove stuff he was know for in the 70s. Thankfully this style didn't last long. Glad to see he is back doing what he's good at these days. The vocalist on this record is good, but the lyrics are just pitiful. The only song worth mentioning is ""No Time"", which incidently is the only one that resembles the real power of Trower's earlier work in the 70s."
5,A MUST for anyone who loves Trower at all,"This L.P. never got any airplay when it came out but like most of RT's work. He's done great stuff since bridge of sighs L.P. (which is a Top notch classic to be sure) but there's so much more to this artist, and this is a great slice of him from a more modern time in his career. It is both as polished as it is Lyrical and strong. I absolutly love this L.P. It Rocks hard and yet is still very soulful as well. Not that anyone who listens to trower dose'nt know he has always had a knack for that as well as the knack for always finding great english vocalist that seem to have the same strong passionate sound to them. I find The vocals on all his albums stand up to match his great guitar vituoso."
3,Sturdy but rusts quickly,This base works well for my application. It's nice and heavy. The only downside is that rust spots appeared after only a couple weeks.
1,Eyewittness book - Fish,"NG. Not good. I ordered this book twice and both times, although the book was new, the pages inside were all winkled. I returned the book both times. I would still like the book, however, I'm afraid that I'll received another wrinkled book."
4,serious and good state,The seller delivered right in the least of times and I got a perfect memory stick!
3,Great Device *** NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SOME SONY DEVICES ***,"I purchased this device as a gift for a Sony DSC-s85 not knowing that Sony had designed their memory stick poorly ( http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1103-977004.html ). Though the DSC-S85 claims to support all levels of memory stick it does not support anything over 128MB. I guess the designers/testers at Sony never even thought that consumers will be purchasing anything greater than 128MB.Before purchasing check your manual, then check for complaints on the web."
4,Not for F707,I couldn't find anywhere that it wouldn't work for a Sony F707 camera. it doesn't! I hope this helps someone not make a mistake of trying it.
5,Very durable!!!,"I don't usually write reviews, but I just had an experience with this item I thought worth sharing. I own a few of these MemorySticks to work with my Sony Clie. Last week I left one in my shirt pocket and it went through the laundry. I was sure it would be toast, but I plugged it into both the Clie and an assortment of card readers I own and it works perfectly in each item. I'm very pleased with this item."
3,Very simplistic - perhaps a good intro for kids,"It's been a few years since I read this book, but I remember feeling gipped after reading it the first time.The concepts and examples are very simplistic. It reads at maybe a Jr. High school level.The book is also quite wasteful of paper due to the horrible formatting. Usually about half the page is left blank, vertically on the left or right side depending on the which way the page faces. I guess the publishers didn't want folks to realize what a lightweight book they were buying.If you want to introduce a kid to Libertarianism, this might be a good book for it. But for anyone serious about digging in to the guts and philosophy of Libertarianism, skip this book. It contains nothing new."
5,"Fun, Fascinating Read!","I found this short book a quick, enjoyable read! I am not from Henry County, but my significant other grew up in the area, so I am quite familiar with it. I think the previous complaint about punctuation and grammar mistakes is more of an issue with the copy editor than Ms. Perry's writing. This well researched book shows the surprisingly rich history of Henry County in the fun, spooky form of ghost stories. I look forward to reading her second volume!"
2,Unnecessary if you already,I found this book interesting and clear but completely unnecessary if you already have the basic information about the immigration. You can easily find these information on internet and for free. Plus many topics are too superficially treated so you dont have a clue of what the author it talking abouot. The author provides all of the immigration forms (that takes half of the book) but again they are unnecessary since you dont need to know HOW are they made. Interesting the Commonly asked questions to US citizenships applicants.
1,Boring,"Way too technical for me. Reads like a science journal - while I'm sure the facts are all accurate, the overall picture painted leaves you more confused than informed. It's terribly dry, overly packed with condensed references and irrelevant side notes. It's as if the author felt compelled to include every path of research, even if it ultimately had little or no bearing on the 'Ten Great Ideas'.I would have returned it, but because I kept falling asleep while reading, it it took me longer than seven days to realise my mistake."
2,Boring,"This writer manages to make some of the most fascinating moments of human achievements totally boring.Really, really boring to the point of tears."
3,It is what it is,"I paid something like $97 for this while I was in a dorm room.It's small. It's efficient.The freezer isn't great, it sort of works, but I wouldn't depend on it for anything long term (I kept some hot pockets in there...).The hose to the freezer gets in the way a bit in the back.I use it for drinks now that I'm not at the dorm anymore. It can hold about 50 cans, if anyone cares.Nothing really *wrong* with it. It's just not full of features or have an awesomely-planned out design."
2,Not a happy customer.,This refrigerator is not a good value. It's very small and cramped. Packaging was insufficient to protect it while shipping. My unit came badly damaged. One corner was completely smashed (like an accordian) and one side was caved in.
1,Freezer is ok,"The Fridge is alright, as long as it works it's good for me, but my parents thinks that I need to get my money back from it. It shipped on time and all but........... The Stupid fridge had a couple parts missing, it had a couple minor dents on it, and the bottom of the box that it came in was falling apart. The box looked like to me that the fridge fell out of the box!!! WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. HOW DO YOU RETURN ITEMS ON AMAZON.COM??? I WANT TO RETURN THIS ITEM AND GET MY MONEY BACK, AND BUY A BETTER FRIDGE IN PERSON NOT ON THE INTERNET!!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Haier HSB03 Compact 2-2/3-Cubic-Foot Refrigerator/Freezer, WhiteAs other people said - packing really bad. Arrived too damaged to use and had to send back. Total waste of time."
1,A strange disappointment,"This book about a supposedly uber-intelligent acrophobic who manages her group so well that she utterly obliterates it in an absurdly contrived accident (hm, I can't read chinese well,does that sign mean dis or dat? Let's try it...ooops!) bored me silly. Sure hope never to read the likes of this pretentious, annoyingly farfetched novel again,"
1,This book was horrible.,"I'd rather read the entire Robert Ludlum collection in one sitting than read this book again. Have you ever been trapped with somebody who won't quit talking (at a dinner, a party, or whatever) and who thinks she is deep, smart, and interesting, but is just the opposite? If you have, this book will bring back that experience. I found the writing to be on par with that of a good high school student. For example, ""She closed her eyes and let the noise of Solitaire spin around her, a tidal pool of words and glassware and background music, voices breaking against her like waves on a reef."" Maybe I was just in a bad mood when I read this, but I really hope this is not what passes as a ""tour de force"" today."
2,Weak reception,"We have had this radio for about a year.From day one it had trouble finding the auto clock source even though other units in the house have no problem using the atomic clock. If I set the clock manually it will hold for a few days or weeks and then reset to some crazy hour.The AM reception is weak on the higher stations, I like 1700, it is low volume and full of static, a portable radio right next to it has no problem.This radio is expensive and works poorly, I would not recommend it."
5,The Hudson Valley is Beautiful and So Is This Book,"At Home in the Hudson Valley is a beautiful book packed with brilliant photographs. The houses in the book are distinctive and original, the pictures capture the spaces as well as the ideas and personalities of the people who made them. Allison Serrell and the photographer Meredith Heuer pull the vitality and creativity of the Hudson Valley through the pages of the book."
5,Really Great Book!!,"I have had the older (1982) printing of this book. That book has been worn out. We use it all the time. My kids used it all the time. I took it to work to look up a plant we had been talking about. Soon everyone was coming to look up something. Anyway I decided to get the newer version, and some others at work wanted me to order them copies also. All really love this book. The pictures are good and precise, and the info all easy to understand."
5,Excellent coverage,"I have the 1982 version. I am amazed at how much of the wildlife, I come across and want to know about, is in this book. Considering they are covering North America's plants, animals, fish, insects, etc, you know they had to pick and chose what they put in this field guide. They did an wonderful job!"
4,Excellent learning tool for children,"I purchased this book for my 2.5 yr old nephew as he loves birds, insects etc and always wants to know what kind they are. He uses this book as a reference and kind look up animals by himself. The book is very easy to use. He absolutely loves it!"
4,good for basic information,"Overall i feel that this book is worth having around. Its good for plant and animal identification, but gives limited information on everything in the book. If your interested in learning more about a specific species you will need a book on that subject. I have used mine alot and have found it very useful."
1,"Great resource, but ""Updated Edition"" is untrue","I am a librarian, and my library has the 1982 edition of this book. When I saw there was an ""updated edition,"" I bought it for the library so we could have a current version of the book. Well, the book just arrived, and lo and behold, the ""updated edition"" is the 2002 *printing* of the *same book*! Don't be fooled; this is the same information they sold you 22 years ago. The only thing new about it is the banner across the front that says ""Updated Edition."""
4,A Great All-around Nature Reference,"OK, this book isn't necessarily something a Phd would use in the field, but for general, all around reference to many species, I can't think of a better guide. In fact, there are many species I could NOT locate in some of my Peterson's Field guides that were included in this book. If you are out and about in nature, this allows you to carry ONE book instead of a stack of them. No cabin or campsite should be without it. The only negatives I could give it are the fact that the insect section and mammal sections are somewhat small, but the wildflower, tree and bird sections are more than enough for the nature hobbyist that isn't working on a degree.Sad that the updated version is only a re-print... I was hoping for new, expanded info or perhaps some added species, but this still gets 4 stars from me and is a great gift for any nature enthusiast."
1,disappointed,"The pictures are nice drawings, very colorful but as a nature guide the information is too often incomplete or inadequate for clean identification. Some items (animals for instance) include details (like tracks) that for the other animals are not shown. For trees, some have bark depictions and others don't. The range maps are often (from my experience) inaccurate. Funghi information was totaly inadequate to differentiate one from the other. This book might be good for a coffee table but woefully short as a field guide. Many items in each section are not included... Then again, it is ""Readers Digest"" material.The general overal quality reminds me of the difference between doing an information search on line with something like MSEncarta and the information you would find at a well equipped library. Personally, I require as accurate and complete information as possible when it comes to Nature Querries. This Publication is ""puff""."
4,Great for beginners,"This book is really great for beginners. Instead of taking a traditional approach for theoretical learning of a language, It takes a practical approach by introducing dialogues between 2 or more people and then going into the verbs and nouns and vocabulary introduced in that dialogue.This gives enough confidence to start to speak after first few lessons.Lessons are short and therefore motivates older learners to sit and go through the whole lesson without distraction or boredom.Besides that cultural notes and pronunciation explanation helps understand the text better."
4,Great for beginner,It's a great coursebook for beginner. I love the wallet phrase card. It contains most daily phrases one would use as a tourist in Mexico.
4,Helpful for Beginners,"Used in a class, this book was helpful. The focus tends to be Spanish for travelers. It includes the familiar forms of the pronoun you (tu) as well as vosotros for a group of more than one ""yous"". Neither is helpful for the beginning Spanish speaker who is unlikely to be speaking Spanish to close friends & family. It would have ben less confusing with practice dialogue that eliminated those verb conjugations."
4,Spanish book,"The book and CD disc's are a great resource for my daughter. She uses the CD's alot to review the sounds for the spanish words she is practicing. The book is easy to use, it has many vocabulary lists to look through. I wish for the price I paid for this book it was a hardcover. I was a little disappointed about that. Overall a good quality and we use it alot."
4,"Soul, part 1","This is vol. 1 of a 3-part BBC documentary, called simply ""Soul"", on the spiritual implications of modern cosmology and quantum physics, with thoughts from both theologians and noted scientists. Can be watched as a stand-alone without the other volumes."
3,Wonderful Music,"The Music in this musical is some of the prettiest music I have ever heard. I think the story drags a little.to be fair I have never seen the show on stage, just listened to the recording. I know I am missing alot till I see it preformed"
3,A review without having seen the show,"We purchased this CD because we have enjoyed each of the previous shows by these writers, and it looks as though this show won't make it to London.On first hearing, I have to expess my disappointment, as there are echoes , somewhat faint, of each of the previous works, without any very memorable or outstanding numbers, but after a number of plays, some sublties do come through....it was the only CD we had with us on a 4 day drive through France!!...and I now know most of the words and some of the tunes.I must say the casting, at least vocally, of Queen Elizabeth was a complete disaster...she has none of the regality or gravitas you would expect, and thus marrs the effect of the numbers she is in. All-in-all, however, for fans of the composers, this CD will form an important part of any collection. Let us hope they manage something with a bit more originality next time."
3,Composer becomes student.,"The score has genius of a student breaking into theatre.After masterpieces of Les Miz,Martin Guerre and Miss Saigon whathappened?These are great works.It is still worth listening to."
3,Good CD,"This was certainly not a hit show and with good reason. Still, so-so Boubil and Schonberg is often better than many others best works, and I enjoyed the music on this well produced CD."
2,What happened to the Magic?,"I found this recording somewhat lacking.Queen Victoria sounds like a pale, underfed school girl. Her voice is weak and pitch is a fickle friend. Her vibrato (wobble) is over the top and completely out of character for her voice.It's such a rich story, full of Celtic innuendo, except the music doesn't reflect that culture as much as I had expected.Celtic melodies are built on the Pentatonic Scale, but all the songs use modern scales and melodic intonations. The only music that delights in the celtic musical history are the instrumental numbers.Overall, I was quite dissapointed, especially by the creative team who spawned les miserables.For swuch a rich and passionate story, the music rarely reflects this.Such a shame."
5,Amazing Music!,"I bought this at the recommendation of a friend, and because I loved Les Mis. I wasn't expecting much, due to the reviews I had read previously, but I was really blown away. The melodies are simpler that Les Mis, but that is part of their charm and beauty. Stephanie J Block does a fantastic job as Grace, and the rest of the cast is really wonderful too. If you like celtic music or some of the quieter, softer Les Mis songs; A heart full of love, Bring him home... There is a very good chance you will fall in love with the music of The Pirate Queen as well."
3,"Music gets an 'A' for effort, 'D' for memorable.","While the soundtrack is rousing, and certainly moves the story along, it is kind of lackluster. There weren't any of the songs that really stuck with us a week after the show. Sad, as the show itself was both visually stunning and enchanting.Still, the soundtrack is good listening music, even if you won't be able to catch a song or two on the radio."
2,Double Disappointment,"Boubil and Shonberg's reputations were, until this release, ranking in the highest realms of musical theater. I saw this performance live and hoped that my disappointment there could be alleviated by listening again to the score. I was wrong, dreadfully wrong. There is not one memorable selection in the lot. Shun this recording."
1,Just plain dull,"Not much to recommend here. If you've heard ""Les Mis"", ""Miss Saigon"" and ""Martin Guerre"" (or any of the variations of ""Riverdance""), you've heard this score. Dull, Dull, Dull."
2,"""SORRY""","I too waited for this because of ""Les Miz"" and even if the reviews were not the greates in the world for ""Les Miz"" the show was wonderful and taken to heart with the people.......and as someone who has seen many many musicals I always tell people that I beleive that ""Les Miz"" was one of the greatest musicals written for the stage. That said-I can not say that for the ""Pirate Queen"". Sorry, I felt this show does not cut it and it lost a lot of money proving that point. I will never understand why they did not open this show in London first, where the material was better know. There other musicals were so much better and I am looking forward to the next."
4,Food for contemplation,"I have been listening to Electronica for the past 8 years, and over that time my tastes have matured, from the Pop mainstream which brought me in, to the many sub-genre's and intellectual musings of the modern musician which have kept me a devoted listener of electronica.I first listened to Ezekiels CD while reading a Wired Magazine, but soon found myself distracted from the reading and involved in the music. I followed the tracks on a sort of journey through modern sound and purpose. The full body of this CD is complex and insightfull of the modern world we live, work, and play in...connected by whirs, rings, and a rythm. It gave me a fresh feeling of calm and comfort so antithetic to an average NYC day."
5,"Pets, Heaven,and Hope","The title of this book really grabbed my attention, and I'm sure it will grab others also. The Biblical references, along with the slow and methodical way that the thought processes were directed to the hope of a future reuniun with a beloved pet, were more than adequate to the task of keeping one's interest throughout this book. All people who love their pets owe themselves the pleasure of reading this book, increasing their knowledge of God's plan for salvation, and satisfying their hunger for reassurance that their pets might indeed be with them in Heaven."
5,A Must Read for Pet Owners,"This is a very unique book which offers a lot of hope to those who have lost pets. I've always been under the impression that animals won't be in heaven, but this gives an entirely different outlook which is both Biblical and inspirational. It was very touching and encouraging. I would recommend this book to all animal lovers!"
4,Scissor Sisters' Debut Album,"The first time I heard the Scissor Sisters was over the internet on the Chris Moyles' Show (BBC Radio 1 England; I have yet to hear their music on any stations in Canada). Having only listened to this album once, my first impression was that they sounded Beatlesque. The first track (and my current favourite), ""Laura"" is a prime example. The rest of the album reminded me of a mixture of the Pet Shop Boys and other similar 80's bands. Initially, I thought they were a British band (style/appearance, lyrics, tour dates), and couldn't figure out why they kept referring to places in the States...mystery solved - they're from New York. Overall, a good album with catchy tracks. I bought the British version with the bonus tracks - very nice."
5,Excellent positive teaching materials for all ages,"Character Sketches: From the Pages of Scripture, Illustrated in the World of Nature, Volume IIExcellent material for family, school or church. This is truly a classic!"
3,A good starting place,"The key words on the cover of this book are ""Arranged By."" This is not the actual music that you hear on ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and the other magical Guaraldi CD's and on the TV specials; it is ""arrangements"" of that music; which means simplified versions.However, for pianists who want to take a first step towards seeking out the hippest cat who ever touched a keyboard, this collection of sheet music is a good start. I haven't yet found a better collection, and there are moments of magic in the chords. To really go further, however, you'll have to listen to the CD's, run back to the piano; listen to the CD's, run back to the piano, until you've worn a trench in your carpet between your stereo and the bench."
3,"Fine, but not my level","I'm more single-notes with right had and simple beat with left hand. This has cords, eighth notes, staccatos, sharps, and flats. Personally, it's not my level. I'm better with Easy Piano Music. If you're like me, choose an easier piece. If you're better than me, feel free to buy this. I have nothing wrong with the book itself.I'll list the songs it gives:Air MusicBaseball ThemeBlue Charlie BrownCharlie Brown All Stars (Theme Music)Charlie Brown ThemeChristmas Time is HereHappiness ThemeHe's Your Dog, Charlie BrownLinus and LucyLove will ComeMasked Marvel MusicOh, Good Grief!Peppermint PattyRed BaronSchroederSkatingYou're in Love, Charlie Brown"
2,Music Too Simplified,"I would not recommend purchasing this item. If you are most interested in learning the most popular Guaraldi song ""Linus and Lucy"" you will probably be quite disappointed with this sheet music. While the music is quite easy for intermediate pianists to learn, the melody sounds quite off. The song is written in the key of C, which while this is easier to play than the original music I am sure, the music seems very unnatural. This version of ""Linus and Lucy"" doesn't sound right at all later in the song as well. If you are more interested in learning a variety of Peanuts songs with relative ease this book is a good purchase. Songs such as ""Skating"" sound much closer to the actual music and are also pretty easy to play. Overall, I think this compilation sacrifices quality for simplicity."
3,Easier version of Guaraldi music,"Fun book but not the original scores and a little ""dumbed"" down. Good for beginners but if you're looking for the real stuff, don't buy here."
5,"To become ""non-vanilla""","Too many therapists who have little knowledge of the behaviors in question nonetheless attempt to treat individuals who engage in sexually unusual behavior. This book is both a primer and a warning. It shows therapists how their eyes must be open and non-judgemental if they are to be of any help at all. In my private practice, I often lend this book to clients to derive the benefit of its understanding as we mutually explore the behaviors in question. Sargent's chapter is an absolute gem."
4,"The story of Marie Antoinette, the last Queen of France","The book tells of the tragic life of Marie Antoinette; how the frivolous, pleasure-loving and greatly misunderstood Queen danced her way to revolution and disaster."
4,"Exciting, Factual, and Enjoyable reading","This was my first book by Victoria Holt, and also my first book on Marie Antoinette. I knew a little about her from my college history class, but that was all. This story provided more information than class, and moved along quickly. It was very exciting at times, and written in a way that was very believable. The book contained real quotations from various sources, which was also interesting. It would be helpful for the reader to have *some* background information on the time period and/or Marie Antoinette in order to make reading the story a little smoother. There are a TON of names and places mentioned, which can make it confusing... but not enough dates. Dates are mentioned only here and then. My one complaint is that several times all French sentences were used with no translation... so since I don't speak French, they detracted from the story. I would have liked to have known the translations to those."
4,Complexity - a holistic approach,"This videotape is an enjoyable way to become exposed to current concepts in complexity as applied to life. This tape is unique in not being a conventional biology or mathematics work, but includes the viewpoints of leading philosophers and theologians as well. This tape is narrated by psychiatrist Anthony Clare, who notes the contrast of his earlier religious education with the scientific reductionism of his medical education."
5,computacion,"Hola como estan, me gustaria comprar este libro, porque es lo mejor y lo he buscado por mucho tiempoRICARDO B. corona@elko.net"
4,some further clarification,"I would like to add to the reviews which - correctly - state that the NRSV is a perfectly acceptable bible for Catholics to use for personal study. In fact, the NRSV New Testament is a quite literal translation from the Greek. (I cannot speak for the OT since I don't know Hebrew) Only those who know little about the original languages would discredit the NRSV.As for the RSV Ignatius Bible being a Catholic Bible, that, too, is an interesting misconception. The RSV is/was a widely used Protestant Bible. It only ""became"" a Catholic Bible when the apocryphal books were added to it for sale to Catholics as a backlash against the NRSV."
4,NRSV is just fine for Catholics,"Even though the Catholic Church uses the New American Bible (contrary to what a previous reviewer has said) in our liturgies, it is true that other translations are not allowed at liturgy. But for private study, these translations are perfectly acceptable. I prefer the NRSV BECAUSE of its more inclusive language. I am a woman who dislikes sexism in any form, and that includes language.As for the Ignatius Bible, well that would be fine for a very conservative Catholic. The NRSV is a wonderful translation. I wish, though, it would find gender neutral terms for God -- or at least balance the masculine terms out with feminine terms."
2,Finale Print Music Definitely Not The Last Word,"I bought it for its sheet music scanning feature since I am often asked to transpose music to lower keys for fellow choir members whose range ""just ain't what it used to be"". Scanning works but it accepts only black and white tif files. It was difficult to insure black and white scans. Once the scans were made, the resultant transcriptions contained numerous errors(about one third of the entries). Many editing features are quirky and the help files are not easy to use since they are organized in a ""user's manual descriptive"" format(Who reads a Manual cover to cover before using anything, except possibly a chain saw?). On the plus side, it does display bar lines below and above the staff, making insertion of these notes easier than with Noteworthy Composer.The numerous scan errors make it difficult to justify the increased price(double)that of Noteworthy Composer."
5,Finale print music,"This software program is easy to navigate, clear in instruction and highly versatile for all levels of musical ability. The human playback feature was especially appreciated and made my creations that much more exciting to hear and easy to edit."
3,Good Solid Trilogy,"Let me start by saying this; War of the Lance it is not. With that said it is still a pretty good trilogy. One of the first things you will notice are the dramatic changes in the wold we have all come to love. The first being no Magic! I really thought this would ruin the book but it didn't. It just add a few new interesting twists. Next is the absence of the gods. Once again not a big deal just different. Where The War of Souls seems to really fall behind The War of The Lance is with its Characters. They just don't really jump off the page at you like WOTL characters did. And when it was all said and done you just don't feel like you have a whole lot invested in them emotionally.Now don't get me wrong, War of Souls is definitly a trilogy that will entertain and will make you glad you read it. Just don't go in thinking your going to read another War of The Lance."
4,Bought these for a gift,"I bought these books as a gift for my husband, who was chewing through the rest of this series so fast, I wasn't sure they would get here in time. I am sad to say, he was disgusted with the change of characters and the total ""change"" from the one previous. He set them aside and refuses to read them. I am sure they are wonderful books, and I love that they came in this trilogy box set. I will read them myself one of these days, when I am done with my supernatural kick I am on."
4,great cotinuation of series!,Once again These Authors weave a tantalizing tale that keeps the reader enthralled to the end.....and wanting more. I WILL get the next series as well!
1,Very large books with little content,"I managed to finish these books, but just barely. They are the only dragonlance novels I read and then promply sold rather than add to my collection. I have read all the core novels (tanis, rasitin, tasselhof, ect.) and a the ledgend of huma, kaz the minitor and the elf trilogy. I state this to only prove my adoration for the dragonlance saga.However, these books are terrible. Dragons of summer's flame wasn't even this bad. As with the series in general they wander, but this time it is too an extreme and the story they are telling serves no point. I was never engaged with the story, tasselhof has become a bore and almost irritating. The only gratifying part of the novels is the emergance of Fizban who never gets old to me.In the end, if you are on the fence about these novels DO NOT BUY THEM. However, I wouldn't listen to reviewers either so I understand the mistake you will soon commit."
1,Not worth the money,I was really disappointed in this series. Using time travel as a plot devise should put the authors on notice that they've gone to the well in this world one too many times and they might want to consider starting with new characters rather than rehashing old characters time after time after time. Their best work yet has been the original Dragonlance series.
3,Catchy,"Although it lacks the intensity and originality of the ""War of the Lance"" or the ""Legends"" trilogy, this book is easily an addictive one. After one or two chapters you are hooked.Another good work of Margater Weis and Tracy Hickman that proves that, when writing about Krynn, NO ONE else should step in. No offense, but the firts stories written after the ""Chaos War"" trilogy were very weak."
2,Good unless you're a fan of the original series,"If Weis/ Hickman had written this series first, and then the other ""Dragonlance"" novels as prequels, I might have warmed up to it, but having been spoiled on world of magic, I can't really enjoy a world without it or warm up to these characters who lack the charm and sympathy of the original cast. We could see ourselves, good and evil, in the Heroes of the Lance. These folks just aren't as interesting."
2,Not my favorite,"Im not a huge fan of this one. I like the original group so much better, the chemistry is just not as good with this group."
5,not a happy movie,"This is one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time - in English or otherwise. With all the hysteria about Iran, it is easy to forget that there is suburbia in Iran just like in California. In fact, at times I forgot that I was watching in a movie shot in Iran. If you are interested in seeing an Iranian movie that is not a fairly tale, see this movie. Real metropolitian people, living real lives - of course with a modern Persian twist."
4,Works Great with the UMM Program,"You have to use this nutrition guide with the Ultimate Muscle Mass program by the same author. The 2 really go hand in hand.It is a short little program, but the calorie cycling made sense to me. And it worked. I actually liked estimating my maintenance calorie level, tweaking intake, and coming up with a comprehensive individual plan.The nutrition information is straight-forward. It's really the unique schedule that makes this program work. It's no magic pill, but it certainly helped me get in great shape. So overall I recommend it with the ultimate muscle mass program, though the UMM program is clearly the key."
4,"LeAnn Thieman, author","In this remarkable book Cherie Clark recounts with great emotion and historical accuracy the events surrounding the Vietnam Orphan Airlift. When I wrote my book, This Must Be My Brother, I shared my isolated story from my dramatic involvement in the Airlift. I coudn't wait to read Cherie's book and I clamored to learn ""the rest of the story"". I am amazed and in awe of the horror and love endured by Cherie and those facilitating the rescue of nearly 3000 orphans.This incredible book is written with honesty and honor. I applaud Cherie Clark for inspring the world by sharing her heart and her soul and her story."
1,AWFUL product that burns,This product dispenses almost no steam but just leaks water onto your clothes (boiling hot water). DO NOT BUY THIS
1,Didn't work for me...,"Simply put, it doesn't work. Well, perhaps it can work on some types of fabrics/garments in very specific (or limited) situations, but it didn't work on mine.You can't manage to get a continuous flow of steam, even if you keep on pumping the button frequently (what it doesn't support, as a matter of fact, because there's a limit of bursts of steam it can shoot out in a row before ""reloading"").I returned it to seller (Brand Variety, that refunded me without problems, no question asked).Not recommended."
3,Not what I expected!,"This steamer is very little and confortable to take during a trip. Although, it holds a very little amount of water that makes you put water into it at all times. It takes long time for you to take the wrinkles out of your clothes."
2,Steamed,It doesn't steam like the steamer it replaced. It for sure is portable and should only be used in a squeeze.
5,quite a voice,"angela mccluskey has one of those pricelessly unique voices that can do no wrong -- a deeply resonant, almost scary lower range, a husky, jazzy, squeaky-creaky belting upper range, and a whole host of bizarre colors in between. there's so much personality in her voice, so much style, that each word merits close attention.there are some truly great songs on this disc (""it's been done,"" ""perfect girl 11,"" ""long live i""), and some lesser material, but even on the less stellar songs the voice of a truly captivating artist brings the material to life. she sounds better here than she's ever sounded. a must-have for fans of beth orton, portishead, billie holiday, janis joplin, macy gray -- for anyone who appreciates a uniquely compelling voice."
1,Paperback not worth it,"Bought the paperback for a humorous take on Latin Grammar, but about a third of the pages were so badly rendered as to be unreadable. Don't waste your time."
1,Great for rotting your railing.,"These round pots hug my railing so well that they keep the rail moist. I can grow mold really well in the wood even though its treated wood. There are no holes in the center section of the pot to let water through, but holes are not needed. Rain seeps in from the edge of the pot and since the pot is seated so well on the railing, it refuses to let the wood dry out. We didn't even have a hard rain and after a week the wood was still very wet. I had to remove the pots to dry the railing out. If you raise the pot so that air can get under, then the pot is not firm on the rail and would fall off."
3,Hit or Miss,"Depends on what you are looking for, but some of these lessons were a total hit, while some were really not helpful. The book really should be called ""Mini lessons for revision of narrative writing"" because most of the lessons were focused on narrative strategies. In the future, I will use these lessons only for my narrative unit. On the plus side, the handouts themselves were worth the money for my narrative unit, particularly the intro-conclusion lessons."
1,poor design,"I could not get the cap off the water tank so i returned this item.what poor design! it is rounded with just a few little raised lines for gripping. nevertheless i was never able to get it open to use the dang thing. returned for a different model with a raised ""bar shape"" on the cap that you can actually grip to get it open. if you have even the slightest problem opening jars (and i have 100lb grip strength as measured by a PT), then pass on this item. if its this hard to open before its even turned on, imagine how difficult with steam pressure. if i could give it a zero, i would just because of the annoyance of having to return the thing."
2,Mr Coffee ECM20 espresso maker,"It lasted/worked ok for about 3 years using it once or twice a week, but then in rapid succession it started breaking: first, the clip to hold the filter in the basket so you could empty it while hot. Then the handle of the the carafe. The latest item was the handle for the basket. It was cheap..."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"The same exact parts started breaking on my machine, except I've only owned this machine for only a year and a half. The clip on the brew basket was first, the handle of the caraffe second, and now the entire handle has broken off of the brew basket because the screw was rusted inside. I have been searching for a replacement brew basket online and cannot find one so I will just have to purchase an entire new esspresso maker. I have only used this machine an average of once per week since I bought it."
2,Poorly made,We use our machine daily. Sometimes twice daily to make espresso. The machine started falling apart. The carafe handle broke then the metal filter basket handle broke. Our machine prior to this lasted much longer and never fell apart. This machine is at most two years old. Very disappointing.
2,Works Okay,"I have just gone through my third one of these in five years. For the price it works okay. The last one ~ the on/off knob broke off. The other two just quit working. I think that old saying, ""The Third Times A Charm"" really doesn't apply here. I'm going to look for something a little more spendy and hope for the best. I really wouldn't recommend it."
3,"works great, just a little bit on the small side.","I got this for my birthday back in Jan. Works great, but I still need to buy a frothing cup. It works great but makes so little that I really don't get it out when I have more than a couple of people over. I would still recomend it for the pesron who wants to have a small personal machine."
2,Okay but lacking.,"This book had a lot of helpful facts about LLCs, but no guidance really in forming one, or whether you should form an LLC or corporation. The state-by-state appendix of laws and contact information hadn't been updated since 1997. The sample operating agreement was not on the disk, so you couldn't tailor it and use it for your company."
3,Hmm... what should I say?,"Good for beginners. Other than that I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. After reading NOLO's edition and For Dummies, this book looks like an online article."
5,Chewable breath refresner,"My pet loves this product i give him once a day, and his breath smells minty, i will buy again"
4,Good tool,Works great. I am pleased with tool function and quality. I would recommend this product. The price was in the reasonable range.
4,An exciting muktifunction stylus,"Four-function Executive Laser Point is elegant and functional. All promised functions work very well and efficiently. Light is consistent and useful, the pointer is really bright. The reason why I didn't add the fifth star is that if PDA stylus would be also able to work on an iPhone, it would be perfect."
1,Not Sure,"Haven't seen the pens yet, and can't seem to get a receipt for the purchase. so far, not sure what to think."
4,Inside the mind of Bobby Darin,"Of the six published bios about Darin, this is the most fascinating because it takes us inside the mind of the man and explores many of his political and moral beliefs as well as his view on music and performance. Darin was an intensely political animal with very left-wing libertarian beliefs. This book addresses all the gaps in Spacey's movie and other bios. After all, we need to know what made someone like Bobby Darin write and record all those protest songs. Here you will find some answers.My only quibble with this book is that it is badly edited and many sections are simply repeated to flesh out the pages."
3,hmm,"I was shipped a 64MB version instead of the 128MB version. Either way, its better than the GeForce 256 I had. Would have returned it for the 128MB version I ordered but being lazy and inpatient I just keep it. I bought it using a free gift certificate given to me, so I wasnt to concerned about the price, which was about right anyways."
1,not worth it,"I'm a tall man and wanted calf-length socks;but,the upper elastic unraveled after the first washing. Very expensive socks for ""disposable""."
3,Not pleased.. way too big,"Not pleased. I expected this to be much smaller, this is huge. Another thing is, it does not have a small metal clip, it has a big green plastic clip. So disappointed because I really wanted a patrick star keychain."
2,Very Disappointed!!,"This dryer is heavier and took longer to dry my hair than the 15 year old dryer I was replacing. I hate it. Also, the on/off button is right where you hold the dryer, so it's hard to use it without turning it off by mistake. Very annoying. I'm sending it back."
2,Gene....Gene....Gene....,"I actually went to the Melbourne part of Gene's tour and found it tedious, self absorbed and clearly unplanned. Surprising when you consider Simmon's attention to detail on so many other projects.It's taken me years to finally have to courage to sit through this DVD...It has been obviously heavily edited back to include endless ""look at me with these girls"" moments. The lecture bits are OK but his ideas are explained better in his books.I must add that I also bought his Family Jewels series and really enjoyed it."
3,Not as entertaining or sincere as 'Family Jewels',"This DVD predates 'Gene Simmons Family Jewels,' and it's sort of its prototype. But on ""Tongues"" Simmons is much more interested in promoting a more startling, or brash, persona than he does on 'Jewels,' and for me it's less interesting for that.This DVD is much more obviously self-aggrandizing, if less can be said of anything Simmons produces -- for instance, his jokes before the live audiences are smile-worthy, but obviously not worth the BIG laughs he seemingly gets out of them; one suspects the laughter is heavily dubbed or edited-in.There are genuinely interesting/thought-provoking tidbits here and there, but you get this better and more sincerely in 'Jewels,' which by the way I think is just great. I even have 75-year-old friends that I've gotten hooked on it, because it's so genuinely clever and lovable.The video for 'Firestarter' is pretty fun, but overall this DVD is a step down from the high standard set by 'Family Jewels' IMO."
2,Not entertaining at all...,"This DVD is pretty boring and is an obvious attempt to cash in once more on die-hard KISS fans. Even when he tries to be funny, he just simply isn't. Also, I disagree with most of the things said. I'm not bashing the DVD for that, though, because his opinions are HIS opinions. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it just simply is not very entertaining, and he dosen't say much that I haven't already heard him say before. I immediately listed my copy for sale on Half dot com after viewing it. Stick with the music Gene."
2,Mostly things you can put Edame on top of,"This is not really ""about"" edemame, it is basically lots of meats, salads, dishes you can put edameme next to, in, or on top of, which you could probably figure out on your own."
3,Not the same,"I've enjoyed the other four books in this series greatly, but this one was too much of a jump. I'm not saying that it was not well writen and interesting, just a surprise for someone who was expecting a certain type of vampire.In this book several of interesting characters come together in Las Vegas, which happens to be a very popular resting place for light-addicted vampires (wish she left that out, it was just too weird.) The group of three vampires and one human need to stop a crazed magician, as well as a fanatic who wants to kill all vampires.This just wasn't as intersting and unique as the previous novels. I hope she goes back to her orginal format."
1,not like the rest of the series,This book was not like the rest of the series. First of all I think Valentine should be staked along with Geoffrey. Second of all i think Char should of had a better time of it in the book and actually bite her boy friend.This book was just way off track with the rest of the series. If your going to make this big of a change in the story line you should do it gradually. My advice is to read the first books but skip this one and read the next one to see if it is any better. The first books in this series were really good but this ones not even worth burning. Susan your way off with this one. Go Back to your original story line. That was really good.
2,impossible to hear the music!,"Had I known that it is utterly impossibly to hear the music on this DVD, I wouldn't have purchased it. What's dancing without music? Unfortunately the music is so low and the talking so loud, that you can only hear the music if you turn the TV up to maximum volume. So basically you are dancing along to Hough's squeaky, trying-to-be-sexy-and-failing-miserably voice.I would not recommend this video."
3,Not nearly as good as her other DVD,"If you're torn between this one and Cardio Ballroom, definitely choose Cardio Ballroom. This one's not nearly as good."
2,Not made with beginners in mind.,"This video is NOT for beginners. Even having several years of dancing under my belt, I found it difficult to keep up with. Instead of focusing on her feet, or the body part performing the move, the camera goes to her face or stomach...not so helpful. While doing the dances, I became VERY frustrated and considered just getting onto a treadmill. I'm going to give it a few more tries before giving up, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend. So unless you are talented in hip-hop dancing, save yourself time, money, and frustration and try a different dance workout."
2,Disappointed Mom,I felt so out of place with this video! This is good for teenagers/college age kids who likes to dance. I wish I could return it .:(
2,she's perky and a good dancer,she moves way too fast for me...i had to do the first ten minutes of the video three times and i still don't have it down all the way
2,JustDance!,This video was harder then I thought. I wish she would have slow it down more. I wasn't even comftable with the steps yet and she was already moving on. So I was tryen to catch up my breathe and tryen to catch up with the steps:(
2,"eh, could be better","well it could've been a lot better, but it wasn't. her direction on movements was horrible. the music needed to be louder, it is very hard to get excited to dance when there's no music and just her talking. I ordered this dvd, and the ballroom workout, and in both the music was hardly audible. i wouldn't recommend buying this at all, i went through both videos and it was horrible, very disappointed with this, i don't write reviews hardly every but i needed to write this one. after i watched this video i went onto netflix and did the crunch salsa workout and was impressed with it. if you want a workout and have netflix go with the crunch series."
4,Fun,The routines are really fun once you get the hang of the steps. It's a little hard to follow. So not a dancer over here and my coordination isn't so great either.
3,Not great for beginners!,"My year old daughter and I picked this as something we could do together. We tried it for the first time this morning and we both had a very difficult time with the moves. The camera work was horrible. It said if you were a beginner to watch the girl to the right of the screen, but it hardly ever panned over to her! Not to mention that when Julianne was on the camera, most of the time it was on her face. I am NOT a dancer at all. In trying to keep up with the moves, I did break a sweat. I will try this again and post another review as to how the second time goes."
3,Great for intermediate dancers but not beginners,"I've always wanted to dance as my workout so I thought this product was perfect. Well, it is. She is a great dancer and very cheerful throughout the whole video; however, the video is not for beginners. I have gone to plenty of dance classes where the teacher takes you step by step and repeat over and over again. She doesn't do that in this video. I had to rewind and play it in slow motion to actually see what she's doing. If you already started working out (steps/dance routine), then this video will be great for you. If you're a beginner, I suggest you find something else and then buy this because it's a good dvd after all."
3,No symmetry,"This wasn't too hard for me to catch onto, like some other dance work-outs. HOWEVER, I was pretty surprised how very little attention was paid to symmetry. As somebody who has had several sports injuries, I don't recommend working one side of your body (be it one leg or one arm), and not he other. It's just an injury waiting to happen. Next time I do the video, I'm going to be sure to switch sides!"
2,Not for low impact,"I've had my dvd for a week now and have worked hard everyday to get just the first workout. I have improved but I really think this dvd is not for people who need to lose weight. There are moves that overweight people cannot and should not do such as jumps. The jumps are not big but for an overweight person it could be hard on the knees and ankles. As a person who loved dancing and was a cheerleader in my teens and 20's who could move with good coordination and little effort I was disappointed at how the movements did not seem to flow for me. I hope others find this dvd easier than I did. I did like Julianne's great enthusiasm and positive attitude. Unfortunately, it was not enough for me to continue to use this dvd."
2,Too repetitive and where is the music?!,"I was excited to try this DVD, but it just did not work for me. There's hardly any variety and my heart rate didn't rise. Moreover, how can you have a dance video with little to no music? The whole point of dancing is getting into the groove so you forget that you are exercising. This workout left me feeling bored and annoyed."
1,"I didn't finish the workout, nor do I have any desire to do again.",I just found it didn't click with me. I started the workout but didn't finish it. I haven't had any desire to pop it back in and learn the steps.
2,Huffing with Julianne,"Don't get this video unless you are:a. obsessed with Julianne Houghb. a dancerc. between the ages of 7 and 27The routine is difficult (some might say impossible), Julianne (who likely works out 6 hours a day herself) is out of breath doing it, and the audio is poor. You can hear Julianne, but not the music. When you turn it up, you just hear Julianne louder--not the music--which you absolutely NEED to pull you through this routine.There are no ""dance steps"", it's just a made-up bump and grind that is repetitive and pretty much (sorry) boring. Julianne is cute, but she has no clue of what the general public is incapable of."
3,Has Promise,This would be a very good workout and alot of fun. The problem is learning the dance steps. There is a lesson on the dvd but it is very hard to get the dance steps down so that you can get the full benifit of the workout.
3,Should've bought a Gym Membership Instead,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas. I was so excited to use it that I instantly opened it and started the workout. This DVD is not bad, but it definitely is not great either. You can tell that Julianne is fun and excited to be there, but she seems very inexperienced in teaching through a DVD. I have danced for 22 years and so the moves weren't difficult, which I liked, but at the same time she doesn't cue you in and there isn't music that goes to it, it's more background music. I like music that gets me pumped up and excited to dance and it just wasn't there. I should've had my husband splurge and buy me a gym membership to Golds or 24 hour fitness so I could do a dance class there. The reason I wanted this is because I have a 1 year old and I wanted something I could do from home. I'll still work out to it because I love to workout, but it doesn't motivate me like I was hoping it would."
1,don't recommend,"I do not recommend this video if you are serious about working out.It goes from camera angle to camera angle, you can't even see what she is doing. I ended up returning it to get my money back."
3,It's alright...,"This is not the dvd for a beginner to dance. Other than two of the dances, the rest are rather difficult for a beginning dancer. Thus this exercise dvd can be more discouraging than fun and encouraging. I would recomment the cardio ballroom dvd instead."
2,not what i expected,"Judging by the commercial I thought this DVD would be fun Zumba-like dancing. Instead, I felt like I was being taught chroeography for a Brittany Spears video. I'm not a professional dancer auditioning for a part, so ""snaking my body"" and ""whipping my hair around"" isn't want I'm looking for in a dance excercise video. Extremely disappointed."
2,Dance with Julianne,I have been dancing for years and thought this would be a great dvd. I need advanced and this was slow. It was difficult watching a perfect figure half dressed-could have chosen a better outfit.
1,Waste,"After 10 minutes into it, I popped it out of the DVD player, put it in the case, then threw it right in the garbage. She runs through the routines/steps too quickly for the average person. I'm no stranger to dance and am highly coordinated, but I just couldn't hack it. If you're already a dance pro, then this is made for you. I turned back to my old friend Gilad Janklowicz/Bodies in Motion, check out his DVDs."
2,i would if i could,"If I could play this dvd I'm sure it would be good. But I live in so am in the ""wrong zone""this happens often with american dvd's - so frustrating, some play and others don't. How about making dvd'sEuropean friendly - America is not the only market in the world!"
5,"Great Workout, Good Dances for Beginners","I've purchased many other dance DVD's that end up being really corny with cheesy music. I've also attended Hip Hop style dance classes at my gym and always find myself confused, uncoordinated, and frustrated.This DVD is the first I've found that really works for me. There is a simple warm up, three different dance segments and a cool down. I love it! Julianne makes it fun, laughing and goofing off while trying to learn makes it so much less stressful. She also has a great section on the DVD that helps break down the moves. I found my self playing some parts on slow while learning, but it didn't take too long at all to pick them up. I would say it's a medium intensity workout that will get you sweating, but wont make you sore the next day."
2,This is not exactely what I call dance,"I loved her first Cardio Ballroom video and I was so excited when this one came out. Sorry, this is not what I call dance. When I do an exercise video I want to feel like I am learning something. If I wanted to shake my but and throw my head around, I don't need a video for that. I am a dance exercise video junkie, and I must say that this is the most disapointing one yet."
1,No good,"My wife says this video is more lame than a pool workout for seniors with floaties. If you wanna just mess around then maybe you will like it, if you wanna get tone then dont bother."
2,NOT for novice dancers!!!!,"This workout DVD is maddening. Julianne moves extremely quickly from move to move and gives basically no instruction. Unless you have a background in dance, this workout is impossible to follow. Julianne spends more time flipping her hair, looking sexy and making screaming noises than she does instructing. I'm annoyed that I wasted my money on this DVD. I attempted to do it on 3 occassions. I have now given up and have listed it on the Amazon marketplace for sale. I would not suggest this DVD for a novice dancer."
3,Its Okay....,"Julianne is fun, sexy, but she is NOT a dance instructor. The moves in this DVD are fun and upbeat, but it is almost impossible to follow her. She does not count out the moves and really show you how to do them, she just flies right through each routine. You end up spending more time rewinding the DVD and watching it over again trying to learn the moves than actually dancing or working out. Once you are familiar with the routines, I could see how this would be a great workout once you actually learn the moves. Unless you are experienced dancer or a super fast learner, I'd look elsewhere."
3,ok,"Was expecting fun, energetic moves, easy to follow, but didnt really keep the fun going through the exercise like i had hoped."
4,Good dancing exercise,Really enjoyed the workout with Julianne. She's a good dancer and really gets you motivated to get moving with some dancing exercise. Would like to try another one of her dvd's.
3,"Decent workout, not as difficult as I thought","I love dance-oriented workouts but I actually didn't think this dvd was 'difficult' enough. I thought I would have worked more muscle groups but I wasn't even sore the next day. I also expected more from the cool down portion (intense stretching, ab work, etc.) but it was shortlived.The dance choreography is fun, and easy to pick up, but I wish the workout would have been a little more comprehensive."
4,another good workout,"Considering this is a dance workout, it's very good. Liked the choreography and Julianne is a very good instructor and motivator. I would say the choreography is tougher than the ballroom one but the more difficult points are broken down for you to practice slowly.As always, wish they would find a way to teach like a regular dance class as if you are standing behind the instructor and can see their front in the mirror."
3,"Turn up the music, please!","I was looking for an exercise DVD with great techno music. I searched and searched but there didn't seem like much selection. I came across Julianne's DVD. I was excited because there was an emphasis on fun, club type dance. I'm disappointed because the music is way too low to really get me moving. It would have been more helpful to slow down the routine and maybe count the steps out for us. I'm only on Day Two so hopefully with practice it'll be more fun."
2,Not what I expected...very boring.,"This DVD is not what I expected. I love to dance, but this was very boring & repetitive. I'm very disappointed that I actually paid money for this. I would not recommend this video."
1,No thanks,"I heard good things about her other DVDs, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It's really awful, to say the least. Like most reviewers said: you can't hear the music, there's little-to-no instruction, and is just very hard to follow. I found the instructor REALLY annoying with her constant 'wooing'. I can't recommend this to anyone, it's a huge disappointment."
2,not worth it.,I felt that the basic moves taught were taught too fast. It gives you no prep for some of the harder steps. It puts too much focus on hair flipping and head rolling. and most of the dvd is filled with interviews. So really not much time and content for the price you pay.
2,dance video review,This product did not take long to get to mailed to me. However the video itself is hard to keep up with. It seems a little fast paced for beginners.
3,quirky,this dvd was more interesting to the men in my house. maybe i am getting old but it was difficult for me to relate to julianne. she has some good instructions but suited to somebody already in good physical shape.
4,FUN!!!,"I really enjoyed this dance workout. The instructor Julianne Hough is very peppy and uplifting. You will sweat with this workout. There are three dance sections in this dvd and I have to say that I only liked the first dance which is called ""work it"". The other two workouts to me were a total bore which is the reason that I took one star off. I felt like it was not something that I would want to do every day but something to add into my rotation if I did another work out first. I do recommend getting this if you like dancey workouts."
1,Glad I didn't spend much for this one,Love Julianne but this dance/workout DVD was pretty sad. Very difficult to follow. Tried several times but ended up throwing in the trash. Glad I didn't spend much for this DVD. Not worth the cost to return. Unless you are a professional dancer you won't get it. Dont' waste your time or money.
5,Very fun and challenging!,"I bought Julianne's ballroom DVD after it came out last year and I have been in love with it ever since. Now I can't get enough of Just Dance! This video is even better for me than the ballroom dvd because it is a lot younger, modern, and more fun.I wouldn't recommend this to someone who has no dance experience or feels uncomfortable dancing because you really have to get into it and be confident and sexy to reap the benefits. This is definitely geared to the younger set, so unless you are a milf, moms stay away, you probably don't have the chops to enjoy this workout, and if you do, more power to you!The point is that this workout is really about having fun and allowing yourself to be cute and sexy and obviously a lot of people have a problem with that, judging by a few of the previous reviews."
1,Terribly sad amateurism,"First off, I'm a big Star Trek fan. Have attended conventions (back in the 70's), know every original series episode by heart. However, I'm also a musician and music lover.This is a terrible, terrible collection of songs. Nichols' voice is adequate; that's not the problem. I don't know the story of how this album got produced, but the songwriting in it is so embarrassingly poor that it puts a huge mark of shame on the otherwise distinguished career of Ms. Nichols. The production sounds like it was done on someone's PC, and is likewise extremely amateurish.Please do her a favor and don't buy this. Listen to this clips provided here and you'll see what I mean. How sad."
5,Older Rod Stewart music is the best!,"Purchased this album for the classic ""Stay with Me"" tune. The rest of the album did not disappoint! Ronnie Lane is great on this album!"
5,Miss Judy's fantasy!!!,"I think that this is one of the greastest rock and roll records ever. Rod, Ronnie, Ron, Kenny, Ian. You must make a new 2008 record"
3,A Nod Is as Good as a Wink...to a Blind Horse (gold disc),"I ordered 2 of the Faces (gold disc's) by Audio Fidelity, brand new from the online Amazon store. They came incomplete without the shown slipcover. At first they were going to replace them at no cost but come to find out Amazon was not able to send the slipcovers and instead offered a 20% discount. I would rather have had the slipcovers over the 20% refund but agreed to the discount over returning the items."
1,"A Nod, A Wink, And A Horse That Spits The Bit","Unless you're a Rod Stewart completist, you can pretty much leave this one be. Sloppy solipsism isn't exactly the way you give the Rolling Stones a run for their money, especially when you've got nothing to say other than what a kick you got out of crashing someone's party and then insulting them for actually letting you get away with it. It took a few years, but no few punk rockers pulled that one off with a lot more panache and a lot less self-congratulation than the Faces were drowning in. (Ronnie Lane's lovely ""Debris"" ultimately got a more sensible and sensitive treatment on his own later works.) And WHERE was the producer to pull the plug on Ron Wood while he was whacking out that caterwauling slide solo on ""That's All You Need"" - Elmore James he ain't. If you're a Faces fan, stay with ""Small Faces"" and ""Long Player"". THOSE were minor masterpieces of British drunk rock."
5,Best version Great Album!,"That Ron Wood slide guitar on the last track, That's All You Need, so big and beefy, you can hear every nuance. Just great guitar, another wonderful example of classic Ron Wood guitar licks on some of the best classic rock 'n roll of all time.The whole ablum is filled with great vocals, and great instrumental tone. Really a treat.The great mastering, cutting, production- it lets you get swept away by the great music! Audio Fidelity 24K Plus is a success, if you love this album you must hear this version!"
2,For One Song,"For Christmas this was on my wish list for ""Stay with Me"". I got my wish and had to absolutely laugh and cringe through the rest of this CD. To say ""Horrible"" would be tooooo kind but that only applies to the lyrics and singing.However, the redeeming factor for the second star was the actual music. If they had just kept their mouths shut, I probably would have given it a 4."
3,Wish it had lasted longer,"Without question, this iron provides great amounts of steam and presses beautifully. I have had mine for 15 months, and it developed a leak in the iron. It is made so that it can not be taken apart in an attempt to repair the leak. For the money, I think it should have lasted longer. Very frustrating to pay that much for an iron that oly lasted 15 months."
5,Great Discussion Starter with Adolescents,"I have recently been blessed with the privilege to lead group therapy at a residential home for adolescent girls. Peer pressure is one of the most influential forces in the lives of these girls. I needed a resource that would help me stimulate these young women to think critically about the people whom they allow in their lives.This book does an amazing job of presenting true-to-life scenarios to be acted out by group participants. Each scenario ends with an unresolved problem, which is proceeded by thought-provoking questions for group discussion. I have witnessed first hand how these vignettes stimulate positive problem-solving.If you work with adolescents and want to find a resource that truly speaks to the teenage experience, this is the book for you."
5,ease and excellence,it was easy to find what i was searching for and payment was quick. when i received my product it was in excellent condition and my gift was really appreciated. thanks
5,CONTRASTING THE ENVIRON,"A Naval Station, with it's hundreds of nuclear warheads, each of them hydrogen bombs, individually capable of vaporizing 20,000,000 people in less then three seconds flat, provided the perfect counter-point for this recording. AND, geuss who was in charge of Naval Station Muzak 75-77? YOURS TRULY! I miss you all! Paris"
4,No remasters !!,"What a great album this is !! Kirwan and McVie put out a mutilayered group of pleasing melodies and Bob Welch shines through the mist with his best song Sentimental Lady,which is the definitive version,not the one on Bob's solo work.This was Danny Kirwan's swan song with the band as he went out with a flourish. His Sunny Side of Heaven dovetails over the ears like running water over stones on a warm summer day. Breathtaking! He also gives us a classic with Dust,so real and simple. Christine shines on Spare Me a Little of Your Love and rocks out on Homeward Bound. My one problem,where is the remastering ??? This was the first ever album I bought by the Mac,way back when.These pre,Buckingham-Nicks albums have been overlooked for too long. Remaster,please !!"
4,Danny's Swan Song,"Bare Trees is the final Fleetwood Mac album to feature the highly talented and vastly underrated Danny Kirwan. His contributions to this album are worth the price of owning it. The title cut, Child of Mine and Dust are some of the best songs he wrote for the band(Dragonfly and Sands of Time are still the best). I've always been amazed at how mature his playing was at his age. The others in the band are hit or miss in my opinion. Bob Welch's Sentimental Lady and The Ghost are good but Christine McVie's material is ho-hum. Her contributions have always seemed overrated for this line up of the band. It's a shame that Kirwans behavior in the group became so bad. The band was in the right to fire him but unfortunately, it hurt them badly musically because as much as I like Bob Welch, he just couldn't carry the band the way Green and Kirwan could."
4,pre-Rumours nugget,"Just heard today that guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Bob Welch passed away this week. Very sad news. I really enjoyed his contributions to the pre-Rumours era of Fleetwood Mac, especially the excellent ""Heroes are Hard to Find"" album and this fine album, ""Bare Trees"". Welch wrote two tracks for ""Bare Trees"": a nice tune called ""The Ghost"" and the most wonderful ""Sentimental Lady."" You might have heard that tune; it was an actual hit! This album also was one of the last Fleetwood Mac LPs to feature guitarist Danny Kirwan, who contribued five songs on here, including the hypnotic instrumental ""Sunny Side of Heaven."" Of course Christine McVie is also present, doing a lovely job as usual on vocals, and contributing two songs of her own. This album may not knock out fans of the Buckingham-Nicks version of Fleetwood Mac, but it was a very well-crafted bunch of pop-rock songs that still resonate today."
5,Great Album,"This is a great CD. Great Bass riffs by McVee, great vocals, and great/amazing guitars. A great 70's band with that 70's vintage rock!"
3,Bare Trees,"I purchased the album when it was originally released. The CD brings back memories. Anyone interested in adding to your Fleetwood Mac collection, this is a ""must have""."
5,My favorite of the Kirwin led Mac,"Bare Trees continues where Future Games started off. A little lighter in feel, Bare Trees showcases Danny Kirwin on his swan song with the band.All songs are great - save for the final spoken track ""Thoughts For A Grey Day"".Things kick off nicely with Kirwin's Child of Mine. His standout track on here is Sunny Side of Heaven.Welch contibutes with the very nice Sentimental Lady (later a big hit for him when he went solo), and Ghost.Christine McVie pens some great tunes here such as Homeward Bound and Spare A Little of Your Love.Bottom Line: Great early Fleetwood Mac album. On the same plane with Future Games but this one is a tad stronger IMO. Sort of like Volume 2 of Future Games."
1,What on Earth is This?,"I'm not sure where they dug these versions up, but they are not the original versions in any case, not even for the Challengers' own material. Look further if you want surf music. These are pretty mild-mannered. Muzak, really.I'm not saying some of these are not potentially interesting in one way or another to somebody. The sax on K-39 (not original) was OK. And I assume some some later edition of the long-lived very commercial Challengers recorded them. But teenagers never exulted to these sounds voluntarily. Even people who used to be teenagers would find them rather dull."
3,Nostalgia meets the boot,"It's the first month of 2003 and all the kids aren't listening to this. But none of the music is bad it's just sorta been done,turned over and been done to a scorch done-been-done. But I bought it because this antique-type surfing music had gotten a five-star rating. What is great about this cd is the terminology of ""the day"" type inside the pamphlet. No joke! I'm giving my copy away, in search of harder,faster surf music i.e.,the background music to boarders, on the new cable show, on foxsports---54321.This other stuff is too nostalgic and makes me gag."
5,"""Colored Glass"" Shimmers. . .","""Colored Glass"" is a stirring novel I couldn't put down. The author of this book appears to possess an innate ability to not only peak interest with every turn of the page, but also invoke a need for the reader to reflect upon their own beliefs regarding what they would do if faced with a moral, ethical and possibly life-changing decision. I highly recommend this book to fans of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" as well as anyone who wishes to not only read, but ""experience"" a well written novel. Although I haven't spent much time in the South, I could almost feel the humidity with every description detailed by the author."
5,Political Comedy,"Richard Pryor is gut wrenching funny on this cd as he was when I used to sneak to hear the albums when I was a kid.In one bit he asks, ""Where are all the white folks?"" He states, ""I haven't seen any white folks around. White folks are into yoga. You can't get no nut doing no yoga... You got to get the $%#@%.""Low birth rates among whites is now called the ""Browning of America.""On another track, Pryor talks of telling jokes in jail to keep ""Bubba"" off his booty. ""If someone trys to #$%&^ me you'll read about it in Jet Magazine's picture of the week. Mr. Pryor please let the %$#&^ go now, we merely want to sew it back on the body."" This stuff is hilarious!There is much more with Mudbone and the voodoo lady. Check this out.However, this cd is not for children on the faint of heart. But, for those who love flat out raw comedy laced with the truth, this cd is a huge hit."
3,Moderately funny,"The album could have been a lotter better without the 11 minute Mudbone skit. But, the personal stuff makes it all worthwhile. R.I.P Legend"
5,Classic,"Along with ""That N*****z Crazy"" this album is a classic. His videos in the late 70's/early 80's were great but these early albums will have your ribs aching and throat hurting from laughing so much. Pryor was not only a comedian but was a great storyteller. He will set the scene for you and then will go into a story full throttle and there is no letting back. It is worth the money even after playing it so many times. I had both of these albums on cassette and they were worn out from playing so much. I have most of them memorized and they are still funny to listen to. I am a fan of Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Eddie Murphy, Katt Williams, Kings of comedy, etc. but there is only one Richard Pryor and he is the true KING."
5,Great Comedy,"Pryor was a classic entertainer and one of the funniest to ever take the stage, a must have recording!"
5,Excellent cookbook! Every house should have one!,"This is one excellent cookbook... every house should have one. The recipes are delicious and easy to make, and best of all... it doesn't cost too much to make a great meal, when there are only a few ingredients. I buy this cookbook for newlyweds and also for housewarming gifts.... always a hit!"
4,Quick & Easy for the new cook,"I have bought 3 of this cookbook, 2 as gifts for my kids when they moved out & one for my husband when he was sent out of state on a long term project for work and had to fend for himself....great book, easy recipes especially for the novice cook. I find myself using this book quite a bit now that it's usually just my hubby & me for dinner. Most dishes are for 2 or 4 people which works out well."
2,"Okay, but not the best...","I used to get Cooking Light magazine, until I decided to get the Cooking Light cook book, which covers each recipe included in the magazine's calendar year. The annual Cooking Light cook books are great.This 5 Ingredient/15 Minute Cookbook I was a little disappointed with. Most of the recipes are stressing fast, rather than healthy or great tasting. Many of the recipes call for pre-made or canned/boxed ingredients. I am not a fan of boxed mashed potatoes, or bread in those rolled up cardboard tubes. There is one chili dish that my wife and I frequently make, but one good recipe doesn't really make a great cookbook.I wish that this book would have had more fresh ingredients, and less prepackaged products."
5,Great Cookbook!,"This cookbook is great for anyone who doesn't have time or doesn't like to cook. It has simple recipes that don't require a lot of chopping, dicing, sauteing, etc.Some of the recipes are pretty high fat acutally. If you are following Weight Watchers, you will find many of the recipes have higher point values (6+)."
2,Only recommended for the cooking impaired,"I bought this book after having subscribed to Cooking Light magazine. The easy, healthy and tasty recipes they offered every month made me think that ""The 5 Ingredient 15 Minute Cookbook"" would be another great resource. How wrong I was! This book has proven to be nothing but a disappointment.The recipes in this book are easy and quick, but they are bland and uninspiring. Most of the ""tips"" for making quick, nutritious meals are really shortcuts that any competent cook could come up with (i.e. using pre-cut stir-fry meat or pre-sliced frozen vegetables). Quite honestly, these recipes *taste* like they only have 5 ingredients and only took 15 minutes to slap together. In other words, the recipes only have five ingredients because they left out the flavorful ones!My advice: DON'T buy this book. Try a subscription to Cooking Light or another of their cookbooks. This one just doesn't measure up."
5,Great for Beginners!,"I've now bought 3 copies of this book. I gave each of my 3 children a copy when they left home & had their first apartments. It provides a good variety of recipes & a shopping list for each. Quick, easy, & nutritious!"
3,5 Ingredient 15 Minute Cookbook,"This cookbook has some good recipes, but I didn't see any that are 5 ingredients or less which is what the title promises. Most also take longer than 15 minutes. It really wasn't what I was hoping for."
5,You will cook more often!!,"This book is great! All of the recipes I have made have been simple, quick to make, and very tasty. I am able to make healthy, high quality meals with little effort. Great for folks with busy schedules!"
4,Great for Mom!,"I've been trying for a while now to get my Mom to eat healthier, but she always complains that my recipies are too complicated. I got her this book for Mother's Day and she absolutely loves it! Everytime I talk to her she tells me about the new meal she cooked. She is excited about cooking and eating healthy, and it is so easy for her to do!"
2,Recipes are a little dated -- lacking in interesting ingredients,"The recipes in the cookbook are definitely from 13 years ago, culinarily speaking. Few variations from ingredients like peppers, onions, tomatoes. Wanted something more trendy -- not more complicated, but more current. Sent it back."
5,"cookbook w/ great pictures, recipes, and shopping lists","I originally balked at the price of this cookbook, but once I opened the pages, I couldn't resist purchasing it. The glossy pictures of the foods inspire you to want to make the meals. I really enjoy the shopping list of groceries needed that is provided in the margin next to each recipe. The foods are varied, taste good, and will definitely help our family eat at home more and out less!"
3,hit and miss,I've had this cookbook for two years now and have found the recipes to be very hit and miss. A few recipes have becom classics (fettucine alfredo with artichokes and mushrooms) and a few have been so bland I would have been better off eating the page the recipe was written on.
2,Still looking for a five-ingredient item,"I'm still trying to figure out how they can call these recipes ""5-Ingredient Recipes."" I haven't found one that has only five ingredients yet. I guess they were just kidding. Also, the recipes call for many things that aren't on my ""OK to eat"" list, so I'm questioning the ""Cooking Light"" promise too. I'll probably keep the book because some of the recipes look pretty good, but over all, I'm disappointed and don't think it delivers what it promised."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I ordered this book because I have often found good things in the pages of the magazine, Cooking Light. This 5-ingredient part was appealing because in addition to cutting down on time, it also, hopefully, would cut down on costs -- fewer ingredients=less money, right? Not so...the heavy reliance on prepackaged foods seemed to make these meals cost more than others. Also, I found some problems, such as a suggested meatloaf cooking time that was impossibly short. I thought that the meal suggestions are pretty uninspired, and have used this book very little."
4,Great book,"This cookbook has fast, healthy recipes. I especially like that it includes prep time and cooking time, that it has beautiful pictures, and that it gives you a shopping list so you don't have to waste time figuring out what you need to purchase at the grocery store."
4,Good for weekday cooking,"I'm surprised at the complaints about the recipes using pre-processed/packaged foods. That's what a 15 minute cookbook is about, and you can always substitute. I use this one quite a bit for cooking during the busy week. Weekends are for the more complicated recipes. Like any cookbook, this has some recipes more bland than I like, but overall I'm quite happy with it."
1,Cooking Light: 5 Ingredient 15 Minute Cookbook,"This book is not worth the price, If you LOVE fish you may like this book but you can only eat fish so many times. I don't recommend it."
1,Not what I was looking for,"This book used too many pre-prepared products for me. That was very disappointing and am returning it to the store I bought it from. I like cooking from scratch as this way I know exactly what is in the recipe. With using pre-prepared items, you never know what is actually in them, nutrition wise."
1,worst cookbook ever bought,"worst cookbook ever bought. Prepackaged food. Fast is the only concern. Not fresh, or healthy. I can't imagine that the food even tastes good. Waste of money."
5,Cooking Light Cookbook,"I have already reviewed this product, but its worth saying again. It was an excellent purchase, I received it much sooner than expected, and I use the book all the time."
5,great cook book,My friend had this book and She loved it. I got it and have already used it!!! great to great quick meals and delicous
5,Love the jar!,I use this jar for my ice tea! I drink a gallon a day! Take the top off or leave it on.. its perfect!
5,Love this jar,"I use this to make sun tea. It's exactly what I was looking for -- just a simple, glass jar. The lid is nice and does not leak."
5,Excellent fermenting jar,"Strong jar made of quality glass and a tight fitting lid. Jar has over a gallon capacity, making it easy to use for those recipes with approximately a gallon of product. No more excessive tamping down. Much better for fermenting and being able to watch your product as it ferments, versus using a crock. Good for storing dried beans all winter. Definitely recommend Bormioli glass jars."
1,No TWAIN drivers!,"What bothered me about this scanner is that I purchased it to scan documents as images. While it brags about being able to scan documents as PDFs, nowhere does it say that you can not scan things as JPEGs. If I would have know ahead of time that scanning to a JPEG was impossible (or atleast prohibitively difficult), I would have never bought the device, instead I paid to ship it back."
3,Jams too much for the price,"Yes it is fast, and immediately converts to pdf. However, it jams quite often which means a restart of the scanned materials. It also doesn't handle differently sized pages in the same stack."
4,Excellent Movie based on a True Story,"This story is heartwarming and will also make you feel angry at times. It deals with a highschool and its football team forced to integrate. If that weren't enough they are forced to accept a black head coach replacing a white coach destined for the highschool hall of fame. The situations that would arise in such a setting are very REALISTICALLY portrayed. The film is believable. You'll cheer for certain characters, dislike others and be saddened by a few. You will enjoy the plot and want to add this to your library."
5,love this movie!,i love this movie! there are a lot of lessons and many other things people can take away from this movie
5,"A moving story, solid acting & a film well worth your while!","Set in 1971, Denzel Washington plays Coach Herman Boone who finds himself out of place when he takes on coaching a high school team filled with whites & then later on, joined by blacks. this becomes a problem as the whites are still treating blacks like [..] & causes lots of tension and fights between the team. Boone's job with the help of former head coach, Bill Yoast(Will Patton), is to help maintain the team's anger issues and let them to get to know each other before they make judgements. this is a very powerful and motivating story! based on a true story, the film not only does this film earn credit for having a realistic story, no cheesy subplots, this film makes you really care for the characters and we get to see a real strong film!"
5,Inspirational film,"A reminder to us all we are all the same inside no matter our color, working together for the same goal. love it."
5,Classic Movie,One of the best football movies ever. Denzel Washington NEVER disappoints. A great movie that I watch every few months and will never get tired of watching.
3,movie gift,"I purchased this movie as a gift, that has not been given yet. The movie came in quickly and without damage, but it hasn't been opened yet."
5,(;D),"The movie was a hit. It was a great example of leadership and team spirit. The society that the players grew up in was filled with hate and discrimination torwards black americans. The intergregation of schools stirred up more conflict amonst the players. By the team getting along and winning, the community supported them and in a sense put their differences aside for the team. That's what I liked about the movie. That's what made it a good movie."
5,Pleased,It came very quickly and in good condition. My daughter loved this movie but we only had it in VHS.
4,Good Movie Here,"""Remember the Titans"" is a good movie. The football scenes are the best parts. It also deals with the mixing of blacks and whites. I think it's hard to recreate the way it really is, but they do a pretty good job here.Generally overlooked, however, is the treatment of the players by the coach. He (the Denzel Washington character) is pretty cruel to them. The movie condemns racism, but condones this type of treatment. I just feel that it is really wrong (and harmful) to treat boys this way.But this is a good movie...not one for repeated viewing...but good for those of us who always hope for the best."
5,Yet another movie that Denzel should've received the oscar,"Hands down...the best movie of the year. It paints an accurate picture of the complexities of life. It has moments of pure triumph and glory...as well as moments of absolute sadness. This film was saturated with scenes that made the viewer sit back and reflect on the importance of integrity...how very fragile life really is...and how very passionate friendship can be. The most touching moment in the movie was when `Bertier's', (Ryan Hurst) the white co-captain, ex-girlfriend `Emma' (Kate Bosworth) goes to the sideline and introduces herself and shakes the hand of `Big Ju' (Wood Harris), the black co-captain."
2,High School football the Disney Way,"This is an ok movie. It portrays high school footbal in the ""60's"" down in the south. Thier are flaws everywhere: football is graphic and hard hitting escpally when theres hate from everybody and I know that no one on a football team would sing and dance all over the field and also there wouldn't be a little girl helping coach 16-18 year olds. But Denzal Washington gave a great performace as coach Boone to make this movie watcable but I still hate all dinsey movies that have sports in them."
3,overrated,"It's not just another team movie, it's a DISNEY team movie!Seriously, I thought this was severely overrated. The acting's good, the story's good, the editing needs work (too many feet of football scenes - watch a real game, for pete's sake) - but nothing about it is great. Washington's a fine actor, but this is far from his best effort. He was better in his first film, 'Carbon Copy'. The story? If you can't see nearly every plot element coming, you're not paying attention. Your kids might watch it more than once, but if you have alternatives, you will get bored."
3,Remember the Titans,This movie has one of the best actors. The classic story. Everything about this movie is great. Good movie for public preview.
4,Great Sports Drama,"This may not be Denzel Washington's best movie, but he certainly proves that he is an exceptional actor. But what really makes this film is the performances of the lessor known actors and their ability to bring the viewer into a troubling time in America's history. This isn't the best sports drama of all time, but it's up there. I would highly recommend it to anyone, but if you are a football fan it's a definite one for your list."
2,Forget the Titans,"This is a typical American ""feel good"" movie that can't seem to be able to rise above the obvious cloying conclusion toward which it slowly meanders."
1,False advertisement,"I had never bought from this company before, but I was promised the dvd was in great condition and played without errors. I couldnt get through the first 15 minutes without it skipping, or the picture fading. I even cleaned it with a disc cleaner and it still doesn't work. But, beacuse I opened it, I cant return it, so now i'm stuck with a useless dvd."
3,Not as Good........,"The teachers at my school showed REMEMBER THE TITANS to the fifth grade. I don't think this is appropriate for 11-year-olds. There were some parts that I really hated, like when one football player is in a severe car crash and is paralyzed from the waist down. There was also a gay football player on the team and mild cuss words. I know this movie is trying to teach a lesson, but it was very disappointing to me."
1,Doesn't Work,"My daughter was very excited to get this movie for christmas, cause it is her favorite movie, and it doesn't work"
5,Great movie!,"""Remember the Titans"" is definetely one of the most uplifting movies I have ever seen. Starring Denzel Washington and Will Patton along with a terrific young ensemble cast, this is a story of friendship and hope, of respect and courage. I really wasn't sure whether I would like this movie since it is all about football, a sport I don't particularly like or understand, but I was pleasantly surprised! The film is based on the true story of the Titans, a Southern high school football team in 1971. There, in the midst of racial conflicts and prejudices, two coaches - one black, one white - must take a mixed group of football players and turn them into a team. Which, as they come to understand, takes more than just training on the field - they must first learn to respect each other, before they expect to win any game. This movie will have you laughing and crying, and, ultimately, rooting for the Titans!!!"
5,Titans and Berry College,"Remember the Titans is a movie everyone should see. It is one movie that had the potential to appeal to everyone. I have seen it numerous times because it is so good, but also because parts of it were filmed at my college and high schools in my area. The part where the team is at football camp was filmed at Berry College in Rome, GA. Some of the Football games were filmed at high schools in the Metro Atlanta Area. I love to watch this movie because I have actually seen and stood where the movie was filmed."
5,Denzel's Best Yet,A riveting movie. Denzel was Oscar worthy in this film. This film encompasses overcoming adversity and racial differences in life. This is a must see movie. It is also one of the greatest sports movies of all time as well.
4,Its An OK Film,"'Remember The Titans' is a good movie. But the use of racial injustice in this film seemed rushed, and discomforting to watch. The movie just doesn't truly heed well in leading up to how this event led to increased equality among the characters of the story. This movie sort of seems somewhat like another movie, 'Varsity Blues.' Although they have almost nothing in common, they both emphasize the will to win and the importance of winning in football. But unlike 'Varsity Blues', this movie installs a message about racial hatred. Overall, I found that the parts where the African-American and white players had rollercoaster situations where they fought at times, and then celebrated a moment later made the movie flow like the movie was rushed. Thus I can only give it 4 out of 5."
5,I dont even know how to play football!!!!!!!!!!,"I have no clue how to play football and probably never will even though it has been explained to me a million times. It doesn't matter. This is a great, great feel good movie. I loved it. Its a great ""family movie"" but if you have a wild 5 year old running around like my crazy niece they probably wont sit still through it. Anyway, great movie! Its about mixed races coming together to win and becoming like brothers. If you liked Rudy you probably will like this even more."
5,remember the titans,"i have not seen this movie, but my daughter likes it very much ... it is a gift for her so i know i will have the opportunity to review it soon."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,great movie and disney was very smart to do this movie it is a movie the whole family can watch!!
4,Remember The Titans,"I just saw this really good movie called Remember The Titans. People that like football will probably like it. I am going to give you just a little bit of information about it.Its a really good movie about football that showed how African American's were treated back then.When it came down to football they were forced to like eachother and get along.They finally come to realize they are the same, the only difference is the color of there skin.Finally in the end,well i wont tell you how it ends,but I am sure you will like this movie.This is why I think you all sould see this movie."
1,Don't Double Dip Disney's Deceptive DC DVD!!!,"A lot of D's which is the grade I'd give this Director's Cut dvd. Cut all right. They cut the 2 commentaries, the trailer, instead of 6 deleted scenes there are 4 & 2 of them are in the director's cut so are totally unnecessary. On the box it says new bonus features. There are NONE. It say's French language track. NONE. Usually a second release is an improvement but in this case it is so much poorer as not to be believed. Disney should pull this & at least properly advertise what is on it & what isn't. The movie is an A+. The Director's Cut DVD release rates a solid F. I wish I hadn't sold off my original when it was first announced & preordered this P.O.S. Don't say I didn't warn you."
4,A CLASSIC FOOTBALL MOVIE,"this movie is not only very compelling but also has good morals involving racism ,alcohol, and it rele shows how people of different backgrounds can come together when circumstances get rough. this movie is probally for ages 10 -and up because its a lil slow if you are too young to understand the concept of racism and football if you like good drama movies or football movies watch this movie its a legend itself as the titans were in the movie. a small town highschool breaks the color barrior having both whites and blacks on one team some players accept it and others dont and there black coach (denzel washington who plays an excellant part ) gets threats but still coaches his team to victory REMEMBER TO WATCH THIS MOVIE"
5,We need more family movies.,"I thought this was a great movie. It was a movie that my kids could watch with me. However, the one thing racism)they are trying to conquer in the movie, still lives on today. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was a great movie."
5,You will remember the titans...,"No matter whether you're a fan of sports or not, Remember the Titans is an incredibly inspiring film.Based on a true story, it is set in 1971 at TC Williams High School, a school that is about to intergrate white and balck students for the first time.The school's football team meet pre-season, and the separate white and balck groups must learn to get along under the guidance of Coach Herman Boon (Denzel Washington).What follows is a remarkably touching and powerful story, that mixes tragedy and success.Great acting by all involved, especially the black members of the cast, who are funny and add something else to an already 5-star film.For movie fans of all genres, Remember the Titans is a great movie that will inspire you and having you watch it again and again. This is the greatest sports film ever made, and it is sure to have watching intently from beginning to end."
5,Remember the Titans,I was searching every store so that I could watch this movie for a school project but I want having any luck. Then I remembered the Amazon movie service. I ordered the movie and was able to view the high quality movie via my Playstation 3 without any problem. Thanks Amazon
5,Excellent movie,It's hard to find inspiring movies for kids without immodest images and language. Despite some of the fighting scenes we all enjoyed watching as a family.
5,Best Movie,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I had this movie and when I moved, it got lost so I bought it again. I watch it with my kids a few times a year."
5,One of my very favorite movies!!,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I am a major fan of Denzel Washington, I love Philidelphia and The Hurricane, so of course I had to see it!! My english teacher showed it to us in class, and since then I've bought the soundtrack and the video. I'm also a major fan of Ryan Gosling (Alan Bosley) he's totally HOTT!! An' a really good actor!! Everybody should see Remember the Titans!!"
1,Remember The Titans,The movie did not play and I had to throw it away and will reorder it. I have seenthe movie previously and enjoyed it so that is the reason I purchased it.
1,Hollywood Hype,"When they say this movie was ""based on a true story"", they should say, ""In typical Hollywood fashion, this movie was very loosely based on a true story."" To say liberities were taken is an understatement. For the true story go here:[...]Had they just made a fictional movie without resorting to Hollywood hype, I may have given it 2 stars."
1,Highly overrated,"Surprise - another ""Denzel against the world"" film. In the last several years, this fortysomething actor has been in films where he has played either a cop, a military man or the victim of some horrible racial injustice. In each of these films, Denzel's straight-laced character has to fight an uphill battle against a seemingly insurmountable force. It's getting pretty tired.""Remember the Titans"" follows the same paint-by-numbers formula as the rest of his films. It just seems too easy, too feel-good, too lush. There's a theme park feel to it, as if the powers-that-be had decided to open a Rosa Parks trolley ride at Disneyland."
1,Worst sports movie of all time,"As a previous reviewer had stated, this is not about football. It's about an embarassingly preachy movie that distorts cultural differences, and tries to be cute.This could have been a great and moving film. Great/true story, Denzel Washington, good message. Too bad they had to try to get cute and funny, and then try to integrate modern leftist cultural issues into a film where the year is 1971 and these issues were not prevelant.If you want to see a great movie about African American triumph, see Glory. If you want to see a great football movie see Rudy. If you want to have your intelligence insulted see this horror."
5,exciting movie!,My daughter watched this DVD at school and asked me to purchase her a copy for home. She really enjoyed this movie and has watched it several times since then.
3,Remember the Titans,"The movie is great for the whole family. No violence, sex or bad language but a great movie based upon a true story."
3,Plain but has an important message.,"Remember the Titans starring Denzel Washington I believe is a Disney film so expect a sappy ending but this movie is worth watching. The story deals with racial harmony, I like the message but you feel the producers wanted this film to be as sugary sweet as possible. Washington always gives a solid performance, he's reason enough to give this football film a viewing, enjoy!"
5,great for all ages,This movie not only showed how blacks and whites could come together in a time of need but it showed how you should not judge someone on their color. This movie was one was the most incredible movies i have seen. It shows two backgrounds coming together and making peace within their self and the community. At first it shows the hatred toward the blacks then it shows how generation have chagned the thoughts of young ones. Once some thought change the learning process begins. This movie is perfect for any football fan as well as anyone who loves to enjoy a good movie.
5,"Great movie, but DON'T BUY IT USED,","This is a great movie and one everyone should be required to see because of its uplifting, positive message. However, I've bought THREE different copies of this movie from Amazon's used dvd's section, and EACH ONE has stopped working at the same spot on the dvd. I don't know if there is something wrong with it or what, but if you're going to purchase this dvd, do yourself a favor and buy it new. If I would have done that, I would be $20 richer right now, and would have a viewable copy of this dvd."
4,"Not a Titan, but Close","If you have ever seen a sports movie, then you know before the opening credits how this movie must end. The best thing about this movie -- a good, solid film -- is the role reversal of Washington. He plays the hard-nosed coach, who, despite his color, pushes his racially mixed team in a town where the races don't mix. Very well done. 4.25 stars"
5,Gwendolyn's Opinion,This movie is so good. I really love it.In this movie it talked about a racism country. In this country their was a school that had to be torn down and the black kids that went to this school had to move to another school that had only whites. This was the only school that had a mixture of whites and blacks. They had to learn how to get alone with each others. They had the best football team. They were very good. They were also undefeated. The movie was mainly about football team. How Denzel Washington was so hard on the team. This is what made the team so good. The more the team won the games the more the parents started to get alone with each other. One of the boys on the team got in a car accident and he was paralized from the waist down. He didn't get to play in the championship game so the team won specificatly for him. The team won the championship game and the boy that got in the car accident died like five or ten years later.
5,Remember the Titans,"Remember the Titans is one movie my family has watched together at least 10 times. We know the entire movie screen by screen. My boys are 15 and 8, the oldest playes football and we use the soundtrack for pregame tailgating on Friday nights. The movie shows how good life can be when you look past the color of a person's skin to their heart and soul. I recommend anyone with children (girls too) to watch this movie. We own two copies each of the movie and the soundtrack"
3,A Very Good Movie,"This is a great football movie. It shows the intensity of the game and the challenges that this team (The Titans) had to overcome. Denzel Washington plays the newly hired coach to the Titans, an all white football team. The main theme of this movie is the interacial going ons and the belief that people from different societies can get along and become friends. Other than that, we get to watch great football scenes where the hits just keep on coming. I for one think this is one of Denzel's best roles. If you're in the mood for a good drama and love football, then try this one out, you just might like it."
2,Silly and predictable,"This movie is so silly and corny, it made me uncomfortable just sitting through it. It is very manipulative in that all the whites in the movie had to become more ""black"" in order for the team to work well together. That's not how it was in the 1960-70's!! It is probably a good movie to show your young children, but beyond that it is pretty useless. Denzel Washington is very predictable as the rough and tough yell alot coach who eventually perseveres. If you want a good football movie that isn't trying to be preachy, just watch Varsity Blues or Rudy."
2,Dissappointing to say the least.,The reason why i bought this was because of the great reviews it received on this site but i have to say this film is completly overrated. Its just so corny. There were times i watched this film and shivered at the tackness of the script. The Charachters were just so wooden besides Denzel Washington who gives a great performance as usual. THe one thing i liked about this movie was the excellent music. This really helped to drag the movie along. I was so dissapointed though and id advise you to not fall into the same trap as i did.
1,No.,"America's Race Problem, as observed by the Walt Disney Company. Denzel Washington plays a man who's just become head coach of a freshly desegregated high school football team. His tasks are to win a championship and to make the whites and blacks like each other. This is all easily accomplished, thanks in large part to the Temptations, which, once again in a Hollywood film, prove to be the ""common demoninator"" in the race-relations struggle (after all, who doesn't like ""My Girl""?). However . . . judging from the football action, one may doubt the veracity of this so-called ""true"" story. ..."
1,Forget the Titans,"I knew this movie was in trouble right from the opening scenes. Ham-handed direction, stereotypical characters, trite dialog and predictable storyline. Honestly, I was thinking to myself, ""Jeez, all it needs is for 'Spirit in the Sky' to start playing"". Sure enough...I kept on watching, though, hoping it would get better.It didn't."
1,Poor Quality CD,"I received my CD's and when I played them they were full of skips I was so PO'D I tossed the discs in the trash and went to a music store and purchased new ones. I wrote yours off as sunken cost. I am a good customer but I will not buy Poor Quality merchandise,and this is not the 1st time I have received items in poor condition,but it is the Last."
1,IMPOSTERS,"Though America may draw you in with instantly accessable pop/folk don't be fooled, this is just a sad imitation of Neil Young. When America was ripping him off Neil was making some of the best rock music ever, try American Stars N' Bars or On The Beach for much better and more original music from NEIL HIMSELF and not imposters."
5,America,I am a huge fan of America and have a vinyl album but just wanted the CD to listen to in the car
4,America Lives On,"I recently attended an America concert, they perform 130 concerts a year throughout the world. The quality of the performance and versatility of the band was impressive. The audience included the young and old. Yes, some of their music is a too sweet for some, but the raw and basic songs of the early years are classic and timeless. When I met Dewey Bunnell I told him that ' A Horse with No Name' has immortalized their band, not too mention many other great songs like 'Tin Man', Ventura Highway', etc. Turn on the radio for awhile and then listen to America, that may help you appreciate these song masters."
4,Whew....,"I don't know how but somehow I missed out on this album when I was a kid. I guess I was put off by the Top 40 overplay by the AM radio back in the day....I'm just now coming back to re-discover America and I really understand why this album was so popular. I do believe they become overly saccharin on this album buy hey, that's America. This is a really, really good album that is well worth owning and certain to be listened to over and over again."
5,A Gallant Debut,"'The Devil To Pay' truly is a sailing mystery adventure, in which a beautiful boat (yacht) takes the lead role for a good portion of the story. I found the characters appealing because they rose to an enormous challenge with courage and intelligence. Leda, the heroine, particularly impressed me. The plot is tight, with a fitting surprise ending. Boat lovers will especially appreciate the detailed descriptions of everything pertaining to the boat and sailing, but even I, a total ignoramus of sea-faring matters, appreciated the deft way in which the author made use of his extensive knowledge of boating to develop and further the plot.Well done, Mr. Parola!"
5,"A dark, murderous mystery novel","The Devil To Pay: A Sailing Adventure Mystery by Gene J. Parola is a dark, murderous mystery novel where a yacht delivery crew is called on a seemingly ordinary job to pick up a client's boat in the Bahamas. Their routine turns deadly as they get mixed up in a shadowy intrigue, and a trapped woman on the boat may or may not be the what she appears to be. An absorbing tale of hidden motivations that keeps the reader guessing until the end, The Devil To Pay is enthusiastically recommended for those mystery buffs who appreciate a well crafted tale of intrigue and suspense."
3,My Son Loves It but.....,I really wanted to get my son a cool necklace and came across this one. For $10 I thought Awesome! til I saw the $6 shipping charge!!!! But he'd already seen it & worked hard on his chores so I got it. The necklace is nice and seems sturdy. He has said anything about pinching his neck yet but it still doesn't justify the shipping charge in my mind.
5,Detroit not only has Motown to claim as it's own,"The spring and summer of 1972 brought my 8-track to life as I played the daylights out of this masterpiece. Of course the 8 track is long gone but when I play the CD now it brings back great memories of those times. The topper was the ""Killer"" concert that I went to and was it ever a party!! 5 stars for Alice's best work."
4,Alice's Scary Album,"Alice Cooper has the reputation on being a scary rock star. Well this album proves it. He along with his band created scary songs such as ""Dead Babies"", and ""Killer"". He also made great hard rock songs such as ""Under My Wheels"", ""and ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah"". The album in general is a mix of scary, evil and hard rock rock sounds that make this album great. Buy the album if you like Alice Cooper."
4,Their Best,"Cooper isn't always easy to stomach for the average early '70s rock fan. They have moments of brilliance interspersed with gawdoffel tripe. ""Killer"" maximizes the brilliance that was consistently subdued for some reason. This is the only album of their's I've kept... If you're inclined to try out an Alice Cooper album for the first time, buy this one."
5,Vinyl Is Final,I got the LP record when it came out and I'm still playing it loud. Get out of the house and buy a PHONOGRAPH!
3,Desperately In Need Of Remastering!,"This is my favorite Alice Cooper CD. But as with ""Love It To Death"", the sound quality is less than desirable. When is Warner Bros. going to remaster this classic, as well as ""Love It To Death"" and ""Muscle Of Love""?"
3,Soundtrack for the stage show,"Killer is not as compelling an album as Love It To Death. Alice is writing songs for the stage show. Under My Wheels and Be My Love are great garage rock songs, but You Drive Me Nervous and Yeah Yeah Yeah are throwaways. Dead Babies and Killer are song and instrumental montages written solely as backdrops to the stage show Alice was performing at the time, so they become a little tiresome on record. Not as much as a step forward as Love It To Death, and not up to the par of School's Out or Billion Dollar Babies, but a good hard rock album nonetheless."
4,Shame on Warner Brothers......,"First off, all of the original Alice Cooper band albums are more than worthwhile. Get them all....on vinyl that is.These low priced CD's that Warner Brothers is peddeling are the original transfers from back when the CD was first introduced. Terrible hiss and poor sound quality make these unlistenable in my opinion. I have MP3's and cassettes of these albums that sound much better than these factory WB CD releases do.I also own all of them on vinyl and can firmly attest that the AC Band catalouge is in DIRE need of a remaster. Save your bucks until that happens or listen on vinyl/cassette until then. Don't encourage these guys. Shame on you Warner Brothers for continuing to sell such outdated/poor quality transfers here in the new millenium!!"
5,there's a reason why there is no lower rating than three stars for this one!,"This is simply a rock classic from a classic band at their peak, I am surprised to see any alice fan give this one less than five stars though. But the lowest here is a three star! and that says it all, this is a true classic rocker that lays down solid shock rock like 'halo of flies' and 'dead babies' and then slams forward with great songs that were at least big fm radio hits 'under my wheels' and 'be my lover' two 'hits' imo by any standard. That's quite good for a band that was like a horror movie made into music! That's what alice cooper the band was and this wasn't just alice , he had a talented band of stalwarts all the way. One has sadly passed away since then but the great tunes live on and any metal or hard rock fan should add this one to their classic metal mix."
5,I'm A Killer And I'm A Clown,"This album is absolutely fantastic. Most of Alice's albums are (except for some of the later crap). This album has some of the best music in the world, although only half of the population of thirteen year olds would barely know who he is, let alone like him. BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't regret it."
1,Switchs on player not durable (MTBF about 1-2 years),"I owned one of these units and it work quite well for about 16 months. Then the unit stopped working- as it was out of warranty and I could not get it repaired, I disassembled it (I am an Electrical Engineer). The system stopped working because the on/off switch fell off it's pc board- it was not glued or otherwise anchored in way to the card! The switch components are plastic and even moderate usage will produce fatigue that renders the unit useless in 1-2 years."
2,A bad choice at any price,"Confusing, flimsy controls.Depending on the size of the CD's, it may not even be able to handle two CDs worth of music. Three full-sized CDs are out of the question.I have needed to uninstall and reinstall the PC software twice.I don't use MP3 players much. In fact, I have spent more time trying to get it to work than I have spent using it. I am on the verge of throwing it away as more trouble than it is worth for me.Sound is reasonably good though."
2,"Quality Fails, Customer Service Never Exists","I bought this product one month ago and it used to be good. HOWEVER, the problem happpend exactly one month after the purchase. The FM tuner, for some unkown reason, didn't work suddenly. No radio, no signal but just noise. (The other part seemed fine.)I tried to contact iRiver Customer Service Dept for a warranty service. No email replied ever to my internet request. Their 800 customer service line seemed busy forever. I once held the line for over twenty minutes and nobody answered. They must have lots of customers to take care of and I was just so unlucky.Overall speaking, I strongly deny of the recommendation of this product, not only for its quality control problem but also their lousy customer service."
4,Nice,"This mp3 player doesnt hold too many songs..........but it definitly is great quality.mine was accidently put in the washing machine and dryer--it came out with no problemsthe radio and voice record work very well and if you dont mind not having a lot of songs, this mp3 player is definitly right for you"
2,Okay at first.....,"I got this MP3 at a Black Friday sale and I was absolutly thrilled with it...until the end broke off. The end where the battery was broke off one day and wouldn't stay on. I now have to hold it in place with rubber bands. Now, the player will constantly shut off whenever it moves the slightest bit. The radio, however(before it broke)was great, the organization of the files was good and the mic worked okay if you talked straight into it. Overall, this was okay for the money I paid for it, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,"Outstanding value, perfect for the gym","This is an excellent little flash player, perfect for sessions at the gym or on the trails. Sound quality is very good, useful features are numerous, and the size is not too small, not too large, but about right. Yes, it does feel a bit fragile, but used with the neck strap or, even better, with an armband holder or belt clip, it holds up just fine. For the price, this older model is a great value for beginners or those who want an inexpensive, almost expendable source of a couple hours of music or radio."
1,Cannot,The problem with your record or recordings is that they can not be brought up on Media play and I have the latest installed.No listen no buy.
3,"Some native, some bar music","Been to Tahiti & listened to dozens of Tahitian CDs. The drumming is great. Some of the recording seems to have all but lost the left channel. Tracks 16-17 are a jazz band, I guess one would call them? -- reminds me of 1950's Hawaiian jug band music. There's also some flute. A nice variety, but not universally the very best performances nor recording."
1,jar received is not the jar described,"I received these jars today, they are nice solid jars with good lids but they are square not round as in the description. I have returned them twice due to this. I need this size of jar and it will work for me so I guess this time I will keep them as I am out of time and am tired of trying to get the jar I want. If you order these know that they are good jars, just not what is described."
5,Great Active Games,"This is a treasure trove for anyone who leads children's groups: scout leaders, camp counselors, Sunday school teacher, etc. The games are timeless, and many require no equipment. Children love the games, and enjoy the connection they feel with the children of another time and place."
5,Be In The Know About N. Carolina Beaches,"Don't look here for hotel or restaurant info. This is a beach book, so check in here by county to see the well-known beaches and those that will surprise you. The author selected Hammocks Beach State Park as the best of the lesser known beaches. He suggests the best beaches for first time visitors, the best for sports oriented vacations, and the best for visiting in the off-season.The information is detailed, giving the things you need to know for your vacation. Want a boat ramp, or to see a lighthouse? This books tells you where to go. (The Associated Press reviewed this book favorably.)"
5,Homemade Candy,Book arrived as advertised: paper cover a little worn; book in perfect condition. I am very pleased with this purchase and will buy from this seller again and again and again.
4,Value and quality,"Two years hence and its still going strong - good balance, light and excellent for slicing. I had to sharpen it twice with a stone but otherwise the occassional sharpening with a Wusthof manual insert and drag sharpener kept it in good shape. Very happy and dont miss my Sabatier (left with a friend) dont use my Henkels chef knife (which came in a set) much and also stopped pining after more expensive knives (hattori etc.)."
1,poor,The knife is substandard it has been ground wrong and in one spot you can see right though the groove in the blade
2,It made my eyes cross.,"This book was such a dense and fairly unappealing read. It was a required text for a course and it was my least favorite book during that semester. The book is not concise in its definitions and tends to ramble. I have read a 16-page article that summarizes this concept quite nicely (and without a lot of muddled tangents and excessive explanations), so you can imagine that I found the 400+ pages a tremendous overkill. At the conclusion of each chapter, I always felt as though a third to a half of the entire chapter could have been distilled to a few main points to cut away much of the chaff. If you are interested in the cognitive-integrative approach, do yourself a favor and try to track down some short articles from a journal. You'll learn all you need to from those pared-down writings and will save yourself eyestrain and a headache. If you wish to use this as your practice methodology, my sincerest apologies to your clients."
3,"Really dense, lacks examples","This is my required textbook for a cognitive theory class in grad school. It's really dense, but the worst part is that it rambles on but hardly gives any examples of key concepts. I like that Berlin is advocating for an integrative approach rather than straight cognitive, but it's a hard read."

5,Great Memories,The selections on this CD are outstanding! These are favorites that we all grew up hearing our parents singing. Love it!
5,very good product,"Men's Altama 10"" Black Combat Vulcanized Boots...excellent product and very good quality, comfortable and lightweight.I also like their form, fit, and come in all sizes, I say it again are excellent for forced labor."
5,Early Neil Young,"One of his very best. I am re-starting my vinyl collection and this particular album was one that was on the top of my list as was Jackson Browne's ""Saturate Before Using""."
4,Vandals of the Void -- Going Where No Man Has Gone Before,One of the first space science fiction novels I ever read way back in 1969 in 8th grade. It ushered a love for space science fiction into my life. I still regard the book as one of the best. Love to see it placed on Middle School reading lists today. Should be made into a movie.
5,"Electric horns, quarter-tones, and creative time signatures","Join Don Ellis on electrophonic trumpet and his '60s progressive big band. Rock to Indian Lady in 5/4. ""Space out"" as Ellis duets with himself on Open Beauty. You won't hear another snake-charmer like Turkish Bath, with its electrified winds tuned a quarter tone apart."
2,Not useful for practitioners,"This tape contains a very slow pace elementary illustration of Chi Sau for most of the tape and towards the end of the tape a quick run down of the Chum Kiu form without much explanation. I am one of those that don't believe you can learn martial arts by just watching tapes. And for those of us that learn it from a sifu, this tape does not offer anything extra or inspirational. I would recommend the series done by Augustine Fong instead which runs through the forms as well as giving you demos of what you can do after mastering all the techniques. Besides, I found the cadre-dressed robot-like students that do the demonstrations a big turn-off."
1,get more information on yahoo finance page for free,In preparing a report on Telco's I purchased this article. Was completely useless. Do not recommend this article.
5,I can't bring myself to put it on the shelf,"Milosz came highly recommended: by Anna Akhmatova, Irina Ratushinskaya and Joseph Brodsky! (I even think that I read that Pasternak was a fan late in life!)The cover blurb says that he contains the twentieth century within himself like no other poet, and this certainly is true. But this is not primarily ""historical"" poetry. It covers deep issues, but remains intensely honest, open, personal, experiential and biblically spiritual. Having said all of that, I don't do Milosz's poetry justice. It is not there for anybody's encyclopedic curiosity of ""honest Christian experience"". It is a scalpel that cuts open his own heart, and mine. Repeatedly. Clearly. Without descending into the self-consciously avant-garde. He opens me in more ways than I sometimes think I want to be opened."
4,The everlasting past.,"Guilt rides with Milosz, from beginning to end. No measure of success can expiate his self-perceived sin. His literary prowess cannot dispell it. A great, but burdened writer."
1,Phony,"I tried it and had no way of knowing if it worked. Then it featured in Consumer Reports magazine recently. They said it does not work, period."
1,Terrible,"They don't stick to phones. The ""adhesive"" is either not there or very poor. A waste of money. I don't recommend this item at all."
1,Erm...,"... if it really absorbs 99 percent of the radiation from the phone -- how the heck could you make calls from it?... does all the absorbed radiation stay in this plasticy-looking device, forever? or does it re-radiate it later?"
3,Who's the typesetter or proofreader?,"The book is beautifully written, but it was hard to read. The Kindle display wandered all over the screen with broken lines and broken words. Paragraphing was totally missing (even admitting that the English method does not indent a new paragraph but does leave an empty line above.) Punctuation also left something to desire. In short, the book should be read on paper and not subjected to some electronic whim with no one casting an editor's eye upon it."
2,Not the Worst Historical Novel I've Ever Read,"If you are an uncritical Churchill worshipper, the book is great fun.If stick figures, one dimensional emotions, shallow plotting, a touch of anti-Semitism, and a kind of clunky plotting of history don't excite you, then the book may not be your favorite."
1,Black & Decker F63D The Classic Metal Iron,The iron doesn't heat as hot as it should. Could have been damaged in shipping due to inadequate packaging from the seller ANTOnline. ANTOnline put a shipping label on the original container. The original container only had a cardboard insert for the base of the iron.
1,Do not purchase this item,"I purchased this iron due to its low price and the fact that it was a Black and Decker. I was dissatisfied with it after only one use -- it did not get hot enough, it did not glide smoothly over the clothes, and the 'resting plate' got extremely hot, which concerned me from a safety perspective. The iron does look attractive, but that hardly matters. Even though this particular model is not good, the 'Digital Advantage' model has received very good ratings and I plan to go this afternoon to purchase it. This model not withstanding, Black and Decker still makes the best irons."
1,No stars for this vendor,"It has been two months and I do not have a refund. Ace Hardware sent the wrong product, I returned it immediately, using their labels that were e-mailed to me, and they did not credit my account."
4,Heavier weight = fast ironing,"This iron has a nice solid weight which makes for faster ironing. I agree that not being able to see how much water is inside is a drawback, but with even steam, great looks, and a nice pricem it doesn't bother me. Far far better than any plastic iron I've used.My mom has had one for a year, loves it, and I've just gotten one for myself."
3,Good Iron But Avoid if You Have Hard Water,"I love this iron because it is heavy and it gets really, really hot. It takes out every wrinkle. The handle is comfortable to hold. After using it for a couple of years, the plate started pitting and I believe it is because I have hard water. The little holes have clogged up. It then started to ""snag"" delicate fabrics and I ruined some brand new curtains I was ironing. I tried running some vinegar through it, but I think the damage has been done...it's too late. If I had used distilled water from the beginning, that probably wouldn't have happened. If you have hard water, use distilled and you should be all set. My only complaint is the plate is aluminum instead of non-stick surface. If they put Teflon on this baby, it would be great."
4,Great for the basics,"I have had several of these irons. I like them because they are heavy and don't automatically turn off. This iron is really nice for basic ironing; however, I have decided they don't work real well when quilting. Sometimes, when pressing small pieces, the fabric gets caught in a steam hole and gets scrunched up, then you have to iron like mad to get it flat again--which may cause distorting of the fabric. All in all, I would get this iron--it used to be made by GE ages ago--it is a workhorse."
5,A good old fashioned iron,I've had a few irons in the past 30 years - all plastic etc. Good brands. But this classic metal iron is the bast yet.I hope Black & Decker continues making it.
1,Not a good buy,"I bought this iron about three weeks ago and was VERY disappointed with it. It didn't heat properly and the sole plate was awful, it wasn't smooth but was brunished which made it want to grab and hold the fabric. It's heavier that other irons which should have made wrinkle removal easier, didn't happen. I took it back and exchanged it for anothe Black and Decker iron which I will review on another page. J. Pelfrey"
1,I want my old iron back,"I bought this iron and gave my old one away. I thought it would work like an old fashioned heavy iron. It does not get hot enough for most of my needs. The steam feature is more of a stream, or droplet feature than steam. I was very disappointed.I do like that it has a safety and turns off after a certain amount of time."
1,A bit disappointing,"I have had the Black & Decker classic metal iron (F63D) for 20 years. When I accidentally bumped my ironing board and knocked the iron on my tile floor, the iron never quite recovered. It sputters and the thumb rest on the handle becomes uncomfortably hot. In search of an exact replacement, I went to Amazon. Aubuchon Hardware in MA said they had the F63D, but in fact they sent me the F67E. Their packing slip said F63D, but it's not the same iron. Beware of the model you are searching for. The F63D is the best iron & I am frustrated to have to search like Sherlock Holmes to find an exact replacement!"
3,Made outside USA;do not think it will last,"Would be much better if maker was known before order.Thought being Black and Decker, it would be a very fine product fromthe USA, it is made in another country and the metal is not Stainless.I am sorry to have purchased it before know where it was made. The ad made methink it would have been made in the USA. We wonder where the Jobs are?YEs. it works ok for now."
5,It is one heavy iron.,"I gave up my more modern iron for this heavier model because the newer models are much lighter in weight. It is more difficult to remove wrinkles with a light weight iron because effective ironing requires heat, pressure, and sometimes water. Well, without the weight of the iron all the pressure must come from your muscles. I noticed a difference right away on cotton and linen clothes.I don't use the water tanks on my iron, instead I use a spray bottle to wet the clothing as I am ironing it. This works just as well as the water tanks in irons, and your iron will last much longer. It is easier to fill up a spray bottle than to fill up your iron."
2,Not For Uniforms,"This Iron is a Poorly Operating Sample (P.O.S.)! It has two controls; Temperature & Yes/No for Steam. If I was going to put only two controls on an item, I would make sure both worked. Black & Decker thought that was too much effort. Does it get hot? More or less. Does it make steam? No. Nein. Nicht. Bu how. Nadda. Zero. It does make an Excellent door stop."
3,Where are Gamma's first two albums(cds)?,"Like Rhaldy from York, Pa. I have been searching, in vain, for Gamma 2 for almost 20 years? If anybody knows where I can find it please email me. Come on Amazon. I give this one a three, not because it is lacking, it's just not their best work. Anyone that says so hasn't heard Gamma2"
3,Classic late 70's hard rock,Will someone please tell me when they will reissue the first 2 Gamma albums? I have the vinyl and they contain some really great songs and guitar work. I give this compilation only 3 stars because it contains songs off of Gamma 3 which was a really weak sort of techno album.
5,One of the best pieces of music I've ever heard,I think Ronnie Montrose and Gamma were way ahead of their time. I wish that they would put out their other albums on CD's. I think the public is being cheated by them not putting them out.
5,I love Gamma!,"Gamma never reached the same commercial success that Ronnie Montrose's other band, Montrose, did. Still, I love this band!Maybe it's because they were never considered a progressive rock band or a hard rock band. Actually, I really liked their version or hard-edged rock and roll with heavy guitars but a strong dose of synthesizers.Besides, Davey Pattison, the vocalist for Gamma, was a great, great, hard rock vocalist. He has since moved onto blues, but he and Ronnie Montrose have left a legacy of unique, sophisticated progressive rock in the form of Gamma.I just wish that all three Gamma records were available on CD!Gamma fans: there is an english import called 'Gamma-Concert Classics'. This disc has live versions of many of the cuts off Gamma1!"
5,Great 80's Rock from an unheralded band,"This ""best of"" collection from Gamma's three albums truly rocks! Why this band, for the most part, wallowed in obscurity is beyond me. The components are there for superstardom (great guitarist, solid vocalist, and good mix of synths). Perhaps Ronnie Montross, one of the top rock guitarists of all-time, is always ahead of his time. Anyhow, if you want to hear some mesmerizing rock n' roll, purchase this CD. While some tracks may require repeated listening to realize it, everything on here is good. Favorites are: Wish I Was, Razor King, Voyager, and the epic Fight To The Finish. It is a shame that the original albums are not (yet) available on CD, as there are some other Gamma gems out there that (currently) are only on vinyl."
1,Lessen learned,"Did not work on my drier, put in the garbage were I figured it belonged. At least it didn't cost much."
1,"Waste of time, money and scarce resources",One word: Pathetic.Deeply flawed is ALL departments.Shipping (flawed): Hose came with an irreversible fold (not coiled as common sense would dictate)Materials (flawed): Hose unable to maintain integrity and kept collapsing at the slightest hint of suction.Suction (flawed): Zero suction.I SHOULD have heeded the other reviews (shame on me).One positive though ... the box it was shipped in proved most useful for another purposes.
1,dont waste your money,don't bother purchasing this item. the hose is bent in two positions for shipping so when it arrives it is useless. the crease does not come out. furthermore the adapter that is suppose to attach to your vacuum hose does not fit a standard hose.
2,A little disappointed,"When I ordered this product, it came up as a suggestion while looking at Dyson accesories. I actually ordered an extension hose for my Dyson at the same time. My disappointment came when I tried to attach the dryer vent cleaner to my Dyson hose and it did not fit in any way, shape or form."
1,Junk !,I read all of the reviews on this product before I bought it. I should have listened. It took 5 minutes to see that this is a real waste of time. It does not work. The tube collapsed as soon as I turned on the vacuum.
3,Bad shipping procedure,It is a big mistake to ship this in a bent position because the plastic tube gets crimped and the lint tends to get stuck at that bottle neck point. It should ship straight or in two pieces (the clear tube part) or some other way to keep the flexible plastic tube straight i.e. crimp free.
1,Vacuum too strong?,"Even after the reworking of this item's design, it still collapses as soon as the vacuum is powered on. Absolutely nothing could enter the tube when it was ""sucked"" closed and flat. Maybe if your vacuum is lacking power from the start, it might work. I used with a Hoover Wind tunnel upright and it was a total loss. According to many reviews, the tube used to be shipped folded with kinks. The new longer packaging allows for the tube to ship without any folding. So this was not the cause of the tube collapsing flat."
1,I wish I would have read reviews before purchase,"This fails so badly it's almost comical. It truly does not work at all. Look at the picture and imagine the clear tube going into dryer is flat, from vacuum suction, from the end you can't see to her thumb, and it really is."
2,Don't buy,"Attached to my vacuum, turned it on and the hose collapsed on itself. Obviously you can't clean your dryer vent when the hose it flat."
1,Dryer vent vacuum cleaner attachment,"It was a waste. I'm glad I didn't pay much for it. When it is attached to the vacuum and the vacuum is turned on, the plastic nozzle gets sucked in and nothing can be drawn through the devise. A real disappointment."
2,Disappointed,This item wasn't as easy to use as it looked on TV. It didn't fit my vacuum hose. It didn't go very far into the dryer and it had a difficult time pulling out lint.
1,Worst product ever,This product is a complete scam. When you turn the vacuum on it sucks the hose shut so it cant pick up any lint and it will burn up your motor. Do not buy this product!!!!! Horrible!
1,Not Good,"I tried to use this product on different vacuums with the same result. The flexible plastic tube collapses and will not allow the lint to pass through, no matter how low I set the suction."
1,TERRIBLE-DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The vacuum hose which is made of a plyable plastic sucks shut, thus losing all suction. Does not work at all! I HAD to rate ONE star because ZERO is not an option. Waste of money."
3,dryer vac,"The end on it was stuck together as soon as I turn on the vacuum but once I cut the fringed ends off the device, I could not believe the mess of junk that came out of the dryer. About a dollar in change and a bunch of lint. For the price it is a good purchase."
1,Horrible! No Stars,"The plastic comes collapsed. Squeezing it open to try to vacuum impossible. If you actually get some lint it jams up.I'm an idiot, junk."
2,Buyer Beware,Requires constant cleaning.Tube is too thin walled and it keeps collapsing on itself.Sprung for a lint lizard.That works great!
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,"Amazon needs to add a ""ZERO"" star option for this product. This item does not work at all. You attach it to the end of your vacuum and stick it in the dryer - then when you turn the vacuum on the cheap plastic extension sucks shut and all suction stops completely. What a total waste of money!!!!"
1,Not happy,Wouldn't make the curve in my dryer. Once I got it where I wanted it to go it would plug up.
1,Dryer Vent Vacuum Cleaner Attachment,Don't waste your money on this (as I did). The item didn't fit on my vacuum cleaner. I had to hold it on by hand.Could have accomplished the same thing myself without wasting my money on this.
5,Great sucker,This vacuum snake does a great job of keeping the interior of the exhaust of our clothes dryer clean. Exactly as advertised. Every home with a clothes dryer should have one.
1,GOOD CONCEPT BUT DOESN'T WORK,"Due to the length of the hose, it has to be folded up for shipping and arrives with kinks in it. The kinked areas close up and cut off the suction from the vacuum so the lint cannot be sucked up through the hose. The lint just got stuck in the end of the hose and wouldn't go up the hose into the vacuum."
3,Buyer Beware,"This is a great idea. However, the end of the vac that fits into the vacuum attachment may not fit your vacuum. It does not fit my vacuum attachments. The other end of the vac is very narrow. It has little slits in the plastic (creating 'fringe') but works better if they are cut off. The vac is really good for getting lint not only in the lint trap but also in the narrow areas in or around the dryer."
1,Very dissappointed in this product - wasted my $$.,"First of all - the way the plastic tubing was packed in the box, it put several kinks in the tube that could not be straightened out. I connected the tubing to my vacuum but it would not create enough suction to suck any lint. I had to try to hold the tube in the vacuum, then also try to hold the 3 places where the hose was kinked. Even with two sets of hands the badly designed product didn't work. Good idea, bad design?I cannot even return the product since it would cost me more than what I paid for it , thus wasting twice as much $$."
1,Useless Attachment,"For some reason I ordered two of these items. The seller was prompt in delivery of these items and was also prompt in providing a full refund. Why the refund? Well, unfortunately, when this product arrived, both of the flimsy plastic tubing were permanently ""folded"" in two places. Thus, when the vacuum cleaner is turned on, the tubing simply collapsed in on itself at the folds rendering the attachments completely useless."
1,Not as good as others,This product has a plastic tube that is constructed of thin plastic. When used the tube constricts and closes off the suction. My mother has another similar product which is of better material and works great. I would not recommend this product.
1,DON'T BUY THIS !!!,Just like everyone else says. Plastic hose is too thin and colapses on itself and closes up rendering it useless. I ending up purchased a Lint Lizard at Bed Bath and Beyond and it's much thicker and better quality for $10.00. Very dissapointed!
1,JUNK,This is JUNK do not order it. The hose completely collapsed and I tried it on 3 different vacuum cleaners thinking my vacuum cleaner was too strong. Nope it's Complete JUNK!...
2,Not What I Expected,"I was disappointed that the hose isn't more flexible, it is a harder plastic tubing and doesn't reach down into the dryer vent like I thought it would. It only cleans as far down as my long handled duster will clean, and I already did that monthly, so I feel I wasted my money on this product."
1,do not buy,i purchased this product and it doesnt work hose colapses do not waste your money very cheap hose so dont i repeat dont buy this
1,"all hype, don't work","idea good, choice of materials terrible.tygon tubing collapses as soon as it starts to suck up fuzz, rendering it clogged."
2,Dryer trap cleaner,"Don't waste your money on this attachment. The tube is too flimsy and as soon as the vacuum is turned on, the tube collapses and there is no suction.I ended up having to cut the tube just to make it work at all."
1,Really Bad,It does simply the opposite of advertised.The clear pipe is a cheap plastic material that de closes up and the vacuum is on.I could buy a piece of clear plastic pipe for a U$ 1.00 and do it myself a better version.
2,rabbit,this would have been a great item if it had come rolled up in the packege insted of folded an kinked in 2 places . once this tubing is kinked it doesent come out. I ordered something differentkennyg
1,really terrible product,i would have returned it if i realized how awful it would be once i used it. it's basically useless because its such cheap plastic and it is folded when shipped and never regains it's shape. nothing like the picture looks. made cleaning the vent a really stressful experience. buy a lint lizard.
1,dryer vent cleaner,I definitely would not recommend this to anyone. It simply doesn't work. It collapses when you turn on the vacuum and you can't remove any lint. I would return it but it would cost me more on postage than I paid for it. Definitely not as advertised. I would have rated it a zero if I had had that option
2,Not as expected,"The description of this item showed it also with the vacuum brush for vacuuming keyboards, etc. However, when it arrived there was only a piece of plastic hose attached to a vacuum attachment. Not the way it is advertised on TV nor according to the viewable ad when this was purchased."
3,extended vac hose,"The item itself, is a great idea. However, it does not fit tightly on every vacuum hose. The way it is packed for shipping creases the hose, creating kinks, and build up. It was a bit of a pain to use the first few times. And if you dont mind duct taping it to an existing vacuum hose, it's OK. It should be a tad larger, and shipped without being kinked. It doesn't really do much more than a shopvac can do. I DO like the smaller size for the dryer vent. It's the only item small enough to fit into the vent, and reach the bottom. But I found myself fighting to keep it un kinked so the suction would do the job. I would not be to quick to recomend this item."
1,Dryer Vent Vacuum cleaner attachment,"Cheap in price, but if free not worth the S/H cost. A piece of plastic tubing which closes on itself under vacuum, letting no suction of dryer lint to come thru."
4,"Dryer Vent Cleaner, Vacuum Attachment",This is very handy and really gets down into the filter vent to grab the accumulated lint. Efficiency seems to improve with each use.
2,Did not fit my vacume,This did not fit my vacume so i do not think it was a good tool. The plastic tube was flat and did not suck in the lint all was stuck at the end of the tube.. Not a good tool for everyone.
3,Dryer vent vacuum cleaner,I am sorry to say it does not reach totally my expectations. It works but you have to fight with it as the end of the hose closes up constantly. While flexiable it is too flexiable.
1,THANKS,AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO BUY THIS ITEM. THANKS FOR ALL THE REVIEWS THEY DO HELP. ANY IDEAS HOW TO MAKE THIS YOURSELF.
1,Jams to much,"Jams way to much, strip on top of strip when it gets stuck and it's about 1 dollar a strip so it turns out to be a big cash gobbler. The readings done always show either you get alot of ""ER2"" like the Itest which can take 7 strips before giving you 1 glucose reading! Accu-Check Nano is better and easier to read."
4,academic but real history,"First of all, contrary to the review now on line, this book was not written by John T. Williams, whoever he is, but by John T. Alexander. This biography is a much more serious and learned biography than Henri Troyat's, which I read in 1987. This book has dull parts, but the story it tells is an incredible one. Catherine had an amazing career, and of course her parade of favorites is legendary. I found this book to be good academic history and it well deserves reading."
3,Waxing and Waning,"As some of the other reviewers have opined, this book is somewhat of a difficult read. It waxes and wanes at holding the reader's interest. Some sections of the book are truly exciting while others become tedious from excessive lists of names and mundane details.On the other hand, if you are a student of Russian history, there will be a significant gap in your knowledge if you don't struggle through it."
1,Catherine the Great: Rent the Movie,"I have read history books more interesting than this book. When i purchased the book i thought that it would be an interesting work. The book started off interesting. Then, as it progressed it got worse. Rent the movie. It would be much better. Trust me."
2,Predictable... was not able to finish this book,I tried to like this book but one of the main characters (Elena) was so annoying I simply could not deal with it. What a waste of time. I was unable to bring myself to finish it. I'm finding that overly argumentative & difficult heroines make for a boring & predictable story.
1,Did not work for us but we were not usung it right,We bought this to suck the oil out of our car at the dipstick-- the drain plug is glued in place. It seems the the car isdesigned to disallow passage of anything not shaped like adipstick into the crankcase.We sent it back.Might work on its designed purpose but not for 90's Acura Autos
4,A Comforting Collection,"This is a collection of poems and excerpts meant to comfort and inspire those going through difficult times. It doesn't quite have the cohesion of Helen Haye's 'A Gathering of Hope', but it is wonderful in its own right, including quotes and poems from nearly every notable author you can imagine and a few not so well known. It is fairly Christian, though only a few of the verses actually refer to Jesus. a number of them are non-religious as well. There's even a 'Navajo Song' listed.The book is divided up into the following sections: 1. Faith 2.Kindness 3. Serenity 4. Consolation 5. Joy of Life 6. Hope"
1,A Reprint Under Another Name,"This is nothing more than a reprint of ""Signal Catastrophe"" under another name, not a new or different book as I had thought."
2,Not good for long-term use,"After a year of having this, the filling seemed to 'split' in the middle, leaving it with an area of non-support."
3,"Thin, smells nice, leaves a prominent film","I received a sample of this, and am surprised to see other reviewers saying that this isn't greasy. It's not *oily* or waxy the way something like cocoa butter or Eucerin would be, but it definitely leaves filmy fingerprints on everything for a while after you use it. It does smell more like lemongrass than lemon, and after the film works its way off, it's really a very nice moisturizer and softener. It's just not something I'd use while I'm on the computer since it leaves shiny prints behind on my keyboard."
4,A little bit strong,"This is an excellent product, providing you enjoy a strong liquor hit! Other than that, I'd rate this product 5-star"
5,VERY GOOD,"Not you're average chocolate covered cherries. First is this dark chocolate not too rich, just the right mix of sweet and bitter that melts on your tongue as you bite down. Then there's the impact of the Kirsch (cherry liquor). And finally, the chocolate, cherry and Kirsch all mix into this wonderful burst of flavor. Something special!Mon Cheri Liquor Filled Chocolate Covered Cherries 30 countJack's favorite since his tour in Germany in 2004. Delivery was early and was well wrapped for 96 degree heat here in Florida."
5,I love these,"I used to get these from family in France every Christmas. This year I was told they would not be sending them so I looked on line and sure enough, Amazon had a supplier. Thanks."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought the software for a handheld Magellan GPS that I recently purchased. I did not realize the software comes on a DVD format. I did not have a DVD drive on my computer. When I tried to return it, the company I bought it from, ""ANTONLINE"" would not allow me to return it despite the fact that I had just purchased it and I did not install it. I ended up installing a DVD drive in my Computer. The software does work as promised but it is very tedious to install and the directions are not that self explainatory. When I complained to Amazon, they did not respond to my complaint....very disappointing performance from Amazon. If I were you I would not buy from ANTONLINE. I would buy the software elsewhere."
3,Mapsend Software,"The mapsend software loaded great and I as able to download selected regions to the GPS unit but when we used it during a recent trip to Seattle we finally put it away and went back to maps as it created very strange routes that took us way out of the way. This was the first time we used it so there might have been ""user"" issues as well. I would make sure you are very comfortable with the process before I relied heavily on it."
3,A hard and sharp brush,"It hurt my face when I first used it.=( It is a very LARGE and sharp brush, but works well!My hair feel good with it."
2,Not great for my hair,"These brushes are good quality but do not work well with my fine hair, they seem to grab. May work fine for other hair types."
4,Nice brush,The brush is exactly the size and shape that I wanted. The only thing I would have preferred is if the bristles were natural boar bristles or other type which is supposedly better for your hair. But it works great.
3,Awkward size,"I've owned several Cricket brushes and love them for many years. This time I decided to go with the 1 1/2 inch version (my rational was that it is slightly less expensive but it will do the same thing, right?) I was wrong. I definitely don't like this one as much as my larger brushes. I just can't get my hair to straighten the same way. But if you know this is the perfect size for you (maybe for bangs or layers?) this will definitely work!"
3,"Cricket Technique Thermal Brush 1 1/2""","It is great for blowing dry my hair but I was hoping it would be a little bit smaller around. Do they make a 1"" one?"
5,Love this brush!,I discovered this brush at my hair salon and fell in love with it. I have curly hair and blow it straight. This brush does an amazing job.
1,Caught hair... OUCH,"I had high hope for the brush but as soon as I tried it, it caught my hair and pulled it out!!! OUCH!!! I have medium length hair and it would get caught in the handle. I returned the item."
2,Doesn't grab my hair.,"I have fine/curly hair, so I need a brush that will really grab my hair as I blow dry it. This just doesn't do that. My hair ends up curly and frizzy with this brush."
4,A very enjoyable read...,"Robert Heinlein had one conspicuous flaw in his fiction: any character could, at any time, use the interjection ""So?"" as a complete sentence retort, and the tone conveyed was always that of Heinlein's own Show-Me State disdain for accepted truth. In Y2K: The Millennium Bug, Don L. Tiggre exhibits a similar shortcoming: any character can, at any time, speak or think in exclamation points, and the tone conveyed is usually that of Tiggre's own unbridled optimism coupled with his disbelief at the pervasiveness of conventional wisdom.But I have read many times over every word Heinlein wrote, and while Tiggre isn't his equal-- NO ONE is-- he has produced an exceptionally fine read, one worthy of any big-name storyteller. It is important to bear in mind that while the possible (and completely unknowable) outcome of the Y2K problem makes a fascinating backdrop for the novel, it is the story itself which is paramount.And a swell story it is, indeed."
3,AipTek is more value for money,"I use the Aiptek HyperVcam Mobile and Creative EX Pro. The price is about 30% difference with Aiptek the cheaper one.Creative is better at still pictures. However, the software that comes with it will show you a different picture during preview from the one it actually captures. e.g. The preview is darker but the actual saved picture looks okay.Aiptek captures a poorer still picture but it is WYSIWYG and it has auto-focus.The video for these 2 cameras looks the same to me. But for the difference in price, I rate Aiptek as value for money."
1,wish i could watch it,when ordeing did not see it was vcr need i say more it must be good it about football so if you have a vcr then go for it
3,Genial But Lightweight Celtic Comedy,"This story of the yearly match between two rival pub owners and their patrons which is to be played for the last time with winner taking all(i.e., the other pub) is not a new concept, certainly, but in this rendition it comes off as a pleasant, well acted , not-all-that-funny comedy. Most of the actors have been put to better use elsewhere (Richard Grant, Tom Sizemore)but they all do a respectable job in this. The biggest problem is that the movie is strung on a pretty thin premise and seems to go on a bit too long before the predictable denoument. I found myself comparing it unfavorably with ""Waking Ned Divine"", which had something of the same feel about it but was lots more interesting and lots funnier."
5,You gotta love it,Sure this case may be 1/2 as much as you would spend on a computer itself but if you have even thought about getting this or seriously considered it sitting in your house than you know where your money is going. This case is very well built and very sturdy. Some of the designs may have you scratching your head but once your past that this thing is a dream. Options for expandability are limitless (literally). The only problem i have found is the ability to come up with the rest of the money to upgrade my unit. Take it from me a person that loves computers and to build them you will not be dissapointed!
2,Bland,"This anime series in my opinion is below average for an anime series. The plot is predictable and the ending left much to be desired, being rather made in haste, only if you understand the game series you would had understand a bit more. Graphics are average for that period of time and most reviews of this were posted when the golden age of anime began when everything anime were cool at the period before people's anime tastes improved. Thus this anime series fell below the radar of mainsteam anime audience."
2,Forget this show,"The main character is Elk and he is part of a group of adventurers. The animation is a decidedly a cute young style and it's pretty good looking, but the monsters are gruesome and terrible, so parents should be warned.There is some action in the first two episodes on the airship, but not the third. The dialog was lousy, and I didn't care about the characters. The plot was really dumb and slow. The story doesn't grab you in and the music is bad. The intro doesn't really give you a right impression of what the show is really about. Lieza is a stereotypical helpless female, who has some special powers to talk to animals. The characters are clich茅d and there's really no DVD special features. Overall I was dissatisfied.I wouldn't recommend Arc the Lad to anyone. A similar show that is done much better is Escaflowne."
1,Horrible,"Length:: 0:31 MinsThese laces are awful, they came so stiff that when you bend them they snap."
1,Not waterproof as Advertized,"I bought these because they said they were waterproof which is important if you want to keep cushions dry. The day I received them, put them on the chairs. First problem, only 2 of 4 covers had velcro attachments. Second, it lightly rained overnight and in the morning I checked, and each chair pad was wet. I do not recommend this product at all."
1,Terrible - let water right through,"I purchased two of these covers early in the summer for new patio chairs with cushions. They fit perfectly and are easy to secure to the chair in case of winds that might blow the covers off. However, in contrast to a sofa-sized cover that I had purchased previously, these covers just let water come right through. I take them off and the chairs are wet, while the sofa (with the other cover, which I purchased more than four years ago) is dry as anything. I would NOT buy these again unless for furniture that is not exposed to the elements. Terrible. If all you want is protection from the sun, then sure, buy these."
5,Brandy Moss-Scott: Starting With Me,"Track Listing:1. Starting With Me [3:51]2. Brother Louie [4:57]Taken from the album ""FRESH"""
4,wonderful organ and band music,Good dance music with rich organ and band sounds. So many familiar songs in medley form.
5,Another View,"While reading this book, I took a tough emotional ride. I was sent to one of these schools at the age of 16. In fact, I was at the same school as ""Katie"" during the same time she was there...Anyway, this book may not be the most professionally put together expose on these schools, but since no one else has bothered to stand up against them, this book shines. Every parent who is considering sending their child to a school like this should a) read this book and various other information online; b) realize that your child WILL be brainwashed (or converted - your choice of terms); and c) visit the school and stay awhile. Don't just dump off your child to whatever convinent program offers to re-program for you..."
5,"I'm not a reviewer, just an old Deep Purple fan!","I've had this album since I was about 16 years old, and I finally bought this CD. This is a great CD! I especially like No No No!, Anyone's Daughter, and No One Came. If you're a Deep Purple fan and you're looking for some great classic hard rock, this is not to be missed. Deep Purple really mixes up there songs on this one, sort of an experiment, I guess. Great vocals by Gillan, great guitar riffs by Blackmore, and great organ and piano by Jon Lord. I think that's what really set Deep Purple apart back in the late 60's and 70's. If you're new to Deep Purple, and you already have Made in Japan and Machine Head, you should get this one next!Mike-""The Old Rocker""Eagan, MN"
5,Classic Deep Purple,"Fools pass laughing still....Outstanding effort from the MK II Lineup. Functions as the creamy filling for the In Rock and Machine head oreo. This album finds the band at the peak of its powers. Vocals from Ian Gillian are awesome. Ritchie Blackmore plays some deliciously hot licks. Roger Glover and Ian Paice drive the machine, and John Lord adds texture and depth to every cut with deft keyborad work. Fireball, Strange Kind of woman, and Fools are my favorite cuts. how can you argue with lyrics like ""Her name was Nancy, Her face was nothing Fancy, She left a trail of happiness and misery.""....I recently saw Deep Purple and was amazed. This led me to rediscover many of the albums all the way through Tommy Bolins tenure with the band. I was also amazed to discover how influential the band and its many members still are today..."
3,Why such a short handle?,"I would have given this 5 stars, but the handle length to pull it is kind of short. I've had suitcases with longer pull handles! They could have made it telescopic or a fold and lock or something. Given I'm 6'3"" this may not be a problem for many of you, but if you are 5'10 and over I would try searching for something in person that you can try out. I dragged this all over the city (the reason I wanted something stackable and on wheels) but the way I had to lean a bit to the right or left ended up hurting my back a bit - not a great way to begin a new project. However, it works great for everything else. Simple quick rolling a few yards is not bad, and the many compartments are great. However, I wish they had thought to make the bottom section with it's own lid like the top bin. That way when you take it all apart you could more easily bring one bin into one area and leave the other in another area. All in all though it works well enough."
4,Great Toolbox,"I am rarely impressed, but this toolbox really impressed me. The lower compartment is spacious and can store my drill, jigsaw plus an electric screwdriver. All the small comparments are roof tight so there is no need to worry for any 'spill-over' of screws or small parts. The handle has a spring lock which is a nice touch."
2,Light duty...cheap hinges,"I Thought this rolling tool box would be useful..it turned out to be a headache...I only moved it 2x and in a week the top was off the hinge. I did not overload it with super heavy tools. just assorted drill bits & such. This box may work out great for a scrapbooker, crafty type use."
3,"Well written reviews, but limited movies.","With this being my first movie review book, I was rather dissapointed the 2000 edition only contains written reviews from the last 2.5 years or so. I found the reviews in this book to be written exceptionally well (to no surprize really). But I am always on the prowl for that one great movie that slipped by me and has since faded into the sunset umong the thousands of other movies not on the ""new release"" shelves. So, if you don't mind the somewhat limited format of this book, it's worth buying."
3,The scent of flowers fills the air.,"This CD is a companion piece to an earlierSeeds CD, which featured their first two albums. This one features the ""best"" songs that were not on their first two albums, other than ""Pushin' Too Hard"", which was. My personal favorite song is the haunting ""The Wind Blows Your Hair"". Some other good ones include ""Satisfy You"", ""Flower Lady and Her Assistant"", ""A Thousand Shadows"", ""Nobody Spoil My Fun"" and ""900 Million People Daily"" (available here for the first time in the uncut ten minute version). Some of the other songs are rather mediocre, though. The Seeds actually recorded a blues album, which was a mistake, as they didn't really have an affinity for that type of material (thankfully only one song from that album is included here). Not every song is a winner, but there aren't any complete failures here, either. Fans of the '60s garage band or psychedelic scenes should enjoy it."
5,Great Album By The Seeds!,"I really like this particular album by 'The Seeds'. I think all the selection of songs are really good examples of their material, some of the songs are more rare than others. If your into 'The Seeds' or just want to check them out, to see what their sound is like, I highly recommend this album. I realize 'The Seeds' have been accused of sounding redundant in much of their song material, but I happen to like their simple style, so if there was just one of their album's to check out, I would say this one."
4,Comfortable and washable,These are comfortable and washable however I don't know how long they are going to last. I have washed them several times and so far there is a small crack on the rubber sole. I am afraid that they are going to continue to deteriorate with use.
2,Higher than MSRP,"At the $19.95 price that Amazon charged me for these slippers, they overcharged by $1.95, i.e. the slippers arrived with a label that stated the MSRP at $18.00. It's not a big deal, but I'll have to be more careful with future orders from Amazon."
1,More problems than just incorrect sizing,"I wish I had listened to the people who said the sizing was incorrect. They also left the plastic tag staplers(?) in the ball of foot area and those were difficult to remove. To the trash can with these slippers! I have bought Dearfoams for many years, but now back to Isotoner."
4,very comfy slippers!,These slippers are pretty and so comfortable. They are best for very chilly nights as they can make your feet feel a bit warm.
3,Good but,"The psycology or approach of the ""Lessons"" is excellent but the programmer was sloppy. The S/W introduces you to the Kana characters pronouncing each and has the option to draw for you each character. Where there might be similarities the S/W shows both Kana for your comparison. The S/W then tests your knowledge of the Kana, writen and verbal.My low rating is against the programming. I had to install it a second time. The first time The S/W called a different font than the Kana fonts. it did not have the Kana font up on ""Typed"" pages but a roman font which did not make sense in either language. Also, On some pages, primarily intoductions or side bars, a few characters or highlights are out of place."
5,Sugoi! Awesome!,Konnichiwa! Mainichi Nihongo renshu to benkyo shimasu. Watashi no tomotachi wa nihonjin desu.Hello! I practice and study Japanese everyday. My friend is Japanese. I've been studying Japanese and I love it. I really love this software because I'm teaching myself how to read it. It takes a lot of practice and time to study.Sayonara! Gamatte kudasai! Bye! Good luck!
1,Sony Ericsson HPM-75 Stereo Headset,I bought this headset to replace my Blackberry Pearl headset in the hope of getting more durability and better sound. Unfortunately what they don't tell you is that the 3.5 mm plug that's advertised is only for the headphones ! It plugs into the mic which has a standard (non-compatible) jack for the Sony phone. Very disappointing that the description didn't make this clear. Of course there were no photos or images of the phone jack in the product description.
5,"Solid, Durable","I bought over 20 of these in various sizes, replacing the plastic in my pantry. I love that the jars are squared, not round, so they line up beautifully in the pantry. The seal is airtight and the glass is thick, it feels hefty in your hands. I love that this product is not made in China, that it is glass, and that it is so sturdy that I bet my daughters will inherit these when I am gone. I am going to buy more of these as time goes on to replace more of the plastic in the pantry until I have zero plastic left."
5,Chambers Brothers at Their Best,"Orignially a two ablum set, half studio and half live. The live portion was recorded live at the Filmore in 1968. LOVE, PEACE & HAPPINESS is a classic. There are no bad tracks on this album. If you like a fusion of funk and soul this is a Must for the collection."
2,Great classic album. Sound quality problems.,"Just had this CD out playing it and thought I would give prospective buyers of what seems to now be be a collectible, a heads up on the audio quality. The audio is distorted and clipping on this CD, LP&H way over compressed, limited or just overdriven clipping distortion don't know for sure what the main cause, plus it's mostly out of phase! Weird. My old vinyl LP copy on Columbia Records sounds far better. Glad I got one when they were reasonably priced. CD is good to have to play all originally 4 sides of this double LP but it's not for critical listening."
2,Do not buy.,"Pros:1. Small2. Came with 420w Power Supply and 120mm rear fan3. Shows CPU and HDD TemperaturesCons:1. 2 out of 4 of these cases that I bought had a malfunctioning POWER BUTTON2. Said it was new, but in fact had scratches all over the inside of the case and the cover was dirty(in fact, one looked like it had coke spilled all over it)3. You have to wrestle with the case lid to remove it and put it back on(poor design)"
3,If you want a more structured answer to your questions,This book of personal NDE experiences and the effect on the author's life is like many others and while they may give you some solace and comfort they don't answer many questions. The best books that I've found that give you a structured view of what your existence is like when you are not occupying a human body will be found in the works of Michael Newton - Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls.
3,Not The Best Book Out There,"I was so looking forward to reading this book but have to admit it was a little disappointing, and some of it was a little hard to swallow. I have to agree with another reviewer--an angel on the back of a motorcylce was a little difficult to believe. I found Betty Eadie's book much more interesting."
3,"VERY thin on substance, but still a good overview","I read this book for a Political Science class. It gives you a good OVERVIEW of the state, but does not go into sufficient detail. It is indeed not only thin on content, but the author also has a clear political bias. However, even with all these factors considered, if all you need is a general idea of how the California State Government is run, then this book will do it for you.If you are looking for lots of detail, then move on."
2,Not Much Here,"I have read some of Huber's other books and they provided quality coverage of the material and were well-presented. However, this text is light on the material. If the font were not so large, and the book so filled with photos and blank spaces, I think there would be about 50 pages of actual information here. The material covered is a loose collection of facts, without any analysis. The main positive is that the information that is covered gives a good overview of the California government. Unfortunately, the picture lacks depth. On balance, I would have preferred another text."
4,canning Jar,"Canning jars are well made, came in mail pretty fast I think there a 5 star but because price is a little high I rated 4."
5,Bormioli jars wow,I use these jars to raise sourdough starter and they are wonderful.. I have more than enough of several sizes.. I also use the clear and colored glass bottles for oils and the like
4,A very elegant canning jar,"Bought this particular jar to store our ground coffee in. It is a really beautiful shape - taller and leaner than most canning jars that hold this volume of stuff. My only minor quibble (and hence 4 stars not 5) is that the jar opening is narrow enough that a male adult probably could not get his hand down into it - ie to grab the coffee scoop at the bottom of the jar if the coffee is almost gone. Other than that, highly recommended and very very pretty."
2,Low Rating for Ridiculous Price-$7.50 at New Seasons Market,"OMG! I wish I would have noticed these at New Seasons Market first, but, nothing came up on Google so I purchased them here. Just returned them because I bought them today at New Seasons in Hillsboro, Oregon for $7.50 each. 2 for LESS than the price of 1 . . . . . . Maybe I should start selling them on here too because I could actually buy them from New Seasons and ship them out, make a couple of bucks and they'd still be cheaper than the price offered here. LOL . . . . . (of course I'd buy them wholesale before I sold them, hmm?)"
4,Quick delivery and good customer service,"I ordered 8 jars, which were promptly delivered. Once of them broken in transit. I called customer service, spoke with a real person, and they sent a replacement right away. The jars are exactly as pictured. I would order from them again."
5,Very Nice Looking Durable Jar,I would buy many of these if I could! The jar is awesome. I used it to bake a gift and fill up the jar as a present. I painted the jar with glass paint and the paint is still on the jar. I would recommend this to anyone looking for jars for their kitchen.
5,the riff,"I've been a fan of these guys for years and have learned whether it be a live show or recorded material, they never dissapoint. From start to finish Moving Units is a nonstop reminder that you can still be excited about new music. Few bands display such passion, energy, and song writting ability while still remaining heavier than a cement mixer. Blending southern groove, melodic death metal, and energetic hardcore into a savory mix that goes down smooth, but leaves you with some broken limbs and blackened eyes."
3,Nice BUT,"This is a nice necklace no doubt, but the hemp cord is really short. I'm a petite woman (under 5ft) and the necklace did not fit over my head."
3,Hard going but worth it,"This is a great companion book to Aristotle's work on animals, a very large and overlooked portion of his writings. Pellegrin shows how many ideas about the classification of animals are erroneously attributed to Aristotle but most importantly, he raises a lot of questions about Aristotle's conception of categories. This has far-ranging implications not only for the study of ancient philosophy but also for the study of logic, the mind, the cognitive sciences in general. Readers interested in George Lakoff's or Steven Pinker's work on cognition will find much food for thought here, as well as much to contest either writer's views. This is a scholarly book in the French academic tradition, not much brio, takes a lot of stamina to get through it. On the other hand, the lack of seductive stylistics leaves you a lot freer to form your own opinion. An important book."
4,ADHD Smart Solutions Video Review,"This was very informative. It gives a different perspective on how parents can seek an alternative route in helping their children with ADHD. I showed this video as part of a presentation for a drug/alcohol class. The presentation was to show how there are alternatives to helping children rather than having them take prescription drugs.The audience that viewed this video with me liked the material that was presented. The film discusses three different families and that helps keep you interested. At times it seemed a little boring, but it gets the point across."
2,The CD-ROM is awful! (But the book's okay--sorta),"I'm usually a fan of Clem's work, but the CD-ROM enclosed with the book is awful. It's a must to avoid. The book is pretty okay (as these things come and go)"
2,Too bad...,"I have to agree with N. Rizzo, the vocals of Michael Jahnz on this record are just not good enough. And I can't immagine why other reviewers are so laudable about this singer. His voice sounds just too thin. I don't know why people would think that his voice is better than Kevin Cronin's, Jahntz sounds more like that guy from M枚tley Cr眉e. Also the compositions on this album are not as good as Richrath's work for Reo Speedwagon. I have been a long time fan of Reo Speedwagon, but this CD falls short in a big way. For me vocals can kill an album, and this one is stone cold..."
1,SOPHMORE EFFORT FROM A VETERAN ROCKER,"AFTER READING THE REVIEWS ON THIS DISC I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING I NEEDED IN MY COLLECTION. WHAT A MISTAKE, I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED IN A DISC. HAVING BEEN A BIG FAN OF GARY AND REO FROM THE HUMBLE BEGINNINGS I WAS REALLY SHOCKED AT HOW TERRIBLE THIS DISC WAS. IT SEEMS LIKE GARY LEFT ALL OF HIS LICKS AND TALENT WITH REO WHEN HE LEFT. THIS SOUNDS MORE LIKE THE FRIST ALBUM FROM A NEW ARTIST THAT JUST DOESNT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THE CUT. ONE CAN ONLY HOPE HE RETURNS TO REO AND REVITALIZES THE BAND AND HIS CAREER."
3,Reo Cline,"I agree with everyone, if you're an REO fan, you'd love this CD. Why? Because it is essentially REO, right down to the Kevin Cronin clone. Is it any wonder that this is Gary's only CD? He's a great guitarist but why settle for an REO clone? Stick to the original!"
2,It's a Shame,"Love Richrath, even thought the Album was acceptable,but as far as I'm concerned the Vocals and Production werepoor. I will always wish him nothing but the best and hopehe keeps it up, but the vocals killed it for me."
1,This is NOT a book!,"This 3 1/2 x 5 inch 30 page advertisement is simply a brief description of how the girls met, their personalities, and their likes and dislikes. The list price is $3.99, NOT $10 as Amazon shows. Save your money on this piece of junk that should be included free with an order of a real book."
1,mega disappointment,"Expected to get a small ""book"" together with a little necklace, bookmark and bracelet. Instead, got only a stupid little leaflet which we threw away immediately. What a waste of time and money. Also this tiny little package took two weeks to arrive. There should be a category with 0 stars."
2,Animals as babysitters,"I tried this once, where I left the kids with the cat while I went to see my parents (who definitely didn't want to see their grandkids), it didn't work as well as a Rottweiler because when I got home the kids were crying because that stupid cat didn't even feed them. Their diapers hadn't even been changed. This book gives a false impression that if you leave your kids alone with your pet they will go all sorts of places and be taken care of, let me tell you maybe Carl is really special but I have know just a select few who can leave their kids with their pets, and actually have their kids provided for."
1,Carl's in charge?,"Am I the only one who is disturbed by the ""Carl"" books? I have a 2-year-old, and the first thing she wanted to do after looking at the pictures in ""Carl's Christmas"" was to ride one of our labrador retrievers. Page after page showed the baby riding on Carl's back, so I had to spend the entire time telling my daughter what a bad baby this child was for sitting on a dog. And how do you explain to a toddler why a child's parents are leaving the house and leaving no one to care for the baby except a dog? I can't think that I'm being too much of a prude here....The artistry is wonderful, and the dog baby are charming, but the ideas conveyed in this and other ""Carl"" books are one that I would spend the rest of the afternoon having to counteract."
1,Leave your baby home with the dog?,I just could not get past the idea of this book. A family leaves a baby home alone with a rottwielier on Christmas day. The dog then rides the baby on its back through the cold city streets even stopping to peer into the window of another family enjoying their Christmas together - babies included.
3,Interesting for fans of John Waite and The Babys,"The quality is pretty good considering where and when this was recorded. It is a bit raw and many of the songs are either earlier versions of Babys songs (some have changed quite a bit) or unreleased songs. I enjoyed it, but I am a HUGE fan of The Babys and John Waite. It sounds similar to the first 2-3 Babys albums, but just a little bit more raw. A good find for fans of The Babys early stuff (like I am)."
2,Underwhelmed!,"The only reason I am writing a negative review on this release, is that I am a huge Baby's fan and I made the mistake of reading the reviews before I heard the releases and was underwhelmed after hearing mostly over positive ratings. So, hopefully someone will just listen first, then read after and just be appreciative that there is some demo releases that were found and just enjoy! To me, there was reason these were not released, as is with most demos. But, I will say, If you liked the older ""broken heart album"" sound, you might like this. Personally, I started really liking them from ""Head First"" on."
4,"Great in concert album, but too much material deleted","This album is a wonderful reunion of the Limeliters after 10 years apart. The hilarious patter and six or seven tunes have been deleted from the LP version of this concert in order to fit on one CD. The complete album should be presented as a 2-CD set. Even so the instrumental backing is contemporary and the tunes are timeless. They never sang any better and their experience and love for each other comes through. Since Lou Gottlieb died a few years ago, we will never hear them live again."
4,Great to have it on CD,"I grew up on these guys, especially their reunion albums. This CD has some of those recordings, plus some extras. Some of the numbers are familiar songs, but are different recordings that what was on album. I agree that too many wonderful songs didn't make the migration to CD: Funky in the Country being one obvious one. But if you no longer have a turntable and can't play your records, this is a good CD to have."
4,still crazy after all those days,The wit and intelligence was still with this group. It was like visiting old friends - with the warm reminder of good days past.
2,Way off on fit.,When I went to purchase these mats on the Amazon website it was stated that these mats would fit my 2007 Honda Odyssey. When I received them it was obvious they expected me to cut them to fit. They are way too narrow to begin with so trimming wouldn't help. Very disappointed.
2,Disappointing follow-up to excellent predecessors,"Purtill's original Kaphtu trilogy was a minor but real and memorable pleasure to read. An interesting and original look at Greek mythology, quite unlike any other that I had come across. I was very pleased to find that he had published more, especially since these are tales referred to but never told in the first three books. However, this book was distinctly disappointing. The story was thin and unsatisfying, lacking point, structure, characterisation and even much in the way of background. The time travel element seemed entirely gratuitous. It read like (deservedly) excised chapters from the original trilogy, or possibly like the outline of a more substantial book. These significant flaws may have something to do with why it was issued through AuthorHouse, a vanity press. There were also a great many typographical, spelling and grammatical errors in the text."
3,systematic methods of chemical process design,systematic methods of chemical process design. optimal design of multipurpose chemical plants. downstream process economics in seperation process in biotechnology.
4,works well for me but can catch hair on handle,Occasionally the hair gets caught on the rubber-like handle but that may be inevitable or because I try to do too much at once. It's working well for me.
5,my wife loves it,"high quality, good price, my wife said it's the best purchase she made in several years. thank you very much."
5,FANTASTIC,"THERE'S NOT ALOT YOU CAN SAY ABOUT A BRUSH, HOWEVER, THE BRUSH CAME QUICKLY AND WORKS JUST LIKE I WANT IT TO!"
1,Hardly a page not packed with mistakes.,"This book should be avoided if you are interested in learning anything about the Portuguese language. Most pages have multiple errors in spelling, and many have grammatical errors also. If you are learning how to speak (and read) Portuguese, this book will do much more harm than good."
2,Too grammatical,"You don't want grammar in a phrase book! But this one is full of it. Nouns, adjectives, definite articles, indefinite articles, pronouns, subjects, objects, regular verbs, irregular verbs, double-stemmed verbs, you-name-it verbs. If I wanted a grammar, I would have bought one. You don't want grammar lessons in a phrase book. I find this amount of grammar in a phrase book quite out of place."
3,Politically Correct Gay Phrases & Poor Pronunciation Guide,"Here's another example of political correctness run amok. Why do we need ""gay friendly"" phrases in this book? Additionally, several Brazilian educators have said that the pronunciations ""just don't sound right"". The book is somewhat redeemed by useful sections for a number of purposes."
3,Really great! But not the best...,"Really handy! It's unbelievable the amount of rare phrases that are in this book that you can't find anywhere else (example: Pull my finger= Pushe meu dedo). It covers a wide variety of topics like food and sex and parties. However, I found that the pronunciations guide kinda sucks. I'm not sure if I learned a different accent of Brazilian Portuguese (my teacher is from Brasilia), but the phonetic pronunciations they include were way off (for example, they never mention the fact that 'te' as in 'arte' is pronounced like 'chee' as in 'cheese'). Also, the organization of the book could have been a lot better. It took me HOURS to find a basic phrase (I'm hungry) because it was not put in a section with food or anything food/restaurant related. But for the reasonable price and convenient size, it's definitely worth having."
3,"Good book, but very small","The book is quite useful, but i found it to be very limited and small! the size itself is very small, i think the description should mention that it is a ""pocket"" book."
4,Does the job,"This phrase book was helpful. The pronunciations in Portuguese are hard to figure out; they're not intuitive and are radically different than Spanish. I wish this book would help me more with that but well this is just a phrase book and one can't expect it to act like a dictionary or a language lesson book. My recommendation is to study a more comprehensive Portuguese language book before going to Brazil especially if you're interested in communicating with the locals. Most people in Brazil don't speak any English what-so-ever, so you need to learn some basic things. If you don't want to spend the time, you should at least get this phrase book and carry it with you at all times. It becomes handy!"
5,Now let us praise great works,"Neil Young is one of the very few artists who can be equally convincing as a balladeer with folk leanings, and as a heavy metallist.If this is rock and roll, then ""Rock and Roll Can never die"", as long as Neil Young lives.As an ""elder"" of popular music genres, Neil Young seems to care little for what's in fashion this season, and as a result, his music tends to stand up well as time passes. This CD sounds as powerful as anything being recorded today, manages to present excellent music from two genres: the laid back California sound of the Eagles, and the hard-edged British punk sounds of bands like The Clash.This one's a MUST"
5,"A beautiful book, filled with photos you haven't seen before","I was very impressed with Susan Maxwell-Skinner's latest publication. The book is filled to overflowing with interesting stories and observations that could only have been written by someone who knew the princess personally.The selection of photographs include many that I have never seen before.Obviously Ms. Maxwell-Skinner has many contacts that other authors writing about Diana do not.The comments written to go along with the photos give the reader an insight to what it was like to watch the princess as she married, had children and tried to make her place in the Royal Family.Diana, Memory Of A Rose was at the same time a heartwarming and tragic story to read. My husband laughed at me as I would be laughing one minute and crying the next. An all around great read."
4,Sharp out of the box!,"Very sharp out of the box, will dull over time and require resharpening. Overall great deal. The sharpner that comes with it is terrible though."
1,Big Fat Air,"One of the worst snowboarding videos I have ever seen. The camera shots are all over the place and it doesn't flow nicely. Instead you get dizzy while watching this video. The video is very out dated and not at all fun to watch. I did not understand what the host were doing and the music was just awful. Most of the jumps were old and not ""big fat air"", it was just lame. I do not recommend people to buy this video it was a total waste of money."
2,A little dated.....,"OK - this vid delivers on its title - there is big air action for sure. Unfortunately the whole thing is pretty low budget - if you're used to high budget, great music, beautifully shot snowboarding videos, then Big Fat Air will probably be pretty dissappointing. Most of the snowboarding vids I own leave me with that ""man I wish I was there"" feeling. Big Fat Air doesn't even come close."
5,"bad a%#ed footage, totally up to date with moves, stylin...","The tricks and the footage are insane, buy the video!!!"
2,So So,"The brush, to me, doesn't have a good handle. I find the Tourmaline brush to be much better. I would have returned it but the packaging had already been put into the trash."
1,only one ugly green watch band,"I ordered this thinking I got all these bands, you only get the green one. Nice how they have the picture making you think you get all of them"
5,Interesting and Compelling,"I enjoyed this small but meaningful book completely!! Ms. Upczakapproach to synchronicity and the symbolic world is refreshing and holistic. She made this complicated subject accessible to the many readers who are not familiar with synchronicity and would like to know more. The stories were interesting and heartwarming.I especially liked her exploration of the ""Hundreth Monkey Theory""..it gives me hope for our species and the planet. Thank You..."
3,~alters your attention~,"If anything, this book is a good reminder to stay attuned to what is happening around you all the time. Synchronicity is never ""just"" happening; the signs from the Universe are coming to us all the time, and, as the book points out, it is out job in this world to figure them out and use for the best of all involved. The book does not go deep into discovering/explaining the causes or meanings though.The dictionary of symbols at the end of the book is valuable.Victoria Evangelina"
3,"Hmmm, not the best.","While I appreciated the subject matter, Upczak didn't clarify or deepen my understanding of it. With all its' sentimental poetic moments, this is best a book of introduction to synchronicity. The author jumps from one person's personal experience to another's often without any transitions or clear distinctions. Yeah, you still get it of course, but that's just a lack of courtesy. Or perhaps just bad editing-along with the punctuation errors and, oh, I liked this expression reversal, the ""day of time"". Come on, did someone proofread this? Or maybe the lack of order in this book is supposed to resemble the ""seeming"" lack of order in the universe. When I turn the page, since I don't know what we're gonna read about next, maybe I'll have a meaningful synchronicity. But, I gave it three stars-only because it's a short enough reference book, and for the list of other references in the back. I'd recommend Frank Joseph's book instead."
1,Read it if you like a coffee shop talk,"I compare this to books of Dr Jung which in each sentence in detail he discusses his experiences in reading and research. This author's writting only touches Upon words without expansion of the subjects very poor refrences( none at times). I could have written a book like this too, while Dr Jung's books take 3-4 weeks to read this was a 30 minute reading in a coffee shop wasted my expresso!! It's good if you are at a level of a highschool kid but if you want something to do research on and learn, stay with Rupert S. And Dr Jung. Nice try."
4,Excellent abbreviated source on basics.,"It's not a very professional posture to adopt, but I really like the personable nature of the text...it's an enjoyable read simply on the basis of its personality!I appreciated a concise comparison of various file type and compression scheme options, and have already recommended the book to one of my customers and one of my competitors.One thing is missing from this book and its genre-a guide on what maximum resolution a variety of media will accomodate. For example, Kodak Safety Film, circa 1965, ASA100, or modern consumer and professional films. Is 5,000spi beyond the capability of particular stock?I suppose that there could be more on scanning older monochrome stock too...but the book is focused and very useable.Strong recommend."
2,Two Stars...but only because it's Frank,"What could Sinatra have been thinking? If you take away side one of the original three-LP set, you have virtually nothing of value. The first half of the first CD is good stuff, highlighted by the classic, ""It Had to Be You,"" and several other standards. The second half of the first CD has Frank singing songs of the 70s. With the notable exception of the ""Theme from New York, New York,"" this is pretty sappy. I really didn't need to hear Frank singing songs by Billy Joel and Neil Diamond. But wait, it get's worse. The second CD makes the shortcomings of the first seem minor. This is just dreadful material...so bad that even Frank's voice can't save it. I can't recommend this set."
1,Where is the second disc?,I ordered this disc for an uncle for Christmas from Amazon.com and only received one of the discs. Where is the second disc?
4,Not perfect but an excellent album,"Trilogy is a very good album. At first I didnt listen to it that much. Owning almost every Sinatra CD I thought it was ok. However, it did grow on me. I believe it is one to add to the collection later on though. Disc one runs through Sinatra's career from past to present and the 2nd disc is called the future.The past is great, the present some good and some bad and I think the 2nd disc is awesome (others will disagree). I would suggest sampling the songs first - since this album is not for everyone."
4,Haunting and lonely...,"most of the recording is very introspective, and can at times become very dark, compared to the usual sinatra swing. for me though the song ""You and me"" (we wanted it all) alone, is worth the price of admission. If you've never heard this track, heres your chance,and you get to hear a side of Frank that is not so well known."
3,"Good power supply, while it lasted.","Was a good power supply. While it lasted. Bought this power supply approx 1 year ago specifically for the pci-e connector connected to ATI Radeon HD5770) and because of low price. You really do get what you pay for. Thought Antec was a good brand...while, it was for a while. Tested with a multimeter, no power anywhere. Overall, not really worth the money for me."
1,EA380 failed after only 3 months,"Well, it was fine while it lasted. Bought on 2/18/09, the supply is broken as of mid May. Antec was unable / unwilling to answer simple questions. They are more than happy to supply an RMA but I must pick up shipping to them. I suppose any product can fail but their customer service is poor so I would suggest avoiding Antec."
1,"Chicago/Earth, Wind, & Fire - Live at the Greek Theatre","It was horrible sound quality, you could hear the band but the voices sounded like they had no mike's! It was very frustrating, because I wanted to like it, I love the bands!! It was very poor quality, I rated it one star because that was the lowest, but it was even lower than that!!"
2,too much,"While I thought it was fun to hear some of the old tunes from both of these groups(they perform separately then together at the end), overall musically they were just OK. The two lead singer/guitar player guys were about 25 and stuck out like sore thumbs, playing with these other guys in their 50-60's. One guy with EW&F jumped around the whole time he was on stage like he couldn't keep still. I'm from this era of music and I love this stuff but the production was overdone with too much jumping around and not enough musical excellence. After watching Eagles Farewell Tour I, this looked thrown together with too much fluff and not enough attention to the basics."
1,Recordings with NO SOUND,"I bought one, returned because it wouldn't play. Got another in exchange, wouldn't play. Amazon decided not to send me any more replacements. Can't comment on content of this album. Lil"
3,White Chocolate,"If it does not have Maurice White performing, it is not EWF! This has got energy, as stated elsewhere, but I have never seen Philip Bailey's troup match the earlier Japan tour with the Master White himself. So this is white chocolate...good, but it ain't the REAL thing!"
2,loved the groups not the cd's,"the 2 groups on these cd's were awesome. but in the middle of the 2nd cd,something weird happened & it cut out 2 of my favorite songs,i am so disappointed. i will be sending this back & hope to get a replacement that doesn't have this same flaw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome,I recently saw EWF / Chicago in Dallas and this video was very much like the concert I attended. I knew almost every song played. The combination of these 2 bands is awesome...they sound as if they have been playing together forever and compliment each other extremely well. I would hightly recommend this video to any EWF or Chicago fan.
5,it's a 2 disc set,"This covers the entire three hour show; total length is 173 minutes; this is direct from the production team. It includes all the songs performed the groups performed, both individually and collectively. Also has the drum duel. Looking forward to this with great anticipation...."
5,This IS A MASTEPEICE,for all you fans that like classic rock what can be a better DVD than this...Chicago & EW&F . This DVD is absolutely amazing. It contains all the classic songs from both of the legendary bands with a few special suprises and twists. This Is A MUST HAVE in any serious rock fans collection. The sound and picture is absolutely supurb. A truly TOP notch Classic dvd from 2 of the best LEGENDS of music in the business.. DO NOT miss this...
5,Great Blu Ray,I had this one as a DVD and loved it. And hoped that the Blu Ray would perfom even better. Which it does on my high end gear. Highly recommended.
5,GREAT MUSIC!,Saw this concert in person at an outside event. Great to relive the memories of seeing two AWESOME groups together!
5,chicago rocks!,"the music is what sets the stage. with majority of its members in their 60's, chicago is simply inspirational. you have got to appreciate their music composition in its full depth, variations and dynamics if nothing else. their performance is pure precision. sure, EW&F interacts with its audiences more but its music in no way can surmount chicago's -- technical and yet overladen with such graceful melody. however the two bands together just simply bring out magic. nowhere else can you enjoy six horns, three superb guitars and two bass. EW&F are movie star musicians. chicago is just simply superb musicians and every member in the band is a Bach. everyone should own this DVD. Rock on Chicago!"
4,Great Combo Show,"Two of my favorite groups of all time in one concert.Nice concert from the Greek Theatre with Chicago and Earth, Wind and Fire performing separately and together - contrasts the two styles and horn sections nicely.Great sound and the HD video looks good - lots of camera angles, but some from unmanned cameras fixed to things like the drum kit that naturally move around some when the drummer is playing - fortunately they cut away from these shots often in the editing.If you like these groups you will like this one for sure."
2,Not happening.,"This wasn't really an on night for either group.Seemed disjointed and some very off key moments. Love both bands, just not this night."
3,The oldies still shaking,They have been in the business for thirty years but still they have ability to give you a party feeling.Both band are worthy of be in the CD player. Several times.
3,12-22-06 Wont play on Xbox 360 HD DVD drive,This disk as well as the Heart disk will not play on the Microsoft Xbox 360 HD DVD drive at this time. (12-22-06) I hear that they are working on a patch.
2,Nor so Hot!,I found this disappointing! without Maurice White and Peter Cetera it's just not complete. The performance is entertainging but just falls short without the two main guys. Leroy
2,Very Dissapointing,"The performances were very average. If you want to see some good musicianship purchase the Eagles Farewell tour. EW&F and Chicago need to practice some more. I'm a fan of both bands, but this DVD is not worth having in your collection."
3,fun,"The quality of this DVD in Bluray is very good - both visually and in sound quality. Not Stunning, but very good. Bluray is an excellent medium, but only as good as the original recording. Staging and lighting in the concert were below par by today's standards, but the fun on the stage and the sheer number of musicians counteracts the lack of dazzling lighting.Chicago was excellent (their wind players especially had a lot of energy and played with inspiration), but EWF had the most mojo here. Chicago was best and most youthful when playing with EWF.This is a fun get together concert. If you're a hard core EWF and/or Chicago fan, it's worth buying, otherwise, rent it."
5,"Simply, the best DVD out there.","You will never hear better playing, better songs, better arrangements, better transitions, better vocals, feel more energy, or have a better time with any other live concert performance. The editing is superb...the 3 hours go by like 3 minutes. This is the real thing. It will restore your faith in popular music."
5,"CHICAGO/EARTH,WIND & FIRE LIVE @ GREEK THEATRE","THIS DVD WAS BEYOND MY GREATEST EXPECTATIONS. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY AFFICIONADO OF THESE TWO FABULOUS GROUPS. I SINCERELY HOPE THEY CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE TOGETHER IN FUTURE CONCERTS. BRAVO!!!! I ONLY WISH I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SEE THEM IN PERSON WHEN THEY DID THIS OR ANY OF THEIR OTHER CONCERTS. I'M A 71 YR.OLD WOMAN AND IT'S ASTOUNDING HOW THEY HAVE EFFORTESLY ACQUIRED FANS, YOUNG & OLD OF ALL GENDERS."
5,Two great tastes that go great together!,"I saw this show live in 2004 and on High Def In-Demand this year. I already have tickets for their next go 'round this summer. I am highly anticipating the release of this DVD because I do believe this to be the entire concert from start to finish. The cover of the DVD states that it is a 2-disc set, so don't go by Amazon's 92 minute description. This will be the whole 2+ hour show and it is amazing. Two of the horniest horn bands of the '70s combining forces to present all of their hits in tandem only to blow the audience away with a full collaborative finale. If you're a fan of either group, this is a must have. Fortunately I am a huge fan of both and this is an ultimate dream come true."
4,"Exciting show, but missing some ballads!","When these two bands get together, we really get our money's worth seeing these two legends, who has sold out concerts respectively, on the same stage. I gave it 4 stars because Chicago left out two of my favorite ballads- I was hoping to hear ""Look away"" (THE number one song of 1989, how can they exclude it, cmon!), and ""You're the inspiration."" I understand Chicago is back to their jazz fusion roots, but I did grow up during the Peter Cetera/David Foster 80's era, so I can't deny I miss those cheesy power ballads. No complains from EWF...they rock! I hope to see Chicago and Journey do a double concert next!"
3,Chicago/Earth Wind & Fire,"I was disappointed by Chicago does not evean sing their own hit songs-If you leave me now...,some of the song's malody has been changed by the lead singer from other band.I am not sure the DVD were an original copy."
1,Someone has to say it.,"This Blu-Ray is crystal clear and the sound captures every moment perfectly. Unfortunately, the moments perfectly captured are horrible moments! Seriously, the voices are horrendous, the tempo is slow, it's a bunch of old guys trying to be cool. It was so bad, I thought that I may never like another Chicago song ever again. It's true, because when I hear a really great original Chicago song, it brings images of this pathetic performance.It isn't nice or easy to say bad things about performers trying so hard to entertain, but someone has to say it. Save your money. Don't buy this. Keep your good memories intact.If you are wanting to build a library worthy of the best picture, sound, and editing, I can recommend Sting Live in Berlin, and Chris Botti in Boston. Both are Blu-Ray and stand at the top of picture, sound, and editing."
5,Chicago/Earth Wind & Fire - Live at the Greek Theatre,"I've been a Chicago fan all my life and if you haven't heard this band's music from the 60's-70's, this band can rock. I've never heard a better guitarist than Terry Kath, but unfortunately he's since passed away (1978). If you like Hendrix, Terry Kath is better, he taught Hendrix half of what he knew and was the only guitarist to literally floor Hendrix because Hendrix was so amazed by his performance. So unfortunately his presence is not on this dvd, but the band would agree, he's the biggest loss that band could have ever suffered. The music still lives on and I went to this concert in 2004 in Camden NJ and will be going again this July 2005. Of all the concerts I've been to, it was the best concert I've been to by far and I expect this year's round to be even better. I'm not a huge fan of R&B, but when EW&F groups up with Chicago to make a 20 manned stage performance, it's out of this world. This DVD is a must get."
4,Very good video,"Highly recommended. Very good performances by both groups, Earth Wind and Fire and Chicago. Both video and sound quality are very good as well."
5,FANTASTIC!!,I love this DVD so much. It's great to watch or just listen to. It also makes me want to see Chicago in person.
4,Great DVD - what I expected,"I saw EWF live recently, and this DVD captures the essence of the concert for me to keep! Great sound, well done.Chicago didn't age as well as EWF, in my opinion, but it was good to hear Make Me Smile and the overture that followed again and see it performed.For someone that loved these two bands, as I did, this is the DVD to have."
3,History,It's a lot of reading because there is so much info. At least every other sentence is worth noting.
5,A Fresh Voice,"The poems reveal the tenderness of her work. In her writing, she achieves an innovative way to express what she believes is real in this world - thoughts that many of us have but do not reveal. I had never heard of the author but was pleasantly surprised."
4,Ronco Party Time Rotisserie,"Bought this for my sons 21st birthday party.I had 20 people invited . This was a good choice for making 30 pieces of chicken with a special barbeque rub that everyone raved about. Beats Kentucky fried chicken anyday. The basket though didnt seem to want to stay closed , so I had to maually tie the ends together to keep from opening while turning in oven. Also the manual is a little shy of proper instructions in assembling the basket to the rotesserie. Took me a couple of times to fiqure out proper assembly. I am having Easter Brunch and am going to try Hams. There is no recipe or recommendations on how to prepare in book , so going to wing it.It also leaves my oven open for other preperations as needed."
5,Great Album,This is an excelelntly written album. Luckily Three of the members are now making new music together.
2,not that great,So I used to love this heater. It served me well for a little under a year. But just tonight as I was trying to turn it on the plug had a tiny explosion and the reset button melted. I have no idea what caused it but I found it very unnerving. Now looking for a replacement. Not sure if I will replace it with the same model.
4,Works Great,"We installed this disposal a couple weeks ago, and so far it works great. I only wish it were a touch quieter."
4,Cracked,"SEEMS TO WORK FINE, VERY QUITE BUT DRAWS POWER ENOUGH TO SURGE THE TV.ALSO THE OUTSIDE PLASTIC CASE WAS CRACKED. WHAT UP WITH THAT???????"
2,Too Quiet!!! Could be a danger to Consumer. Should be recalled,Although the Insinkerator Evolution Pro garbage disposer works well I would like to offer a word of caution. This garbage disposal may just be too quiet! When the water is running in the sink and the garbage disposer is on it is impossible to know that the garbage disposer is actually running because there is very little noise.Even when the disposer is on and the water is not running it is quiet. For people with slight hearing problems this could be a real hazard/danger.After all our society is conditioned to know that disposal are in fact loud. When they are loud they warn us to stay away. This model however is way too quiet and i would think that this then can be a hazard. This is an example of technological improvements in an appliance that are actually not improvements at all but rather possible dangers. Ours has been in place for 2 weeks and I want it to be replaced by our plumber. This model should be recalled
1,vibrator extension cord sbe115 for Sonic Boom Alarm clocks,"I haven't received the extension cord yet!!1 I know I paid for it, it showed up on my AMEX bill!! I am going to give AMAZON another chance to ship me my extension cord. If i don't receive any action on this issue, I will report this to AMEX and continue on from there.Also, I received my order for my leather jacket. It was all wrinkled. I had to send it out (for a fee of $39.00) to get the wrinkles removed. I will pick up the coat on Wed., Dec. 20. I will let you know.I also received my Sonic Boom Alarm Clock, which seems to be intact.Signed,REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
1,Where's the clock?,Have ordered two sonic boom alarm clocks and have been waiting since feb 1st...bought extension cord for what? Hope I have alarm sent soon. Do not order this product until you have used your alarm. Waste of money waiting on a back order!
3,Make sure nothing heavy falls on top of this cord,"I bought one of these for my Sonic Boom alarm clock. It worked fine for many months, then there were a few days when my alarm went off, but the bed shaker didn't. I never set my alarm with sound, because I don't want to wake the rest of my house up, so I depend on the shaker to wake me up on time. I finally found out the culprit was my backpack, which had fallen onto the extension cord. This extension cord is not durable at all! I ended up buying both a new alarm clock and cord in the same models, because I was not sure which was the problem. So buyer beware: make sure nothing falls onto this cord and that no one steps on it, because it's very touchy and temperamental."
3,Feather/Down Twin Comforter,"I purchased this item and at the same time purchased another comforter directly from Amazon. I was disappointed in this one (Marrikas), due to it being very thin and being 95% feathers and only 5% down. The other comforter that I purchased from Amazon was much nicer (for a similar price) in that, it was fluffier/fuller, much nicer.I feel that the price on this comforter should be less due to the quality of the product."
4,Enjoyable,"I like all the performances whether frozen in time or expanded and evolved. Some of the bands have nothing to offer beyond nostalgia, but that's ok. Eric Burdon is still a dynamic performer who continues to create new music and rework the classics he is noted for. I wouldn't blame Eric for not doing the songs the same way as 40 years ago. The producers should have known what Eric does since he has reworked his classics over and over again throughout his career. I think it would have been more fun if Eric had done ""I Used To Be An Animal""."
3,"Could've been great, but.....","Great selection of artists and songs,BUT: Eric Burdon should've sung his hits with the original arrangements and this show should have been recorded with better sound equipment. The sound on this DVD is only in stereo and TERRIBLE at that!I'll still watch it from time to time, but the above mentioned 2 items take away from my full enjoyment of this disc."
4,This music lives on...,"There is something very special about the music that came out of the 60's. The British Invasion played a large role in how it evolved. I waited over six months for this program to air on PBS, only to find that the local PBS station had chosen not to air it. I had to wait another three months before I finally got to view the show. I do so wish I had gone last summer. Having the opportunity to see so many of the artists I listened to in my early youth would have been a real treat. The Foundations, The Dakotas, Wayne Fontana, I still listen to them. My kids listen to them. I have seen Peter Noone on a few (dozen) occasions, and he always puts on a great show. Always. He still has the spark and energy of a fiftenn year old. Watching him makes me feel like a kid again, too. I for one am thrilled to have this video to watch between shows."
3,The Big Bang,I enjoyed the book. It was a very interesting concept and it kept my interest and attention.My rating of 3 stars can be explained by my feeling that only a classic should get 5 stars and 4 stars would be a really outstanding book.I did enjoy the book very much.
1,Dissapointed,"I'm still waiting for my item.. From 8 Decemer untill now no item, no news.. sorry for dislike but it has never happend before. I used to get my items from USA within 2 weeks maximum and now I'm waiting for one month and the parcel still in Chicago. Very strange."
3,CONFUSING,"HAVE ALL 4 OF THESE SCARLETT BARBIE'S IN THE SERIES.THE 1ST SERIES. AT FIRST I LIKED THEM ALOT NOW I DON'T ANYMORE, THEY JUST SIT IN THEIR BOXES ON A SHELF. WISH I COULD SELL THEM BUT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY MONEY. THEIR NOT WORTH IT."
3,More product info,"The artist self masters the CDs thus the reason for their look. They have a second CD out ""GOD AND CEASAR IN AMERICA""...which is not currently being sold by Amazon.Though I do know the real names of the artists, since they choose not to list their names I'm not.. as the goal is for the music to slf it's self not the name to sell the music.Though the second CD they have out does list their real name, which not only they self mastered as well but self published.-------Not really a fan of this music my self but there is a copy of both CDs in my collection. Reguardless felt it needed more info then what it had."
5,Winnie the Pooh's Cookie Book,"One of the best cookie cookbooks around. I especially love the coffee cookies, but so many of these are delicious winners!"
5,"Great flavor, excellent all around cooking flavor.","One of the most versatile of the Trager pellets. We have used for pork, beef roast as well brats. You can even smell the mesquite flavor when reheating the food as leftovers in the microwave."
2,extremely expensive,"These are extremely expensive, i wish i could find them cheaper. However they are cheaper on Amazon than through a dealer"
4,Perfect for a day at the beach or a lazy day in front of the fire,"Christa Fairchild's Duchess On The Run read like a relaxed day at the beach. It was sweet, innocent and enjoyable. But, like any good beach, there are always a few delicious surprises around and this book is no exception. Although delightfully written, you should know that Duchess On The Run also has a few moments that will demand you stop reading the pages so you can fan yourself with them.Fairchild's main characters, Elizabeth and Graham, are good, honest people who have struggled with love gone bad, but they both risk all to try love one more time. Hesitantly, their love blossoms, while dealing with people and problems that threaten to destroy them and their lives, but they will need all that and more to make it through to happily ever after. If you've not visited Nebraska, might I suggest you go there via Broken Bow and Christa Fairchild's Duchess On The Run."
5,Great biography,"With so many reviews already, it is hard to add much so I'll keep this short and sweet. This is a great book and the seminal biography of Davis. Historians will be hard pressed to top Cooper's work. The book on the years preceding the Civil War were, at times, not overly inspiring, but the chapters on the war years and Davis' post-war life more than made up for it. Page turning reading and solid research to boot. This book is the best kind of history--readable, entertaining, yet solidly researched and educational as well. Having read other books that discussed Davis in varying capacities, I feel like I have a much better grasp on Davis the man than ever before. Highly recommended for any and all history buffs."
4,"An excellent biography of a great, flawed man","Jefferson Davis was a political giant in the U.S., a man who would almost certainly have been President of the United States if he'd been born ten years earlier, and a good one. Davis dominated Mississippi politics from the time he entered it, losing one election by a narrow margin when he was drafted late in the race to replace a tremendously unpopular candidate, and winning all the others handily. He served four years as Secretary of War, and was widely considered the foremost living southern statesman before the Civil War.Instead, Davis is remembered as the only President of the failed Confederate States of America. This is an excellent biography of one of the most important figures in U.S. history, giving a fine portrait of the strengths and weaknesses of a complicated man."
4,The New Standard Biography,"This work must be seen as the new standard biography of Jefferson Davis. It is well-written and well-researched. The first half is a long tough read -- the early chapters of Davis's military career are good, but the ones on Mississippi and Congressional politics can easily be skipped in order to get to the Civil War quicker. Very good in portraying Davis as a politician travelling the CSA to show his face to the public, discerning statements made to certain newspapers for political purposes, the politics of various appointments. From the military point of view, the author is a Lee man, and an apologist for the various disastorous decision Davis made in the west."
3,May not work,"This item is actually a CD-Rom, not DVD. It would not load on my home computer (32 bit), but it did load and run on my office computer (32 bit, Windows XP), on this one it seems O.K. and to slowly take one through a version of the fundamentals of addresing Chinese, by character and and sound. The Transparent Language website says that it no longer supports ""Power Chinese"". However I have received some advice from them by email."
1,Compatibility issues with this discontinued program,"Based on the reviews here, I bought this software and it has been a big disappointment. Not because of the exercises or the dated graphics, even, but the fact that I get error messages (General Protection Faulty) only after a few minutes of using the program. I've contacted technical support, but their response that this is an older version designed for Windows 98, and that I should consider buying their newer version (for XP). Had I known this is an outdated version, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place! Also, a handful of the characters do not have pronounciation, which could be a glitch. Beware! (The company has offered to give me a refund, since the software is basically useless on my computer.)"
3,"Content good, but has compatability issues","This program only accepts two resolutions to run it. 1024 X 768 and 600 X 800. Because I have a widescreen laptop, it is a huge pain to adjust my screen to these settings.The program looks like it was created for Windows 95 and was updated minimally to be compatable with XP.Contentwise, it looks pretty good and does a good job of teaching in my opinion. However, if you don't want to mess with the settings on your computer, I would suggest finding a different program."
5,EXCELLENT KJV study guide!!!,"If you want to understand the Bible all you need is a KJV Bible and this STRONG study guide, it brings the Bible to life and helps you understand Hebrew and Greek words, it also has a dictionary to define words for you. Purchase one today! Not all of the newer Bibles do God's word justice as the KJV does."
5,Stronger Then Ever,It's just as I expected from Strongs. A great bible resource tool especially for those who consider themselves to be students of the bible.
5,good,i have been trying to find this book for quite some time. had one but misplaced it some how very informitive.
5,Buy this one,"If you are in need of a concordance the Strong's is by far the best and this one is improved, the words of Christ is in red and it is easy to follow, the reference number is located to the right of the word you are researching and the Hebrew is in normal type while the Greek is in italic type print and this makes it easy to reference, also appearing within the enhanced definition are cross-references to to other leading word dictionaries. This gives a better understanding of words in the King James Version that may have left you in question before, it is much better to be able to see the word meaning from the original transcripts. It also has a complete topical index, includes the Harmony of the Gospels, the parables of Jesus, the miracles of Jesus and much more."
5,Wonderful,"I bought this for my son who is in prison. You might think this is a bad thing, but God has given my son a ministry from the inside out. When God is finished with him he will come out. He has led 10 men to Christ so far. He said it was the best concordance and it has helped him to bring the light to the Gospel in a greater way.Patricia Menville"
5,Stong's Concordance,Fantastic reference to go along with anyone looking to dive head first into the Bible. This is easy to use and is not so small that you will need a magnifying glass to read it. Great resource!
5,Good reference book,"What I wanted and at a good price. Very comprehensive reference work , easy to use, replaced a concordance that had much to be desired."
5,Great study tool.,"If you really enjoy diving into the scriptures to seek and gain a deeper understanding into Gods Word, then this is a must have. I am not a Bible scholar, but I love exploring Gods Word to gain a richer understanding by unlocking the scriptures. This has been with me ever since I bought it, and it has helped me a lot. It arrived on time and was in great shape. I highly recommend this for any Christian wanting to deepen their relationship with Jesus."
5,Excellent choice for bible study,"I bought this book in the hopes of developing my bible study skills. If you have the same goal in mind, I highly recommend this book. Astoundingly detailed and easy to navigate."
5,Truly a Quality Item,"Well crafted, detailed beyond expectations, the title doesn't do it justice. Anyone faithful to the word of God would want one in their home."
1,Broke me out,"First I must add that I have very good skin. I rarely break out and so if I do I know what the cause is. After just two days of taking this product I started to get itchy pimples, one big one on my forheard and littleones around my eyes. I had acne when I was a teenager and I don't want to go there again! Will notcontinue to use this product."
2,Bad reaction,"Have talked to others who were pleased with this product, but I gave it up after two days due to light headedness. Plan to try it again, but waiting for a good time."
3,wish it did more,Been taking it pretty regular for about a month. Don't see much help for sore knee or recovery from rotator cuff surgery but fingernails do seem stronger. Not muchnew on hair growth or strength.
1,couldnt tell any difference;,"i could not tell any differece while taking this product. maybe you have to take it for a year, i dont know."
1,Didn't work for me,"I had high hopes for this product to help me with my aching knee problem, but it didn't do a thing for me. I gave it to my wife to try for her skin, but she didn't see any improvement."
5,Fantastic product!,"I love this product. I've been using it for years. I have a condition which causes my eyes to swell, and this product prevents the swelling. I also give the pills to my 16 year old dog. She was having trouble walking, and this helps her joints. My vet is amazed at the improvement in her mobility. You can't go wrong with this product!"
3,Mint taste,I didn't like this minty taste. I usually take my supplement with a meal and I was dreading this minty flavor!
2,not as advertised,"I specifically searched for items that stated that they where dishwasher safe. The invoice description says dishwasher safe and then a little cardboard sleeve on each item stating ""Handwash all fine cutlery"". Will never order from Rada again and will think twice about Amazon."
2,Nothing Special,"This is quite a pleasant read and the author has quite a funny turn of phrase, but overall the book is nothing special. It's hard to enthuse about a book where the main charachter goes to the middle of India, has no interest in his job, and nothing really happens. So what?I found there were an excess of charachters in the book, who didn't really add anything to the story line. Also, the author is over-fond of pooping jokes. Quite funny in the first chapter or so, but by the time you've read your hundredth one towards the end of the book, they really start to grate."
4,Out of Control,"This book came at just the right time when I was wrestling with issues. I didn't realize that the issues I was dealing with had to do with control, afterall, I thought I had given it up to God! Thanks Lisa"
4,Out of Control and Loving it,Thanks for the quick response and mailout. Im doing a bible study and all the book stores in our area were OUT of the book so thanks for helping me out!
2,Not a very good heater,"I work in an office in CT that is all glass. In the winter our central heating system has some trouble keeping up b/c it's very, very cold near the windows and this heater is NOT good. Other space heaters I've had are able to warm the room much quicker and maintain that temperature.This heater doesn't get very hot. You can touch it when it's set to it's highest setting. I suppose it would be good to keep a storage room above freezing or maybe it'd be good around pets or kids since you couldn't possibly burn yourself on it.For the price you're going to pay, I say skip this one and keep looking."
1,Poor singing and recording,"This album isn't really worth getting. Leon Lai's singing is very flawed, especially when recorded in live conditions. The recording itself is also unsubtle and overblown. One can't even hear clearly the words. Strictly for the singer's fans only."
4,Not the normal marriage book,"I have read plenty of marriage and relationship books, and this one was definitely different from most. I appreciated the focus on each spouse's relationship with God as the impetus for desiring to be a better mate and to serve your spouse. It was somewhat philosophical, and I prefer a practical approach to things. But it was good if you would like a different perspective."
1,Worst mouse I've owned,"1. Drivers provided with mouse do not work with Windows XP. Updating with drivers on website does not help. Defuault XP mouse driver works (sort of-- see below).2. Mouse locks up several times a day, requiring a hard system reboot to resume operation.3. mouse occasionally goes into continuous-scroll mode in Microsoft Word and Excel.I would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Ok for 1/2 the price...,"The Kensington Pocketmouse Pro Wireless is a nice standard size mouse. Feels heavy with the battery, and has the cool feature of storing the usb transceiver so you don't have to worry about losing it. Only complaint is that the either the optics or the wireless circuits suck. It tracks like a dirty ball mouse, but maybe I'm just spoiled from the mx500 I use on my desktop....... I would expect better mouse performance from a $... mouse. Seems more like the type in the $... bin, which is where they should put it and come out with a better design."
1,Don't use on Dell Inspiron 8500,"The mouse works fine but I give it a 1 star because of the incompatability with the MouseWorks software with the Dell Inspirion 8500. The Dell Inspiron 8500 has a built in track pad and pointing stick which is configurable from the mouse control panel.After you install MouseWorks, all configuration options in the mouse contol panel gets replaced by the MouseWorks software. As a result, the track pad or pointing stick configuration options gets removed. The track pad and pointing stick still works but there is no way to configure it. Luckily, Windows XP has system restore so I manage to restore everything back the way it was.Too bad Kensington did not create the Pocketmouse Pro Wireless without the requirement to install the MouseWorks software like there PocketMouse Pro with the retractable cord. Otherwise, it would be a great mouse."
1,Battery life very poor,"We purchased this mouse with our Dell laptop. We have to change batteries every 2 -4 days and we are using Duracell Ultra's. If we remember to unplug it every night we may get an extra day out of it. We are always having to reset it by pressing the mouse button with the usb connection. Would not recommend this mouse. It does work well, when it works, but who wants a mouse that only works really well for a day or two."
4,Kensington Pocketmouse Pro Wireless,"this was a good buy...kind of. until i installed the software from the kensington site, the mouse could only click. also, the mouse feels flimsy...nothing like my old logitech wireless...the optical keeps screwing up, because the mouse, if i am moving it up the screen, will suddenly go the opposite direction...really annoying while playing fps games on my presario x1000...like you are sniping some guy and the mouse flips out...so this is good for a business, awful for gaming"
4,Very satisfied,"There were two reviews submitted when I bought this mouse, one very positive and the other negative. I took a chance and bought it because I needed a wireless mouse and Costco had it for a good price, and it was bundled with a Kensington USB portable hub. The mouse works beautifully. There have been comments about the size - I think it's perfect; any smaller and it would not be comfortable. The only thing that would make it better would be an off switch so I wouldn't have to remove the USB receiver to save battery life."
1,"Good design, but it just doens't work!","I ordered this mouse along with my new laptop three weeks ago, and now I'm already shopping for a new mouse.First of all, after couple minutes of not using, I have to somehow shake the mouse in order to get the pointer move again. Especially when my laptop goes into screensaver mode - a simple ""twitch"" doesn't do it. I have to shake my poor mouse like a madman to get out of the screensaver. Second- scrolling is very choppy. Sometimes I scroll down, and the scrollbar moves up (and vice versa). Also, sometimes I have to click twice because nothing happens on my first click.I'm so disappointed that I spent this much money on this mouse. Kensington needs to work on some quality testing before releasing their products.Like right now, after typing this review, my mouse isn't responding again so I just had to shake it couple times to click the submit button - that is, if I can get it on my first click...I really do *not* recommend this mouse."
2,"Excellent looks and right weight, terrible performance","This was a total rip off. I was excited when opening the package, in order tu plug it and start moving all around he screen; Instead, the hardware recognized the mouse but it would not work until ten minutes had passed afetr pluging in.After that, the mouse seems to work only when it feels like working, and that is not very common. It freezes for many minutes with no response whatsoever. I am considering returning it for a full refund"
1,need to change battery every 3-4days,The battery life of this product is really too bad. I need to change the battery every 3-4 days. I don't know how they can put such an inmature product in the market. My another IBM wireless mouse need to be change for several months.
4,Works well so far,"Have been using it for a week now - works well so far. My only advice to Dell Notebook users - DO NOT install Mouseworks - it replaces your touchpad software and does funny things with the mouse - such as on left click does right click, on right click does nothing.On Windows 2000 on Dell laptops - just plugin, wait for default USB install and tune the speed settings slower than your touchpad settings and use.More updates a few weeks from now - battery life, durability etc."
2,Bad button and poor battery life.,"Like many other reviewers, my mouse's left button broke after a few weeks. I'd click once and it would register as if the button was being held down. This happens randomly (about every 20 clicks). It becomes mind-numbingly annoying. I'll probably buy a new (different brand of) mouse and be done with it.Also, battery life is POOR. If you buy this mouse, better buy a crate of AAA batteries. Blah!"
5,"Great mouse, nice price","I purchased this mouse to go with my Toshiba laptop and WinXP operating system. It has worked flawlessly! It works on all kinds of surfaces and travels extremely well. Storing the receiver in the mouse was a great idea for extended battery life and has the added benefit of extra compactability. It also has a nice feel to it. The curve of the mouse seems to be slightly higher and fits perfectly in the palm of my hand, allowing my fingers to rest straight across the buttons. I don't seem to experience as much fatigue in my hand as with other mice."
4,"Works well, needs off switch","Seems to work very well (only been using for a couple of hours now).You need to install MouseWorks software which is only available on Kensington's web site before you can really use it. It will work out of the box, but not well. This software is not provided in the package -.5 star.Also, no off switch on the mouse. You need to remove the receiver from the USB and place it back inside the mouse before it will shut off. This is really annoying if you frequently use your laptop as a desktop -.5 star.But, that aside this product seems to work very well. Wireless rules!"
2,Make sure you buy the service contract with this,"I have had two of the PocketMouse Pro Wireless Mouse. I also did not install the driver software as it caused a software conflictl. The first one I owned, the cover that holds the USB device broke and Kensington replaced it. On the second one, the scroll wheel broke in less than a year and I will not get another one. I will try another brand."
1,The mouse designed by committee.....,"Apparently everyone on the design team got a piece of the pie except the users. Claimed range of 3-feet is about 18-inches, at best. ""You will not need drivers"", wrong again during a late night download. This one just does not do it at all as I shop for a replacement for my brand new mouse..."
2,"Works, but so-so quality and poor support","Worked right after I plugged into my XP laptop. Glad didn't have to install no driver. But quality is not as good as Logitech or Microsoft products, and customer service is poor... would not answer PC questions! So if you have a Macintosh and hate Apple's sissy mice, this might be for you. Windows users (that's 99% of us) better stay away."
3,Fun old receipes from back in the day.,This cookbook is filled with fun old receipes from back in your mom and grandparents day. Some are still good and worth making and some are good fun to read about.
2,Say What? Say Yeah,Utopia was at the top of thier game on this tour but the video and audio quality of this DVD is just awful. The bonus interviews are great and make the item worth picking up for nostalgia purposes only. Get Redux '92 if you want some great Utopia live stuff on DVD
3,Limited 540i Coverage,"If you own a 540i, be aware that coverage of this model is quite limited in this manual. For instance, information on the problematic ZF 5HP30 transmissions in these is almost non-existent. Doing a routine fluid change is covered by less than a page of instructions and one crude drawing. This information is hardly comprehensive, or even accurate and I ended up limping the car to the shop to mop up when I had finished. When I changed engine oil for the first time, I was forced to look through discussion groups to find the location of the oil filter as there are no pictures. I finally bought a copy of the E38 (7-Series) manual which has a lot better coverage. Using the two manuals together seems to work best."
4,A Spirited Read,"A rich and varied compendium of interesting, entertaining, and thoughtful quotes on drinking, Bottled Wisdom is the perfect tonic for the ill-view that a minority in our society take toward the culture of alcohol. Best shared with a friend over a tasty beverage, this book offers humorous and thoughtful quotes. In fact, some of the best quotes are surprising in content and authorship. Just as a visit to a quality bar should be, this anthology will make you smile, laugh, and reflect on life. You will make new friends and be happy to see some old cronies in these pages. Pollman has done his homework and offers a varied and rich anthology. Reigle's illustrations are good and complement the text without overpowering the words. For the imbiber that has everything, this book is the perfect holiday gift."
5,"A ""spirited"" rendition; like an evening at the ""Hounds""","Mark has done a fabulous job of collecting some classic ""wisdom"" as well as a whole lot of wonderful new material. I now have a habit of purchasing a copy of the book for all of my ex-U.S. co-workers (after a visit with Mark at the pub, of course) to show them that American humor and ingenuity are alive and well !! I suspect that there are a number of foolish publishers out there ""cryin' in their beer"" over this lost opportunity ! This book is a great gift for yourself or anyone who appreciates great wit and a tasty libation."
4,Good book!:),"This was a great book. It was not that hard to get into and was very interesting. When I read it I learened a lot of things I never knew before, about those times. It was not the best book I have ever read but it wasn't the worst either. Hope you enjoy:)"
3,Don't Bother Preparing to be Wow'ed,"First, I have NO idea why there are so many versions of this for Kindle and why they all have different prices. I made sure that the version I'm reviewing is the one I purchased.This was a book that I was much looking forward to reading. It was actually a title that swayed my decision to get a Kindle2. It was free when I first saw it on the search page, but had a price by the time I got back around to it. I don't need my money back, but it barely eeked through giving me $1.99 of enjoyment. Many of the characters were caricatures. Because of the nature of the story, with Gods being real and taking back the world, I kind of got the sense that the authors intended it that way. But it made it impossible for me to invest in the characters. There was a fair amount of fade-to-black sexual content. It was 1940s style, so more read as hokey.Overall, a leisurely, enjoyable read that I will forget I ever even heard of within a year."
2,Boring... so boring...,Way too convenient and predictable... but the entire SW universe is... and so very boring and dry. The NJO series was terrible.
2,Ugh.,"Whose idea was it to let this slop stretch into a trilogy? All of the important points could have been condensed into a single novel (or maybe even a short story). The New Jedi Order does bring an exciting new plot arc to the Star Wars universe, and there have been some great books in the series, but once we get toward te end, the true marketing genius becomes clear; a reader who has already read a dozen novels and gotten caught up in the story of the war with the Vong, will work their way through even the worst book to make it to the end of the series. Or indeed, the worst three books. Only a couple of interesting bits (like the Tahiri subplot) save this from a 1 star review."
1,Please don't let these guys write another Star Wars book!,"This book is (as another review so aptly put) nothing more than absolute filler material.It is by far the weakest book in the whole New Jedi Order series - even worse (if you can believe it) than Dark Journey.I won't waste my time writing a lengthy review for this as I put so much into my review for the first book in this ""Force Heretic"" trilogy.Suffice it to say that this entire trilogy by Sean Williams & Shane Dix is complete rubbish and brings the entire ""New Jedi Order"" series to an all-time low!If you haven't read the trilogy yet, do yourself a favor and skip it. There are plenty of reviews that summarize it well enough for you to get the jist without having to suffer through the poor writing style of these clowns."
2,Does not meet expectations,"I was expecting this three book series to pick up the pace, but sadly it seems to go down the slope. Three main stories, the male twin solo looking for a mystical planet called Zonama Sekot with the help of Master Skywalker, Jaina Solo and Tahiri fight a disguised Yuuzhan Vong infiltration somewhere in the universe and last but not least Nom Anor returns as a prophet leading Shamed Ones in his struggle to infiltrate the chambers of the Supreme Overlord.All in all, as a NJO fan you follow the stories where they take you and you enjoy letting your imagination loose in the universe of Star Wars. But these books seem to stretch a story that can be fit into a single book.I hope the third book really stands up. Books like these make you feel like a grain of sand in a marketing world. Where all you do is contribute your buy and keep on reading."
3,More filler in the SW Universe,"I am one of the fans that hopes this series ends on a high note. The initial books were really well done and interesting, but I find myself buying these latest additions to the SW universe because of fan loyalty. Heretic II is a decent book, but I must agree with many of my fellow reviewers that it is somewhat predictable. I was never a fan of the Bakura story when it first came out, and the sudden about face of the Ssi-ruuk and the subsequent storyline seemed a little unimaginative. Tahiri's problems continue to be my favorite story line, especially as the Ssi-ruuk and Jacen's adventures in Chiss space are rather dull. Nom Anor also proves to be an interesting character, but again, it appears that this is at the expense of the classic SW characters. Overall, it is a decent read, but don't get your expectations up too high. I hope that the conclusion of the New Jedi Order will make more of us fans happier."
3,Somewhere in the middle,"I am sumewhat taken aback by all of the negative reviews. I have read better books in the overall series and I've read worse. This book is simply the means of getting from point A to point B. If anything, I feel the authors are a bit too constrained. Venturing into Chiss territory should have invoked more imagination. With so many books making up the Star Wars universe, there are very few instances to give things a shot in the arm. The other two story lines, offer opportunity for an interesting conclusion to the NJO series. I also think the transitions were well-written and harken back to earlier works.Pick up this book knowing that it is the SIXTEENTH book in a series. If you are looking for something profound, stick with classic literature."
2,part two of Betty Landers's review,"Appologies for doing a split review, but this one is to focus on the chop-job of an abridgement. When I read this book, I read the audio abridgement and there was no mention of the vong at all, and Jason in the library was only mentioned at the very end. The entire thing focused on Bakura, and as many others have said, it's a complete waste of paper."
2,dissapointing!!!,"abosolutly dissapointing. the authors writting style is confusing and boring. nothing advances in the war with the vong. only pointless side ""adventures"". there are 3 storylines and the author cycles between all 3 with out any warning. as soon as you start getting interested in one of the storylines you're whisked away without any warning whatsoever. the only reason i finished this book is because i am a die hard star wars fan. save your money...this trilogy is pointless."
2,seemingly a side note,"A whole book without the Vong? To me, that seems to defeat the purpose of having it in the series. It seemed uninspired and unnecessary for the cyruke (sorry for the misspelling) to make an appearance when we've been focused on the vong for the last 15 books. I'm looking forward to the next few books to see how this ends up tying in with the rest of the series, but as a stand-alone with knowledge of the 15 preceeding books,, it's a disappointment to me."
1,Where was quality control when this book was written,"Talk about a waste of trees, This series seems to be a continuing downward spiral. It is pitiful that you have a series that has spent the past 14 books creating interest excitement and intrigue with quality authors and top notch story lines only to get to the fifteenth and sixteenth book to be completely let down. A plot that doesn't go anywhere or create interest and a story that fails to captivate combined with author(S) who fail miserably at jumping from subplot to subplot in an intelligent manner . The saddest thing of all is that we will continue to buy the series because we hope that something in this sub series will be important to the next authors book. So this author gets a best seller fo sub par work."
5,A Great book for a great series,I found this book a very good read. It was very enjoyable. I don't understand all the negative reviews that this book has gotten from people writing reviews here on amazon. This is a great book.
4,Nice variety of heart-felt gospel,"Note: the Stephanie Bennett who recorded this gospel album ""He Sent Jesus to Rescue Me"" is a completely different person from the Stephanie Bennett who did the other albums listed on Amazon (which feature harp and span new age, children's and neo-classical.)THIS Stephanie Bennett made a really nice record of a variety of Christian songs, from a traditional gospel feel to a more contemporary sound. The variety is really refreshing.Her voice is nice and gentle (not one of those hit-you-over-the-head gospel voices, in case that's what you're looking for.) You can tell that the feeling of both the vocalist and the backing musicians is sincere and loving.Overall, it creates a really nice mood of sincere praise."
5,A Wonderful Book for singles or the family,"Both my finance and I have a hard time putting this book down. It is a book for every occassion and is almost always, able to provide a prayer or blessing that is right on the mark. A great diversity of prayers for just about any occasion. A great wedding gift or for friends."
5,pumpkin season,"I recently purchased this dvd for my 3 kids (ages 2, 4, and 8). All of them thought it was fantastic. My youngest ones watched it repeatedly. My oldest also loved the pictures and the story. It was worth the purchase! I highly recommend it."
1,Boring & overpriced,"I bought this for my children and they couldn't get through it. It is very dull and basically just a book being read outloud. I wish I had read these reviews before buying it. I recommend ""Spookley The Square Shaped Pumpkin"" instead. My kids loved that DVD. It was much more interesting, and cheaper, than this boring book read aloud DVD."
1,Disappointed,"Wish I had seen the boring review before I purchased the DVD for my 4 year old grandaughter. I was expecting a movie with a read along book ( guess I didn't read close enough) My granddaugher loves books and movies , but this was neither and was boring. I didn't enjoy even listening to the story myself. Was overpriced considering the DVD Spookley is so much better. She begs this to be read to her and to watch the movie. Was a waste of $$$$ in my opinion."
2,Disappointed,I was not as impressed with the graphics as I had hoped. Also my son doen'st like to watch it.
2,Disappointing and stupid,"I got this because it looked like it would work as a good pregnant belly for a costume. It turned out to be so overstuffed that it just looked fat, lumpy, and ridiculous. I had to take out the majority of stuffing and rig up something with half a styrofoam ball from a craft store and it took multiple adjustments and wasted a ton of time. If you don't really care about the realisticness of your costume then this is fine but it would be out of place anywhere other than a frat party"
1,Poor fit.,"2 big of a belly on it and a very poor fit. Not worth sending back as it would not be cost effective with shipping costs, etc."
3,Useful little book,"This book was very thought provoking in relation to issues in delivering a good homily. In an age when good preaching is a rare art, hopefully this book will support those committed to preaching the Word of God with skill and presence."
1,Not very good,"This is a very poor attempt at a freehand book. It struggles to cover the 'this is where the buttons are', and doesn't do much more. No real expertise or skill is shown to the reader, and from an english and grammatical point of view, it isn't much better. Most of the book feels like filler. I regret buying it."
3,Beautiful story -- but told in free verse,"This is a beautiful story of a courageous girl, trusting in the kindness of strangers and hoping to find freedom. It's an Underground Railroad story that we love, because the illustrations are beautiful and the story suspenseful.It is time to give all children -- but especially black American children -- the opportunity to read good stories about their people told in standard English. It is so disappointing to find that nearly all the inspirational black history stories are told in free verse. Why is that, anyway? Aren't we teaching our kids how to succeed in America anymore?"
5,Poetry on the run,"This beautifully written book is poetry and artwork, sharing a significant story we all need to hear."
1,The myth continues.,"How sad that children are being taught fiction as though it was history. Quilts were not made as maps to help slaves escape to Canada; many people risked their lives to help slaves get to Canada and freedom. Those people, both black and white, are the real heroes!It's very sad that this myth continues.Quilts, though warm and lovely, don't need to be brought into the equation."
2,Boring,"I like relaxing music. I really do.And I like flute music. And Celtic music.But I am baffled why anyone would think highly of this CD.The best tracks (some - like ""Over the Sea to Skye"") are like some of Enya's sleepier recordings. The worst tracks (many - like ""The Minstrel Boy"" and ""Danny Boy"") are like New Age elevator music. There is a difference between music that is relaxing and music that is mindless drivel. On this CD you get both.The only saving grace is James Galway's virtuosity but the choice of songs and the way they are orchestrated is poor. I listened to this CD twice and now am trying to find a way to dispose of it. Not recommended.A much better CD of similar virtuosity but great music is Chris Norman, ""Man with the Wooden Flute."" And James Galway has probably produced better CD's than this."
2,Small Work Book,I didn't realize when I bought this that it was just a small booklet in work book format. Not very useful to me. I was looking for a reading book by this auther and on this topic.
1,For the math geek with time to burn,"If you crave portable computation of disparate obscure and advanced mathematics, this is your ""cup of tea."" However, don't be misled by the editorial review; read the preview of the table of contents that illustrates the limited inclusion of basic mathematics. You could take your TI-89 computations to cocktail parties to show off math that few functional persons have heard of, or do it with Matlab canned programs in the privacy of your home/school, and have the prospect of a life. My time on the mortal coil isn't long enough for this esoterica."
1,"Interesting Cover, but Bad CD","I can not believe that Ofra is even famous. Her playing is so stiff and lacks phrasing. Her tone quality is horrible. The only reason that she makes recordings is because her father is rich and he bought her a several million dollar cello and paid symphony orchestras to let her play solos with them. But, it is interesting to hear a cellist play the Beatles. Only buy this CD if you have boughten every cd on this webstite and have a little money left over."
5,Awesome,"I LOVE this band. They are new, fresh, totally original, and very good musicians. If you love Reggae, but want something a bit different, you have to give this band a listen to. Their first CD is excellent too."
3,A loving homage to 80's cheese!,"Indie film is alive and well, and as fun as ever. The effects are amusingly gross, the in jokes abound, and gifted horror author Kealan Patrick Burke makes an understated but impressive cinematic debut in a major role. This one needs a second viewing--the commentary track is a blast as director Greg Lamberson and his leading ladies fill us in on the behind the scenes chaos. Anyone who doesn't get the movie didn't get the 80's."
2,SHOULD BE ABOUT COLLECTING PENSION,"I was disappointed with this book. I think it was advertised wrong. I bought it because I am trying to get past due child support. Well if the father works ""under the table"" this book is not going to do you any good. You should only buy this book if you trying to collect child support from someone with a career."
1,Forearms crutch,"These crutches do not meet my needs at all. They only extend through the length of the crutch itself and there is no way to adjust the piece that grasps your arm. That piece does not come above the elbow, which means that it offers me very little stability. It can't be adjusted to fit your particular arm, either, so it is always ""loose."" It also does not flex at all.I contacted Amazon about returning the item. The promised that an agent of the seller would contact me with a return label and information. They never did. So I am stuck with the crutches and an expense I didn't need. I am highly disatisfied with the entire experience."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased these crutches because I didn't want to continue with armpit ones and I thought I would be ""zipping"" around on them. Wrong!. They are very hard on the hands and because the grips are plastic and not rubber as soon as you lean them against something they fall on the floor .......kind of difficult when bending to pick them up is a major task. I'm hoping to switch them for the type that wrap around your arm because these have not made life any easier at all."
3,Not so good,"The good - light, not as noisy as my other older forearm crutches.The bad - These cuffs are lousy. IMHO, as some one who spent a few months on crutches (BK leg amputee), the perk of forearm crutches is that when you are slid into a cuff they are atttached to your arm. You can then disregard them, use your hands to grab things, and generally not worry about them for a few minutes and not set them down. Very handy in a bathroom if you are a guy, also helps to move plates from counters to tables, whatever. These cuffs are open cuffs, you let them go, they fall down, you have to put them some place, and generally deal with them. No better than traditional crutches in this regard. And frankly this is a much bigger deal than lightweight benefits.The ugly - my doc wrote a prescription, my out of pocket was half of the amazon price, but my insurance company was billed nearly 3.5X the price on amazon. Sad."
2,Not for me,"After reading all of the great reviews on these crutches, I decided to purchase these euro crutches in gray and fetterman tornado tips(as recommended by another reviewer) to replace my hospital issued crutches. After testing these crutches out, I knew that these crutches were not going to work out. I could not stabilize these crutches because of the open forearm cuffs. I will say that they are very light. This setup(crutches and fetterman tips) are now for sale if anyone is interested for cheap."
3,Light and Quiet In The House,"I'm an LAK amputee and use forearm crutches for times and places where I do notwant to wear my prosthesis. Swimming, in the woods, on trails, around the house.I like the looks of these little crutches and they're very handy inside. So I prefer them in the house, where I used to just hop around before I got older.But, when I take them out for a mile walk, it is tiresome and they start making a clicking noise.Would not recommend them for amps."
5,Ideal,"These are ideal. I don't understand why hospitals in the USA still use the old type of crutches that Europe used during WWI! Is it to save money? These European crutches are really not expensive and they are light and sturdy, easy to use and don't hurt the shoulders."
3,Lightweight,"I didn't have much luck with these crutches. They are very light weight and look sporty, but I felt like they were unstable. They claim to support a weight of 250 lbs. I weigh about 230 and I wasn't comfortable using these for very long. They're probably ok if you're in the sub-200 lb range. I ended up using a set of heavy duty forearm crutches."
5,SOARING SONORITY,Ofra Harnoy's soaring sonority swoops on the calm wings of the cello. I always confuse her with Opra Winfrey. Maybe the bad review came from a rival cellist.
1,Don't bother with this one,"Unless you're a diehard Ofra Harnoy fan, this CD isn't for you. Harnoy performs Corelli, Mozart and Bruch in exactly the same style, with little consideration for the somewhat different playing practices employed by each composer. Obviously she is technically able to play all of these difficult pieces; but it's a varied selection, and Harnoy's playing shows little of the stylistically varied playing required by it. Her tone is consistently forced, almost pulling the double stops out of tune, as though fortissimo were an exercise in breaking soundposts. The organ adds little; one feels an orchestra might provide a more satisfying accompaniment. In summary, go listen to some Anner Bylsma for a refreshing change!"
5,"richter- ""florence""","having become a fan of richter's, i always snatch up anything of his that i can find. that said, when i saw this book at the store, i flipped through it, and decided to buy it instantly.as fans of richter's know, he is an avid photographer; not a professional, or artistic photographer, but rather, an avid snapshooter. this book has may of those snapshots of his from florence, italy, and cologne, germany. he then applied his trademark abstract painting over the photographs. all of the images in the book are representations of some of his 12cm x 12cm oil on photograph. the representations in the book are 13cm x 13cm in size.any fan of richter' sabstract pictures will be a fa ofthis book."
1,Sent the wrong drive,I ordered this drive and when it arrived it was an SATA drive. The item is still advertised as as an ATA-6.
4,More bigger! More better!,The Travelstar is a great upgrade route for older laptops that can eek out a bit more speed and responsivenes out of an older machine that requires more storage. Realiability is a hallmark of the Toshiba brand.
1,Two Failures In 6 Months,"I'm on my second replacement drive. There are comparable products for a similar price, buy those instead. If you're unlucky enough to already own one of these, make sure you back up often."
2,Increasing performance,Replacing old hard driver 40GB 5400RPM with this. it's speed increases than before. The noise is not lound like some one complaints about. If you don't need a larger space. It's good choice.
4,Not just for kids,"I didn't realize this was intended for children until I had brought it home, as the exterior cover does not so indicate. However, I did enjoy it and it increased my understanding of my own horse's behavior. Good for parents who want to introduce their children to scientific study and how a researcher can make definitive statements based upon uncovered facts. However, probably better for older children, 12 and up, unless they are already well-read and have a broad vocabulary.Darling Poor, the Horses Editor at BellaOnline"
3,THE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I am a keen aviation enthusiast and have read many flying stories. I have seen many flying movies, I own a plane and a pilots license. I was hoping for a little more action in the book. I liked the movie. The characters were interesting although the love plot was sappy. The book shows little of the fighter pilot excitement. Instead it focuses on Cleve's neuroses and the book moves slowly. I'm sure that this is a fair representation of the real air war experience but it is not much for entertainment."
4,The Hunters,"Really excdeptional ""Hemingwayesque"" novel. I only wish it was 100 pages longer so that more events and character development could have been included."
5,"Taut, spare and engrossing","I've never flown a fighter plane, nor did I fight in Korea but, thanks to James Salter, I have some sense of what each might have been like. There are few writers who combine literary excellence with the ability to tell a riveting adventure story. Salter is one of them and this book is superb."
4,Early Talent,"Although not as well done as my favorite, Solo Faces, The Hunters was Salter's first novel and showed his gift for succinct phrasing. Like Solo Faces this is a story of the melancholic aftermath of courage and irony."
5,Outstanding,"One of the best books by one of the century's best writers (wish he were more prolific). Veterans (I am one, though not a pilot) will understand it better than others, but you don't need to be a vet to love this book. Subtle and well written. His Burning the Days is great too"
2,What Is the Fuss About ?,"I was disappointed in this book, given the build up by reviwers, including a ""blurb"" in the New York Times Book Review. I happen to believe the Korean War is fascinating- more so than WW2 or even Vietnam. But the Korea story has been told elsewhere- and much better- by such writers as James Brady (""Coldest War"") Donald Knox (""Korean War"" in 2 parts esp. the first) and General Matthew Ridgeway (""Korean War""). Who would know the subject better than him? One could argue that those were concerned with the war on the ground. To that argument, I would offer James Michner's ""The Bridges at Toko-Ri"" about naval fighter pilots. I still can see that scene in the movie where Mickey Rooney drops in his chopper to rescue William Holden- and the book was better! A previous reviwer suggested getting this book at the library. As far as ""The Hunters"" is concerned, that is good advice. Readers should ""hunt"" for Korean War stories elsewhere."
1,Nossogood,"I really wanted to like this one. I've been following this series from the beginning and some of the books were quite fun but this one was difficult to get through (and it's not that long).My first issue was that the main troupe of characters is entirely made up of fighters. A human fighter, an elf fighter, a dwarf fighter, and a dwarf fighter cleric. Having Mialee or Lidda around usually helped the books... anything for a little more variety. Jozan the cleric makes a cameo in the beginning and returns and we know Naull will appear at some point... but when you get four fighters as the party you can be assured that there will be some hack and slash on its way.As to the fights... Lain writes a very interesing fight with folks feinting and ducking and blades nicking or pommels hammering... but there were a few too many of these just in the first few chapters. I'm still going to read the last book as I'm hoping this one just didn't come together."
2,Save Your Money,"Although an Anthony Newley fan, I am deeply disappointed in this CD. I can only suppose that most of the songs were recorded after a long illness. Age alone would hardly account for the weakness and deterioration of his voice. Only the first track, ""The Candy Man,"" sounds like Anthony Newley at his best. His other signature songs, ""Who Can I Turn To?"" and ""What Kind of Fool Am I?"" are rendered in a weak, quavery voice. How this CD could be titled, ""The Best of Anthony Newley"" is a mystery to me. Buy the CD soundtrack of ""Dr. Dolittle"" instead."
2,Some good songs but sad,"Mr Newley must have been ill when he did this CD as his voice is in very poor shape - and it is quite sad when he can barely get out his signature tunes. Some great old songs from his Broadway days and some nice autumnal, reflective new songs but his voice is just gone"
4,Great accompaniment to the study.,I ordered the DVD to accompany a ladies' bible study on the book by the same name. It was a tremendous help to see the author give his thoughts from his own perspective with such enthusiasm and conviction. The DVD was an added bonus to helping the flow of the study and the understanding of the book. The worship portion wasn't exactly what I cared for - I like more lively praise and worship. It seemed a little too simple and canned. That's why I gave it a four star review.
5,Rita Maxwell,"I have not watched the DVD, I am reading the devotional. I so enjoy reading the devotional, I read the Heaven last year loaned it and did not get it back so bought another one. I want to reread it. These are great books."
1,Not worth the money,This book was not worth the .75 that I paid for it. All of the info in here is very basic and things you can figure out on your own. Skip it.
5,Opening a new Universe,"Starting from a simple scene inside a shared bedroom, Laiseca goes completely wild to construct a whole new Universe. It's amazing, complex, at times contradictory, funny, gruesome, revulsive, intelligent, all at the same time. Oh, and it's really, really long. In spite of this, or maybe I should say because of this, I think this book is a masterpiece of modern literature."
4,gutsy readers,"That's what it takes. In case you never heard of him, Alberto Laiseca is one of Argentine finest writers, but you may prefer to begin to know him with another title (I suggest 'La hija de Keops', or 'Keops' daughter'). Los soria is really a big book, the size of a brick, that took many years to write and many many more (20, to be exact) to be published. If you are already familiar with Laiseca's universe, you will not be dissapointed, everything is here and in large quantities. Only true fans have been able to finish it, though, cause it has violence and disgressions, both in big quantities. If it's too much for you, go straight to a chapter called 'El Bayreuth de los crotos' (something like 'The Bayreuth of bums'), 100 pages long, almost a short novel on its own rights."
4,Can us product but was not what I originally wanted,I was looking for a XM radio that was truly portable. This one is not really that portable. You have to pretty much stay in the same place and sit there or stand there to use it as a portable xm radio. It is a portable MP3 player but I already hav eone of them.
4,Good value for the money,"A lot of people don't realize that this really does work as a stand-alone MP3 player. I have never had XM radio, and don't yet plan on paying for it, but I have the memory completely filled up with all my favorite songs and use it all the time. Very easy to figure out how to work all the options (I have yet to be able to figure out how to use my husband's ipod). One note - if you're not using it for XM radio don't bother with the installation disk. I have never used it - I just plug it into my computer through the USB where it becomes a new hard drive. Then I just copy and paste my songs to it's assigned hard drive letter. Tell the computer to safely remove that number, disconnect and your on your way.Now, I said good value for the money - I didn't pay anything for this, but i would say it is easily worth the equivalent 12 hour MP3 player."
2,Not Impressed,"It's okay, but I didn't like having to record songs for playback. I really wanted to be mobile and still have the live radio."
2,One thing to know before you buy......,You must have a window that faces south in order to receive a signal. I live in an apartment that has windows only facing north and east and I can not get a signal and therefore this product is worthless to me. So check to make sure you have access to a south window or somewhere to mount the antenna to face south that also is not blocked by trees or tall structures. Good Luck!
2,My experience,The ability to record music and use it as an MP3 player is not strong at all. I think it holds about 30 songs. The XM part seemed pretty bulky. The docking station is very big and the fact that there is no FM siginal from the device means it has to be plugged into an exsisting device for use in the car.
1,never got it,"I ordered a new radio unit after my old one died. When the shipment arrived though all the assessories were there (dock, cords, remote) but no radio unit. When I contacted customer service I was told that they wouldn't be able to fill it because of continually fluctuating inventory. So since I had no need for assessories to a radio I didn't posess, nor would posess, I returned what I had for the full refund. Didn't make up for wasted time not to mention a month's worth of wasted subscription though."
1,Nexus 25,"This is the second one we have had. The first one lasted quite sometime, but the second most recent one purchased from Amazon.com is broken already. Samsung says it is discontinued and cheaper to just buy a new one. So bought another 50.00 radio from XM Radio."
5,Great value for money in portable music,"Product takes 15 minutes to install (maybe half an hour more if you need to tweak the antenna angle and trim the trees to let it have a clear view of the sky). You can listen live, or the player stores 25 hours of music of your choice for playback later. You can preview the playlist by song title or artist, and delete any songs you don't want to hear. (If you buy the complete XM-Sirius subscription package, you also get all the talk radio channels.) It is extremely lightweight and comes with a clippy to hold it in place on your belt. I own two of these and I think they're great."
4,"good sockets, bad case",Porter Cable should take a lesson in cases from Ingersol Rand. I bought this set of SAE sockets and an Ingersol set of Metrices at the same time. Sets are similar in size and price but the P/C kit arrived with the CHEAP plastic case already broken. The Ingersol kit has a good blow molded case to keep your sockets handy for a long time.
4,Not quite what I needed but worth the price,"This is a very good and high quality product. I've seen complaints from others about the case but I think it's great.The only downside, for me, is that the socket walls are relatively thick and I cannot use the socket that I need on the custom wheels that are on my Ford truck - the lug nuts are deeply recessed and I have to use a 3/4 inch thin wall socket."
5,"Christian, Explore Your Jewish Roots","Get awakened to the history of Jewish-Christian relations. Learn to recognize and appreciate Jewish/Israeli contributions to the world and as the foundation of Christianity. Grow in your understanding of how to relate to Jews in your locale and worldwide. This book will not make you an expert on Jews or their history, but it is well laid out, covers several important aspects of Judaism that Western Christians should be familiar with, and encourages us to engage both the world and the Jew. In general, a very positive book, and a great contribution to the discussion taking place between Jews and Christians. I recommend it to either one. As is to be expected, the book does mention and discuss the Holocaust, but not as a major point."
2,Tinkle tinkle little star,"Very precise, lightweight, but tasteful Mozart, this. Never goes above mF and very little phrasing or shading. Listen to Perahia to see just how elastic Mozart can be without destroying the line. If you like delicacy in these works, this is a safe bet. But surely Mozart would have wanted more force and contrast!"
4,****1/2. One of their best and most consistent,"This is the Faces' tightest album, filled with rough, tough three-minute rock n' roll songs. The arrangements are the best you'll find on any Faces record, and the songs are more varied than usual in mood and tempo, spanning ballads, hard rock, piano-driven boogie rock, and acoustic folk-rock.Ian McLagan plays wonderful boogie piano on the swaggering rockers ""My Fault"" and ""Borstal Boys"", and Ron Wood's muscular guitar playing on the mid-tempo groove of the classic ""Cindy Incidentally"" and the good-time barroom boogie of ""Silicone Grown"" is some of his best and most focused playing on record.And even the lesser-known songs are excellent, like the superbly melodic ""Just Another Honky"" and the acoustic title track.This collection of songs is the best you'll find on any Faces album (well, alongside ""A Nod Is As Good As A Wink...""), and ""Ooh La La"" is a must-have for Faces fans, hardcore and casual alike.4 1/2 stars - highly recommended."
1,A lost cause; Buy this CD and pay with your soul!,The bland harmonys and boring lyrics bring this CD to the top of my most regreted purchases. Rethink this CD and you'll go insane. This music just about broke my 'Face.' Believe me all...one good song does not an album make.
5,Extraordinary! No Album Gets Worship Better,"Facedown is exceptional. Matt Redman has a deep understanding of biblical worship, which pervades every song on this album. This, when combined with his musical creativity, makes for an astounding success. I highly recommend this album to all. It will help you worship more deeply and truly, and, in the process, grow into a more solid understanding of biblical worship. (For more detail, see my review in Worship Leader magazine, July/Aug 2004 issue, and my in-depth review on my website, www.markdroberts.com, ""The Soul of Worship"")."
4,The only sunscreen,The only sunscreen that doesn't make my son have a subsequent rash. Expensive but worth it if you don't want to burn and have sensitive skin.
2,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with the way that this router table goes together. It was not easy or short, and it seems like they cut some corners in the manufacturing process. But this is not by biggest complaint. My biggest tiff with the table is that the fence and guide SUCKS... It is not easy to adjust or square or easy to square. I finally gave up and made my own fence because there is no upgrade fence available for this table. Everyone knows that the accuracy of a router table comes in the stability of the router mounts and a good fence. The fence on this model is trash and I would not recommend it for the money that I paid for it. Grizzly was no help when contacting them and didn't seem to ""understand"" my problem...lol"
4,Outstanding,"Best router table setup out there for the money. I have made countless cabinet doors on this table with very little complaints. Just be prepared to throw the stock fence away and build your own. Also the table lift feature is not the best. It is easier just to drop the router out of the bottom to switch bits. Those are the only gripes, really i would recommend this router table to anyone."
2,So So,"When I clamped the stock needing routing, the stock tended to be forced out of square with the fence (i.e., when I moved the stock through the routing process). The stock seemed to get held up by the stationary part of the table. I tried several different tensions on the clamp, but, none of them worked out this issue. The fence was not supported close enough to the router bit. This causes the fences to flex when any pressure is applied close to the router bit. I have found the less expensive router tables to do a better job with far less weight and price."
1,Falls Short,"This table has the potential to be a great table but it falls short on two huge features. The router mount mechanism is bad a best. Sure it allows for infinite adjustability and you can mount any router in the world but it takes lots of fidgeting to install it properly. This is also the least of its major drawbacks.The table top is too thick. I used a Triton 2 hp router with this table. First of all this router allows for above table height adjustment which you can't do with this table. Shame on me for not realizing there would be no work around for this. The top is also so thick that I cannot get enough extension out of my router to use some bits to their fullest. I tried my Hitachi and Ryobi router also and same problem. Very bad design indeed.I have to also agree with a previous review, the top is dangerous! It's hard to lock in place, very heavy and if by chance you were to close it on a finger.... Bye bye finger..."
3,Omega 3....watch expiration date,"i am not sure if it works for my dog but it does add the favor to the dry food, which is good.It seems that the fur get little bit more and shine.However, i stop feeding it for a while and until recently i start to feed my dog those and he start having diarrhea and puking few hours after feeding. there must be something wrong with it but it was fine before and i starting looking for expiration date. which i couldn't see it or it's not clearly indicated."
1,Clip can cut skin,I have never been cut by a pen before now. The top of clip is sharp edge. I somehow caught by thumb on it and it drew blood. Pens should not cut with ordinary use. The clip is a pain to deal with anyway. I doesn't just slide over your shirt pocket like most other pens -- you have to squeeze the top hard to open the clip-- it's a bother. The pen feels somewhat heavy. It write fine.
1,There are better choices,Actually the CD is quite humorous. It doesn't prepare you for anything and lacks structure. You could go on YouTube and find more useful material and more comical stuff. Don't buy the CD. You'll be greatly disappointed. The CD is a collection of witnesses giving bad testimony and nothing more.
1,a waste,"uhhh NO ,,,,dont get this.... get their best of CD. thats all you need ... oh....and get Fugazi 'margin walker' and '12 songs'.... and download the song 'public witness program' (only the song, i hated the rest of the CD personally)"
3,Just Okay,"First, I love the Chef'n products, especially their spoon-spatula thingy, but I'm kind of disappointed with these tongs. The tongs are a little tricky to keep closed, and they're just kind of, well, awkward to use. I think that's because they're too big on the top. These sit in my drawer. I only use them if my Oxo tongs are dirty. I definitely recommend the Oxo tongs over these."
1,Mislead,Unfortunately I have been spoilt by seeing the four part miniseries french with english subtitles of Les Miserables and that is what I thought I was ordering. Instead I received a shortened film version. The miniseries was fantastic and gave far more depth to the characters and understanding of the relationships between the characters. I was very disappointed to have received the same film that I had already bought previously especially with shipping And handling costs as well! If anyone can shed some light on how I can purchase the four part miniseries I would be very grateful.
1,dry and useless,"Sorry. Stick this version back in the box. With all the time they had to explore Hugo's fabulous story, they managed only a shallow expression of the characters. Accents were all over the place and some of the scenes seemed quite unrehearsed or even unwritten with actors throwing in quaint idioms from mid-20th century."
4,LES MIS (in English unfortunately),"Enjoyed the movie but with so many French actors trying to speak in English,found it a bit annoying . Even John Malkovich is a fluent French speaker."
2,Disappointing,"Although I've read and enjoyed the other mysteries in this series, I felt that this was a departure from the underlying theme of the series, namely a mother and her interactions with her family as she goes about trying to solve mysteries. In this story, Lucy was preoccupied with herself, and her family took a backseat as she tried to discover a murderer and contemplated an affair; a not-so-believable twist in the plot. The reader gets a confusing view of Lucy's husband: on the one hand, he's a traditionalist who wants his wife at home; on the other, he'd like her to do what she wants. In the other books, one gets a sense that this is a good marriage. In this book, one wonders what these two have in common. The murder story even took a back seat to Lucy's preoccupation with herself. Was this a muder mystery or a woman's struggle with mid-life crisis? In the end, the resolution is anticlimactic, and the reader is left with some negative thoughts toward Lucy Stone."
3,It's alright for Starters.,"Well i enojy bass so listen to musci at higher volumes so i can hear mids and highs as well. And at lower and mid volumes it sounds good but it distorts at higher volumes.So if you really into car audio and enojy your Bass, looks for smthing with higher RMS and stonrger midbass."
4,classic music,This cd is a wonderful and fun piece to listen to over and over. They are familiar pieces from the various music artists of the past. Good one for any auto trip.
2,"Not an exciting collection and in no way ""Extreme""","Despite the humorous cover art and the exciting notion of ""Extreme"" orchestral classics, this collection does not live up to its potential. The sound quality is lacking, as it is with all of the RCA Victor classical recordings I have heard, and the track selections are not really all that compelling. I recommend a pass on this one."
5,Good Read,"Wonderful insights into the workings of the Eastern academic establishment in the 20th century. Superbly-written - an easy, smooth read. Perhaps of particular interest to this reader, a former student of Mr. Blum's, his book should also have appeal to anyone interested in an academic life."
5,Most practical book I've read on ASIC's,The author has done a good job in explaining all the intricate details of synthesizing ASIC's in deep sub-micron realms. I would recommend this to every ASIC design engineer.
1,Advanced Asic Chip Synthesis: Using Synopsys Design Compiler,This book offers nothing extra from Synopsys On-Line Documentation. It is simply over overpriced.
1,very general; very short; not worth the money,"This book is extremely general. Even for readers who do not want to practice synthesis or timing analysis. It gives very few minor examples. It is not worth the money. I finished reading the book in 1 day. The information in this book is so shallow. I wasted my money. If you have access to the synopsys tools, it is much better to read the tools user guide."
1,"Highly overpriced, bad English, poor typeset","I got turned off from this book the moment I opened it, and before I even read a single line. It has huge font size (even larger, instead of smaller, for example scripts) and one-inch margins on top and bottom. (An O'Reilly book has 40% more information on same-sized page, and it's far easier to read.) Every other sentence contains a punctuation error. All this makes it hard to concentrate on the content.The content itself is good for the absolute beginner, but not much else. The example scripts have no useful comments. Several important concepts (wire-load models among them) are mentioned without explanation. Other concepts (such as false paths) are explained in a misleading way.The author may be a superb designer, but that does not automatically make him a decent writer.Also, shouldn't editors have caught the English language errors?"
4,"brief and pratical, good one for real world ...","In the real design world, experiences talked. This book came out with experiences, the whole book is fluent with design experiences and briefly explain the necessary conecpts to use the tools in the real design world. It is organized in a quite elegant way, and really helpful. However, I still wish there are more theoretical explanations behind the scenes, but that might need another books to aim at different purposes."
3,Cattle call for recipes.,"Seems like the authors just did a cattle call for crock recipes. There are lots of recipes and most look fairly simple, which is good. I'm not sure if anyone tested them though. Also there seems to be many recipes that are listed with only a slight variation as a whole new recipe. All in all a good book (not great) and their are some unique recipes that I haven't seen elsewhere."
2,"Dirty, pages bent over - really used!",As above. I will use it but have to sanitize it first. Only bad experience I've had in the past 25+ years.
2,"Same old, same old....","I love my crock pot, and I try to use it as much as possible because it makes cooking for a busy family much easier. With that in mind, I thought this cookbook would give me more ideas for meals. Well, I was wrong. Almost all the recipes are the same, except for personal additions that vary from recipe from recipe. Beef stew is beef stew, regardless of how you make it. If you're looking for a variety, don't buy this book."
2,Redundant,"There are lots of lovely recipes in this book, and I'm sure all the contributors are proud of their offerings. However, many are just repetitions. Who needs 11 recipes for apple butter, for instance? It appears to be a thick book, but in reality, it could be a third thinner with no discernable loss in content or quality. It is tedious, to say the least. On the plus side, the spiral binding makes it quite user-friendly, allowing it to lie flat, and remain open."
3,"Lot's of recipes, but not well indexed","and most are sort of repetitive (i.e., 12 beef stew recipes, 13 lasagna recipes, etc.).There are some gems in the book, that I have flagged for re-use. But some of the recipes are, quite frankly, not very good. Also, you can't look up the recipes by food type (like chicken, pork, etc.). The index is only by recipe title, which isn't very useful."
2,Not Really Great,"I don't like this book. There are only a few recipes that I would use. What I don't like is that there are many duplicates of recipes with only small variations - they are basically the same. Also, there are lots of beef recipes - which is OK if that is what you want."
5,what's not to like here?,This is the handiest book! I've loaned it to a neighbor for a recipe she tasted and by the time I got it back she had ordered her own copy. Home recipes are great.
2,500 Variations on Beef Stew and some other recipes....,"Mostly tiny variations on the same recipe over and over. Out of 800+ recipes, I can count on one hand the ones we'd actually try. I'd rather search for crockpot recipes online that have pictures, reviews and healthier ingredients!"
2,Too much repetition!,"I am a disappointed buyer. The back cover boasts more than 800 recipes, but there are a huge number of very similar recipes: more than a dozen versions of beef stew, eight similar versions of ham and potatoes, eight meatloafs, seven Mexican cheese dips using Velveeta cheese. The authors would do better to present a lot fewer recipes that have been screened for the ""cream of the crop."""
1,Very Disappointing,"This is a terrible cookbook, in my opinion. If I had seen it in a store I never would have bought it, and I feel misled by the many rave reviews here. It wasn't written by the ""authors"", but is a collection of recipes from amateur cooks of the sort who rely heavily on canned soups and processed cheese. (Ugh!) Also there are many recipes which are essentially duplicates of others. Lora Brody's book is good, but I was looking for something with more, but still good, recipes. This isn't it."
3,Help for the busy family,"Before having kids my husband and I loved to cook. Now, with two kids, we barely have time to eat. Along comes this cookbook and we are once again on the road to hot meals.I really like the fact that this book has so many recipes, but I'm going to agree with others that many of them are very similar. There are plenty of stews and soups which I like but beef stew seems to be on every page. Also, don't expect anything more than comfort foods--nothing gourmet here.All in all this is a good book. I bought it for much less than it is priced here, so if you can buy it used you may be happier with your investment."
5,Delicious,I have used this cookbook exclusively for the last 4 months and I love it! I just had a baby and was looking for a cookbook that would make delicious and easy meals. I no longer need to wonder if any of the meals will taste good since they all do. And my husband can not believe how well he is eating since we have our little 4 month old!
2,NOT SO PLEASED,This is not the first Fix It and Forget It cookbook that I have bought. The binding was on the wrong side. But this one I bought as a gift and did not have the time to exchange it. Imbarassing..it looked like a seconds gift. How was this overlooked when packed?
5,NOW IT'S SO EASY,"I went from being a single mom with one child to a pastor's wife and mother of four - I had a lot to learn about time management and low budget cooking. This book is a lifesaver. I have several stand-by recipes now that I regularly use for church pot-lucks. My personal favorite is the Macaroni & Cheese - REALLY! It's just like my mom used to make, but no fuss. (A note here: my family prefers ziti noodles to macaroni.) There is also a flank steak recipe that is the best - with only 4 ingredients. How easy is that? Get this book and have one less stress in your life!"
2,Forget it...not enough variety,"I found this book on a bargain table, quickly glanced through it, and purchased it. Dumb-da-dumb-dumb.This was a bad purchase. I wasted my money. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. So many others have written about the problems...I whole-heartedly agree with their reviews.I gave it two stars (instead of one) because I do occasionally look through this book for ideas. I've only used three or four recipes out of it, and those haven't become family favorites or anything.My suggestion, save your money."
2,Ho-Hum....Much of the same over and over...,"Not all that impressed, a lot of recipes that were very similar and many different takes on the same recipe (there must be 25+ different recipes for ""stew"" that are almost alike). The book contains recipes submitted by people rather than ""professional"" recipes. Reminded me of a school fundraiser cookbook with parent submitted recipes. Tried a bunch of different recipes from it, none were worthy of making again. Doing a search on the internet for ""Slow Cooker Recipes"" yielded better results for me."
1,The art of tastelessness,"I have tried about 20 recipes from this book and I have to say that are only about 2 that I would make again. I've never eaten anything as tasteless as Mom's spaghetti sauce (no offense to Mom). You can tell that she worked hard to concoct the perfect combination of spices to cancel each other out. Aside from that, who needs 50 different recipes for beef stew? Was the book written by chickens? I would definately consider other books."
2,Quantity? Yes. Variety? No.,"I picked this book up in the bookstore because it sounded like just what I was looking for -- simple. What I discovered is that the recipes are definitely simple, but they're also incredibly repetitive. Sure, I can appreciate a dozen variations in swiss steak, but I'm not sure that counts as a dozen recipes. I flipped through most of the main dish section without finding more than a couple things I even wanted to try.I think this is a great cookbook if you're looking for flavor variations on slow cooker classics. If you're looking for recipes that are both simple and interesting, I'd look elsewhere."
2,very dissapointing,"I bought this book because it was all the rage a year or two ago. I was new to slow cooking and thought this would help me figure it out. The problem was that I'm not a meat and potatoes or canned food kind of person. I don't keep that stuff on hand and prefer fresh cooked meals.Another problem was the repetitive nature of it. Not only do I not care to cook a lot of the recipes, but there are about ten different versions of each boring recipe. I hope I can find a book to tell me how to adapt my own recipes to the slow cooker."
3,It was okay,This was an ok cook book. I just thought it woudl be different than others but very much the same. Not bad at all just not up to what I expected
5,"Filled with easy, and family friendly recipes!","The best Slow Cooker cookbook ever! It is not filled with a lot of strange recipes you would never use. Instead it has meals you make every day, only easy! You will find tried and true recipes that a compiled from friends, family, and neighbors coming from all over the USA. This is a must have cookbook for the busy person who needs to come home to a great cooked meal, after working all day."
1,Looks can be decieving,"Say you want a recipe for slow cooked pulled chicken. There MIGHT be 4 or 5 in the book, but since the recipes are clearly listed under regular people's names and NOT the dish, you may never find a pulled chicken dish in the book. NOTHING in the index is under a normal title such as ""Pulled chicken."" I'm sure Lily's Vegetable Beef Soup is just as good as Ruby's, but how the heck would I find the recipe by their FIRST NAME??? Stupid idea to write a cook book this way...Its a shame. I would HIGHLY recommend looking elsewhere for slow-cooker recipes as all this book does is frustrate you."
5,Favorite Cookbook,"Two things: I love crockpots and I love this cookbook. It is by far my favorite cookbook. Not only is the cookbook filled with recipes, but there are many for one type of recipe. Want to make chili? Compare six or seven of the chili recipes to make just the right chili for you. The options are a wonderful bonus, but I also find that the book contains recipes for any type of meal that you might want to make in a crockpot. There are chili, potato soup, beef stew, pot roast, chicken cacciatore, lasagna recipes, etc. to choose from. I have tried tons of the recipes and most have turned out perfect and delicious. However, if you prefer light meals this is not the cookbook for you. These recipes are for those of us that love home cooking."
3,Wish there wee photos!!,"This book has tons of slow cooker recipes in it. Some of them are almost the same, with just a few different ingredients that are different and are named different.I have made 3 of the dishes so far and they were easy to make and tasted great.I plan on making a lot of the recipes in the book so I would recommend it to anyone.My only problem is there are not photos showing the food. I really need photos."
2,Don't bother buying this cookbook,"The recipes in this book are a collection of other people's home recipes, most our boring and use can goods. Nothing exciting or different here. There are no nice presentations or pictures of what you might be eating. Save yourself time and money and get a ""real cookbook."""
2,Not for the health-conscious!,"Although most of these recipes are quick and some are tasty (others are ordinary at best), many are far from healthful and in that way not much better than fast food. Many rely on cream soups, bottled dressings, and sour cream for flavor. Also, some of the soups in the ""Vegetarian Soup"" section contain chicken broth, beef broth, bacon, or dried beef. Someone needs to check the definition of ""vegetarian""!"
1,I was so disappointed!,"I had heard great reviews for this ""cookbook"" from several slow-cooker e-lists. I just received the book in yesterday's mail, and I was so disappointed! It isn't a cookbook, it's just a collection of recipes from people other than the ""authors."" I'll bet most of them weren't even tested. There is nothing about technique. And the recipes are repetitious--there is a large section on soups and stews (mostly chili and beef stew), and then a good number of the recipes in the main dish section are also stews. As mentioned in other reviews, a very large percentage of the recipes call for canned cream soup. There are 600 recipes, but as I looked through the book, I saw only one or two that interested me."
3,"Well-organized book, but simple recipes are often repeated","Crock pot cooking is simple, and this cookbook follows that guideline. I like how the book is organized, and the pages are fun and easy-to-read. However, I was a bit disappointed at how many recipes were repeated. There are SO MANY recipes for pot roast, chili, beans, etc., and all of these recipes are incredibly similar. There are a few worthwhile recipes that I use over and over; however, there are better crock pot cookbooks out there. In addition, if you're looking for healthy foods or vegetarian-friendly recipes, skip this one. However, if you just need some quick, easy-to-use crock pot recipes, and don't mind wading through the duplicates, this one may be for you."
2,Compilation of recipes without screening,"I felt that this cookbook culled the internet for all kinds of recipes and just threw them together without testing. Lots of them are the same recipes with one or two things different, and the quality of the end product was all over the place for me. I love my slow cooker, but i want to do more with it than just open several cans and dump them in. I prefer Rick Rodger's book - everything i have made from that book has been fantastic!"
1,What a disappointment,"I first saw this book at an aquarium gift shop in Oregon (yes, its true). I decided to check it out from the library before purchasing. I am glad I did! The continued repetition of the same recipe is boring. Most recipes used processed, high fat and sodium foods (velveeta being a favorite). My favorite recipe??? ""Perfection Hot Dogs"". ""Place hot dogs in slow cooker. Cover and cook for 1-2 hours."""
3,Simple but way too bland/boring,"Since over 100 people have posted reviews I won't dissect it. However, I'd like to say my family did not like the recipes in this book. We are used to fairly spicy, complex flavors and while the recipes were nutritious and easy, we just picked at them because they were too bland for our tastes.My Mother-in-law gave me this book because she loves it. Which is not surprising because she likes her food bland and not challenging. Undoubtedly some families will like the recipes but I'll give my copy away."
4,Practical and good,"More meat recipes than I will ever use, but plenty of good basic recipes. Didn't know my slow cooker could make all that tasty comfort food."
4,Great Recipies,"Great recipies and very easy to follow. Whether you've been cooking for years or this is your first time, you will have no problem following the easy steps to delicious meals."
5,Fix It/Forget It Cookbook,"Item received in excellent condition - like new, as promised. I have the same cookbook with a plastic comb binder so it'll lay flat - that's the only thing I'd change about the book, but knew it was paperback-bound, so am not disappointed. Purchased as a gift, and couldn't be more pleased!"
5,Delighted,Love my books they are everything I expected and more. I was especially excited that I had received them so much earlier than expected. Thankyou.
4,review for Fix it and Forget it,Fix it and Forget it is the perfect slow cooker recipe book. My ex-husband uses it every week and was thrilled when I bought it for his birthday. He is diabetic and makes himself healthy easy soups and stews once or twice a week.Elma Kenefsky
4,Should be in every kitchen.,What more can you say about a cookbook that's sold 5 million copies. A must more everyone with a slow cooker.
5,Fix It and Forget It,"I am new at using a slow cooker, and this book really helped me. Lots of recipes and I've tried many of them already."
5,Wonderful Cookbook,I purchased this book used but it was in very good condition.The book has wonderful crock pot recipes which are very easy to prepare. Love it!!!
5,Fix it and Forget it,"Love this Crock Pot Cookbook, I buy it for all my friends and family. User Friendly...."
1,Boring,"I agree with the ones who say lots of repeating the same recipe. I had high hopes, but, was unfortunately disappointed. I'm not one to return a cookbook, but this is going back! sorry"
1,Bland & Bad for you,I've given this book 100% effort in trying to find a keeper recipe - have tried over 20 recipes to date and found one (Taco Soup) - the rest were definitely not keepers. A good chunk of the ones I haven't tried were over the top bad-for-you or sounded down right icky (and I'm fairly adventerous when it comes to trying recipes). I agree with the other reviewers - lots and lots of duplicate recipes where one or two ingredients were changed. Lots of canned soups and processed cheese. There's got to be a better book out there - if not - someone please write one! With healthy yummy recipes! The crockpot is so handy - I'd like to think I can make great food in it that doesn't cause my arteries to dial 911.
1,Fix It and Dump It!!!,Quite a disappointment. Received this as a gift last Christmas and after trying over a dozen recipes I'm convinced of the following: 1) the book is the worst 2) recipes not taste tested and 3) not worth the time to make any of this recipes.I've had to dump most of the food after cooking. Save your money and buy another crockpot cookbook!!
1,I'd rather eat real food,"Like another reviewer, I was extremely disappointed with the number of recipes in this book that called for canned soup of some sort. Many of these recipes are about throwing some already processed ingredients into the pot, which feels more like serving pre-prepared food and heating it up.There are fewer than a dozen recipes in the entire book that I would even bother making.Just flipping through the recipes reminded me of being stuck in the house on a freezing cold January night with nothing to look forward to except dinner, and having to eat something nasty that involved condensed cream of mushroom soup.Very disappointing. I received this as a gift, otherwise I would have returned it."
2,Not so great,"Recipes are kind of yucky (maybe just not to our taste, though) but easy. Not a very wide variety, but eg. many many (too many) recipes for meatballs etc -- but not a wide variety of foods. Some things I made according to instructions seemed a little overcooked."
2,Disappointed,"too many of the same recipe for one meal..one recipe works best for me..if you like looking over many recipes for the same meal, then deciding which one..this is the book for you, personally I was disappointed because there are too many options and the recipes are a collection from manycooks, not the author(s)of the book. No pictures for visual people.would not recommend."
5,Best slow-cooker cookbook ever!,"This is the most-used cookbook I own. I cook in my slow cooker at least 2-3 times a week now, and, with a family of 5, I still have enough left over to freeze for an evening when it's just me and the kids. None of the recipes have wacky ingredients, and most can be easily modified for what you have on hand. The book is divided into similar recipes: all the chili recipes are together, all the pork chop recipes are together etc., so you can just look through a section until you find the recipe that matches closest to what's in your cupboards. My most amazing discovery...you don't have to brown hamburger before you layer ingredients in your cooker! This saves on pots and pans to wash. There are sections for drinks, breakfasts, sides, mains dishes and desserts Did I mention I love this cookbook?"
4,Help for the brain dead cook,"This book reminds me that cooking can be easy if I allow it to be. When I am stressed out, but must produce a meal, this is where I turn. I am bound to find some combination that I can throw into my dear crockpot when I leave for work and enjoy heartily when I return home.The crockpot allows for flavors to mingle, so classic stew combinations abound. Although the book multiplies its recipes by making small variations from one recipe to the next, that helps me (in a brain-dead state) to select one. Before I cook, I usually compare various recipes to pick the best for my purpose or preference. The results from this book have been tasty. My husband and I especially liked the enchilada beef recipe.Not only do I use this cookbook, but I gave a copy to my step-son, who needs simple recipes for survival.Guess what, you don't have to be a gourmet cook all the time!"
3,Just Average,"I tried a few recipes from this cookbook and had to wonder if the recipes were tested at all. The first one I tried, I couldn't get all the ingredients to fit in my 5-quart cooker. The second one I tried supposedly served 8, but it was too small of a recipe for my cooker and it burned. The recipes I tried didn't have much flavor, because there were no herbs or spices listed in the ingredients. I would have liked to have seen recipes with more flavor, less reliance on canned soups, and suggestions on what size cooker to use for each recipe."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,"I love my crock pot and I love any recipe books that can help me make creative and delicious meal in my crock pot. This book is one of the best crock pot recipe books I've come across. As an avid cookbook collector, this is one that gets used the majority of the time.My husband makes fun of my crock pot cooking, but was bitten by the bug when he tried a pumpkin pie pudding recipe from this book. He even tried a chocolate pudding cake recipe, and while that didn't 'hook' him...he stopped getting on me about our easy, one pot meals.Sometimes, I just sit and look through all the recipes and plan meals from the book. I don't know what I want to make ahead of time, I let the book 'speak' to me.It may take a while, but I eventually plan to make every recipe in it."
1,Recipes are not tested - Buyer Beware!,"The first 2 recipes I tried turned out terrible. The first was on page 83, Irish Beef Stew. Everything was tender but absolutely no taste. There should be more salt & pepper or something? I didn't give up, since there are so many recipes in this book. My next try was Meatloaf Dinner on page 107. I followed the recipe to a ""T"". When I arrived home in anticipation of a great smell of ""dinner ready"" I was instead greated with the smell of burnt potatoes and carrots! Yuk! After inspecting the Crock Pot and seeing the black and burnt potatoes and carrots, I re-read the recipe, thinking I did something wrong (like forget to add water or broth ??) I believe there should have been some liquid added to this recipe, but none was to be found written in the book. I give up. I'm not even giving this book away, I'm throwing it away! What a waste of food! I can't stand it!"
5,A Must Have!,"This cookbook contains easy, practical, and tasty recipes to make a busy life easier and allows for more time outside of the kitchen!"
2,Just a group of apparent prise winning recipes,"I received this as a gift thinking when I requested it that it would be good given the author. Rather than an author, Goodman is an editor of a group of recipes from some county fairs or such as each recipe is attributed to one or more from a small group of towns. While I don't doubt they are good, there is no nutritional information and no guidance on how to use the slow cooker. This book is for experienced cooks or at least experienced with slow cookers"
1,"A previous reviewer said it right, ""forget it""","This is a collection of recipes from amateurs, and I have rarely seen one so completely uninspiring. Many recipes seem bland and use very little imagination. I don't mind the lack of pictures, but I have a problem with the brief descriptions - could they not have included fewer recipes (many of which are almost identical) and more tricks, tips, or a brief description of alternate ingredients. I don't know who eats like this, but most of it is disturbingly reminiscent of public school ""cafeteria slop"". I have no idea why it was on the NYT bestseller list, and I'm glad it was given as a gift, because I can't see spending money on this book."
5,Fix it and Forget It,"Great cookbook, every receipe that I have tried is very good and most of them are very easy to fix."
4,Fix It and Forget It Cookbook,"My daughter frequently uses this cookbook. She is the busy mother of four and homeschools all four so her time is very taken up every day. The meals are healthy,flavorful.I purchased a copy for myself and one for my daughter-in-law. We are also enjoying the convenience of fixing meals ahead to enjoy later."
2,"Beware ""purists""!","If you like to make things from scratch, so you know what exactly it is you're eating, then this book is not for you. To be fair, I've never actually used it, but page after page of recipes in which cans/packets of soup, etc, were central to the dish put me right off. If that's the kind of recipe you're looking for, then you probably couldn't do better."
2,disapointed!,"I was disapointed when I got this book. Yes, it does have lots of recipes but I found it wasn't quite what I was looking for. Most of the bean recipes called for canned beans when I have found the slow cooker to be the best way to cook dried beans. I couldn't see the point of throwing a few different cans of beans together and leaving them in the slow cooker for hours. Alot of the other recipes called for canned soups and canned vegetables. There is so much more that can be done with a slow cooker other than using canned food stuffs. The recipes in this book were obviously meant for a variety of sizes of crockpots but nowhere in this book did it state what sizes they used. I found this book a little boring and unimaginative."
2,Repetitive and disappointing,"I'm glad I found this at the library rather than spend money on it. As others have noted - there is an incredible amount of repetition (e.g. 10 recipes for apple butter). I tagged maybe four recipes, but frankly I stopped seriously looking after seeing pages and pages and pages of the same dish. I'll stick with ""Better Homes and Gardens"" slow-cooker books."
2,For novice cooks and crowds...,"A lot of repeat recipes; for example, beef stroganoff, chili, bean dips, etc., and usually only one or two ingredients different for each recipe. Useful if you don't know how to cook or are a ""new"" cook--like for high-school or college students--or for cooking a casual meal for a crowd for Sunday afternoon football. For more advanced cooks, it's way too basic. Recipes are very high fat as well...processed cheese is a favorite ingredient!"
3,Not five stars but worth what I wanted it for,I do agree about the unhealthy mixing of fatty foods. However I didn't read anywhere that this book claimed to be a low fat cookbook either. If you choose to use ground turkey insted of the ground beef. You could Have a lower fat meal.I also used lower fat cheeses.This is what I did with several of the recipes I made.They came out great.I liked Reading to see how many different ways one recipe was made. I now have several ways to use and add in new ingredents to old recipes. I already have. I got exactly what I was expecting. To get new and updated recipes. I would give as a gift and have already done so.
1,Too many of the same recipe,"I bought this book in January, it is going into our yard sale this month. I got very frustrated because there were pages of the same recipe with different names. The index was arranged by the name of the recipe-ie-Sue's stew, Sue's potroast, Sue's chicken soup, ect. not by ingredients. I have found other Crock Pot books that are wonderful so am getting rid of this one."
2,Has a couple of good recipes,"I had high hopes for this cookbook. I've made a few recipes but nothing was that incredible or worth making again for that matter. I love to buy cookbooks, but with the ability to get recipes online at allrecipe.com I really don't use my cookbooks anymore. It's easier to search a database and read reviews to find what I'm looking for. I still have my books, because sometimes its just fun to dig through them for a new recipe, but I just don't have the time these days. Going online is easier."
3,Too much sodium,I am somewhat disappointed in the over-use of sodium-laden processed foods in many of these recipes.
5,LOVE This Book!,I love this book! I use it all the time. The recipes are delicious and easily adaptable to your own liking. I have yet to find anything that I did not like in this book. Would recommend to everyone who loves cooking in the crock pot and for those that want simple and delicious meals!
1,Fix it and forget it,"I purchased this book hoping to find a collection of reliable slow cooker recipes. However, I found that the book was first of all boring and uninteresting in its appearance. The recipes were stuffed 6 to a double page with no author comments or tips and no colored pictures or illustrations. Not very reader friendly. Furthermore, the recipes relied heavily on cream or dried soups, and some of the recipes bordered on silly, certainly they were inane. In short, I did not care for the book at all, and will donate it."
4,Fix it and Forget it,"Great book and recipes. Once you get into the habit of using the slow cooker, you are hooked. So cool to come home and have the meal prepared and the smell of fixens all done."
5,So entertaining,This book is such an entertaining read. Anyone who loves Batman should get it. It will tell you everything you need to know on how to be Batman.
4,Great for any Batman aficionado.,Excellent in terms of the thoroughness of the research and details of the caped crusader's equipment and methods. I would recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of Batman.
4,Tongue and cheek how -to for the Batman fans,"First off I have to say I am the ultimate Batman fan, even have a batman tattoo. This book is very similar to those survival guides and how-to books. And as I read this I wound myself laughing out loud. It is written to the effect that you could do these things and afford to do them. i.e. go train with ninjas. Not only was I laughing at the book but also laughing at myself. Even if you don't a have batman tattoo you will still enjoy it if you like other superheroes."
3,Batman Handbook,"Still have not finished this book yet, book cover is definitely attractive. It opens up the secret to Batman's technology and techniques in a practical sense. Recommended for all Batman fans and not to mention people who seeks to apply heroic knowledge in life."
5,A state of art documentary and a true story,"The ""Russian Front"" is a state of art documentary, really reflecting what was going on the Russian Front for the period 1941-1945. For the very first time after Cold War, we're finally able to see the truth about the Russian Front. This documentary is A++ . Highly recommended."
3,Review of Boob Tube DVD,This is a documentary i wish there were more footage of the women being shown getting naked & less interviews. Some of the N.Y. background history was interesting. If your looking for a lot of women getting naked you will be very unhappy at the small amount footage that is really in it but for a low Amazon price its worth a look the main deptartment stores wont carry this so mail order is the main option.
4,"Concise, Great Graphics, Maybe a Little Too Definitive","THE ALAMO 1836 upholds the fine tradition of the Osprey series. The slim soft-cover contains the events before, during, and after the siege of the Alamo. Within is a nice assortment of photographs, maps, and 3-D graphics. After reading this book -- and the Osprey books are quick reading -- I felt as if I had read a much thicker volume on the subject. This is definitely a resource for someone interested in reading about the Lone Star State's war of independence in overview format.Much like the other books in the Osprey series, there is not a lot of room for too much detail. Quotations are minimal. The limited number of pages rule out historical debates. As such, THE ALAMO 1836 races straight toward definitive conclusions on issues that will never fully be confirmed or denied.The Osprey books are excellent stepping stones to other resources."
1,"Gaudy at best, poor worksmanship","They claim its silver, it's not. It is however pot-metal that has been plastic coated, mine had rust on it. The pendant is HUGE too, they should include dimensions for these things! They don't sent you a necklace with it, they send you a piece of leather string. If I wanted to tie my own necklace I would have just bought the pieces sperately cheaper! Overpriced piece of garbage."
2,meh...,The details of this necklace are kind of misleading. The black string that came with the necklace was kind of cheap and the pendant itself was nothing special. It is obviously fake and looks more gaudy than unique. I was under the impression that this was actual silver...its not.
2,Does not sync,"Although on purchase it mentions that it 'syncs' info to your palm, it does not. it has no sync button so a sync is not an option. good for charging the palm with usb."
3,OK,"There is no hotsync button. Still, it works and ,unlike the palm product, it will charge your phone through the usb cable. To hotsync you will need to pull up the Hotsync program on the palm device and tap the icon on the screen."
2,I could barely hear Ms. Harnoy!,"I bought this CD a few years ago since I'm a cellist and I wanted a really good recording of the Brahms cello sonatas. The first couple of times I heard it, I wasn't too impressed with the sound quality. The piano was way too loud and I could barely hear the beautiful melody that Ms. Harnoy produces on her cello. Ms. Harnoy is an outstanding cellist, but if you want a really good recording of the Brahms cello sonatas, save your pennies."
2,Autobiography of Sir Harry Smith,"To whom it may concern,It is inconceivable as to why this copy is so poor, with pages missing, and broad black print lines appearing at the bottom of every page corresponding to the second half of the original text.It was a really shoddy job!Never again!"
5,i fancy the ferret fancier,"this is the story of a young irish lad who is coming of age. he learns many of lifes lessons the hard way, but still manages to avoid getting into too much trouble.... the ferret symbolizes his life... being directed by those in control of him (ie: his parents, teachers, peers, girls, etc.) through the first two thirds of the book, but eventually being freed from his chains of lust towards women and acceptance....a good read... with a hint of irish dialect..."
1,Disappointing,Not what I expected. The author relayed a couple of personal experiences in his past. Didn't help me.
5,Saved my sanity,"About 4 practices and a game into the season I was totally frustrated. My practices were disorganized, and the team wasn't responding to any of my ""drills"". I found this book at the store and bought it. It was wonderful! I now had renewed hope, and a plan. The kids responded quickly, and I enjoyed coaching much more.The next season I started fresh after reading and re-reading the book. It was a great season, and many parents told me how much they enjoyed my coaching style, and the kids had fun too. I owe most of it to the book. I was more organized and polished."
4,Good book for the new coach,I was asked to coach my son's basketball team and I didn't know much about basketball. This book got me quickly started with the key fundamentals.
2,Just Not That Great,"Not that impressed with the coach's record who wrote the book. But more importantly than that I just didn't like the layout. Hard for me personally to follow. I coach 10U boys right now.I definitely think there are better options out there, read my other reviews."
4,Interesting unique features,"This is above average for a listen and learn audio course, with a couple of interesting and unique features. A lot of the dialog is embedded in a continuing story, which puts it in context and limits the boredom factor. The main character is an English visitor arriving in Spain, so it naturally covers the usual travel phrases. Each section ends by repeating the dialog with Spanish speakers at normal speed, giving the practice you will need to understand a real Spanish speaker. It is mostly Castillano, European Spanish, but it includes several characters from Latin America, so it can cover the differences between American and European Spanish. The differences don't matter much, but I am glad to know the differences and how little they matter. I'm planning to visit Andalucia, where the Spanish apparently falls somewhere in between."
3,A limited selection of old codes,"I would like to start off saying that I first bought this a year or two ago, and would of gave it a five. But now all the codes are old in about a month, and soon the book was collecting dust. And chances are you wont have a third of the games that have codes in that book. If you want codes in a book right by you.....and this book supports most of your games...then just BUY THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON NOW!!"
4,Coming Home,"Homecoming was America's second album and a strong follow-up to their debut. The album's title was appropriate because the trio was formed in England, but were American military kids stationed over there with their families. ""Ventura Highway"" was a top ten hit and has an unbelievably catchy guitar riff that drives the song. ""California Revisited"" has a harder rocking sound than most of their stuff and ""Don't Cross The River"" is a strong track."
5,America Fan Forever (And A Day),"I had to buy this CD so that I could listen to it at home on the turntable, as well as in my car and in my office..that goes for any or all America music! This one is especially great though..To Each His Own..Ventura Highway..Till the Sun Comes up Again..Head and Heart..oh, so many wonderful songs are on this CD..buy and enjoy!"
5,It gets Better,"I'm better at reviewing books. I just like it.Like it better than the first album and enjoy all the songs. America songs have a way of sticking in my headThe album is definitely more polished than the first album.One of the CD's I put in at work and can listen to consistently while concentrating on my work.Very 70's, but that is when I grew up."
5,Classic folk rock - music from college days,Great music. Converted my old obsolete vinyl Albums to CD with this purchase and then downloaded into my MP3 player. Listen to all the oldies driving to and from work. It brings me back to College days listening to the tunes I grew up on.
4,Absolute Success,"While winning the grammy award for best Artist of 1972 after their debut release album titled ""America"", ""Homecoming' was released with the same initial musical style while their sounds were much more polished and mature, reaching the Top Ten hits in the US and peaking to # 21 in The UK. The band was never able to reach this level afterward, although their third album ""Hat Trick"" is an absolute Jewel.America released many good albums through out their musical career; however, their first 3 album releases were surely their best.This is a definite ""Must Own"" album to all the fans or any person wanting to be introduced to this great band. Homecoming is a sure Soft Rock Classic."
5,America's Best Album,"This is in my opinion America's best album. Every song on the CD is very good. Great melodies, instrumentation and harmonies. If you like America's first CD (self-titled), be sure to pick this one up."
4,Derserve More Credit,"It seems that these guys lived in the shadow of CSNY, Eagles, and some of the earlier ""acoustic"" bands that hit the airwaves late 60s early 70's. They received a lot of FM airplay and had their share of hits, but they never were really considered ""serious"" players by the critics etc. I personally liked ""Horse With No Name"" when it first hit the radio, but I have to admit that it took a couple of albums for me to accept them as something other than imitators. Once they were putting out tunes like Ventura Highway and Tin Man, I was a believer. They had a very tight and distinct sound with great harmonies. They stuck with their acoustic roots and I have always felt they deserved a bit more credit for their output. I would highly recomend that anyone who skipped America the first time around pick up Homecoming, Hat Trick, or Hearts, and of course the debut self titled album."
1,Laughing all the way to the bank,"I just can't see the worth in this music. I'm far from being a classical music purist but Maksim is just a very average piano player with a pretty face and a great marketing team. 'Flight of the Bumblebee' is almost half the speed of other recordings, for example. It pains me to see this musack promoted as serious music. It is just souped up Richard Clayderman. Avoid."
1,Don't Get Burned,"Since our son was born, we've been using Coppertone Water Babies sunscreen, but didn't like that it stung if it got into his eyes. When we found this, we were thrilled. I even put it on my hands and rubbed it into my eyes to make sure it was truly ""tear free"". In that respect, it's great. However, we've used it twice on our son. The first time (last weekend), he got a little bit red, but today, after being in the sun for only two hours, he's got the worst sunburn ever. I'm devastated since I'm very careful about his sun exposure (we're both fair-skinned). In the year and a half of using Water Babies, he NEVER had a sunburn. I also used this sunscreen today and I am sporting the worst burn of my life as well...it looks as though we went without any sunblock at all. I hope someone can learn from our bad experience."
2,Stick with Coppertone!,"This stuff also promotes allergies, along with a nice sunburn if you use it. Why aren't they more careful with kids' products? This one should work, hands down, but doesn't. Now I've got to get the sunspots looked at by a dermatologist that were created while using this product. Do yourself and your child a favor, stay with Coppertone!"
1,Do NOT risk using this product!,"I am very careful about the sun exposure during the summer. I bought Banana Boat Tear Free for Baby SPF 50 for my 2 yr old son and for myself, thinking that we can use it at the pool since it is advertised as 'Very Water Resistant'. I used it during our trip to a water park last weekend. Even though I was generously re-applying the cream every hour, we both got seriously sunburned.This cream did not do ANYTHING to protect the skin from the sun. I did not put this cream on my face, and instead used my daily facial moisturizer with SPF 15, and the SPF 30 facial power on top. That protected my face and it did not get burned. This just proves how ineffective this Banana Boat product is.This tells me that Banana Boat product is as good as smearing oil on your body to attract more sun instead of protecting the skin from sun burns. I would recommend to NEVER risk using this product, especially on children."
1,"Evergreen/ Grassroots, 9th Edition. Unimpressive!","I have used earlier editions of Evergreen and Grassroots extensively in my classes, but am unimpressed with the supposed improvements/changes in the 9th edition.The small type face and rather shiny finish on the thin pages makes the text hard to read.Much of the content is identical to older editions; in fact, I get the impression the publisher has merely revamped the book in order to publish a ""new"" edition for more profit.Additionally, this text now assumes a greater ease of access to the Internet than is feasible for many students.I particularly dislike not receiving a printed copy of the Instructor's Annotated Edition. Using it on-line is quite inconvenient.This book is not worth the expense, especially when one considers that students can't really re-sell used books because the practices are already completed on the pages.Very disappointing. I shall be recommending other texts for my classes. (8/20/10)"
2,Not too happy,"Before buying this book it said it was very good, no markings etc.,when the book arrived, the book had all the excercises done with markings in all the pages. I paid 20.00, thinking it was a great buy. i'm not pleased with the description they gave for this book."
2,Not what I was expecting,I read that the book just had a few pages in bad state but is worse than what was said in the description
2,Little More Than A User Guide,"After reading all of the wonderful reviews of this book I bought a copy. Unfortunately, when I compare the price paid for the book with the value I received, I have to conclude that the publisher got the better end of the deal. This book is more than a users guide, but only a little bit more. My recommendation is to get a book on Act from the library, and save your money."
3,Definitely needs stakes,I bought this for when we go camping. We have a 30 pound mutt and a 50 pound German Shepard mix. The cage is really tall which I like but it is not very sturdy on its own. With 1 dog in it the cage was knocked over within about 2 minutes. We ended up having to make it a rectangle and stick it between two picnic tables and bungy cord it down. I think it could be better with stakes but we haven't tried that yet so I will have to update after the next camping trip.
3,Great on my DVD player but not on her's,"The whole purchase deal was great, like always. That's how Amazon stays in business, no complaints there. However the DVD movies discs themselves seem to be somewhat flawed because although they play just find on my DVD player, they skip and malfunction on my friend's older DVD player (items purchased for her.) She wanted to return the items but I was able to convince her that she simply needed to upgrade to a newer DVD player. So guess what I am buying her for Christmas? Anyways, apart from this, everything was good."
5,Into the West,"Very good, well written and showed the struggles of the Native Americans trying to adapt to settlers moving into their lands as well as the struggles of the settlers going into the new territories. Good acting, especially by Tyler Christopher, who plays Jacob Wheeler Jr."
4,Into the West,"Product arrived promptly and in excellent condition. My only hesitation, if there is one, is the packaging. Would have preferred a hard dvd case, rather than plastic."
4,I enjoyed it,I watched this when it first aired and thought it was pretty good. I ordered it and watched it again. I still like it. Not the best miniseries I have ever watched but I enjoyed it. many other reviewers think it is sanitized and poorly edited. It may be. All I can tell you is that I still enjoyed it.
2,This is a very biased piece of film,"Some historical truth, but overall, this is a mostly biased piece of storytelling. Funny how this portrays the white man as the evil influence. Funny how they only tell only half of the story, and that part is murky at best. Sad that most Americans most likely will believe this account, and feel guilt for conquering this land. What a shame."
5,Review of Into The West,This is an absolutely wonderful saga of the West. The first two hours of this move are definitely true. My husband and I were out West last year and visited the actual spot that is in the movie where the buffalo were run over the cliff. It was amazing how I felt when I saw it on the screen and realized that we had stood on that very place.I recommend this to everyone. It's story that you won't soon forget.I had been waiting for it to come out so I could get it and watch it all over again.
1,did the full version come out yet?,I have been waiting to buy this dvd set but will not until they release the full version and not the ''classroom'' edited version.does anyone know if they have? or will? what a waste if not.
3,Into the West,"I'm really disappointed. For years I've wanted this mini-series because when it first aired I missed a couple of episodes. I do remember that the character, Abe Wheeler, worked on the railroad and became friends with a Chinaman. In this 4 disk set, a lot is missing. It never showed Tom Berenger at all. Even the girl on the cover i don't remember seeing. As badly as I have wanted this, It is a gyp. Is this something Mr. Spielberg wanted to do? What a gyp. I've even gone directly to TNT where it aired to see if I could get my hands on the full length edition, but it booted me right back to Amazon. As badly as I want this, I cannot just settle. This chopped up version just does not set well with me. I've just returned the set that I ordered."
3,An OK epic.,"I was really excited about this mini series when it first came out. Kerri Russell, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Modine, and Sean Astin were in it and I love to watch all of them. The first 3 episodes were good. We met Jacob Wheeler and his family. We see how he lives and how his family started making their way to the WEST. After that, I lost interest because the storyline got too complex. I think it would have been better if they had taken the time to add more scenes or even episodes to make the movie flow better. Added to that, we never find out what happens to Rachel Wheeler, Kerri Russell. SHe marries a Indian chief and she gives birth, but we never hear another thing about her.Like I said before, this is an OK epic but hardly the best. If you want to see a good mini series about the settling of the West, I would recommend ""Centinial."" It is a wonderful series that will be coming soon to DVD."
5,This is truly worth watching!,"This is truly worth watching! It is historically accurate yet draws you into the story through character depiction and threaded storyline. The cinematography was stunning and believable. The amount of research and consultation makes this story a MUST SEE. Well, well done!!"
3,Into the West,Because this was a gift shipped directly to the receipient I have'nt seen it and am unable to review it.
5,Into the West,Bought as a gift. I've only seen bits and pieces of it. Gave it to boyfriend so we could watch together. Love this type of movie
1,Fullscreen or Widescreen?,"On the description this DVD sounds very interesting and with a total of 6 discs should be complete, but it is?And, Amazon..........under your ""Format:"" you list both fullscreen and Widescreen. WHICH IS IT?Also, why don't you mention that is is ""For classrooms"" and that it is edited. OR IS IT?With the reviews here, I'm surprised ANYONE would buy a copy."
5,An Epic for the Ages,"I was completely ""blown away"" by the Epic ""Into The West"". I think this movie should be shown to ALL Middle School and High School age children. It was extremely well done and the references to true historical events was commendable. I ordered it not realizing that it was an Historical Epic. My heart ached for the injustice and ignorance that prevailed at the times depicted. This is an historical view I did not get in school. I think ""Into The West"" has relevance for today......a timeless message that calls us to justice and honor and the ""will"" to survive the unconscionable."
3,Horrible Editing Decision,"I was ready to purchase this set and I even picked it up at the store and I was going to buy it but then I noticed that it said it was edited for ""classroom viewing"". The demographic for this show was not even close to child's age. I also can't think of a single classroom that would air a twelve hour show. It would take too long. I will purchase this DVD when it is sold in its original format and I encourage all of you to do the same."
5,I agree with the first review,"I saw the film when it came out on TNT. My home is decorated in an Indian style as a tribute to what was done to a gallant and trusting people. When the film was released on DVD I immediately bought 2 of them, one for me and the other for my daugher who lives in Los Angeles. The first chance I got to watch it was this weekend and I thought there was a mistake made. I distinctly remember the ghost dances and how tears rolled down my cheeks at the climax of Wounded Knee. Meanwhile these are not on the DVD set. Is TNT nuts? I want my money back because this is ridiculous. There should at least have been a warning that there was an edited version for sale and not try to pull something on people who loved the movie and care about a people that were the victims of clear attempt at genocide."
2,Edited to Pieces,"I found this DVD collection extremely frustrating. Good characters and acting, but the worse editing I have ever seen. Huge gaps that leave the viewer in a state of total confusion. For instance, why did the mountain man Wheeler leave the love of his life, his Indian wife, for what looked like fifteen years? Why didn't he know where she was? What happened to Keri Russell? I heard that she married an Indian chief, but why didn't I see that? Did I turn my head to look at something else in the room and miss it somehow? Did the original series really end with George pecking at his typewriter? That seemed to be a weak, bleak ending leaving him there at the school with the maniacal master. Later I read on line that the set had been edited for use in the classroom. What a mess. Whoever did this took a great story and reduced it to tatters. Why would these people imagine that tatters make a good school lesson? Does anyone know where or how I can see the full version that was on TV?"
1,"Into the West -- Unedited, Uncut","This miniseries is severely edited in its commercial DVD release. However, it was issued in its entirety, as televised, for Emmy consideration to Emmy members. This version is available now, used, from other web sites, although bidding may be involved in acquiring one. What a shame the commercial release is not complete."
2,Disappointing,"I've noticed that a few other reviewer's have compared ITW to Centennial. ITW,unlike,Centennial introduced characters and then ""forgot"" about them. Example: What happened to Kerry Russell's,""Naomi Wheeler"",her Indian Chief husband & their child???? What happened to Abe Wheeler??? I found ITW a giant let-down. The cast was first-rate. The writing sadly was not."
3,Into the West,"Great viewing, however for me it is still too much about the white mans perspective with enormous amount of time spent on their daily lives and what they endured whilst stealing lands belonging to others and not enough about the First Nations peoples daily lives. The actors were all tremendous."
2,Into The West Review,"Although the film was somewhat intertaining, it was far from being histoically accurate as advertised. I was disappointed in the way it presented a one sided view of historical events involving issues with Indians, especially with the Custer battle at the Little Big Horn. ""Political Corectness"" and ""Historical Revisionism"" is ruining our culture."
1,UNRATED VERSION,YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE SERIES HAS IT WAS I WAS READY TO PURCHASE IT BUT NOW I CANNOT I NEED IT TO BE IN THE ORIGINAL FORM. I KNOW TNT CAN FIX IT SO DO SO BECAUSE A CUT VERSION OF ANYTHING ISN'T WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD.
2,upset and annoyed,I was sadden to hear the version was not fully the real movie that was shown in TNT and AMC. People who have bought this video were trusting enough to buy a video that was edited they should be angry. I would hope they put the video with better classification so others can wait for the full version. I am glad that people are allowed to veiw comments as I would have bought this video and would have been very disappointed. Let hope the director hear about the mishap and correct the mistake the wasichus have made and let the movie appear with all its might and truths.
5,Television DVD,"This was a perfect gift. The price was low, in perfect condition, and arrived very quickly. I would definitely purchase further items from this seller in the future."
3,into the west,it was ok. compare it to centennial it needs alittle more action. the actors did a fine job.
2,Into the West- DVD,"I loved Into the West when we viewed it on television. I was however, very disappointed when we watched the dvd that I ordered from you. It didn't have the whole story as the TV version. After reading the reviews, I noticed that my opinion was not the only one with the same complaint.What a disappointment. I would not recommend this dvd if you watched the mini series on television."
2,Give Us A Real Box Set!,"I got ""Into The West"" as soon as it was released on DVD. It was chopped up, the ""extra"" stuff was just bogus and there was no soundtrack as originally promised. As a matter of fact, TNT and Dreamworks haven't released the soundtrack!! Only some bogus ""music inspired from the movie"" which other than a reworking of Sarah's song, wasn't interesting.There are some great scenes cut from the movie,too, that weren't even in the version shown on TNT. Kerri Russel's character had a real neat saga that they did not pursue. Her camp was attacked and she was taken back by white soldiers whom she escapes from to go back to her Native family.Give us a real box set, please!"
2,"""World On Fire"" NOT inspired by this","Sarah McLachlan released World On Fire in 2003 - TWO YEARS BEFORE the mini-series. The duet and accompanying video were in response to this. But the original song was not inspired by it.As to buying the DVD, I was going to get one for my mother for a Christmas present. I watched it on TNT and really enjoyed it. However, I am not going to buy her an edited version."
5,Into the West,This is one of the best sagas of all time. Tells of white man's takeover and westernizing of the American Indians. A wonderfully made and executed story.
1,has the full version ever been released?,I agree with the poor reviews. I can you go to DVD and shred the story. It shold be in reverse. The DVD should have more......Does anyone know if the full (uncut) version was ever released?
5,"Loved it on TV, sent as a gift","I purchased this for my Dad for his birthday as he is interested in things to do with Native Americans and the old West. I loved this program myself when I watched it during airing and know he will love it, too."
2,Not worth the Hype,"Bought this series for my mom and dad, who ONLY watch Westerns. I saw the great rating on amazon and expected something epic like Lonesome Dove Series....it definitely was not as good as Lonesome Dove. The beginning starts really good and then it slowly becomes more and more boring. More and more characters are introduced into the story, until it becomes over complicated and you lose any real concern or connection with the characters. I stopped watching in episode two, My parents finished the series and said it was (at best) ""ok"". If you are really bored...Get it! If you are expecting a remarkable Western, brace for possible disappointment."
3,Into the West,The movie is wonderful. But I received a disck with one whole episode missing. I have not had time to return it.
5,Pretty good show for its time.,"A nice documentary about the portrayal of dinosaurs in film and TV over the years, pointing out accuracies, inaccuracies, and famous moments. At the end, contains a series of trailers for dinosaur and dinosaur-related films."
5,Got it as advertised,"Got it as advertised. The packaging was fine. It was on time. Sadly, they don't fit my container. My bad."
5,at least they have dimensions,"I'm looking for a gasket that was ~3 in. inside dia. or ~75 mm, with an O.D. of 4 in or 100 mm. This at least had the size."
4,Just What I Was Looking For,"My set of glass jars for flour, sugar, coffee, pasta, etc. needed to have the gaskets replaced as the old ones were brittle & disintegrating after many year of wear & these worked perfectly."
5,Very pleased!,I am so delighted with these replacement jar rubbers. Took a long time to decide which ones I wanted but it was worth the effort. They are very easy to put on and look so classy. I had some white ones years ago that I couldn't use because they were too thick and impossible to stretch on. The price is very reasonable as well. Let's see now how long they last. I am going to highly recommend them to others.
5,hard to find!,"I was worried these gaskets wouldn't fit, or would smell rubbery/fishy--all things that I had read about. Nonsense! They fit my Triomphe jars perfectly, and were offered at a great price."
5,"Like others say - don't measure your old rings, they're all stretched out!","Like many others, I thought I'd ordered the wrong size when these arrived. Compared with the old ones, these seemed tiny. But that's becuase the old ones are all stretched out. For regular-size jars (an average man's hand barely fits through the mouth), this is the size you want. It's a great deal!"
5,Nice Gaskets!,"I ordered these gaskets for my mom cause she needed them for some mason jars, but she doesn't know how to work the interwebs. Don't tell her I said that.Anyway, they came quickly and were totally round, rubber, and in the specified quantity! SWEET!They are in her jars now keeping her flour, sugar, and other dry ingredients fresh and bug free for once.Thanks guys.FIVE STARS!"
5,canning jar lids,"The rubber gaskets I ordered were the exact size, brand new, and arrived on scheudle. I am very pleased with this purchase and seller."
3,Works!!,We bought some vintage jars at a thrift store and needed the gasket to make the seal. These were perfect and the price in comparison to other sites was the lowest.
1,NOT SILICONE!,"I'm glad to see that these seals are not cheap Chinese, but Italian manufacture. However, they do not last very long before they dry out, crack and simply fail to seal. Anyone finding these in silicone, please post here - I'm looking, too!"
3,Just as ordered,Product was just as I had ordered but they seem to be a bit big for the decanters I was using them on. Am keeping them though for lack of having nothing else.
2,"Knock, Knock! Who's There? Sand Shark!","Really cheesy B-movie script and characters, and a total lack of suspense due to the near-immediate showing of the mysterious menace, all but ruin this sci-fi pulper that would only be mediocre even if it didn't have these problems.The episode has two things going for it: nice production design in terms of the rocketships and Martian landscape, and some pretty neat monsters. The sand sharks are great fun.But then they're dispatched by an ""atomic bazooka"" - need I say more?"
5,I found it!!!,I have been thinking about this game for years. I used to play it with my family when I was a kid. I got it for my kids last Christmas and they love it!!
4,Fun game,Enjoyed this game. I think it will be really nice for the age suggested. It was a little longer play then I thought it would be but held our attention just the same.
5,"Wonderful memory game but forget the ""magic""","The point of the game is to guess under what tree the king's treasure is hidden. So you have to walk around remembering what items are under each tree.It took a couple tries to get into the swing of the game. Now that we've practiced coming up with stories to help remember what items are where, it's a fun game.The only problem is the ""magic"" where you bump people to the beginning. Skip that rule. With 5 people playing, it's near impossible to finish because you're always going to be bumping into one another. So we let people occupy the same space. The game is much faster and fun this way."
4,Enchanted Forest enchanting for all,I bought this for my 8 year old daughter who is into enchanted everything. She picked up the strategy immediately and loves to try and beat Mommy-and sometimes does. My 4 1/2 year old is starting to get the idea and enjoys playing along with assistance. Great fun for all.
2,Like Watching Paint Dry ?,"If so, then this game is right up your alley. I bought it for our 6 year old daughter after reading the rave reviews. Ummmm .... unless we were doing something seriously wrong, I dont get what all the excitement was about. Its dull, it takes FOREVER to get through, and it was a definite Christmas miss at our house. The overall concept sounded great, but the execution was lacking. That being said, the game components are of a beautiful quality, and Im sure that even with a lot of play, that this game would last quite a while. Not our cup of tea, but if you enjoy spending upwards of an hour with a child's ""no reading required"" board game, and getting absolutely nowhere, then this is the game for you. Cannot recommend."
2,Not worth the money,"I. Bought this game because it looked like something a bit different and had decent reviews. It is so boring. My daughter is almost 7 and it barely keeps her attention. You have to keep repeating your moves and ""peeking"" under the pieces. Not very creative, very disappointed, especially after spending $20.00 on it."
4,This is a good choice!,"This course (DVD + Books) may not be the most fun, but it does cover all the bases better than any other SINGLE course out there. To tell you my honest opinion if having fun while learning the guitar is what you want to do, then I would say go with ""Guitar Basics"" by Bruce Buckingham and work your way up through the Musicians Institue series of courses. The main difference between these series is that Guitar Method starts with reading music and picking out ""lame"" melodies, where as Guitar Basics starts you out with playing chords and chord progressions. So the decision is really in the hands of where you want to start. Chords or notes?"
2,No impressed,"I bought this dvd because of the list of songs in Product Description. It says: ""You'll learn to play the songs:...."" but in most of the cases they are not the songs but small riffs. Also this dvd is difficult to navigate and you can not loop the exercises.I learn some tricks from the dvd but the bottom line is that I was disappointed."
1,Quality and Quantity both inadequate,"There isn't much on this DVD - perhaps its only 40 minutes at most. It's only 11 very short songs, and a few riffs and licks, less than most guitar books. Also, the poor editing of the DVD makes practicing along with the DVD much, much harder than it needs to be. Do not buy this DVD without the book, or you'll never be able to practice enough to really learn the songs before you thow your guitar thru your TV. The idea of a DVD to go with a book is genius, and the material and the featured teacher are great, but they need more material, and a better idea of how a student might actually use it."
3,"Useful, but only along with the book","I recently purchased the Hal Leonard Guitar Method book, packaged with a CD and this DVD. The DVD is good, because there is a brief explanation by Kolb before each song, but a beginner needs to work on the book alone before jumping in to the DVD. The DVD should probably only be sold together with the book. One other catch: the written music that scrolls along the bottom of the screen is sometimes too slow and often doesn't appear until Kolb begins to play. The viewer needs to see the music to begin the song. I had to get a quick look at the beginning of the song, then rewind before I could play many of the songs. Stll worth while, but get the book also."
4,nice job,i like it you can go at your speed that's what i like about this and you can go back any time
5,great dvd,"I have wanted to get back to playing my guitar, I started over 20 years ago, this dvd it very easy to follow I recommend it highly"
5,Another Masterpiece,"Again, I was floored by the sheer magnitude of research and imagination that it took for Steve Barnes to write this sequel to LION'S BLOOD. The intricately woven story of an alternate universe where Africans were the slaveowners of European Americans is mindboggling in its presentation. Through the stories of the young Kai and his slave/friend, Aidan, the reader is emersed into a saga that is both enlightening and unforgettable in its portrayal of the ""what if"" factor.Barnes attempts the impossible and more than surpasses all expectations I had for the epic. LION'S BLOOD and ZULA HEART are two must haves for any Barnes/Sci-Fi fans."
3,MISSING A COUPLE OF POPULAR CUES,"As an owner of all three volumes purchased separately, I feel that I'm entiltled to express an opinion of this set. Disc 1. The Cage is surprisingly exciting. Where No Man Has Gone Before is very weak. Disc 2. The Doomsday Machine and Amok Time. Both are intense and exciting. My favorite of the set. Disc 3. Shore Leave is somewhat weak. The Naked Time, not as weak as the other entries, but still not as strong as The Cage, Doomsday, or Amok time. Two cues that come to mind (and I'm sure there are a lot more) that are missing is, one: The haunting choral music of the Vulcan mind meld. And two: a piece hard to describe, but is cleary heard in The City On The Edge of Forever. After the 1920s period piece music ends while Captain Kirk and Edith Keeler are out for an evening stroll the music changes to a progressive intensity as we see Spock and his makeshift transistorized crystal ball. Star trek fans know THAT piece very well."
4,pretty good...,"If you ask me, you should read the books first, then watch the movies. The other way around kinda spiols it. I like how the movies are visual, I am a visual person after all (kinda). I still think that the books are better than the videos because they have a longer storyline and a really interesting one, not that I am saying that the videos don't, because they do, they are just kinda dilluting it, that's all. Read book #1, then go down to your local video renting store and check out the first video in the series and you'll see what I mean. The videos are pretty good though, beleive me. The books are better, however, if you want a really good book to read, choose the Holy Bible, God's word."
3,"Well, it's okay.......................","I really like the books, but the movie twisted things around WHAY to much. To start:A)Where's Marco's sense of humor? B)Why does Visser 3 spend so much time in human morph? C)Ax is found in the ocean, NOT the construction site! D) Andilites DO NOT have manes! Where'ed they get that idea? E) After the first setence, Ax speaks perfectly- where's the stuttering? F) Why is Ax always in human morph? G)Why can't we ever see an ENTIRE andalite? H) THERE IS NO DISK! I)Andalite have 7 NOT 5 fingers J)Rachel is an ELEPHANT, not a lion, and Marco is a grorrila K)Where are the morphing outfits? L) Ax is supposed to be a technaligical genius M) Where's Cassie's morphing talent?Now that I'm done griping, I have to say, the special effects are ok. The morphing is cool, very realistic. I like the acting, they got Ax's fixation on taste very well. They protray Visser 3's personality very well. If it had been a little more true to the books, it would have been AWESOME!!!"
2,"GO K.A. , BOO NICK!","I've not actually seen this video but from the picture on the front I think tha it's about tse episode based on book 12(?) ""The Reaction"" even though in the book it's Rachel who has a spontainous morping frenzy. Nick idi d okey bringing this to the small screen ,sike! the show stinks! there is hardly any resemblents to the book excep the very basic plot of aleins invading earth if you ask me, it dosent have the right to bear the animorph name! (by the way, where have all the Taxxons gone?)"
4,Awesome Book and Video!,"THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME! I LIKE THE BOOK BETTER BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS CHANGE STUFF IN THE VIDEO! BY THE WAY, DOES ANYONE KNOW IF RACHEL HAS A CRUSH ON TOBIAS OR VICE-VERSA?"
2,The plots are not as good,"The TV show and these videos are okay, but in a lot of them, they are taking a very exciting book and trying to cram it into 25 minutes. So parts are being left out to save time, and I would rather read the book than watch the show. (Isn't that how it usually is?)"
1,Why is everyone rating this so high?,"I'll make this as simple as possible. First off, some people have read the Animorph books and think they are great so they assume that the show and movies are just as good. Well, they're wrong. Take it from someone who has seen nearly the entire first episode. Second, The people who really like the show probaly are not hardcore Animorph fans and are more casual fans. A hardcore fan can tell the difference between the books and the TV show and movies. There are lots of other big problems, but this is the biggest. So read the books. Then you'll find the big differences."
2,"Good, but doesn't cut it.","I loved the Animorph books when I read them, but the short-lived TV show on Nickelodeon had the wrong actors, cheesy lines, and no Taxxons. The only thing that saves this video from failing is the cool special effects and the way they made Ax and the Hork-Bajir. Also, I hope that a real, feature-length movie comes out in a couple of months, and that it's better than the TV show. Not rated."
2,La. me,"The books are great but they have changed so much! The actors don't live up to their job, the jokes are sidesplitting (NOT!) and the plotlines are twisted around- KAA should get another TV company to do the effects"
1,Taxxons?,In the books there are Taxxons But there aren't any in the show!!!!!! Where are they???!!!???!!!
4,Should be considered a standard reference on Lovecraft.,"Anyone looking to find out more about their favorite Horror Writer H. P. Lovecraft, should definitely read Darrell's extensive study. The Bibliography of rare editions and his background biographical information makes this a must with all the dates of publication and actual time frames of publishing cycles expertly annotated and chronologically noted. A must for every Lovecraft fan. Loki(S.D. Larkin)"
2,DVD wanted,"I did not realize that it was a VHS Tape. Big mistake was paying for it. I don't own VHS player any longer. Next time, I will be more observant. I do know that this show has a complete set on DVD and now just part 1 on this tape. What a disappointment but I still would like to have the complete set on DVD for PBS. The sending process went fine."
5,Another Level,"Any Grappelli disc is worth the money, but this one has a bonus.We don't often get to hear the recorded work of one of the best jazz guitarists alive today, Mike Gari. Grappelli,Taylor, and Sewing are always a treat to hear. Mike Gari's solos, however, take this disc to another extraordinary level."
1,VERY average hairspray,"I bought this based on an amazon review of this product saying this was a strong hold hairspray,IT IS NOT!!! I found it to be very average hold hair spray at an OUTRAGEOUS price. I wouldnt have minded the cost,had it held better.Amazon was nice as always about returning it."
3,Insta hold,So I bought this product on a whim and its great if you want that instant hold. I however have short hair and like to fix the little stray hairs after I've used hairspray to make sure everything is in place and its almost impossible with this spray as its hold is almost instantaneous and trying to adjust your hair almost messes it up.
5,Masterful storyteller of the human condition,"McCullers' captures the essence and delicacies of love in ""The Ballad of the Sad Cafe."" Three highly unusual lovers attempt to understand their feelings and desires. Each lover becomes a beloved and nothing seems to work positively. But look more closely: The real lover is the unidentified narrator, who painfully (as experienced by a lover) tells the story. The other stories included in the book magnify and enhance McCullers' universal concept of love and the loneliness and isolation of every lover. This is truly a book to read and enjoy. Then, think about it!"
2,Captivating writing with a bewildering result.,"Found the writing to this short story very captivating and it kept me wanting to finish reading it; however, was a bit bewildered when the end was reached. Not quite sure what this story was meant to accomplish? Was disappointed that the author did not reveal certain unknowns to the reader in the end. Would be interested in knowing why this is such a popular story...am I missing something?"
2,What's the deal?,"Another book hyped as a great masterpiece and I have to question ""why""?McCullers' prose is nice, economical, and flows easily. The stories themselves struck me as rather unexceptional."
5,My one-year old loves this!,"Sometimes these Priddy books can get overwhelming--too many floating objects and too much activity on each page. But I really like this Baby 123 book. There are simple animal pictures for each number on the page (one tiger on the first page, two baby faces on the second page, etc.). It's easy to follow, and my one-year old daughter has no trouble focusing while we read and turn the thick pages together.The last couple pages are a bit more complicated, requiring that she find and match certain objects. Honestly, most of the time, we stop reading before we get to those pages, because they aren't as much fun. Still, the book, overall, is great, and it has become one of her favorites."
4,Perfect to teach!,"I got this book to teach to my 2 1/2-year-old boy who is fascinated by numbers right now. It works for teaching him, and then having fun... He loves the book. Actually, he asks me to count with the book before, and during bed time... ;-)"
4,"Good, but gave me deja vou","We like these books - they're great for the little bitty babies. My son is 3 mos and will still look at these bright, bold pictures. My only beef is that some/many of the pictures are re-used in other Priddy books (Happy Baby books and Bright Baby books). It would be nice to have totally original books if you're buying a set, instead of what sometimes feels like just slapping together old pics and putting a new cover on. All in all, though, I really like these books."
3,"It's amazing! But, oh God...","This book is absolutely AMAZING! But I give it three stars because of the DRAWINGS. Oh, god. They make me want to rip up the book and never see it again. The drawings are HORRIBLE. A 10-year old could do better than this! I don't mean to be so dramatic but it's true. The book itself is very good, though."
3,The first was one good but then not so much,"The first book was great! I read it in like a day but then it all went down. The book is kinda hard to under stand what exactly going on it like "" who is this charcter?? "" where did he come from? or where did she come from?The frist was is a must read if you do enjoy it you can read the rest."
5,L O V E it,I love this book it rocks within the first 20 pgs I was sooo hooked I love it and I can not wait to read the rest of the series
2,not 2 good,my mom bought me 3 of these books cuase she read about them and then read the amazon customer reviews. i just read the reviews here and i cant beleive my mom thought they were from real girls. real girls dont talk like that.grown ups like the writer's mom or friends or someone talk like that. they are totally fake. first of all the beacon street girls are not that interesting and their problems are like out of a newspaper. i dont think these are well written or interesting and i showed them to my friends. we like series of unfortuante events much better or harry potter or litle house on the prairie or books by corneila funke. theres a new book out my mom bought me that is really good called the penderwicks. that one is really good. get that instead.
4,Wort Enemies/Best Friends,"I thought this was a really good book. It was very down-to earth, so it needed a little more action. This book had the charectres going through some of the same things in my life, like problems with mean girls, gossip,and being a new kid."
5,GREAT COLLECTION,You want great Star Trek music look no further! This CD has the best music from TNG
5,Great album from start to finish,"This is the only album where all of the songs are great. Granted some are better than others, but overall, there isn't one song that I wouldn't want to listen to over and over. The depth of the music is unmatched in any other artist."
2,"Scratched CD, but return policy seems reasonable.","A 2-disc product disappointed me when I found the Music CD was scratched or somehow damaged. I wanted to play it for friends at a party and could not use it.Furthermore, the music was mainstream classical, including Beethoven -- pieces that are easily available in any music lover's library. I expected to find country dances, and other pieces that Austen and friends would actually perform in their homes.Apparently easy return policy is a very good thing."
2,Worth reading but not great,"For a diehard Austen fan, any sequel or attempt is of interest. I found this book to have a much darker tone than all of Austen's work. Aiken takes the story on a path of brooding, sickness and poverty. The characters are drawn with a much heavier hand and seem to be generally bitter and unhappy in a very 20th century way. Worth reading, but if you read Austen to visit a happier, simpler era, this is not the way to go."
2,Falls apart halfway through - Try John Coates,"I don't expect Aiken to fool me into thinking that this is Austen's work, but I do expect a competent novel. This was initially promising, but it begins to descend into melodrama. The ending is very perfunctory; the heroine finds her ""true love"" with almost magically with little development of their relationship. What is there is quite good, it is just not substantial enough for me to believe that the moment Emma catches sight of him, she knows that they are going to be married.After reading this andLady Catherine's Necklace (A Jane Austen entertainment), Aiken's sequel to Pride and Prejudice, it appears to me that the author is rather bored with romances - I strongly recommend that she try writing something else. It is possible to write a historical novel of this period without leeching off of Austen.I strongly recommend John Coates' finishing of this fragment,The Watsons;: Jane Austen's fragment continued and completed by John Coates."
3,"Not bad, not very romantic","It's not as bad as the reviews it's been getting, but this book has huge holes. The characters are interesting though. My biggest problem with it was the romance it is was about three paragraphs long."
4,Emma Watson delights,"While you may not feel that Jane Austen would have taken the story in this direction, in Joan Aiken's hands the story is absorbing, detailed and delightful. Her style is more common sensical and tends to veer towards realism. Births, deaths, marriages that work, marriages that don't. Great style. Though she pays hommage to Jane Austen by completing Emma Watson, this is a book that can stand alone and face applause. I have read many ""wannabe"" Jane Austen books and her novels are by far the best."
