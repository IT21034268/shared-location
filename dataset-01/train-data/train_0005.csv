4,Touch of Gold,"Whatever Bill Frisell touches seems to turn to ""gold"". And the sweetest punch is another in a long line of golden eggs.Add to that some great vocals by Cassandra Wilson and of course Elvis Costello and you truely have some sweet sweet punch. Drink it up!"
2,all-round disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Costello, a big fan of Bacharach, and through Deep Dead Blue, became a fan of Frisell. This combination seemed too good to be true, and actually, I was so looking forward to hearing it as one piece that I saved listening to it until I had a long car journey.Sadly, the Sweetest Punch is much less than the sum of the parts.I understand that Bill recorded it without hearing Elvis & Burt's finished album. I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really."
2,Is it just me....or....,"Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on ""TOLEDO"".I loved ""Painted From Memory""- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g ""Painted from Memory"", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is ""God Give Me Strength"", which on all other recordings is amazing."
5,beautiful,"This was a can't-miss concept, and the result was even greater than I assumed it would be. Frisell proves himself as an imaginative orchestrator, never heavy-handed. The feeling of the album is light but substantive, effervescent but always grounded in the deep well of musicianship brought to the project by Frisell, Costello/Bacharach, and a lineup that includes such giants as Brian Blade, Don Byron and Cassandra Wilson."
5,infinite tonal possibilities,"This is about the most versatile bass amp I've ever had. It's very clean and punchy and has plenty of power. with two preamps, a compressor, a graphic eq and high and low contour controls, this amp covers it all. Hard to beat for the price."
2,only 1 in the bag,">:I assumed that the 3 items in the picture was what I was buying, not 1, what am gonna do with one?"
3,Fine show marred by editing,"This video was a fine effort by Tina Turner and her crew. The music was energetic, exciting, and well paced. The only complaint I had was that the camera wouldn't sit still. There were many scenes that cried for a more lingering focus but instead jumped from one scene to the next like the mouse ride at an amusement park. Maybe the editor was just too impatient or underestimated the attention span of his audience. In any case, many stunning visuals were lost to the viewer and a fine performance was compromised because of it."
5,Always the Best...,"The woman known to rock and roll history as Tina Turner proves once again why she is, and will always be, the ""Queen of Rock and Roll."" Fiery and dynamic."
2,"Excellent show, poor sound","Unfortunatelly the DVD is dissapointing for Tina's fans. The show is fantastic, but both Dolby Digital and DTS version of this DVD have one of the worst sounds I ever heard. My subwoofer didn't move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames. More, the soundtrack was re-edited with sound taken from other concerts (that's incredible - at one moment I swear that I heard the word Munchen despite the fact that the concert is in Amsterdam). And, oh yes, the DVD is overpriced. Forget ""Amsterdam"" and don't miss ""One Last Time in Concert"" as it has verry good sound quality and image. Not speaking abut the phantastic show..."
2,What a Cryin' Shame ....,"I love Tina. Her music is the epitome of energizing soul-rock. We looked forward to this DTS version of her concert. We put it in, sat back, and after 5 minutes into the concert I was becoming agitated at what should be a great show. The music was great, but after 30 minutes I was going nuts. Then it dawned on me: the camera work is absolutely the worst. It's horrible. It detracts from the concert. It never stops moving. It never stops fading in & out. It jumps from one angle to another. It changes every few seconds and it never stops for the whole concert. A bunch of high school kids could have done better. I hope we can find another Tina concert worth buying but the Amsterdam concert was a waste of our money. What a cryin' shame."
4,One Problem,"Tina is great. I bought this because of the song selection on the DVD. The only problem is when she goes into Proud Mary and the band kicks in after her intro for a moment and then she goes back to her intro the sound is distorted. I have a very good system and while this was on medium sound,the sound was distorted during this 3 second burst of drums and bass during the intro to this song. What is going on?"
5,This is super!!!!!,Miss Turner never fades!!!! She will always be number one!!!. This is a must see for everyone young and old alike!!!! Grrrrrreat Show!!!!!
5,A truly entertaining concert,"Tina Turner outdoes herself! She really knows how to work a stage (almost a lost talent in the MTV era), and the music is first-rate. It is no wonder that the entire tour was such an incredible success. Turner also surrounded herself with first-rate musicians and dancers. I heartily recommend this video to anyone."
3,How Bad Editing Can Destroy a Really Fine Performance,"My wife and I were greatly disappointed by the sparseness of Tina in this Tina Turner production. The video editor must have been wired on cocaine! The rapid change of scenes was especially disturbing on the classic ""Proud Mary,"" where the editor seemed to believe that the camera angle must change with each change of beat. Due to the rapid changing of scenes, we don't get to see very much of Tina Turner. Most regrettable, because she is the best part of the show--such emotion, facial expression, gestures--a true one-woman show. Unfortunately, we miss most of that due to the poor editing."
4,Tina - Live in Amsterdam.,This is a great concert by Tina.Very entertaining from start to finish.Nowhere near as good as Tina - One last time in concert ( which was brilliant) but still extremely good and a must have for any fan of Tina.
5,What a show!,"This is a great DVD of a great performance. If you think Tina Turner is just ""okay"", you'll be a real fan after seeing her in concert in Amsterdam. Tina is full of energy, the dancers and musicians do a magnificent job, the camera work is exceptional, and the DTS sound is phenomenal. Among the best concert DVDs out there."
3,interesting period horror,"interesting period horror, appears to be trying the hammer method and failing. John Considine in pure Jon Lovitz ACTING!!!! mode"
3,Long time waiting...,"This movie is definitely to be loved or to be hatred, there's some malevolant little voice who saids , well maybe the ""selective reincarnation"" could be fun, !"
5,Good Read.,Book was a little hard to get started on but once into it was quite interesting. Written different than what I am ;used to
5,A Page Turner,"Ivan Doag has captured my attention. After reading this great adventure story, I intend to order more books written by this author. His ability to create dialogue and tell a fascinating tale is remarkable. My only wish is for a sequel."
4,Wild Alaskan adventure,"Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!"
4,Good Read,"An enjoyable survivalist tale, along the lines of ""The Long Walk"" or even Shackleton's ""Endurance."" Basically four workers escape an indentured work camp in Alaska, steal an Indian canoe and try to make it down the coast of British Columbia and what is now the state of Washington to make it to the settlement at the mouth of the Columbia River.The depictions of the water and scenery is good. The author spent some time researching the surroundings. The rough humor and tension between the men is hilarious. As they battled starvation during their journey my only question is why didn't they catch more fish, as that coastline is chock full of fish, but that's a minor detail. Love the scene where they get to witness a Northwest Indian tribe bring in a whale, as that is of historical significance. You'll feel an ache in your own back and blisters on your own hands as you empathize with their journey.First book of his that I've read, and I now want to find more."
4,Northwinds - 'Great God Pan' (Black Widow),"Northwinds seems to have a good share of originality to their sound.It might be sort of tough to describe their work,but I'll try.A French progressive outfit that blends old school Sabbath with celtic music.Would that formula even fly?It does here.Notice some truly inspired heavy guitar work along with some superb keyboard and flute playing on 'Great...'.A total of six cuts,with each one averaging eight minutes.Tunes I couldn't get enough of were the title track,""Great God Pan"",their Sabbath cover of ""A National Acrobat""(talk about covering an obscurity-great work!!)and the epic ""The Forest Of Koncerei"".A real keeper."
1,Pile of Junk - Save your money!,"The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work. The second one literally took 5 to 10 minutes to boot up. I returned it again to Discount Jungle (Amazon Seller) and they said they would not charge me the 15% restocking fee which they did anyhow.All in all, I wouldn't own another Sandisk MP3 even if they would give me one for free! I'm out $10.00 for two return shipments and another $10.00 restocking fee. Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different! Do a Google search for Sansa View slow start up, boot, or lockup.At least the FM Radio was nice....that's why it has a two star rating. I'd sure hate to see how well the re-manufactured units work."
1,SanDisk Sansa View Player MP3 Player - plays less than two hours,"While advertised as eight hours of play time, the player didn't make a two hour trip once in the three or four weeks we had it.Now just waiting to get the refund we've been notified we will receive so we can try something else, hopefully something that will live up to its advertisement this time."
1,cheap,"After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast. After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver. I'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead. I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, turn it off, then turn it back on and it would be at half power. Recently the screen broke. That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me, keep looking."
2,Overall problematic MP3 player,"I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines. The rewind bar doesn't work either! you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease."
1,not a good experience,"I bought a sansa view 8gb from Sold by: txxhenk, and i am not at all satisfied with this product. I just got the player, without a charger, how on the world should i charge this player without a charger. I also didn't receive the USB cable or the head phones or the user manual. I know that this is used-good condition but i didn't expect this."
1,Wow the battery life is bad!,"If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!"
1,Think twice about buying this player !,"I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !"
1,Sansa View 8 GB,"This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping. Imagine that!"
5,bithday gift,"it was a gift for my son he use to have the smaller version years ago . so, when i saw this i new he would enjoy it. thank you."
2,Not good,"Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music."
1,SanDisk MP3 Player,"Player was defective. After charging battery, I turn it on and while attempting to download an audio-book, the unit ""locked up"", All functions ceased, and I couldn't turn it off: back of player became very warm. Battery finally lost life and the unit shut down. One unsuccessful attempt was was made to recharge it. It was returned for refund.."
1,SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series,"This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."
2,Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.,"Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.When plugging an 8Gb external microsd all the media from sd card is displayed twice in Sansaview. Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W.If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items, I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view. After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos, the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the ""Previous"" button pressed in ""hold"" mode while connecting the cable to laptop."
3,nice device,the device menu takes a little to get used to. The battery life when connecting to an external music system is not good. This is because you have to turn the volume control 3/4 of max on the SansaView so the volume level is high enough on the external music system.
2,Good Product-when it lasted.,"This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on. I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode, never actually coming on. As long as I had it, it would frequently exhibit the same behavior. The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in. Finally in the end, that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa's line is poor at best."
5,Excelent product!,I definitely like this. All the features that has makes this product smooth and easy to operate.Definitely recommended.
1,Returned the View twice in one week,"I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend. Right out of the box, the player would not turn on because the power button was stuck. We tried everything but nothing would happen. The customer service people could not turn it on also, so we exchanged that one. The next one we received at least turned on. We went home to charge it and then tried to start loading media on. Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing. My boyfriend spoke to the customer representatives and had no luck. I have transferred music, video, and photos to my sansa e280 with no problems, but this player has many problems."
2,Horrible for long audio files,"The player is awful if you are using it to listen to lectures; it only recognizes 25 minutes of an mp3. Plus, the fast forward function is EXTREMELY slow (to fast forward 10 mins would take about 3-4 minutes of holding down the button).Otherwise, it plays music fine, though the software on the mp3 player is no where near as nice as what you get with ipods (e.g. if you pull the headphones out of the jack it will pause the file, or it will remember the exact location in a file where you last left off instead of restarting a file if you turn the player off), but on the flip side it is also significantly cheaper.Overall, you get what you pay for."
1,Did not work out of the box,"I got the View for Christmas for my daughter after her Sansa Fuze died after several years of heavy use. It would never charge right out the box using both the USB or the electric charger I have for my own Fuse. I went online and tried everything the sandisk site said-nothing worked. Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a ""Legacy"" item. Sent an e-mail and never got a response. Their customer service department needs a lot... of help. On the plus side, sent it back to Amazon who gave A+++ refund service. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Bad Luck?,"The Sansa View 8GB I received was faulty. The battery would not hold a charge and/or the player would not turn on. This happened within hours of opening the player packaging and attempting an initial full-charge of the player's battery. The battery is only chargeable via USB and I tried using a PC and an AC to USB adapter to charge it. There is no hard reset button like I have seen on other players (namely Cowon brand players) so it could not simply be reset.I decided to return the product for a refund because it did not seem worth the trouble of waiting for a new (or repaired) player. I was not very impressed with the build quality of the player. It felt and looked very prone to scratching or other damage if not treated with extreme care. Furthermore, I found another player that suited my personal needs and desires better than the Sansa View."
2,Not Happy,I recently purchased a used 8 GB View. It works well as a 8 GB View but will not support an 32 GB SD card. The literature on the internet said that it would support a 32 GB card.
2,ejects micro SD chip!,"I was very happy with my Sansa View, until all of a sudden my micro SD chip was missing. I couldn't imagine someone stealing just a chip, but then when I tried to put a new one in, I noticed it would only be installed for a second or two before the spring inside the unit would expel the chip. It would actually launch it up 4-6 inches! So now I know my original chip is somewhere at the gym, certainly vacuumed up by now.It's a great player, but check to make sure your SD card doesn't come out too easily or just send it back!"
4,One major criticism,"Mostly very happy with this product, except the fact that it's dreadfully slow on fast forward or reverse. As you might imagine this can become very frustrating at times. And also totally unable to skip ahead to another part of the recording immediately similar to what the ipod can do.---C'mon Sandisk, give us some software to correct these serious inconveniences!!"
3,decent player if you don't touch it.,"This player looks good, sounds good(when you get its eq settings right) and has expandable memory. Thats the good stuff. Its big color screen has a habit of locking up whenever you press a button. It will show album art of a previously played song,and the title shown may or may not be the correct one playing. It also likes to freeze up when you press a button rendering all further inputs inoperable till it unfreezes. It also likes to list all songs stored on the memory expansion card twice, and includes album art in with your pictures. I've downloaded every firmwire update and still have these problems. But, if you just leave it sit and play on shuffle mode it makes a fine jukebox."
5,"Sansa View 8GB, very nice little unit.","I bought it to use for taking my Unbox videos mobile. Great, clear little screen. Very easy to use, very easy to transfer media, very compatable with Unbox, Windows Media, Rhapsody and Yahoo Music (which will soon be Rhapsody, too). Can't load my photos on it, but I think that's more of a problem with my computer rather than the Sansa Media Converter. (It originally worked until I started messing a bit with it, and it was easy to use, too. Will fix the problem when I find the time. Until then, it's not a big deal.) Expansion slot is a big plus. The View automatically senses what media is being loaded and adjusts accordingly, a feature that is absent in the E250, which I also have. Great sound with the right earphones. Loads of space. What else can I say that hasn't already been said. I love my little View and hope it lasts a long time. Good price at Amazon, as always."
2,Nice player except.....,"Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore. The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure. I wouldn't recommend this (or perhaps any SanDisk product. This just SHOULD NOT happen."
2,if only it could last,"This was my first mp3 player so i didn't neccessarily want anything fancy, just something with a decent sized screen. It worked pretty good for about a year. Then it began to randomly turn off. Usually when this happened i could turn it back on within a few minutes but this too ceased happening. I've now had it close to a year and a half and it cannot hold a charge at all. This would be fine if I only wanted to listen to it while it was charging, however I prefer my mp3 player to be portable. Do not buy this unless you prefer temporary dependability out of your electronics."
1,Worst mp3 player on the market.,"I bought at the end of 2009 and have been meaning to leave a review ever since but have not done so on account of not having anything nice to say about this product. This is about the worst mp3 player on the market. Sound quality is so-so. I cannot create or save any playlists. The worst aspect of this player is the battery life. I charged it for one whole day and then when I disconnected it from the power source the battery bar immediately went to RED.Please, please do not waste your money & time on this product. I for one will never buy anythign that has the SanDisk name on it."
1,This device is the worst ever,if its not tranferring the wrong music... its freezing up.. or not liecening properly.. or the device itself sticks(dail to select with). this is my third sansa and will be my last
2,a Mac user,NOT at all friendly for a Mac user. The instructions are not at all helpful and tech services are not available on weekends.
1,De la poudre aux yeux,"J'ai acheté un Sansa View 16gB pour $200 CAD il y a deux ans et demie à peine, et la batterie vient de mourrir. L'estimation pour la réparation et le remplecement de la batteire est de $80 minimum, vous voyez le topo? Malgré son excellente sonorité, je ne recommande pas cet appareil, difficile à comprendre, parfois il gèle... à éviter!"
1,Frustrating,"Any problem listed in previous reviews, I encountered with mine. At which point I discovered one more weakness of this mp3 player.It does not fare well against a hammer."
1,Bad battery - not replaceable - throw away unit,"I recently received a refurbished View as a birthday gift, charged it up, set it down a couple of days. When I picked it up I found it was dead. I charged it again, called Sansa about the issue and they agreed it was a bad battery after diagnosing the problem. They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away. Now I need to deal with Buy.com to see if they will give me my money back or replace the unit hopefully with a e200 series. The e200 series has inexpensive replaceable batteries."
2,"Great player, bad job with the refurbish","We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players."
4,Works but has a few minor flaws,"I really like this MP3 player. I have downloaded many videos and about 400 songs on it and it still has plenty memory...with the help of a Micro SDHC 8MB card of course. Overall pretty good except.*Slow to rewind and fast forward*It freezes occasionally*instead of going to the next video, you have to manually select the next video when its done.*Would be nice if you could still listen to it while charging. Although you can if your computer is sleep, it will still charge."
2,OK but lots of bugs which never get fixed!,"I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers."
5,Great little mp3,"I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there."
1,Poor Qiality Control,"Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one, I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market. Wrong!!!!My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use. I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before. Amazon refers buyers to that vendor's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers."
2,I think I hate it,"I had high expectations for this player. I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought, being from Sandisk, it would follow suit. It didn't. Very disappointed with the sound quality. It even breaks up. And forget about organizing you music and videos. You can't create folders on your own. Have to use Windows Media Player. And I still haven't figured out how to make video playlists. WMP won't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist. Plus, when scrolling through your library, the scroll wheel only goes forward so, if you want to play a song that begins with ""Y"" and don't what to start from ""A"" and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to ""Y"" but want to scroll up from ""Z"" to ""Y"", you can't."
4,Good value for the money,"I purchased this mp3 player for my daughter who really likes it. She experienced some difficulty at first downloading her music, but this problem has been resolved.The player is very easy to use - she did not even need to read the manual."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this earlier this year, thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours ( by then the battery is drained) to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct. Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!"
2,disappointed with this MP3,"I purchased this MP3 player as a Christmas gift for our daughter only to find out on Christmas Day that is not compatible without our computer despite every update available. While we could see the preloaded video and it is very clear and bright, we were never able to upload any music. My husband (who is computer wizard) spent 12 hours trying to get this thing to work, but without any success. Next time we'll buy an IPod."
1,Has one important major flaw,"Had no luck, even with latest firmware, getting the unit to resume any of my audio books. I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work. The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time."
2,Be nice if it worked.,"Apart from arriving in nearly 2 pieces ( apart ) it did not work and the software did not work either. Going away in a week, so I cannot use it. Pissed off."
4,"A few kinks, but overall it works well","Unfortunately it hasn't been all wine and roses w/my View but overall I would say that I'm satisfied with it. After having to return my first view due to battery problems the second one I got has worked great. It has been reliable (so far) and it's a breeze to load w/my music, photos and short home videos. The sound is fine with a little tweaking and creating my own equalizer setting. The screen rotates to landscape to show videos so you get the widescreen view, albeit on a very small screen. The wheel works well to glide through the menu as well as volume control. It feels solid though definitely not noticeable on my arm when I'm working out."
4,Sansa e280,"Can not beat this item for the price, hands down!Excellent product with all the features you could want, period."
5,sandisk sansa,"I am proud that the item purchased on amazon, and therefore recommends to cybernauts to use and buy on Amazon because so far is a trusted site and find everything you need to this.SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)"
3,GIFT FOR DAD,I bought this for my dad and had no problems with it other than the fact that he couldnt get it to plug into his toyota scion. it works with all other adapters but for some reason wouldnt hook up w the toyota scion *SHRUG*
1,Don't buy without a good return policy.,This player freezes constantly. It's possible not everyone has this issue. Also the menus can be a bit sluggish. Don't buy without a good return policy.
5,Years of Knowledge,I loved this book. I am in the process of becoming a public speaker and wanted to be very affective with the people I speak to. This book helped me to make sure my workshop is designed in the correct order to teach from A to B rather than floundering around from one to another topic never smoothly progressing toward the ultimate goal. I am well on my way to become an excellent public speaker.
3,"Very good writing, bad book","This book is very well written and the best book one could find on public speaking. But this book is not useful. This book is as useful as a book that tells you how to be good at football or a muscial instrument. A book on how to be good at football or a musical instrument is useless because the only way to be good at those things is practice. The same goes for public speaking. This book would only be useful for someone who has years of public speaking experience. But for someone like me who has no public speaking experience, this book is useless and gets quite boring. This book is very well written and draws from a wealth of experience and anecdotes, but is only useful for somebody who has a wealth of public speaking experience."
2,public speaking book,I actually didn't finish this book. It had some good pointers within it but I felt it was doing more story telling than teaching me how to calm down and deliver a speech without my breakfest or lunch wanting to errupt. Although it was somewhat interesting it wasn't doing what I needed it to and that was to teach me not to want to disappear before I got up in front of a group of people.
2,good examples - no index,"Public speaking in narrative form. Lots of stories and examples from Lincoln to businessmen in 1969. Interesting to read. No index, not user-friendly as a resource."
2,Carnegie Aint what he used to be...,"Dale carnegie wrote very well in his earlier works, this later work (assumedly from later in his life, or judging from the text possibly written postumously) is the worst thing i have ever seen in print.As an english professor it seemed sardonic to me to see someone write so poorly about the topic of speaking well. Perhaps i should have read this garabage aloud instead."
1,Returned it,This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad
5,As Expected,It was what I expected it was and told me what I needed to know. It's a very worthwhile purchase
4,What can I say!,"I never took up any efective speaking book before. This would be my first. It has been very helpful and comes with examples that really boost your confidence. They let you see the bad, let you feel the good. Then you'll know what to follow and what not to. Recommended for shy speakers. -)"
2,Not what you're thinking,"I've read this book as well as Carnegie's 2 other books, How to Win Friends & Influence People as well as How to Stop Worrying & Start Living. This one was a let down after those two, which i highly recommend (even with the old school references).This book stated a lot of common sense but nothing that I found I could use in off-the-cuff talks. In fact it, discourages that. It's also a bit of a dry read.While I admire his other books, I did not like this one."
4,Rhomba is fine little player,"I just received the Rhomba 128M MP3 player and its quite a good value.Pluses -Recorder function also with FM radio.Nice displayLi-on Battery, good life between chargesWindows XP recognizes it as a drive, no need forspecial download software like the Rio players.NegativeFilmsy switching for track forward/backwardNo beltclipIncluded ear buds are totally useless and built for elephant size ears, you'll need to use another headphone.No expansion capabilityNeed a USB charger if you travel (these are about $10)I have used Rio MP3 players in the past (original MP300 parallel port, RioOne, S35S), but this is more functional."
1,Crashed within 3 hours of first use - needs new firmware !!,"This POS started giving ""English font only"" and ""download new firmware from ""www.creative.com"" within 3 hours of using it after it was fully charger. Creative has NO firmware upgrade for this model since it is so new, and support cannot help. Search for ""rhomba firmware"" at google and visit Creative's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they cannot recover from at all. People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it. *sigh* another bug-ridden thing from Creative. Going back for the iPod 10GB - $100 upgrade, but I am sure I will have NO problems making that thing work since it is an Apple."
1,Fragile,"This is a cute little gadget, but it got broken after only three months of carrying it in my pocket. Seems to be too fragile for being a mobile player."
1,Creative could be creative,"I bought this player for my nephew(age15) one year ago. After the first month it wouldn't work. called and they refused a new one, only rebuilt. OK. Sent it back and 4 1/2 months later it stopped playing again. They refused him any replacement, partial payment to fix it, no solution to the problem. I am sitting here with this $179.MP3 player that doesn't work, that I can now get for $119 and am not sure what to do with it. Do I throw it away, can it be fixed(again). I would not buy any Creative product again. EVER"
1,Don't buy this Product !!!!,"I read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet."
1,Don't buy this piece of crap,"I bought this piece of crap and found out it's not compatible with tracks which are downloaded in DRM (Digital Rights Management) format which 6 out of 6 songs I downloaded from Napster were in. So, I have basically a $200 radio. Worthless. DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,Excellent Product !!!,"It's surprisingly small which allows me to easily toss it in my pocket. Thus far I've downloaded about 50 songs and still have room for about 30-40 more. The only problem is finding the right place to download from. I avoid Kazaa due to its spyware/adware and virus problems. I currently use MusicMatch which works great with some extra work. I burn a cd first ( which I normally do anyway ), then I use the software that came with the Rhomba to burn from the cd to the Rhomba. There's probably and easier way but this works fine for me. I still recommend the Rhomba for people who are looking for a less costly mp3 player or for first time buyers of mp3s."
3,This has already increased my stress,"Jan 8: I opened it up, glanced at what I thought was the first page of the instruction manual and plugged this thing in. I think I permanently messed it up because I then noticed in the middle of the cover of the instruction manual it says in all caps ""warning do not plug device in until you install software.""Oh well so much for my Rhomba. Now I have to figure out what to do next. What a piece of junk.***Jan 12: OK-I let the battery drain, then plugged it in the next day and got it to work. Then when I finally figured out how to get songs transferred to it, I couldn't get them to play. I finally realized the problem was that I had copied them in a folder rather than directly.Bottom line, now that it works I really like it. But it is a pain and the documentation sucks. Not user friendly to set up, but awesome once it is working. Now I need more memory...."
4,Excellent biography!,"I, also, cannot understand why the first reader found this biography on Fredrick Douglass, racist. Personally, I found it completely the opposite. For the first time, I truly felt I understood the man behind the public image."
2,Big Dropoff,"There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it."
3,What a shame!,"I haven't bought either of these volumes yet, but what a shame the Beeb doesn't put out complete shows. Do I want to buy a disk where I don't care for maybe 1/3 of the content? No! For example, I have a DVD of Rory Gallagher on OGWT whose set is presented in its entirety and it blows me away.THAT'S how this material should be released!"
3,Not bad.,"I liked the first one better, but there's a few memorable performances on this volume. Roxy Music is fascinating to watch AND listen to. If you're suffering from ""complete-ism"" like I am, g'head and get it."
2,Not a good followup...,"The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted some incredibly groundbreaking FULL CONCERTS, two of which were the original Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Return To Forever (performing most of Romantic Warrior). Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers."
5,Another great book by Kin Platt!,"This is the sequel to Kin Platt's excellent mystery ""Sinbad and Me"". All the great characters are back: adventurous teenager Steve, his heroic bulldog Sinbad, girlfriend Minerva, her suspicious dad the Sheriff, Herk, all investigating goings on involving witches, mandrake root, and a deadly bracelet. What a great book! If you are ten on up, you'll love it! If you are an old person, you will still love it!"
4,No appetite...,This product does make the appetite disappear!! However it made me very irritable while I took it. I took it for four days so I did not give it enough time to see how the fat burning part worked. The pills were also very long and caused me throat irritation. Everyone is affected differently when taking things so I would say give it a try you will notice the effects right away.
2,Disappointed that I wasted my money,"After reading all the great reviews on this product on Amazon, I decided to go for this. I don't typically have good results from diet products, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I've been taking these for 3 weeks, as directed, and I might as well have been taking sugar pills for all the more this is doing for me. I felt like my appetite increased, I haven't lost any weight at all - in fact I've been fluctuating up and down 3 pounds for the past couple of weeks. I gave this two stars because I didn't feel the anxiety or sleeplessness that some people complained about, but I'm still disappointed. I was hoping I'd find something that actually worked!"
2,Green Tea,"Well, it arrived on time and in OK condition, but after almost a month of taking it, I haven't noticed any change, except now I have stomach cramps."
3,So So,"I own several Sioux air tools and consider them to be very good quality. This right angle grinder seems to be only average quality. It isn't as smooth as I would like it to be. Be sure to purchase a mini grease gun along with this tool if you don't already have one. The head of this grinder came almost empty of grease. It's still a good tool as long as you don't pay too much for it. Expresstools.com has the best price I've found. All my other Sioux air tools I'm very happy with. This one, I'm just ""ok"" with it."
1,Not at all good,"This book is filled with recipes using brand-name adulterated products that contain large amounts of additives, preservatives, artificial flavors, colors, trans-fats, bland flavors and also cost a lot more then scratch foods.If you believe boiling potatoes, using fresh vegetables or measuring flour unthinkable, by all means this book is right up your alley...."
5,Wonderful Recipes for a Quick and Healthy Meal!,Another great purchase of the Sandra Lee cookbooks to add to my collection. Recipes so quick and easy to prepare. ~ Thank you Sandra Lee for making cooking enjoyable again for women everywhere!
3,semi-homemade cooking,This book did not live up to the expectations from the TV show. I expected more of the Sandra Lee personality and comments in it. Recipes were not the simple every day ones she usually does on the show.
1,"Trailer Home Cooking, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Recipes on the Back of Pre-Packaged and Canned Garbage","Why, why, why? This woman is a talentless hack. I've seen better recipes on the back of soup cans! Sandra Lee's approach to inspired cooking is to add a can of tomatos to your Hamburger Helper! Woo! Seriously, though, this is a joke. I have nothing against easy cooking, but this is an absolute waste of time and money."
3,There is a place for Sandra Lee,"My mom bought this book for me and I read through some of the comments that people posted here (both positive and negative). As a working mom with a toddler I have to admit that the ease of these recipies is what appeals to me. I like that Sandra Lee offers brand name items to purchase and that many of her recipies are not labor intensive. Do I wish she used more vegetables and fresh ingredients. . . sure. But I also know that I can substitute those in on my own.Initally I liked that there was a section of kid friendly recipies but this became my big disappointment in the book. Many of her kid recipies are deep fried and I have NO INTENTION of frying food for my child (nor do I own a deep fryer). For many reasons, the biggest of which being that it is simply unhealthy. There is a place for fried food in cooking but I don't think that place is with kids. In this regard, I wish she has provided modifications for baking some items instead."
3,You've never used canned tomato paste?,"I flipped through this book recently and was pleasantly surprised at what I found. Sure, the brand names are gimmicky, so use your favorite tomato paste, or your favorite refridgerated pasta instead. Come on...do you always make pancakes from scratch? Hello? Is someone a bad person because they don't make lasagna noodles from scratch ALL the time?I'm a purist by nature. Cake mixes make me gag, but there is a place for this just as there is a place for my personal hero, Julia Child. And sure, I'm not going to use Kraft Mac & Cheese as the base for something...but there's a balance here and you pick and choose. This book isn't meant for organic types, nor is it meant for vegans, vegetarians, and so on. It's still a heckuva lot better than a boxed meal (just empty into a casserole dish and bake). Now THAT's something to have a heart attack over :)"
3,Advertising,"This book really isn't about eating on a budget or nutritious food. The way I see it, it is all about advertising. While this may have changed with the 2nd release of the book, the first release is just pages of her brand loyalties. Do we really need to use her brand recommendations for butter? Or saltines? Come on!I bought this cookbook with the hopes of finding new recipes that I could cook on the quick but I didn't end up finding anything worth making. While my boyfriend was drawn to a few recipes, we decided that none were worth the nutritional suicide.I would definitely consider checking her books out again if she started showing interest in healthy eating but, in the meantime, I'm sticking with the other Food Network personalities."
5,great cookbook,this is one of sandra lee's best ever. The recipes are easy to make and best of all delicious.
5,One of the best,"Good variety of recipes, complete with brand names and suggestions....pictures are gorgeous. Good for the new or experienced but busy cook."
1,Not a practical book,This oversized book does not lie flat unless you are using a recipe from the center pages. I tried cans and a rolling pin to weigh down the pages and nothing worked. The money spent on the endless photographs (do we really need to see a photo of empty cd boxes?)and the pre paid reply postcard ... would have been better spent on a smaller hard covered book that would be easier for home cooks to use....
5,Semi-Homemade,"I love this book! Its such a fresh concept, especially for a full time working mother of 3. Full of great time saving ideas!This is a great christmas gift for people who love to cook, but dont necessarily have the time."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"I do not think I am exagerating when I write that this woman has created an empire in which she is enabling people to become seriously overweight and possible worse health problems. This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes. Check the labels; if you see chemicals, don't eat it! If you care about your health, you will stay clear of Sandra Lee."
1,Advertising,"It is one brand name after another, don't waste your money.<br />This book has more fluff then recipes that you can use everyday, plus it will not save you money with all the package and can food you have to search out and buy."
1,Outdated already!,"I went to two stores trying to find the exact brand name products that Sandra Lee insist we use. Frustrated, I asked the store mananger who told me that the products I was looking for, Campbell's fat-free mushroom soup and Jello refrigerated vanilla pudding cups are no longer available in my area.Why make such a big fuss about using this or that brand when they aren't even available? I won't waste any more time travelling around town looking for the exact brand names needed to make the recipes in this book.I have better things to do! Maybe this book needs a ""use-by "" date before even more products become obsolete."
4,Grade A in my book,"I am a college student. I can't afford many cookbooks because they're expensive but Amazona[.com] had this one at a good price. I am graduating in the spring and need to learn how to cook so I thought this book would help me ease my way into it. Now that I've tried it I doubt I will cook any other way. Its just too easy. I can fix an entire meal, clean up the kitchen and still have time to go out or do something afterward. I would have to give it a definite A."
3,Mainly An Overview,"This book is mainly a fast overview of the Northwest/Seattle music scene in the late 1980's. In fact, it reads more like a long magazine article than a book. Not to say that it's ""bad"", it just moves very quickly from one thing to the next without going into any depth. For the first half of the book Nirvana is in it, but just as part of the scene, not as the main focus. It talks about Soundgarden, The Melvins, and other bands, and talks about the punk scene. Later on in the book it does focus more on Nirvana, but that part has to do with drugs, Kurt's burn-out, Courtney Love, feuds, etc., and not much about the music itself. It is a fairly interesting, fast read if you don't know much about the Seattle scene from that era, but for anybody who knows the music scene from that era fairly well it probably won't tell them much they don't already know."
4,"Very thorough, easy reading!","This book is informative on all aspects of partial seizure disorders, from discovery to diagnosis and treatment. I loved how easy it was to read. I read this book in less than 2 days! My only disappointment is that the book didn't touch a little more on the psychological impact of the disorders (and subsequent consequences)."
4,A quick read....,.......with basic factual info. A must have if you were recently diagnosed with partial seizures.
5,The best and most comprehensive report of the Manson murders,Who better to write a book on the Manson family murders than the prosecutiing attorney. Vincent Bugliosi captures what actually happened during those two nights in 1969. Through testimony of his witnesses he gets eye-witness truths abouy Manson and his family. The best book I've ever read.
3,Bait & Switch,"The subtitle of this book, ""The True Story Of The Manson Murders"", is a bit of a misnomer. This is really the true story of Vincent Bugliosi, the investigation of the Manson murders and the subsequent trial. Manson, the Family and the murders are supporting players here. There is alot of detail in this 700 page book and, again, most of it has to do with gathering evidence and boring courtroom semantics. Certainly Bugliosi should be commended on all the work he did, but I don't need to know aboout it. It was exhausting for him; it shouldn't be for me. There is some interesting interaction between Bugliosi and Manson, but it is very brief. I read this book hoping to learn more about Manson because he is strange and interesting. Bugliosi, as a subject (sorry, Vince) is just not very strange or interesting."
5,Helter Skelter,"I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be."
5,I could not put this book down...,"I found this book very interesting and disturbing. It's all the details you would want to know about the Charles Manson case.To think that one man could convince people to carry out such horrendous crimes. That he had such skill in story telling and making people follow him blindly. I enjoyed reading all the details of the case and how evidence would come up and start up new leads. Bugliosi did an excellent Job of walking us through the crime, and all the way through to the Trial.I could not put the book down. It's a definite page turner, and has many photo's of the victims, the killers and the evidence. Not for the squeamish, very detailed."
1,The plague that this book has caused.,"Have any of you not read the Manson File? It is obvious that you cannot control people with LSD, and it is obvious in the fact that Manson did not kill anyone."
1,Too bad the book is completely fiction...,"The fact of the matter is this book is total fiction, the elaborate work of Vincent Bugliosi's imagination due to due his ignorant and superstitious ""ideology"".He needed to give ""evil"" a face... and Manson was convenient.""Helter Skelter"" has made Bugliosi wealthy beyond belief.I guess whatever sells a book, right? Charles Manson, a human being... was simply collateral damage."
1,the classic pulp novel is still selling fast,"Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of ""trying to start a race war"". There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case."
4,"Helter Skelter is a stone cold, but true book.","This is an in your face account of the Manson family murders. Brought to you straight from the courtroom as Vince Bugliosi, the prosecuter who tried Manson and his ""family"", tells you this horrific story piece by piece. Complete with a photo album of the killers and their victims. How did Charles Manson make these people kill for him? What was the motive for all these murders? The cold, but true answers are told in ""Helter Skelter"""
5,Helter Skelter,"Fantastic! I have read this book twice. I love the way the author narrates the real life drama of these murders, murderers and inefficiency of the LAPD. It is probably one of the scarriest books I have read so far. The author does a great job of explaining the psychological influences of Charles Manson and the crazy/hipnotic behavior of the Manson Family. He also paints a very clear picture of the long and difficult trial and the obstacles that needed to be overcome to convict Manson and his followers. It's a very interesting book from a psychological and legal stand point. I probably will read it again some time soon because the second time around helped me understand even more, the real-life occurences and legal complexities of this case."
5,One of the best true crime stories ever written,"In the begining of the book it reads ""This book will scare the hell out of you"" and was that ever an understatement. Charles Manson and his crew will always be the ultimate in evil. The only time you will put this book down is to sleep, that is, if you can."
5,Made a great gift!,"My husband has always wanted to add Helter Skelter into his book collection and today he opened it as a Christmas gift. It's four hours later and he's still reading it, pausing every now and again to tell me some other disturbing connection that was made between music and the murders. This was his perfect gift!"
5,"Good, but just one objection your honor!","This is a fascinating account of the Manson case from the eyes of prosecution attorney Vincent Bugliosi. Well paced, haunting, somewhat grissly, but suprisingly quite funny in places- (the defense attorney made over two hunderd objections on the first three days of the trial!). A real pager turner probably best read in the daytime so it won't give you nightmares. One quible though I feel the author has grossly misinterpreted the philiosophy of Friedrich Nietzche by affilating his philiosophy with the spread of Nazism. Yes Hitler (who shared with Manson many characteristic's; they were both loved animals more than humans, each a vegetarian, and had spent time as an ""outsider"" living on the fringes of society) had read his work. Yet those documents he read were greatly adulterated under the cursed hand of the authors sister, who, after the philosophers death re wrote his manuscripts to fit Nazi ideals in the hope of courting parties leader..."
3,Don't Take this Book so Seriously,"Helter Skelter is a book about Charles Manson and the Manson murders. It was written by the DA who prosecuted Manson. There is a lot of interesting information in this book regarding the crimes and the weird court events that followed.But as a book review, I'll have to say that the book was so-so. Some people's reviews are a little over the edge (i.e., are too caught up in how they ""feel"" about the whole ordeal).Bottom line: Interesting piece of history done moderately well."
2,Kindle version of this book is NOT coimplete,"Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format."
5,"A scary, captivating tale","This book is certainly not a Pulitzer prize winner, but it is definitely a must read for any true-crime fans. I found myself unable to put the book down for hours. Bugliosi carefully unwinds the horrific details that surround these infamous murders. This book is much more than a gruesome exploitive account. I found myself understanding the late sixties as the tumultuous period that could host this episode in history."
5,America's best prosecuting attorney is also a great author.,"This is an excellent book on one of the most horrific crimes ever committed even by today's standards. The research, details, and explanations are absolute top-notch. It is evident that Vincent Bugliosi is one the greatest prosecuting attorneys ever to step into the courtroom. The way he can rationally reconstruct the events of a crime and get into the heads of the criminals and lay out their motives is just amazing. The courtroom drama is re-created in dramatic detail so you can feel the tension, suspense and horror all throughout the trial. We also learn alot about cult psychology and how people can be driven to extreme bahavior. What's even scarier is that there are people in this world like Charles Manson's fanatical followers ready to do his darkest bidding."
5,Most interesting,This book by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best book I have ever read. The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money
4,"Good for the story itself, not the writing","This book is endlessly fascinating because the Manson story is endlessly fascinating and because Bugliosi (the prosecutor) and Curt Gentry (the real writer) manage to avoid sensationalism. But it's really a pedestrian work, eminently readable, but nowhere near the level of Capote (In Cold Blood) or Mailer (The Executioner's Song)."
5,Outstanding writing,"Mr. Bugliosi has been able to make us feel we were there throuhtout this nightmare. This book will keep you on your toes, wondering if you locked all doors at night. For those who had not been born yet like me, is testament that that crazy idiotic losers have been present is every generation, williwng to do the unthinkable. The skills and genious shown on behalf of Bugliosi during this trial is enough to make anyone want to achieve excellence, no matter what the field of expertise may be."
5,One of my all time favorite books,"I ordered this book to read on a road trip because I have always been interested in true crime stories.This book, of all the true crime books that I have read, was by far the most gripping and interesting. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book, and I had a hard time putting it down.Even if you do not care for true crime stories, this book is so shocking and well documented. I have since read several books about the Manson family and Tate- La Bianca tragedies and this book is the best out of them all.I strongly recommend reading this book."
5,One of the most harrowing crime stories ever...,"I first read ""Helter Skelter"" the same summer I read ""In Cold Blood."" Both books left indelible images in my psyche and ensured I would never look at the world of crime and investigation the same again.I've never read a book quite like HS since. Bugliosi and Gentry have written a taught and gripping blow-by-blow account of the two seemingly unconnected streams of events, the Tate/La Bianca murders and Manson's cult, how they horribly intersected and the breathtaking resolution.Bugliosi's reminiscences provide both the personal anguish that the investigation caused him and his family and the urgent immediacy that gripped him and the community to see that justice was finally done.Unforgettable and unflinching, ""Helter Skelter"" forces us to look into the eyes of evil and learn more about ourselves.See also my reviews of the ""Helter Skelter"" TV movie and the audio book version."
4,A truly gripping book on an almost gripping person...,"The book Helter Skelter by Vince Bugliosi is perhaps one of the best tru-crime books I've ever read. From the story itself, to the incompetency of the LAPD; from the chilling descriptions of the murders to the way the book is set out, you just can't put it down. It's amazing how clsoe to Manson and his three co-defendants Bugliosi gets. If you're interested in true-crime stories, and even if you're not, this is a book to read, if simply to find out how horrifyingly brutal and cold humans can be.4 Stars, and don't forget to check out the photos."
3,Overrated,I found it disturbing but also overrated. I would not read it again. I would not recommend it to anyone. I pray something like this never happens again. Now let's forget about it.
3,Heltewr Skelter,"I bet Vincent never thought people would one day have home computers and be able to read the police reports and see the blood evidence because once you do that, you quickly find the book is complete B.S. The crimes could have never taken place as described by Vince. Manson was railroaded and believe me when I tell you I'm no fan of Charlie's but it is true, he was railroaded. Manson is doing life in prison from a story that is a complete lie. Man, what a country we live in when a person can become a millionaire by using the vicious murders of 7 people and no one challenges him. You should be ashamed of yourself Bugliosi. Only in America."
1,bad book,it is literally a step by step account of the investigation of the whole Manson murders. I have never been more bored with a book in my entire life.
4,Great ballads.,"Very nice playing, especially on the ballads like ""I Got it Bad..."" ""Your Love Has Faded"" and ""Day Dream."" Hodges' solos on these tracks are achingly pretty and Strayhorn's arrangements are elegant."
4,Ellington à la Strayhorn,"A recent documentary has noted that it is difficult to distinguish the respective compositional arrangements of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, so in sync were they in understanding the men of the orchestra and their sound. Perhaps. I have long suspected that Strayhorn soon became the dominant arranger, and this album of well-known Ellington works retooled by Strayhorn may prove the point, though the synergy was probably superior to either's contribution. Aside from such academic conjecturing, this album is outstanding. Johnny Hodges' saxophone is at the fore, with his smoothed-out Bechet melodic lilt. ***** for him! There is a soft, relaxed spirit throughout, evident in Jeeps Blue's and even Juice-a-Plenty. A caveat is that Jimmy Jones is at the piano, so do not expect the minimalism of Ellington or the sensitivity of Strayhorn. The high resolution digital mastering makes this 1961 setting as sharp as a tack. This is a very fine addition to the Ellington collection."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD I hate it!","I do not recommend it, I developed a bad break of acne in my body specially by the stomach and back, the second day of using.Still have the scars and they look like I got chicken pox, I totally regret buying this cleanser.After my acne break out, I looked over the internet for reviews and most of them were bad too. (like people developing hives and ezcema break outs.)"
2,Quit working after 3 hours,"The adapter quit working after 3 hours of use. I returned it and got a full refund. The customer service for the return and refund was excellent, and I would not hesitate to deal with this company again. But I won't buy any replacement power adapter for a 4-year-old laptop again. I got a new laptop."
5,Fierce Eden (The Louisiana History Collection),Fierce Eden (The Louisiana History Collection) ~ Another great collection by Jennifer Blake. A Real attention getter. If you like historical romances you will love this collection. I had trouble putting this one down.
5,Fierce Eden,"well written, lots of historical info about a period of history that are not too well known. characters were believable, good descriptions of places and time period. was a page turner, sorry when it ended, loved the characters."
2,too long and boring read,"This book is too long and the story too convoluted to be enjoyable. I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the ""gentleness and thoughtfulness"" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it."
2,Kind of boring,I thought the characters in this story had no real depth and the story was a little slow and boring. It seemed like no matter what happened all they wanted was to have sex. That got old really fast. I was looking for a good story line and strong characters.
5,Best Toy for my 8 year old son,"I love this toy for my son. He spends so much time manipulating it and discovering all that it is capable of. This is really his best toy ever. It is a bit difficult to assemble the tanks and green rings, but oveall I highly recommend this toy.Hydrodynamic Deluxe Building Set"
1,would be good if only there were directions,"This kit has a building diagram for only 1 project and that diagram was so poor that my husband who played with these kkits as a kid in the 60s (yes they have been around that long) couldn't easily figure it out - and he rarely has trouble figuring out anything. Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality. It is a pity, really, since it would take the manufacturer little work to produce a variety of projects with real instructions. I encourage the manufacturer to do so."
1,Impossible to use,"I bought this for my 10 year-old son. He's an experienced builder, having put together many lego creations and k'nex kits with little or no help from a grownup. He couldn't assemble the tanks. The green collars that are used to connect tank sections are very tight (to keep water in, I suppose), and he just didn't have the coordination or strength to push them together. I was able with much, much effort, to get two sections of a tank connected, but I couldn't even get the top on.I called the help number and left a message. So far, no response.The girders are also not very well designed and come apart with a little jostling.I wish I'd never bought it. My son really, really wants to see it work and so far we've spent many hours to no avail."
4,4 1/2 stars of fun .,"for something off the beaten track, here's an extremely fun cd of music composed between 1971 and 1980 for various projects, including: some rejected tracks for a TV show in switzerland (1978), three tracks from an experimental film about an evening in the life of a striptease dancer (also 1978), an electronic work for a trade exhibition in basle (1971), theme music for a successful swiss tv quiz show (1972), music for a PR-disc made for an iron-foundry company (1972), more PR music for a company called ""lansing-bagnall"" (1971), and finally, music from a documentary film about an art exhibition in zurich (1980). lots of synths, keyboards, and electronics throughout. and it is all fun stuff. highly recommended for those who like something different."
4,EXCELLENT AND A HALF-- 4 1/2 STARS,"This is an absolutely facinating specimen released by wierdo psych crate digger Andy Votel. Bruno Spoerri creates the beuatiful 70s synth cheese Votel just loves to reissue.Cheese usually has a negative conotation, but here, it perfectly describes the punchy confections Spoerri creates. If you can imagine Giorgio Moridor's 1970s work without the electronic syncronazation and a more improvosational approach, this is what this sound like. It contains danceable passages, but also goes deep into space, with synthasizer bloops and blips.It all amounts to a funk psych bass synth dance party that is impossible not to revel in. That fat juicy funk that you imagine when you think of the 1970s is on full display, and listening is like biting into an oh so groovey creampuff.Enjoy. Eat too much of this yummy stuff."
2,Surprisingly disappointing,"A book with a promising premise and a very cool cover (which was why I bought it, I must admit). Unfortunately, the picture on the cover has very little to do with the actual story. The storyline is plodding and uninspired. Character development leaves much to be desired. The conclusion is weak and muddled. The first person perspective does not mesh well with the story. The illustrations are somewhat cheesy, and don't really add anything to the story. I really wanted to like this book, but ultimately I came away very disappointed."
3,Middling Sci-Fi,"This is another of the first sci-fi books I read when I was a kid, and at the time I was too young to realize how mediocre the book was. In any case, it details the odd adventure of a father and son who operate a caravan on an untamed planet (complete with a nearly sentient, planet-wide jungle). Not surprisingly, those who run such freight services are referred to as ""voorlopers,"" hence the title."
2,Not Happy,"I am a complete Sudoku addict and am very disappointed with this book. The only reason I bought it was because I was desperate for more puzzles and it was the only one available at the store I was in. First of all, it costs $4.99 which to me, is way too much money when you can get a Kappa book for $1.99 which has better puzzles. Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help! But unfortunately, this book has quite a few errors in the answer section so when I've hit a dead end, it's over.I would recommend Kappa books from your local supermarket. This simply costs too much money for not mush quality."
4,Good quality,"They were very good quality, but they are very large. They would be good for kids, but for adults that want to hold their cards they are very bulky."
5,great for card players,"Works well, especially for arthritic hands. Use it once a week with group I play cards with and having more fun due to less hand pain."
4,Helping Hand,The card holder works better than most. Easy to use. The only problem is adding more cards once the holder has about fifteen in it already. Tends to be a little tight.
2,It does the job,"If you can't hold the cards, this will work but I believe they lost sight of their purpose and are trying to address a problem from outside the box. The idea is to make it easier for the individual. It can be difficult to get the cards in place and then change their positions defeating the fundamental purpose. A block of wood will do better. The card holder shouldn't be a game within a game."
5,LOVED THEM,"All of us girls loved the card holders. It did have an odor, but I sprayed them with Fabreeze and let them dry, then washed with soap and water and let them dry again. After that all was fine. We find that we even use them when we have 3 cards left. You can set it on the table and it leaves your hands free for important things--like snacks!"
5,Boon to Boomers,"So, if along with inheriting your Mom's Roseville, you also got her arthritic hands, you'll want to check out these nifty card holders. No more achy palms after a hot Canasta hand, no more spilling the cards while sorting, no more locked thumbs......and you can even play relatively hands-free!The Games Dames (of the NC Piedmont Triad) love these little things."
5,Perfect for a ten year old,I bought this for my ten year old daughter so she could play canasta with her grandmother. Her little hands did not allow her to hold all the cards. With the card holder she enjoys the game a lot more. I think they are grooming her as a substitute in the Canasta league!
1,Don't buy,"What ever you do don't buy this product. It not only came in used but beaten to death. It was scratch, dented and chipped. This is my 4th time writing a review on this product all other attempts have be block like I suspect this one will be to."
3,Good product,If you have problems holding cards in your hand this is theperfect product for you. It holds the cards really well.
1,Watch the price,I bought this from the same co. before christmas and was stunned that the price had doubled. On the page the price was not clear!
5,National treasure,What an incredible compendium. I would like to see the US create something similar to Japan's Cultural National Treasure and Robert Frost would certainly be included as such.
5,The complete Frost- The road not taken,"For most of us most poets live through a few poems of theirs we have read in anthologies. It may be that in the case of a poet we especially love we have gone and read most of their poetry.This volume presents a wonderful opportunity for the devotees of Frost to have in one book the work of a lifetime.For me Frost is ""The Road Not Taken"" and ""Birches"" and ""Mending Wall"" and a host of scattered lines, "" Good fences make good neighbors"" and "" The land was ours, before we were the land's"".Frost is also however, I must admit , for me the poet whose life casts a shadow on his work. Unfortunately perhaps I long ago read parts of the Thompson biography of Frost the central theme of which was his inveterate cruelty to all those around him.All this has left me, you will excuse this, a bit 'cool toward Frost' and I personally prefer the more musical metrics of Wallace Stevens to the canny, often pithily wise lines of Frost."
3,Not a Tribute to the GREAT writer,"I was sadly very disappointted by this book. The postive light is that Robert Frost's works are there and as always wonderful. Yet the contents and way that the book is actually set up is very confusing. It has no index and the contents is blantently wrong. Their is no order to where the works are and poems, plays and stories are mixed in amongest one another. I would recommend to all that they read Robert Frost yet certainly not in this frustraiting fashion."
5,Frost rehabilitated,"Jay Parini's ROBERT FROST: A LIFE, 1999, may rehabilitate somewhat the view of Frost as terrible person, presented in Lawrence Thompson's earlier biography. See Parini, pp.452 ff. Some reviews may tend to discourage reading Frost, because of Thompson's jaundiced portrait.This wonderful, copious collection of Frost contains many of his best poems, which do not show up in popular anthologies. And his prose is filled with wit and wisdom you might not suspect. A great contribution to our Art and our humanity."
5,crowsfoot tools,"never thought i would need these, but they have come in handy numerous times since i bought them. quite well made."
1,OOPS! WRONG BOOK!!,"This book reads like a dervative of a badly written derivative of Tolkien, married to the son of ""Dark and Stormy Night."" The annual contest of Groaner openings needs a new entry, maybe that way, FtM could get recognized! Books should be FUN to read, this one is a chore. I have tried three different times to pick it up, but have failed miserably. My last attempt died after less than a chapter. One of the other reviewers used the word ""Execrable,"" if he hadn't, I would have.I haunt my local Half Price Books and snap up anything by my list of favorite authors that appears on their shelves. Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK! I am not ready to give up on Flint, so I will blame his partner for the miserable writing. I don't think I will read any more of Roach's work."
2,Pass On This One,"For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with. If you REALLY feel you must read MAGE then check it out of your local library, but don't turn it in late, it's not worth the fine!This book is NOT RECOMMENDED!"
2,A device grows old,"Related to the Philosophical Strangler. Stories overlap, but this book focuses on Gwendolyn, Benvenutti & the Sorcerer. Story of events in these characters' lives before, during, and after, Phil Strangler. Found the language a bit much to wade through a second time, and not as funny. If you loved Philosophical Strangler, you'll probably love this one, but if you were growing weary by the end of the Strangler, you should probably pass this one up."
4,Good movie,This movies great it follows the way thru a whole downhill season. Ups and down til the final race with a nail bitter the whole way. Check it out if you love downhill it worth it.
3,Interesting French Horn Music,"Fans and performers of French horn music will enjoy the Rhapsody and Rondo for Horn and Orchestra. This is a show piece, exhibiting all the techniques and acrobatics that a horn can do. But it is also pleasant, exuberant music to listen to, and is well performed here. It was written originally for Dennis Brain, and Marco Polo deserves the thanks of the French horn community for preserving this work. You won't find any other recordings of this horn piece, and this one is well worth owning."
3,Take note...,"It should be noted that this book does not contain any information on the planes found in the video games (Crimson Skies (Jewel Case)andCrimson Skies). I bought it hoping to find schematics/profile views of those planes so that I could build an RC model. Unfortunately, this book is really only useful to fans of the miniatures game or those who are fans of the Crimson Skies universe in general. Still an interesting read, but I was disappointed."
2,Found it Irritating,"Though the book had some good plot points, I found the overall tone offensive. Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias. I will not be wasting my money on any more of his books."
3,Minor political satire dressed up as SF,"VOYAGE FROM YESTERYEAR depicts a libertarian utopia coming into contact with a sort of neo fascist, conservative American dream gone awry. Hogan sets up his premise with a fairly standard SF storyline, and uses this platform to explore this political drama. I was disappointed, however, because too little time was spent in this exploration. Instead, Hogan's story ends up as a fairly uninspired SF actioner with a wholly predictable ending. Still, entertaining if not engrossing. Somewhat reminiscent of L. Neil Smith's PALLAS."
1,This book could have been good.,"The book starts out well, but the author's explanation of social evolution contradicts the biological evolution Hogan likewise promotes in this book. This story could have been good other than the author's scientific and semi-moralistic inserts. At some points I had the feeling that he was trying to rationalize his own beliefs by authoring them in the book almost separate from the story."
5,Pure science fiction,"One of the foundations of SF is examining the consequences of science and technology on society. Here Hogan creates two diametrically opposed societies - those of Earth founded on limited resources and those of the newly colonized planet Chrion having unlimited resources. You won't find deep character development in this book, the focus is on the effects of technology on society - what we can become. Telling the story from the viewpoint of solders on the second colonization starship traveling and landing on the planet Chrion, Hogan explores his vision of what humanity can be. Chrionians value and trade respect, possessions are in abundence and free from automated factories. On the second colonization starship traveling from a militarized Earth, imagine the consequences to those powers to be when character matters! Unlimited resources you ask? Hogan postulates, the mind is a unlimited resource."
4,Worth the money,"Interesting dvd with some hard-to-find footage and interesting interviews. Must have for any Burdon/Animals fan; however, I was a little bummed that no full-length performances/songs were included. Also, the video primarily focused on the two incarnations of The Animals and Burdon's time with War was very quickly glossed over. :( All in all though, this was a great dvd and I recommend it."
3,Transfigured? Not!,"I adore Messiaen's music but somehow this work doesn't hit the mark with me. It seems too episodic... Yes I know that Messiaen's music is built from juxtaposing blocks (say, birdsong solo on piano, stately gorgeous chords from the orchestra, etc) and this works well with the ensemble & orchestral pieces. So perhaps it's something to do with this being the first choral piece written since the Cinq Rechants. I can't put my finger on it (perhaps I am looking for a narrative flow) but the cumulative effect just doesn't happen here for me despite all the symmetry and symbolism of 7.However I cannot fault the gorgeous sound or the committed performance here, but I think I prefer to turn to his massive opera St Francis of Assisi for spiritual nourishment, and for a better example of Messiaen's vocal and choral writing."
2,Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships,"This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a ""Nimitz""-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a ""great"" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book."
4,it's all happening here,"this c.d is pretty kool it got all the latest hits out, in one so u won't need to buy another c.d this winter. i would recomened this to everyoneso get off ur bum and buy it now"
4,Fit is execellent.,"Used these to replace the painfuly uncomfortable original earpads on my Samsung WEP200 Bluetooth headset and they're a tremendous improvement. Great that they include small, medium and large pads to ensure custom like fit. If not for these I wouldve had to chuck the earpiece in the garbage. They obviously won't fit every device out there so you maybe taking a gamble."
1,Glad they were under ten bucks.,"Save your money. The eargels split in two days. I used regular ear buds on the large size. They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping. I have no use for them."
3,They didn't fit on my jabra like i thought they would,"It's probably more my fault than the fault of the product, but i couldn't get them to fit on my jabra"
1,Eargels,They don't stay on the bluetooth...when they do stay on they work great! So I feel like I wasted my money :-(
3,Jabra eargels are all to big for the average size ear.,"I bought these eargels thinking that with 3 different sizes, one would fit a normal size ear. It turns out that all 3 sizes in the package are too large and the headset does not stay in place but keeps falling out. I have had friends and family try them with the same results. the description should read medium, large and extra large. I f you have a normal to smaller ear don't bother with these."
4,They work fine,"They work fine, keep the Jawbone firmly in the right place, and are almost comfortable. There are 6 in the package: 3 sizes each for left and right ear. I was surprised that the one that worked for me is the large one (no, i don't have gigantic ears!) :0) so try them all on until you find one that works.With the Jawbone, put the small plain rubber ring on first, then the eargel goes over the ring."
5,Great ear piece adapter,"The Jawbone bluetooth headset is a great little device, but unfortunately, none of the supplied ear pieces fit comfortable in my ear. I was all ready to return it, when I decided to try these Jabra EarGels. Well, I got them yesterday, and they make a world of difference. The Jawbone now comfortable fits in my ear, the little piece that is supposed to be touching my cheek is doing so. In fact, it is such a good fit I don't even need the other-the-ear hook any more!The EarGels come in three sizes, and are designed to fit the contours of your ear - not just to be shoved in an held in my force. Why JawBone themselves don't make something like this to come with the headset is beyond me, but at least Jabra stepped up to fill the void!"
1,"Junk,Don't wast your money.","I got these in hope It would give me a good fit to my jawbone 2, but they did not work for me. I think they even made it less of a fit."
4,These work pretty well,"I have small ears, so the only one I can use is the small, and it is still not small enough. But the only way I can wear my bluetooth is with the Jabra eargel. So they work pretty good!"
3,JABRA EARGELS,"PRODUCT OK--HOWEVER I ORDERED THE WRONG THING, SO IT DOES NOT FIT MY BLUETOOTH EAR PIECE."
3,Jawbone 2 W / eargels,"I ordered the eargels for my Jawbone 2 bluetooth, the product was good, but I didn't like the way the Jawbone sat on my ear. The eargels worked great, not needing the ear loops, but with the eargel adaptor in my ear, it pushed the bluetooth out, and I thought it looked wierd."
3,Jabra EarGels - Clear,"Good product after I figured out how to use them. Works very well with the Samsung WEP200 headset. Came with no labels i.e., left, right, etc. or instuctions so took a little while to figure out how they would work. A small piece of paper with a few pictures and labels would have helped out tremendously. If my impatient son or daughter would have bought them they would have returned them as unuseable."
2,Not for my application,"I was misled by a user review that indicated the gels would help my new Jawbone stay in my ear without the hook. The gels would stay in my ear but came off my headset, allowing it to fall to the ground. These may be OK but not for my application."
2,Jabra Eargels,The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice.
1,didn't fit my ears,"Complete waste of money. All three sizes pushed my Jawbone ICON out too far from my face to make contact with my jawbone.I know my ears stick out ... I am not dumbo though. This was a waste of money for me, thankfully they were only 10 bucks.I went back to the ear pads that came with the ICON... Is stays in for a while as long as i don't move... Not quite battlefield worthy as JB claims..."
2,To Big,These were way to big for my ears. Even the small size was to large. I usually wear the medium size ear gel that comes with the BT device. I am using these on a Jabra Extreme 2 so maybe they were not made for that device. The gel did fit properly over the device however but I had to force it hard into my hear and it became pretty painful after a couple of hours of wear.
4,excellent vendor,eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. they fit well and got ere quicker than expected.
3,Sizes Make a Difference,"You will get three different sizes, which is a waste when only one size fits you. Otherwise it is a durable product. I've had others that disintegrate after a few weeks use, but this product lasts."
2,Great for a few weeks,I purchased the eargels which was very comfortable and initally stable. Unforunately after a few weeks of infrequent use my ICON would fall out of the eargel and when stored away it invarable fell out and I would have to replace the ICON back into the eargel. So I have returned to using the original ICON rubber piece which although not as comfortable at least stayed in place.
2,Not compatible with Jawbone Icon,With the rubber ring in place the head set does not seat well in the gels and comes out too easily. With the ring off it will barely stay in the small size. The medium gels fit me best until they are stretched by the rubber ring. One gel even split wen trying to put the earpiece back in. I am trying the small for now until I find a better solution.
1,Terrible design,I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.
2,JABRA GEL FOR EARPHONES,"I was looking forward to some really comfortable gel inserts for my earphones. I thought these would fit the bill, but they don't by a long shot. To begin with, even the smallest size was far too big to fit my ears. The large looked gigantic. I cannot in good faith recommend these. If they develop ones that are sized appropriately, I might give them a try. I gave these to a couple of friends, and even they said there was no way these word work for them either. What more can I say? Stick with inserts from companies like Shure or Westone."
4,"Fast delivery, great product","Super fast delivery. The last ear loop on my Jawbone had worn out. The large ear gel fit over the Jawbone earbud and, with a little superglue, stays there. It fits in my ear without using any loops. After a full day, the ear is a little tender, but it is getting better the more I use it. I would highly recommend the ear gels for anyone with a Jawbone. Improves sound and the fit of the sensor with the jaw."
2,Not for me...,"These probably work great for some people, but they didn't for me. None of the three sizes gave me just the right fit and I ended up going back to the factory gel that came with the device."
1,Worthless,None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...
1,They do not honer their return policy and the product was not what I ordered.,"DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sent me Jabra EarGels claiming they fit the Jawbone Prime 2. They did not. Because I had them for 28 days, they would not take them back. Their return policy stated that you can return up to 30 days.DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as expected,The eargels are uncomfortable to wear. Not exactly sure exactly how they should fit in my ear.
4,"So much better than ""over the ear""","I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'."
4,More than just Jabra,"I used these pieces on my Samsung WEP200. removed the supplied piece and slipped these on. Fit perfectly on the device. Holds well in my ear. Creates a little bit of pressure/discomfort on the ""wing"" at the top during extended wear. Still a very good product IMO."
1,Waste of money,This product ended up being a waste of money for me. They didn't fit too well so I ended up just using the original Jawbone ear piece with the these.
4,jabra eargels,These really do make wearing a jawbone a lot better for me. The only problem I found with them is that you have to buy so many just to get the one that fits right.
2,Jawbone Repair Kit? Maybe,"In an odd case of poor quality control, the package of eargels came with two of one of the six sizes and missing one of the others. I bought them to make my Jawbone headset fit. It's better than it was, but still not ergonomic."
1,don't buy,these were advertised to fit the habra stone. they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit. threw them away
2,Waste of money,"These ear gels were supposed to fit easily on the Jabra Bluetooth that I have, but they don't stay on at all once they were placed on it. I was hoping the contoured shape would hold in my ears, but it just proved to be very uncomfortable."
3,They fit great but were discolored upon delivery,The ear pieces fit great and the sound is fantastic but they were yellow when I got them in the package. I expected them to be clear colored like the advertised picture but I needed them for driving right away. Oh well.
1,Not well suited for the Jawbone II,"When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II, they were fantastic. They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset. The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone, and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear. I tried washing and drying them thoroughly, but that only helped for an hour or so. I am not sure what the fit problem is, but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all."
2,Does not fit jawbone 2 very well,I bought this based on the reviews that said that these will fit the jawbone 2 bluetooth headset. They did not fit very well and were very loose. I use the small size and they did not fit very well. The medium and large size do not fit my ear canal. Too bad as I need an in-ear bluetooth to hear well. I guess I will have to look for something else.
4,Perfect for Jawbone 2,"Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssassin-Jawbone II (Black)[Retail Packaged]Jawbone Bluetooth Headset with NoiseAssasin-Jawbone II (Silver)[Retail Packaged]These ear buds fir snugly over the stem of the Jawbone II and fit snugly, comfortably in my ear. They were necessary for me to use the Jawbone as it requires both good ear fit and good jaw contact to work at all. Many, like me, cannot achieve both fits with the ear loops and buds that come with the Jawbone.In a perfect world there would be a Jabra gel half way in size between medium and large, but either works well for my ear. I suspect most ears would find a comfortable functional fit with at least one of the three sizes they sell (3 sizes, left and right per package). They only cost a few dollars."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I'm giving these a 3 star rating because despite the three different sizes, I never felt as if they gave a good fit. They are soft, but still contributed to some fatigue after wearing for more than an hour. Additionally, I bought these ear gels to replace the factory ear bud on the Jawbone 2. I never got a good fit and seal, and the JB2 felt unstable while wearing the ear gels. Also, they distorted the angle for the JB2, which needs to have a contact point along to jawbone to work properly. I eventually went back to the factory ear bud, which is less comfortable, but more functional."
4,Works well with the Samsung WEP200,I wanted an in ear blue tooth headset but couldn't get them to stay in. these made it work!
4,The perfect thing to make the Jawbone Bluetooth headset fit - without the ear loop,"I was in hell with my Jawbone until I got these. I think I need to glue the thing on with a little Superglue, which I haven't. I keep it in a little pouch in my purse with my phone so it doesn't matter if it falls off...but gluing it on would fix it. But it makes my Jawbone fit perfectly and stay in my ear, and no earloop -- I've removed the dumb earloop altogether. You have to experiment with the sizes and play around with the fit at first, then it becomes second nature.Oh, and you have to remove the Jawbone earthingy -- the rubbery piece -- which is accomplished easily enough by turning it and pulling it off. It's on a little track, and turns like a jar lid."
5,Bought for Jawbone Bluetooth Headset,"I bought these to use in place of the earpieces that were included with the Jawbone. With these I am able to remove the bow that goes over the ear and just wear it in my ear. The Jawbone does not fall out of my ear, and I walk all over work without risk of losing it."
2,Jabra Ear Gels,I ordered the ear gels to go with my Jawbone Bluetooth headset. The problem that I see is that the ear gels are too bulky when combined with the Jawbone.
1,Stick it in your ear!,"I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]"
3,Does not fit Jawbone Era well,"Jabra earbuds are reasonably comfortable, but they fit loosely over the Jawbone ERA. Put the earbud in the ear, then push the ERA into the earbud. That said, they are sufficiently secure that I have not yet lost it from the ear."
1,"Thanks for nothing, Jabra","Jabra directed me to these as a replacement for the lost pieces for my Wave. THESE ARE NOT what I need. Meh. Gonna be two more weeks before I get home to return them.I don't blame the merchant, blame Jabra for directing me to waste weeks buying, waiting for, and returning the wrong stuff. Swedish morons"
1,useless,"For some reason the makers of this item thought it would be wise to make each size ear piece fit a different bluetooth. The small fits my Jawbone, but does not fit my ear. The large fits my ear just fine, but does not fit my Jawbone. Save your money and find a different product."
2,scottiesgems,I bought this to see if using the gels would help keep my Jawbone in place. None of the gels fit in my ear.
5,Good,I have not really had a chance to use these but my daughter states that it works for her very well.
4,good,a little uncomfortable but the only way my bluetooth headset would stay in my funny little ears.
1,Old and yellowed,"Ordered the EarGels, but they had been exposed to time and heat. They were yellowed and sticky. I threw them away - wasn't worth it to return it. Won't order from here again."
3,"Good product, but not for Jawbone","The ear gels are a comfortable fit, but they tend to keep the original jawbone bluetooth headset further away from the face. The headset does not sit against the side of your face."
4,Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.,"All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need."
3,ear plugs,"The ear plugs are comfotable, but are easily dislodged from the head set. The combination of the earplugs and headset are troublesome to put on. Many times the earplug becomes unattached in the process so one starts over."
3,"Decent alternative to the Jawbone ""new fit"" earbuds","I love my Jawbone II but using the earloop was an issue with my glasses. I first tried out these Jabra EarGels and they worked decently. I especially felt like everything would fall out when I opened my mouth wide (yawning for example). Overall they were adequate and got the job done but now that Aliph is selling their own ""new fit"" ear gels I find I haven't been using the Jabras anymore. Aliph's fit my ear better."
4,eargels saves my bluetooth,I have a jabra bluetooth that I just could not get to sit on my ear correctly. It sat in the drawer never being used with the addition of the ear gels not only can I use it but now it is comfortable.
3,Ok - if you happen to have ears the size of these inserts,"These seemed like they would be really comfortable and with three size options you'd think one would fit. Wrong. None of them worked and so we couldn't use them. However, they are soft to the touch and seem like they would be great if you are lucky enough to fit."
3,un-necessary purchase with jawbone2,"I purchased these ear gels to go with the Jawbone 2 and found them to be unnecessary. i had read several reviews about them going well with the Jawbone. They were too big for my ears, and thus made the Jawbone too far away from my face."
5,It's a keeper!,"I first looked through this cookbook in another lady's kitchen. She had it all earmarked and I could tell she had tried many of the recipes. I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic."
3,"Good, not great","The movie is certainly good enough to purchase, but I don't agree with most of the reviewers here that it was ""fabulous."" As some pointed out, the script could use some help. I liked the cast. Armand Asanti is wonderful in the lead role, Isabella and Bernadette are always fun to watch, as is the stunningly gorgeous Vanessa Williams. And, of course, Eric ""They took my thumbs!"" Roberts (poor Eric is so underated).For a movie made in 1997, they sure skipped on the special effects. The effects were cool enough, but no razzle-dazzle here. Even so, it's a good flick for a rainy Saturday and for $10, ya really can't go wrong."
1,Great effects...NO HEART NO PASSION,"The special effects of this film were wonderful--no debate there--but Armand Assante seems like he's sleep-walking through this movie. It LOOSELY follows the poem at parts and suffers from a severe lack of passion! Compare this film with the 1950's ""Ulysses"", which despite poor effects, had MUCH more passionate and inspired portrayals of the characters by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn among others. Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in ""The Odyssesy"". Still...not enough to do the story justice."
2,Poor excuse for a great story,"I watched this movie this year after I read the book. The movie switches the story a lot and the acting is very dissapointing- the actors of Odysseus, Penelope and Telemachus, the main parts are not very talented. I would show this to a child to give them a taste of the Odyssey, but if you have read the book or are planning to, watching this will ruin the flavor of the Odyssey."
3,As an instructional resource . . .,"I viewed this video and while I thought most of it was true to the original poem, I was disturbed that the creators chose to place the death of Heracles (known commonly to us with the Roman name of Hercules) at the Trojan War, when it did not occur at that actual place. The acting was decent; the best use of it is to depict the monsters of Greek mythology in an exciting format."
2,This movie is not all that,"originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star, but because of one of the last scenes where ugly t(telemachus) threw two spears at once, i give it two stars. Everything was horrible to my opinion. The accents kept changing everything. If you read the book before you watched the movie, you would thinkt hat this was all a joke. So if anything just read the book by itself. So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T"
1,absolutely HORRIBLE,"I have never been so disgusted (or sickenly entertained) by a movie before. I am one of the few who have ACTUALLY read the ODYSSEY. I did like the poem. After reading it, I decided to watch the movie. There were almost NO accurate allusions at all to the poem. The characters' acting skills were that of an elementary school kids, and the scenes were obviously fake. I feel bad for Homer, he must be spinning in his grave. The fact that got 4 out of 5 stars is most appalling. I feel sorry for humanity as it is, believing such [nonsense] is the work of Homer."
5,A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This Oddysey is great for anyone that has a sense of adventure or just likes the Greek myths. It is well done and has a great cast of characters. The movie is a summary of all the adventures Oddyseus had to go through in order to get back to Ithaca- to his wife and son. I highly recommend this movie and give it five full stars.
4,For The Hellenites Out There,"The Oddyssey, as most of you know, was originally an epic poem written by the ancient Greek, Homer. If you are interested in ancient Greek culture, this is a good movie to check out. I've read the poem and much of the context is the same in the movie as in the poem. The order and storyline differs but it is still a close match. I've you're planning on reading The Oddyssey, check this movie out. It will help you understand the poem better."
5,Actioned packed,The movie wsa filled with action and lots of special effects....I loved the plot and the sory was meaning full.
1,WOW,"Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something."
5,The Odyssey,"I think the movie 'The Odyssey' was great. You would think for this movie that the special effects would be really bad, but they wern't. 'The Odyssey' is about a man called Odissius. He and his wife Penelope had a son. But on the day Oddisiusses son was born he had to go to the Trojan war. The story has many twists and turns as he goes through the jorney of trying to get back home."
1,Uhh..... Were they stoned?,"This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!"
1,Uggh,"Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew"
2,Mullets across the Med,"I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney."
1,More like a NEGATIVE 3,"This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!"
1,I agree,"I totally agree with andrew...and by the way, people who dont know any of us and dont really know whats going on...please dont waste your time with this movie...you're better off watching old reruns of whos the boss...even though im deprived of cable and wouldnt know...most of you probably know who this is"
3,Not user friendly,"Those of you that who do not have English as your first langhuage,are hard of hearing,or are Deaf should note that the production company did not bother to caption the film. Inexcusible in this day and age, particularly since this subject is often covered in school."
2,coulda been betta!!!!!!!!,the special effects sucked and we've seen good special effects and the special effects in the odessy were crap and in comparison to a lot of movies we've seen it was pretty crap. it was realy BORING! (...) we've seen and weve seen heaps of them and some of them were realy gory over all COULDA BEEN BETTA!!!!!
1,Blech,"This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great ""in"" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school."
4,Good visual,"I teach Engish to freshmen and we read The Odyssey as part of our curriculum. This movie version is well done and I enjoy showing it to the students. (They enjoy it, which adds to my own.) It stays pretty true to the version we read and the monsters, gods, etc., are portrayed well. The only hesitancy I have with it at all regards Circe and Calypso. There are some brief sexual innuendos/situations with these two women, which there are more of in the story, but generally not in the story provided in freshmen anthologies. However, at the freshmen level, it's completely within boundaries to show it. Watching the movie adds a dimension to the written word, and provides opportunities for comparing and contrasting as well. I will continue to show it."
3,Great subject & spec effects; could've been truer to Homer.,"Being a fan of Homer, the Trojan War, et al, I had to watch the flick; however, I was somewhat disappointed with the overall treatment of the story; although the props, for the most part, seemed historically correct, the writers had to make changes that deviated from the Homeric epic. For instance, the battle scene with Ahkilleus and the death of Hektor was far-removed from the actual lines (kind of like how they reinvented ""Helen of Troy."" From recollection (since I've yet to find the video or see a rerun in over 20 yrs) ""Ulysses"" with Kirk Douglas, is by far, the best rendition of the Odyssey."
1,THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!,"As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful"
1,"Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too.","NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****"
1,"Ouch! This movie was so bad, it was funny","Everything about this movie was baaadddd....From the everchanging accents, the fake special effects(the cyclops looked so fake that it took away from the movie), the movie was so flawed that it became more entertaining to look for the flawed parts than actually watch the movie. Yeah, this movie sucked."
4,The Odyssey with Armand Asanti,I really like this version; especially since there is really very few versions of this work of literature.
4,Fun to Watch,"This movie was just so much fun to watch. It was originally made for TV, so when you watch it without commercials you're able to get the full effect of the story without interruptions. This is based on the story The Odyssey by Homer and it follows the story fairly well. Some of the adventures are left out, and some are unfortunate to be so, but the main part of the story of there so you don't feel they just did what they wanted with it.The acting is very good for a TV movies, as are the special effects. They're not cheap looking which is something TV movies have a problem with sometimes. The costumes are good and the sets are too. You feel like you're with him traveling around the Mediterranean trying to find home.The ending felt a little rushed to me though. I felt they could have spent a bit more time on that."
4,An enjoyable movie,"First, this is an adaptation on The Odyssey. As the director said in the featurette, he omitted a lot of the direct philosophical discussion that is in the poem itself and focused more on the action and story line.Personally, I'm glad he did. This is a very enjoyable movie and throughout the movie you're just waiting to see Odysseus return home. And with every setback he faces, you keep thinking he'll get it the next time. Only to see it happen again!The acting is pretty good overall. There are some notable lapses of skill by a few cameo people like Bernadette Peters, though. But thankfully it is a very small segment. This DVD isn't really for young children. Too much violence. Especially at the end.Not many extras on the DVD, but the story's the real thing, eh?"
2,Agonizingly Long,"Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this movie was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. I will never watch it again, so this one is headed for the public library and a status of tax deduction. Good special effects, though hence my 2-star rating."
5,"Armande Asante, need I say more?",This movie is fabulous. Anyone who is a fan of greek mythology or the Roman era would love this movie.I cannot get enough of Armande Asante and this movie portrays him in a way that would make any woman drool.Definitely a great buy. {^_^}
5,The Odyssey.,My review was about The Odyssey.I think that this movie is a good movie to watch and you might learnt something from this story. The Odyssey is about when he had a wife with his baby and he left on a journey after defeating Troy! He met many monsters and many perils over many years! I loved the action and special effects in this movie! It was cool!
5,Entertainment is not always accurate!,"I have read and re read all of the reviews for this film and I have to say my two cents. I have been studying Ancient Mythology(mostly Egyptain) for the past ten years. Yes, this film is NOT 100% correct. What film is? History is always open to interpertation. Anyone who does not understand this needs a new hobby. Anyhoo I loved it, Armand Assante was amazing in his role. The rest of the cast was great too. There was a veil of erotitisem throughout the film, which was interesting considering the film wasn't outwardly graphic. Overall, the movie was wonderful. Don't rent this film, buy it! (you'll want to watch it over and over!)"
4,The Odyssey is Impressive,"Considering that this is a TV Mini-Series I am impressed with the overall quality of this movie. The actors are terrific, especially Armand Assante as Odysseus and Greta Scacchi as his wife Penelope. The direction is swift and competent and the special effects are just that, special. I have been teaching The Odyssey for more than 10 years now and I'm glad that someone finally made a film of the story that can show the more visual aspects and intimate scene within this great tale. The old film with Kirk Douglass was awful. I enjoyed this film and so do my students when I have time to show (it is very long)."
1,Hallmark Entertainment needs to join us in the 21st Century,"It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing. If they have realized this, then they obviously could care less about disabled people of any kind."
1,"Awful, just awful",Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option.
1,Who be dissin on our noteboom?,"Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY. God knows if you did you wouldnt be madly in love with this made-for-TV movie THE ODYSSEY. Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself."
3,Movie Review for Odyssey,"The movie THE ODYSSEY was interesting and informative, though the set decoration and special effects were a bit low-budget. Greta Scacchi and Armand Assanti are very well cast and they are both fine actors. My favorite part of THE ODYSSEY was the scene in which Odysseus shows his son, Telemachus, their island and their home shortly after he was born. There were also several other interesting parts to this movie. In addition, there were several good special effects to make this movie more interesting, and add to it a taste of science fiction, and Greek mythology. All in all, I would reccommend this movie to anyone who, first of all, has alot of time to kill, and second of all, is curious about the ways of Ancient Greece, or to someone who just wants to watch a high-action movie with a happy ending."
4,WOW,"This was a great movie. The beginning was a little rocky, but then it smoothed out a little bit. The movie had great special effects and a great cast. Some of my favorite characters were Odysseus (Armand Assante), Telemachus (Alan Stenson), and Calypso (Vanessa Williams). This movie was very gory, but in a way I think that made it better. In this epic poem by Homer, my favorite part was when Odysseus shot an arrow through the axe handles. Overall, my opinion of this movie is that its a masterpiece."
3,The Odyssey,"The Odyssey was a very inspiring film. The special effects were awesome, expecially the cyclops. All of the actors/actresses did a wonderful job. My personal favorite was Greta Scacchi (Penelope). Armand Assante (Odysseus) sort of drifted through the movie, although he wasn't aful. My favorite god/godess was Michael J. Pollard (Aeolus). He played a very comical role. My favorite scene was when Odysseus was on the islan of the suductive Calyso (Vanessa L. Williams). It was well played how all of her maids had never seen a man before. Overall I would reccomend this movie to anyone who wants it for educational proposes or just to watch a good film."
4,The Odyssey,"This is a beautiful three hour film version of Homer's 'Odyssey'. The film captures the essence of Odysseus's adventures and misadventures following the end of the Trojan War. I enjoyed watching it with my four and a half year old grandson who loved every moment of it. We have watched the film several times, discussed it and have now begun to read the book."
4,Austerity of the cell,"These earliest of monks take Christ's admonition ""to sell everything and follow Him"" to heart. With deep austerity, and prayer they follow a path utterly dedicated to a spiritual life. Despite their austerity, there are at times a surprising expressions of personality, and even community among the solitaire cells and companionship of the monks. There are stories of hermits with lions as companions, of sustainment of a few herbs or palm leaves, of them helping thieves stealing from them, or selling Gospels to help the poor. However these monks are humble in their faith, and a lesson often repeated in these stories is humility and compassion for temptations that they themselves feel. The temptations of women, and even a monks' expression of Pelagia ""the harlots"" beauty was surprisingly sensuous. It may seem impossible for us to be isolated like this, but we can quest for solitude as abbot Antony said ""Who sits in solitude escapes from three wars: hearing, speaking, seeing"""
3,So-so,"I agree with the review of C. Ryan: ""One really needs to dig for the most compelling and enlightening material.""It's an okay read, but probably has more to offer the historian looking for tidbits of insight into the day-to-day lives of the desert fathers, than it does the spiritual seeker hoping to find a spiritual snack."
3,Basic Introduction,"This book is an OK introduction, but otherwise disappointing. There are many other books out there much better. Helen Waddell did translate these writings from the Latin. The problem is that save for the first selection from St. Jerome (originally written in Latin) all of the selections are translations from the Latin but the Latin translations from which Waddell translates are translations of other authors from the original Greek.Still, if you have not been exposed at all to the thoughts and beliefs of our early Christian monks it may be a good brief introduction. You will get a look into how these early monastic thought and lived their lives. Of course in any translation of the Desert Fathers you will find words of wisdom that you will benefit from."
3,More adventures in Corfu,"Gerald Durrell has written quite a few books, including 3 about his life as a young boy on the Greek Island of Corfu. This is the middle book of the trilogy and is not as funny as the other two (My Family and Other Animals and In the Garden of the Gods). He relates various stories about his childhood which involved ranging far and wide on the island observing and collecting various animals, birds and insects. The stories are pleasant and interesting, just not laugh out loud funny like his other books. I did enjoy it.I wouldn't recommend for middle school because one story contains pretty graphic detail of a peasant woman giving birth."
4,Another fix of Durrell family fun,"I eagerly read this after ""My Family and Other Animals"" (which I had enjoyed immensely). It contains stories which were omitted from ""My Family"" and while the offerings were still magical and wonderfully well-written and sometimes hilarious (especially the story about the turtle), it lacked the memorability of its predecessor. There was also no real structure in the order of the stories, this is more of a miscellaneous collection."
5,My family and other animals,"I read Gerald Durrell's books 10 years ago, while I was still living in Romania. I loved his books from the first page to the last and literally I couldn't put them down until I finished them. The best humour I ever met in books! His stile is unique. I am planning on reading all of them again in English. I would recommend them to anyone!"
5,Another book of lovely excursions to the island of Corfu,"This is another wonderful books of Gerald Durrell's memories of his time on the island of Corfu prior to the Second World War. He takes us back to another time and place before the world changed for good.Each chapter is a separate story and rememberence of those days when as a young man he marvels at not only the natural world around him, but also the various people he encounters and learns to appreciate. It is easy to get lost in one of these stories and feel like you are there with him on a hot summer day with his faithful dogs tagging along beside him.I recommend this book to anyone who not only loves nature, but also can appreciate a time gone by when people were different and even strangers were looked as guests. This book is one that I intend to read again and again in the coming years and will appreciate the stories just much each time as the first time."
1,Can't get worse,This book is bad (period). It is very incoherent and ill-organized. The examples are vague and serve anything but support the material. Very theoritical with hardly any real life applications. Lacking in modern AI topics/game design.
1,Nauseating,"In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."
2,Bad memory leakes,"The software is nice to work with, not very simple to use but usable none the less. The only problem I've encountered with this software is the notoriously bad encoder with memory leaks up to wazoo. If you try to encode a large movie file into mpeg2 premiere will more than likely crash on you due to bad memory management. The only solution so far is to simply restart the system and pray it wouldn't happen again. Although from my experience it seems to work the 3rd time you try. I have tried this on two brand new machines one with a new XP 32bit install and both expereienced the same issue."
1,RE: Wipeout originally by Surfaris,"Google the instrumental Wipeout , and you will read the real story. I love the Surfari's version which got to #2 on the Billboard charts in a matter of weeks."
2,Mirror came damaged and late,After contacting the seller about the item never being received a second was shipped. When we got it the mirror itself had fallen out of the housing. We didn't want to wait an additional month to get a replacement so we glued the mirror back on the housing.
5,GReat solution for a special space...,"Great solution for a special space. I know how difficult is to hang things from a modern ceiling. This item, will solve that problem. Installation is very fast and price was great. Seller was very fast delivering the item. Good job."
2,below average,"I bought this one because its excellent review of another customer. Picture format is only in 4:3 which is ashame. Though the quality of the picture is good. Good encoding, beautifull skin tones. Pitty the lightning director is not that creative and used that awfull backlights with gobo's. The sound is in AC-3 5.1 dolby, but never impressing, and with low dynamics. It's the regular TV-mix we hear, it's not remixed for dolby 5.1 with it's extra dynamics and LFE output.I feel the band is average. The directors cut is not more than an average TV-special. All the way, wouldn't recommend it."
4,Good DVD,"Enjoyed it immensely. The sound is best in stereo. The DTS and 5.1 mix are both done poorly imo. But, the stereo sound is very good!"
5,Psalms Now a moving and useful worship resource,After using Psalms Now in Bible study for litergical prayer I decided to try it in a Contemporary Christian Worship setting. The response was phenomenal. Whether it is used as a basis for prayer or in a traditional liturgical style it is a very helpful book to bring the psalmists words to life!
2,The Diamond Hunters,"This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either."
2,The Diamond Hunters,Terminally boring and predictable but was able to finish it. I would rate his Monsoon and the early Courtney triliogy as 4-5 stars.
2,Totally Unbelievable Tale,This book falls in the bottom five of the 28 books that I have read by Wilbur Smith. There is no review of the African continent that is so prevalent in his other books. No intermingling of the diverse peoples that populate this country that you find in most of these books. Here there is nothing here but greed and sex without purpose and typical family squabbles.To my knowledge diamond mining has never been done in this fashion in Africa.
4,Great to learn lowercase letters,"We had read the original book before, this one is half that story, but it is long enough for a little one to work through each page with the magnets.My favorite thing about this book is that it teaches the lowercase letters (we had mastered the uppercase ones already), and this was a very useful tool because she loves to work with the magnets!It was easy for her to confuse 'b' and 'q', and 'd' and 'p' as they are from the same mould (but different colors)."
2,Poorly Made,What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead
2,I was rooting for the whale in this one,"Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout ""ENGAGE"" rather than ""THERE SHE BLOWS"".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it"
3,A good family movie,I watched this movie with my children after having read them the wishbone version of the story. They were fascinated. The violence is just right for family viewing and my eight year olds found it mesmorizing and intense. I thought it could have been better (the whale wasn't very realistic) but it was fine for a made for TV movie. I found it to be perfect for family viewing.
3,Rent it don't buy it!,"If you really want to see this movie, I recommend you rent it don't buy it. It was hard to stay awake to get through the entire movie. The last 40 minutes are practically the only parts worth watching. Patrick Stewart on the other hand played an excellent part as usual. I bought this movie because I caught the last half hour on television and it looked great. If only I had known. :("
1,A pitiful excuse for a movie,"If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."
3,"Ahab's Loss, Patrick Stewart's Victory","I saw this version of Moby Dick on the ION Television network. I have seen the original 1956 movie and read the book and I must say, this verision holds true to the epic journey and intense obession to both previous incarnations. The visual enhancements allow us a greater view of the bane of Ahab's existance moreso than the '56 movie and therefore allowed us to feel the challenge and terror of facing such a huge beast in it's own element. Moby Dick's willingness to turn and attack rather than just escape by diving deep, gives it an almost human quality for retribution against those who would do it harm. Patrick Stewart's Ahab does not appear as ""insane"" as Gregory Peck's, but he is just as intense and in a way, because of that, is a bit more frightening. Overall, Stewart gave an excellent performance and maintained the story's classic status."
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"The original Moby Dick book is in some cases better than the movie.... that's true.... but the actors (instead of Patrick Stewart (normally i really love him) his role was good, but tooo nervous and toooo crazy... it didn't sypathize with the other roles... e.g. Starbuck, Ismail ...) the whale was stupid and awful, like in a very low budget film... could be much better... but it's worth to buy it and to watch ....! that's my opinion ... bye and enjoy the time you see moby dick"
2,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!,"Dont bother with this crap! It is one of the worst if not the worst! Movies that I have ever seen! It has bad acting,story and it is so so boring! I dont understand the point of this movie! TERRIBLE! DONT BOTHER!"
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!"
3,I had hoped for more,"Patrick Stewart is an incredible actor. I love his character in Star Trek and after the Star Trek movie where he finishes a quote from Moby Dick -- in a quiet, but passionate speech that he alone would stand agains the Borg, I expected more of this movie.But Patrick never reaches that deep, intraspective level. He is almost there when he realizes that he has driven Mr. Starbuck to contemplate murdering him. The tension between Mr. Starbuck and Capt. Ahab should have been more powerful. It was almost there, but not quite. I might have been an editing problem. It could have been a director problem. Not sure how or why this movie fell short, but it did. Mr. Starbuck plays his part well -- emotive and personal. He brings alive the man who ""Can no longer follow his God and follow Capt. Ahab,"" but the tempo and rhytm of the movie just didn't keep the necessary tension."
2,Classics never die!,"If your looking for a different version of the classic ""Moby Dick"" then fine. Personally I thought it fell short of the mark. The only highlight for me was when Gregory Peck made his apperance as the preacher. The original is still the one and only."
2,Simply awful,"I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."
3,Boo. Strange version of Moby Dick,"This is one strange version of Moby Dick. Patrick Stewart's Ahab is not a man thirsting for revenge to the point of obsession. Instead, Stewart plays Ahab straight out of the insane asylum. The dialogs between Ahab and Starbucks must have been an attempt to create a play-like, stylized dialog, but instead, it came across as a lot of mad ravings. I've read the book many times, and I viewed Ahab as a man with an obsession, not a man who is a street lunatic who just happens to command a whaling ship (when he is not being abducted by aliens.)Sorry to have to slam Stewart, who I love as an actor. He did indicate in press interviews that he was very insecure about playing Captain Ahab. I guess it shows. I can however, wholeheartedly compliment the Maori actor Piripi Waretini who plays Queequeg (my favorite character in the book) and Ted Levine was very fine as Starbuck. This film, though interesting and a bold attempt, just doesn't capture the real sense of Moby Dick."
2,Weak remake,I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. Stewart's potrayal of Ahab didn't have any of the power of Gregory Peck's 1956 character.The camera work was also terrible. Land is clearly seen in several scenes where the men are supposedly many months out to sea.
4,I liked it!,"The other fellow said Patrick Stewart hammed it up too much, but I actually liked him in this part. I read to book too, and it is mostly ""everything you ever wanted to know about mid 19th century's understanding of whales... and more."" Limited action in the book. But I thought they did a pretty good job of creating the movie around the action in the book, and followed the story well. I have not seen Gregory Peck's version of Ahab, but I thought Patrick Stewart made a good madman."
5,Exceptional Movie,"Just like any movie produced from a book, if you compare it to the book, it will most certainly fall short. If you take the movie in the context that its a dramatic movie made to enthrall you for a couple of hours, than you'll find this movie exceptional. I watch it about twice a year and find it one of the better movies in my personal collection."
1,DRASTIC EDITS RUIN THE VHS VERSION,"It seems that there are several different versions of this TV movie available. Rumor has it that the movie that was originally broadcast on USA came in at 3 hours, there is a laser disc version of the movie that is 145 minutes long, and the VHS version is 120 minutes long. Unfortunately, the edits made to the VHS version are so extreme, abrupt, and awkward that it makes the movie virtually unwatchable. You can't help but feel that you're missing something."
4,Solid production with a few quibbles,"Patrick Stewart handles Ahab admirably, and Gregory Peck as the minister giving his blessings and warnings at the outset provides continuity to the version in which he himself played Ahab.Two points to consider:1. Queequeg is played with considerable energy and earthy humor, but the actor risks veers close to a ""John Belushi"" homage (which has its own charms).2. I found the English subtitles (for those of us who need help hearing) contain an unacceptable number of errors - from simple misspellings (e.g., ""thoudsands"" for ""thousands"") to text that appears to be the transcribed notes of a non-native English speaker (as heard by his/her ear and written out by sound). I highly recommend that Amazon contract with an editor to review the English subtitles, edit appropriately, and that Amazon find a way to insert corrected text. The errors are so distracting that I would even ask Amazon to send corrected versions to those who request a swap-out (such as myself)."
3,Great Heater until it started leaking,"I love this heater, it warms up my bedroom and I like that it has settings and a thermostat. BUT after 3 or 4 uses it began to leak a clear oil. Fortunately I have wood floors and it didn't stain, I would have been furious if I had a carpet ruined. I called the manufacturer and they told me I had to ship it to them to be fixed at my own expense. Fortunately Amazon was much more accomodating. I am hoping I got a lemon and the replacement will not have this problem. Bottom line, great heater but watch carefully for leaks."
4,Favorably impressed!,"This little heater works far better than I'd hoped. I tested it in my toughest space, the 10 x 40 glassed front porch. For three nights, the outside temp was right at 27. The radiator on its highest setting kept the porch temp at 60! In other, smaller, rooms getting a cozy heat is no big deal. The only noise it makes is an occasional (low) click. I'd have given it five stars if the dial were easier to read, and it had a handle on both sides instead of one."
2,Long term owner,"Had this for 3 years. It isn't much to look at, doesn't heat as strong as Delonghi TRD0715T i own. But worst of all it started to leek on the second year. ..Not recommended.."
3,Shipping Delonghi EW0507 Oil-Filled Radiator Heater,"Goog product, but its packaging can not survive the shipping. Both Heaters came damaged and I have to return them back and cancell further replacements."
3,"Quiet, but has long time to heat","Its ok.Quiet.NOt so impressed with its fast heating,takes a bit of time.I knocked it over accidentally and the heater cut the electric cord right in half! (?)"
1,Ordered this item 3 weeks ago still waiting....,"The description said usually ships in 1-2 business days, well it's been 1 month and I have another month to go until I recieve this item. Don't believe the descriptions! I ordered this 3 weeks ago now the delivery estimate is the end of November. If you are cold and need this item this year don't buy it from Amazon. It probably won't arrive until February! It's going to take 2 months for delivery! Just a warning!"
4,Implausible But Satisfying Read,"Typical of Ms. Smith's work, the story of Hush and her apple empire can't help but wash over the reader's heart even while their brain disconnects over some of the story's plausibility. Well, it really doesn't matter if all you want is a fun, romantic read. Afterall, a writer is supposed to have a good imagination, right? Ms. Smith is especially good when developing her characters, flaws and all. This writer never disappoints the true romance reader."
2,Pretty Corny,"I've read several other Deborah Smith books. In my opinion Blue Willow was the best. Sweet Hush was by far the corniest book, I've read in a long time. The phrase ""Sweet Hush"" must have been at used at least 100 times in the book. The main character ""Hush"" was predictable and one dimentional. If you enjoy Deborah Smith books, I would skip this one."
3,Very enjoyable,"Sweet Hush was an enjoyable read. Although a lot of it was far fetched, it was well written; I swear I could smell the apples!"
5,Sweet Read,"It's been a long time since a book kept me up on a week night, but Sweet Hush was that kind of read. I loved the characters, I loved the family, and wondering where they were all going to end up made this a un-put-downable book for me. Wish they'd make a movie of the story! I was already casting it in my head."
5,Quriky but Fun!,"I acutally bought this for my kindle and fell so in love with this quirkly little story that I turned around and bought the hardback book for my mom. Deborah Smith has given us this wonderful cast of characters that believe in family and the family business. They love each other, stand up for each other, and will do anything to protect each other. I know the plot has been review by other readers, so let me just say this: it doesn't matter what your genre of reading is, this story will draw you in and keep you entertained. It is a wonder story and a terrific read."
5,Very good introduction to the field,The authors takes time to explain the basic hypotheses of statistical mechanics. I believe that it is an excellent introduction to this field.
2,A nice companion to McQuarrie's text,"I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book. McQuarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter. One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book."
4,"Old, but a good place to begin for a novice.","Twenty five years since I've seen a classroom. I had a burning desire to pick up where I left off. What I needed was a good introduction but I could not find my ""Elements of Statistical Thermodynamics"" by K. Nash (an excellent little book). So I tried Chandler's book, modern but not a beginners text. For the true beginner, I'd suggest ""Intro. To Thermophysics by Espinola, WCB (c) 1994"". After Espinola, go to Hill's book a great bridge at a bargin before going to Chandler. Hill's style is clear but examples are given a condensed treatment. Not a problem solving book, but a good book if physical understanding and a bridge forward is your goal."
5,No better place to start with Stat Mech,"If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists"
4,recommended,"This is an ancient stat. mech. book with a lot of old topics. Most of the chapters after 8 (there are 22 I think) are directed towards chemical applications. I think this book and McQuarrie are about even, Chandler is better if you know a little about stat mech already, much much worse if you know nothing. This book is also really cheap so I don't think you can go wrong in getting it. The explanations are pretty good in both this and McQuarrie, though I don't always like the organization of Hill."
4,Clearly written,This was the textbook in the statistical mechanics course I took a few years ago. The single greatest feature of this book compared to so many other texts in statistical mechanics and related fields is its clear presentation of some sort of intuition behind the concepts. That alone makes it worth buying. And it's so cheap that you may as well just buy it.
5,An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics- Terrel L.Hill,"An excellent text book for Physical Chemist who want to get sound footing in Statistical Thermodynamics.Inorder to really get a good view of the basics of statistical mechanics the reader really needs to spend an adequate amount of time in digesting the contents of the initial chapter. However, after spending some amount of time in reading those initial chapters, one can grasp the latter parts of the book in a quite interesting fashion.In my opinion, this book is a must for those who want to master the statstical thermodynamics. Infact, one would be really amazed at the standard of the book considering the fact that it is reasonably old. No new standard books on ' Statistical Mechanics' can provide such an adequate foundations as it in this book. I would strongly recommend this book along with the other book 'Statistical Mechanics' by the same author.Sasisanker Padmanabhan"
4,Great Series opener,"I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all."
4,Brilliant but Flawed- well worth a read....,"I will keep this short and to the point... the plot and characterization are brilliant but the writing inserts repetitive analytic asides on almost every page... a good writer does indeed use this technique to enrich the story and Perry does succeed quite nicely at times... the problem is totally that she repeats the ideas with little added information many times. If Perry were to rewrite this novel and remove about 30 or so pages of this baggage, she would have one of the best detective novels ever written. Still I highly recommend this book."
4,Great start to a series(Monk).,"Introduction to a series which obviously became rather popular. This offering peaked my curiosity enough to read the second in the series. However, that is where I had to stop."
1,Dreadful.,"Ms. Perry's depiction of post-traumatic head injury is completely irresponsible. She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful."
3,"Love the series, HATE the typesetting and paper","The entire William Monk series by Anne Perry is a must read for anybody interested in historical mysteries. It is absorbing and well written. I was excited to see that recently (i.e., over the past few years) Ballentine Books is re-publishing the entire series in paperback. While the covers are absolutely beautiful, unfortunately, the paper that they use for the book is of mediocre quality. Further, given that the print is painfully small, with a poor choice of font and close typesetting, it becomes difficult to read this particular reprint of the book. The new paperbacks are definitely not worth the ~$15 price tag. I was a little surprised by this since the Random House Publishing Group has a reputation for quality work and Ballantine Books is one of their divisions."
2,A disappointment,"Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed."
5,Perry is now two times as classy!,"William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"
1,"This was the slowest and most non-action, action movie ever.","To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end. I love Van-Damme movies and especially actioners of all types but I found myself desperately trying to stay awake through this. Watch this movie if you have alot of time to hopelessly squander."
2,Boring. Watch at your own risk.,Lets cut to the chase. If u want a better van damm movie. Watch no retreat no surrender. As for this one.save it for a day u got nothing better to do.its a time killer. If your just sitting around.lets get to the point.watch this one only if u need a time killer. If u want a movie with the sickest fights watch guyver2 .yall love it.and this one shelve it.
1,"Van Damme gives the best performance,","which does not bode well for the movie. The other actors are just so horrible and the story so flat. Don't get me wrong, I like Jean-Claude, movies like Timecop and Bloodsport were pretty good for what they were. The fighting scenes in Black Eagle just don't make up for a lame movie though."
1,worst action movie ever,"Totally fake, unrealistic, plotless. I love action movies, but this one just didn't have any action in it. You could see the missed punches and fake reactions--I can't believe that anyone would pay money for this movie"
2,Van Damme's a Bad Guy ?,"I would say the plot is good, but the action and fighting scenes are not in favour for action-movie goers."
2,Where did the producers put all the money in Black Eagle?,"First of all, as a Van Damme fan, this movie is definately one to see (if you must seek joy in seeing van damme die) for die hard van damme fans and that who hate him. For me, the movie feels like a Columbo epidose (the dramatic music) but the film is average, showing few plot, fight scenes or action. The biggest action scene is an explosion of a small wooden boat and a chase scene with cars going as fast as 25 mph! Plus the dvd features are limited and there is NO ""Making of..."" feature, only a theatrical trailer and some production notes (too short). Could have done with more DVD features for a region code free DVD."
1,Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting,Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one
1,I wish I could give 0 stars,"I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt."
4,GREAT ACTION MOVIE!!,"I'm not one to write reviews but it drives me crazy when people put down movies because they're similar to others! I really enjoyed this Van Damme movie. I see it getting put down because of the similarities to Blood Sport, and yes there are similarities BUT it's not the same movie. I gave the movie 4 stars because it was very entertaining and kept my full attention the entire time. There were plenty of action scenes and I loved the plot. DEFINATELY A MOVIE TO SEE!!!"
4,"Little dated, but great","Zaller turns our perception of polling data on its ear. People don't think about most issues until they are asked, so opinion surveying might actually do more to shape opinions than actually report on them."
5,A very informatinve book!,I had to read this book for a class at school and its very well written. This book is very informative and a recommend reading.
1,Didn't work...I have to start again,"My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!"
5,SOLID METAL!!,"Very gald these guys are back, this is the debut album by Hallows Eve and it's brutal, hard edged, pure thrash the way it was ment to be. When I think of the pure 80's thrash metal sound I always think of Hallow's Eve and their first three glorious albums. Solid release, Worth every cent! \m/\m/"
1,A charismatic Lutheran who's more charismatic than Lutheran,"This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidebook for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. However, it offers some dangerous theology. For example, it suggests that it's okay to make mistakes when first trying to prophesy--that everybody needs practice. However, this is contrary to Scripture. God takes false prophecy very seriously, but unfortunately Mr. Christenson does not."
3,Hunters Bow Case,"This case was for my hubby. I'm using what he told me for this review. As far as a hard case, this one works great. There is some sort of bow bag that your bow goes in first then inside this hard case. Another thing he said was that there are straps that hold your bow in place but did not have straps to hold the quiver in place which he felt it really needed. Overall, he's happy with the case. HAPPY HUNTING!!!"
4,Cheaper at a store,bought this case with an amazon gift card i got for my birthday only to find it at a chain sporting goods store for 1/2 the price. over all a great case not ideal for airplain travel but prefect for off season storage.
4,Not quite Gone with the Wind.,"It was interesting to read The Foxes of Harrow again, as a ""senior citizen, since I was only in my early teens the first time I read...and enjoyed...the book. It is quite sensual, considering the year it was written. It has held up fine during the years. I probably understood the nuances better as an adult than as a teenager. Frank Yerby was a brilliant writer, and in this book he presents a balanced view of what white slave owners and their slaves faced during that pre-civil war era. I couldn't help comparing it with Gone With the Wind as I read it."
3,"Very simple masks, no intricate paper cutting or folding","You may get the idea from the cover that the masks inside are intricately made from cutting or folding multiple sheets of paper. However, with the exception of the one mask shown on the cover, they are all made from single sheets. Any 3-D effect is achieved almost exclusively through shading on the prints. Apart from that, simple triangular cuts are made in the corners of each mask so they dome slightly rather than lie flat. I found that disappointing. I'd recommend the book for young children, but it definately has nothing to offer to adults or origami enthusiasts. ..."
2,inside not as good as the cover,"The cover of this book makes the masks look intricate and impressive. On the inside, they look cartoonish. For a Halloween costume, I had more success by blowing up photos of Noh masks on a photocopier and then cutting out the eyes."
2,cognitive dissonance alert ! (or rehash is just hash),"Two stars ONLY because it's not a bad book, as long as you're not a Merovingen Nights fan.If you are, too bad. SOL's basic plot and characters, as well as incidents major and minor, are lifted straight out of the previous series. A few minor adjustments to adapt it to a setting in an ""alternate Italian Renaissance"" instead of the wonderful complex world of MN didn't improve the story at all.It's the same thing, a little more predictable and considerably dumbed down.If you enjoyed the first version, this one will just annoy you with pitiful attempts to change enough details to pretend it's not just hashing over the book you've already read.If you haven't read the original, this book will just spoil it for you.Bad idea-whether it was the author's or the publisher's, it was just a bad idea.Shame on you!"
4,A book that long? Are you kidding me?,"Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list."
2,Weak,"This book was disappointing. It has too many major characters that are inadequately developed and too many plot lines to follow. The magic is an awkward add-in that the book could well have been written without.The first half of the book's plot, several of the characters, and the setting closely resemble one of C. J. Cherryh's Merovingian Nights stories, which was much better."
1,Sad,"Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help."
2,It drags,"I tried a couple of times to read this book. Each time I stopped half way through. It dragged in places and was OK in others, but it's definately not up to Mercedes' usual standard. The book finally wound up in the ""donate to the library"" pile."
1,Mercedes wrote this?,"I've been a longtime fan of Mercedes and own most of her Valdemar series. So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up! I plan to sell it back to my local store ASAP- this is nothing better than a paperweight in my bookshelves. The worst part is, my boyfriend picked it up and tried reading it. Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!"
2,This is not a normal Mercedes Lackey book.,"When I read a Mercedes Lackey book I expect to care about what happens to *someone* in the book. There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows, without true substance (or reasons) to their actions. I couldn't find reasons to cheer for anyone. One problem is there were too many people to follow easily. Since there were so many none of them were drawn richly enough to draw me into their world."
5,A Fabulous Alternative History,"I'm not one who normally likes alternative histories, but this is one of the best, most complex Lackey books I've read in ages. The characters, as always, have depth and humor, and the plot is fascinating -- my one question -- will there be a sequel?One word of caution -- those who have read C.J. Cherryh's Merovingen Nights Series may find many aspects of the plot strangely familiar..."
4,Avid Mercedes Lackey fan who still likes the book,"This book isn't much like Mercedes Lackey's normal writings, but isn't that the point of a collaborative work? I'm only giving it four stars because it is a bit hard to get into at first and the character list is extensive. It can sometimes be difficult to remember who is who, even with the glossary. I found myself having to write notes in the glossary just to record my thoughts on their characters and motivations. The plot is constantly twisting and there is enough humor without making the book silly. I've read almost every book by a female fantasy or sci fi writer (and quite a few of the men as well!) and found this one a delightful change."
3,Disorgainzed,I am an avid SF fan and this book was very hard to follow at first. To many different groups of charectors. After you finally figure out who was who the book was exciting in the end and was very good. Will there be another one? If people are patient they will learn to love this book.
3,The Shadow of the Lion,"I read the book and it was not up to par with Mercedes Lackey's previous books, even the ones co-authored. It seemed as though there were no set rules as to how each character was named. One person would go by the first name another by the last and it was confusing. Content wise it was fairly good. But as I said before it was not the best I have read by this author."
2,Ok at best,"I didn't make it half way through the book before I gave up on it. It just seemed to go on and on and on.... I usually like Mercedes Lackey, but every once in a while, she makes a bobble, and this was one of them. I think the book whould have been a lot better as either two books or one greatly pared down book."
1,This book has already been written,"Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!"
3,Not entirely original,"This novel borrows substantial character and plot material from the Merovingen Nights series (C.J. Cherryh, et al.), but with some new characters and situations. The setting has been moved to 16th century Venice, although in an alternate timeline where the Library at Alexandria was saved, and where magic exists along with demons. People are caught up in political struggles between rival empires, city states, and rival families, with vendettas and assassinations being common. All of that is complicated by demons from the underworld trying to take control and feed on people's souls.The setting is not entirely clear at the beginning, and it is necessary to read a few chapters to get a clear picture of the situation. After that, the story becomes more interesting. It was easy to set aside while reading the early chapters, but I stayed up late to finish the book when I reached the final chapers. Overall, an interesting story."
2,"an OK read, but not what I expected","I am a devoted fan of Mercedes Lackey, and I have read nearly all her books, and this book is by far, my LEAST favorite. i was tempted to quit half-way through, but i didnt, which helped, because alot of things that seemed completely irrelevant, made sense at the very end. the main problem with the story is that there are WAY too many characters, as in a hundred, its hard to keep track & even care about all of them. It has alot of plot & story, and it can be difficult to keep track of at times. Its not a BAD read, its just... very busy, with many many many characters. It was an OK read, but not what I expected."
4,Unheard talent,"Being a huge fan of Green Carnation and Agalloch, I decided to pick up this album and their ""Heart Of The Ages"" album at the same time. Honestly, this album seems like exactly what you would get when you cross those two bands. Impressed? Yes, overall this album was pretty awesome. The dark atmosphere was perfectly created. The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop. Overall though, this album was a great purchase and is a must have for any fans of Agalloch, Green Carnation, or Katatonia."
2,A couple of positives. . .,". . .but not nearly enough to counter the negatives.First the positives:1) Some brilliant photography. One just can't get around this.2) Some truly likeable characters and character development -- especially several of the minor characters.There! That is two stars worth!Negatives:1) Spotty directing, which offsets the quality of the photography2) No earthly resemblance at all to the (true) book from which the story is supposed to have been taken3) A boring, and over-the-top gay agenda (along with any one of a number of similar ""far-left"" issues, poorly cobbled together4) A view of the Virgin Mary, which, while not openly portrayed offensively in the film, is bound, nonetheless to offendIn short, the bad outweighs the good. Skip this one."
2,Under the tuscan sun,to be honest I expected a little more from the movie. it was too mellow and somewhat boring.
1,CHEESY! And I don't mean Parmigiano-Reggiano!,"As a previous reviewer said, it pulled out every single American cliche about Italy in the book, which is pretty much what I had expected. But oh my GAWD was this awful! I was laughing hysterically at this. As bad as a low budget miniseries."
1,A great idea!,"Hey gang, let's pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I'm telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. The cheese, the schmatz, the dishonesty, the cluelessness, the pretention of this flick just begs, begs to be put out of its misery."
2,Disappointing,"Having read Under the Tuscan Sun three times, this movie was very disappointing in the way that a beautiful story became a run of the mill chick flick. As beautiful as the scenery was, the movie made Tuscany lose it's charm and warmth that I received in the book."
5,GREAT ENTERTAINMENT. GORGEOUS MOVIE!,"What a great movie! Entertaining and enjoyable with some very, very funny moments and great acting by Diane Lane. The film is so beautiful to look at on the bigscreen and the story is beautiful and avoids any cliches or sentimentality. A great movie. Very recommnded indeed! 5 stars."
2,YAWN!,"I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book; however, the movie shares only a passing resemblance to the book. It gets 2 stars because I enjoy Diane Lane and Tuscany is gorgeous, but other than that the movie was dull, Lane's character is nothing short of pathetic, and the ending is trite."
4,Enjoyable escapism,"Fun and light but, a bit unrealistic. Just let go and enjoy! Diane Lane and Sandra Oh are great! Linsay Duncan steals the movie!"
1,very much disappointed,"It was just terrible for me, living in Italy for many years now. I hated to see exaggerated stereotyping of Italian men. it seemed to me a real bad Hollywood interpretation of A Room with A View."
2,"Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE storyline","I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual."
1,The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know!,"Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read."
3,It's alright...,Not sure why they made this into a movie as it didn't have anything going on that warrants a whole movie to be made. I found it rather boring compared to other movies of the same genre.
2,"If you read the book, don't watch the movie!","I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me."
2,"If you liked the book, you will not like this film.","Unfortunately, the screenwriter completely changed the story of Under the Tuscan Sun. True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film."
5,"Funny, uplifting, inspiring, beautiful - a GREAT movie!","Under The Tuscan Sun is one of those special films that comes along once in a while. It is funny, uplifting, inspiring, beautiful and above all entertaining. This is one of the most enjoyable films I've seen for ages and the acting by Diane Lane and the lovely scenery make it a modern-day classic! 10 stars!"
5,A guy's persective - actually a GREAT movie!,"As a guy I was not sure if I would enjoy this film or not. It had Diane Lane in it who I like alot. It had good reviews in the newspapers and magazines. But it also didn't really appeal as subject matter AND I had never read the book either. Having said all of that - I did really enjoy this film. It is funny and enjoyable and has a pleasant, uplifting tone to it. Diane Lane was sexy and again gave a great performance like last years 'Unfaithful' for which she was Oscar nominated. The supporting characters in the movie were very entertaining and the Tuscan hills looked spectacular. This is a very good movie that I would recommend even to other guys. Give it a try."
5,Feel good movie!,Love this one and have seen it many times...When you want to watch something sweet and uplifting that makes you smile when it is over - this is the one!
5,High-art!,"I must say, i avoided this movie like the plague for a year. It was deemed to me to be just a sacchrine ""chick-flick."" Now I have to ask myself...what were you waiting for? This movie which I now own, definitely deserves more praise and should be essential to anyone intrested in high-art. It's a magical and uplifting tale set in some of the most beautiful locations in Italy. Diane lane sparkles! She carries the film so well you forget she's only acting. A remarkable movie, filled with poignant characters and a heartbreaking story-line. It's message is one that transcends time and gender. Watch and learn...it's fabulous!"
5,So heartwarming and entertaining. A great comedy!,So entertaining and enjoyable. A masterful and beautiful comedy that is heartwarming and inspiring. Beautifully acted and shot. Wonderful. 5 stars!
4,Very charming warm movie on a cold winter Saturday afternoon,"This movie is very warm toned and sincere. I really give a lot of credit to film makers who can create a romantic comedy that is not contrived and unoriginal. Under the Tuscan Sun is a fresh romantic comedy that has a heart.Of course this is not a masterpiece that will change your perception of life and leave you breathless, but it will leave you smiling for at least a half an hour after it is over.Also, it has a really good point. So many times we force things to happen in our lives and and become totally frustrated in the process. It is indeed so much easier to just ""fall asleep and let the ladybugs crawl all over you"". You will see what I mean when you watch the movie.Highly recommended enterntainment."
5,:( :( :(,I never actually got to watch this movie. It got lost on the trip from my mailbox to my dorm room on campus. I went ahead and gave you 5 stars anyway because I know it would have been in excellent condition.
3,Under the Tuscan Sun,"The movie isTrue-to-lifewhen comes to ""uglyDivorce"" butin Tuscan,Italy magical things happenand ""Happiness"" is aquiredover length of time, thescnery is astouding."
4,Charming surprise...,"This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day."
2,Undercover?,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T.V. while this show was playing out in the family room. The wife got a good night sleep and didn't even bother to replay the part she missed. After complaining, Hollywood Video gave us a comp, so all in all, we felt like we got our money's worth."
4,Diane Lane put on a great performance,I thought this movie was great. If you are one of those that has faith and hope in things this is the movie for you! Diane Lane was great and I hope she gets and Oscar nomination for this roll! My boyfriend even liked the movie which says alot he's picky on everything. If you haven't seen it I suggest you do. I liked it so much it made me want to actually get the book and read it and I am not big on reading books at all.
4,Good flick,"Yes i'm a guy and yes i enjoy chic flicks from time to time,so sue me.This is a good film from Diane Lane(best known for her great performance in Unfaithful)which was also the first flim i recall her having a main staring role.I won't get in to deep to the story but she is a recent divorcy,whom feels she can't go on living in San Fransico,so her 2 gay lesbian friends convince her to go on an all gay trip to tuscan(italy).While there she becomes intrigued by a 300 year old italian home,mind you nothing works,and its in pretty sad shape.So she hires contractor's to help her with her project,and all along the way she runs into various men whom you think she'll develop an attraction to and maybe more but it never pan's out.So thats all i'll give for now,watch for yourself.Although it seems a little slow in places it's an entertaining little piece of film none the less."
1,"Boring, Drawn Out Movie",I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER.
5,Magnificent movie! Diane Lane shines!,"A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie."
4,My husband even liked it!,"This is a beautifully filmed romantic movie about a woman searching for meaning in her life after her life is turned upside down by her husband's infidelity and subsequent divorce. It has moments of humor as well as emotional intensity. It is well acted for the most part with characters that are believable in their parts. And the scenery is truly stunning. My husband accompanied me to see the movie very grudgingly. But he actually watched the entire movie, laughing at the funny parts, and after the movie was over he admitted that he enjoyed it. Children will have no interest in this movie, but it is great for couples."
5,A Must See,A great actress and beautiful scenery. It is good to watch a woman coming into her own and growing strong from from what can be a devistating loss. Women will love this and men should watch it at least once.
5,wonderful movie,"This is a great movie. Views of the Tuscan towns and other scenery make you want to hop on a plane for Italy. The movie content was both funny, entertaining, and a travel advertisement."
5,Italy...Take me away!,"Destined to be a favorite of yours as well, I'm sure. It has everything a chick flick should have...romance, finding strength, empowering substance. If you didn't think you could survive life's pitfalls before...this movie will give you the strength to keep on keepin' on! Funny, entertaining, ensightful and empowering, this movie is a bowl of popcorn and a bottle of wine away from being a classic!"
5,You're missing the point,"Superficially, this movie is indeed sappy. However, look beneath the surface.What I see is that Diane Lane's character is playing the Superego. Sandra Oh plays the ego. And the Fellini Fatale is playing pure ID.They all play their part to explain love, despair, dissappointment and lust.The buying and remodeling an old house is just like cleaning out the cobwebs upstairs. Clean house to move something new in.I believe this movie is made more for what it is representing than what is flat out shows you.It is a good psychological study of the human mind and the ups and downs that it goes through in a lifetime."
2,If it was not for Diane Lane....,"If it was not for Diane Lane, this movie would have been a total loser. It's a swindle. It's advertised as ""romantic comedy"", when there is little (if any) comedy. It's boring, it portrays the Italians with all the cliches available. Blegh!"
2,Tuscany steals the show,"This title was on my Amazon recommended list, and since I never heard of it before I decided to pick it up.In short, I think ANY movie would benefit from being set and shot in Tuscany Italy. This one did. Without the beautiful backdrop - I don't think I would have watched the whole thing. A patchwork story-line, left me with the feeling that it had a lot of interesting bits and pieces BUT it appeared that they were put together for no apparent reason.It just wasn't believable.Maybe rent it"
2,Diane Lane feast...,"Man, hardly have I watched a movie this long (one hour and 53 minutes) that portrays the leading character in every (I mean, every!!) single scene, every single second of the whole movie!This is a bonus if you are a Diane Lane fan (and who is not? The woman is simply gorgeous, besides being a very good actress!), but otherwise youl will be imersed in a chick flick all along, and a bad one by the way, one that will lead you absolutely nowhere."
4,Under The Tuscan Sun,"This is a wonderful movie for those who have experienced loss, pain, and are on the road to the amazing good things that can happen...and do...in life! I loved this movie and just bought a copy for myself and my sister, who is a hopeful (and married) romantic! Very insipirational and moving for me. Would recommend it to my best friend!"
4,Excellent movie,"This movie is for the dreamers of the world. It is not the sappy love story I was looking for, but it was inspiring. Even though it wasn't totally belieavable, it made me feel great about being a woman! Diane Lane is a very wonderful, talented, sexy woman who is a great role model for all women."
5,Great movie!,"Wonderful story about a woman who reclaims her life. Great ""feel good movie"". I love how all her dreams come true!"
1,Terrible movie,"I rented this movie with the highest of expectations due to the things I had heard talked about it, like that it was funny and romantic and had wonderful scenery. What a disappointing story!The story had no sense of direction. It seemed badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."
3,Disappointed,"After reading Frances Mayes two wonderful books, UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN and BELLA TUSCANY, I was very disappointed and felt let down by the film. I found the real Ms. Mayes and her significant other/husband Ed and their real life in Italy much more appealing than the un-real Ms. Mayes (Dianne Lane) and her very un-real life in Italy. The film is eye-candy due to settings and cinematography but if one expects to get the ""real story"" or if the story as presented in Ms. Mayes books is important, forget it."
2,barely cosi cosi (so so),"This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book."
1,under the Tuscany Sun,"Was Very Very disappointed!! Movie though brand new, just out of the box it was stopping all the time during the latter part of the movie."
1,not worthy to be a chick flick,"First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first."
2,"Trite, weak, thin, fake, demeaning,","The story is probably a wonderful love story; but, to get there you must suffer through the paper-thin character of a woman with no depth, no self, no mind..., or an actor who cannot portray a woman worth watching and not worthy of real love."
5,It wasn't that bad!!!,"I don't know, but it seems a lot of people don't like this movie! Why? Because they don't like the feel good feeling at then end? I mean, sure, usually the book is ten times better than the movie, but come on, this movie should be at least a four! When you read a book, and than a movie comes out based on it, don't expect it to be as good as the book, because it very rarely is. Even the movie Lord of the Rings wasn't as good as the book for some people. And if you look at movies like Harry Potter, Ella Enchanted, Bourne Supremacy.... a lot of these movies aren't better than the book. So, if you have read the book, and you are thinking about seeing the movie, my advice to you is try not to expect too much. Think of the movie seperate from the book. By the way, I only rated this movie five stars because I think some people should lighten up, and watch a nice, family movie for a change."
5,"Much more than ""eye candy"" for the ladies!!!","ILOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! THE WIDESCREEN DVD VERSION REALLY TAKES IN THE BREATHTAKING SCENERY, AND THE BEAUTIFUL COLORS IN THE LANDSCAPE. THIS MOVIE REALLY DREW ME IN FROM THE BEGINNING, AND IT REALLY BROUGHT OUT EMOTIONS RANGING FROM SADNESS AT THE BEGINNING OF HER DIVORCE, HAPPINESS IN WHEN SHE BEGINS HER NEW LIFE IN TUSCANY AND MEET THE ""EYE CANDY"", ANGER OVER HOW SHE IS TREATED, AND TEARY-EYED AT THE BITTERSWEET ENDING OF THIS MOVIE. YEP, THIS IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!!!!! I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE!! HAVE NO DISTRACTIONS, RELAX, AND LET TUSCANY TAKE YOU AWAY!!!!"
1,Good Fun?,"This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
5,Beautiful Tuscany,I enjoyed the story and the scenery in Tuscany. It makes you want to visit there!!
3,Feast for the eye,"Great art direction, the sceneries are fantastic, but Diane's acting here is a little lacking. I thought the last scene was a little too superficial."
3,"A cute, light movie","If you just want something to relax with for a couple of hours this is a good movie for that. There were some funny parts, and a few moving parts. I would not consider it a movie about how to re-invent yourself after going through a difficult time, as there are too many unrealistic things that happen here. Definitely not one of the better movies I've seen, but certainly not one of the worst either."
5,Under the Tuscan Sun,"If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico."
4,Romance Italian Style,"This movie is for those who love romance, Italian culture, scenery and Diane Lane who is reeeealy easy on the eyes. This is sweet story about a woman who rises above her emotions and heartbreak to find love with the people and places she finds in Italy. The supporting cast is excellent and the scenery is an artist's dream."
5,Love this movie!,"One of my absolute fav movies. It's so rich looking and makes you want to go to Tuscany. I wish this had come out in blu-ray, the colors would be even more amazing. Watch with a blanket and a bottle of vino!"
4,Diane Lane and Under The Tuscan Sun,"This is a good movie. It had the misfortune of coming out around the same time as Julia Robert's feminist 'Mona Lisa Smile' and being sometimes confused with that film by critics. This is not a feminist, male-bashing movie. And it isn't entirely a 'chic flick' either. Diane Lane is apparently very picky about the roles she plays and the films she appears in. This is another good choice for her.There are plenty of reviews here telling what this film is about. I'll simply tell you that I bought the DVD for my wife, but I usually watch it with her. It is a good movie."
4,Four Stars,"I know the movie isn't the book, with that said, it's a good movie. A movie that revolves around redemption, discovery, and love. In short the pains and joys of life. A life best enjoyed when lived, truly lived! Well acted with stunning photography! Worth the watch, but don't expect this to be a verbatim re-telling of the book... it isn't!"
4,Uplifting and Beautiful,"The scenery in this film was breathtaking- the countryside, the house, the people, the food- the way of life in general was just inspriring.What made this movie great, though, was the romance between Frances and Marcello. In any typical romantic comedy, the broken-down and lonely Frances would have met Marcello and all her problems would have been solved. The end. But in this film, Frances thinks her life has turned around and that she has found the answer to her prayers....but, like in real life, this is not the case.I liked this movie because it didn't sugar-coat anything, but at the same time it was very uplifting."
3,Okay movie,I really enjoyed watching the tv edited version. I was a little taken aback by some of the language.
3,Too much of a good thing,"It has some really nice parts to it....photography, scenery, good character development. Three quarters of the way through, though, I was thinking, ""Where is this going, and will it EVER end?"" I enjoyed much of it, but then it just got too dang long. It was nice the way they brought it around at the end; it just should have gotten there sooner."
1,Make Sure the Format is in Your Region,"I'm such a goof! I automatically assumed that the format of this DVD was for North America Region. I was so excited when it came in, I opend the package and went straight to my player to watch. Opps! I discovered that the PAL format is not readable on my player. Though, I am aware of the many video formats out there, I still assumed that this DVD was just like any other DVD or Blue Ray that I have pruchased.The PAL is for countries like Japan and Europe, I confirmed my findings when I red the back information of the DVD package.Good thing that I have an adopted daughter in France, she will like this DVD. It's just her format! :-)Please be carefule when purchaseing video's on amazon...read carefuly that the format is for your country or else you may end up disapointed."
4,Lightweight but enjoyable,"A review below lists several stereotyped characters in the movie, and to be honest, that's a fair critique. But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a ""Mediterranean"" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichés and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist. I only wish that they had shown the transformation of the villa, a la ""This Old House.""OK, so maybe I also wish they had shown a little more of Ms Lane's body. So sue me for being honest."
1,For MEN only,"maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking ""actress"" who gets to play the ""friend"" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."
1,Boooring.....,This was the most boring movie and the most wretched performance I have ever seen from Diane Lane. All she did was sigh through the first 45 minutes.
4,Under the Tuscan Sun,"Yes, it is a chick flick, but the Italian backgrounds and scenery make you wish you were there. Diane Lane is very easy on the eyes as well. My wife enjoyed it so much she forced me to book us a Mediterranean cruise to Italy for our 30th anniversary."
4,"It was pretty good, but could have been better.","I gave this movie 4 stars because it was a good movie. However, it is quite depressing at times. Diane Lane just can't catch a break. It is kinda slow, but I'm very pleased to have seen it."
5,"A really fun, smart and sexy movie!","This was a GREAT and FUN movie. It was so funny and touching, yet did'nt have the 'cliches'. It was well acted by Diane Lane and it looked fantastic! A great fun movie! Highly recommended!"
5,Not your usual romantic chick flick!,"Determined to rebuild her life after a sudden, unexpected divorce, Diane Lane gets away from it all by going on a gays-only excursion to Italy where she falls in love - with a house! She buys a delapidated villa to renovate and quickly fills it with an engaging cast of characters. She finds her dreams - love (sponsoring star-crossed lovers), her family (her pregnant friend, jilted by her lesbian partner) and finally hopes for a romance of her own. More than just a ""chick flick"" this movie offers a little something for everyone, including exquisite cinematography. Highly recommend!"
5,Tuscan Sun and Diane Lane ==Perfect Match,"I can't say enough positive words about this movie.It was good at the show but like alot of things the second time at home it was so much better. It was a DVD gift from my daughter,and that night I watched it and noticed all the little things you often miss in a large show. As a women I could idenify with Frances in many way's. When she leaves her home she loved and goes to her tempory apartment,and lays down on the floor.. It was Diane's and her best friend performance that you ,the viewer grow to love and laugh with. But the most important message in the movie is that France's positive and helpfull attitude towards everyone is as beautiful as Tuscany."
1,wrong formAt,I may have read the description wong but the DVD won't play. States wrong source. In small letters on the box it says it's the UK version. Can't fiind by receipt so I can't return it. I was really looking forward to sharing it with someone special. :(
4,Subtle and Entertaining,"I thought this was a very good film but I am puzzled by the reviews I have seen here. Some hated this movie but many liked it and yet I wonder how many really got the point? This film could easily have evolved into an Italian Travelog with actors or succumbed to the facile ending, but instead it moved in unexpected directions everytime you seemed to know what would happen next. It really captures the joy and spirit of the Italian people without actually making that a focal point. The handling of the people and the locale were excellent because they never became the actual point of the movie. However, it is the ending that really sets this film apart, because the film builds to the conclusion that you should be careful what you wish for because you just might get it. And as usual when you get what you asked for God has a way of providing it in unexpected ways. I thought this was a subtle and entertaining film. I have seen it twice and enjoyed it both times."
3,Heart in the Right Place,"Review of the film, it just came out in the UK.I came into the theatre with high hopes. I wasn't expectingrealism, I can go see a subtitled Italian film for that,but the endless stream of cliches finally wore down my goodwill. The encounter with Marcello is too rushed and thin.Emma Thompson does a much better scorned woman than Diane Lane.The writing could have been much much better.I was hoping for an Italian Amelie, but left severelydisappointed."
4,Interesting,"Entertaining story. Unfortunately, most people don't have that kind of money to rehab a property in another county. Italy was lucky that someone brought their $$ over to invest & improve their real estate."
5,Under the Tuscan Sun,I saw this on TV & I just had to have it. I just love watching this movie. I watch it every yr :)
1,Dismal,"I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?"
1,Non vero Italia!,"This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy. Cliches abound. Comedy forced. I have disowned all who claim to even mildly enjoy this movie. Questa film e' merda."
1,"If you liked this movie, you might have a brain damage","Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."
1,Italian-American Fairy Tale set in the 21 st Century?,"I should have read the reviews before wasting $10 bucks at BB for this used dvd. I bought it for my wife. She wanted to see it but as I write this review I am watching it with her and we both think this movie is a fairy tale. Please, please...if this movie had any sense of reality I would be the first one to move to Italy. Enough! Read what others have said before me for more specific. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,"Terrible movie, Great scenery","From the onset, this movie was stilted and poorly developed. While Diane Lane is wonderful in some other films, she was(or her character was) irritating at best in this one. The plot is trite, Hollywood drivel. Some of the costuming and lightingwere well-done. I'd like my two hours back. This one is definitely going to be donated to the library where people canbe tortured by it for free -- but not me (again)!"
1,BORING!!!,"I rented this movie while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. By the middle of my movie, I couldn't believe I was still sitting there, and by the end, I wanted my $4.00 back from Blockbuster. The story did not keep my attention and the pregnant friend has got to be the worst actress ever. I do not recommend this at all!"
2,"Cliche city, what was Diane Lane thinking?","Diane Lane is a gifted actress who had just started to come into her own in recent times. I realise that good scripts aren't plentiful for actors over 35, but Diane should have left this one alone. I also have to agree with another reviewer about Diane's facial expressions during this film - quite annoying!Full of every cliche possible, the film does not allow you to think even for a second. On top of that, every scene seemed to be stolen from another movie.The scenery thankfully is the movie's saving grace. Watch it for that alone.Definitely disappointed with this."
2,Gene,"Dated. Doesn't tell ""how to beat the Democrats..."" Old, worn advice. Save your money and buy something else."
5,Canon NB-5L,Great Battery. Last a long time to be depleted. I was going to get another one as second spare when traveling. I don't need it anymore. One is enough. Highly recommended.
5,Long lasting Battery,"I took more than 130 photos in addition to 5 minutes movies all with LCD on without any need to recharge. it is so powerful. the battery is much powerful than the one for SD 750, NB-4L family. 1120 mAh is great."
5,Wonderful...,This battery works like a charm and gives me the same life as the original battery I received from Canon. I bought this as a back up battery and I am extremely happy with it. Ships damn quick. Merchant's service is excellent. Cheers.....
4,Handy Spare Battery,"Worked extremely well with my SD800IS. Bought it as a spare for a weekend getaway. The camera itself gives little notice of a low battery but, the battery itself holds a charge wonderfully. I only swapped the batteries out twice (so, three full charges) and took over 350 pictures over 4 days. Not to mention the price was great for something that I couldn't find locally."
5,Same as original!,"A must have for your SD950IS, because you never know when you need a backup battery!"
4,Adds hours to picture taking expereince,"I switch this battery with the one that came with the camera, so I never miss a shot."
4,Genuine Canon?,"This is the strangest ""retail"" packaging I've ever seen from Canon. The battery functions OK but seems to run down faster than the battery that came with the camera. It's going to get a good test in a couple of weeks and I'll update this report if it performs much worse than the stock Canon battery."
5,Quality battery,I can't imagine not having a spare battery for my camera. I bought this for my 1st Canon Powershot camera and it works exactly as you would expect. I was even more excited when I discovered that my new Canon Powershot uses the same batteries. Now I have 3...the ones that came with each of the cameras plus an extra.
5,Very Very Pleased,Great price on a genuine Canon battery.Reasonable shipping cost.Arrived in reasonable time.
5,Cannon battery,Not much to say it was a true Cannon battery not a generic battery which don't seem to last as long. I had bought generics before and had problems with them retaining the charge after a while. It's worth the cost to have an actual Cannon product. It was sent promptly and it works
3,Extra battery,"I bought this as an extra battery for my new Cannon S100. I have been very pleased with the performance. The battery holds a charge well, charges quickly and has no glitches."
3,Working battery for old camera,"The battery works. Hard to find accessories and batteries for older, still functional digital cameras. For those who need a new battery and see no reason to upgrade their old Canon to a newer digital camera, or use their cell phone, this battery does work. It's a little expensive given how old the cameras they work for are."
2,Not the original Canon battery,"We were surprised and confused when opened up the Amazon shipping box. The battery has been removed from the retail packaging and wrapped in a bubble wrap with a seal labe said ""new"". When looked closely at the battery, it's obvious that this is not the same one as what we have in the camera. I'm not sure if $29.94 is a deal for a non-original battery. We strongly urge Amazon to faithfully update the product description, or this is considered a deceiving."
4,Works great with proper care,"Imagine my surprise when I found the battery in my camera was completely dead and wouldn't even charge. The camera is less than two years old, but I always thought the battery life was great since I rarely had to charge it. That turned out to be misleading however since the guy in the battery shop told me you have to use it from time to time to preserve its life. Since I got a phone with a good camera, I stopped carrying this camera with me and it went for easily a couple of months without any use at all--then I found it stone dead.I was very pleased to find this replacement, but mentioned my experience when I was next in the battery store and learned I hadn't been caring for the original one correctly. I also noted that their version of this battery was a good bit more expensive so I was pleased to have made my purchase on Amazon. Now I know to activate the camera periodically and automatically recharge it after a period of disuse to keep the battery active for longer."
4,Good Quality Battery 44000 pictures taken,This battery was included with my sd 990 years ago. It has been through 44000 pictures with flash always on and only in the last few months before expanding did its charge begin to falter.The best price on these comes from buying used and as long as they have not begin to bulge you should still be able to get good life out of them.
5,Spare Battery for my SD800 Camera,The battery works just as good as the one that came with my camera.
4,item not the same as in the image,"not the genuine canon battery, but usable. the item received does not have ""canon"" on it, just like any replacement battery."
1,Just not the same Quality as Canon Batteries.,"After about a year of using this generic battery from China, the battery is quickly fading away. It will not hold charges and seems to make my camera actually reject the battery. When using this replacement battery, my camera will sometimes shut off or will not even turn on. I will not ever buy a cheap replacement battery for my expensive cameras. China is producing some really bad products lately, using cheap materials and cheap labor. Those products seem inferior to factories from other countries, especial USA, Japan, Germany. You have been warned."
1,Damaged,"Was starting to swell, which was why I was looking for anotherNo more purchases like this from meVery disappointedToo much trouble to follow up and return but glad I can vent"
1,Amazon mix-up,"I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains."
1,Battery does not work with my Canon SD700,"There is a problem with this battery and the Canon SD700. The battery is too short and the fitting in the camera is very loose. This creates a problem since many times the camera does not work, and I need to shake the camera, or remove the battery and insert it back to get the camera powered.I will recommend to the Canon engineers to go out and buy a flashligth to learn how a battery housing should be designed.Very expensive. Made in China. Does not work. Not recommended.Is there any one interested in a used Canon SD700 with an extra battery?"
3,Chris Klein,"Okay basically..... this movie was not that good! Sure, the cars and pink guitar were cool, but that was about it! The best thing about it was getting to look at Chris Klein for 100 minutes. He is a HOTTIE. yup.... i don't know if I'd buy this movie, but the only reason would be to look at Chris Kleins gorgeous face all the time. I never liked Chris Klein before.... but this movie made me change my views. He is just gorgeous. :-) And hes a pretty good actor. Katie Holmes is a lucky girl! lol."
1,THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER! SEEN,I saw this movie in theaters with a friend and my brother. I was expecting a exciting movie but it was exactly NOT that! The movie doesn't make sense and there really isn't a plot. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie!
1,A Confusing Waste of Plastic,"The movie has a vague plot, meaningless items, (like the facial tattoo), and a loud, annoying soundtrack which frequently overwhelms the dialog. The additional injection of non-english conversations, which it only translated occasionally, simply adds to the confusion. No real resemblence to either the novel or the original movie. I'd find 90 minutes of the Shopping Channel more entertaining."
1,"Why, oh why, oh why!","Im begging you now do NOT watch this film at any cost. It is an awful thing (cant bring myself to call it a film) with shoddy acting horrendous set design and one of the most fake, boring scripts ever. If you really want to buy it I suggest purchasing it for the pure pleasure of watching it burn!"
2,Give me the original,"I was surprised and delighted to see this ""remake"". After purchasing I was, well, disappointed. I guess because the framework of the story was the same but nothing else was. The modernisation of the action was poor, the story only Ok and I didn't find it engaging except in one scene. A satisfying ending with all the story nicely wrapped up but I think the cast deserved a better story line and sticking to the original concept and doing a real remake with modern cinema techniques could have made this a four star candidate. Oh well I guess we'll never see a good modern updated version because this certainly is not it!"
1,Why? Oh Why? This is just an outrage.,"The temptation to re-make movies is evidence of the fact that there is little creativity in Hollywood. This movie is evidence that there are people in Hollywood who should not be allowed to go to movies let alone make them.The original is not all that great, but it was in fact original and had some very interesting photography and stunts. This version is insipid to the point of stupidity; the photography stinks, and the stunts are mostly cut-and-paste special effects.The people who made this should be banned from any association to movie making for life! So why did I buy it? By mistake! I had a copy of the original and thought a comparison would be interesting. I was wrong. Learn from my error and avoid this like the very plague."
2,Don't expect much,"The original was original. This was just the same, event the motorcycles were the same from the original. Come on!"
1,Far Cry From Original,Don't waste your time or money on this remake. Even Rebecca's hotness can't save it. Watch the original with James Caan.
3,Not that bad actually,"Everyone REALLY seems to hate this film, but I think it's a pretty entertaining film. I can't compare it to the original film because I haven't seen the original, so I judged on it's own merits. The Rollerball scenes are suitably chaotic and exciting, Klein, Stamos and LL make for pretty good leads(though I didn't like how LL's character was suddenly rmeoved from the film) and Jean Reno is good as the over-the-top villain and the story is compelling enough, only downside is sometimes the directing is just weird looking, like that night-vision car chase near the end, but other it's a pretty entertaining film."
1,travesty remake on bluray? original not even on anamorphic dvd?,"The old saying hollywood never lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people really hits you in the groin with this head shaker of a release.While the orignal classic rollerball hasn't even gotten an anamorphic dvd release, let alone a blu-ray!"
1,"Great movie, if you have the mind of a 10 year-old","The setting for this movie is not in the future!!!! It is current day, and takes place in a poor European country. The arena they skate in looks like a very cheap prop from American Gladiators. There is VERY LITTLE SPECIAL EFFECTS and no high tech equipment.15 minuets of the movie is done with a night vision camera, so everything you see is either dark green or picth black.Most of the action happens within the rollerball arena. There are only a few action sceens on the streets of the city."
1,"Rollerball ROCKED In Theatres,...","""Rollerball"" in theatres was an awesome, bone-crunching, action-packed movie! But once it got on video & DVD...they added in nudity & took out scenes. It was terrible. The camera work was even altered when it came on video. I wouldn't have mind if they at least put the theatrical version on video too... bet they didn't! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?"
2,What went wrong with this film?!,"This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser."
1,Horrible stupid movie,"Nothing more to say, this is one of the worst movies ever. Bad script, stupid story, terrible shooting, boring acting. I highly don't recommend this title."
3,So why remake rollerball?,"The brave new world isn't about 'fake' blood andstunt-men...Rollerball is a deadly contact sporteven simulated for the camera. Sort of a dirtierversion of world wrestling and it appears theother reviewers don't have a stomach fortelling it like it is becoming.Violence and sex in the media has gotten all out of handand this remake shows the level of escalation?The Romans had bread, gladiatorial games and circuses,we have TV. American social decline recorded in video for allthe generations to come to see? I think maybe vampire moviesand this one have a common ground ofblood drinking?"
1,R?,"What the heck? This movie is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I'm not allowed to get or see this movie, which was only mediocre to begin with. Great job!"
3,I Kinda Liked It!,"While certainly this film is no contender for a Best Picture Academy Award, I found it an enjoyable picture, certainly better than many I've seen this year on DVD. The film's opening sequence is enough to get your adrenaline pumping just watching it, as Jonathan luges through the hilly streets of San Francisco.Once the movie goes to Asia, it isn't exactly as much of a pulse-pounder, and certainly a lot of the material is formulaic. Still, unlike ""The Mummy Returns"" or ""The Scorpion King,"" this film actually has a plot, not just special effects. Turns out to be a pleasant piece of mind candy. I have never seen the original, so I'm not sure how this film stands in comparison. But on its own merits, there are worse ways of wasting two hours of your time."
1,Appalling,This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE! DO NOT BUY!,"This movie was one of the worst films I've seen in years. The script is horrible, the movie had little glitches on it, and a big scene of the movie is shot in night vision (GREEN!) If you are thinking of buying this movie, read this review. I'd give this movie 0 stars, but the minimum is 1 star."
1,The Worst Movie Ever!,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen! The plot was impossible to follow, the action confusing and flashy, and the film editing awful. For example, there is one sequence in which a motorcycle crashes through a chain link fence and the sound effect boingongong is heard, like a spring snapping. Ridiculous! Concept - Terrible, Acting - Worse, Execution - Rollerball looks like it was made in 2 weeks using 2 computers that didnt work. I reccommend that you see this movie, just so you can tell your friends you've seen the worst movie ever made!"
1,Top Ten Worst Movies I ever Saw,"This is somewhere up there as one of the worst movies I ever saw. Its not hard to find faults in this movie because its full of them.I was horrified by how poorly the first rollerball game scene was shot. It was so uninteresting and almost impossible to follow what was going on that it was PATHETIC. There was no doubt in my mind after the first fifteen minutes that this was the worst intro to a film I had ever seen.It got somewhat better as the weak plot developed and there was less action shots of them playing this ridiculous game.I normally end with something positive, but there was none. NONE at all.I must admit to watching the whole thing... a sucker for punishment. I would never watch it again, and could never recommend this film to anyone.A real letdown"
1,Little to say about this embarrassing film...,"Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did. Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch. Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it. The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate. This is one of those films that offer us absolutely nothing.I have nothing else to say about this."
2,BALLISTIC BOMB,"This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it. Director John McTiernan, who did so well with DIE HARD, blasts us with heavy metal rock garbage throughout the entire movie, action scenes that are incomprehensible and lifeless, and a cast that fizzles from the start. Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things. It makes no creative sense and adds nothing to the overall movie.Remakes like this add further validity to the fact that if you're going to remake a movie, either make it as good or better, or let us savor the originals."
1,"Umm, I don't know what they were trying to do","This movie is just plain sad. In addition to mediocre acting, the special effects were just as bad. In one scene you could plainly see the safety wire connected to the motorcycle. Bad diologue and senseless nudity made the film even worse. The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J. His on camera presence is always rather captivating to me. It also carried him through a poorly written character. Since most of the movie took place on the track, there was more of the game than I could really put up with. Avoid it."
1,The pits,"A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."
4,I Hope I'm Not Allergic To It!,"I ordered this, based on the reviews. I ordered on 11/16, and received it on 11/21 (I needed it by 11/29). I love the musky smell. I only tested 1 drop on my wrist. I have to say that after a couple of hours, the smell turned into a strong sex smell... not bad, but definitely sex. I'm going to test it out at work next week, but the real test is on 11/30. I'll report my findings then.12/6/12: It works! This is definitely going to be my ""go-to"" scent. It drove my man crazy! I love it. I will purchase again."
3,I have not looked at yet,Seems few people looked at it. I will give it a try if I have time and see how it works.
2,uggh!,I ordered this border for my new twins nursery! It is truly a cute colorful boarder. I was so excited to find it a a great price! Now i know why!I had one whole roll on the wall and neither of the other 2 rolls would match up to the one i already had on the wall! The borders were different widths! Which throws off all the lines on the border!I even checked the lot numbers on the packaging and they all matched? I had to get very creative to make it work since I already had a whole roll on the wall! very frustrating!
5,so easy to use,love this kettle looks and works beautiful. I have no p;roblem with it being remanafactured have many other ones I higly reccommen d this to perk up anyones kitchen
3,found it on the ground when I was 13!,"Pretty good actually, a comp though. That means ofcourse there is some great moments and some less than great. found it as a cassette when I was 13 years old on the ground broken apart, decided to fix it up with tape and whatever. Was getting into metal, and was very curious about hearing more. to me at that point it sounded very evil and maybe even satanic a little. It was a little scarry to listen to! since then I spread way out into Jazz, classical, fusion, brittish invasion, but these tunes we're some of the first metal I heard that wasn't hair metal, and it is still pretty cool! I didn't even know that was Flotsom And Jetsom! Guess they were always good.Peter"
4,Jane's Chem-Bio Handbook: A useful tool,"Among those involved with the planning and implementation of specialized, multi-casualty incident response, this book is quite useful. Field personnel, command staff, and planners - all will find it helpful. I found it to be concise, packable, and physically handy. About the only thing I'd change would be to laminate the pages for weather resistance.R.D. Lopez, Emergency Medical Services and Disaster Specialist, Dept. of Public Health"
5,The Pledge of Allegiance,This book is beautifully illustrated with photographs that are sure to spark discussion. The text (the Pledge of Allegiance) is broken into meaningful phrases that make the reader reflect on the words that we sometimes rush through or take for granted. I highly recommend purchasing the big book version for lower grade classroom use. A gem!
5,Beautiful photos,"The text is the spoken pledge, and the photos show America -- the people and places and landmarks. Beautiful photos -- did I already say that?Facts at the back -- every family with a kindergartener should be equipped with this book."
4,Nice,"The book is just what the title states, the pledge. Which I think is a must in all libraries. Our schools are cutting corners and teaching American history is made that much richer with the book."
4,ill joint!!!!,"When i bought this album I expected it to be a bangin joint and when I played it....all I can say is that its tight. You gotta check out joints like ""Imagine That"", ""Take It Off"" and ""Fuhgidabowdit"". Other ill joints are ""Farmers"" and ""Hello"" what the heck every song is fresh. This is way better than his previous joint ""Phenomenon"". Get this one, it sure is butta...its great to see the one of tha greatest back in tha game!!!!"
5,Friend of the author,"I work with Hank Hassell at NAU and know him as a friend and kind and unassuming person who, from what I've gathered, can hike the doglegs off anyone. This book is the offspring of his love for the Colorado Plateau area. It is a well told story of a piece of our geological heritage that could only be written by someone who has been there and done that. I would recommend this book for the academic community as well as for travel buffs. Betty Lee/Library Specialist @ NAU"
2,Disappointed,"I love the box, and even the pictures on the box that the dragon is supposed to look like, you know like ""see-through"" clear blue plastic. Unfortunately, it looks like its made from some sort of tubberware material.The electronic sounds (2 and not in any sequence),one sounds okay/good, the other sounds like the flushing sound on my daughters potty book. The eyes look like round paper decals and looks...wierd. I'm sure my 6 yr old son would like it, just because its YU-GI-OH, but I'm a fan too and was excited about getting this for him for XMAS......I'm glad I started early, I can return it for something else."
1,What the????,"It is jut an action figure you build and then you let it sit on the floor for months until it is stepped on. What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!"
2,This machine makes as much noise as a power tool,"All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive. These guys must have used a cheap hard drive or something. I have the Amazon return slip on my desk......"
2,When Good Products Go Bad,"I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that, not the manufacturers). After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives. I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line (533/633) to buy a better one. Don't know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product."
4,Some problems but worth it,Overall I like the dvr but it has a few quirks.(1) It is nosiey(2) No sleep mode that I have been able to find(3) No mute button on the remote(4) It is slow (It has taken about 90 seconds just to power off and it take 10 to 15 seconds to pull up the tv guide)Overall I would buy it again. I would much rather deal with the quirks of tv guide on screen than have another monthly payment by getting tivo.
1,Hassles galore!,"We bought this last December (2005). It worked well enough for the first few months (some resetting of the TV Guide and blanking for days at a time, but OK). Was great to backup our Digital 8 video tapes to DVD.THEN...two weeks ago the TV Guide went dark (could not use it at all). I left it alone thinking it would reset and be fine.Machine then went into an endless loop the other day when I tried to turn it on. Would not come on. Gave a ""LOADING"" message when powered on - then went off to EPG function - then fired up again to ""LOADING"" then to EPG - etc. It seems to be frying.Read elsewhere on the web that the TV Guide function has been a disaster for almost all users. New version does not include it!Pioneer asked us to ship it to them and they will repair it under the 1 year warranty. Frankly, I feel it is a lemon and should be replaced with the new version under a lemon law for bad electronics!Buyer beware!"
1,A Note about Charles Taze Russell,"It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses."
1,I used to eat it till I found out how it was made,"diseased yellow pile of tortured meat, that's what it is. I used to eat it... but than I found out how it's made, that's just gross. people are disgusting and will eat raccoon's a* on a stick if it's called a delicacy."
1,Who eats Fois Gras?,"So, Amazon, you're back to selling whale meat, fois gras, and other gross foods? What gives? Is it because few American's eat it, or even know what it is? And, it's expensive which helps your bottom line. So, why not take stuff American's don't or are forbidden to eat (remember the ban on whale slaughter is now world wide and it makes your selling of it illlegal). People are becoming more informed on a daily basis, and finding this kind of stuff on Amazon is little less than appalling, much less, law disregarding."
4,You Don't Need a Math Degree to Understand this,"Chaos is such a visually stunning field of study, since you invariably run into those computer generated figures of Julia sets or random fractal landscapes or cloud formations.But can we get a rigorous, first principles explanation that is broadly accessible to undergraduates with good, but not advanced math preparation? Well, you might consider this recent book. The authors have gone to some length to explain events without appealing to more than simple calculus.Nothing flashy. But you can obtain a good understanding of fractal dimensions, self iterating systems (like a Sierpinski gasket) and noise."
4,VHS tape of Vital signs,"Fun movie, but the tape quality listed as ""NEW"" has faded colors- VHS tapes just don't hold up. Arrived on time and otherwise in excllent condition"
4,Vital Signs,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. Ive had it on VHS for years and am glad that I was able to find on DVD. Im a sucker for medical, and romance, this offers both."
2,"Cheap. OK value for $9, but not a cent more.","Poor quality fabric, not soft like flannel should be. But was only $9 and it's for my guest bed, so I guess it's OK."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I was extremely disappointed with the fabric and color when it came. It is obvious that it is of poor quality but I guess you get what you paid for 10 bucks.The zipper of the plastic cover of one set was broken.I bought 2 queen sheets and I wanted to return both purchases if only I did not have to pay for shipping.Do not buy this!!!! You will regret it.
4,Sheets are great considering price,I think these are great they're nice and soft. That being said I'm not as picky as others. Picky abpit certain things but sheets aren't one of them!
3,Review of Melrose Home Red Floral Paisley Sheets,The sheet color was inconsistant. The top sheet's background color of goldish/tan was much darker than the bottom sheet's background color. I'm assuming they came from diffenent dye lots.
1,i got it cheap and it is Cheap !!!,"I did not like the product, but i got it really cheap . This is not a quality product , avoid at higher prices"
2,Disappointed except for price,"I had high hopes for these sheets even though I got them at a bargain price. They don't have elastic all around, which is a problem with flannels resulting in sheets riding up on the sides. They are also inexpensively made with MANY loose threads and potential for unraveling. They are thin as flannels go. All in all, try to find a better quality sheet.... it's well worth it!!"
2,Elastic is falling out of the fitted sheets.,"I bought 3 sheet sets, I have noticed on the two queen size sheets that the stitching that holds the elastic in has come apart in several places and the elastic is now falling out. I have only washed these sets two times. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
2,"Great Price, But......","I ordered these sheets hoping for that comfy flannel sheet I remembered from the old days. Snuggling under the covers in the Fall and Winter, cosseted by soft sheets. Perhaps, I was too optimistic, given the price.These sheets seem to be fairly good quality, but they don't have that fuzzy softness of flannel. There's really not much nap. They are made of a low thread count sort of jersey fabric. The patterns are good, and they come packaged nicely, but in an era where high thread count sheets are available affordably, these sheets are a disappointment.If you like jersey-type sheets, and you aren't too concerned about the softness right out of the package or the thread count, these could be just right for you. And you can't beat the price."
3,Thank goodness I only paid $9.99 for these sheets!,"These sheets are very light weight in a cheap way. Since I paid so little for them, it is cheaper to keep them rather than pay return postage. I haven't bothered to even use them yet so I can't say how they are to sleep in/on. If I could do it all over again, I'd spend a little more money and buy sheets that are better than these."
2,Seamingly poor quality,"The pillow case seam tore wide open after initial washing (before I even used the set!). I stitched back up and the rest of the set seems fine. Could just be an anomoly, but beware. But then again, they were only $20."
4,"VERY CUTE,NICE SHEETS FOR THE PRICE",I BOUGHT THIS SET FOR MY 10 YEAR OLDS BED & SHE GETS TONS OF COMMENTS ON THEM.THEY ARE VERY COMFY & VERY WARM.SHE LOVES THEM!!THEY ARE A GREAT SET FOR THE PRICE
3,Not very soft,"The sheets are pretty, but the quality is lacking. Not as soft as most flannel sheets. I would buy these for the kids or for camping (which is what these will be used for now) but not for my every night bed. The comfort and softness is just missing."
1,Not really a bargain--terrible sheets,"Dollar store quality. Lovely dark pattern, but it is printed on thin white flannel, not over-printed on blue yarn-dyed fabric, and the stitching on these fairly dark sheets is white."
2,These sheets will self-destruct...,"The hems on the flat sheet became unraveled after the very first wash, not just in a few places, but the full length on both sides! However the fabric is soft to the touch and the price was insanely low, so I gave it a courtesy second star."
3,Not alotta Bang... but not alotta Buck,"$10, come on! Asian children must have really sweated these out. Labor concerns aside, these sheets do the job and are worth the $10. However, no one in their right mind would pay the retail price if they felt them first hand.These are soft enough but nothing about them is at all luxurious. The top sheet runs narrow and quite long and the pillow cases are on the small side. The sheets do fit my queen size futon and average size pillows but I'd recommend getting the King size and just shrinking them some in the wash.The print is nice, I was pleasently suprised, the earthtone colors keep it from being way too girly. With a green or blue cover these could look classy and even work well for a man."
2,Flannel Sheets -- Not Recommended,"Even at the incredible Friday sale price of $4.99, I would not recommend these flannel sheets for purchase because of the very poor sewing workmanship. The stitches were very large, and also some of the edges were simply turned over once and sewn with a raw (easy to unravel) edge. The sheet would not hold up well after the first washing. I resewed all the edges of both sheets."
4,Sheets OK - package/label looks really cheap.,"The sheets seem fine but the packaging looks like something you would see at ""Dollar General"". They come off looking very cheap - not a big deal at all really unless you are giving them as a gift."
4,One of my all-time favorites,"This movie is not for everyone, but I love the absurd humor. Every character in it is irrational in some way. Where films today would probably mock the characters in a mean way, this film has more of a sad and sweet acceptance of their eccentricities. It respects the courage of human beings who have obviously been damaged by the hardships of life but still continue to muddle through. Just like real life."
2,Another Warners Archive Collection Bust,"As with They Only Kill Their Masters, another recent purchase, this DVD is from the Warners Archive Collection. Here is the statement from this website concerning this title:Important Note: This film has been manufactured from the best-quality video master currently available and has not been remastered or restored specifically for this DVD and Digital Download release. Click here to preview this film's video quality.Had I realized this fact, I would not have purchased this DVD from Amazon."
4,great toy,the toy is pretty awsome. it is a lot of fun and really cool. the only problem is that the batteries die really fast.
4,Megaman Pet,"My kid was looking this toy for a long time since this is not produced anymore and it is more like a colectible. We are happy to finally got it. It is working properly. Looking at the picture of the original toy looks like a feature is missing(like a cover that protect the screen)Anyway I am happy with the toy and with Amazon service.Best regards,Arturo Garcia Arias"
5,my first REAL netbattle,this PET is so cool. after I got it I started buy battlechips and fight my bro. then for some reason my computer had a virus. so I went in with megaman. Thank goodness that I had the right chips or I would have been deleted. And it was all thanks to my favorite battle chip...........TIME BOMB. Now my computer is safe.
1,This toy is the WORST!,"This toy is the worst! You can't even get past the Password screen to play anything. I got tricked that it was a good toy, but it's not. And I don't want you to get tricked, either. I thought it was a good toy by looking at it in the wrapper, but it wasn't."
2,The batteries died after less than one day!,"I bought a couple of these for my sons. They love to play with them, but after only a few hours of use, the batteries are dead! This could get really expensive considering the batteries are about $3 each. Also, one thing that gets very irritating is the shaking of the PET that has to be done when you get a ""virus"". Very annoying!"
3,Megaman not as mega as thought,This toy is ok for a cheap version I would try the more expensive one it may hold up better. We had to return the first one due to defect but customer service was very prompt in replacement and the replacement is still doing good. I could not beleive how easy the exchange was I was really amazed they shipped it right out within two days. My daughter is 13 and seems to enjoy this game so I guess if she is still using it then it is a fun toy.
1,I hate useless products,"You have to buy most of the battle chips seperatly which leeches your cash in no time, don't bother. Get a Game Boy or a Nintendo DS if you want handheld fun."
1,junk junk junk,"it has terrible graphics i mean it is just black and white.also it moves very slow on the screen.that is what little of a screen it has.(...)i say get av gameboygame instead.at least that has decent graphics and isn,t a cheap piece of plastic.overall it is a piece of junk."
5,The Best Handheld Game Ever,I just recently got the megaman pet and it is a lot of fun. I play with it all the time and i am 13 years old. The only problem is that you only get battle chips through the toys. When you by the pet you only get 3 battlechips. The game is easy and hard to play.I think it is the best game ever
2,peice of garbage!!,Okay this game was pretty fun when I first bought it but after that it just wasnt fun anymore. the thing has no plot but fight viruses and enter tournaments which are VERY hard. Plus there is quite a bit of shaking for an electronic game.
3,For the Megaman lover,"My 9 year old got this for his birthday and he was very excited. He just loves Megaman. But he played with it for a few days and that was it. He said that you really need to have two so that you can battle each other.Also, something we did right away that I would also recommend was to tie the chips together with the toy so that they don't get lost."
2,Didn't perform as expected,It doesn't cooperate and isn't very user friendly. It feels like it takes forever of shaking until it finally finds a virus for you to fight. Very annoying...especially when mom is fussing at me to stop shaking it.
3,Disappointing,"I bought two of these for my kids. You have to shake the PET to get into ""virus"" mode. The first day, the first one didn't work. A day later, the other one doesn't acknowledge the battle chip. Also, the cover broke off. I returned one, and considering returning the other. Save your money on this one."
4,People...,"The Plug-In PET is not coming to America. The season of NT Warrior is already over, Axess is airing now. They would have brought the Plug-In to America before the Adanced PET. It wouldn't make sense to make the Advanced PET while NT Warrior is showing, then make the Plug-In while Axess is.The Plug-In is extremely rare. I have one, don't buy it. The battle system is terrible, and the battery dosn't last that long.Either buy this PET, or buy the Progress. I have both. The Progress is the best out of all..."
1,Not a good toy,This toy isn't well made or designed with kids in mind. You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.
4,Reveiw #7,"Yes, it's me again. I have a right to do so. Anyways, there are some people out there who I noticed are complaining that MegaMan is in ProtoMan's PET. Well, on toywiz.com (I'm not trying to sponser them or trying to get people to go there), they sell the Japanese version of the PET, and it will actually give you ProtoMan if you choose the red PET. They also sell battle chip booster pack, single chips, and the original PET found in MMBN 1-3. My PET is the English version, but I think there's something wrong with the battery. The manual says it's due to low power, but it occured only 6 hours after I bought the product. I'm gonna check with a new battery, and my advice with the Attack+10 is wrong, it obliterates only Lvl 1 Mettaurs, Billy's, Volgear, and ""Shumps"" (those things that look like shrimp). Everything else will just lose a lot of HP."
5,I love this book!,"I'm a big fan of Vickery's ever since I read his previous book, Cocksure. I have to say that as good as Cocksure was, Play Buddies is even better! Not only are his stories hot, Vickery writes with real humanity, making his characters come across as real and three dimensional, out on the prowl, looking for sex wherever they can find it. As far as erotic writing goes, Vickery is a master!"
4,Very sexy,I'm not gay or male but I do enjoy Bob Vickery. His stories always gets my juices flowing. I will definitely read more from him.
3,"Not bad for the money, but not my first choice","For the price you can't beat it I guess. The color I chosen was definitely brighter than I expected. It's ok though since I bought it as a backup shirt for work. It's also thinner than most polo's and it's probably why it's lower in price than most. I wouldn't buy this color again, but might consider another color if the price is right."
4,You can feel the poly,"You definitely feel that it is not 100% cotton but for the price it is still a great shirt. They are lite enough that I just wear a cotton tank underneath so don't feel the poly so much. They do shrink a bit, but not too much, I typically get shirts in XL so when the shrink they fit right. These almost didn't shrink enough. Probably after a few washes they will. I wear a 42-44 jacket as a reference."
4,Jerzees Polo,I like the feel of the material and that it is by Jerzees.I recommend it to family and friends.
3,Not nearly as good as they used to be.,"Good job for a newly reformed band, but still needs work on their structure."
5,Great album!!!,"This album is the best release of the ""New Mayhem"". Total insane, brutal black metal. Only for people that like primitive raw black metal. Hellhamer plays in an incredible way, necrobutcher give an atmospheric sound to the tracks, and maniac voice is totaly inhuman. WLA is a must have.!"
5,"""MARLOWE BY ANY OTHER NAME WOULD BE JUST AS TOUGH""","For you hard-boiled detective fans who are also intogeneology, you might like to trace Philip Marlowe's familytree. Raymond Chandler's prototypes for his now famous detective began in the mid-30's with characters from some of his early pulp magazine stories. Whether the character is Ted Carmady, Johnny Dalmas, John Evans, Tony Resick or a character named simply Mallory, they all had the qualities and charactoristics that eventually evolved into what became Philip Marlowe. Red Wind, Trouble Is My Business and Goldfish are just three of more than 40 stories Chandler wrote during his lifetime. Don't miss a single one!"
3,Not finding the Drifters classic recording?,"If you're looking for the wonderful Doo-Wop classic recording of White Christmas by The Drifters, it's the feature track on the ""White Christmas and Other Doo Wop Christmas Classics"" CD, also available on Amazon."
5,What a debut!,"This album was not death metal or even thrash metal by today's standards. It was, however, an incredible debut that I ended up owning on cassette, album form, and finally, CD. Unfortunately, Nasty Savage sounded best when they werent trying to be heavy. Some bands do (Metallica, Possessed come to mind immediately), just check out the incredible original version of XXX (available on Metal Massacre 6) and then listen to the much faster, more aggressive, and much less interesting version on the CD 'Indulgence' and see what I mean.)This album is actually very good ""idontknowwhatyouwouldcategorizethisstuffas"" metal for this time period. For some reason, they decided to use more death metal growls and faster beats on future records and that made them sound like they were trying to do too much....This album is their crowning glory."
1,Not appropriate for 9 yr olds,My very athletic 9 yr old absolutely could not use this - much too hard - returned it.
2,wrong trikke in box,"I purchased this Trikke thinking that it would be a great surprise for my son on his birthday. When I received the Trikke it was missing two pieces. This Trikke came in a box that didnt match the product. It does not fold down at all which makes it hard to pack for trips etc... I am very dissappointed in this product and Razor company should get a great big slap for false advertising. The advertisment also does not state the weight capacity, its say both kids and adults can enjoy this product. The weight capacity is only 175lbs. It does not come with an owners manual, and there is no tool case. The allen wrenches come in a plastic baggie taped with scotch tape. Very Very disappointed."
1,Good for downhill only,"I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars. Don't be fooled, this only good for down hill. While it is well built, you can't propel this trike as advertized. Save your money, don't buy this!"
5,"The new ""rage"" in our hood","After a neighbor girl got one for her 6th birthday, my 7 year-old son had to have one for his (birthday). He got it today as a group gift from several families and he loves it. The Trikke across the street was labled ""Trikke"", but my son's says ""Razor"", but they seem to be almost identical. My son is very athletic and took to it right away, but he has been riding his regular Razor (two wheeler) for over 2 years now. The brakes are a little tight, but my husband is just stretching the cords for a smoother brake...which I'm told is common with new brakes.We live in a hilly area, but he seems to have no problem adjusting to the ""squirlliness"" of the Trikke."
2,Not what we thought,"From pictures, etc., we thought this trike somehow had a means of locomotion - swaying back and forth? My determined child never figured it out, and instructions never hinted to a technique. So, it ends up being a scooter that is not very functional because it's hard to balance on one side and scoot with the other foot."
5,MY PERSONAL FAVORITE BOOK BY MY PERSONAL FAVORITE AUTHOR!!!!,"This book is amazing! It provides us with great humor while taking a serious look at religion as a whole. Personally I think the Great God Om is the best character on the whole Discworld (followed by a close second of Rincewind and then Death bringing up third place) and I hope to see him again sometime soon, maybe in another Discworld book(of course). This book also has the best villian in the whole series as far as I'm concerned...he was really truly an evil man. In short...I LOVED IT!!!!!"
4,"Not at all what you'd expect from fantasy, but...","still well worth reading, whether you are looking for something light to take the edge off a long day at work or something a little heavier to pose a few interesting questions. Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a ""British"" or an ""American"" feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent."
4,Do the gods make man or does man make the gods or ....,"I've read quite a few of the Pratchett books, mostly at the insistence of my 13 year old son who loves these novels. This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read."
2,Not Prachett's best by a long shot.,"Terry Pratchett's other books are a lot like well painted homes. There are several layers. ""Small Gods"" is like inviting over your friends to paint. There is one uneven coat of paint and they left masking tape on all of the edging in an unsuccessful attempt to miss it with their paintbrushes. The ending of the book (and middle and beginning too if truth be known) left me with the same vague feeling of dissatisfaction as when I realized that to get the place properly painted I would have to have another seperate group of friends and throw another 'paint party'."
5,A good basis for religion,"It is just as entertaining and well written as all the other Discworld Novels. The basic philosophy about the nature of religion is brilliant; it is much more credible and closer to reality than the official dogmas of most of the existing religions. Actually, it is quite close to Nordic paganism (as practiced in Iceland), traditional Shinto (not the official version practiced by the Japanese state) and religious Taoism."
5,Best of the Best,"I've read nearly all of the Disc World series and have thoroughly enjoyed most of the ones I've read. SMALL GODS holds a special place in my heart. The characters are engaging. Om as a little turtle won me over completely. Brutha, the naive is one I could relate to. What a villian Vorbis! Pratchett is at his best with his usual terrific humor, but in addion -- and upon rereading I keep discovering this -- there is much much more to this story. It invites us to think and to question. If you only want to read one Terry Pratchett story I recommend SMALL GODS."
1,Why do people like this garbage?,"Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking. My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand."
3,Its not a waste of time to read this book.,"Although I did not love this book, I did get something from it. It was an okay read. Fast enough, Cute enough, Smart Enough. But it was not a book that I fell in love with or would even recommend.I have read a few others books by Pratchett and I can not say that I have enjoyed any of them. This was the one that I had the easiest time with. I do not plan on reading any other, I gave it a chance and after 3 books and this one I decided its not my taste. Its just not for me."
3,"Not as good as interesting times, but still a good read!!","I agree with the concept of polythesim, where there may be more than one god, and also the fact that the gods get their power from the belief of their worshipers. Although some people may find this book satanic or blasphemous this is not the case - pratchett treats the whole thing with a sense of sarcasm, and does not take himself seriously - although quite witty in places, I think this book is better suited to the avid prattchett fan!!"
4,"Typical Discworld, but with a better story than most","Let me just say I'm not a big fan of Discworld. I can't give any solid reason for that, but it has never quite captivated me the way it does so many. Pratchett's writing is very good, and his world entertaining, but well . . . I don't know. Just doesn't do much for me. Maybe too much satire, not enough story.""Small Gods"" is different. It has a pretty good story. And the end is very satisfying. This is one of the first Discworld books I read, and it's still my favorite. Admittedly, I haven't read many, so take that with a grain of salt.It does drag a bit, and once in a great while, Pratchett is more convinced of his cleverness than he should be. But usually he's justified. When it comes right down to it, he is one of the best at humorous fantasy that still has something worthwhile to say."
5,Simply Extraordinary,"If you have the slightest inkling that you have what it takes to be a professional author, do not read Terry Pratchett. This is not because he's not worth reading, or because I don't think that aspiring writers can learn anything from his prose: that is patently false. Do not read Terry Pratchett because one chapter in, you will feel like a kid with a toy xylophone staring at Beethoven at the head of a symphony. Pratchett is one of the truly great writers today, with vivid imagery and beautiful wordplay that is unparalleled. In Small Gods, Pratchett follows the Discworld version of the Spanish inquisition, and creates a story that managed to make me laugh in the same chapter that it caused me to genuinely think about the nature of religion, belief and faith. I know I'm using hyperbole, and I know I'm raving to a ridiculous extent. But Small Gods earns the praise."
4,"""Small Gods"" is literature","I expected a lesser Douglas Adams; after all, it was only a Terry Pratchett novel, one of those things with pages that you read quickly, laugh a couple of times and change for any other book on those second-hand stores.But ""Small Gods"" is a thing of beauty, of seemingly superficial thoughts that nevertheless takes you to the depths of the human condition. Pratchett mayve even did not intended to reach the heights of art, but here the attempt has succeded, and we could well be in the presence of a minor classic.Here you have a book that explains how Gods are made and destroyed, not in a fantasy world, but in our very real one, deux-ex-machina and all."
2,Boring plot.,"I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic."
2,"Finally, a let down","I have read most of this series with great delight. However, Pratchett finally let me down.It plods along, in no particular hurry to let the reader move on to better things.The humor -- what little there is of it -- is forced. It has the feel of sophomore philosophy majors sitting 'round the Quad on a Saturday night, dateless and full of mockery. It is kind of sad.Far from one of his best. PYRAMIDS, any of the series having to do with the Watch or the wondrous three witches -- you will enjoy those far more.This one droops as limply as an Ayn Rand novel."
2,"Interesting Ideas, Poor Presentation","While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the ""REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE"" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."
2,simply not that funny,"The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)"
2,a disgrace to religion,"although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett."
5,A grim and gritty travel masterpiece,"Tabasco and Chiapas in the 1930's - not a nice place either to live or to visit. Greene's explorations provided background and some characters for his great short novel or tale, The Power and the Glory. If you are a student of fine writing, read the novel first, then read this to see how he gathered and used material. Or read this first for background that adds depth to the novel. If you are an armchair traveler or student of Mexico, enjoy Greene's adventures and be grateful he went through them so you don't have to do it yourself. This is truly a classic of travel writing."
3,Cute but...,"Its not surgical steel, its like. chrome or something. It totally rusted!!! But it looks cute none the less."
1,The worst mess ever,"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!! This was delivered in three boxes and was bound by plastic wrap. Once out of the box, the three layers were cut with what looked like pinking shears and were horribly uneven. This was NEVER a mattress that sold for 999.00 ... When I tried to return it All Sleep was helpful at first but I could not package the layers to send. While trying to come up with a solution to the shipping problem, the UPS labels they sent to me expired and now they will not return any emails or calls. WORST SERVICE AND PRODUCT EVER!"
1,Spend your money better,This book is a total waste of money; it is only useful for lighting up the BBQ. The only one to make (plenty?)of money out of this book is the writer. Do not be discouraged by the title!. This is not a serious book.
1,tbone,thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.
4,Anastasia Rocks,The CD is great. Every song has its own personality and that makes the entire CD very diverse. I especially love the mixes on the second disc.
5,Awesome voice,"I discovered Anastacia on you tube and fell in love with her music. I love the CD, especially the track ""I belong to you"" and ""everything burns"". There isn't a song on the CD that I don't like. Why she is not more popular in the US is beyond me."
5,It really is the Gluten free Bible,Packed with great information.Great for people like myself just diagnosed with Celiac Diseasefunny friendly fact filled! The one recommended by my nutritionist!
3,Everything you need to know about gluten free living,This book is excellent for web sites to order gluten free products plus it has links to go to for support.
1,Terrible!,"My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck's book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck's book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease."
5,First book for newly-diagnosed celiacs!,"Jax updates her ""Against the Grain"" success story! It's the first resource to get when one is newly diagnosed with gluten intolerance or wheat sensitivity. Jax writes with intelligence, knowledge, sensitivity, creativity and wit about the gluten-free lifestyle. She tells it like it is; the gluten-free diet is very do-able, but attitude is everything. You'll enjoy learning with Jax as your guide in this GLUTEN-FREE BIBLE. [...]"
4,Did some of these reviewers even read this book?,"I find it strange that some of these negative or one star reviewers stated the supposed facts they understood from the book. Did they even read it or skim along, get into an angry frenzy and decide to write a review? Their reviews couldn't be more inaccurate. Over and over again, Jax lets you know that it's not okay to be subjected to just eating the topping of something without the crust or the insides of a sandwich. She writes to be prepared, but to also express your feelings when others expect you to be ok eating contaminated food, or eating around the dangerous parts of their dishes. Although I find some of her dialogue or self-back patting to rub against my grains, I still very much enjoyed her book and will not only suggest others should read it, but hold onto it for future reference. I guess read it and research anything you find questionable since it was published in 2005, things change, facts change. Otherwise, enjoy."
5,Anyone with Gluten issues should read this!,I have a family history of auto-immune disorders and have started developing them myself. This book was recommended by some other family members and I have read it and passed it on to more family who need it! Great book!
1,Poor Information for Celiacs,I found areas of this book that contained information that would make individuals needing to lead a gluten free life style ill. There were several poor suggestions in this book and also poor information regarding some of the products mentioned as NOT being gluten free that are!There are great books out there to help Celiacs! This is certainly *not* one of them.
1,Where's the storyline,"This is beautifully written but this does not make up for the total absence of a story. Three characters in war and how their lives, interact. Reads like a series of notes rather than a completed work. If it is trying to convey the horror of war it fails. Deeply deeply disappointing - I feel I have wasted my time and been cheated."
3,"An interesting novel, falls short","I had high expectations for this novel. In a way, this novel works from an implied starting point, where two protagonists intersect. The body of events are a long string of occurences, set in 3 sections, which trace the intricate multiplicities that inform the place and time for events. The event itself, 2 characters meeting, is uneventful and not significant. Could it be just another event setting the table for the future? The effect is to foreground the lineage that informs each moment in our lives. The flurry of events are barely noticable to the characters, as they are to our lives. I give it 3 stars as the author fails to offer any interpretation regarding the significance of the events."
3,Too Close to the Subject?,"In 1993-94, Ruhlman returned to his alma mater, University School in Cleveland, to explore the workings of an all-boys school and study its headmaster, the famously idiosyncratic Rick Hawley. In this context, I'd be hard-pressed to outline all my issues with Ruhlman's project, but his ""fly on the wall"" presentation of teachers and classes is consistently evocative--real, familiar, and true to the private school life I experience as a private school teacher. However, Ruhlman stumbles as he explains. When he tries to make something of his observations--to comment on what's distinctive about boys schools or what Rick Hawley represents or what anything adds-up to--he teeters on rationalization. If, as he says in the book, Ruhlman wanted his readers to ""fulfill"" the ""dramas"" he presented, he should have let them. Better yet, he might have left this task to someone who was not an alum of the school."
4,Compact Version of a Solid Translation,"If you are looking for a compact, pocket-sized copy of the New Testament, Psalms & Proverbs, this is a good one. The ESV is a respected, accurate translation. This copy is nicely bound and should last awhile with careful use. Of course, given the size, the text is on the small side. But that is the concession in the purchase of a pocket New Testament. Finally, the price is right."
3,ESV,"ESB New Testament with Psalms & ProverbsIt was smaller than I had hoped, which necessitated small type. Would like a larger one with attendent larger type."
5,Good for storage and for being less breakable than hard cases,"This item is good for storage of cds and is less breakable than the harder cases. Wish I'd have bought and may buy more of them than harder cases, which can crack."
5,Pictures and Words in Perfect Harmony,"Diane Schoemperlen said she found inspiration for this book when her young son asked her how come her books never have any pictures. She then had the brilliant idea to wrap short stories around antique drawings, 100 year old catalogue pictures and illustrations from the original Gray's Anatomy. The results are stories that are compelling on their own but are perfectly enhanced by the pictures put in them. A great gift or coffee table book to be flipped through again and again."
5,magic under a microscope,"After reading Schoemperlen's Language of Love I couldn't wait to read her new book. I was NOT disappointed. All of the magic and insight and wonder and irony is there. Later when I took a walk on the beach, everything seemed magnified. The sun and a grain of sand were suddenly about the same size and equally amazing."
5,She's lovely,"I found out about this author while reading a collection of shorts stories from 1998 with a forward from Garrison Keillor. Her short ""Body Language"" was included and it was the most impacting story of the bunch. This full collection does not disappoint!"
2,"missing pieces, no response from company","I needed this for a small repair job , but thought it would be useful to have around for years to come. I ended up returning it because parts were missing and the company never responded when i contacted them on their website.A note in the box requested that issues be resolved by contacting the company rather than returning the item, which I tried to follow, but when they don't respond to contact through their website, what is one to do but send the tool back?you can use this tool to repair your broken canondale road shifter bosses (on the downtube). just replace the easily broken bar with a slightly larger hole and a couple of m5 rivnuts and you're good to go. you can also easily install water bottle cages to any sheet of metal you can drill a pair of holes in."
1,Veclo stap to large,"I like everything about these shoes except the velco stap is enormous and overpowers the entire front of the shoe. My son looks like he is wearing orthopedic shoes, I had to return them he just looked way to goofy"
3,Nothing new,"Instructional design theory isn't new and this revision of the text doesn't change that. It is a good review but is not as current with new technology as I would have liked. The ADDIE model is a standard and while the text does explain the process, there is much more current information on the model and, in some cases, better explanation available on the internet."
3,Principles of Instructional Design,"The book arrived with no ordering/purchasing issues, and in the advertised time window. However, when it said it was used, I should have read the book condition closer. This was definitely a ""USED"" book. It was a college text and it was highlighted on nearly every page and the previous owner's notes were written throughout. This isn't necessarily negative feedback about the seller; this is a note to any used text purchaser...take close note of the listed condition and consider what you are receiving for your money. I don't feel this was a good value for what I spent.The text itself is a great foundational text for individuals starting to learn Instructional Design, or an excellent refresher text for the experienced Instructional Designer."
3,"A strong, spectacular sermon against the tragedy and wastefulness of war!","Two blockbuster films with a pacifist message were released in 1916, Thomas Ince's 'Civilization' and Herbert Brenon's 'War Brides.' Both were very popular and preached a strong anti-war message... They have often been cited as having helped to re-elect Woodrow Wilson on a peace platform...The hero of 'Civilization' is a submarine commander who refuses to torpedo a passenger vessel because he is secretly a devoted follower of the pacifist Mothers of Men Society... He is murdered by the mutinous crew and his soul is eventually redeemed by Christ... Jesus then assumes the dead man's form to plead the cause of peace before the king... He is successful and the king hastens to recall his soldiers..."
2,On second thought,"I left a review criticizing GrapeVine for not putting the fact that this is a DVD-R. On second thought and second viewing I believe that though the DVD-R format SHOULD be mentioned in the product description, this is probably the only way that rare films that can never hope to see commercial release can be made available. The print is not great, but I've seen worse and been able to enjoy the film. So sorry GrapeVine."
4,Fast-paced and Incredible action,"I read this series in junior high and loved it. Very original and very unique take on the secret agent genre. The main character is given the chance to be a top operative for a clandestine organization. Dying of cancer, he is given the opportunity to move his mind into cloned bodies. The only catch: the bodies break down after a period of time, giving him a very mortal deadline to his missions. I got into this series at the same time as the Destroyer and Mack Bolan books. This was by far my favorite. I highly recommend this to fans of extraordinary adventure."
1,Where's the instructions,"Was a little tricky without instructions but I figured it out....however, will not work on the bike as the brackets are too thick to slide over the wheel bolts and leave enough room for the frame to be reattached. Returning it"
5,Sharing Pain...,"I just bought my second copy of this CD - I have loaned my first to so many friends, one finally kept it! When I first heard the CD, I wondered if something had gone wrong with Amy Grant's long-time marriage to Gary Chapman. A long-term relationship of my own had just ended badly, and the songs I was hearing, particularly ""Like I Love You"", ""Cry a River"", ""Missing You"", ""The Feeling I Had"" and ""Somewhere Down the Road"", echoed my very feelings of regret, loss, hope and emptiness. Later, I heard that Grant's marriage had ended. I had never heard a collection that so profoundly captured those feelings, as if the person on the CD was in my shoes. She writes and performs each song from her own torn heart and in words she has cried. It is the rawness and honesty which brings me back again and again and keeps me recommending it to my friends."
5,I love this CD,"Leave it all Behind, I Will be Your Friend, Like I Love You, Takes a Little Time, Turn this World Around.. OMG, pretty much all are my favorites!! Gotta have it!"
3,Nice Change for Amy.,"Amy Grant departs from some of her earlier work in the happy upbeat pop albums and releases a more acoustic kind of pop rock. It also leaves behind a lot of the happier themes from previous albums. She deals with a lot of different emotions and struggles on this album. It has very well written material and Amy still has the great voice to sing. Standout songs for me are ""Takes a Little Time"" and ""Somewhere Down the Road."" It also may take a few listens before the CD grows on you as it is a departure for her."
4,"Something familiar, something different","Iv'e been listening to Amy's music since I was 16 years - I find in her a kindred spririt. While the tones of the album weren't overtly spiritual, you can find the christian influence. My favorite song on the album was Somewhere Down the Road which addresses the questions we all have about life's tragedies. Like others before me, I could have done without Nobody Home - it just did'nt seem to fit. I've always believed that Amy Grant sings from her heart and this album does not refute it. This isn't my favorite album of hers, but my opinion of it improves each time I listen to it."
5,Amy's Best!,"Amy Grant's albums are like a soundtrack to all of our lives. Out of all of her albums, ""Behind The Eyes"" is definitely the album that shows us the real Amy Grant, of who she is as a person, not a personality. Personally, I thought this was going to be another ""Heart In Motion"" (which I still love), but boywas I wrong. I remember when Iheard her doing her version ofJoni Mitchell's ""Big YellowTaxi"" (from ""House Of Love""), I kind of guessed that will bewhat this album would sound like: Very earthy, acoustic, and organic. ""Lead Me On"" was just like that too when it came out in 1988. I love ""Takes A Little Time."" It has a Tom Petty-like sound that you would never her on an Amyrecord. I like all the songs,especially ""Somewhere Down The Road,"" ""Missing You,"" and ""I Will Be Your Friend."" This album will stand the test of time."
5,The REAL Amy Grant has come forward,"Truthful. Dark. Uplifting. - call it what ya like but this isindefinitely her most personal and emotional powerful record to date. Behind the eyes captures sheer honesty from within Amy Grant and the best part is, it's very relatable. From Like i love you, to the ""Feeling I had"" and then "" I will be your friend"" it's apparent that Amy has come through many changes. But what is Strikingly interesting is how she toned down the ""fluffy pop"" sound and got accoustic. She's showing the listener that this record isn't about sappy love songs, it's about life and making peace in her life. I think we all need some peace in our lives every now and then..don't ya think?"
3,"Thoughtful, but melodically not as interesting","This was a welcome break from the sugar-pop of ""Heart in Motion"" and ""House Of Love"", but those CD's had a couple of standout songs (""Baby Baby"", ""Good For Me"", ""House of Love"", ""Helping Hand""). I appreciate the thoughtfulness on this CD, but I don't find myself listening to it repeatedly. The melodies in particular seem rather derivative. The lyrics are introspective, but don't touch me in the way the lyrics from ""Age to Age"" or ""Lead Me On"" did. Amy always puts out good albums, and this is a good album, much better than most of what's out there, but still not the best work she's done."
2,Not SYNC with the spirit of Amy Grant,"All the songs give you that ""uh, yep,,,right,,,ok"". If ya face facts,,,,Amy is due out for a ""Best of"" to make up for the really BAD songs lately she has produced that were not hits. Remember Journey's off songs,,,,,simuliar here with Amy Grants,,,,,,I have owned her entire collection to date and ""Heart of Motion"" CD is SO vastly superior to the rest of her CD's. I have loved the ""Angels"" song on the ""Straight Ahead"" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"
1,NOT GOOD,"Who does she think she is? Amy Grant has been singing for years and years and still no one sees what she's doing? First she gets everyone thinking she's a Christian singer so she doesn't get as much opposition and more positive attention. Then she gets secular and fools those who are too blind to see. If you think ANY of her music will draw you closer to God it won't, and NO MATTER WHAT don't get this CD!"
5,tremendous skin flick - one worth owning,"No plot, very little talking, tons of high-quality flesh - all you could hope for from this genre in one package"
1,Beware: this is a bootlegged/pirated video,"If you paid for this product, you overpaid. Granted, the original, out-of-print dvd of The Bikini Carwash Company sells for exorbitant prices, so my suggestion is to just download it for free through torrents and cut the video pirates and video scalpers down to size. If anything, buy the European PAL version, which is also uncut and uncensored, and available on the North American Amazon as well."
4,Enjoyable,Girls are cute and really attractive. Most enjoyable little film especialy if you like bikini tops falling off and boobs exposed.
1,don't even bother,"this is by far one of the worst step 2 prep materials ever! the questions on this CD ROM were random, poorly written, and testing very obscure material, certainly material inappropriate for the step 2 level. as an example, drug X effects which part of the electron transport chain? oh my, that's going way back into first year med, which in not what step 2 is about. we all know step 2 is for clinical applications of what we've learned as third year meds, and i can honestly say that this CD does not test these types of things. it was extremely frustrating trying to go thru the CD and ""give it a chance"" but i just couldn't take it anymore! try the NMS series or the A&L ERT if you want some computer practice, this exam master stuff doesn't cut it."
1,Exam Master. for the USMLE Step 2,"I hate this CD , it was waste of money and I wish I could refund my money ( 89 USD + S&H, I bough it directly from the publisher) I am absolutly agree with the rest of the reviewers. questions are not even close to USMLE step 2 format. whoever wrote those questions I am sure that had no idea about USMLE at all since the questions are about any thing but USMLE step 2. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME ON THIS CD 7 insted try to read NMS REVIEW multiple Q ( it is bible of USMLE step 2 )."
5,Out of the Garden of Eden . . .,"To many people Mr. Young's thesis will seem to be outlandish. Yet, he is the one author I know of who actually tries to seek out the origins of religion using modern research into chimpanzee behavior. I wonder what Jane Goodall thinks of it? First there was Freud's Totem and Taboo, a mere root to Young's amazing tree. As he writes, "" . . . the Darwinian-Freudian-Foxian root-stock on to which I would graft the story of alpha-shaman."" I'm not sure exactly how to take him, but it is dazzling stuff. Since there was no impartial observer in the Garden of Eden, perhaps he is correct."
5,Dell E207WFP Monitor,"This monitor, when it first came out, received rave reviews and I have not been disappointed. Since first buying it a few years ago, I have since added two additional ones as well. I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for a older model that performs well."
1,"save your money, dont let the price fool you","second hand quality. i have ordered this before from sleep warehouse. now their memory foam seems to be second hand quality. i recommend trying another site that has true grade quality. don't let the low price fool you, like i did. when i press my hand in the foam, it comes back to shape in 2 seconds. the foam i got 2 years ago, same brand, it would take 5 seconds to come back to shape. that was great foam. try someone else"
3,great rock vocals,I enjoy listening to little richard sing old rock songs. He's got a great rock vocal sound .
1,Devoid of depth or even much substance,"The only type of person to whom I could possibly recommend this book is someone with no experience with children and who wants a ""forest"" level view of them from one source. There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight."
5,Your Child,"Your Child is one of the best books I have ever picked up to read! My toddler and I were experiencing some difficulties at home, which is why I purchased the book. After reading this wonderful map through childhood, I believe we are both going to be just fine. It gives hope to parents that we really are doing a good job at raising our kids in todays world. And if we aren't, it gives great advise on how to seek help. This isn't your typical ""self-help"" book!"
2,Try something else.,"I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters."
2,Hard Times,"I picked up Hard Times preparing to enjoy it since Charles Dickens is my favorite author. While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor."
2,A Horrible Mess of Incoherent Words,"This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly. I personally dislike Dicken's wordy style of writing because it's easy to get lost. If you like Dickens, and you don't mind his writing style I'm sure you would probably disagree with me. I'll give it a two."
2,Death by verbosity,Charles Dickens did for the art of literature what the 80's did for music: Made it intolerable and robbed it of any beauty. The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote. His knack for wrapping up loose ends in a nice neat conclusion is overshadowed by the time and effort it takes to reach that point
4,Dickens Had a Hard Time Writing This,"Readers should always remember that while reading. Instead of the usual monthly periodical installments with room to spare, ""Hard Times"" was done in weekly installments with a very limited space allotment, for the newspaper ""Household Words."" Dickens found the combined pressure of time and space nearly intolerable, given the breadth and depth of his vision for needed social reform. One can only imagine how much better, fuller, and more satisfying this book would have been -- in plot, character-development, dramatic impact -- if Dickens had written it as 900 pages over two years, rather than 300 pages in five months."
3,Not Dickens' best book,"Hard Times feels like a book that Dickens did not polish nearly as much as the many classics associated with his name. It's the story of the unhappy lives of two children of a father who raised them to speak and appreciate only ""facts."" Imagination, fantasy, passion, and the like were all forbidden in their household.Their lives are unhappy, as you'd expect. But they also lack much narrative interest. The usual twists and turns of fate that Dickens invests into his characters' lives are mostly absent. As a result the book drags on. Hard Times also lacks the humor found in other Dickens books, his pithy observations of different persona of his time. So, in reading the uninspiring narrative, you find yourself wishing for something, anything of the old Dickensian magic. Alas, it does not show up.If you have other Dickens titles you're set on reading, read them first. You're likely to enjoy them more."
3,Hard Times,"I needed this book for a college class. It was shipped quickly and was in great shape when I got it. Also, it was very affordable, much cheaper than other carriers. However, I would not recommend this book for pleasure reading. I personally did not enjoy this Dickens tale."
3,So-so,"I totally didn't get this book. Ordinarily I like Dickens but now I simply couldn't figure out what each event had to do with each other, nor did I understand the end. However the single segments, especially those with Louisa in them, were interesting. It is even funny reading the beginning of the book when Mr. Gradgrind teaches that imagination is useless and only facts are important. If you want a fluid book that is more this type of story,read Great Expectations,which is not my favorite book but it certainly makes more sense. Personally, my favorite Dickens is Oliver Twist."
4,A Quite Good Book,"A most interesting book, and not the ""downer"" one might expect from the title. The story begins with the issue of what might happen to children raised in a setting where the non-logical human qualities are repressed. This is blended in with the relationship dynamics of those who own the factories and those who make the factories actually produce something to sell. Further, related issues are added. These various topics are intermingled in a moving story."
5,Hard Times,Book was in excellent condition and service was excellent. It's not the seller's fault that the book is boring.
3,"Good, but not up to Dickens standerds","Charles Dickens was the greatest writer of all time, unfortuntly you can't tell that from Hard Times. Not that its a bad book, for your average writer its pretty good, but I agree that it doesn't have his usual humour and that its kind of flat. Its also kind of a one subject book too, you know, it mainly deals with parents who put down their kids imaginations. I did like it though, it just wasn't as memorable."
2,Underwhelmed,"This is not Dickens at his best. No offence to the narrator, who does a good job but I think the story itself is rather boring. Especially when compared with his classics ""Great Expectations"", ""A Christms Carol"" and ""A Tale of Two Cities""."
4,"A good, clean book","For my English class, I read Charles Dickens' ""Hard Times."" I chose this book because I have read several of Dickens' works, and I have enjoyed them. I find his works good, thought-provoking books that are free of cuss words, violence, and lusts. I think this book was a realistic account of what life was like in the early nineteen hundreds. I was glad that Mr. Gragrind came around in his thinking and realized it is okay to have fun. I am also glad of how the book ended. I was glad to see that justice was preserved. Overall, I think this is a good book, and I would suggest that you read it. I enjoyed it."
3,Not Dickens' best.,"Still not a bad story, but rather more depressing than most of his books, there is very little to make this an enjoyable read, as Dickens usually is. Also, there is very little subtlety here; Dickens has a point (facts are not everything; there is more to life than practicality) and he hammers that point home repeatedly, making little effort to allow the reader to feel clever for having discerned the author's point. Most of the characters are caricatures, with the possible exception of Louisa; this is a flaw not unusual in Dickens' writing, but it seems more noticable and blatant here than in some of his better stories.Worth reading, but not excellent."
3,DVD Copy of Old (But Good) Film,"The title says it all. It is OK, but there are better products, like Weapons of the Card Shark by Jeff Wessmiller.The problem with all of these DVDs is that they are essentially teaching how to perform the false shuffles and cuts, but don't address the best ways to detect the moves."
1,Less than one star.,"Didn't like this book at all. For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!! Unbelievable! 2. the heroine was way too dependent upon daddy; did she not have any type of backbone? 3. The biggest, Ben knew the truth and yet he had to create all this angst on both their parts!!! YUCK!!"
3,Not bad...,"the game itself was a very enjoyable experience, just the fact that by the time I was done playing the game, I had blisters the size of pancakes on my thumb. The reason for this is because the game's character movement is done with the D-pad rather than the analog sticks, and since the combos are mostly divised of sliding your thumb all over the pad, it WILL hurt after awhile. but overall, a good game."
3,King of Fighters 2006,"This is a good fighting game with excellent graphics. Nice stories, and some good extras. It has a lot of different characters. However, this game very much has a 3D feel, instead of a 2D one, so if you are someone who has mastered certain combos with certain characters in the King of Fighters series, you will find that the mechanics don't work the same in this game. It is still a good game, though, and it certainly advances the story for a number of characters."
2,more of the same,"It's *another* King of Fighters game. Don't we already have enough of these already? It's not like this one is drastically different from the other ones.It's basically the same game as all the other King of Fighters but with a 2006 date attached to the title name, which means people will notice it, realize it's brand new, and buy it immediately. Why do we continue to be tormented like this? In a world already loaded with more than enough tournament fighters, I have just this to say- FIND SOMETHING ELSE."
3,...,While fun at times the game feels unpolished. Some characters were clearly meant to be over powered (Alba.) It's very interesting to see how the characters work in a 3D environment.
4,Alittle More Of This and Alittle less of That,"Bad Azz is dope and getting better everytime i hear him, however in my opinion its his beats and track selection that will halt his progress in terms of album sales and flava. His first album was good but suffered the same as this album in the fact that there are too many tracks that sound the same because they are so laid back and really lacking alittle liveness or crunkness even though this maybe the style of beat Bad Azz chose because he describes ghetto struggle so well. The best tracks are 'Streetz Illustrated', 'Wrong Idea' and 'How We Do It' with afew others close behind. If Bad Azz can include afew more tracks like these on his albums then he will start to really shine. Buy this album still, because the good tracks are Phat!!!"
1,I dont feel it,"Im not feelin this album. I always liked Bad Azz along with all the other LBC and DPG rappers,,, I thought his ""word on the streetz"" album was good,,,, but I just dont feel this album. In my opinion the best song is ""wrong idea"" which as you know is also on the last meal album from snoop dogg, and it isnt a real great track..... so that doesnt say a lot for this album"
4,bed pad,I have actually had this item for awhile! I wanted to purchase a large thickness but this has actually been great! At least until I can afford my dream bed.
4,The moves of the Butterfly Swords come to life on video....,"The moves illustrated in this book by William Cheung are performed by him on video in ""Wing Chun Kung Fu, volume 4.""available on DVD, ASIN: B0001FFJR8Wing Chun Kung Fu, Vol 4 by William M. Cheung, or on VHS, ASIN: B00000JRU7.Wing Chun Kung Fu Vol.04"
1,Save your money,"This is a 6 x 4.5 x 0.5 inch book that is basically the federal rules with SOME objections. So far the description doesnt sound so bad right? But then throw in that this tiny little booklet is $35.00 bucks. If you buy this, and some of you will, you will be shocked at how tiny this book is with large print running you 35 bucks. I got a required book on the federal rules and a book on objections that total $70.00 and both on their own are worth more than this. Get something else if you can. The books I purchased instead of this are below.[...]"
3,Russian Work,"This is a work which I will read for my UCLA class later. So, for now, I have no opinion."
3,PET,"This arrived quickly, but within the space of an hour, my son was having difficulties with it. We contacted the manufacturer and they gave us some instructions which did not work. We were instructed to send back to the manufacturer, who issued a replacement. This one does work and my son is pleased. Not really sure how much he will play with it though. One thing that you are not made aware of, is that you should not play with it for more than 3 hours at a time, because the toy cannot be used more frequently than that. It does not work continously for 3 hours either, very hit or miss."
4,Possibilities in the Future,"Although the PET's are an interesting concept, perhaps you (the customer) should wait until something more hi-tech such as one with a laser pointer acsess and the Net Nabby actually communicates with you. There would also de much better graphics. This computing power isn't feesable now, but if you wait it'll be worth it."
4,execellent toy,"this is good toy. it's cool that you can now put chips in a PET, unlike the gameboy advance. it's educational because it teaches tatics in you useing things for advantages. it does'nt scratch easily and the power would be be somewhat better lasting than double a's.it's also very fun and it's not just for 2 players,there's one player mode (i think). booster packs will come out soon. it's great fun to play"
4,cool!!!!!!!!,the pet is preety cool its a nice sise and also if u want great game exp. buy more battlechips i cant give this toy 5 stars becuse when u die u need to shake it which is retadrded when i bought it at first i thought it would be a load of crap now i know that and if u buy it i want u to know
3,Megaman P.E.T is NOT good,"The Megaman P.E.T is NOT good. All it has is black and white plus you can only use 1 chip at a time. No program advance. No NOTHING. Do NOT buy this toy. It doesn't even have a clip for you to hang onto your belt or somewhere. And you can't chase the virus around with the box to hit it and the virus might just stand in 1 spot waiting for the time to be gone. Also, the virus has a 92% chance of hitting you while you only have 57% of hitting it. Oh well. Too bad. Bad toy."
1,don't buy,"I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games. He played it the 1st day he got it, but it was difficult, involved alot of shaking. I also had to take it apart because he pressed the reset button & it stopped working at all. We put it away for awhile & the next time he tried to use it, no battles, no matter how much we shake, it is useless now. How can they make such junk?"
3,it rocks,this is the coolest thing ever! the screen is sometimes bad but overall you will need to buy more battlechips for better replay value. And they have this shake thing that is retarded. when you end this or turn it off and then turn it on you need to shake it to do single player mode so i recomend that you take a walk with this for the shaking thing. overall three out of five
1,Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game,"I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other."
5,To Jake Song,"Jake Song ""Jake"" (New Jersey USA) this is for you remember when you said ask you if anyone wants to know the glich to get any battle chip you want. [...]"
4,Suspense thrillers are my fave!,Stumbled on this one while channel surfing on cable... It has already started some time ago. So I went on Amazon and bought the soft copy so I can watch it immediately.
4,Kovax box,"Good mystery, some good twists! From the beginning to the end it keeps you guessing!Also enjoy the leading man when he was a younger man!"
2,Hutton's lost cause,"Oscar winner Timothy Hutton stars in this spanish made film.He plays Science Fiction Author David Norton. He is invited to an island conference. He takes his girl friend, asks her to marry himA DVD appears in his room and she commits suicide..and then more people start dying. He is usually in control, suddenly life takes a nasty spin.Hutton takes the lead with this weak script. The plot wears thin after the first 30 minutes and then it starts to drag. There is no sub plots. The suspense of this film feels disjointed and starts to bore. There are no thrills to capture an audience. Towards the end, Hutton looks bored as lead and the film falls apartTry to miss this one in your video store, until all the other good films are rentedBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,I expected more.....,"The 2 stars goes to Timothy Hutton for his great performance, truly an outstanding actor! But... the movie... well not so great. I was left somewhat disappointed. It starts well and gives you the impression of a good movie but then it evolves into a bizarre scenario that completely fails to keep up the suspenseful tone of the start, and is in fact rather wearisome and inconclusive at times. It's as if they are trying really hard to achieve a goal with a poor script... I expected more that's all..."
1,WHAT A WASTE!! DON'T BUY!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,THIS WASTE OF TIME COST ME TWENTY BUCKS FOR A VIDEO THAT WAS NOT EVEN THIRTY MINUTES!! YOU CAN NOT EXPLORE ANYTHING IN THAT SHORT OF TIME!!!! YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ON YOUTUBE FOR FREE!!! DON'T FALL FOR THE SAME TRICK I DID! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!
4,Good for the price,I just got this player and found it very easy to use (without even referring to the handbook). It's great being able to play one CD full of about 14 albums in MP3 format. I've not tried other formats yet. The design is very nice and has all the main basic functions. It does seem to last a long time on 2 AA batteries (longer than an ipod ;-)The sound is OK for the price but I found that it does skip a bit after some time if on the move (unless you hold it carefully). For my use though (listening whilst travelling on the bus and train) I find it just right and the added FM radio is excellent for listening to BBC World service.I've just sent off for another one for my daughter who is 9 years old and loves the look of it.
1,"difficult to program, no access to manual","Sp65 is difficult to program. Detailed instructions are not included with purchased item, and send you to a web page that is unavailable (www.sonicblue.com/support). I think this is a piece of junk!"
4,What I needed,Tonneau covers aren't cheap and this is what I needed to help salvage mine. Only bad thing was it still wasn't enough even for a regular six foot bed.
3,Great for romantic dinner with hubby!,"I love great songs turned into classic music. it is wonderful to be able to play some of my favorite songs, during a romantic dinner. It would have been great at my wedding to play during dinner :DJess"
4,A Little-Known Disaster,"In October of 1871, something like 2,500 people were cremated alive in the forest fire that forever changed Wisconsin from the Big Woods to America's Dairyland. Eclipsed by the simultaneous Great Chicago Fire, and because few eyewitnesses actually survived to tell about it, the Peshtigo firestorm never achieved the notoriety it should have and there are not many books about it. This one builds a suspenseful narrative out of the more reliable accounts and anecdotes of the fire, and is studded with unforgettable images -- the self-herding house cats, the pretty girl running down the flaming boardwalk, the farmer who momentarily left his wife and children alone in the wagon ...The shipwreck story is a bonus."
3,Stoner Metal,"This is Varg's attempt at making Stoner Metal a la Six Feet Under or Cannibal Corpse. Here he seems content with the overall sound of the music, incorporating keyboards more fully into the black metal sound. Largely regarded as a defining point of the black metal genre, it is here where you get involved with Burzum as a political experiment. I'm one of the only Einstize Commandos left from its 90s notoriety. Sales began picking up in the millenium."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!!,i ordered this item for support being that i have a rather large chest. the item had MUCH more coverage than the picture lets on and came in the size i ordered according to the tag but once i had it on i realised it was 3 sizes too SMALL. when i returned it to the sender the refunded only HALF my money. this item was ordered with one more bra like it and out of my $40 order i got just over $20 back. i plan on disputing this with amazon and the seller.
3,Keep Looking Girls! Old fashion bra.,I purchased 2 of this style of bra looking for a comfortable alternative to underwires. I was shocked how stiff and ichty the fabric was. I purchased my regular size 40H and it was way too tight. I would order a cup size up. I did not return this bra because I got it for such a good price $14.35. I think I got what I paid for. I won't be by this model again.
2,"Nice bra, but sizes run LARGE","I love the style of the bra, however I ordered a 46D in Black and the cup size of what I received was almost double in size. The label read 46D (which I know I wear), but had to send it back because the cup was just too LARGE."
5,pretty outfit,this item was fantastic and neat. it arrived on time.it was worth the money. I will buy more items like this again.
5,cooker,This is a book I had when I was in the first grade. I recently started cooking with my eight year old and hoped this book was still out there. I have never seen it it a bookstore and there it was on Amazon and for less than three dollars!! It was exactly the way I remembered it. We have already made several of the things in the book. We have a lot of fun looking at the pictures and following the directions and the together time is great! A classic forever!
2,"""March of the Saint"" is the one to find...","I remember Armored Saint from their tour opening for WASP and Metallica. L'Amour in Brooklyn. These guys ROCKED. Unfortunately this album, lacking second guitarist Phil Sandoval, does not rock. Poor production values, even explained on the liner, makes it even less acceptable. I gave it the second star only because it was great to hear ""Can U Deliver?"" again and I can't find the now out of print ""March of the Saint"" first album. Buy it if you're a die-hard Saint fan like myself, but if you're looking for a good Saint album currently available get ""Symbol Of Salvation"" instead. It's pretty rockin'."
5,"Regina Carter., Motor City Moments, I'll Be Seeing You, Paganini After A Dream.","I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again."
2,violin w/a kick,"Maybe I shouldn't review this album since I'm not very familiar w/jazz or jazzy styles so what I have to say is coming from a more or less mainstream perspective regarding this genre. With that said, I'm also a sucker for live shows so I'll have to second the reviews that maintain Regina Carter is best experienced live, a fact which prompted me to buy this album after seeing a performance in '01. With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry ""Forever February"" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's ""Don't Mess With Mr. T"" is also interesting. Besides that, I should mention that Carter is an enchanting violinist. Go see her live performances."
5,excellent praise and worship CD,"I really enjoyed this album, especially the songs ""I can't live without you"", ""King of Glory"", ""More of You"", and ""One God"". There were a few songs that would be good for choirs or dance ministries. I'll play this one for a while."
5,un livre pour comprendre la vie / a guide for life,"En résumé, si vous tes dans une période de votre vie où tout semble arriver sans raison et but précis...ce livre pourrais bien vous redonnez de l'espoir et vous aider à comprendre ''le pourquoi'' de la vie.In resumé, if your stuck in a rut, and you feel like nothing is going like you planned out in life; that your wondering why ''this or that'' is happenning....this book will give you hope by allowing you to understand ''the why'' of life."
4,Alchemist book,Great book ... my friend will really like this book especially since it is in French. Hope to order more books soon from this retailer
4,Aids in hands-free phone usage,"I use this phone holder every day on my commute, in conjunction with an auto charger and hands-free earset. I find it indispensable in securely fastening the phone in place, yet easily removable. It makes one-hand dialing easy, and I don't have to worry about the phone sliding around because of sudden turns or stops. One word of note: it doesn't accept the use of oversize extended-life batteries."
3,Strange and complex,"After reading other reviews of Anno Dracula I couldn't wait to read it, but afterwards wasn't quite sure what the fuss was all about. At times it seemed that the author was trying to pull in every character (real and fictional) of the period that they possibly could, which made the book very difficult to follow and distracted from the development of the main characters. The book is quite descriptive of gory and almost gratuitous violence. Definitely not a book that I would read again, and I have no interest in the sequels."
3,Victorian Vampires,"It wasn't a bad read...a little weird sometimes, but it was a book about vampires so it needed to be weird. Having Queen Victoria as the suicidal consort of Count Dracula was a little much, but the imagery was good and the detail was well written. All in all, if you are a vampire fan, go for it!"
5,Wonderful!,"Consider what might have happened to England if Dracula had survived Stoker's novel. This is the premise upon which Newman's story is built. Fortunately, his knowledge of Victorian history and literature is matched only by his brilliant ability as a storyteller. Newman is one of the best!"
1,I did not like it. Messy,"I did not really care for this book. I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net. I wanted to like it (I very much enjoyed Alan Moore's tales of the Extraordinary Gentlemen's League)... A very intriguing idea though (I give the acorn a golden prize but the oak grew sickly)... Maybe it is your thing; it was not mine."
2,Uninspired,"Gee, I wasn't as impressed as you guys. I found it quite tedious. Bram Stoker's original is one of a kind. This is not even remotely in the same league. Sorry."
2,DRACULA SUCKS,Too many characters that appear for a sentence or two and then just vanish into the London fog of the late 19th century.
2,"Come Watson, the games afoot!","Unfortunately, it's two left feet on this occasion. I bought the book as I am a big fan of both Holmes and Dracula stories, but despite the sometimes colorful characters, it was a tedious read."
2,Waaaaay too much in this book for a mere 350 pages,"This book needed to be, in my opinion, at least two hundred pages longer to fully explore all the ideas that were brought up. I liked how it was written and all the cameos by other famous vampires/historical figures, but what I didn't like was the ending. The killer I thought was a real let down, as was how he was eventually caught. And the way Dracula was presented at the very end....ugh. Not good at all.I guess if you're really bored and desperately want to read a vampire novel, this will do. Otherwise, steer clear of this book."
3,Not as good as expected,"Purchased it because Amazon suggested it. Yes, a Jack-the-Ripper vampire tale is a new spin on vampire stories. No, I didn't much enjoy it: kind of slow, not as gripping as Anne Rice."
4,The Ending worth its Weight in Gold,"Many of these reviews have already laid out the story's premise and characters. I feel it my duty to comment on the last 20 pages, which are as deeply haunting as they are unforgettable. In those pages, the detective protagonist finally confronts the Prince of Vampires, and Kim Newman shows he is a true wizard of imagery. Dracula's court is a mixture of Bram Stoker's vision and an Hieronymous Bosch painting, and leaves an undelible mark on the reader."
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","Too much filler. None of the characters was unique, and much of the book was full of boring conversations that went on and on about trite details. Dull book. Skipped large parts of it."
1,"Too many names, too little interest.","This book needs a grammar check. It is incomprehensible. I am trying to return it. It sucks, to coin a pun."
4,Quarter of the stake through the heart...,"I'm a quarter of the way through this and my interest has peaked and troughed.Peaks:- The array of real and fictional characters and their often amusing relationships with each other- The entire premise - a very refreshing vampire faceliftTroughs:- Parts are quite polarised - particularly those concerning Genevieve- Bit confusing keeping up at one part with several characters having similar names (but maybe that's just me!)It dipped a bit for me and I thought I might end up driving a silver knife through it, but I stuck with it and now I look forward to times when I can sit down and read it.Kim Newman's concept is brilliant."
3,Somewhere between 3 1/2 stars & 4,"I saw this book on a recent list naming the best vampire novels of the last century. Having read most of the others I found myself compelled to read it.Anno Dracula is a very rich & character filled novel. Set in 1888 England, the story is what happens Dracula hadn't been killed by van helsing & his friend's but rather survived & went on to marry queen Victoria. Now vampirism runs rampat & Dracula is the prince consort. Add to this the whitechapel murders, jack the ripper & so many extra characters (fictional & non-fictional) & you have anno Dracula.I really enjoyed the book however it was occasionally over laden with so many characters. I was lucky that my newer addiction had an index that defined all the people, characters & names the author was referencing.I would have liked to have seen Dracula & queen Victoria more, that being said the ending is powerful with their presence.I recommend this book especially if you like alternate history."
5,As advertised,"The seller presented the title accurately and honestly. The book arrived in a timely manner, in tact."
3,Nothing new if you know anything already...,"After all the hype about this book and the foreword and endorsement from Massad Ayoob, I really thought this book would teach me something new. It didn't. I expected a nice primer on tactics and exercises, instead I got a bunch of rudimentary safety lecturing and rehash of obvious and well-known ideas and rules for handling a firearm. If you have NEVER owned a firearm before, this book may teach you something. If you do own a firearm and have any proficiency with it - that is, you take it out of the drawer from time to time to practice at the range - then don't waste your money on this very basic and boring book. This book has nothing to do with helping you move towards the decision to go CCW or really even how to defend your own home, except for one short chapter - and all of it is all common sense stuff anyway. An average book with nothing new."
4,Overall good book.,"This was the first book that I purchased after becoming a CHL instructor. I was impressed with a lot of the information within the book. However, there were quite a few typos which, to some, could lead to a credibility issue of the author and information when dealing with such a high stakes issue."
4,"Good info, poor construction","I was a little disappointed with this book. Not with the information, which I found to be very interesting, but the construction of the book itself is bad. Page 12 is printed in place of page 22 which is included as an afterthought on a single sided page just stuck between the pages like a book mark! I have great respect for Massad Ayoob who wrote the foreward and for the author, David Kenik. However I have little respect for a publisher who obviously did not read the pre-press proof. Again, good information, poor construction."
3,Good for the Novice or for a Review,"I find I agree with reviewer Sarafin. This book has many production errors that should have been caught at the publisher. Apparently mine is from the same print run as it has the identical errors. Nothing terribly new here, but it's a good basic overview of things to know when you're considering carrying."
3,well.....,The Metal Massacre series is awesome but this one is one of the low points.Witchslayer and Lizzy Borden are the only bands worth hearing on this album...
4,Scott's fudge balls,"These were delicious, but not wrapped as well as I think they should be. They kind of melted out of their wrapping."
5,Crucial Confrontations,Excellent book. Easy directions and explanations to implement the Crucial Confrontation Model.
2,Wasn't Impressed,"Lots of diagrams and drawings, pointing arrows, etc. I felt as though I were back in class and was missing the required supplementary workbook.This book seems to address mainly work situations where the reader is the boss and having difficulty with a recalcitrant employee. There just wasn't much for me here to apply to my own life."
5,Best Business Tool Ever!,"Knowing I had to face a crucial confrontation I looked for answers to help me in this uncomfortable situation; and, I found them!! Not only is the information valuable in business but it applies to family and life in general. Recommend it to anyone that has a hard time facing confrontations. It is written in a way that is both easy to understand and to apply. The information flows in a format that makes total sense."
5,Great for individuals or companies,"The follow up to ""Crucial Conversations"" this book has some great tools and insight into dealing with those crucial confrontations that we all have from time to time."
3,Crucial Confrontations,"I found the book very limited because of the kinds of confrontations presented. For the narrow focus, the information was good, although not as concise as I would have liked. There are so many other confrontations which were not addressed. How does one answer an employee who always wants a bigger raise or more time off? How does one handle an employee who is never satisfied with the work environment? I would like to have learned more about a variety of crucial confrontations and in a more concise format.Crucial Confrontations: Tools for Resolving broken promises, violated expectations, and bad behavior"
4,Very Useful,This is a workbook for people in organizations or any relationship to have a succesesful confrontation. I think the ideas are very good. It follows some of the basic tenets of Conflict Resolution.
2,Old information,"Unfortunately, I did not like this book. I found it difficult to read and boring, even though it was recommended by a friend.."
5,Best on this topic!,This is the most practical and best researched book on conflict resolution. On my top 10 best management/leadership books. Must read!
4,Why I like the EG-D2 Audio Video Cable,I do say it is a varry handy item for PC Cameras so that you can plug it into theVCR to make a Copy of what Video you Recorded on your Camera and put ona VHS Tape or a DVD CD if you have a DVD Player that can Burn DVD's
3,"picture fine, sound not so much","I got this in the mail yesterday. Wasn't sure if it was used or brand new after opening the package. I think used or refurbished because the packaging wasn't as securely closed as i would have liked. Not sure if there should have been paperwork within the packaging but there wasnt any. But then again, i wouldn't know. It looked like it came in an authentic Nikon box with the Nikon logo so i would assume its actually by nikon and not a knock off but you never know nowadays. ANYWAY, my issue is when I attached the camera to a monitor, depending on how i moved the cord i would get an occasional static sound. ANNOYING! I just don't expect that from nikon that's why I'm not sure if it is brand new. I can always disconnect the white sound cord. I intend to record sound separately anyway, BUT I shouldn't have to worry about a static noise interfering in my footage."
2,"Great Record, Bad Remaster","I love this record. And I am also a big fan of remastered re-releases (Bowie, Roxie, etc.), but I was disappointed in the sound of this remaster. My Import version sounds MUCH better...a lot more raw, more vital, better definition between instruments. This sounds like a lot of compression, and not much more. Buy this record, but don't re-buy it for a better experience like I did."
5,WOW!!!! Great reference book!,I bought this as an inspiration for my wife who makes boxes. We both love the book and have come away with some great ideas!
2,An adventure story that fails,"This book by Tom Bodett was long and it took awhile to get to the action. It dragged on and on while it was about page 160 when the short action part started. Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos. The raidos are the kid's only source of communtian, and their only way to interact with the outside world.While then they have to make many trips back and fourth to the outer world, it takes much time to get to the interesting parts.Overall, this book had some good parts to it, but wasn't the best book I have ever read."
3,Ryan,"Ivan and September are two kids who live with their dad in a small town in Alaska. Since they live in a remote area they must be very careful with their choices they make. When their father goes out on a long fishing trip the children stay at home alone. On one of the days they are alone Ivan's video game batteries go out so he hooks up the radio battery to it, even though he is not supposed to since that is their only way of communicating with the outside world. When he does this the radio breaks and they go out to get a new radio. The only way Ivan and September can go anywhere is on a boat but they are not supposed to and dig up clams to earnm money to get a new radio. On one of the clam digging days there is a large storm but since they do not have a radio the do not know the weather so they get in the middle of a very large storm."
4,Good book for young teens,"Ok, the kids accused me of reading it because its full of boats, dories, fishing boats, rowboats, skiffs, mailboats etc and they are right. But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids."
3,good book,i think that this book was a good book because it told alot of detail about the story and about the characters and the way they felt about what was going on. the author told you everything that you needed to know and even the things that weren't that important.
4,"It worked, when I used it years ago.","This worked great when I used it. It's been so long, but I remember it worked great! The only problem is that comparing it to anything recent or current technology its a piece of junk."
1,This item is a total scam,"This ""book"" is only a pamphlet that is available online for FREE! I recently bought this for the length of the book (claims 264 pages) but it is not. I have recently had to deal with a close family friend suddenly dealing with schizophrenia and it has had a traumatic effect on his family and his friends. This is a serious illness that not only affects the person diagnosed but everyone surrounding them. The last thing anyone would want at this time is a book that claims to be something it is not!!"
3,Basic intro but not much substance,"This is a good basic introduction to schizophrenia with correct factual information. However, it is very short and does not offer much substance on the topic."
4,Good priced simple costume,"This is a good, 'simple' witch costume. Good product for price and just one night's use."
3,Overall this was one great show,I thought the video was pretty good but I think the director and editor (George Martin?) must be in love with the tamborine player. He's in more shot the all the performers combined. What a distraction!
4,What a collection of artists!,This fundraising concert has the most amazing collection of artists you would hope to see in any concert. I saw a more recent documentary about the career of Sir George Martin that actually showed his Air Studios in their derelict state in Montserrat today after the cyclone all those years ago. Such a pity given the historic music that was produced there.
5,Great Music,"This is a great music DVD I love it. Lot's of rock stars and loads of songs, I am very pleased. Money well spent, If you like this DVD you will love ""A Concert For George"" that was a ten plus+++++"
5,Music for Montserrat,"The most amazing music DVD I have ever seen. I have had many a party when this DVD was played that captivated the crowd. To have Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Sting, Phil Collins, Mark Knoffler and more all playing together is an historic event.DC"
5,Fantastic!,This is one of the best music DVD's I've ever seen. If you likeany of the artists listed on the sleeve -- and particularly ifyou like most or all of them -- you'll love this DVD. Claptonplays rhythm guitar on Money for Nothing. Knopfler playsbackup on Layla. Everyone plays on Golden Slumbers -- whichfinishes with The End and Carry That Weight. Awesome!
3,Great music... but the sound engineer should be fired!,"With such an excellent assembly of artists and such a great selection of music, this extremely poor quality audio recording wasted what was a tremendous opportunity for an outstanding concert video. Specifically, certain vocal tracks and mike feeds were not captured at all or with very little presence. Two examples are not hearing Sting's classic ""I want my MTV"" during Knopfler's ""Money for Nothing"" and not hearing Paul McCartney in a later verse in ""Hey Jude"". The music was great but these disappointments significantly flaw the DVD."
3,some good performances on this dvd,I wanted to see Sting and Dire Straights so that is the best of this dvd for me. a good buzz at the concert too.
4,"If you are on the fence, please read this review","The concert performances are par excellent... but when I bought this video, I truly thought it was defective. Phil Collins faded in and out on ""take me home"" and the sound was extremely uneven on many other tracks. I immediately logged in to check this and other reviewer websites and found that many complained about audio quality, but there were a FEW who DID NOT. After closer inspection, I found that there were two versions of this DVD-- one with Dolby 5.1 only (released 02/02/99) and one with Dolby and DTS (released 10/26/00). Well, I searched around until I found the DTS copy and low and behold-- audio is MUCH better on DTS format-- like night and day for me and my sound system is definitely NO great shakes.... I highly recommend this DVD, even though ths sound still won't quite rate a 5 star, but the performances and collection of musicians definitely come close. BUT buy the DTS version!!!!!!"
4,Great music by all my favorite artists,"This is a great DVD to pop in and just listen to after a hard day at work. The music is great, although I may be biased, seeing as how all my favorite artists are featured, especially Mark Knopfler. Sting's performance is another highlight, as he sings his standard ""Message In A Bottle"". You may want to skip Elton John after he does ""Your Song"" to get to Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney. All in all, a great concert."
2,McCartney Lovers Only,"I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead."
3,THIS CONCERT DON'T DESERVE TO BE IN DVD,"I'm buying concerts in DVD because the sound. This concert has an awful sound. I don't know why. It's a recent concert and with all the experience of George Martin, I don't know what happened."
3,I expected better,"Compared to the Eagles, Hell Freezes Over ( DTS ) this is lacking in every thing - it's fun to watch McCartney and others jam but that is about it."
5,All-Star Lineup,"This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert. The sound and picture are first rate and the list of performers is, simply, a stunning collection of British rockers. McCartney singing ""Golden Slumbers"" is alone worth the purchase price. I highly recommend it."
3,"Ok, but...........","I enjoyed watching this video but had a couple of complaints.- The sound at times seemed to come and go. One minute it was clear and loud, the next it was soft and garbled.- Since this was filmed in London it was awfully Anglo-centric. I understand that, but why only one song from Jimmy Buffett? If anyone can capture the spirit of the Islands, it is Buffett.- Who is the idiot playing the tambourine? We sure could have used less footage of him.Overall this is a good DVD, especially if you are a fan of McCartney, Clapton, Collins and Sting. If you are a Jimmy Buffett fan looking to add to your collection beware: the price may not be worth the admission,"
3,"nice greenhouse, but doesnt look like the picture","this is a fun little toy. i attempted to grow mint in it (it was on the list of plants to grow which came with the kit) and it worked well. I have currently ordered a refill package (it comes with new growing medium, nutrients, and a transfer strip) and it only costs $6 off the Uncle Milton website. my only complaint with it however is that it doesnt not look like the picture. the top of the greenhouse is flimsy and is hard to get on and if you barely bump it, it goes flying off. it looks more like a toy than a nice green house."
1,Cannot Recommend It,"This product has only one thing going for it. It's nice looking. Besides that, it's totally worthless. Cheaply made. Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter. After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes, I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash. It's much better. Sturdily made, snaps off and on very easily, same price as the Canon. Only drawback - no nice Canon logo."
4,Fits well with CANON 67 mm. Lenses only,"I bought this cap for my Canon PowerShot SX 40HS, but being previously advised I'd be using constantly a 67 mm. UV filter attached to the Lens (you must have the FA-DC67A Lens ring adapter for this). Otherwise it will be useless.If used as indicated, you'll have a cap that holds tight to the lens and additionally, will give your camera a terrific, nice look.Also, be aware this cap has no leash to keep it attached to your camera (don't forget this, to avoid losing it!)"
4,Works,"5 stars for functionality. This works perfectly on a Canon SX50 67mm Adapter ring. The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to keep in your hand when removing, but I feel the same way about the original lens cap that came with my camera."
4,Nice.,"the product is of great quality, and unsurpassed even Canon, I was very happy with the product. cap quality is excellent"
2,"Decent start, then rambled","This book started out fairly interesting as being an insight to the impact of too much money on children and the relationship with their parents. Then, it goes into what one reviewer thought might be an opium trip (which I agree with) that went on and on and on, boring after the first couple pages. The end was so predictable, the entire book turned into a major disappointment."
4,IMHO not for children,"I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad. But when it turned to what I guess is an opiate trip, it got downright creepy. Gave me nightmares.I'd heard of it forever and I'm glad I read it. But I would not read it again."
3,A bit of a disappointment.,"Over the years I've used a LOT of Haynes repair manuals, and gotten a lot of good information out of them. But not this one, for the Volvo 240s. It's almost like they got lazy, and just photocopied pages out of a Chiltons' manual. I've gotten multiplied times more useful information off the internet.Add to that the fact that the manual was damaged when I got it (looks like a truck had run over it several times), and I'm really not impressed.I'll continue to use Haynes Manuals when I can, but this one is a bit of a disappointment."
2,1 hour of static rain noise,"Ok i admit. I'm not a brain music expert. I really am not sure whether this CD emits sounds that will make me more creative or open up my alpha brain waves like the cover says. I've tried and I don't really feel any different. And yet I'm admitedly intrigued by the warnings on the label that say ""do not use while operating heavy machinery"" and such. However, the cd provides only a single song - if you call it that - that lasts for an hour - and its really just a low thumpy staticy rain noise that remains fairly constant and does not ebb and flow. Nothing really mind blowing if you ask me. Also, the packaging looks more backyard than mass production leading me to believe the $23 price is also a bit high. Ok experts, flame away! Tell me I'm simply not smart enough to get it. Perhaps that is the case... either way I guess i expected something different."
3,choose carefully,"Ordered these in my usual size, but they were too small. Tried the nextsize up and they were still short in length, but loose in the heel. Slipped in back when walking.Same experience for a friend of mine who ordered these boots. Nice quality for the price if you can get them to fit."
3,A Family Story,"This book has a more than one person biting their lips when found in tenuous situation. The writing is more than a little bland, and repetitive with a glossed over account of the actual crime which is approximately three pages long. The totality of the remaining 90% of the book is having us follow the interrogation and temporary arrest of one of the witnesses and the reverent, caring, Normal Rockwellian family through their grieving and processing. Nothing about the perpetrators lives or motives is recounted in anything but the barest of details. Mostly this could suffice as a very long diary entry about a family tragedy, but does not really need to be fashioned into a book. It was hard getting through this one."
3,Courageous memoir!,"I applaud the author's courage in wanting to tell the story of her murdered cousins & her brother & the way the horrible tragedy of the murders impacted her family. The story is well-told & plainly written, but the author's decision to write in third person (even when writing about herself) is clumsy & tends to distance the reader in ways that feel counterproductive. A much better read in this vein is Strange Piece of Paradise by Terri Jentz which blew me away with both the author's courage & her skill as a writer."
3,Great Title; Sad Story,"The book alternates chapters between home and police station, and although I ended up reading just the latter the story still haunts me and is worth the read."
5,A page-turner!,"I could not put this book down! The story is riveting and heartbreaking, and the writing is fantastic -- this reads like a novel more than a true crime. I felt like I was right there as the horrifying events unfold, and as the family deals with the tragedy and the injustices that follow. What I admired most is how the author, herself in the center of the story, manages to be so generous in its telling. We go into the heads and viewpoints of each family member as well as the four killers, and as a result we get a nuanced, thoughtful and balanced portrait of that fateful night and resulting tragedy. The killers are living breathing men whose lives and personalities converge to create this crime -- a senseless tragedy that robs the world of two amazing, spirited young women. The author calls the book her ""personal memory stone"" to her cousins, and it's a beautiful, heartbreaking tribute."
4,"Tell the tale, then stop....","The heart of this book is chapters 4 through 11, where we are given a taut, detailed account of the brutal attacks and of the hours of abuse suffered by the surviving victim at the hands of St. Louis homocide detectives.Chapters 12 through 15 (about 60 pages) cover the investigation, apprehension, and trials of the vermin responsible. Unfortunately, the author goes on to tell us all about parole hearings and execution stays and Ricki Lake and Court TV and thus manages to actually drain away some of the disturbing power of the tale she has so skillfully told."
5,Strange Twists,"This true account is well written, riviting, and perfectly clear. What happens to the young man is beyond understanding. Crime on top of crime is what comes to mind. But he survived to tell the story."
3,"Not Really ""True Crime""?","This is a page turner. I am not a ""true crime"" reader, so perhaps I can't speak as to how this book fits in the genre, but it seems to me that this book is something different than that (although it's true, and there was a crime). This book's purposes are i) a personal history and memorial, (ii) a therapeutic telling of a family tragedy, and (iii) an advocacy piece. Even as I write this review, the underlying story is still making headlines as one of the convicted murderers is heading to the death chamber (in two days) and claims innocence. And, the newspaper accounts still carry a suggestion that one of the victims might have some explaining to do - a dimension of the story that the book sheds a lot of light on. One important comment; I was interested in the book because of a local connection and I wanted to know the story better, but I was grateful that the ""crime portions"" provide minimal detail. The whole thing is gruesome enough."
4,Enter Slayer,"Like the famousMetal Massacre, Vol. 1, which is noteworthy for introducing the world to Metallica, Metal Massacre III's major claim to fame is that it unleashed thrash legends Slayer.The early Metal Massacre compilations are the best reflection of the American metal scene at the time, as such this 1983 release is full of power, traditional, and proto-thrash metal bands that are all clearly influenced by the NWOBHM scene. In addition to some of the ""name"" bands like Slayer, Virgin Steele, and Bitch, Metal Massacre III featured bands like Snowhite (later Znowhite) and Warlord that developed a cult following, as well Medusa, Test Pattern, Sexist, Marauder, and La Mort, who appear only on this album and were never heard from again.A lot of these bands and songs are raw and unpolished, but that was part of the charm of the early 80's metal scene. These Metal Massacre albums are a great way to revisit that era, and are a must-have for all old-school metalheads."
1,NOT what I ordered!,"I would have liked to know that the cord in the picture was NOT the cord that I was ordering. Not only are the connectors NOT nickel-plated, like in the picture, even the shape of the connector is wrong and looks to be smaller than the one pictured as well.My rating is more for the distrust I'm feeling from this company rather than the product itself, as it does work... For now...My recommendation: Don't buy this product, at least not from this company. You never know what you're going to get."
1,I imagine if you get a working one this would be very useful.,I had to rate this low because the one I received was broken or had some sort of short in the wire and didn't work. I'm pretty sure a working one would be very useful.
4,connected,Connected . Works well. Fast delivery. Great service. Great for when you want maneuverability while at computer and don't want to be tied to the four foot cord on headphones.
1,"cheap, but not worth the money","This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement."
1,Defective and more?,"I had 2 problems with the product. First the sound would cut out of one ear unless I played with the connection and second, using the extension caused the sound in my left and right headset piece to reverse (right sound came out of the left ear and vice versa). I have requested a refund and will not reorder if this is normal."
2,hmmmmmm!,i bought this so i can watch tv from the other side of the room. great idea. but some headsets dont work with it.. would have returned it but for the price ill keep it. you get what u pay for!
5,headphone extension.,"almost a year of use, and it still works great, this runs from our tv, to my treadmill, I exercise 6 days a week, and this is a fantastic extension."
3,Doesn't work wilth all headphones,"Luckily I have 3 sets of headphones because this extension did not work at all with two of them. On the one set of earphones it did work with, the sound quality is pretty inferior compared with the sound I get when I don't use the extension. Still it's good enough for listening to the news or dialogue on most TV shows. I wouldn't recommend it for listening to music."
2,I expected something better,"EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that's what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I've long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn't get what they expected based on the product description, I think it's safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I'd buy from another shipper."
5,Love it,"I am allowed to listen to music with headphones when I'm at work, but my computer is on the floor and it's too far for my headphones to reach, so I bought this extension cord and it has saved my life. I'm happily listening to music as I type this!!"
2,Good for about 1.5 years....,"I bought this in November 2005, used it almost everyday without disconecting it so no wear would be put on the connectors. Last week the sound quit coming through in the right ear. Surprising since the connectors are gold plated, you would expect it to last as long as my headphones which are 7+ years old without gold plating (and still function pefect. Anyway, it was only $2.90 from Part Express when i bought it from here, but the shiping was really high. So if you buy it plan to replace it in a year in a half."
1,Stopped working after 2 months,Ok while it lasted. However this cord stopped working after two months. Save your money -- this is junk.
5,Free at last!,"This headphone extension works great. I bought it for use at work, and it's wonderful not to be tethered to my desk. I may now move freely around my cubicle without constantly having to take off my headphones. It may be my imagination, but I swear the sound quality has improved too."
1,Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail,"Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first ""click"" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones."
2,Sound Quality is Lacking,Purchased this for use with my Tracks HD and as others have stated above the sound quality was greatly lowered for me and my left speakers sound is off with this product. Glad I didn't waste more than I did on this.
2,Great idea but mine's broken,"Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine. Some where in there we loaded it down too much and one of the slide in plastic brace ears broke and now it is unusable. Searching for a new way to haul groceries now..."
5,The BEST book I have ever read.,"This book has everything! Romance, intrigue, deceit, Religious persicution, War... with a discription and belief in honor, love and God that parellel my own beliefs. This book has been a multiple read for me and I will probably read it many, Many more times."
5,Awesome!!!,Very good book! Well written and a def must have for all collectors!!!! It's a little off from the movie but still as exciting as it gets you to want more and more Rambo!!!
5,Rambo III: This Time It's for his Friend,"Co-written by David Morrell (FIRST BLOOD AND RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II). Based on a Screenplay by Sylvester Stallone and Sheldon Lettich.John Rambo. The most dangerous man alive. His country has called him once again -- this time for a mission he will not accept. Living in exile in a Buddist monestary, far from home, he is finished with the glory and the blood of war.Now, his former commanding officer, Colonel Trautman, the only man Rambo trusts, is in trouble. On a mission meant for Rambo, he has been captured by Soviet troops on the Afghan border.For John Rambo it's a call to arms. And an invitation back into Hell...with the help of Afghan rebels."
5,Um album excelente,"I know that this wonderful band delayed five years to launch this album, however was compensatory. The quality of this material is surpreedente. The style of the band is gothic/atmospheric. In some passes of the CD, we perceive the influence of the Dead Can Dance. For who it does not know, the songestress of the band, Francesca Nicoli, is the same songstress of the band "" Ataraxia "". The vocal masculine is for account of the Andrea Zanetti, where the gothic style predominates. All the CD is excellent, the instrumental part is sufficiently melancholic, but gorgeous. The bands prettiest of the CD are, instrumental:""Battesimo: Nero Opaco "" (introduction), "" Consuming Jerusalem "", ""Fade to Grey "", "" On perspective of Spiritual Catharsis "" (Title) and "" Nephtali "". Who to want to acquire this CD, with certainty will not go to repent itself, valley to confer."
2,Melancholy views and interpretations,"This book, was far too long, and was not at all appealing. The length of the book, bored me to tears, and was too hard for people unfamiliar with his work (i am though somewhat familiar but still his theories made no sense to me and lacked relevance in my life). The book went into painstaking great detail describing dreams and interpretations. His theories and interpretations were intriguing, and informative, but lacked any research to back up his theories."
3,Pseudoscience,"For all those who need to get their baloney straight from the horse's mouth, this book is all the Freud you need to decide: visionary or fraud. I find it incredible that thousands, even millions, of seemingly intelligent people have fallen for something with so little objective evidence in its favor.Although Freud had little, if any, sense of humor, he is unintentionally funny in this book. For that reason, if for no other, it deserves at least an attempted reading."
1,A New Translation,"This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about ""infantile memories"" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult ""If Freud's Theory Be True..."" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."
1,Freud is crazy!,"I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so."
1,No Table of Contents,"Please be aware before you purchase this Kindle edition that it DOES NOT HAVE A TABLE OF CONTENTS. If you are reading this book for pleasure, starting at the beginning and proceeding directly, this may not be a problem. If, however, like me, you are using it for a course and/or in conjunction with a hard copy edition, this makes it virtually impossible to locate anything in the book or to navigate from chapter to chapter. You have to use successive approximations of the location number every time you want/need to change locations. Consequently, this Kindle edition is useless to me."
2,Poor Quality Binding,"Though the content of the text met expectations (it's a fairly canonical text), the binding on this book was terrible. It does not include any print or publishing information, making it nearly impossible to cite. There is neither table of contents nor an index, inexcusable for a text of this length and genre. The section breaks were unpredictable and poorly marked. Some new paragraphs began mid-sentence (clearly errors!) and often the section heading was indistinguishable from the paragraph in which it was imbedded. I highly suggest spending the money on a better quality version of the text."
1,translator confusion,"I have downloaded a sample of the penguin kindle edition, and while all the reviews refer to a new, and it would seem generally well regarded new translation by Joyce Crick, the actual listed translator of the ebook is J.A. Underwood.While this may be OK for the casual reader, this is not OK for someone approaching these texts in any kind of rigorous fashion.Whatever carelessness accounts for this error, it is enough to make me opt for a good old fashioned paperback instead.Fix it!"
2,Hard read,"Such a hard read for a non-psychology student - never to the point, ineptly organised, more 'jargon' type language than really necessary. Not worth it if you're not actually studying the subject or have advanced interest in psycho-analysis."
1,Very bad edition,This edition is really bad. It is really ugly and has a lot of typos. I do not trust the translation either; it does not even specify who the translator is.
4,"excellent literary piece, but based on mere introspection","Freud based his ideas from no scientific facts. There is no way to measure somthing as subjective as dreams. I enjoyed the the book as entertainment, but would not derive any factual information from it."
3,"Easy to Read, Hard to Finish","*Yaaaawn* I decided to read this book because it is the foundational text of the psychoanalytic school of literary criticism. T.S. Eliot, among others, lists it as an inspiration. Since lit crit is my bag, I thought I might as well read it. Yes, it is an important book about the reason why we dream and the processes that take place. It's ideas of displacement, condensation, wish-fulfillment, etc. are all important to literature, but this is the driest book I've ever read. Despite the clear, easy writing, it was a very difficult book to get through."
3,Cool Idea For a Book....Really Boring Read Though....,"I bought this book because I was having some crazy dreams and thought this might help me understand. I'm also interested in Freud in general. I am 29 and I really love reading books, but this book is just really boring and hard to read. It's a lot of technical terms and jargon. I don't really recommend this unless you are really really smart and like reading technical stuff."
1,Terrible book,My professor was not happy with this rendition of the book.He felt it was interpreted poorly and wanted me to buy another book.
4,Great Music but out of order,"I love the soundtrack, but was disappointed that the songs are not ordered as they ""appear"" in the film. The order on the CD then seems to be completely arbitrary. Still a great CD, but I think that it could have been better if the tracks were ordered properly."
5,strangely wonderful,"If you've seen that strange and wonderful movie, The Triplets of Belleville, then you should order the soundtrack. If the triplet's song plays over and over in your head, then you need the cd, because not only is it there three times (twice in French and once in English), but the French Mafia' s theme shows you those horrid clones perfectly. If you've ever wanted a recording of music by a vacuum cleaner, a newspaper, a bicycle wheel and a refrigerator, this is the cd for you."
4,Erreur,"""Les Triplettes de Belleville"" n'a pas reu le Jutra de la meilleure bande sonore, puisqu'il n'était pas en nomination. ""Gaz Bar Blues"" l'a remporté."
1,The Triplets of Belleville,This a terrible story - boring at best. I am sorry I wasted my time watching it.
5,Small but contains the universe..,"Another treasure from one of the world's greatest-somewhat-unknown poets...more more more is all I can say! To see his translations in his own hand is the greatest thrill, as well as the brief but wonderful interview at the end conducted by the editor and publishers. A true touchstone for living dharma and freedom."
2,Canon Battery Charger for NB-5L Batteries,"I would like to say that all of my dealings with Amazon have been wonderful, fast, and not a problem. The only reason I gave this unit a below rating is because the pictures showed a unit that just plugged into the wall, like the one that came with camera. When it arrived, I opened it up and I found a plug-in cable, then a charging box (gray), plus a battery. So I was not happy about the pictures not being the same one as I thought I had ordered, I was expecting the one with the folding prongs. Otherwise, Amazon would get a 5 on this review."
1,What a rip off!,I needed a charger because i misplaced mine. I an stunned they want $36 for this thing that should not cost more than $10.
1,inaccurate description,"The description stated that the condition of the charger was like new. I got it in the mail after about 2 weeks (from Japan), and it had scratches all over it. I would not buy from this seller again."
5,The real deal.,"I ordered this charger for my Canon PowerShot SD 880 IS. Fortunately, I ALWAYS go to Amazon when looking for anything. I found an ORIGINAL Canon battery charger for a lot less( half off!) than the Canon site's price & with Amazon Prime shipping & it's guarantee. I was able to order two for the price of one charger. They both came in authentic Canon boxes & sealed new. I have two Canon batteries for my camera, so I immediately popped them into charge. They went into the charger perfectly and charged within two hrs. I'm SO glad that Amazon had these chargers on their site. They're authentic & backed by Amazon's guarantee."
1,Said it would Work.,Im going to return mine they said it would work for my Cannon Sd1000 and it didn't I wish they did more research before saying it would work. It was cheaper than buying new though but I have the hassel of sending it back.
4,Great product. Can find other options for less,"Bought this exact replacement for the camera battery that I lost. I also bought another version that was 1/4 the price just out of curiosity. While this one works great and I would recommend it. I would recommend the other one more because of the cost and it comes with car charger. Either way, cant go wrong"
5,Great Service for My Charger,Thank you for great prompt service for the Canon camera charger.I misplaced mine a month ago and was in desperate need of a new one> Thank you so much!
5,Oem replacement,This is the perfect replacement to your lost charger. Not much to say about it. I like that it doesn't have a long wire. The electric prongs slide in and out of the back. Good compact and portable.
5,Works great,This was a replacement for our original recharger and it was a wonderful price. We are happy with it so far after a charge or two. We just bought some super cheap replacement batteries and will see how they fare. Was happy to bring the camera back to life with these purchases!
5,Exactly the charger that came with the camera,"If you lost your charger that came with the camera, this is exactly the same one. I looked for cheaper versions at Best Buy and other stores, but those chargers were all so much larger in size. This Cannon charger is so compact that it is easy to keep with the camera, and it seems to charge faster than the cheaper brands as well."
5,Happy with a Canon product again,This is a well made battery charger and very easy to use. No long cord with a plug. It plugs right into the electric socket. Handy to carry with you. I am happy with the Canon SD700IS digital camera and not surprised that any accessories would also merit a 5 star rating.
5,Works great!,"Got this to replace the missing one from my daughters camera. It works perfectly! We really shopped around but found that Amazon had the best price on the real Canon charger. There were many others that, when examined closely, were not actually Canon brand. We were not willing to take the risk of an off brand just to save a few $$. Would recommend to others."
5,Works as expected,I lost my original charger and needed a replacement. Works as expected. Charges the battery quickly and the battery holds a charge for a good amount of time.
3,Fine but not like the original,"Item arrived on time in new condition. Was Canon brand but wasn't like the original and the charger pictured. It had a cord to connect to the wall socket and the original (as pictured) has prongs that flip up from charger and plug directly into the wall. It is more convenient not to have one more cord to drag around for travel or misplace/forget etc. Anyway, my puppy chewed the cord after the first charge. Now its useless. Wouldn't have happened if they sent the original style."
4,simply handy,"I bought this charger for my parents on Amazon when they misplaced the original one that came with the Canon camera I had given them. It arrived quickly, it works well, and Amazon's price was very competitive. Plus, it enabled my parents to use their camera on a recent trip to San Francisco."
1,refused my return,I emailed the company 3 times requesting permission to return unused item and they never got back to me. I am stuck with a product I do not want that I bought by mistake. Bad business.
5,Just like the original one.,I lost the battery charger that came with my Canon camera this Christmas. Looked for a while for a replacement and found this one. Looks exactly like the original one and works just as good.
4,Canon CB-2LX Battery Charger,"Charger was an original OEM, but not the excact one pictured. it came with an axternal power cord. it was still a good deal, not worth fighting over."
4,Got what i wanted,"I got exactly what i asked for, works as expected, and was delivered on time as promised."
1,Mislead,"I feel that I was mislead when purchasing this product since when I googled replacement battery chargers for my Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph, this site came up as having a compatible charger. However, when it arrived it WAS NOT COMPATIBLE!!! It cost me the postage both ways and a huge waste of time. This vendor should be more specific in advertising!! I got ripped off on this deal!!"
1,The product never work,"This is the first time I buy a product from this provider and I will never do it again, they sold me a charger without a box and that looks kind of used, when I try to charge my batteries they never did it. After a couple tries I went to a local dealer and got a brand new that made a great job in a couple hours."
1,Another - case of can't download pictures from camera,"This was a Christmas present for my son. I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers. It seemed like a great starter camera for my son and the price was right. But it is completely useless*********** Save your money!!!I followed the instruction on the software CD provided (more than once). It seemed very simple but when I open the Dual Camera software, it will show me the pictures in the camera, but then locks up. The program becomes unresponsive. I have been working with this for hours and am completely frustated. If any one has been able to find a way to get the pictures downloaded please help!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I bought this as a Christmas present!,"Now my daughter will not stop aggravating me because we cannot download the pictures off of the dran thing and wants a new camera, so now, I have not only wasted my money, but I have to buy her a more expensive camera that will work that she will break or lose.Thanks so much Vivitar!"
1,This is a camera?? Sold in retail stores???,"I wish I could rate this camera -9999999999999999999999999999999. Actually what I really wish is to mound all of the Vivitar Vivicam 55 cameras up in a pile and BURN THEM. Anyway, I found this camera at Walmart thinking it should be good for the $20 price tag they were asking. When I first opened this wannabe camera I noticed the buttons were very cheap. More than half the pictures taken were either blurry and/or yellowed. Don't bother trying to create a video with this thing unless you like a still frame video. I brought it back after I did some research and found the Logitech C310 Webcam for several dollars more here on Amazon(which has HD!). This is the worst camera i have EVER used. Live and learn, and never buy anything made by Vivitar. Shop around and spend a few extra dollars for a better camera. If not, you get what you pay for."
3,Hayden 459 Oil cooler mixed quality,"The adapter body is poorly finished. Rough edges, aluminum shavings, etc. *Easily cut your hand on it* It requires deburring in a bad way. The OEM packing has this part floating around in the box. No matter how well the seller packs the box you are likely to find minor fin damage on the cooler.Aside from that the kit is pretty cool."
1,Amazon.com sent wrong size,Amazon.com sent the wrong size engine oil cooler than what I ordered. Rather than sending it back I made due but it didn't work out like I wanted it to because the cooler was wider than what I originally ordered.
2,"Fire the editor, sue the director, annihilate the producer","This must be the worst rendering of a live concert I have ever seen. I saw The Velvet Rope in concert and absolutely loved it! This DVD however is a disgrace to Miss Janets talents. The sound is awful and the editing even worse. All the dance numbers have been slaughtered in the editing room and there is no way to see the great choreography. If you like 120 minutes of Janet close up then this DVD is for you. Otherwise we can only hope somebody makes a re-edit and remix version so the world can finally see a worthwile version of the concert. What a shame, what a waste."
5,Great solid performance / Great Action / Great Music,"I first saw the HBO Special, and looked forward for the DVD to come out with Dobly 5.1. Fun to watch, and dance too. They did a great job on this DVD."
2,"WEAK, WEAK audio","Camera work and dance numbers were all greatBUTAudio is terrible! Not sure which bonehead was in charge of mixing the DTS but there is no bass, no surround effect, no presence. I've tried it with $5K+ home theater setups and this disc makes the system sound as if they were $3 computer speakers. I had the same issues with the earlier release, with the hopes that the DTS was done properly. No such luck!!Way to go Eagle Rock"
1,bad deal,"This DVD could not be played all the way through. I tried skipping past the ""bad part"" but no dice...it simply would not play. I was really looking forward to this video and will not buy from this seller again. The only good thing was that my money was returned (less the handling fee!) Feel like I was penalized for using this seller."
5,Excellent Concert By Excellent Artist!,"Janet is one of the best artists in music and she knows how to get a crowd going, even when it's home viewers with their DVD's. I saw Janet in concert as well and it's really this much fun. This is also a great DVD as well. Great motion menu's and animated chapter selection. Get the DVD now!"
4,No more Micheal's Little sista!,I reviewed the concert special. Janet wwas really good. I loved the choreography on Rhytmn Nation the best! and also YOU which was suppose to be a song dedicated to Micheal. Her dancers were remarkable!. The Rope Burn song is really hot I'm sure the guy from the audience felt the same. Janet has many moves like Micheal part of her show even remind of Madonna. Janet definitely has alot to show for her success.
4,I've always liked Janet and i think this movie is great.,She is very much full of life and her singing is what made me become a singer. The way she moves and spins is totally killer!!!
4,Great on stage presence but poor audio,"The DVD could have been better if the audio was as good as the video and that is not too much to ask. When compared to the Eagles 'Hell Freezes Over' one has the impression that a lot is left to be desired. Janet on stage presence however covers a lot, after all this is Michael's sister."
1,Do not waste your money!!,"This DVD will not load in your player. You will get a message, ""this cannot be played, not a compatible format"". Hopefully Amazon.com will allow me to return this DVD. This was a bad purchase for me."
2,Not one of her best...,"I didn't really like it. The best part of the show to me was the intro.She seemed to never change that boring outfit. She was way too thin, and her outfits should've been tailor made as they were drooping off of her. She appeared darker, and her hair was way too long and in the way.I do see some Madonna in here, but I don't know who's copying who because they both came out around the same time. But I guess Madonna beat her to the over the top concert extravaganza's.I also saw some of the same moves that Michael did.Her most recent tour seems better than this."
5,Janet!!!,Janet is at her best in this excellent concert! I love this video and have seen many concerts... This it top entertainment!! I recommend it highly.Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope Tour (Live in Concert) (DTS)
5,All Hail the Queen of Pop,"Okay, I'll admit it...I'm a Janet fan. But you've got to give it to her, Girlfriend is a fantastic performer. This video proves it. I've seen her live twice and this video brought me back to the great times I had at those concerts. She gives so much of herself that you don't mind the price you paid for the tickets. With that in mind, this video is a bargain at any price. Madonna who?"
3,alot of energy Hit&Miss Show,I think Janet Jackson has alot of Energy on stage but I don't think Her Shows are getting any better.I found the Last One to Be Her Worst Yet.this Velvet Rope one was Borderline on Good&Bad to Me overall.I Applaud the Energy&Drive She has but Her Vocals don't Hold up for long.Certain Songs work&others don't.
3,Stop putting Michael down!,"I am so sick of some of you people who just put Michael down when it comes to Janet's performances. We have to give props where it is due. In my opinion, if it wasn't for Michael, there wouldn't be no Janet. Somebody earlier stated that Michael fails to keep in contact with the audience. I don't agree. Michael keeps in contact with the audience from the beginning of his concerts to the end. When will you people see that Janet just copies her brother's dance. The show was great, but her concerts really are not as exciting as Michael's are. If you people have seen the HIStory tour it will blow you away. What I mean is that he had some killer special effects, and the lighting is tight! So my message is this, give credit where credit is due."
2,Didn't even know it was a play!,"Ok, call me ignorant!The only reason I bought this book is because I've heard of it before and I'm trying to read some classics.Who knew it was a play? Not me!A little hard to understand, but after I got past the introduction, I quite enjoyed the play itself. It was very funny.Not sure if you like this kind of thing, but it was just ok for me."
2,Not my favorite,"I found Man of La Mancha to be quite confussing. The plot is so crazy that it is hard to get a grasp on what is happening until halfway through the book. One you do figure it out, it is rather humerous, but not one of my favorites by any means."
5,An awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists...,"Simply an awesome 20 song blues collection by 20 classic artists (Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, Hound Dog Taylor, etc.) from an Austrian label called Wolf Records."
1,Immediately broke,"Broke the very first time I pulled the handle. Very dissappointed, was going to give as a Christmas present. Made very cheaply, only good point was that it arrived on time."
3,Not One Of Ms. Pence's Best Books,"Pence's book, recalling the 1994 murder of Warren Bondurant's girlfriends best friend, was a good read but not up to the caliber of the author's other fine true crime books. While the story is full of many details, which obviously shows that Ms. Pence thoroughly researches the cases she writes about, this book seemed to be written fully in the view of Sandra Underhill who was Bondurant's want-ad lover. As stated in the book Underhill provided many hours of interviews with the author as the basis for the book and I think this is why it seems so ""one-sided"". (I could not get over the feeling that Underhill really told some half-truths and sometimes not the truth at all) However it is an entertaining read nevertheless. UPDATE: as of the writing of my review Warren Miles Bondurant still sets in a Texas prison at the age of 71. He is eligible for a parole hearing in 2021, at the age of 86."
3,"Old game, somewhat fun. Repetitive though.","This is a fun game, but after doing the same thing over and over, it gets old, every now and then day will turn into night or it will snow or rain which keeps the fun going somewhat. This game dates back to the 1980's"
5,Another Great Addition To The Buddy Holl(e)y Story!,"If you are a totally out of control Buddy Holly fan (like I am), then this book is a ""must have"" for your library! It adds a great deal of information about Buddy and his performances in England and is well written and researched with some great bibliographic information!"
4,"Good Product, But Price Too High","I run 12 of these strips in my data center. They are reliable and the new online interface is very nice.Pros:- very reliable, never had one fail- online interface is nice and easy to useCons:-the price is quite high-the software that comes with the unit is Windows only"
5,The last Xbox book you will ever need!,This book describes how to do anything and everything you could ever want with an xbox.It starts of very simple by describing how to open up the xbox and take out the parts. But by the end of the book you will have covered such things as;-Installing Mod chips on all versions of xbox-Choosing the right dashboard-Learning the Xenium OS-FTP your computer and xbox-Flashing a bios and installing a dash board-Customizing your own dashboard-Replacing the case-Installing hard drives over 137GB's-Custom lighting-Xbox Media CenterThese are just a few of the many things that fascinated me about this book. A person who has never seen an xbox before could pick up this book and read it and have a completely pimped out xbox in a week.It is FULL of very detailed explanations and it has tons of very useful photographs.I would HIGHLY recommend this for ANY one who is going to open up their xbox.
4,Sweet,book helped me with what i needed to accomplish.Got the job done and couldnt of done it without it
1,The Black Art of Xbox mods,Good basic book on modding. The pictures are of good enough quality to make the verbage much clearer. More details on opperating systems with the Xbox would have been helpfull. One still needs the internet and a good knowledge of where to go in order to find the rest of the puzzle.
1,MODDERS RUIN THE GAME!,"You may think you are cool because you took the case off of your X-Box and (wow) followed a 6 step process to install your loser chip.But really you're just a cheater.Why are you playing?If you want to win games consider practice.It is a game.Once you start cheating now it's just a joke.Modding for the purpose of unlocking the xbox's media center functionality is one thing - that's fair use in my opinion, but modding to boost your rank is immature and ascinine.Why do you care what your rank is if you have such low regard for the game itself????"
5,Working cable,I had no issues running this cable through a drop ceiling and connecting it in to my devices. The connectors seem solid and had no issues during connection.
1,bad,The cushions fell apart- split in half and does not stay on your feet. Do not buy- very poor product.
3,Tight Harness for Altec Lansing IM7 Speaker System,Installation of this harness on the new Altec LansingAltec Lansing IM7 Speaker Shoulder HarnessIM7 speaker system was quite difficult. It fits VERY tightly and the snaps can barely be snapped shut. Hopefully it is secure and won't pop open and allow the IM7 to drop out. We'll have to give it the test of time.
4,great for the money!,"I was really surprised to find that this was really made of leather and actualy works. The pouch is a good idea for the remote and wall plug accessories. As there isnt really any good handle for the IM7, I am very happy to have purchased the harness."
5,awesome!!,"Makes the speakers portable, without this harness the speakers are difficult to handle.Altec Lansing IM7 Speaker Shoulder Harness"
4,Awesome system,Great sound in all ranges.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is b/c my iphone doesn't fit in it very well.It would be nice if the manufacturer could provide an after-sale attachment for new ipods and new iphones.
2,bad product,i received a damaged product I can not return because actually I Live abroad in Central America so is too expensive sentd this item for this reason I prefered waste this shoulder harness.
4,Brilliant design,"I purchased the IM7 harness and absolutely love it. It is solid and unobstructive for controls and speakers. For fun I even swung the unit, with IM7 in place, around in circles about 8 times at high speed to test its ability to stay secure.... NO PROBLEM!!! Hope you all enjoy yours too.Altec Lansing IM7 Speaker Shoulder Harness"
5,IM7 Shoulder Harness - Great!,"Besides being so happy with the IM7 Speaker Boombox that I got for my daughter (the sound is terrific, it rocks), the shoulder harness is great. You put it on the IM7 and just leave it on. It makes the IM7 much more portable. I love the IM7! And the harness. What a team!"
1,"5 star movie , 1 star copy !! SHAME !!","i love this movie, but when i watched this dvd version of it, i thought for a moment that my tv was playing up.the sound and image are dreadfull !!!! adjusting sound and vision on tv doesn't help either, i prefer copying a video tape on dvd myself.that's not all, nowadays we expect a dvd to come with trailers, documentarys etc.. you know some extras to enjoy the whole surrounding that made the movie. here: NOTHING ! nothing at allcompare this with dvd of ""mildred pierce"" or ""straight jacket""they come with FAB extras.this dvd version is done with no effort at all."
2,A tresured noir given poor picture quality by KINO,"The movie is a masterpiece of noir with performances that are superb. However, the grainy gooey VHS-like picture quality can only be attributed to a very poor and shoddy transfer by KINO."
2,Frustrated in my search,"Disappointed in the viewer comment on poor quality transfer from VHS to DVD which has discouraged me from completing my contemplated purchase of the DVD. Will keep looking elsewhere for a quality transfer.Am also stymied in not being able to find a CC version. I show these wonderful old film noirs to my 92 year old Dad who is deaf; without CC, it's impossible..."
5,Could be Crawford's Best!,"Joan Crawford & Jack Palance are sheer perfection in this tightly directed film noir suspense film. Not for a moment does the tension ease! Crawford has done excellent work in many of her large library of films, but this ranks right at the top. This is one to own!"
5,"Quit your whining, this DVD rocks!","Alright, there are no special features. Alright, so there aren't even any subtitles. And there are a couple of seconds where the picture had grain- ok, I give. But overall, this film is excellently presented. I don't have any complaints about the sound or the picture- in fact, I thought it was remarkably clear considering that it hasn't been preserved as well as a lot of other pictures. Trust me, the plot more than makes up for any minor annoyances.In an Oscar nominated performance, Joan Crawford plays successful playwright Myra Hudson. When she falls in love with a handsome actor named Lester (played by Jack Palance, nominated for Best Supporting Actor) everything seems perfect. But when she discovers her husband's plot to murder her, she designs a plan to reverse the gun.This movie is great, and if you're not one of those people who whine when they don't get all the bells and whistles, you'll love it too."
3,It was so noir I couldn't see it.,"For anyone who has enjoyed a good print of ""Sudden Fear,"" this DVD is likely to be a disappointment . My copy was so dark that I could not enjoy the performances (especially Joan Crawford hiding in the closet and acting by the whites of her eyes.)This is one of my favorite films, but I was not happy with the quality of the DVD."
3,Still waiting !,"Although I have not seen a ton of Joan Crawford movies, I am still waiting to see on that I really enjoy.From the reviews I thought I had found one but it turned out very slow and flat in the beginning and picked up a bit in the middle, but the ending was kinda silly.Loved having Gloria Graham and she made it watchable and Jack Palance is just creepy even in a straight role."
4,"Joan, distressed","One of the problems with buying Joan in the woman-in-distress in this movie is just that Joan is just not very good at playing it (She stares Palance down with the eyes of a gunslinger and looks as if she could take him out with one punch). Once she decides that she is going to engineer the demise of both her murderous husband and his girlfriend, we are in territory that Crawford is best in. But I am not saying she can't be good- despite the nutty scene where she finds out that Palance plans to off her (where she does everything but juggle while spinning her head around a la Linda Blair in ""The Exorcist""), she's good in this one. (Especially in the scene where she catches her reflection in the mirror with a gun and actually ""sees"" herself for the first time. ) Slighly looney, like most late-middle era Crawford flicks, but our Joan makes you buy it lock, stock, and barrel."
3,Maybe they'll find a 35mm print and do the DVD right someday.,"Campy fun film noir. Disappointing picture and sound quality, like a Dollar store DVD.I don't agree that the ending was predictable, not if you're predicting a logical conclusion."
4,Stylish Thriller With Crawford at Her Best,"Joan Crawford delivers one of her finest performances in this 1952 suspense thriller. ""Sudden Fear"" has all the classic noir trappings, with enough plot twists to keep you on edge. Jack Palance and Gloria Grahame are a perfect match for Crawford's cat-and-mouse theatrics - guided by David Miller's razor-sharp direction and Charles B. Lang's Oscar-nominated cinematography. Despite a less-than-stellar print and no extras, this Kino DVD is highly recommended."
3,Will Sudden Fear ever be RE-Mastered Sound & Video?,One of Miss Crawfords best films!It should be done right..How did Kino Video ever get the rights to this movie.I hope that one day some studio will do this film justice & Re-Release this gem with better picture & sound...Extras would be nice to...Aloha Craig
3,"BAD, WRITER, BAD!","Although I agree - a good, fast paced flick it is, I should like to warn those people like me, who have an allergy for those plots which employ the reccording apparatus turned on appropriately in time to record/tape a conversation which proves to be fatal. I mean, really..."
5,Honestly Raw,It makes us look at our lives as Africans living in America...trying to assimilate into mainstream America or maintain our Blackness. One thing that affirmed what I've always said is that we have to try to help whomever we can to realize their potential.
5,classic,"every young lady and young man should read this book in high school or freshman year in college. easy read in one day, get it, read it ,enjoy it, i did twice:)"
5,Life Changing Memoir,"I was in my early twenties when this book found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah's voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there. Not an easy thing to do. Sometimes its not easy to read a book chock full of opinions that one may or may not agree with; and that is the glorious thing about this book; new perspective, new horizons; freedom to think newly."
1,Offensive,"I'm a white female who is married to a black man. I'm outraged that she does not agree with interracial marriages. She talks about living in AmeriKKA, but it is her as well who promotes racist views. How are we to live as a nation if people can't be friends/lovers just because of their colour. Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that."
5,Simply Excellent,There aren't enough words to explain how much I enjoyed this book. Everyone should read this joint! I read it twice!
4,A Wake Up Call,"I enjoyed this book very much. Saw a lot of myself in the pages. Some good and some bad, I think all females should read as rite of passage. Will enlighten and encourage a different behavior. A book that should be read and passed on to others."
1,Racist and stereotyped,"I got about halfway through this idiotic (and extremely poorly written) tripe. Whine, whine, whine. Take some responsibility for yourself. Bigoted, empty, hateful nonsense from a vacuous, race-baiting hack suffering a dearth of originality, an abundance of misguided vitriol, and an excess of hand-wringing and pouting disguised as legitimate literature."
1,"No Disrespect? - How about ""No Clue""","More nonsense about the typical knee jerk, finger pointing, resentment that takes all focus off personal responsibility. Grow up."
1,No Disrespect,"You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."
3,50/50,"I would like to first say that this book was an interesting read as far as mixing racism and politics with drama. The author heightens intellect with urban intellect (intellect with street smarts or what is referred to as common sense). However, the drama is what kept me interested in reading this book. At times I felt as if the author's political views were contradictory and confusing until the lessons at the end of the book. Although I understand the authors reasoning for writing the literature in this form, I believe that the form that was utilized can easily distance a reader from completing the book. Overall, I admire how Ms. Souljah demonstrates the effects politics joined with racism has on everyday life for African Americans and Caucasians."
3,Mixed Views,"This book was not that bad,There are things that agree with Sister Souljah on and things that I disagree with.But for her to be so intelligent and have alot of book sense...She lacks a great deal of common sense and I honestly think and feel that she has alot of issues within herself to deal with by judging of her actions in this book."
2,"I Support What She Says, But I don't believe It","I read ""No Disrespect after reading ""The Coldest Winter Ever"", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. I found ""No Disrespect"" a non-fiction work that is told with the caveat - I will tell the truth, and the names are changed only to protect the innocent"", to be poorly told, hard to believe, and self serving. Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them. I don't mean any disrepect, but I don't buy it was the prevailing thought as I read her story."
1,Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors.,"Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is."
4,Insightful,I enjoyed reading about the people in this book. Her view on life in this country as a black woman was not watered down.
1,Not the real deal,"We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. We contacted the seller(Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet Store) and the claimed manufacturer (Warm Things). The manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. The seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. If you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them."
5,UNDER-RATED,"Fates Warning's Inside Out is hailed by a majority of their fans as one of the band's weakest, if not the weakest album. I dont agree with this feeling.Inside Out is similar to Parallels, but generally lighter. The lyrics are more focused on euphoric feelings. Its a light progressive fans dream. If you like the melody and passion of No Exit, and the lighter feel of Parallels, this is the Fates Warning CD for you. But do not buy this CD if you expect Fates to bring the Metal, because they dont.Inside Out is my second Fav Fates, next to No Exit."
2,Disappoitment,"It was first FW album I've listened to. And I'm afraid I'll never buy their CDs again. I don't want to waste my money. Well, I've heard FW is one of the prog metal monsters. Perhaps... Dream Theatre, for instance, doesn't have any such a pale album. This album has just some elements of progressive. If I have not heard it's prog rock group I'd never supposed it's progressive. Ok, the CD now is in used CD department and I hope I'll return some money."
1,Sci-Fi Natural Law,"Here is a recent example of this author's online reasoning, which he proposes others should be governed by in a free republic:""Let us assume that two planets which have not yet been inhabited by humans are to be colonized by them; on Planet Alpha, heterosexual couples only are assigned; on Planet Beta, only homosexual couples. In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why? The basic answer is to be found in the biological complementarity of the heterosexual couple necessary for procreation that is absent in same-sex couple. This is a scientific argument...""As I suspected, Natural Law theorists are about as serious as Trekkies"
5,Amazing,An amazing book that I couldn't put down. The Shuberts have compiled a great tribute to Broadway theater. It's worth the money if you are a theater history buff!
5,A Real Page Turner,Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages. This book is a fast read. The plot is exciting and moves. Jack has a way of making the tale come alive in your head. This book should be made into one of those disaster movies starring George Kennedy. It would be a knock-out! Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too.
5,Excellent,"The Freddie Slack collection is especially well assembled. It's great to hear these tracks again, particularly his work with Margaret Whiting."
4,Take the good with the bad,"Ok, before I bought this DVD, I read all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. IT WAS! She gets on your nerves. She LOVES to act, and she thinks she is really funny, but it gets old quick. On the other hand, I was so glad that I sat thru it because me and my husband learned so much. It was too late for us to get into a class, and this was really so informative, and it went over pretty much everything you need to know about going thru labor or having a c-section. So, for the people who said it wasnt enough cuz you didnt get to interact with couples or instructor, why did you buy it? Its great if you cant go to a class. What you learn is the most important part of this, isnt it?"
4,Great learning tool....,"For those of you that don't or can't go to a traditional class, I think you will find this video/DVD very helpful. My husband and I like it because we can watch one segment at a time. If we feel we miss something or don't understand something, we simply replay that portion. We ordered this video when I was about 28 weeks into my pregnancy. I would recommend this to others so that you have time to ask your doctors all the questions that you can't ask the DVD."
4,Can't believe the bad press!,"After reading so many reviews that criticized Sheri Bayles' delivery (no pun intended), I was prepared to be informed but also annoyed. I was very pleasantly surprised--I thought her wry sense of humor and presentation were an excellent match to the material, and I watched the whole video in two days of viewing. My husband and I had dropped out of our local childbirth class because we found the nurse there to be incredibly annoying and full of scare tactics, and this was exactly the tone I wanted--informative, entertaining, and fast-paced. My one issue is that I would like to have had footage of labor, as many childbirth class videos seem to include that, and it might have been useful. For simply getting the basic information, though, I thought this was excellent."
5,great,"I thought this was great. The complaints about sound and video quality I thought were unfounded. I didn't find her annoying and both my husband and I did laugh and learn. The breathing techniques are helpful and clearly taught, and being a dvd if you miss it or somehow just aren't getting it you can always rewind. I especially like this format compared to a class as I can review this any time I feel the need."
4,Kim's review,"These classes were a lot better than I expected. Most of the infomration was refresher, but there were several things that I never knew. The instructer doing the classes is hilarious, and my husband actually sat down and enjoyed watching them. These were much easier for him since he doesn't do well in a class room setting."
4,Pretty good,"I thought the video was certainly worth watching and it had some very good information in it. I plan to watch it again when I am closer to delivery and take some notes. This is our first child and we are overseas, unable to take childbirthing classes. I did find out that you can rent them on Netflix and so I'm not buying the childcare and breastfeeding ones, but I am going to rent them."
3,Eh...helpful enough for people who know nothing,"So this DVD was helpful since I had never had a baby and new next nothing about labor. The only problem with it is that it looks straight 80's and the doctor is so effin annoying. I wanted to reach through the screen and strangle her whenever she told jokes. But yeah, if you can ignore that, you will get helpful info on the stages of labor, when to go to the hospital, what's real labor and not etc..."
4,"""Roll your eyes and learn"" is more like it","Okay - The information given was thorough and helpful. I feel like I learned a bit more than I knew before. I'm definatly glad that I did a video and NOT attend an actual class.My husband and I watched most of it together, but I have to say that I watched more than he did. Although, I did fast forward through the stupid stories that the instuctor tells all too often. I felt bad for the people in the video who had to sit through all of her jokes and drama!I chose this video bacause it was more up to date than some of the older videos on the market and I think that the information given is current enough to learn about medical technologies for today.Just be forwarned that Sheri Bayles is annoying - Keep your remote in hand and your thumb on the fast forward button!Sorry Sheri- I know that you tryed to keep it from being dry, but you actually made it annoying instead."
5,The Perfect Shower Gift!,"Soon after my baby shower our doctor ordered me on bed rest. She said I wouldn't be able to attend a regular lamaze class and recommended this DVD. Happily, my sister had just given it to us as a shower gift. It was a joy to watch and very informative."
3,Sheri is the most annoying woman ever,"While I will admit that this DVD set is full of good information, Sheri Bayles has got to be the most annoying woman on the face of the planet. My husband and I often wanted to THROW something at the TV, because the ""voices"" she does to act out scenarios are so incredibly irritating. She makes all women in labor seem like either cowards and idiots, especially the ones who (god forbid) take pain meds. Honestly, you could learn the same info reading ""What to Expect"" or getting a different DVD."
5,Great product,This is a great product. We watched a couple child birthing videos and this one was by far the most informative and entertaining. Great money saving idea too with birthing classes costing over $100 these days. Highly recommended. Other videos in the series are great too (breastfeeding and newborn care). Good luck!
3,Kind of Boring,My husband and I watched the movie and thought it was okay. It had some informative information but otherwise for how much the DVD is I didn't think it was that worth it.
1,Long winded.,"This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you."
1,Spare yourself from this,"Turns out Sheri is the most annoying person ever. And, she really must hate women in labor, judging by the way she makes fun of them and mimics them with a whiney, high-pitched baby voice. Throughout the whole ""pushing"" section she talks about how much you will whine, and if you don't, just wait because you must not really be in labor yet. She goes on and on about how horrific the pain will be, but them she tries to talk you out of an epidural!! If she was my L&D nurse, I would cross my legs until the next shift change."
4,Informative but can sometimes be long-winded,"Overall, this DVD is great. It's informative and hey, you can watch it on your own time, according to your own schedule.The instructor was funnier in the beginning than I found her to be at the end, and she gets a little long-winded, trying to hard be funny about childbirth. But, that's what the 'fast-forward' button is for, right?Compared to others on the market (which isn't very many to choose from), I think this one's a keeper."
4,Great Info,I have to say that the information was very good but some of the comedy I could do without....I think thats what made it so long but other than that I liked the meat of the film. I also liked that it was something my husband and I can do without going to a class and that it didnt have a bunch of breathing exsercises that I wouldn't use. The one breathing (fucusing on a object and breath past contractions worked like a charm. I have also given that to my family member and her husband.
5,Very Informative Video!,I am so glad I did not sign up for in-person classes. This video fulfills that need. I now feel very well-informed.
3,She is annoying,"The videos give a lot of good infromation. The problem is Sherry's ego gets in the way. She tells annoying stories that she thinks are funny but they are not and distract from the infromation she is imparting. You could learn all the significant infromation in half the time if she would cut out the anecdotes and the smug ""I know more than the doctors atitude.""You are much better off buying a book on the subject or a video by someone who knows she is a nurse and not an annoying wannabe comedian. She also brags too much about her twins delivery. She has to learn that its not about her but the wonder of the birthing process."
5,"Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy","Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well."
4,"Good information, bad jokes","Remember that nerdy kid in the back of the room who thought he/she was funny but was actually really annoying? Well, she's all grown up and now makes childbirth videos.This video is good in terms of content. The facilitator's experience lends itself well to the conversation, but she has the worst sense of humor ever. Expect to learn, but don't expect to laugh. If you can make it past the bad jokes, annoying voices and face contortions, you'll get some good information.I'd recommend the video for the content in spite of the dorky antics.The couples are really nerdy too. If these people can have kids, believe me, you are going to be ok. Very reassuring. :)"
1,Take a class,Don't waste your money. If she had been my instructor I would have asked for my money back
3,Kept Skipping,"I purchased this dvd in place of taking in person classes. I think it prepared me as much as any in person class could have, but the darn thing kept skipping. I tried it in three different players and got the same result. Additionally, the instructor was kind of annoying, though informative."
3,Not Bad,"If you can get past how annoying the instructor is, this isn't a bad video. The information is good, though it can be a little one-sided in that the instructor makes it seem like the same things happen to every woman even though that isn't true. My husband learned a lot from the basic information segments, though if you have read pregnancy, labor and childcare books you probably won't. I was disappointed that they didn't show an actual birth because I wanted my husband to see it, but overall if you are looking for a childbirth class you can do at home, this one isn't bad."
2,There is no laughing in this video...,"There's not much learning either. Sheri is incredibly condescending when she mimicks pregnant women. This video could also really use some visual aids besides Sheri holding up a poor illustration, writing lists (that she doesn't finish) on a whiteboard and the worst...her on the ground, legs spread in high-waisted khakis demonstrating childbirth."
5,Complete classes at your convenience,"As a ""first-timer,"" I knew I needed to take a childbirth/lamaze class. Since I'm still working full-time, however, I couldn't imagine having to drive into town and actually sit through scheduled lessons. This DVD was truly the answer. We learned just as much as we would have if we actually went to a live class, if not more (I know this because I did actually go to classes with my sister a few years back). Yes, the instructor has sort of an unusual sense of humor--but she gives you tons of information, answers the questions you'd ask if you were there in person, and addresses the issues you were unaware of or might be afraid to ask about. The best part is I could sit on the couch in my PJs and hit ""pause"" if I needed a potty break!"
3,Informative but annoying,"Like previous posters have said, Sheri Bayles is off-putting -- she does these obnoxious and annoying voices meant to sound like women in labor throughout the DVDs. Furthermore, the cord blood bank sales pitch is heavy-handed and tacky.That said, I wasn't able to sign up for a childbirth class and I wanted to get a broad sense of what to physically expect during delivery, and these DVDs generally served that purpose."
4,Good Info,"I didn't get a chance to go to a birthing class so I don't have a basis for comparison but I feel that the video provided a good alternative for me. It provided straight-forward information and didn't overwhelm me with a bunch of different breathing and pushing techniques. She demonstrated just one of each which I'm sure will be easier for me to remember when I actually go into labor. My husband didn't think the instructor was very funny but I really didn't buy the video to watch a comedy show, I bought it to learn a bit more about childbirth. Even though I've read all the ""required"" pregnancy books, I think this video gave me the extra info and confidence I needed as I was feeling a bit stressed about not attending a birthing class. I would recommend this video."
4,Great DVD,"This is a great DVD, I almost thought some parts could be a little longer. I liked the questions from the participants, but it would've been nice to have a ""most asked questions video as well""."
3,My husband didnt turn it off ..,Well to get my husband more involved and prepared for birth I thought this would be a good idea . The video IS very educational . Is the instructor a lil cheesy ? Yes . But it doesnt interfer with the classes. She goes over everything ! I thought I knew everything already having 2 kids but she covered some things i wasnt even aware of . All in all its a good video if you wanna get your husband involved without losing him half way thro the class.
5,So Much Information plus You Can Watch at Your Own Pace,"I am pregnant with my first and this DVD was great. It was easy to understand and gave all the important information I need to know before I go into labor. I especially like the fact that I could attend classes at the local hospital, but my schedule is very hectic. This way I can watch it as many times as I need to and in the comfort of my house."
3,Lund Family Center,"I found this video gave excellent basic childbirth education. This dvd would be a resource for women who would like to supplement classes or if classes were not available to them. For the population I teach, I felt that the dvd did not include single mothers in the production which can be a barrier for some women."
1,Missing tons of crucial elements,"This video/DVD does not thoroughly explore all the elements of Lamaze preparation. The cover reminds me of Wilson from Castaway...he didn't know much about childbirth either.If you want to pay for only ~10 or so minutes of good information, spend your money. There are other products out there on the market that have a much greater wealth of knowledge."
2,blagh,"I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor. I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!"
4,Laugh and Learn About Childbirth,"The video was up to date which was very nice. Also, was entertaining, not dull like many others. I did not attend a childbirth class and this video gave me all of the information that I felt I needed."
2,TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH,"I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest."
4,Very informative if you can get past the mannerisms of the teacher...,"I agree with the other reviewer on all the CONS she listed. Before ordering I read her review and hoped it wouldn't bias me, but even my husband after viewing the DVD for a while became annoyed at the teachers endless and annoying attempts at humor and her ""funny stories"". It's a real shame she is so annoying because the course concept is great and better than going to class as you can pause and review at any time. I tend to fast forward when she goes into her ""funny story"" mode. The camera work is poor: at odd times it focuses on the couples--they are quite scary to look at--and then camera will shift to the instructor and cut off the chart she may be explaining or holding. Overall, the course is NOT very professional but it is informational."
4,Educational & Entertaining,"This DVD is not only super informative, but presented in a way that dads/moms can understand and even recall. If you have about an hour you can watch an entire session... and there are six in total. Only wish it came with a workbook or 'cheat' sheet of the helpful information."
5,Definitely worth getting,"We chose to get this DVD prior to enrolling in any local class. I'm glad we did. I've never gone to a class on this information so won't really compare a class to the video.This DVD was extremely informative. Yes, there are some antics and humor in the DVD that may not suit all tastes, but this is not a comedy DVD. The purpose of us buying this was to gain understanding of what's in store for our first childbirth, not to be entertained. If she didn't have some of the comedy and antics this would be a really boring dump of straight knowledge like a college course or something. I think she does a great job overall in the DVD mixing facts, concerns, choices, questions, and keeping us paying attention with some comedic examples and editorial.I would recommend this to any of my friends/family. It's great to own because I know we will need to watch this again at least once. There's a lot of content for review."
4,Great DVD for soon-to-be parents with busy schedule,"This DVD worked out excellent for my husband and I who don't have a lot of time to go to the traditional classes. We were able to do these classes out of the comfort of our own home, on our time and without the frustration of traffic, etc. Also, the DVD was less money than what the hospital wanted to charge us for enrollment into their classes. The sound fluctuates a bit, but it did not get in the way of our learning experience. I would recommend this DVD to anyone out there!"
3,Informative,"This DVD was very informative, but the host was really annoying trying to make jokes and funny voices every chance she got. It was hard to get through due to all the annoying comments and voices."
5,Well Worth It!,"We did not take a birth class, they were too expensive, cost too much, and who's got the time?! I did a lot of reading, and thought I was good-to-go... Women have done this for 1000's of years right? I don't need a class....Wait... Maybe just a short class. By the time I found this DVD I was 37 weeks along!I saw the reviews that the instructor was annoying, and tried too hard. So what?! I didn't want this women to be my new best friend! I wanted to see what she had to say, and I'm glad I did!After watching this DVD set I went on to have a natural labor & delivery! I knew how to breath, I knew how to push, I knew when to go to the hospital. She covered all the key points, and I would reccomend this to any pregnant women, and her coach. No doubt, it's well worth it!"
1,Couldn't finish watching,"Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes, but wanted a refresher before the big event. While the information is consistent with what we've learned from other professionals - the presenter is terribly annoying. Although we wanted the information, the jokes were so unbearable we had to stop watching. If you can deal with the presenter's sense of humor, you'll benefit from the information - good luck!"
5,Required Purchase for all Pregnant Mothers (and Fathers),"A major challenge of preparing for childbirth is the immense volume of information you are required to digest in a relatively short period of time. Most people have huge networks of people who give them tons of advice, which often serves to confuse rather than to enlighten since it is often contradictory. Enter Sheri Bayles.This product is amazing. It provides vitually everything you need to know, in a super efficient format. And with Sheri Bayles' witty presentation, the DVD is engaging and entertaining. Sheri Bayles has a way of making you feel comfortable and confident, by being honest, upfront and absolutely comprehensive.This DVD should be required viewing in all OB/GYN waiting rooms and hospitals. An absolute must buy."
4,Learned a lot and would recommend,"I checked this out from the library. It's the best childbirth DVD that I've watched. I learned a lot and appreciated that the instructor tried to make it less boring with jokes and stories. I didn't try to watch the whole thing in one sitting, so that might be why the host did not annoy me as much. My husband didn't like the host, but he agreed there was a lot of useful information. I also liked that it felt like you were part of an actual class with other couples. I was surprised that the section on banking cord blood is sponsored by Viacord. This blatant marketing plug annoyed me and seemed really out of place. But other than the Viacord plug, and maybe getting annoyed with one too many jokes from the host, you'll learn a lot from this DVD."
5,Very Helpful...........!,I loved this Dvd. It had so much info that I found so very helpful. I would tell all my friends to buy it. It was very intertaining and funny. It awnsered all my questions on child birth.
4,Great tool for new parents!,"My husband and I wouldn't be able to go to birthing class which scared me, I ordered this video bc of all the great feedback from reviews I read! I found this video most comforting and eased my mind. She is a great teacher! I would reccomend this video to anyone I know who are soon to be parents!"
4,Worth every penny!!!,"I was very pleased with this DVD. My husband works every day dusk til dawn and couldn't go with me to classes, so I purchased this DVD. It's to the point and it's funny. I would reccomend this to anyone that's in the market for it...I have already let a friend borrow my copy and she loves it too!Brandy"
3,Rushes through the important stuff,"I didn't want to pay $200 for a birth class, so I decided to buy a DVD instead. There seemed to be few options, and while this one provides you with some information, the instructor's attempts at humor waste lots of time, and as a result, she seems to really rush through the parts that are actually relevant and important, like comfort measures during a natural childbirth. I would have preferred she spend less time making bad jokes and more time reviewing pushing techniques and comfort measures. We fast forwarded through the cord blood banking pieces all together."
4,"CLASSES GOOD, WOMAN A LITTLE ANNOYING","Very good classes (very informative), but the woman and her voices were pretty annoying. My husband had a hard time listening to her because she's just a bit weird, but I still thought the dvd was good."
4,Informative but korky,"I really enjoyed this video. My hubby and I couldn't make it to a class so I enjoyed watching it as a class setting and getting a lot of great info. My hubby, however, had to hold the remote to fast-forward through the lady as she got carried away in stories. That shouldn't detract you from purchasing this, however. Just a fair warning for other husbands that are forced to watch."
2,"Rudimentary, though a tad insightful","It seems to attempt to reach out, but overall remains a small personal account of the trials and tribulations of an $8 billion/year industry. Just not professional enough for me to get my undivided attention. It was a worthy attempt, though."
2,Are you kidding me?,"First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. I love how she simulates labor by pushing a doll out of a wool hat....It was so realistic. I sat there thinking,'are you kidding me?' Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life. I would pull my hair out and ask for general anestesia if she was my labor nurse."
1,poor choice!,"Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural..... Babies and Women's bodies know what to do and CAN GIVE BIRTH. Interventions are sometimes needed, but this woman does not inspire confidence..... but fear! Look elsewhere for your information and make sure to read Ina mAY gASKIN'S GUIDE TO CHILDBIRTH!"
1,Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy,Incredibly inefficient information delivery. My wife and I tried desperately to watch it but just could not stomach it despite occasional useful bits. Incessant terrible affected attempts at humor and impersonations. Very old video. Pure torture.
3,Somewhat Helpful,"When we watched the video it did make us feel much more prepared for the birth of our daughter. She did have a lot of good advice such as using the birthing ball during. Nowhere else do they say that a birthing ball will help with standard pregnancy pain, but it worked wonders for my wife!When it came to our birth much of the techniques and advice in the video did not help. Of course every pregnancy and birth is different, but could ours have been so different that most of the video was useless to us?Her video does poke a little fun and is probably more entertaining to watch than others but, I would not recommend spending your money on it. Borrow it if you can."
1,not for the modern enpowered mother to be or her husband,"I will give her I did learn something while I wasn't being insulted by her gurgle giberish bad jokes. After weeding through, rolling my eyes and totally annoyed by this person, I did find out something. There was NO LAUGHING though. I found her unsympathetic unattached to the really beautiful thing that will be happening when I give birth. Just when I wasn't scared anymore after reading Ina Mae's guide to Childbirth, this woman made me feel aweful about the impending doom that awaits me. I am saposed to be scared and my husband an unhelpful weenie who can't deal, how can this women do this to the world when we've come so far. Unrelaxing and totally neurotic!! A huge waste of money and time. Don't buy it, I wish I hadn't. Really."
4,"A little painful, but good information","My husband and I bought this DVD as the thought of spending 12 hours on a prenatal class with people asking inane questions was too much to bear. I'm glad we did. Yes Sheri is annoying and her jokes grate on you very quickly, but the classes provide all the information you need, and in general she does a good job of spending the right time on each point without going into overkill. Unlike other reviewers here, I was glad she talked about how painful it is (because that's the truth!)....if you want no nonsense/factual classes then this DVD does just fine."
1,Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps,"me and my wife are both professionals. We bought this DVD for convenience over attending classes.The information provided in the DVD is helpful. However we found it is very repetitive, lot of time is wasted. The material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins.I would not recommend this DVD."
4,Fun toy,"My daughter got this for Christmas. She was 4 at the time. She liked the toy for about a month and then it's sensational value wore off. Don't waste your money. If your child is a big puppy lover, she will adore it. My daughter doesn't even care about the mommy dog now. She does like the little puppies that came with it, though."
5,Good Down Home Blues,I enjoyed listening to Big Wheeler. He played his harmonica and sang like the old Delta blues I grew up with. Thumbs up!
1,useless,"i was very excited when I saw the ad. I planned to buy a few of macro lenses, but ...the macro lens works only for the 1/4 inch distance :-(I cannot scan a business card or an article in a newspaper, but only a few charactersI really need a macro lens but for a few inches distance"
1,very bad quality!!!!!,This blu ray is horrible!!!The quality video is terrible!! is better an old whs!!!
1,The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever!,I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again.
1,Why an EP release of this film?,"While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode."
1,The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE!,"I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy. Apart from the Dirty Dozen blu-ray, this is the worst I have seen. I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray."
2,Slow and pointless,"Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it."
1,the worst picture quality i saw since old rental vhs,Previous review is right. Horrible! Nothing else to say about this blu-ray transfert.I cannot even write anything about the movie itself: I have not seen it! Yes after 10 minutes I could not stand such a bad transfert anymore and I stopped watching it!!
3,One of the hardest Dario movies to figure out...but WORTH it,"I have watched this movie about ten times and each time I come away with a different perspective of this film. Many may not like it, but just like Hitchcock, not all his movies are for all his fans."
4,Disturbing...,"I love this guy's movies so I'm a bit biased here. As far as horror goes, you could do better. It didn't really scare me too much, but there are the usual ""look away"" scenes typical of an Argento film. Plot: sicko tortures a cop woman and basically ruins her life. I stress not to watch this movie with someone who is easily offended...it will offend most! But for those of you who don't mind venturing into the bizzare and beautiful world of foreign thriller films, go for it! I doubt you'll be disappointed."
2,Terrible DVD of an impressive film,"The Stendhal Syndrome is an effective, stylish thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento. The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice."
4,Pretty Good,I have been taking this for a little under a week. I have noticed that my clothes are starting to fit more loosely. I have dropped about 5 pounds. No noticable side effects like some other products I have tried in the past. I am not jittery or my heart racing. Over all seems to be a good product.
3,sleepless but not hungry,"I've been taking these pills for a while now. The price is good and I have noticed that it reduces my hunger quite a bit, however one rather large setback is the fact that after I've taken 2 capsules at lunch time, I cannot sleep at all until about 5am. I just lay in bed, wide awake. its not good."
1,video player,"I really wanted to play the bingo game, however, the CD's did not play. I tried to play other games, to no avail."
5,You did it!,"I had to priviledge to get to know Izzy while he was recording his album in orlando, FL. He is an extremely talented and anointed young man. Most of all he is a christian behind the scenes and in his real everyday life. His production is super hot and his lyrics are uplifing. I hope that everyone who listens to his samples will buy the album and support my boy. You did it Izzy!"
4,An important addition to the mushroom breeder's library.,"This book is oriented toward those interested in developing improved strains of edible mushroom species. Highlighted species include Flammulina velutipes (enokitake), Lentinula edodes (shiitake), Agaricus bisporus (common white button, portabella, crimini), Coprinus cinereus (woolly inky cap) among others. Caution, this is not a how-to-grow book, but a technical reference for breeders. Reviewed by THE MUSHROOM GROWERS' NEWSLETTER, April 1993 issue."
3,In the Woods' first attempt.,In the Woods is one of those bands that never gained much attention from the masses of fans and were doomed to split after releasing a couple of amazing albums. HEart of the Ages is their first album and it finds the band venturing in a more Black metal path than the albums to follow. While not a bad album HEart of the Ages gets somewhat lost in the tons of other Black metal releases out there which is a shame since In the Woods were a very talented band and this is shown on their later releases Omnio and Strange in Stereo. Nevertheless this is an interesting album but not the essential album to get to know this band.
4,Read Haley's Diary!,"Have you ever kept a diary? In the book The Healing Time of Hickeys by Karen Rivers you get a chance to enter Haley's diary. Haley is a 16 year old girl who keeps a diary on her laptop computer. She names her diary Junior JT after her crush JT, but she calls her diary Junior for short. This is one of the funniest books I have ever read! If you like hilarious books or even hilarious movies, I highly recommend you read this book. Haley has never met her mom and liives with her dad who is a hippie. Her mom left her when she was a baby with her dad. Along the way, Haley gets the chicken pox, an awful haircut, and into a dilemma with a Ouija board. Will Haley ever meet her mom? Will Haley ever get her crush to fall in love with her? Will Haley ever find out what the healing time of hickeys is? You'll have to read this book to find out!"
3,Review from Alberta,An light enjoyable read. Karen rivers combines the style of bridget jones and Adrian Mole in this entertaining read.This is a fun laughable teen read! Great if you love those diary style books. I had a good laugh reading it!
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book, because I thought I will get some new insights on the big money lotteries, but I do not think there is anything of value there. I have the older book of Gail Howard; used to play Fantasy 5; 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 are the highest prizes I have ever won. Do not get caught by the hype: This book won't tell you how to win the big money lotteries - in fact, all that Gail Howard says is that it's very difficult to predict the Powerball ball, and the Powerball ball cannot be wheeled anyway. Guess I shouldn't have spent my money to learn that... The book is no different from her previous book, Lotto Wheel Five to Win. Well, the new one has some shorter wheels than the previous one (that is why I give two stars), but if you are into wheeling, you will be able to find them elsewhere. The book has a very long section (some 20+ pages) of ads about Howard's other books and software. Hey, you pay for that too! You'd be better off spending your $$ on a couple of extra tickets..."
2,Nothing New,"This is nothing new from Gail Howard, or at all. These wheeling systems can be worked out mathematically, without paying for this book. There are also lots of websites that offer number generators and wheeling system explanations for free. If you want it all spelled out for you then buy this book, but if you are willing to do a little mathematical work check out lottery information website like [...]."
2,"Not Very Useful Unless You Can Afford to Spend A Lot of Money, Buying a Lot of Tickets Per Game...","I found her concept very, VERY good, BUT, unless you're really flush and can afford to spend a great deal of money for a LOT of number combinations per game, it certainly doesn't increase your odds much. Now... there ARE folks who can afford, and DO buy, many ticket combinations per game... so for THEM this may be helpful; however, for the average person who buys only a few number combinations each game, this is a waste of time. Sorry Gail :o( !!"
2,Waste oF $MONEY$,"Waste Of Time & Money... I found that if you want to win big, just put the money into a savings account & watch your money grow! Pay YOURSELF not this author."
4,trying to win better,This book cuts down the odds with a better chance at winning lottos games. Very informative with many game wheels for all wallets. A must have if you want a better chance at winning than watching others win and wish it were you.
2,"don""t waste your money just buy the the lottery master guide",this book have almost the same information as the lottery master guide if you are a first time player or pro player master guide is the best. every other books out there is just waste of your money.
2,The odds are against you not for you.,"Winning is pure luck. There is no amount of strategy unless you are already rich. And believe it or not rich people play too. They can buy 100 tickets week. I cannot. But in reality it only takes ONE set of numbers to win anyway.Gail conviently leaves out this one very fact. 71% of winners are quick picks. The rest here and there over the years have been their own numbers. You cannot predict the powerball.The book has good ideas but how many people have won by using some kind of random system? I doubt any. It is all luck, pure and simple."
1,Incorrect Product Information,"The actual model of this meter is the i410, I am unsure where the number 617727 is relevant as Fluke doesn't identify it with this number. I suspect this is a component of some kit, which is defunct and therefore the reason for the strange model number. There are a few vendors that list this part number, but I also suspect this is a single-sourced inventory item. A lot of speculations, but what else are we supposed to do?[...]After one review that states the inaccuracy, AMAZON should have this rectified.There is not a valid excuse to keep a listing that is know to be inaccurate.That being said, the i410 is an excellent instrument.AMAZON is usually fair about inaccuracies when it comes to returns. If someone purchased this and did not return it, maybe AMAZON did not look at the listing.I suggest those looking for a current probe visit the link in this review and proceed from there. The review is for the improper listing."
