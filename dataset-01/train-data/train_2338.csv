3,"Optically Great, But Not Very Durable","I bought this item after seeing all the rave reviews for it and have to say I'm a bit disappointed. While the filter itself is fine when brand new, it scratches and smudges easier than most filters I've had at this price point (though it is also optically superior). I have no complaints about the smudges as they come off with some cleaning which is needed for any UV filter at some point, but the scratches render this product useless very quickly. I recommend the Hoya Super HMC Haze UV(0) series over this one in a heartbeat. I don't believe the Super series costs that much more (~$45 for a 67mm filter), and it is much more scratch resistant due to the excellent multi-coated glass."
5,Great wat to protect your lens,I bought this mainly to protect my front lens surface. It doesn't decrease image quality at all and I highly recommend using this as protection.
1,Terrible Quality,"I bought 2 of these for two different lenses. Put the first one on and used it a few times and when I went to remove it from the lens for a night shot the little piece of metal popped out and the glass popped out. I took the other one off my other lens 2 days later and same exact thing happened.I wasn't expecting a top of the line filter for the money but I was expecting one that would stay together! Terrible quality, I will never buy another Hoya filter again!"
4,Package not as pictured,"When I received this item the packaging and nomenclature was way off of what was pictured, I lost confidence in the item (Hoya), so, I used it on and off my 18-135mm lens, until I could finally see the difference it made when it was on. I must say I had previous good experience with Hoya filters but I doubted this was an original Hoya, but in the end I could see better color quality and it eliminated most of the haze I encountered, I would give it a five star rating if I knew I was getting this instead of what was pictured."
4,High Quality UV Filter,"Cost a bit more than some of the other alternatives out there, but if you want quality to go with your expensive lens investment . . . this is the way to go."
5,Truly Awesome,"What I like about it.1) Solid and not flimsy.2) Able to get into narrow fibrous branches.3) Able to pick fruit sideways in wide bushes with thorns (i.e. Lemons)4) Light weight.5) Fairly easy to pull fruit out of narrow crevices without getting hooked. The back part of the scissor shape can get hooked but easy to get out of.6) It doesn't crush or puncture the fruit.7) The rope attachments make it easy to use.8) You can access the hardest to reach fruit.What I don't like about it.1) Since it doesn't come with a pole, poles with extensions are expensive.*** The investment is worth not having to climb a ladder in soft soil and risk personal injury.Benefits over the fruit basket.1) It doesn't get rusty.2) Since you can twist the fruit, you can avoid breaking of part of the fruit skin with the stem (i.e.: oranges)3) It doesn't poke holes in the fruit.4) It doesn't get caught on branches easily. With the basket, I end up dropping and damaging a lot of fruit trying to shake and release it."
4,works just like it says,"Our extendable paint roller poll worked perfectly with the fruit picker. You just need to have a bucket near by to drop the fruit into. It does not work as well with smaller fruit, you have to make sure to grab them on the edge, otherwise the fruit slips thru the openings."
5,Very prompt!,"This ingenious device, sent as a gift, arrived at the recipient three days after I ordered it, and that included an intervening Sunday."
5,A simple but ingenious tool.,"We have an orange tree and always had to break out the ladder to pick fruit. That was more trouble than it was worth so it wasn't done very often. Also, reaching into the tree is a dirty job so it was usually a weekend chore. However, that is a thing of the past. This product has made life a lot easier and now my wife loves me even more. I go out early in the morning, pick enough oranges for a few glasses of juice, and she has fresh-squeezed orange juice every morning. It does not get any better than that. Thank you, Norris, for this easy and fun-to-use device."
2,Okay but clumsy,"Product worked but had to add my own enhancements for it to work with lemons as the ""grabber"" had too big an opening for average size lemons. Great for grapefruit & oranges."
1,disappointing,"Based on the numerous positive reviews I expected a better product. I wanted it mainly for avocados but it is not strong enough for most of ours. When we twist it slips off. No way to pull them off with it either. We'll probably get some use out of it, mainly for smaller papayas. Buyers should be aware that this thing is meant for a fixed-length pole. I need to adjust the length of my pole frequently and it won't work very well that way. Secondly, a pole with screw threads on the end seems to be mandatory."
1,Damaged Upon Arrival,"I'm a bit reluctant to order this product for a third time, as I can't manage to get one delivered that isn't cracked. Twice I've ordered it, and twice one of the loops that picks the fruit is cracked. Seems to me that the plastic is pretty brittle and cracks very easily, which makes me wonder how long it would last after you start putting stress on it to pull fruit from the tree? Anyone else experience this problem? I see that this is the best rated fruit picker out there, but it still seems pretty cheap, and I'm considering just getting a more durable basket style. I appreciate any feedback you have. Thanks!"
5,Great for New Railroaders from Superior Home Video,"You'll visit Rail Fair, the greatest exhibition of steam locomotivesever assembled to learn all about steam locomotives - their historyand development; how they work; top speeds; weight; and much more!Then, take an exhilarating ride on four of America's favorite steamtrains."
5,Great deal,I bought for a canoe cum camping trip -- fit every thing into -- love having the shoulder straps -- very satisfied.
5,texport float bags,"i love these bags, i have seven of them, they are great for canoe trips and car camping trips.i have packed these things with sleepings bags, blankets and pillows and dropped one in the river by mistake, everythingwas dry when i caught up to the bag 15 minutes later, it floated down a quick moving rocky river. I take these on family camping trips and boyscout camping trips, never had anything get wet inside.great price also.i recommend these bags to everyone"
4,Huge Dry bag for a good price,"I used this on a canoe / camping trip to hold my tent, sleeping bag, pad, ect. It is a huge bag. I like how it has strap so that you can carry it like a back pack. It kept my stuff dry for the most part but my the end the trip I noticed that there were small holes in some of the material at the top of the bag. This could have been just wear and tear from my trip. I would buy this bag again as it was cheap for it size."
5,Nothing comes close to this book.,"Before Ashenden there was Douglas Perry. Perry's book on VHDL (Second Edition) was pretty well written and handled HDL for synthesis quite well. After Perry, I was introduced to Ashenden's ""The Designer's Guide to VHDL"". This is by far the must have VHDL reference manual. Ask yourself, what is important in a good reference manual...the answer is well organized concepts, good examples and a thorough index! This book has it all. I have other VHDL books that just get dusty on my shelf, not this one! If I'm not using it, someone else usually wants to borrow it. If your looking for a great VHDL book...pick this one up or borrow it."
1,displeased,very unhappy with the quality of this bead & i thought it would fit on my pandora bracelet & it does not....cannot even read what it says on it too small & the white lettering makes it almost impossible to read...i was giving it as a gift & will not even do that. very displeased.....Donna
5,very cool,i realy like it very much my very best songs are picking up the peices and i was right it realy was good!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Good Overall View Of Battletech Books,"this omnibus version of three early books in the series is a good overall look at the Clan system; decent quick read, nothing very original, overly predictable; they added illustrations to this version and they're unbelievably bad, ignore them."
3,"Starts great, falls flat.","Sorry guys, but the Jade Falcon trilogy started off with tremendous potential but it got trite very quickly. The first book in the series was very promising and entertaining until about halfway through. The second book was meh. The third book was terrible. It seems that the author was writing under a lot of time pressure or something."
3,Generalized information on the area,"Good basic 'generalized' information about the San Diego area. I find when you use books like this one, you really only feel they sent out questionairres to businesses then selected a few without really feeling out what makes a good hotel for some and a bad restaurant for others. The lack of any map detail as they describe locations will make you buy another guide book to see what may be in the vicinity of a particular hotel and attraction anyway. So I would stick to Fodor's or Frommer's and get a book to augment it, not this one."
5,great dinnerware set,"Both my daughters and myself love this dinner set. This is our first set of higher quality china set. The shipping came in well-packed boxes, no damage would happen with this kind of packaging. So I decided to order another set of Mikasa fine dinnerware set from Amazon (without paying shipping and tax, it'll be cheaper from Amazon and you don't even need to wait for sales in local retail shops). We started using dish-washer for cleaning the dishes, so far so good. Not sure they will get chipped when time goes by. My daughters think the food become more delicious with these beautiful plates!"
2,Poster child of suicide?,Kurt Cobain was much more than just the poster child of suicide that he seems to have become.
5,The inside story of the Indian Army's triumph,"For those who read about the Malaya and Burma campaigns of 1941 and 1942, and wonder why the British in the Far East were initially so unprepared to face the Japanese, this is an excellent account.For those who wonder how the extraordinary growth and transformation of the Indian army came about, leading to the largest volunteer army in the war, trained, professional and integrated, capable of outfighting the Japanese in the jungle and on the plains, this is simply the essential account. The research is meticulous, the evidence compelling, the analysis informed.Three small quibbles. The maps used really do not reproduce very well. Some of the material in the copious footnotes might as easily have been in the text. And there is a tantalising reference to a mission which studied what American and Australian forces had learned from jungle fighting, without saying what they found out."
3,books,"Sent on time and in good condition, but seller does not allow group buying and SHIPPING so the used cheap book becomes very very expensive when buying 8 or 9 books at a time, way overcharges for shipping. Wont buy any more untill they allow multiple books with one shipping charge."
5,God created me book,I really enjoyed making this baby book for my son. I loved the scriptures that were in it. I highly recommend this book. Will buy it for my second baby.Thanks
3,It's ok if you're into storytelling,"I was really looking for a baby memory book which focused on God creating baby and not some stork delivery story. This book definitely fits the bill, but I find they are too many questions and details to fill out. I wish I had a chance to see all the pages, I'd have saved myself the trouble of ordering. Looks like I'd be going the route of a personalized photo book. It's a nice book, just not for me."
3,Fred Astaire Ballroom Dancing,Basic instruction in the Fox Trot & Waltz. Slow instruction and easy to follow. If you can't dance this will get you started.
2,Snob,"I'm Japanese and knew of this book in 1996. Many people applauded it, but I'm against them. I thought the authour seemed as if she had knew everything on anime, assuming an authority on Japanese culture. Ms. Levi takes a superficial view of anime."
4,Enjoyable & educational,"This was well written, a lot of fun & educational as well. A lot of in depth info but still manages to be a great introduction to anime for folks like me who really don't know very much about it. Answers some of those nagging questions about content & why it looks the way it does. Author has a great sense of humor - you'll enjoy it."
4,Great Book for Brand New Anime Fans,"If you are just now learning the world of anime and want to expand your knowledge this is a great book for you. It is extremely informative for a beginner and contains many details on the mythologies and customs of the Japanese which appear numerous times in anime and manga. You'll learn a few new Japanese words, and you can impress your friends, ""I know why this happens, what that means"" etc. Unfortunately it doesn't cover the reasons why anime made such a big boom in the States, only speculations. The author also makes false or unfounded claims of the origion of American morals."
5,"Good, interesting","I believe that Antonia Levi's book is very interesting, expecially for me that I'm very interested in this subject. I would also write a book like this about anime in Italy, and I would contact Antonia to tell with her about this phenomen. Thank you, and congratulation for the site!"
2,TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT,"I AM FAR FROM A PERFECTIONIST WHEN IT COMES TO THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF DVD'S. HOWEVER, I FOUND THE CAMERA WORK SO ANNOYING ON THIS ONE THAT I DID NOT ENJOY WATCHING IT.THIS DVD NEVER SHOWED MORE THAN 1/3 OF THE ORCHESTRA AT ANY ONE TIME AND NEVER SHOWED EITHER THE CONCERT HALL OR THE AUDIENCE. ALMOST ALL THE CAMERA ANGLES WERE CLOSEUPS. A TYPICAL SHOT WOULD SHOW HVK AND A ROW OF FOUR VIOLINISTS. HVK WAS CLEARLY IN FOCUS, AS WAS 1ST VIOLINIST. HOWEVER, VIOLINISTS 2,3 & 4 WERE PROGRESSIVELY FUZZIER. SAME WITH SHOWING FOUR TRUMPETS, BASSOONS, ETC. PLAYER IN FOREGROUND IN FOCUS, PLAYERS IN BACKGROUND BADLY OUT OF FOCUS. SO, A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE FOOTAGE WAS OUT OF FOCUS.THE PERFORMANCE ITSELF SEEMED EXCELLENT. SOUND QUALITY - LISTENED TO PART OF DVD WITH HEADPHONES. SOME OF THE 4TH MOVEMENT HAD BAD DISTORTION.GOING TO ORDER THE BOULEZ VERSION OF THE BRUCKNER 8TH."
4,Texsport Twin Air Bed,Good Twin air beds are hard to locate other than Amazon. It is just what we needed and so easy to set up. We put it on top of our pullout twin sofa. Now we are ready for grandkids and guests.
3,Seam came apart three weeks after it arrived.,"My son loves this snake, but the seam came apart three weeks after we received it. I finally made it onto the site to do a return and just ask for a replacement, but, of course, my window for return has expired.It's a cute toy, but not durable at all."
3,not what i needed but may fit your needs,Its made of cheap plastic and cannot withstand a drop. I ended up going with the saunders aluminum clipboard for around $30.
1,rubbemaid clip board,I liked the idea of the clip board with the pencil holder and extra paper storage. Its easy to handle and the size is great. So whats the problem.the spring paper holder is not strong enough to hold the paper to the pad.It keeps slipping out of the spring holder. I enventually took an old spring holder from a old one I have and replaced the weak one with the strong one. Unless your willing to do the same then do not buy this product
4,Great product,"I use this clipboard for work as a CNA and its wonderful. It holds all my paperwork, pens, etc with room to spare. The latch gets a little loose after time but still holds my stuff without popping open. It is a perfect size, have seen some others that are slimmer but cant hold much but paper. The bigger size one would be great for contractors and such but too big to carry around constantly like I do."
5,Perfect portable office,I needed something to carry all my project papers with me and this does the job nicely. It's lightweight and easy to carry. I like the separate storage areas in the cover....a great place to keep business cards. Have already recommended to co-workers and they have purchased also.
4,Four Out of Five,I've used this for three years now. A good product for on the go jobs. Nice to have a separate pen & misc. items storage compartment. The main storage gives plenty of room on the left for forms & the main storage area on the right side is very good to carry specific client files. Rounded corners are a nice added feature.I've dropped it more than once and one corner finally broke off the bottom storage compartment allowing small object to fall out. The latch has also become weak resulting in contents coming out several times. I am looking for a similar product with a better fastener.
5,Great Kennel!,"I love it and my cat loves it too. It is very light, easy to handle and very comfortable on the road."
5,Satisfied customer,I found the book to be an excellent copy and I was very happy with service i received.
3,Sammy Steals The Show!,"What a delightful film this is. Eartha Kitt really didn't impress me as the title character, but Sammy Davis Jr. was absolutely wonderful as Danny, Anna's fast-talking, wordly suitor. Frederick O'Neal also does a fantastic job as Frank, Anna's wise-cracking and money-hungry brother. Rex Ingram also deserves a mention as Anna's father, the man who kicks her out of the house after a youthful indescretion. I had never heard of this film until someone recommended it to me and I'm glad I have it in my collection of old films. For a film made during this era, it was funny without being exploitative or demeaning."
5,Great Acting,"I love it. I enjoyed watching this movie. I still could not get the father. I don't understand his attitude towards his daughter, when he was the cause of her hardships."
3,A must see for fans of Eartha & Sammy.,Uneven writing but great performances by cast. Eartha & Sammy are great together. Wonderful cast. A couple of over the top performances by the parents. Worth a watch.
5,My most comfortable summer shoe,This is my second pair. The first pair lasted 4 summers and looked and felt great the whole time. I bought the first pair when suffering w/ extreme plantar fiscitis. They were the only shoes I could walk in without pain. They fast became my favorites and a trusted friend. I use them for everyday walking and beach going. They are fantasticly sturdy and comfortable. They hold up to walking lava trails. The best arch support I've ever experienced in a sandal.
5,bright shine,"I use it to polish firearms works great on stainless steel if you want to win points with the better half, polish her new stainless steel refrigerator it will make it pop just don't use it on thin plated stuff because it will remove the plating"
5,Mothers Magic,"Most people beleive Mothers is mainly for cars, but I've found it is a great cleaner in the house. I was using it to clean the fixtures in my shower, and accidently discovered it is a wonderful cleaner on the glass shower doors. I highly recommend this produce."
5,MOTHERS MAG & ALUMINUM POLISH,THIS POLISH IS VERY GOOD ON ALLOY WHEELS GREAT SHINE AND LOOKS LIKE CHROME WHEN POLISHED.I WILL RECOMMEND THIS POLISH TO ANYONE
2,It was a hassle,Don't buy this product if you don't intend to use it on car rims. I used it for aluminum serving dishes and it smelled and did not polish at all. If anything it gave it an even more dull look.
3,uninspiring compilation,"It's a compliation, which likely means you will enjoy some cuts and not others. The ride from one artist to the next is not perfectly smooth; the artists are varied and there's too little of each one to fully engage the listener -- just when you start getting into one style, one voice, you're shifted to something quite different.Any music aficionado would be better off listening to a full CD by each artist. The individual pieces here are merely okay, and I say that even about the ones by artists I really like. A few cuts are entirely forgettable, and the good ones can be had just as good or better on other CDs.Overall there's more slow and melancholy than upbeat and happy on this CD."
2,Imaginary Size,I bought these shoes and ordered them in a 7 wide which I can always fit into. The shoes were marked 7 wide which is what I ordered of course. When I went to try on the shoes I couldn't get my foot in the shoe past the joint of my big toe. These shoes are in reality narrow. Even if they were medium width I would be able to fit my foot into them just not comfortably. The shoes look nice but that doesn't do any good if I can't put them on. I shudder to think what the manufacturer's idea of medium and narrow are.
2,"Does not sing ""I love you""song","I bought this item because it supposedly sang the ""I love you"" Barney song and another song. But it only sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and some other song about stars. I'm sending it back."
1,terrible waste of money,This toy was a waste of money! when i got it in the mail it did not work so i went to change the batteries an it was all wet and rusted inside. I was very disappointed
4,Barney Review,this toy is for my 2 year old and she will love it once she gets it for christmas but from the little bit i have messed with it. it Seems like a good purchase
1,"New Age garbage, rationalization of sex as enlightenment","Don't waste your time or money. [...] this is new age cotton-candy fluff, rationalizing sex as a path to enlightenment. That is the unorthodox or 'black magic' path of Daoist practices. People attempting the exercises described in books such as these have gotten sick..."
1,A Godawful Book,"I'm sorry, but I feel bad for the trees that had to give their lives for this! The author has no credentials as a Taoism expert, except for having interviewed other people with similarly shaky credentials about a topic that neither understands to any great degree. If anyone wants to understand Taoism, buy Henricks Dao De Jing and Saso's Taoist Master Chuang. Leave this poor doggy alone!"
1,Typical New-Age Tripe,"There's Daoism, and then there's a bunch of mushy New Age tripe which masquerades as ""Taoism"". This book is NOT about the transmission/spread of authentic Daoism in the West; at best it's a vapid re-hashing of New Age ideas couched in a vaugely Daoist terminology. Not recomended for anyone, certainly not for beginners looking to see what Daoism is actually all about."
5,Should have bought two,I recently bought two different stands for a musical production I performed in. I used this stand for my violin and was extremely pleased with it. I felt very confident that my violin would be secure once I set it down. I cut corners and spent a little less on a different stand that was not as well designed (and was cheaper) for my mandolin and was extremely disappointed. Lesson learned.
1,BEWARE! Chinese stand FELL APART! - Ingles says I'm SOL,"I've two of these stands. On one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. Mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!UPDATE: 1/9/12 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND. BEWARE! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................China. That may explain why it failed, but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it. I guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products. Well, that's his policy. That's okay, he's got competition, and I'll be purchasing from them instead."
5,I really love this,This is an awesome stand. I really love it. I will purchase another one for my electric violin. It's one of the better stands for violins.
4,No Frills,This is a basic stand that does exactly what you expect it to do. I did think it was a littl on the high side of cost so I would shope for a better value the next time i get one but all in all.... Happy!
3,a little disappointed,"The disappointment is not in her writing. Having been on a reading sprint of her wonderful novels, I had looked forward to more of her great storytelling. This book is different, though. It's more about a sharp transitional period in China's history. Although the history is good to know, a historical explanation wasn't what I was looking for. So this is my least favorite of her books."
5,This is a great book about the changes of China in the 50's.,"This is a wonderful book about the changes during the Revolution. There is Madame Liang, a wealthy gourmet restaurant owner, and her daughters and their lovers. It is extremely interesting in the high points of the book, as well as the extremely sad parts. I loved it and compare it to the greatness of her other novel, The Good Earth"
5,"A Moving, Deeply Personal Account of the Cultural Revolution","I have read more than a dozen novels by the extraordinary Pearl S. Buck, and this is one of my all time favorites. Buck's lucid writing, and deep understanding of complex cultural issues makes this a gem. Set against the back-drop of the Chinese cultural Revolution, THE THREE DAUGHTERS OF MADAME LIANG charts the deeply personal journey and loss of one Chinese family. There is a sophistication to Buck's writing that is not always immediately apparent, but once you become used to her voice, the deceptively simple prose gives way to deeply moving insights. This is a glowing, powerful novel about a family and a country at a crossroads. Don't miss it!"
5,Just my size,"Great product for my big and tall figure. Nice fit and love the longer legs that cover my thighs. Well made, quality boxer brief."
3,Byrne begins his FF run,John Byrne's first nine issues as writer artist of the FF are covered in this volume. The stories are inconsistent with #236 being the high point and 234-235 being rather bad Most of the other stories are just OK and Byrne is just starting to ink himself here so the art isnt that great. I would recommend this for fans of the FF or Byrne but not for comics lovers in general
4,Monocotiledoni,Il libro è ben fatto (forse un po troppo stringato nelle descrizioni) e le foto a colori precise e di esemplari molto esplicativi. Forse l'aggiunta di chiavi per la determinazione delle specie sarebbe stata un aggiunta gradita da molti... e la maggior grandezza delle foto sarebbe stata un plus valore.Il libro comunque rimane un must !
1,Very Frustrating,How do you expect us to buy cushions from you if you won't give us their dimensions????
3,Millet Not so Fresh,"Millet was falling apart, thought it would be more fresh. Birds still seem to like it. Will look somewhere else next time."
2,Millet Spray,Have purchased this millet spray twice now. The first order I was very impressed. The sprays were large in size and very nice. Very disappointed in the second purchase. The sprays were very small (about same size as ones you get in pet store bags). I was very disappointed.
3,Not as fresh as before,"Got the box of spray millet quickly, however, they stalks were very small and dark in color, indicating they were not as fresh as previously. Maybe the time of year??? My birds were not as eager to eat it as before!! Hope this is only a temporary thing!!"
4,WOW!,"When I had ordered from this seller,I was quite unsure if I had made a mistake.In the picture above the millet spray looks quite thin and about the size of these ones that some pet stores sell.Well to my surprise when I opened the box I was AMAZED!These things are HUGE and LONG.Lots of seeds for my Budgies and Cockatiels to munch out on.Though I do have one complaint NOT about the millet itself just the packaging process from the seller.I agree with another customer that they should bag them in plastic to ensure that they don't get wet and what not.The sellers responded to my E-mail very fast and were very nice!"
3,Pretty good for the price!,"I have enough millet spray to last my keet probably for it's lifetime! Most of it is pretty fresh, half of it is pretty dried out and boring and the keet rejects it. So what, it's cheap."
2,millet is dried out and falling off spray,"Your millet used to come in a bag. I found it fresh and moist.The last shipment was loose in a box and grains were everywhere when customs opened it.More importantly, I find the quality very dried out and quite poor.For the next order, ask if it is in a bag or loose."
5,good snack,"My parrotkee love it. it is very cheap compare to the store and very good quality. Thanks, will buy again."
3,I've had better.............,"It wasn't bad, but I still prefer Sleek and Sassy, I think there's is the bestbut when they run out and you need it, you try someone else's............"
2,Mostly ok,"It was a great bunch, large and fresh. They need to ship it in a bag then in a box. Because of weather, the box was wet and so was some of the millet."
3,It gets a flat tire near the end,"I thought that this book started with an interesthing begining: A woman dressing up as a man so that she can get the scoop on what was going on in the ton, to use in her well known satirical articles in the news paper.The author uses exotic settings and characters, a Russian prince, a books sellers daughter. Two very different types of people some how comming together and finding love with one another. This book unfortuately sort of stretches out to much becoming monotoness and boring. I guess you could say it gets a flat tire near the end. I was very dissapointed, reading the back of the book I thought that I had found a treasure, but instead I came up with a chest full of hot air."
1,not great,"This is the first and last book by Brenda Joyce that I will ever read. The characters were boring and without strength or anything even interesting really. For instance, Carolyn Browne is a tall and scrawny girl with short hair who dresses up like a man and practically drools over her love interest by letting him take her virginity without a care and then following him halfway around the world even though he is already married. It's just not very romantic or picturesque at all. I personally like to read romance novels that have a hint of fantasy in them where the characters are strong and fit well together. These characters seem to need psychological help and the writing is bad too."
3,Okay book,"Actually, I did not think this book was as bad as some think, but neither did I think it was as good as others think. My opinion only. It was recommended to me by another reader who loved it. The heroine was a bit too flighty for my tastes. I prefer strong, intelligent heroines, or at least a good reason for vacillating. However, I've read The Conqueror and detested that book, and I think that Ms Joyce has certainly drawn much finer characters and created a believable, intriguing plot in Splendor. My suggestion is to read the book for yourself and draw your own conclusions."
3,I agree with the reader from Hawaii,"I bought this book expecting a lot - Brenda Joyce is one of my favorite authors, but this one just wasn't up to par with her others. True, it started out interesting, but it got boring fast. The history bogged it down instead of helping. I would recommend buying The Game instead."
5,One of THE best books I've ever read!,"I read through the other reviews here, and all bring up interesting points and really just goes to show that not everyone is going to love the same book, however I do disagree with all the negative comments.I'm VERY glad that I did not read these reviews before I read this book... it could have sat on the shelf never read if I had and I would have been missing out on a wonderful book! My personal opinion, this book was very well written, with an exciting plot and characters that I fell in love with. I loved EVERYTHING about this book. It will definatly be staying on my bookshelf (which I cannot say about almost all the books I read, they usually get taken to the used bookstore for credit). And I look forward to reading more of Brenda Joyce's works!Just remember that all of these reviews are nothing but opinions, and you have yet to make yours..."
1,whoa!,"someone who took only a few days to write lyrics either isn't too intelligent or not a skillful musician. obviously by his tunes you can tell there is no talent. do not purchase. Really, you should learn to play the guitar a little better & stop making fun of people!"
2,Can I please have my money back?,"I am a fan of the actor Norman Reedus which is why I bought this film in the first place. However even Norman could not save this film. This film is disturbing to say the least, and the ending is just sick. If you're a fan of Mr. Reedus rent Beat, Boondock Saints, or Beatnicks."
4,Alright movie,The movie was ok. It didn't answer everything at the end and was kind of weird. The video itself was in great shape.
5,A real buy!,"In the event that you prefer ""Greatest Hits"" albums, this one is a buyer. While I have all but one of their albums, I have this one being their ""No Nos Pararan"" album is currently unobtainable. The best songs are ""Soy"" and ""Chica Boom""-which are my family favorites.DiNOBILI"
4,Great Book! Reads like a movie!,"This book was great! The history, the players (people in the book), the tie-in from other parts of the country/world. This is what needs to be taught in high schools and colleges in some form of American/Black History. We glorify the mob, but frown on the brown. Something is backwards about that and ""Kings"" shows the glory of what would consider a taboo in black culture.Mr. Thompson I'm trying to reach you!"
2,Poor quality,"I was very dissapointed when I watched this movie. Both, video and audio quality are not the best. It seems like whoever has made this ""legal"" copies of Rocio Durcal's movies is taking advantage of the demand of them after her untimely death. ""Las Leandras"" and ""Cristina Guzman"" (movies) have the same problems and they are only worth purchasing it if you were/are a hard core fan of Ms. Durcal and her early years."
3,An entertainment in fierce decrepitude,"Dr. Rof belonged to a human specimen that seems now on the point of being abolished. He was doctor, writer(he wrote about such topics as metaphors in Rilke, and also connoisseur of art.This book is not as profound as his earlier works but it has its charm all the same."
1,"Actual litter area too small, cats pee onto purple ""slide"" onto floor.","The litter box itself is too small and so cats will often pee and even poop onto the purple ""slope"" that moves up and down over the collection area. I've had this 1 week, and I've already had to clean up pee three times from my floor and poop once. I don't understand why someone can't make a top entry self cleaning litter box. I'll return this and go back to using my top entry box because there is not way pee and poo ever makes it out of that box and onto the floor."
3,only fair,"This is only a fair solution to cat litter. I have 2 cats and it did not last 2 weeks before the litter had to be ""refreshed"". It got stuck because poop got stuck between the tines and the back of box. The crytals get out of the box and are real crunchy on the floor. Also, there was suposed to be a fully loaded crytal box when I ordered it, but it was missing the crytals and I had to buy a box to put in it in order to use it. Also, the refill boxes are so expensive. I really do not think I would buy this again. Also, if you buy it to use and leave the cats alone, what would happen if the electricity goes out?"
3,Eh...,"The idea is GREAT, but the poop sticks in the grat... And the box really doesn't hold or hide odors very well. I am returning it and trying something else."
3,"Easy to use, costs more than you think","I purchased this nearly a year ago. At first I only had one cat, but I have since adopted a second cat.The scoop free is easy to use, easy to change the cartridge, I've never needed to scoop the box, it is relatively odor free (when it starts to smell, it's time for a new cartridge), and it is quiet.The downside of this product? I'm not sure what kind of cats they tested on, but I've never had a cartridge last two weeks, which is the advertised length of use for two cats. I average about one week to 10 days, and ten days is stretching it. At $15 dollars a cartridge, it starts to get expensive.Basically it keeps its promises, however it does so for a price."
3,Crystal Litter ONLY!,"Be aware that this product is only designed for use with the crystal-style cat litter, NOT clay litter. If you don't know if your cats will adjust to crystal style litter, try some in an ordinary litter box first before buying this! Otherwise it works as designed."
3,good product does not last as long as promised,"I've got a 10 lb cat who doesn't like a smelly litter box. I love this litter box for a week, but the crystals start to smell like cat pee and then she starts not using it and goes right in front of the box. I have 2 weeks tops for the trays before I need to switch them. I still like this better than the littermaid elite which kept getting stuck or simply not cleaning, but the trays for this one are really expensive and it adds up quickly. I have had the product for about 6 months and have spent $180 on refill trays.On the plus side- their customer service on the website is outstanding."
4,A great thing for healthy cats...less useful for old sickly cats,"I really think this is a great thing -- wish I'd gotten it long ago. For younger cats, it's perfect. I only pay attention to the sand box every other week, and even then don't have to touch anything really dirty. However, for my old, sickly cat, it's less useful because the cat already has very messy toilet habits, which means taking time to clean up all the outside surfaces of the contraption because the cat misses the box a lot. For him, it's easier to have a regular sandbox made from a cardboard box that I can completely throw out every few weeks. SO now I have both."
4,Litterbox is working perfectly after 1 year of continuous use,Litter box is functioning perfectly after 1 full year of continuous use. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the replacement cartridges are somewhat expensive (about $16/month at current prices). We change the cartridge once a month for one average sized cat. We will never go back to hand-cleaning a litter box. We also purchased an auto-dispensing kibble feeding system so our cat is virtually self sufficient for weeks on end -- we just change her water every few days and monitor the box. The litterbox itself is a bit on the small size so once a month or so she misses... we haven't tried a hood on the box yet.
4,ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box,"The litter box operates well and it does scoop the litter clean of solids. I have 1 cat and as far as not having to change the litter for 20-30 days seems to be hard to do. About 15 days after the litter has been being used the oder seems to over come you and I need to change the litter box. Changing the litter is definitly a snap. If you are like me, I was tired of cleaning the litter box everyday and this takes care of that everyday chore which I love. I just wish the litter box replacements were a little cheaper, other than that I am pretty well pleased with my purchase."
5,Easiest Litter Box Ever,"I have several cats, so I purchased several scoop free litter boxes. They are by far the easiest litter boxes to maintain. It's been about a month and I haven't done anything to them yet, they are about due for a cleaning now. They have made my life a lot easier!"
2,"Broke in 10 months, messy and stinky","We have multiple boxes in our home with two mature cats. I had this one installed because of the self-cleaning capability. The blue crystals scatter everywhere, even with a hood and mat. The magnetic closure (clear) that ""sticks"" to the purple tray that holds the poop came unglued so we need to repair that part. The litter is very expensive and I still need to clean after every poop, so whats the point? I would recommend the tidy-cat pellet system, it isn't perfect but there is much less scatter."
2,Not worth the convience,"After three monthes of use I will be discontinuing use because each time I cleaned the tray it has lots of urine under it. Yuck! My cat also likes to attack the rack everytime it scooped the tray. I am afraid she might hurt herself. Overall, not worth the convience of not scooping everyday."
4,Overall great.,"I can't quite give it 5 stars, but I do love it! My cat still doesn't know what he thinks of it after a month. At least he isn't terrified of it anymore. He is 8 years old, and has IBD, for the first couple of weeks he wouldn't voluntarily go into it, but if he was placed in it he would then use it...lolThe reasons that I'm not giving a 5 star review are more personal reasons than the actual performance of the litter box - Due to my cat's inflammatory bowel disease his feces is frequently softer than for most cats, so sometimes it gets stuck in the rake as it goes through the cleaning cycle. The other issue I have is that The hood that came with is too short / low for my cat - He is a very tall, long cat and he weighs 23 pounds.Overall: yes, I like it and would order it again."
3,A few design flaws that if fixed could make this a 5-star,"Right out of the box this thing was a godsend. It quickly became obvious that the litter was getting soaked and pooped in with my two cats at a rate much higher than the product stated to expect. Maybe I have unusual cats but based on other comments, I don't think so. We found the permascoop cartridge replacement and were lucky enough to get one before the company pulled a typical legal maneuver to block the selling of the things. Why they do not make a permanent box where I can clean it and replace the litter on my own at much less cost is beyond me. So I happily buy the ""Just the Crystals"" litter on here and maintain the box in a renewable and more environmentally friendly manner.This is the best little box I've ever had even with these problems and I recommend it. Just recognize going in that the convenience and cleanliness does come at a price."
1,"Sure it works, but NOT as advertised!","My wife and I have two cats (and a yellow lab :p)... we tried the scoopfree - deluxe for a few months before we gave up on it and gave it to goodwill.We have two typical not-fat cats who are fed a high quality dry cat food. The smell is fine for a few days, but any longer than 6 days or so and the smell is unbearable. God help you if you actually try to attain the 14 days as advertised; not only will the smell be unbearable, but you will have poop on your floor and the ""grate"" will get stuck.The replacement cartridges are far to expensive to replace every week! DO NOT BUY!"
1,"Stinky, Stinky, Stinky !!!!","I have had this for only 2 days and I have to scoop the poop each time my ONE cat poops. I does not have a ""sealed"" poop container so, it STINKS!! I dont know how anyone can say it doesnt stink. They must not have it in the house so, they dont notice the smell! The urine doesnt stink yet but, I am sure it is probably soaking through the cardboard bottom as I speak. I will give it another couple of days just so I can see if it does leak. Regardless, I am still returning it to Petco because of the poop stench."
3,So So at best.,The concept is great but the box is to small. If you have more than one cat you will go threw litter way too fast.The poop section is to small and never collects the poop. The replacement trays are a RIP OFF. If after reading the reviews you decide to purchase this be sure to order the forever tray and just crystals litter which are great products.
2,Meh...My cat and I don't like it.,"I see all these good reviews but maybe I'm doing something wrong. First time it cleaned on it's own, it scared my cat. It scared her enough that she didn't use the litter box for a few days. So I have to unplug it and when I see her go, I'll take her out of the room and then let it clean. The crystals DO NOT absorb the poop or urine. The poop gets stuck in the rails.I don't really like it. :("
5,Best Litter Box EVER!!,"I had previously tried a LitterMaid box for my 2 indoor cats. It was a pain to set up with many parts to assemble. It took me the better part of an hour to get it running. Within a week, it was clogging up and not cleaning completely. I took it back to the seller and ordered my ScoopFree. I took it out of the box and it was ready to go in two minutes. The cats took to it quickly and it is WONDERFUL. There is NO SMELL and the motor runs so quietly, I don't even know when they have used the box. Clean up is easy and the crystals last a good long time even with the two cats using it. It is worth every penny. My next purchase will be the Forever Litter Tray. I highly recommend this product!!"
4,Strangely and immediately irresistable to my cats.,"My cats are large - just not Maine Coon large. As far as ordinary domestic cat size, two of my five cats are large. And consequently, I go through the cartridges faster than 2/15 days. Even so, I rate this highly because my cats immediately adapted to using this system without *mistakes.* There is *no* odor or fragrance! I also discovered great relief in ridding my house and myself of the heavy bags of litter and the scattering messes I, the cats, and the hole-y bags had always made.I would change my review to 5 of 5 stars if Amazon allowed at this time."
1,Always dealing with the litter box...,"If you have two cats, this is NOT the right product. I have to change the litter tray once a week instead of once a month, as the ad indicates. The urine soaks through the paper trays and smells. The crystal litter doesn't get the opportunity to help extract the liquid (and thus the smell) from the feces as it is scooped under a paper hood where it is out of sight, but not out of mind (or smell). The trays are incredibly expensive compared to bag litter, even Fresh Step's crystal litter bags. The rake needs to be realigned on a regular basis. It is expensive, annoying and not worth its price."
5,This changed our life,"I moved from a 4 bedroom house to a 1 bedroom apartment and you would never know I had cats-- if it wasn't for the hair. You don't smell a thing. I hardly ever (maybe once per week) have to clean it out. Even then, it's not absolutely necessary. This works wonders. My cats adjusted quickly. How'd I live without it! Seriously."
5,scoop free litter box,i am 70 yrs young.have 4 cats and is so awesome to have these litter boxes.it was so hard for me to get BIG boxes of litter in the house.i have 2 of these and are virtualy care free.love em love em.
1,It's AWFUL & not cost effective,"Although it appeared to work great the first time, I have 2 cats who sleep most of the time (they're old)and I still needed to change it once a week. I got the plastic permanent box and still had to use half of a large container of crystals which did not absorb the urine. I ended up putting this in the garage for a future yard sale and went back to my littermaid that also isn't great but better than this."
2,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this item after reading rave reviews from LOTS OF PEOPLE.. I don't think I read one negative so I purchased it even though it seemed quite pricey as well as the refill trays.. This was a gift to my 85 yr. old mother who loves her cat but she cannot clean the box and has to have someone do it for her... I thought how perfect this would be. Wrong... It turns out if you cat does not have solid bowel movements, all it does is spread it out all through the litter and makes the biggest mess you can imagine. Her cat apparently has loose stools even though he only eats dry food.. It did not work period, and my poor brother had to come over and clean it to return it...Big mess. Glad it worked for someone, but a lot of money to not have some warning that this might happen."
1,Waste of time and money,"After reading the rave reviews I bought this litter box. It does work quite well BUT I am replacing the cardboard trays almost weekly, NOT monthly as the ads claim. The litter is very expensive and the trays are also very expensive. I then bought the plastic tray which is alright but you still have to spend a lot of time cleaning it all out because the whole thing stinks of urine smell in no time! Would not recommend."
1,self cleaning litterbox,This box did not work well for me.The front of the box was not high enough and several times my cat was in the box but pied outside the box.The litter trays were very expensive and not that easy to find without going to a pet shop. I really felt like I wasted my money with this product.
4,So Far I love it Except for 1 problem,"Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't so expensive to buy the replacement trays. Got the Scoopfree Ultra self cleaning litter box about a month ago and it works great. The only problem is the refill trays are very expensive to keep buying. I wish Scoopefree would make their own version of the ""Forever Tray"" since there are mixed reviews on that product."
2,Piece Of Junk!,"It's already in the trash, THAT TELL YOU ANYTHING?Cat didn't like it either. Refills too expensive. Don't bother.Next great invention???"
1,Not worth the price,"I give this box one star because it did reduce the usual litterbox smell significantly. We have three cats, so we change out the pan once/week. At $15+ for replacement pans, it's just not cost effective. We've now spent over $700 in the past several months for a self-cleaning litterbox that is already starting to wear out. The money would have been much better spent on a cat genie or litterbox robot. And holy cow, this thing is loud!"
5,The best I've ever seen,"The Scoop Free Self-Cleaning litter box is the best one I have ever used. I would give it 100 stars if possible!I have two older cats, who I was concerned if they would take to it, but both started using the box right away without any problems. One of the cats has bowel problems, and tends to be pretty smelly when he uses a litter box. He is also very finicky about the litter box being clean, and will go elsewhere if it is not up to his liking. The Scoop Free Self-Cleaning Litter box has solved both of these problems. The bad smells are gone and so is the problem of cleaning the litter box, the box does that for you!Another problem that this litter box has resolved is the sneaking of ""treats"" from the litter box by my dog (Some people know what I'm talking about...really disgusting). Now the litter box rakes the cat ""treats"" away and deposits them out of doggie's reach!I simply cannot go on enough about this wonderful product! I am finally fully happy being a cat owner!"
1,You'll go broke buying litter,"I bought this litter box for my two kittens. I am glad I bought it at a retail store, because I took it back 3 days later. The receptacle is much too small and fills up within a couple of days -- I don't know who can afford to spend $16 every three days to change the litter, but I sure can't."
3,Works Well - But Too Expensive to Keep,"The replacement trays seem to only last about a week in my household. It's too expensive to replace them that often in my book. Also, it might be fine for 1 cat - but you need about 1 box per cat to make it last for the timeframe touted in the description.I'm disappointed again. The good old fashioned litterbox still works the best."
3,Scoop Free Litter box,"I purchased the Scoop Free Litter Box, the litter refills, and the litterbox cover @ the same time. I absolutely love this product and the ease of use, (at first). I do not however, like the greater cost of the litter refills. Also, just a couple months following the purchase, the combing device within the litterbox lost the middle comb, so we have had to do more to maintain the box than I would have liked to."
5,Best investment,"This litterbox became my new best friend the day it arrived. My 7 year old cat used it right away once I put her in it and used her paw to scratch a little. My kitten used it after I put a little bit of regular litter in it. Now they both share it and let me tell you- it is soooo much better than regular litter boxes. The refills are a bit pricey, but totally worth it."
4,Our cat is a crackup with this thing!,"So far so good with this self-cleaning litter box. We had to finally cut off access to the old litter box (which we weren't cleaning to encourage our cat to make the switch), because he didn't seem to be getting the hint. Now he uses it without a problem. The only reason I rate it a four is he was definitely not enthusiastic about the switch.What is funny is when the rake starts, he runs over to the litter box and watches it with great interest. After it stops, he paws at the rake tentatively, trying to figure out what the deal is. Doesn't seem to stop him from using it, though."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"After reading through many, many of the over 500 reviews, I decided to try the ScoopFree litter box, since anything would be better than scooping cat litter every day and the smell.I really tried to have an open mind, some people are going to like it and some not so much.Well, the first problem is that the ""tray"" it pushes the poop to doesn't really seal. And the more poo in there, the worse the smell gets. As you can imagine, as a few days go by, I had to open that ""tray"" thing and get the poo out of there! The next insurmountable problem is that the rake started bringing the poo back out of the tray that it had just pushed in, and leaving it behind where the rake parked after sweeping the crystals.So my ScoopFree is sitting next to the box I bought in it from Petco, and will be returned today.I bought the Littermaid Elite 900 -- which didn't get near the good reviews ScoopFree has -- so it will be interesting to see how that one does.Good luck."
2,Kitty Litter box,I bought this after reading the review. My cat must be out of the ordinary - because in less than a week - the box stinks. Feces gets caught in the rake and i have to brush it clean. The blue crystals are tracked all over the house. I would not recommend this product.
2,omg smells so bad in just one week - 2 cats,I was so excited to try this product out since I just discovered I was pregnant and I shouldn't touch the litter. I was so dissapointed to find out that in just one week the tray had to be changed. It smelled so bad. So bad! I tried it out for 2 mths hoping something would change. I even mixed the litter once in a while like some recommended. The concept is great and it does scoop the poop to a separate compartment but the urine just stays on the bottom of the tray. I have two cats and one of them drops bombs sometimes but for this price I think it should last longer than a week. A friend recommended it and he has one cat and he loves it. Maybe its best for one cat that doesn't really go to the bathroom? Very dissapointed.
2,The write up sounded good but--,"I bought this because I sprained my right wrist and was tired of scooping litter from a rectangular box. I have two cats and realized the litter tray would only last two weeks and could be expensive. I believed the litter crystals would elimate odor. Well, they didn't. When the scooper cycles and moves the soiled litter to its box on the end, the odor that comes out as it lifts up, scoops litter in and then closes down, will about knock you over. So much for odor free, and I'm trying to keep clean because my house is for sale. I didn't have as much lingering smell from the scoopable clay litter I was using. I found a round litter pan at Petco, and have gone back to the regular litter I was using. And my cats are happier. They didn't like the noise this product made raking back and forth. AH"
2,Crystals Tracked All Over the House! Getting Rid of It!,"Although the unit works as advertized, the single house cat is tracking the crystals all over the house! The crystals are very hard and sharp, and hurt when stepped on in bare feet or socks. Further, with hardwood floors, the crystals are getting ground into the wood finish!Yes, we have TWO mats outside the litter, including a ribbed rubber mat, but the crystals are still getting tracked everywhere. Constant sweeping required. Very disappointed. I am so tired of stepping on them. And this is one short haired cat, too!"
1,Horrible box - save your $,"I bought this because of all the positive reviews so I need to post a negative one and my experience. I have two adult cats and after 3 days, the thing starts to really smell. I have to change it at 5 days because the crystals are yellow and the box is just toxic. I had a first gen. litter maid with my previous cat and it worked great because ALL the waste went into a receptacle. This did not work because while the poop gets moved into a little boxed area, the pee just sits there marinating in the crystals. Very disappointed with this box. I'm saving for that litter robot."
2,Love the concept but......,I love the concept of this litterbox. The unit functions as it says and holds up very well. We have one cat in our house. They must work on the litter part of this product. If I don't clean the box out daily our house starts smelling like we own several cats. I was dissapointed in that!! I certainly would never recommend you leave this box for 4 weeks or you will not have any friends left willing to come for a visit.
1,$$$,"I bought this thinking I was going to get a load off of my back and get a break from the regular scooping litter box. I went to the store and purchased the box on sale but could not find any more of the cardboard cartridges to change it with after the one it came with got old...so I brought it home and set it up- my cats got used to it really quickly and I was able to easily clean the box the first few days. However, when I went online to purchase more cartridges for it - a cardboard cartridge with 3 tiny pieces of metal for magnetism- a pack of 6 cost $89.99! DO NOT GET THIS! Your wallet will suffer!!!!"
1,Do not inflict this upon you or your cats.,"You'll get more satisfaction taking a hundred dollar bill and buring it.The cats saw this litter system as a threat. The scooping tynes would get bent out of shape. The cardboard cartridge would leak through all the time. The crystals have all the absorbancy and odor control of sheetmetal, and on top of that, the replacements were more expensive than any other litter product and only last half as long.The cherry on top? The cats would only pee or scat outside what they were supposed to while using this machine, never before and never after. This machine is a scam. Please save yourself the suffering and DO NOT BUY IT."
1,disappointed,"I bought this box to prepare for a Thanksgiving trip. While it had worked perfectly, I must not have done enough research. I was shocked to see you must REPLACE the pan and litter. I have 3 cats, so replacement at $15 each is an exorbitant cost. I later realized that the glowing positive reviews at the company website, were actually company generated. I emailed the company to complain, with no response. Needless to say, because I prepurchased this, I was out of the 30 day time trial. Does it work? Yes, but at a cost that depletes any merit of the machine."
1,"Smells terrible, crystal litter hurts","Our littermaid 900 was going so we replaced it with the scoop-free one, and it sucks. It uses this crystal litter that ""absorbs"" the pee, and it makes the whole room smell awful, and you have to pitch the litter and replace it all 1-2 times a week. And did I mention it smells awful? Plus the cats drag the crystals out with them and it doesn't feel good when a person steps on it."
2,Litter trays too expensive,"This product does what it does well however the claim that it will handle 15 days worth of litter for 2 cats is wildly optimistic. Our 2 6 month old cats can fill one tray in a week without breaking a sweat. As such I really can't justify spending $50-60 a month just to save me some scooping. If the price of the replacement trays was half of what it is (and I really can't see why it couldn't be, it's just cardboard) then I would recommend it but as it is I'll have to go back to scooping manually."
4,"Works really well, but one of my cats is afraid of it","This product does everything it says it does. I've been really pleased with it, and knowing what I know now, would have paid double the price. The only drawback is that after 2+ weeks, one of my cats (I have two) appears to be afraid of it and hasn't yet used the box. Great product!"
5,Worth the money!!!,We have a very large male cat who has had no problems with this litter box. As an adult cat we feared he wouldn't take to an automatic litterbox but the addition of our son has taken so much of our time. No problems out of the box and it is 2 weeks later. He was interested in the noise and movement at first but has overcome the curiosity of it all. We live in an apartment with little room for the box so it is in our bedroom. The noise is very liveable for us. It only take about a minute for the cleaning to take place. The litter box is approx. 5 ft from the bed. I love this box and highly recommend it.
1,Could not get the cats to use the box,"I had the highest hopes for this box & I have to say that the design is rather ingenious. I can't comment on the wet bottom issues that users descibe as I never got the kitties to even give the box a try. I think if I had it to do over again, I would *first* switch the cats to crystal litter *then* introduce the new box. I think both at once was just too much. On a very positive note, the company was remarkable about refunding all my money for the box and the unused cartridges. I was very impressed -- just sent them my Amazon invoices, they mailed me UPS return labels, and then sent a full refund check."
1,"Good Idea, Horrible Execution","I purchased this product based on all the glowing reviews, thinking it would change my life, too...used it for 3 days and it went in the dumpster today...what a waste. It WAS easy to set up and my two kittens took to it right away, but the odor and tracking was just intolerable. The biggest problem was that solid waste invariably wound up behind the rake, which meant I had to clean that...a far more painful task than dealing with my old-fashioned litterbox. The door to the waste trap came down onto the waste without securing it inside. The whole thing was a disaster. Finally, there seems to me to be no reason not to manufacture this product with a plastic (i.e. permanent) tray and have the pet owner use their own litter/crystals. Their refill system is unecessarily expensive."
2,Doesn't Work For All Cats,"This is not an impressive item. It relies on cardboard cartridges filled with Fresh Scoop litter. I've tried various things (replacing portions of litter with fresh litter daily, stirring daily, etc.) and it boils down to this...cardboard is going to absorb urine and then leak. I've seen large urine puddles on my floor in as early as 4 days after putting in a new cartidge. I do have a larger cat and I expected that I might have to change every 2 weeks rather than the 30 days that they advertise but this was too much. I was working much harder with this system than I ever did with an old fashioned scoop and pan. When you consider that a cartidge runs $16, and that the cartidge leaks, I just can't recommend this product."
5,Your Kittie's Dream,"This unit was purchased to replaced an existing automatic litter box which had ceased working. I am so pleased with the unit that I have ordered a second one to replace the other existing litter box. No dust, no mess, no odor! Truly a dream for your special kitty."
2,Good but pricey refills...,I have a scoopfree litterbox. It works well but with 2 cats you are lucky if you can get more than a week out of the refill. Moving the crystals around manually once in a while helps to extend the life. I have even bought some extra crystals to add in to try and get 2 weeks out of the refill. At $16 a pop you are looking at $60 a month just to fill it. I thinking about going with a litter maid so I can just buy litter.
4,Keeps litter box cleaner than I can,"The first week I was so amazed with this item and how it neatly tucked away our cats' poop. The cats seemed to love it as well as they enjoyed a litter box that was cleaner than I could keep it. However, if you stick to the disposable trays it can be very costly. Maybe that's just the case for us as we have two cats and they go through it quicker. For us a tray lasts 7 to 10 days but no more than that because the grate doesn't scoop up the pee as well as it does the poop. So, we go through about 3 trays per month, which is a lot of cardboard and litter which keeps me from giving this item a fifth star. However, replacing the tray is very easy. I'm considering ordering a permanent tray in the meantime."
2,Works inconsistently!,"The motion detector on this system is not very good. Even if my cats spend a fairly long time in the tray doing their business, the motion detector only trips the scooper sometimes (the light blinks while they're in the tray, indicating that the motion sensor knows they are there, but once they've gone it's supposed to keep blinking until the poop has dried and it auto-scoops. Instead it stops blinking when the cats leave the tray and it never scoops). It has gone for days not detecting the cats, then might work once. In the meantime, the tray has gotten full of poop. When it does work, it's pretty good, but after 2 weeks (with 2 cats) it stinks! And I've had to scoop out the poop at least every 4th day to keep it from getting overly full (it has a very small 'reservoir' for the old poop).I'm not impressed. I don't have to scoop every day, but I do have to push the button myself to make it work, so it isn't useful for the long weekends away I'd hoped it would be great for."
2,Litter box not all its crapped up to be!,"Spent too much for this. Refills needed every 2 weeks- at least. Depends on number of cats! Refills are not cheap and only found at big pet store chains. But I'm not scooping the litter everyday anymore, that is the only good thing about this litter box."
1,VERY POOR DESIGN,"I bought this when the Forever litter tray was available. Just after that, the company that makes the litter box, went to court to keep the Forever tray from being produced and sold. As a result, all you can buy for this are their disposable boxes which are VERY expensive and LEAK. Who wants to have cat pee on their floors, that's the whole reason we have litter boxes, to keep it off our floors. SO, the product should either be updated to have a longer lasting leak proof tray available (the producers have NO PLANS to make the tray available themselves.) Or, the disposables should at the very least should not leak. VERY POOR PRODUCE - I would have given it no stars if possible."
3,"One year later, mixed feelings.",I have owned this product for almost one year. After one year the novelty of not having to scoop poop wears off and the frequent and expensive changing of trays is even more annoying. It's not worth owning unless you get the Forever Litter Tray and corresponding Just Crystals. For my two medium-sized cats we still have to clean the poop trap and change the crystals AT LEAST once every five days.
3,Needs air conditioning and a certain kind of cat,"The litter is made of silica crystals. These absorb the urine and dry out the poo which is then easily shoveled into the auto closing receptacle at the end of the unit. The problem is if it's summer and you don't have AC, the crystals aren't going to work. It's going to stink really bad.My main issue with this however is the litter. This type of litter isn't comfortable for the cats- in fact, for some cats with sensitive paws it can be painful. Our cat hated using it and whined every time. We got a regular clay litter box next to it and he immediately started using that and never went back to this one. No more whining. No more sore paws.Other than that, it worked as advertised."
3,Not Quite Met My Expectations,"With its high overall rating, I was quite excited about it. Its advertising says it hides odor, and there's no cleaning involved -- well not quite true. Now and then smaller pieces would get stuck in the rack; and with the poop cover not exactly well sealed off, you can definitely smell it after a few days. My last complaint is that it's a bit loud when the self-scooping kicks off.For someone who has a garage or basement to keep the litterbox out of main living area will work well. For condo/apartment living and having to keep the litterbox in the guest bathroom, it was definitely less than perfect."
4,"Some very small waste gets caught in teeth of cleaner, otherwise great!","Because of the above comment. Sometimes the teeth of the cleaner catch small poop and they get stuck in it. Therefore, I have to clean them out by hand."
2,Stinks!,"This litter box stinks! Literally! After two days! First let me say that I have two cats and they aren't very stinky. So, I was surprised after day one of the transition (it took me a week to train them to this new box) to walk into my apt to smell poop and the next day to smell urine coming from the box... strong urine as if no odor control. I think the crystal litter is mainly to blame - I was using the premium blue crystals made for this box. Also, the compartment that the poop scoops into (when it worked) isn't completely airtight.. perhaps this causes odor to escape? I had the timer on 20 minutes so the litter should have had time to work it's magic (as I read in another review). I said ""when it worked"" because one day it fell short of scooping the poop into the compartment for some reason. After two weeks I had to return the box. The idea is great but not the smell! I'm so disappointed!"
2,Scoopfree litter box,"I have had this litter box since 12/9/10. for 1 cat, each litter tray is supposed to last 20-25 days... for my cat it lasts 6-7 days. I am getting ready to start my 6th tray. This could be way to expensive for the way my cat operates. However, I am going to order more trays and see how it works for the next month. If it stays the same I will have to return the product. But I must say that if my cat wasnt a super pee'er... than I would like the product. I do not miss cleaning a litter box everyday!"
3,Make sure your floor is level,"With no bottom connecting the sides, the Scoop Free unit is essentially a rectangular frame. The disposable litter pan fits in the center of the frame and rests on the floor. If the unit is not on a level surface, the disposable pan does not fit properly in the frame: the rake (or part of the rake) either gets stuck in or moves over the top of the litter. I did not have this problem with my Litter Maid - Litter Maids have their own bottoms, so there are no fitment issues. I like the premise of the Scoop Free unit. I wish that the Scoop Free had a solid bottom and that the disposable pan were placed on top of it. The solid bottom would make the unit rigid enough to be used on unlevel surfaces. It would also protect floors in the event that the litter pan became saturated. ."
2,Did not like this item,"I purchased this item after my litermaid auto box expired. I ended up going out and buying the litermaid box again. This box does not keep up enough with multiple cats, when a cat had a bowel movement I could smell it through out the house. The cost of upkeep was too high. I was buying a refill box every week, that was running me $80 a month to upkeep."
2,If only they didn't break after a year,"I loved this product. I have two large cats and this worked beautifully. I changed the cartridge every two weeks, which took me less than 5 minutes, and that's it. It stopped odors very well and tracking was minimal. I am now having to throw away my second unit based on the fact that after a year the rake no longer works automatically. It only cycles when I press the button which completely eliminates the convenience of only having to think about it once every two weeks. For as much money as the cartridges cost, it's not worth it.After having the same problem, at roughly the same time for two units, I'm not willing to sink any more money into this product. I wish that the manufacturers would make this a heartier unit and I'd get another, but for now I'm going back to the old standards as none of the techno options seem to keep up their end of the ""bargain""."
4,Litter Box,"The box works great every time, it is however VERY loud! Which I can look over, because it works every time. I have two cats, so I change the litter every two-three weeks. Absolutely no maintenance needed in between changes, which I love!"
2,What they don't tell you,"You'll spend a whole lot on this product, you'll need to buy the product liner on line and they will need to be changed out frequently. Most retail outlets do not carry the liners. Not worth the $$$"
4,Best of the lot except for a few crucial mistakes,"I've been searching for an auto litter box for a month now. I've compared the LM900, LME9000, and Scoopfree Ultra. Except for a few crucial mistakes, I would have kept this one:- high monthly cost, even if one were to reuse the trays or buy a reusable one, the crystals are harder to find and are much more expensive. They should have included a reusable tray- the poop collection area is too small and the gaps are too big, poop-jerky has a super potent odor!- unfortunately the litter would never last 30 days even in the best conditions and with daily mixingThings I loved:- excellent and ingenious design of the raking system, flawless- simplicity- for the ultra model: the counter for monitoring of cat activity during the day- the perfect fit of the solid hood- the long cord- the build quality, not fragile at all unlike every Littermaid product that exists- the very quiet operation"
2,Big disapointment,"I have owned 3 Litter Maid litter boxes, and when the last one wore out, I bought this ScoopFree automatic box. I am very disappointed. Within a few months the rake stopped working. Also, it allows feces to collect behind the rake, keeping them in the box. The cartridges are just thinly plasticized cardboard, and the urine soaks through the plastic and into the cardboard. Far less than I had hoped for. I thought the use of the litter crystals was a good idea because it reduces the amount of waste created by clumping litter. Next time I will go back to Litter Maid, it is a far better designed automatic box."
2,Cat didnt like it,"I have a small but adult Himalaya cat. The box is to small for him and he refused to use it, even though I followed the manufacturer' recomendation of combining his old sand with the provided blue one. First he used it some times then he eventually stoped using it at all"
1,Defective,"Was Defective, the automatic scoop wasn't moving, I called the company for replacement, but it took a long time to ge the replacement done, plus I have to pay the shipping back. Here is the best part, the second one I received worked for about a week, and stop working again, I return the product, and purchase another one from Amazon, so I don't have to deal with the company for replacement again, It took me about 3 month to get a working product, very disappointed. If there is another company selling a similar product, I will definitely get one and throw this one away. It took more effort to get one working than to clean the box myself."
1,My cat hates ScoopFree,"I have two cats. The younger one hates the ScoopFree. I tried to transition him to ScoopFree by keeping his old litter box fully stocked and close to the ScoopFree. He gets very upset after he hears something going on in the ScoopFree. He pooped and urinated all over the condo (several over several days). After I unplugged the ScoopFree for a few days, I didn't have to deal with wiping and cleaning my carpets anymore.For my cat, ScoopFree was a horrible purchase."
1,Don't purchase until they fix the trays!,"I have owned a ScoopFree litter box for three or four years now. I have always been happy with it and the litter box itself still works fine. But don't buy this until they fix their problem with the trays!They have changed something with the litter trays recently and they get soaked through with urine and start smelling horrendous after just a few days. I used to be able to go two weeks on one tray (2 cats) and can't stand to go longer than 5 days now. The urine leaks through the cardboard and will ruin your carpet or floor underneath if you don't put something down to protect it.I complained via the ScoopFree website today. I'll update if the company responds that they are making changes, but right now don't do it! The litter box itself is great, but the tray quality will ruin your experience."
3,"It works, but there should be a better non-disposable tray option","I've found myself needing to clean cat poop out of the collection area every 3-4 days or so.It works somewhat as-advertised, but there needs to be a better non-disposable tray option. Right now, all you can do is look on auction sites and they are quite overpriced.Occasionally, the rake mechanism makes a sound like a slipping belt, but it's still working. I hope that it lasts...Also, only one of my cats has fully adjusted to the litter box. The other two have thus far continued using the old litter box even though I stopped cleaning it frequently and have been mixing in more and more crystal litter."
4,"Works, but expensive refills only last a week or two!","This works great. Doesn't last 30 days, though, especially if your cat is large or you have more than 1 cat. If you don't change the cartridge on time, it'll leak through, and I keep a large piece of plastic beneath it. It's not scoop free. I often remove the solid waste from the storage area to prolong the refill cartridge, which is expensive. Had 2, but the cost forced me to go back to 1. You can save a few dollars by dumping out the crystals before the box starts to get saturated and replacing with a new 4 lb. bag of Fresh Step Crystals. The smell of saturated crystals is awful, so don't let it get to that point."
5,Great item.,"I use the ScoopFree litterbox. Even though it doesn't last the thirty days as advertised, their customer support is EXCELLENT. You can purchase a permanent litter pan on eBay and use premium crystal litter. It'll save you some bucks. All in all ScoopFree rocks mainly because of their customer support. They deserve an award."
4,One of two cats likes it,Our other cat is afraid of it.I also think that the premise of 30 days is highly overstated. More like 2 weeks.
5,Great Product,"We did a lot of research on automatic litter boxes and decided on the scoopfree. We have been using it for about 3 weeks and no problems. We were worried that it would start to smell, but it doesn't. We can't detect any odor. Our cat seemed to take to the crystals fine. We left his old litterbox out for a while and just didn't clean it, and then took it away after 2-3 days and he has been fine. He loves to watch the cleaning cycle. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,NOT A KEEPER,"I immediately returned this item after seeing that the litter crystals are made in China AND that you can only use this brand of litter in the box. Also, I purchased the Forever Litter Tray, hoping to reduce the expense of using the company's disposable trays, but upon calling the company to verify the type of litter I could use in tray, I asked about the tray and they informed me that if I used the Forever Litter Tray, the warranty on the machine would be void. I have since ordered the Littermaid Ultimate Litter Box and could not be happier...I can use ANY clumping litter I want...my choice is World's Best Litter...made in USA."
1,ScoopFree stinky,bought it...hated it so much that we put it in the trash and went back to regular litter box - the unit does not control odors ... for the price paid we expected a far better product than received.
2,"Worked OK, but cats were too scared to keep using it","Perhaps we should have taken more time to let them get used to the box, but the noise scared them too much. After they pooped on the stairs and urinated in my husband's dirty clothes hamper, we went back to their old box and returned this. Too bad; it seems like a nice product. Maybe the key is to introduce it to cats when they are very young."
2,Scoop free self cleaning litter pan,Information did not indicate this model did not include the automatic adjustable timer on it which I wanted so I was disappointed with my purchase. Due to the large nature of this article I did not return it because of the cost of postage. My mistakefor not being sure of what I was ordering. It does work ok but 20 minutes is a long time to wait for it to rake and it does not always rake the solid waste all the way to the container. Would not purchase this brand again.
4,Awesome,"I'm a new mom and a little of a scatter brain and my cat poops a lot. This defiantly helped my stress level go down without needing to worry about cleaning the litter box every 2 days. The only thing I could see them doing to improve this device would be to make the poop tray bigger, but it also says its not for animals that pop a lot or you'll be changing the tray very often. What I did was just empty the poo and set it back down to make it last longer but even that I didnt have to do until 15 days. I love the delay rack because my cat does have frequent loose stools so this give it a chance to harden up before it racks. I my opinion this is the cheapest way to go with an automatic litter box as long as you subscribe and save the litter trays here on amazon."
2,what a gimmick,My 5 month old kitten used it for about 2 weeks until i went back to a regular litter box. Made my whole 2 bedroom apartment smell like doo doo. Cat started urinating on everything else in the apartment except where she was supposed to. Switched back to using a regular litter box and everything is perfect again. Getting rid of this $100 piece of garbage asap.
1,looks nice doesnt work after about 2 months,this product does not work after 2 months of use...i feel as i wasted my money...
5,Works Perfect,"Today is officially day 12 with 2 cats (one 11LB, one 8LB)... we are still not ready to change the tray. We were hoping for ten days we may get 14.NO SMELL, NO DUST or DUSTY FOOTPRINTS, no clogs, no waste stuck in the rake.I owned a LitterMaid about 5 years ago for 4 months... it was messy, everything smashed and smeared... the key to this one is the crystals, they dry out the waste, ridding the smell and keeping things dry. The motor works perfect EVERY time. I never have to get my hands in there to help it along.I can honestly say that this product has change my and my wife's lives... we haven't touched litter in 12 DAYS and counting..."
3,Good Product but Bad Shipping Design,"Overall great product but didn't make a good impression because:1-package was delivered and when opened, the crystals were not packaged correctly and everything spilled all over the kitchen.2-the crystals even went into the gear box and would make a disturbing grinding noise.3-there was no customer service number provided or even a seller review feedback for this purchaseIt would have been nice to get a replacement bag of crystals instead of myself having to purchase an emergency bag at the local Petco, which was not local for me (50 miles)...Overall, the product is great but would have appreciated some more responsiblity from the seller..."
2,stinky stinky box,"I bought this automated litter box when my LitterMaid Plus died. This one works great, does a great job cleaning (most of the time), but the cost of the cartiridges is too much to ask for this product. The box says that the cartridges last 2 weeks with two cats - I had to replace mine around 3 days because the stink was overwhelming! I hope others have had better experiences with this product, but mine will be returned."
3,1st week - Not so sure,"I only have one small kitten - and she started to use this box within two mins of us opening it and putting it on the floor - she loved it!Urine certainly does not smell here - which is good. But even after a couple of days the feces certainly does. The box the poop goes into is not airtight, and smells certainly seep out.We do live in a small apartment, so this certainly does have something to do with it - it's not as bad as if the smell were in a normal box...but for only one kitten, I was expecting no odor at all after reading the reviews!Will empty out the bin tonight, and try again. This is better than a normal box for the urine control - but I'm hoping the smell was just a fluke... will update after a few more weeks!"
3,This is a good product,"I was unable to get my cats to use the scoop free litter box, I tried all of the recommended ways to get them used to it and they just did not work for me. I would still recommend purchasing the scoop free litter box and trying it to see if your cat(s) will use it."
2,Great Idea...poor design,This product is a great idea but was poorly designed. Poop gets stuck on rake. It is not odor free at all. I would not recommend this product. Returning mine...
4,Would buy another!!,This product is great. The only time you need to touch it is to stir around the crystals every three or four days. It isn't as odorless as I would like but smells no where near as bad as normal kitty litter.
5,Freedom!,No more scooping. No more mess all over the floor. No odors. This auto litter box does the job. My two cats had no problem adapting to the new box. I simply threw out the old one and set up the Scoop Free. It was comical watching them puzzle over the moving rake. For my two cats one cartridge will last 10 days without getting nasty. Anything beyond that it and it pushes the nasty level. It can go beyond 10 days though. The cartridges are extremely easy to change. The bottom line is what used to be a daily ordeal has turned into barley a second thought.P.S.I recommend buying the hood.
3,Works Great but $$$$$$$$$,"Pro: works just like they say. No smell, little mess.Con: With 2 cats this barely lasts 8 days before I have to change the entire thing. If you read the other reviews you will see the same thing repeated. Even 1 cat households do not make it a month. There is only so much liquid the crystals can deal with before they stop working.This is now my vacation litter box. It is too expensive to use daily. I am going back to scooping."
2,Not worth it,I was trying to find something to make taking care of the cats easier! This isn't it. Doesn't control odor. Not everything gets pushed into the catch tray and gets pushed to the back. Messes stick to the the dragging mechanism. After three weeks and going through two trays I threw it all away. Waste of money!
3,great - but no way does it last 30 days!,"Had this box about 6 months now. The crystal little does a much better job of absorbing odor than clay or corn litter. Also does not track nearly as much. I've had very few problems with the box--though one of the teeth in the rack has broken off. Starts out as a 5-star product (light-years ahead of Littermaid). I'm subtracting one star because the litter cartridges do not come close to lasting 30 days. I have one 9lb cat and the cartridge lasts one week. Sometimes I can stretch it to 10 days, but by then my kitty is not happy and you can really smell urine! Subtracting a second star due to the maintenance costs--the refill cartridges are very expensive and it adds up to about $70 every month to maintain the box. I try to re-use each cartridge tray a couple of times with cheaper crystal litter--but this is annoying as it defeats the purpose of having such an easy box."
2,Under deliver,"This litter box is great at cleaning the box, that's about it. A cartridge with one cat only last you 2 weeks. After that things go haywire. After 2 weeks cat box made our house smell. On the 3rd week litter would pile up. Sometimes on the third week the litter would be too much and it would be pulled out of the reserve.Basically, unless you plan to spend $30 bucks a month on litter don't get it."
3,Buyers Beware,"I bought my ScoopFree on January 5, 2010. It worked great the first day, but the rake would not work the second day. I believe that it is a great product, but I will never know how great of a product. I bought the Forever Tray to try and save some money so I wouldn't have to buy the refill trays. BUYERS BEWARE: IF you use the Forever Tray with the ScoppFree it voids the warrenty since the Forever is manufactured by a 3rd party and ScoopFree ""cannot control the quality of 3rd party..."" Just an FYI if you are trying to same some cash!"
3,This box stinks,"I was so hopeful in ordering this box that it would eliminate odor from my cats litter area. Instead, my whole house smells! My cats are older and go quite a bit and this box doesn't cut it. The ammonia smell is so overwhelming after a few days that I have to change the litter. The crystals are supposed to ""absorb"" the urine but they don't. It soaks through the bottom of the cardboard tray. I am awaiting a return label from the company to send this thing back! I am going to try the Litter Robot instead."
1,"Worse then a littermaid, buy a litter robot!",I have 2 cats and this is by far the worse smelling cat box I have ever had. It also made one of my cats start pissing on the carpet. This is very expensive in the long run if you have more then 1 cat. Search for a litter robot instead. It is by far the best cat box I have ever owned and will save you a ton of money in the long run.
3,Marley's box,"My cat goes to the bathroom a lot and I mean a lot! He jumped into the crystals before I could set it up and pee'd. The box work great, but does not last for a month. I would say I should have changed it at 16 days, but cleaned out some solids and now changed it on day 20. It smells at day 20! However for me, it's worth it. I will pay extra to not have to clean the box 2 times a day and jump the whole thing every 2 days. It is worth every penny to me. I suppose some cats it might last a month, but more Marley!"
2,convenient but major odor problem,"We had been using the regular fresh step scoopable litter and it was amazing at odor control. Of course the only problem was the inconvenience of having to scoop every day so we thought we'd try this self-cleaning litter box. it's a convenient product in that you never have to clean the litter box BUT the urine smell is so awful that it outweighs the benefits. the smell is pungent after 4-5 days and having to replace the litter tray weekly (when it's supposed to last a month) can get super costly.in my opinion this is not worth purchasing especially if you're concerned about odor control, even despite the 600+ reviews. if convenience is more important than the smell issue, then this litter box is worth buying. it's a personal choice."
1,Can't Recommend,"I like the design and the function of this product. It is extremely quiet. Unfortunately, I have to agree with other reviewers who said that the box smells long before a month is up. In my case, I noticed the smell within a few days, and I replaced the cartridge. My cat hates these crystals, and the fact that she can't cover up what she does. She actually appears to be depressed,crying constantly and showing no interest in her playtime. This also happened when I previously tried switching to a very high-end automatic litter box. In that case, the design was so totally different from any litter box (and so small), I think her unhappiness was with the design. Also, the crystals scatter more than the scoopable litter.I had no odor problems with the scooping litter, and I guess I will have to give up on automatic litter boxes. Dealing with the cleaning doesn't bother me so much, but it bothers the people who ""cat sit"" when I'm away."
4,ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box,"This product works great and is much easier to maintain and clean than another manufacturer's self-cleaning litter box that I purchased about 5 years ago. It works so well, I purchased a second unit to use in another residence. My only hesitation in ordering a second unit was the price, but most self-cleaning litters are similarly priced or higher. I also purchased the ""Forever Litter Tray"" by Forever Litter Trays, Inc. to use in place of the disposable tray/litter combo that comes with the unit.Forever Litter Tray (permanent replacement for Scoop Free disposable cartridges)You'll need to purchase the crystal litter separately, but you'll be saving money by the 6th litter change. The hood is not necessary, but I was able to purchase one on sale for $1.00."
5,"Refills are a little pricey, but you DO get what you pay for these days!!","The refills are pricey, but what a better price to pay for your loved family member than this!! Even Henry Ford would smile at the design of this puppy!Absolutely no problems, buy the litter catcher mat though!!! It's painful stepping on the strewn crystals in the middle of the night!"
3,"Worked, Expensive to Maintain","It has been quite a while since I ordered this item.Just never took time to review.It seemed like a good idea. Was delivered and operated as advertised.Cats did not have trouble adapting.Easy to change, less scatter than other systems I have used.With two cats, needed to be changed more often and refills were just a little too expensive to maintain."
2,Disappointed,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I've had the box for five months. Two cats. One of my cats will go on the carpet if the litter tray is more than five or six days old. In the 5 months I've had this, I have averaged one litter tray every 12 days. That's VERY expensive. The odor is worse than my previous automatic box (from another company).I tried using clumping sand litter but it doesn't keep clean because the rake only moves horizontally, so the clumps stick to the rake and don't drop in the receptacle area.The only thing good about this unit is that it's easy to change litter.I would not recommend this unit to anyone except if you are physically unable or unwilling to ocassionally clean the litter tray in other units."
2,"Wanted to Love It, But Definitely Has Problems","I bought one of these for my 2 cats and also purchased the plastic re-usable tray, also sold on Amazon.com. The rakes work fairly well, although matter can get stuck on it and also behind it, which is annoying. Also, the rakes grab a bunch of the crystals that are new and clean and drag them back, also behind the rakes. Then you have to lift up the whole unit and pull them back into the tray, repeatedly. Also, I didn't find it suitable for 2 cats - I had to change the litter very frequently, negating the savings in cost. It seems like the litter is not deep enough, so it doesn't last very long. All in all, it wasn't worth the cost/hassle/continuous odor and we're back to regular scoopable litter, which is deep enough to bury everything and not keep us out of the laundry room!"
4,Why didn't I think about this before?,"The cats came into our family through me, so I have the responsibility of cleaning the litter boxes, which is perfectly fine since he picks up the dog poop when we go for a walk. However, when my husband and I started talking about the future such as a possible pregnancy, I reminded him that he'd have to take care of the litter during that time. That's when we thought of the automatic litter box, and wow! Why didn't I get this sooner? It's awesome! It has reduced the smell in our house by a million. Yes, it's way more expensive than a regular box to keep up with, but honestly, it was expensive buying all those air fresheners too. It's a great product. The cats got used to it right away, and it appears to work just as it is designed. If you keep it on 20 minute clean-up, the rake won't get stuck...it only gets stuck when the crystals aren't dry enough. Overall, great buy. Only bad thing is the cost of up-keep."
3,scoop free litter box,"I bought this to keep two small dogs from getting into the litter box after the cat poops. There is too much time before it works and the dogs can smell it and get into the box before it can be elimated. Otherwise I find it convenient, except for the initial order after the poop."
3,Great product but refills are expensive!!!,I have had the Scoop Free self cleaning litter box for about a week now and I love it! I have three cats and it works great! The only thing that I don't like is the price for the refill cartridges and the fact that they only last about a week. I do have three cats so the cartridges not lasting long should have been expected. I would have given this product five stars if the cartridges were not so expensive. Other than that this is a fabulous product!!!
1,Didn't work for my cats,"With two cats the litter tray lasted five days before the crystals were saturated and sticky and the whole box smelled like urine. This was very disappointing considering the advertised 10-15 days for two cats. The scooping mechanism was quiet and worked great (except some sticking/rust on the comb), however the poop tray was full and smelly in only about 3 days, so I had to scoop it out by hand. Finally after 3 months, one cat gave up on the crystal litter entirely and began urinating around the box. As soon as I went back to the clumping litter box this stopped."
4,Love it!,"I've had the box for about 3 weeks, and I love it. I have three cats and one box. Before, I had to scoop at least daily. It was a constant hassle. Now, I switch trays every 7 days with some occasionally raking throughout the week. The odor was a problem for a few days but I haven't noticed an odor the last two weeks. I did notice the last time I changed the tray, urine had soaked through the tray to a rug I had placed underneathe. This is a small problem, there definitely needs to be something absorbable under the tray. Hopefully, I will be able to buy a Forever Litter Tray soon and that will take care of the leakage. Also, finding the scoop-free litter trays has been a problem for some others, but I signed up for the subscription service through Scoop-Free and now I get the trays I need delivered every 6 weeks. I would highly recommend this box."
5,Wonderful for an apartment setting!,"I have one cat, and we had issues with the stink. Once I purchased the ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box that went away. Now I don't have to be embarrassed when friends come over. My cat also finds it amusing every time it self-cleans. I will say, she did have a hard time adjusting to the new liter box, I do recommend following their instructions on how to transition them to the new box. I don't think I can recommend this for a multi-cat home, because the refills are so expensive. However, for my situation, it is worth every penny!"
4,Much better than Littrtmaid,"ScoopFree Self-Cleaning Litter Box is very good and functions well. Compared to the new and improved Littermaid unit which I recently bought and discarded after a few weeks the ScoopFree box is fantastic. The only issue is the efficiency, storage capacity and cost of the litter trays."
4,works well!,"After reading product reviews on other automatic litter boxes, I decided to try Scoop-free. I got it mainly because I would be leaving my 4 month old kitten alone in the house for 4 days. It worked very well and I got about 20 days out of the litter cartridge. The only drawback is that although the product claims to be smell free, there are odors after a few days. The scoop-free combs the waste into a small compartment,but the odor seeps out while the wastes are dehydrating. All in all we are very pleased with the product, especially for when we go away."
5,scoop free litter box,I don't know who likes the box more. me or my cats. Two boxes two cats. You gotta love it!!!!!
4,It's Cheap But it works great,"This thing is cheaply made but it works much better than the higher priced ones. The one down side to it is the color the crystals turn after a while, which can look funky. The trays last a 20 to 30 days but the crystals turn a yellowish huh after 10 to 12 days. The crystals do keep the urine from creating the Ammonia smell which is a plus. It is ten times better than regular litter. I myself used to change the pad every 20 days. To avoid having to by the poop trays I would slip a supermarket plastic bag over it and change it daily, its simple enough.Don't be fulled by the auto-boxes that use normal litter. They are horrible and cant handle the urine.This is great for a lazy person, a little work goes a long way. The pads can be a bit pricey and changing them is a pain but for the work it saves you in the long haul its worth it. This box does a great job at keeping the stink at bay, I would say that is its best feature."
4,"works great, but refill trays are expensive","The product works great. No complaints about that.The main issue is the cost of the refill trays. I have two large cats and am barely able to go ten days with one tray. At that point, the litter crystals become saturated, and the odor of urine becomes prevalent. I'm stirring the crystals every couple days, but it's not enough. I haven't had any problems with urine leaking from the tray.Another issue is that one of my cats did not always use it for #2. He'd go on the floor next to it. The problem seems to have gone away for now; could be because I changed the scoop delay to 5 minutes rather than the default 20.I've also had the LitterMaid, and I like the ScoopFree better so far. ScoopFree is much quieter, and requires minimal cleaning. They offer a 90-day guarantee, so it's worth a try. I still have another 5 weeks to decide if the extra cost of the refill trays is worth it."
2,Expensive to maintain,"I have 2 cats and the ScoopFree trays only last about 4 days. At $15.00 per refill that gets pretty expensive. If you try to stretch their use, they get really nasty and unbearable."
2,It Stinks!,"I have two 13-pound male cats, and the box with the hood is large enough to accomodate them. They started using it right away, along with their other litter boxes in the house. The mechanics of the machine worked nicely, turning on around twenty-minutes after the cat had left the box.Unfortunately, I was sold on the line that this box was odor free. It is not odor free! After two days it stunk worse than their other litter boxes. Poop got stuck in the metal wire scappers, and it filled the small box at the bottom of the machine in less than a week. There is no odor control in the bottom box, poop just sits in there stinking until it drys completely. Needless to say, this box is heading out to the trash."
3,My cats don't like it,"I was very excited about this product, having 2 cats and not wanting to clean out the litter box daily. The concept is great...but my cats apparently don't like it. I did give them a transition period where I mixed the crystals with their old clumping litter. They will only pee in it. Then they poop in front of the box. I ended up putting back the regular box right next to it with the clumping litter and they really prefer that one.Also, I don't think it absorbs the odor at all. I still have to change the litter one a week, with urine only, or my whole basement reeks. They still pee in the other box too. I can't imagine what it would smell like if they only used the Scoop Free box.If my cats actually used it I'd probably give it 4 stars, just for ease of use. But as is, 3 at most. I wish I'd returned it during the 90 day guarantee rather than taking the ""wait and see"" approach, where I'm ready to toss it after 6 months."
2,It Stinks,I have one 3 lb. kitten.The box and hood are great and the kitten likes the litter. But do not be fooled.....It doesn't handle odor the way other litter does! I still scoop everyday from under the cardboard lip.Before my Scoopfree came i was using a disposable box w/ litter (Cats Pride) Far superior litter! I will not be buying anymore replacement cartridges. I will use a permanent cartridge and fill w/ own litter. A waste of money!
2,Not so great for me....,I bought this system after my aunt RAVED about this system. I saw and smelt it after over a month of use and there was no smell and the liter looked new! I shelled out the money for my two cats and... a day went by and the house REEKED. I have to take out the poop everyday so that my house doesn't smell and I've had it for over 4 months and the automatic rake gets stuck!I've just reverted back to scooping and using clumping litter b/c it is easier to manage for me!
4,"Works very well, but is getting more expensive to continue","When I got my first indoor-only cat, I knew I'd probably need to get an automated litter box due to my anticipated forgetfulness about scooping. I read all the reviews and this one was pretty universally recommended compared to the others available on the market. I've been using it for about 10 months since I first adopted a former stray through the shelter. He took to it right away without any problems. Whenever it goes through its cleaning cycle, he tries to attack the metal sweeper, but it has stood up well to his abuse. I have to change out the cartridges approximately every 3 weeks. I've been very happy with it. It does a good job with odor and is pretty quiet too.With all of the praise I have for the box, it's a little disappointing that the price of the replacement cartridges has continued to rise. It doesn't seem that they should be as expensive as they are, and shouldn't prices go down over time as production increases?"
2,at first this was great...so i thought.....,"I thought this was a great product at first. It claims that with two cats, you don't have to change the litter until every two weeks. That is a lie. You have to change it every week and the refills get very expensive for it. I'm getting rid of this asap!"
4,I waited to give my review..,"I wanted to wait to give my review to make sure my cats liked it. It took some changing around in the house as to where it was going to get used. If the old kitties could they would use the old boxes the younger kitties adapted quicker. We have 6 cats now and the clay litter would get stinky fast. After about 3 moves I think I have figured out the good places for these boxes. I bought two and I have two old boxes, they are beginning to use the Scoop Free much more than in the beginning, they seem to use it more for urinating than pooing, but that's okay because sometimes the rake does get stuck with poo, but most of the time its fine. I'm pleased with this product and I did purchase it with the addition of two kitties and its helping with all the cats we have."
3,good but had to revise,We have two cats and I thought this would be a great gift for my husband who cleans the box. The problem was that our 1 of our cats poops too much. The catridge and cover that lifts up was too small after 2/3 days and did no close down all the way so the group of waste smelled foul.My husband mounted the litter box on a wood box he made and cut out the underneath of the cartridge where the waste gathers. Now the rake drags the waste down and drops it into a bag that he can change as often as needed. The cartridges work good for a week absorbing the urine (we also add more reg kitty litter) and the rake and sensor work really well for keeping up with the 2 cats schedule. Hope that helps in your decision.
2,Wet and smelly!,"While the mechanism seemed to work fairly well, the granules did not adequately absorb the liquid or the smell. The cartridge is supposed to last a month, but it was soaking through to our floor after less than 3 weeks. Sorry, but I just don't think this one lives up to it's claims. Or maybe our cat just pees way too much!"
3,Doesn't hold enough poo!,"I setup the scoop free on June 27. It's now July 10 and I've had to remove the poo from the holder about 3 times now. I have ONE nine pound cat. Maybe she poops excessively, I don't know, but it's not scoopfree (or stink free for that matter). However, I have it set up in the basement, so it's better than nothing (especially since the cat box isn't always in my face). I mostly like the fact that it gets my cat's poos out of her way and stirs up the pee (makes the litter last longer)."
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,I just can't say anything good about this. It is overpriced. It doesn't work. It is loud. It gets filthy within a week with feces that collect on the blades that are supposed to push the debris into the back of the unit. Do not buy this. You are wasting your money.
2,"Oh, but cha gotta buy a tray... that's how they getcha ;P",seems counter-productive in my opinion to be stuck with buying trays. bagging methods with any store bought clumping litter seem like they might be more economical and convenient in purchase.
3,Poop in rake,"We have two cats and bought the Scoop Free litter box. The rake ALWAYS gets poop caught in it and then it smells terrible. The poop is never scooped away, it remains on the rake. It is really groce. I wish I had a solution, but it looks like we are going to go back the the old fashion box. We just can't stand the smell."
1,no happy with amazon!~,THEY DOUBLED MY ORDER AND CHARGED ME TWICE. I CONTACTED THEM IMMEDIATLY AND ASKED THEM NOT TO SEND TWO. THEY DID IT ANYWAY! WHAT WAS THE POINT OF EMAILING THEM. NOW I HAVE TO PAY 16.00 TO SEND THIS STUPID THING BACK!
1,"Expensive to upkeep, does not last very long","I have owned this litter box for a few months now. I have 2 cats at home which use this litter box. One refill scoopfree box with crystals only lasts about 5 days before it is full and should be replaced. The manufacturers instructions say it should last 15 days with 2 cats. The refills are costly at $20 each, and even with mixing in scoopable cat litter it is not enough. I wish I could return it, it is very expensive and does nothing to help hide the smell like the old covered one would do."
1,Noisy,"On the front of the box, along with all the other great Scoop Free attributes, are the words ""whisper quiet motor."" Well, the motor itself may be that quiet, but the rest of the moving parts make enough noise to wake the dead.When the rake moves back and forth in its track, it's quite noisy. But what's even worse, as the rake moves, it twice changes its angle by flipping in its track. As it does so, it makes a VERY loud clunk. Maybe if you live in a house and stick the litter box in the basement, that's fine. But if you're in a one bedroom apartment, there is no avoiding that sound in the middle of the night.Secondly, the instructions tell you to place the Scoop Free unit near the old litter box until your cat(s) become acclimated to it. Given its large footprint, however, that may not be practical. Also, many people keep their litter boxes in the bathroom; in its instructions, the Scoop Free recommends against that because of the humidity."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT,"This is the worst item on the market. It seems like it would be totally great. Maybe for kitty poopies, but for urine, it smells. It smells the whole house! And, I only own one cat. When I bought the product, I thought I would save money by purchasing a subscription to kitty litter refills through scoop free. Today, when I realized that this product was never going to work, I called to cancel my subscription. THEY CHARGED ME $20 TO CANCEL A SUBSCRIPTION. And, the customer service representative was rude about it.Just don't do it!"
1,"Works flawlessly, stinks to high heaven","Mechanically works great -- have never had a jam in about 3 months of use. The cats took to it easily. Easy to change refills although they are a bit expensive. Best to buy in bulk from the web.However, if you have a small enclosed space to place this product (like we do), my simple recommendation is, ""don't"". This litter box STINKS! We have 2 cats and change the refills (so new litter) every two weeks. No matter what we do, our house smells like a litter box. We're in the process of a) changing to a new type of litter box, or b) getting rid of the cats. Either way, we're getting rid of this litter box! The smell is that bad."
1,Money pit!,"Cardboard cartridge physically cannot hold liquid for more than a few days. Once it is soaked with you-know-what, the smell is very strong and it is very hard to dispose of the tray as it is falling apart. Not to mention that if you put it directly on the floor, the floor would be ruined. You need to buy the device, a bunch of cartridges, a floor mat and a mask to cover your nose!"
1,Don't Buy It!,"This is a terrible product that both you and your cat will hate. They claim that you will only need to change the litter box once a month but that claim is 100% false and they know it. Checkout their website where you will see that they offer standing monthly orders of four packs or six packs of the cartridges. If each cartridge lasts a month why would anyone need four or six a month? They barely last three days and at the end of the three days your cat's paws will be soaking when he/she steps out, your house will smell, and you will realize that you have been ripped off."
2,My cat hated it!,In theory this product would be great. My cat hated it. I tried all the tricks in the manual but my cat did not like the feel of the crystals. Only get this product if your cat is not picky
5,Great!,"In the past had the Litter Maid brand; always had problems. This litter box had worked efficiently from the beginning. There was no need to meld the litter from the old box to this new one. Our cat went immediately to the new ScoopFree box when we threw out the old, standard litter box. We have noticed that this box is much cleaner. Also enjoying the ""visit"" counter."
4,Good but $$$,"I have to start out by saying I can't imagine going back to a traditional litter box. However, the cost of this box is pricey, then I purchased the hood separately and would highly recommend getting that as well. But, the disposable trays are also pricey. It is recommended to change the trays every 30 days, they cost about $20 and I can only find them at PetCo, not PetsMart. I've had this box for 2 years and keep the tray in longer, but will change all the litter out of it to make the tray last longer. Also, I think the mechanism needs to be oiled or something, because will make a horrible squeaking noise."
4,Easy,This product is very easy to maintain. The cost of the trays is expensive but it works well. Our cat just watches it clean itself and he had no problem using it. Great invention! for us ours is a kitten 5 months old and we had to change it after 2.5 almost 3 weeks of use. need to look at other options for the replacement tray to cut some dollars. but love what it does.. NO MESS
3,Large Litter Box,Recently bought this litter box for my cat and I like it but think its a bit on the large side. Also I when the rake sweeps the poop into the privacy hood sometimes poop gets stuck on the rake and clumps up. nice litter box very nice to have if you have a large enough bathroom space to keep it.
2,Worked at first but FAILED in the end.,"Even after multiple cleanings and even trying to oil the rakes, poop keeps sticking and molding with the rake. Which looks gross, smells terrible and defeats the entire purpose of the system. ScoopFree needs to create a better rake, or make the rake replaceable, or make sleeves for the rake. As of right now, the way the product is made fails at cleaning poop and eliminating odor. Which are the two main reasons for buying the product. I am so sick of having to take apart the box and clean it, that I am getting rid of it after about 6 months of use.Good idea but BAD implementation!"
5,GREAT STUFF,"EASY TO USE, EASY TO CLEAN. ALONG WITH THE CRYSTAL LITTER I ONLY TOUCH THE LITTER BOX ONCE A WEEK, FOR TWO CATS."
4,Great!,"After doing the research and reading all of the reviews, we selected this litter box and have been very happy. It is a little louder than I anticipated, but nothing significant (unless you expect dead silence). It took almost two weeks for my cat to stop running over and staring when it would go through the cleaning cycle...I think he was just protective? I would give it a 5 were it not for the cost of the litter refills."
1,Money Pit and Nasty,"I've never been inspired to write a review before this, but just had to speak up. I bought this because changing regular litter triggers asthma attacks for me. Seemed like the crystals would be a great idea. NOT.We have one cat. Granted, he's a bit large, and he's senior, so he probably ""outputs"" a little than the average feline. But he's normal and healthy.Each tray lasts about 5 days with our one cat. Then the crystals are saturated, the bottom of the tray is swimming, the house stinks and the cat starts to pee on the floor. Stirring the litter does not help. It is not stuck behind the rake. It is not getting scooped into the poop area.Removing the old tray is NASTY - smells like, well an old puddle of pee and the contents is just about sloshing. Ewwww. The smell is about enough to trigger an asthma attack just on pure yuck factor.5 days. $15 per tray. Nasty outcome. Recommend spending money elsewhere."
4,Great Litter Box!,"I love this litter box. When we moved recently my two cats were forced to stay inside for a week and weren't used to having a litter box, but they took to this immediately. I have stirred it on occasion and have manually emptied the hard waste to extend the life, but it's been three weeks with two cats and we are still on the first cartridge. I'll admit, though, that it's time to change.I've tried every automatic litter box that's out there, but this one is the only one I've kept. The others were more work than hand scooping, but this is like a miracle. Since the refills are so expensive, I've decided to try PermaScoop, a permanent litter box made to fit scoop free. It will save big money in the long run."
5,Great Product,"This litterbox works as advertised. Newer refill cartridges now have a liquid-resistant liner, so the bottoms never get soaked like the old ones used to.After owning ours for a while, the sensor started getting more and more dependent upon bright light in order to operate properly. It got to the point where the sensor light would always blink rapidly as if the sensor was obstructed unless the room was brightly lit. The problem was solved by using a can of compressed air to blow into the two holes on the interior side walls of the litterbox; that's where the sensors are. The compressed air blew away whatever the obstruction was, and the litterbox once again operates smoothly even in a pitch-black room."
4,Back in the Day,"One chance to win takes you back to the truly golden era of American motocross and stands as a great snapshot of the moment that America began to dominate motocross globally. Still, to see these ""factory stars"" truly sweating it out between motos and the most luxurious riders pitting out of box vans, takes one back to simpler times. To see Jimmy Weinert pouring water over himself out of an oil pan just shows you how far the sport has come in the 30+ years since this film was shot. The race footage is good, but it is the behind the scenes footage that really gives the movie it's soul... and should be required viewing for any up and coming motocrosser in this day and age."
2,One Chance to win,"Buying and getting the DVD was easy and fast from the Seller. The One Chance To Win DVD in it's self was ""Lame""! I was expecting a lot more serious racing action, rather than interviews about a bunch of riders. At best I would give this movie a ""2"" for some information I didn't know about. Other than that, it was a total and complete waste of money! ! ! !"
5,A Shooks,Love my glasses too bad they discontinued this style. I would love another pair. Can never go wrong with this brand.
1,junk,"The blades jam constantly, the handle is awkward, and it's about as noisy as a jackhammer. My kids hate the sound so much, they beg me to stop. Also the blades are so thick that the liquid/batter barely goes through the thing. My husband just whipped up some cream, and said, ""Well, there is one advantage. It's so hard to crank, I can cancel my gym membership."" Just an awful tool. Total junk."
4,Turn the crank the other way!,I wasn't so sure about this egg beater because on my first attempts it was kind of sticky and would stall after several cranks...ugh! BUT...I tried cranking it the other direction and it works wonderfully. Hurrah! Maybe that's the secret to make this remarkable little kitchen tool actually work....crank it the other direction! If it starts to fail after I use it a while I'll let you know.
3,Who's reading this anyway?,"As with the other reviewers, i find there is good content in this book. I need good well thought out reading material to present to anger management classes. Many of the people I see are court referred. Saw this book as a ""Source Book!"" abd it is. It is OK for me to read, but many of my clients would become lost in the language. It may be a better text for executive training, or military leaders, but becomes encumbered in ""big words."" I've lost audiences before with language that has no meaning to the reciever. It would be much better if written for the ""average joe."""
2,Not the best,"I received and started using this product today. The two things I don't like immediately are: the very strong odor it emits even after several hours out of the box (and the ensuing headache) and the foam is very stiff (not giving/ cushy at all). The pads of my hands sit on top and barely make an indentation despite how long it sits. The one feature I like is the adjustable height on the base (basically you flip it over for taller or shorter), but the base is also too wide measuring the shorter width to comfortably place hands properly. This product is going back to the store."
4,Solid Espanglish!!,"Yo, when I first heard this album, I was excited. My favorite songs in english redone en espanol. If your into latin music and rap your gonna like the new verisons more the original hits. Theres some spanish reggae and mariachi beats that are hot when rapped to by a boricua. The CD is one that you will want to bump in your jeep. My whole family and all my friends loved it!! I still haven't seen it since i lent it out."
4,Awesome overall.,"Tommy Stubbs's illustrations are beautiful and friendly-looking; the book is of great quality, with a cloth binding and nice paper. The details (like a visit from an owl) are cool and fun to talk about with my almost-two-year-old. My only problem with this book is that Thomas sneaks out past his bedtime without telling anyone but a sleepy [and irresponsible] Gordon. I'm not saying kids will imitate Thomas, necessarily, but if my son had insomnia I'd rather he read a book than sneaked out of the house! Of course, it wouldn't be easy for a train to read a book, so I don't know what I'm suggesting for the storyline in Thomas and the Shooting Star, but it does bother me just a little that Thomas slips out on his own.My son really enjoys reading the book, though, and he'll ask us to read it several times in the same day. It's definitely a fun story."
4,A delightful book,I purchased this book for my two year old granddaughter who has fallen 'in love' with the Thomas trains. She likes the brightness of the pages and the story as grandma reads it. I would recommend it to add to one's library for children's books.
3,Still Looking For the Perfect Feeder,"One of these days I'll find the perfect feeder. This one is not it. Having many type feeders in the yard, I thought I'd add one more platform style to appease cardinals. Almost two months later and still not one cardinal has used it. Mind you, I have a yard full of cardinals, but they don't go near that feeder. Squirrels can and do, although there is a limit as to just how much seed they can extract. Little birds use it too, but they use every other type feeder in the yard as well, and they weren't the reason I bought another feeder in the first place. So, both my reasons, to satisfy cardinals and keep out squirrels, failed. I wish I had never bought this expensive and hard to clean feeder. Update: I've now had this feeder almost eight months and still no cardinal usage. As a matter of fact, this feeder is used the least (by any birds) of the seven hanging around the yard."
2,Smart Squirrels,"Well, this is a beautiful feeder, but the squirrels in my neighborhood were smart enough to figure out how to get in it."
2,Birds can't get at the seeds,This feeder seems like a great idea but it doesn't work. The feature that makes the seed difficult for the squirrels to get at also makes it difficult for the birds. They can't get to the seed. I don't know why other reviewers have not mentioned this problem.
2,So simple yet so Difficult!,"I ordered this feeder to have one with a roof to help keep the seed dry. I like platform feeders for allowing full view of the birds. Just wish the roof was clear plastic which would make viewing easier and without casting a shadow. Now for the nightmare. Never has such a simple design turned into a nightmare to assemble for me. First, I had to drill out one of the roof rod supports in order for it to fit. Then when it came time to fit the four rods to the roof the rods weren't 90 degrees to the platform! Surely we could make these in the USA instead of China for a similar cost! Oh and one more thing, when I called Duncraft for assistance and to complain they weren't interested in helping me since I purchased at Amazon............"
2,more information,Cant see if the cushions covers back and seat of chair or just the seat. Also what size is it?
1,Dumbest book I ever read,"This book is just a stupid rant and has no struture or logic behind it, waste of time, there is no good advice and it just made me more confused."
2,Just not a very good read....,I am buying these Paizo releases out of curiosity. I am just not very impressed with the Henry Kuttner offering. Elak and Prince Raynor are both very bland characters and the stories just fell flat and were uninteresting.
3,Elak - at last!,I'd first read about about Elak of Atlantis in an anthology by Lin Carter about 30 years ago & thank Amazon for making it possible for me to finally find the full anthology of Elak + the 2 (the only 2?) Prince Raynor stories...I agree with other reviews that the Prince Raynor stories are the best written. Its an anthology worth having if you enjoy Fritz Leiber & Robert E Howard...entertaining & easy reading...
3,Great bag until it broke,I loved this bag until the main zipper broke and couldn't be fixed. The bag lasted about 2 years.
2,Great Backpack for Laptop,"After searching far and wide for a backpack that would easily accomodate my 17"" screen laptop, I purchased the Targus. It is roomy, sturdy, and fits much more than just the computer. It was a great buy.Update: Thirteen months of use (although not extraordinary wear and tear) have taken a toll on this backpack. I recently noticed that the outside left shoulder seam is coming apart/fraying. After paying this much for a bag, I'd expect more and am disappointed."
5,Redemption After Horrible T3!,"great continuation of the Terminator saga.. Salvation should of came right after T2-JD, but at least we have it now! love it, love it!!"
2,Weak.,"If you love the Terminator franchise...well, you'd HAVE to love it to endure this mess. The first two flicks were awesome, of course. The third? Not so much. T4? The downward spiral continues. Huge budget, talented actors and great story material are all majestically pissed away. The Charlie's Angels films were light and fun but McG needed to introduce a bunch of peripheral characters that would have been fine in another film but who cares? I didn't and that was the problem. Bryce Howard gets to walk around with big eyes. Christian Bale gets to play in some over-the-top effects sequences. Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood(sp?) get to have a romance and why do we need this or care? All of these people are extremely talented and again, the effects? More or less spectacular. But I found myself apathetic. In the earlier films you found a stake in the characters and cared. With T4 I felt like I was watching a play by Max Fisher. Well done but just not the real deal."
1,I terminated it at 32:31.,"What's going on? Why should I care about these characters? Then I found myself asking why I even care how it ends. Seriously, try to see this movie without any additional incremental out-of-pocket expenses before you plunk down real money and take up valuable DVD shelf space."
2,Why does McG keep getting work?,"Well this is a crying shame. I love Terminator and T2. McG wanted James Cameron's blessing on this film and , proving he is no dummy, Cameron did not give it to him. Smart man. McG came from music videos and it shows. In his own furiously fast fashion this is a love letter to Cameron. There are iconic lines, a weird looking Arnie, Linda Hamilton's voice (sorta), and the actors do what they can with the material; calling it cheesy dialog is an insult to cheese.This isn't Christian Bale's movie, it's Sam Worthington's and he does a fabulous job. Bale is his usual intense self playing a soldier trying to survive and be a leader and a husband without losing his mind.The directing is terrible. Worse than terrible. This isn't ""Batman and Robin"" or anything, but if you saw the trailer/preview, you saw the movie. And that is a tragedy. Cameron created a series with meat; McG serves you a packaged salad without dressing and expects you to be happy about it."
4,Not the best,"The Terminator story line is getting a little long in the tooth. But, if you bought in from the beginning you have to see this latest edition. It could be done so much better, but at least we see the story progress...or regress as the case may be. Any ""Terminator"" fan has to see this one as well."
3,James Cameron For T5?,"I was expecting great things after Christian Bales apparent lack of enthusiasm for T3. Unfortunately for him Terminator 3 Rise of The Machines is far superior to Salvation on every level, better storyline, characters, and much better climax to T4, which is really too derivative of T2's final set piece.The problem with T4 is that it has no real story to it that you can speak of,quite frankly it's a mess. Sam Worthington is totally miscast, and seems boredthroughout the whole movie. As for Christian Bale it's a case of now you see him, now you don't.On the plus side it is full of special effects that fans will love. Ironically the gas station sequence and the subsequent chase scene following it, is the movie's saving grace. It's truly superb and is one of the best set pieces I have seen in any of the Terminator movies. I have not seen the Directors Cut but I am sure it has to be better than this."
2,A complete letdown,"I didn't necessarily have high hopes for this film, but I didn't shun it at first sight either. It had rather strong casting, and with Christian Bale in it, I figured it could be very surprisingly good, since about every film he is in gets rather good reviews by critics, but I am afraid this one was a miss fire by Bale. Throughout the movie, you can almost see it in his eyes, that he knows how horrible the movie is. By the way he communicates with everyone in the movie, you can almost hear him saying, ""Why the heck am I in this film? The plot is extremely linear and boring, the script is very poorly written and is even more poorly executed by the actors, and why is my character suppose to be such a wimp? I'm John Connor! I am suppose to be the last bad-A left in this God-forsaken war, yet I act like I am a pre-pubescent teenager!"" I believe these realizations are the cause of his notorious fiasco on the set of Terminator Salvation."
1,what a waste,"the trailer for T:salvation was perhaps one of the better trailers I'd seen in along time. Despite the fact that McG was directing, my expectations were high. But man was the movie disappointing. Sure the special effects were great, which is a credit to the animators and the budget for FX, but everything else was just terrible. The story was WEAK, the acting mediocre, the editing choppy and all the fun of the previous terminator movies was completely missing. It was an overserious bore."
1,Didn't get it...,"I can't review this transaction because I never got the movie. I thought that maybe things were backlogged around Christmas, but it's February...and still no movie."
1,"Great movie, Great price",Bought this movie as a Christmas present at a great price. Saving on each present means more presents for the folks on my list. Thank you Amazon for helping me out.
1,GOD This movie SUCKED,"This film was atrociously bad. I wouldn't watch it again if it was running free on network TV, much less buy a copy of it. It was pathetic in all aspects..."
2,Looks good less filling,"I had high hopes for this film. I have to say it failed on almost all levels. I gave it 2 stars because it does look good. However that was it. The plot was dreadful the script even worse. If you have to watch it how many times do they yell ""hang on"" it is like a drinking game with Keanu Reeves. I like Bale and was suprised at how little they gave him. And what was with the child who did not speak. What a blatant Hollywood ploy to try and create some emotion, just awful. Wait for cable for this one as you will not be happy if you own it."
3,Last of the series?,"The first two of the Terminator series were the best movies, #3 was a mess and this, very expensively produced, one- finally the last in the series?- was one that left me wanting something, not quite sure what (James Cameron's hand at the wheel maybe). ""Rise of the Machines"", #3, left such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't bother ordering this one until I saw it at a bargain bin price, being a 2 disc director's cut with all of the extras the DVD never offered- this one should finally be worth my money."
2,Man and machine battle for the control of destroyed Earth,"Earth is destroyed except for a few people and the machines. John Connor gives Resistance radio pep-talks with all the inspiration of an annual tax form. Death-row guy discovers that Skynet made him an infiltration Terminator and he screams, ""Noooooo!"" Lots of fighting. Stuff blows up. Machines buzz. Connor always escapes as the lone survivor of man-machine slaughtering while death-row infiltration Terminator keeps on fighting to save the day. Neither man nor machine is deserving of victory and there's no prize for the winner. It's just two hours of stuff grinding together."
2,Continuity? I can't find it here.,"I'll start out by saying that I love The Terminator franchise, concepts, and basically the universe of ideas that Cameron spawned within his mind a long time ago. However, I must say that there were only two things that stopped this review from getting one star rather than two. One being that Christian Bale was in this movie, as he is one of my favorite actors, however is performance here was lacking. The second would be the special effects which were very well done. The rest of the movie though basically sucks, as did T3. The rest of the cast sucks, even B.D. Howard, and they give a third rate performance. And the plot? Don't get me started. Where is the continuity here? Fox's ""The Sarah Connors Chronicles"" keeps continuity more in line, stemming from T2. T3 sucked so bad that it doesn't even count. Thank God for special effects and Bale, or this film could have been T3 part two. We can always think...what could have been.Peace and Love,Jake"
3,All right...,"Don't get me wrong - this movie isn't terrible. Special effects are good, and the storyline is actually interesting and considerably more engaging than the one found in Terminator 3.But it feels like they're just in it for the money. John Connor meets his (teenaged) father in this film (before Daddy time traveled to the past to help Sarah Connor) and while this was a interesting twist, I felt it was a rather unneccessary story to be told. The part with the cyborg/former prisoner was more interesting, though, and it gives Skynet some more dimensionality than in previous films.All in all, a decent thriller like the third, just don't hold HIGH expectations and you'll probably enjoy it."
3,WEAKEST OF ALL TERMINATOR FILMS,"Terminator Salvation is the weakest of all the Terminator films, with one exception: Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright - he is terrific. He's even better in Avatar. And this year, he stars in Clash Of The Titans. Something to anticipate. Besides Wright, the film is pretty much just a lot of noise and special effects that don't add up to much. Even Christian Bale is the weakest I've seen him. It's almost as if he knows Wright is stealing the film away from him, and there's nothing he can do about it.Waitsel Smith"
4,Good action movie for Terminator fans,"I've never been a Terminator fan maybe because I'm not an Arnold fan. I like Christian Bale since he played American Psycho. Therefore, I liked this movie. Simple as that. But if you're a huge fan of the series Terminator then indulge in owning a copy of Terminator Salvation."
4,Good Re-visit To The Past...,Terminator Salvation is a good re-visit to the past. Good but not great. A GREAT re-visit to a bonafide franchise is Die Hard 4. Director Len Wiseman understood the material and seamlessly generated an explosive next chapter. This is where Terminator Salvation falls short. It borrowed too generously from the past and relied too heavily on editing to make it nothing more than a better than o.k. sequel. Worth a watch but a missed opportunity for sequel greatness.
3,Terminate This!,"Terminator Salvation is the fourth in the Terminator series. It's also the lesser of the four. The first three starred Ah-Nuld, and were great because of him. Terminator Salvation stars Christian Bale and is slightly above average in spite of him. The action is good, the Terminators are great (including that one that looks identical to Arnold S. circa 1984), but the story isn't. They just don't make action movies the way they used to, when they not only had good action, but they also had something to entertain you even when something wasn't blowing up. When nothing is being shot or blown up onscreen, Terminator: Salvation is pretty boring. Still, I'd take Terminator: Salvation over Transformers, Iron Man 2, and G.I. Joe."
5,A lot action,Very good movie a lot action from beggining to end.Me gusto mucho la history sigue a la primera Terminator .
4,Much better than I thought it would be,"I had very poor expectations of this movie, especially since the last Terminator movie was so terrible. I was completely suprised and totally enjoyed this movie."
4,Minus the psycho,"Minus the psychotic issues Christian Bale had on the set (just another angry psycho Australian at it again, first Mel Gibson then Bale), this is a good movie."
4,Actually a good action movie saved by the actors playing in it,"Terminator Salvation is a good action movie with pretty good plotline follow by a good acting job by Bale and Worthington. The Terminator series seems to be streaching the limits at times but still keeping people's intrest in the series with acting of the actors, the music, and the basic plotline. If you like the basic idea of the Terminator series and a good action movie with pretty good fight scenes, action, and drama that makes you feel for the characters then this is the movie for you to enjoy. Over the past few years I've watched it mutiple times and still I enjoy it. As for myself it keep me intrested all the way threw from start to finish, I do hope they actually go threw with their idea for Terminator 5 sometime in the future."
4,John Connor Blah - Marcus Wright AWESOME,"John Connor Blah - Marcus Wright AWESOMEDidn't like the John Connor character at all. Nothing special. But Marcus Wright - the machine/man - he was incredible. He was the real star of the film. Like seriously he was. It felt like it couldn't possibly be any other way than that he was the star. And he was incredible - just a truly wonderful character. The movie was ok, but the character of Marcus Wright was one of the best characters ever. I also like Moon Bloodgood and her character, though they weren't nearly as good as Marcus Wright."
2,What where they Thinking?!,"This movie was sub-par. It was just called Terminator to sell tickets. I didn't enjoy more than half of this movie. It was OK. But the other three where so much better. For those of you who scoffed at T3, I think after you saw this one you where probably more grateful for T3 than you had been. Let's hope, since they did take in a little bit of a profit, if you factor in the worldwide total, let's hope the next one is better. Let's hope they get better writers and a better director and a better soundtrack. I'd hate to see the Terminator franchise meet its own Judgement Day."
2,Pointless,"Nothing new happens in this movie. It has plenty of action, mostly in the form of explosions, but nothing in the movie actually moves the Terminator story line forward. The viewer goes out where he came in.Equally frustrating is that the movie insults the viewer's intelligence with lazy plot devices. For example, there are scenes involving the movement of massive, clanking machines, yet characters aren't even aware of the machines until the machines are on top of them. Or consider that barrels of oil or gasoline, or tubes of molten metal or liquid nitrogen are conveniently ubiquitous so characters can shoot them when needed to make an explosion or melt some machine.The movie is riddled with such devices. They play out, one after another, for about two hours. Nothing else happens. We learn nothing new.My recommendation is to skip this awful addition to the T series."
2,"Decent film, terrible DVD","I thought Salvation was decent, and I was definitely considering purchasing it when it arrives on DVD...well, not anymore. The DVD version is only coming with the theatrical cut while the Blu-ray is coming with that AND the director's cut. Why? DVD is far from being a dead format. I know the studios and such are trying to promote Blu-ray and whatnot, but there are plenty of other ways to do this. Until the director's cut is available on DVD, no purchase from me."
3,Not the story I expected!!,"I watched this movie, expecting a better storyline. There was less story and more special effects though. To me a movie is always a let down when that happens. I won't spoil it for you by telling you anything specifically in the movie. I will say that you can watch this without seeing any of the other terminator movies or The Sarah Connor Chronicles series and you will be able to follow with no problem. All in all I gave it 3 stars. Then again my views might also have been affected by my physical condition while watching the movie, as I have recently injured my back, and been laid up for over a week. Anyway, the movie is a great form of escapism, the action is almost non-stop as is the case with most terminator movies. I just wish there had been more to the storyline. It felt too gappy.Rod"
3,Movie review,I guess I expected more from this movie after all the terminator series I've watched. I just wasn't that impressed with it. As always though there was great service from Amazon.
4,"""Win or lose, this war ends tonight!""","Way to many people are trashing this movie for no good reason. This is a fine addition to the Terminator storyline. Set in the future after ""Judgment Day"" it follows John Connor leading the resistance. The movie is well written and well acted (Worthington has serious potential) and throws you the occassional curveball to keep you interested. The action is well done and cgi compliments it! A must see for anyone who is a fan of the franchise. If this is your first exposure to it, you will find yourself looking for the other three movies a.s.a.p.MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful print with some eye popping sequences. Demo Disc potential. FINAL VERDICT: A MUST OWN."
5,great movie,"a great addition to the terminator line of movies.If you havent seen it yet,you will see some new terminators.Action packed"
3,Not as expected,"I did some research on this particular episode & like the most common with the critics, it is not a good portrayal of the life after. It falls short of what one would expect after seeing all the others."
4,okay,"A different take from the original trilogy of Terminator films, does have a good cameo of ""Ahnold"" in it and gives props to the CGI industry."
4,Good action movie,"Terminator Salvation is a good action movie, continues the Terminator saga. Don't go in expecting it to make a lot of sense though. Just sit back, watch and enjoy. And as usual in this series, the Terminator is by far the best character and the one you root for."
2,"Half-reboot, half-sequel, all-terrible","The Bottom Line:Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.2/4"
3,Ok,"Movie does well on its own. The sound on the blu ray is some of the best I've heard, Transformers1-2, Dark Knight, Iron Man, the picture is great but the movie looks a bit drab, it's meant to look like this I assume. The director's cut is the best way to watch the movie as the original has some poor editing. Kyle Reese is played well but I did not care for Moon Bloodgood. Good not Amazing."
3,Another Terminator Movie,"The theme hadn't changed much. Man fighting against sentient machines in a post apocalyptic landscape. And of course it being a prequel you kinda know whats gonna happen it is just the manner in which everything plays out. The surprise here is the origin of the Terminator sent to rub out John Conner, the rest is really eye candy and special effects. So if you are looking for some good CGI which a not-to-complicated plot/story and are a fan of the Terminator Franchise, this one is for you!"
1,A Struggling Series.,"T2 is by far one of the greatest action flicks ever made - it's layered with modern themes, awesome action, and inspired performances from Hamilton, Furlong, and Morton. Cameron is a jerk, but his directing is intense - we rarely see such daring REAL stunt work anymore.Outside of that, Terminator: Salvation stacks yet another mediocre attempt against an otherwise compelling idea. The effects are first class, there are some decent action sequences (well choreographed) but they can't save the plot which is held together with sheep hairs. If you're a fan, you'll find yourself going, ""what?"" and ""I knew it!"" alternately through the film. But you'll also say ""that was cool"" a few times, too. Just don't expect another T2... it's hard to outshine such brilliance, and the Terminator series struggles to meet the bar of regular film offerings with every installment."
2,action ad nauseum,"The movie was well made with action, action, and then more action.I couldn't really find a plot or figure out just exactly who the goodguys were until nearly the end of the movie. Teenagers will love it.Adults will probably get bored, like I did"
3,The definition of bittersweet,"I purchased this product thinking it would be some excellent version and not disappoint. Was great in terms of quality and sound, but the major gripe I had with this was that though it was shot in 16:9, the actual picture size was far less and compensated for the balance using black bars. To make it worse, the black bars were of a different contrast to the standard filler area that is seen on 16:10 displays. Well, it was a good watch with 3 discs and I like the movie, so I'll give it 3 stars instead of 2. Bittersweet purchase."
2,POORLY LIT SCENES RUINS THE MOVIE FURTHER!,"This movie was really boring. I couldn't stay up. The photography is dull. The final battle is too similar T1,T2 and Aliens and quite frankly expected more. I missed Arnold big time. The TV series is far superior.I only managed to watch the directors cut and often the scenes/editing comes off as dull. Bale lacks any form of Charisma and Worthington is actually not required. Moon Bloodgood/Bryce Dallas Howard are wasted here. T3 may have had it's faults but it was far more entertaining than this, and the leads actually had better things to do. This movie reminds me of Mummy 3."
5,The Best Terminator Yet!!!!!,"Im am a huge Terminator fan, and have seen all the movies more than twice, and I have to say this is the BEST of the whole series!!! The movie is action packed and has a sloid plot, with many twists and turns, that leave you guessing throughout the whole movie. Christian Bale And Sam Worthington in my opinion both played an excillent role in the movie. I won't really tell the plot for those of you who have never seen it, but all i'll say is that it takes place a few years after Terminator 3, and Skynet has terminated half of the human race, now creating different types, and models of Terminators to destroy those who survived the deadly attack, now called the Resistance. Buit when Skynet produces it's deadlyest Terminator model yet, the fate of the world is again in the hands of John Connor, and a few freinds, oh and lets just say...lol....Arnold's Back. 5/5!"
1,DVD release is a disaster,"Agree with other reviewers. Warner pulled this same stunt with Trick r' Treat (only putting bonus features on the Blu disc). I decided not to buy this dvd because of this. There's no reason at all that the unrated version should not be available on DVD. I understand that DVD cannot match the picture quality or sound that Blu provides, however, DVDs have always been able to support audio commentaries and bonus featurettes and to not put them on the DVD and still charge the same prices is ridiculous. With all the firmware problems on Blu and the fact that my TV does not support HDMI (and I'm not replacing the TV until it breaks). The more that studio pull this garbage the less likely I will ever convert to Blu. In fact, I now hope the Blu format fails in favor of digital downloads for HD (with DVD still being available of course). Very, very stupid Warner."
3,WHERE ARE THE BONUS FEATURES??? SERIOUSLY!,I WAS REALLY UPSET THAT THE LATEST DVD RELEASE OF TERMINATOR SALVATION DID'NT HAVE THE BONUS FEATURES ON IT. I DON'T LIKE FACT THAT THE DVD SALES MARKETING IS SHOVING BLUE RAY DVDs AND THAT OBNOXIOUS SECOND DISC OF DIGITAL COPIES DOWN OUR THROATS. WHY ARE YOU GOING TO PAY EXTRA FOR A DIGITAL COPY DISC IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO USE THE DVD MOVIE ONLY?I ALWAYS BUY DVD WITH BONUS FEATURES BECAUSE IT GOES OVER HOW THE MOVIE WAS MADE AND INTERVIEW WITH THE ACTORS AND OTHER MOVIE EXTRAS.THE DVD SALES MARKETERS ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF THEY START AND CONTINUE TO DO THIS.AS FAR AS THE MOVIE IS CONCERNED IT WAS GIVEN A 3 STAR RATING BY ME BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE STORY LINE COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN A LITTLE BETTER. THE ACTION SCENES WERE TO A MINIMUM AND IT DRAGGED AT TIMES. I'M A BIG TERMINATOR FRANCHISE FAN SINCE ITS FIRST RELEASE IN 1985. I JUST THOUGHT IT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER.
2,Terrible flick!,"This movie sucks! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the great special effects. Extremely bad acting, HELLO......Christian Bale, need I say more? Extremely stupid ending too! My God, who approved this script? They should be castrated!And who ever thought Bale would be good as John Connor? He sucks in everything else, but I had high hopes for this movie and just like everything else with him in it, it blows. If you just have to see it to complete the series, rent it from red box so you only waste a buck. If you suffer from insomnia, it is better for you than sleeping pills."
5,A very slick action film,"Terminator Salvation is an extremely beautiful action movie. We finally get an entire movie based around the future war. Not only do we get to see the classic terminators, but we get a ton of fascinating new implements of Skynet. Watching this movie on Blu-Ray will be an amazing experience."
2,A combonation of all 3 previous films in one and not in a good way,"This film could have been really good but it seemed like have way through it they seemed to have lost the concept or direct they were headed and fell back to what was already done before. The last half of the film had to many things that were taken and repeated from the first two films, and it just seems overally tacky...such as when the terminatior used his dad's voice to find john in the steel stairway are and then we he John tried shooting the guy and loading the gun again, or with the steel and then trying to freze him all of these were taken from T2. The only thing that was orignial and creative about this film was the future termiator who was more human than ever and was the only real likable character in the whole film, which they should have just centered the movie around versus the route they ended up going. This film was alot better than the third film in the installment of films but not by much."
3,Way Out There...,"This movie is way out there... Not sure where they were trying to go with this movie but, I really can't wait till Arnold is no longer playing Governator and gets back to create another actual movie and this one is redone. I was looking to see Terminators such as Arnold, the T-1's (from the original movie,) Summer Glau, and Kristianna Loken's characters in it or at least similarities to them, there wasn't. Only briefly there was a single scene where one of the terminators sort of favored Arnold, even then it was a piss poor similarity to his character.Outside of these nuances, the overall movie was good, just not a James Cameron movie and it shows."
5,Amazing story line with top notch acting!!,"I almost didn't watch this movie because I could never stomach Christian Bale & by the time I was finished watching it, I had totally changed my mind about him!! I now LOVE him but especially adore Sam Worthington!! This was top notch special effects & amazing acting by all in the movie. The story line was fantastic and well written also. I think I have watched this at least 20 times already and I never get sick of it! I totally recommend this to add to your ""Terminator"" collection."
2,Terminator Salvation needs salvation,"I had actually watched his forgot about it, rented it realized I had watched it and thought very little at it.Basically the series lost all momentum, in this movie."
3,Decent,Good but not great. Seemed to move a little to fast but was entertaining. Acting was good but not great.
3,movie review,It was a good movie ..........could have been a little longer I think .....cool special effects ......more TnA would have been nice
2,Just Plain Sucks ...,"2009R: Almost a total waste of time to watch and SciFi is my favorite genre. LOVED the previous Terminator flicks, but this one is reminiscent of a bad Mad Max rendition - old, dreary looking sets, lackluster coloration, just plain sucks - depressing even. MFJLabs 2x (rare review for low rating)."
1,Terminator Salvation in Blue Ray Fails to Deliver HD quality,"This was the first Blue Ray disc that I bought and I have to say the Terminator Salvation movie was so poorly mastered that I could not tell the difference between this ""HD"" blue ray film and an old regular DVD quality film on my HD tv. Even broadcast looks better on my TV...Story was mediocre, and special effects were OK ...would have been better if this was a REAL HD movie instead of this crap full of unprocessed picture noise."
4,Different DVD versions,"Not saying anything egative about the film itself, however it makes me mad when the public is duped into thinking that the ""theatrical"" version of the movie is the only cut of the movie that will be released on dvd and if you want the rest of the extras you have to buy it on blu ray. That is false advertising in my humble opinion."
4,I bought the directors cut DVD at Target today.,They have the exclusive right to sell the 2 disc Director's Cut. Go over to Target and buy it while you can.
4,Better than average,"After Judgement Day, John Connor realizes that he must save his father, Kyle Reese, from the machine slave camp. He meets a lone soldier named Marcus. He has come from the past and challenges John with an impossible choice that will change the future of the human race.This movie is about as good as the other Terminator films. The acting is better, and the action is also on par with the others. The story in this movie is a bit less intense. I think the difference is that in the other movies, a catastrophic and Earth shattering global event is about to take place that must be avoided. This movie is more of a personal crisis for John. It's a good story, but it lacks the drama of an impending nuclear holocaust of something like that. It's still good though. The special effects, fight scenes, action, and everything else you like about Terminator is still here. It's a really good movie, you might want to check it out."
2,I hope this is not the end of the franchise,I did not really like Termin. Salvation too much. Maybe because it's hard to imagine a terminator movie without Schwarzenegger but just could not really get into the film and found it to be a little boring. There is a lot of action and sci fi scenes but the storyline just did not really interest me. For someone who likes science fiction movies in general then you could find it entertaining but as for part of the terminator franchise it is my least favorite compared to the previous 3.Peter J. Miller
4,Not bad at all,"I was surprised how much I liked this movie considering all the bad reviews. How can anyone complain about it being too dark or grim? It's post nuclear war, helloooo it's not meant to be a happy, family type of film. Very good sci-fi flick, cant wait for the blu ray in Dec"
1,DVD gets hosed again!!!,Blu-ray gets a 2 disc director's cut while dvd gets only a pos single disc with only the theatrical cut. Getting tired of having some studios try to shove blu ray down my throat by withholding all good special features and added footage. DVD is still the top selling format. Wish they'd just give us the quality of discs we used to get.
1,Is this the best they can do?,"Can someone tell me what this movie was about?The plot (if there WAS one) was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again (and have done) in spite of Edward Furlong's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor.There's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED.One HUGE disappointment. Sorry - I WON'T ""be back"" if this is the best they can do!!"
1,worst Terminator ever,This was the worst Terminator movie ever. Christian Bale can not act. He is the same in every movie I have ever seen him in.
4,great movie,loved this movie. this is one of those that'll stay in my collection. cant wait for the next one.
4,Director's cut even better than the theatrical,"I found this movie to be very good, especially since it finally brought the franchise out of the present day and into the future. Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington give excellent performances. The action and special effects are great. The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film. Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately, but they forget that it has always been Skynet's goal to kill Connor, not Reese, and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor's father."
3,Terminator...the Rebuilding of a Franchise,"For Terminator Fans, of which I am one, this was an entertaining movie. It was a fun movie to watch on a slow weekend evening. It was the best of the recent man vs. machine genre movies. There is now a platform for rebuilding the franchise now that previous casts have moved on to other things."
1,SICK OF BLU!!,"I AM SOOOOOO SICK OF BEING TREATED AS A SECOND CLASS CONSUMER JUST BECAUSE I DO NOT OWN A BLU-RAY PLAYER...IF THE STUDIOS THINK I AM GOING TO BEND TO SUCH PRESSURE THEY ARE SADLY MISTAKEN, I WOULD RATHER BUY MY PURCHASES ON ITUNES AND BYPASS THE MEDIUM ALL TOGETHER..SO FRACK U WARNER BROS..AND YOUR ROBOT TOO!!!"
3,Not as good as the other 3,I fell asleep after about of hour of watching this movie....it was ok i guess looked great on blu-ray but as far as the movie goes....nowhere near as good as the other 3 terminator movies
1,Horrible!,"If all you care about in a movie is one action sequence after another, hardly any dialog, zero character development, and no story.... this is defiantly the movie for you. This movie makes T3 look like a classic and the TV show Emmy worthy."
1,Boycott to this movie,"Hello people,I suggest not buying this movie until the DVD is similar to the Blu-ray!"
1,OMG,"Simply horrible. The acting, dialogue, directing. Even the CGI wasn't that good. Steaming Pile of...."
2,lacking,I found myself watching the movie and some thing felt amiss it was an action packed movie but something just was alittle off. McG just doesnt get it right I loved the fist 3 movies yea even #3 I loved the sarah connor chronicles but this movie just wasnt terminator I walked away feeling very dissapointed
1,ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE !!!!!!,This is by far the worst Terminator Movie ever.None of the action of previous movies.No major fight scenes like in the first movie between the robots and humans Lots of talking and no action.If you liked the action in the 3rd one (a lot of people obviously did not by what I have been reading for other reviews)then stay away from this one. I never fall asleep in movies but I begged for a pillow.lOTS OF PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKED THIS ONE BUT ACTION JUNKIES BEWARE I got your back!!!!!
1,"Saw this down in Orlando, FL","T4 isn't as good as the 1st.I had a movie ticket to use, & Paramount wasn't showing Star Trek that night.It was OK.I rate it Z4, as in ZZZZ."
2,Ending... (No Spoilers here),I won't add any spoilers here for those of you who don't know how the movie ends. I liked the movie... until the end. What happened at the end was so cheesy that it ruined the movie for me. Surely they could have come up with a better ending than that.
3,I like to call for a swap,How about getting James Cameron and Christian Bale together for a remake of The Terminator and burn the rest of the Terminator history. We can ask for a bad version with McG and Schwarz. The two respective groups fit perfectly together.
3,Ehhhhh,Not near as good as I was hoping. Thought it would take place right after Sky-Net took over not some years down the line. I hope one day I'm good enough to twist a few wires on a car that has set for years and am able to start it within a minte or two. ;)
2,confusing and depressing,"I was disappointed in this sequel, tho the special effects and most action was terrific. The plot was disjointed and the characters unclear to me. The ending was predictable early on, and was a clone of ""I Robot."" The film's monotone coloration was depressing, and the Terminators stereotypic - including their menacing growls (huh?) and skeletal teeth (they eat hot dogs?) The attempt to weave in Arnold S. at the end and reproduce the molton-steel gimmick (Terminator 2)felt disjointed and like an afterthot.Save your money."
2,Why did they bother to buy this franchise?,"<<SPOILER>> <<SPOILER>> <<SPOILER>> <<SPOILER>> <<SPOILER>>Short_N_Sweet: a mindless string of action sequences w/exceedingly little dialogue/plot development. A two hour film filled w/too ridiculous to believe stunts. The kicker is Connor getting a 2"" wide steel bar rammed through his spinal column, & supposedly his heart. It's OK, though... He still walks w/assistance to a far away helicopter, undergoes emergency cardio-thoracic surgery in the dusty wide open desert. Then receives a heart transplant... Yeah, suuuuuuuuuuuuuuure. Bale was great in Batman. His performance here is uninspired & flat. This film is way too short on character/plot substance, & far too laden w/mindless action. I'm glad I only wasted $3.00 on a rental."
1,Termanator damnation!,"I have enjoyed previous Terminator movies but with all due respect, this one reeks. If is vastly inferior to the others and you need to save your money until/if a real one is made in the future!"
1,DVD customers get the shaft!,"Am I reading this right?No extra features or director's cut on DVD- It's blu-ray only?I am a huge Terminator fan, and couldn't wait for this to come out. But apparently, this is a blu-ray game and not about Terminator.I will not buy the blu-ray or the DVD because of this. Shame on them."
2,"""I knew James Cameron. And you sir, McG, are no James Cameron!""","I had such high expectations for this film, until I started reading about the director, and my trepidation started to set-in. However, the trailers looked great, so I hoped he actually was onto something. Then literally 5 minutes into the film, when John Connor crawled out of wherever he was and everything was gone for some reason not known, I knew that my worse fears came true.The plot was very weak and completely disjointed and at time undecipherable. Christian Bale who I really like slept-walked through this role, and his whispering of his lines was extremely annoying.Why they entrusted this franchise to a music video director with a wannabe rapper/DJ name(What is up with the name McG??? Are you serious?),I have no idea. He screwed this up as badly as the Fantastic Four director (and they let him at it twice, oh no!)"
1,No DVD Director's cut = no purchase.,"I'm really disappointed that Warner Bros has decided to only release the Director's cut in the US on Blu-Ray. Like many others, I agree that Blu-Ray should not be forced down consumer's throats. Warner Bros will lose $ales over this decision. It's very short-sighted. I will not be buying this DVD version and I will not buy the Blu-Ray version either. Hope someone at Warner Bros gets the message."
1,Cuidado Brasileiros,"Compradores do Brasil, cuidado, este blu-ray no possui legendas em portugus.Beware custumers from brazil, there's no portuguese subtitles on this blu-ray."
2,Terrible Addition to the Terminator Franchise,"I bought this movie because I really like the Terminator series and wanted to see what that they have done with the storyline. I was supremely disappointed. While there are some good special effects, they are primarily composed of motorcycle and truck chase scenes that quickly become monotonous. The storyline is dull and unimaginative, so much so that it's easy to stop paying attention and loose focus in the midst of one spectacular explosion after another. It would have been nice if there was a strong story and the action sequences served to further the story, but sadly this is simply a special effects movie without a good plot. At the end, once you realize it's finally over you're left wondering, ""what just happened?"" They clearly left the door open for another Terminator movie, but this one was so bad that I have no anticipation to see the next chapter. What a waste of money."
2,"Explosions, or how skynet meets transformers!","I had to check I was watching a terminator movie. Lots of explosions, and lots of explosions.. did i mention stuff blows up constantly?You would think I would have been glued to my seat.. but I got pretty bored with this movie. And the hybrid terminator that was more advanced than the Arny T101 was built by humans? And the young Kyle Reese was kind of a dork. If this was a free streaming movie on Prime I would have stopped watching it, but I paid 2.99 so I decided to see if it got any better.... NO. It may be useful for like wallpaper background video while you have people over and your cranking some decent music."
3,Far better than T3 (T2 is the best in the series),"After just watching the movie, it would have been better if it had less action and more mystery. It also should have been more character driven with Worthington and more subtle- Movie was much better than what the main stream movie critics give it credit for. Again its far better than T2 but not as good as T2."
2,Just not good.,I don't think the this movie even came close to the other 3 Terminators..... They tried to hard to re-vamp the series in my opinion.
3,Slam bam thank you ma'am,"Lots of action and thrills here, if not enough decent acting. But that's hardly the point of this franchise, and on that level T4 delivers. The script is ok, and the basic concept is a good one. If all you want is some high-tech whiz-bangery, this should do it.Disconcertingly, at various moments in the film it's not easy to know if Christian Bale is man or machine; his somewhat wooden style is almost uber-ironic here. But McG continues to deliver the goods, visually, though this one feels somehow hollow, despite excellent effects. T4, while better than T3, never approaches T2. But then again, James Cameron has rather more of a sense of humor than McG.Worth watching after you've seen T2 three or four times, perhaps."
4,"Great Action, Good Story","I liked this movie a lot, but I enjoy the TV series much more. It is easier to follow the time-travel elements in the TV series over the movie T-4.I thought it was a great way to weave the transcendent mythos of:a man/not man coming to save mankind, dying or humanity as he gives them his heart to do so."
3,The Terminator? No Way. Good Flick? Totally,"Ok, so the ""Terminator"" films are legend. Arnold, Hamilton and a slew of goofy one liners, chilling murders and mind bending temporal paradox theories really defined a generation for sci-fi. With all of that in my head, I waited with baited breath to see how Christian Bale would handle the Terminator legacy... I was disappointed. I'm not saying I didn't really like the film, but there is more ""Transformers"" than ""Terminator"" about it. So, my bottom line: If you like Christian Bale, great action, amazing acting and heart pounding music... you're going to love this movie. I really did like it, but it was definitely NOT ""The Terminator."""
3,Back to the Future,"Now I will start off by saying that I agree with Cameron that the series should have ended with T2. I didn't and we have T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and the immortal line ""Talk to the hand."" TERMINATOR: SALVATION makes a better fit in that it takes us onward in time instead of having endless Terminators come back in time to save/kill John Connor. It has a serviceable performance by Bale as John Connor. Moon Bloodgood and Sam Worthington (actually a contender for James Bond) are worth the price of admission. The CG Arnie (the head on the body of Roland Kickenger -- who is not going to be Conan) looks fake. A popcorn film and nothing more. If you are looking for TERIMATOR or T2 you will be disappointed."
1,What a let down!!,The movie is not what I have come to expect from a terminator movie. I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen. That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action. I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence. How he sent his father back to his mom. And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'. Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing. I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion. Just don't expect any action. It's not a `fun' kill em' all kind of film; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip.
1,Beating the dead horse,"They should have stopped at T2, but the cash cow can always be milked to death. I loved the first 2, but they went downhill from there. From T1 Kyle Reese said the first terminators had rubber skin, and were easy to spot. In this one they have never even seen a terminator with skin on it, rubber or real.There were many plot holes and really bad cheesiness like"" Oh his heart cant take it."" ""Then please take mine."" So if you like your action dark and hard to see with some big explosions added in. Mix in no plot or characters that you give a rats ass about. Then this is the movie for you."
1,Worst terminator movie,This is the worst terminator movie. How anyone can like it is beyond me 1-3 were good this one was utter crap.
2,"Rent it (unless it's cheaper to buy it ""previously viewed"")","In Mad Max there was a guy named Max, and we got to see some stuff about him, his life, and the world he lives in, and at least some of us came to like him, respect him, and maybe even admire him, so that when his wife and kid get brutally murdered it's not just a random act of violence like we see on TV, or read about in papers every day.The people most responsible for Terminator Salvation do not appear to understand this, and maybe someone should tell them.It's less a film than an ad for action figures.Were there any action figures? I know 7-11 had cups. I doubt they sold very many. And I'm positive they didn't have any 5-story tall terminator machines that could sneak up on people in the middle of an arid wasteland."
3,T4(Salvation) is in the right spot as the 4th movie,"I'v enjoyed all 4 films. The only thing I notice missing from Salavation was the pacing was off. The first 3 films(yes, even the 3rd) kept up that relentless, stalking, edge of your seat type pacing that the 4th film just lacked.In terms of quality of production, acting, effects, it's top notch. It just doesn't flow as well as the earlier films.So in my opinion it would come in 4th behind the previous films. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it or thought it was bad.......just not quite the experience for me as the earlier films. Will still buy it though when it comes out on Blu-RayI'm looking forward to the next film. Bring it on!"
2,"All action, no heart","People who have grown up with the Terminator franchise go to see these movies not only for the action, but for storyline. In all Terminator movies (yes this includes number 3) except this one, the action is not the driving force in the story, rather a compliment. Perfect example of this is in T2, this movie is not about an awesome liquid metal robot (he is awesome). T2 is about how a machine at times can be more human than us, so this is a character study. That is my big criticism with T4, it is a good action movie but thats it, there is no story. I did not care if John connor lived, and if you don't care if the ""saviior"" of mankind lives, than there is something wrong here. I felt as if I was watching someone playing a video game."
5,Great DVD,Got this DVD some time ago from Amazon but wasn't able to review it until now.The director's cut is not much different then the regular version but the extras are very nice additions. I'd reccomend this to anyone who liked the film but have not bought the DVD.
5,Robert Urich's Best,I love Robert Urich and his passing was way too soon. This movie is one of his best. I only hope Amazon Live will offer The Lazarus TV series; then I will be really happy!
1,smells bad taste worst,smells bad taste worst .. i opened it up and it was the worst smell i've ever smelled.....the only thing i could imagine what the smell compares to it would be the smell of a rank hooker .. it smelled so bad that my dog ran from the bottle....and the taste was horrific....i used it at dinner and i can still taste it and dinner was about 5 hours ago....disgusting.it was bad i will never try it again ..
4,fantastic,"Delicious. I have been putting this on baked potatoes and they taste 100 times better, would highly recommend, small yet potent."
2,Not for me,I've bought 1 ounce bottle and I didn't like the taste at all. It doesn't have that truffle aroma and flavor. It tasted like olive oil.
5,Lot of Bang for the Buck!,I love this stuff!!A little black truffle oil goes a long way. You can use from one teaspoon to one tablespoon mixed with regular olive oil or even plain old canola oil for the most amazing je ne sais quois.I add about a teaspoon to my Italian salad dressing and it adds a rich depth of flavor.Just tonight we used it on grilled salmon and it was fantastic.I store it in the refrigerator because I use it so slowly that I don't want it to go rancid. If you do store it in the refrigerator you need to pull it out enough ahead that the oil can liquefy.
5,goodeats,[...]This is delicious. Try it on steamed broccoli or cauliflower etc. Subtle and unlike anything you've ever tasted!
2,Not great cleaning,"I just bought this, mostly for a dvd I played once, and got this stuff on the bottom when I laid it on the case...that smudge, two of them will not come off. I bought this because it was cheaper and also had the laser cleaner. I tried the dvd and a severely smudge cd...looks exactly the same.I think I'm going to try and return it. And I think Im also going to have to buy a new dvd for more than I paid for this ""4 in 1 complete clean"" which at least the laser dvd cleaner probably works, but I needed the disc to be cleaned...honestly, never place your discs on the case is what I learned."
3,The wallet is in great condition but...,But the wallet I got did not look like the picture that is being displayed by the seller. Instead the wallet I received has only Wing Gundam on it. The picture on the product on Amazon has Heero Yuy in the foreground and his gundam in the background.
5,The Time is Now,Gotta have this show available for Region 1 viewers. Now would be nice. It's very good comedy that needs to make the rounds. Maybe Santa can help?
2,This Album Could Not SUCK Much More,"I was being a bit generous with the 2 stars. This album was so bad that I pulled into my driveway, hopped out of the car, opened the garage and dropped this CD right into the trash. It was a disappointment to the point of DISGUST.I LOVE ""Emotional""; therefore, I expected more good material from Carl Thomas. ""So Much Better"" was SO MUCH WORSE. The production was bad, the lyrics were bad, and it appears that the worst thing that happened to Carl Thomas was his separation from Bad Boy.My suggestion is that he find some producers he can afford with true talent, STICK TO BALLADS...and never, eva, eva, eva do another record with Baby Cham. Baby Cham is meant for hip-hop."
2,im feelin this....,"this is a hot album, wish it would've got a lil more promotion, at least a video....but yea, every song is hot especially ""Somethin Bout You"" and ""Thought You Should Know""...PROPS!!!"
1,Carl Thomas What About A Refund?,"My dad and I listened to the first 4 songs....I immediately thought, ""Boring...let's throw it out the window!!"" However, my dad urged me to keep it and when we got home, he pulled out the 12 gauge, shot it, and then burned it and spread it's ashes up and down H1 Highway!!! =o Opppss!! Another $10 down the drain....ALOHA! =)"
3,Trying to work it's majic!,"I love Carl Thomas! After waiting three years for a new CD from him, this CD did not capture me out the gates like the first two CD's. I am slowly but surely letting this one work its majic on me."
4,Don't Sleep On This!,I know Carl has been away from the music scene for a few years and maybe that's what it took to produce such a fine album. The problem I have is who is promoting this guy? He should be getting all kinds of air play. If anyone out there is listening (or reading) please give the brother a chance. You won't regret it.
4,Slept on,"I've had this cd since it came out. Like most I didn't know about it until I saw the advertisement on Amazon (Thanks Amazon). I must admit, I wasn't feeling it. It wasn't Emotional and not even Lets Talk about it. But today I listened to it in my car and what a difference. I actually listened to it whereas before I really hadn't. I love it. Glad it is in my collection and recommend it. Just listen to it...it's definately Carl Thomas."
4,It's a shame His first album was the best r&b baby maker ever,This album will definatly derliver what you are looking for. carl's soulful sound is hypmotizing. If you are looking for somthing better than emotional(thomas's 1st album) you will be disaponted. buy the album a take it for face value.
4,Wish more people knew about him,"I love all of Carl Thomas' music! He has a really soulful sound that I appreciate. I was worried that his sound would change under a new label... but it's still him! There are a couple of songs that I fast forward through, but for the most part it's great. I love that he does not need a lot of guest appearances to make an album good. He does it alone. Good job!"
5,Major Bop,"Bus Seat contains one of the best recordings of Donna Lee I've ever heard. Griffin and Terry were clearly spurring each other on during these sessions, and the results were one of the best hard bop records ever made.The rhythm section is great too... Winton Kelly pno, Paul Chambers, bss, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. The overal record demonstrates the height of mainstream Bebop recorded at the end of that era. For me the highlight is Johnny Griffin's tenor... he's got an attack that defies description."
3,I ENJOYED IT...BUT...,"GREAT VIDEO AND AUDIO QUALITY! CONTENT WAS O.K., I GUESS I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING A BIT MORE ELABORATE, LIKE THE MOULIN ROUGE SHOW ""FERRIE"". OTHERWISE IT IS STILL VERY PLEASING TO THE EYE."
3,"Fun to see, but was hoping for more.","Kind of was hoping for more behind the scenes, or interviews etc. Something more like a documentary, but it is just the show. I loved the show, and it was great to see Dita's acts, but I felt like they could have added more. Also some of the full stage shots could have been closer- there's a ton of black space around it, making me feel like I was watching from the back row. And some of the tight shots of Dita were too tight- I wanted to see what the other girls were doing too!"
2,Sound does not work on this DVD,We watched part of this DVD and then the audio went out. I don't know if it is poor quality or only an isolated incident.
2,Real problem playing it on my device.,The thing just froze and went out before it even got going past the first act. I wish I could have seen more. I may buy it at a video store if possible.
3,This is it?,"I assumed being an Oxford World Classic would mean A LOT of footnotes and explanations of words and phrases, but there's almost nothing. At least the poems are presented well."
3,Handle Came Smashed,"I got this with the brittle plastic handle smashed, but I didn't have time to send out for another. I ended up breaking off the remaining pieces of plastic, and sent off my portfolio like that.It's an ""ok"" portfolio case."
2,too many errors,"The book has some serious errors such as a whole section under the Gulkana River that belongs under the Eagle River section. If I wasn't familiar with these rivers, I could be in trouble if I was depending on this book to plan a rafting trip. I have the third edition of this book. You would think they would have corrected all the errors by now! It's good for a general review of each river, but check other resources when planning your trip."
4,A head start,"Not many books are written on this subject, so it was more information than what I could find elsewhere. Although far from perfect, I read through it and at least could identify the rivers I wanted to explore. I didn't expect perfection and found if I needed updated material I could turn to the internet where there's plenty of personal testimonials. I rate this a ""four"" and a definite buy if you want a good Alaska river resource. Whitewater ho!"
1,Ethics violations,"This river guide has been charged with stealing artifacts (tusks) from one of her guided trips in our glorious state. She should have read her own words, a zealot for keeping the pristine, pristine....must be so she can steal it herself. Article in Alaska Daily News ""newsreader"" River Guide Charged With Theft."
1,Not effective at all,"I assume this is the product that comes with the DVD/CD ""Cleaning Kit"" which also includes a radial cd cleaner as well.The Lens Cleaner is incredibly ineffective and didn't improve the reading on both of my DVD players. Also, this product can NOT be used on any gaming system (or at least thats what it says on the package) so I wouldn't trust it to clean your PS2 or XBox lens. I'm going to try outScotch DVD Maintenance KitorGame Dr. 2-DISC Laserblast Optical Lens Cleanerinstead and hope that it does the trick."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"Does't work at all. Tried repetitive times. The voicesays the cleaning will take 20 seconds, but it saysit's clean in 1 second - which it isn't because it doesn't work -- Makes no sense."
1,DONT BUY IT,I just got mine from Walmart and brought it home. Put it in my parents DVD/vcr combo player and before it could finish not finish because my mom wanted to finish watching her movie. But I took it into my room and evin though I did not need to use it on the computer. I did anywats. Couldent hurt...Right??????Now my SONY DVD RW will not detect DVD's. And when I called Philips they sent me to another accessorie companey. .. We will see how this turns out. The DVD/CD lens cleaner broke my DVD burner. ANd now I am stuck haveing to buy a new one. Because of there cleaner.PHILIPS O's ME A NEW DVD BURNER!!!! I WILL TAKE THEM TO SMALL CLAIMS IF I HAVE TO!!!!
4,be more discreptive,i just received this product a few short days after ordering. looks great on my truck however i thought i would be receiving all three sections when i only got the two side peaces the pictures makes it look as though it would include the tailgate but it did not!!!
3,Presence - Future Love,"Of the two mixes of Presence's _Future Love_ on this single, Pete Heller's goes for the more upbeat, club-ready track, leaving the vocals intact and squashing the more melancholy aspects of the track. Who needs sadness when you're dancing? Charles Webster, on the other hand, takes himself on (under his Love From San Francisco guise), still pumping up the tempo some, but keeping some of the original's mood to linger amongst the peppiness."
1,Bad CD Mastering Job,Great music but this CD was transferred from a scratchy vinyl. It sounds dull and one can hear clicks and crackle.
4,Perception is but a multivariate vector ...,"Although it may sound strange, multivariate analysis is a sort of ""philosophy of life"", and Principal Component is its systemic perspective of the reality. Needless to say, this book is a guide to the development of such perception. Both the numerical background and its practical interpretations are discussed taking care of the many different situations in which multivariate approaches are often applied. In this sense, this book is a tool for experts in numerical modelling as well as for those people lacking deep numerical knowledge. I think that there is still a certain gap between theory and application of multivariate statistics, and this may be the main reason for which many different sources are needed to shape a ""personal"" multivariate perspective. Nonetheless, this book definitely represents a barycentre."
3,samurai,ok this figure is ok here s a few things that bug me 1 the sword broke when i was taking it out the rapping the figures skin is way to pale it doesnt have the right hair color and if you drop the figures body breaks easy but can be put together again overall a waist of money
3,Disappointing,"This book deals with the life of Captain Mitsuo Fuchida and his conversion from the attacker of Pearl Harbor to Christian minister. About half the book condenses the war years. The other half focuses on his religious conversion after the war. The book does not delve too deeply into the character of Fuchida's colleagues like Admirals Yamamoto and Nagumo and Captain Minoru Genda. Neither does it go into much detail into the battles Fuchida took part in or his role as part of the Naval High Command after Midway. For the avid military historian looking for a detailed account of Fuchida's role during the war and his comprehensive views on what Japan did wrong, the lack of detail on the war years and the seemingly greater emphasis made on Fuchida's religious conversion in the second half of the book will be a great disappointment. Look for book entitled ""Midway: The Battle that Doomed Japan"" written by Fuchida himself and Masatake Okumiya instead."
2,"Witty, but slow paced and lackluster","Clearly the writers first attempt was decent. The main character is witty and likable. The story is easy to read and funny, albeit a bit far fetched. My only complaint is the storyline pace.... While I'm sure it could be read in a few hours, I found it very slow.The wit of the main character will make you laugh and enjoy the story, but the story drags in many ways and as a result isn't ""page turner"" engaging.Sheldon Seigel, Stuart Woods - more experienced authors in a similar genre."
3,"It's OK, but..","I have this book, and another one in the series. The photos are great, and the narrative that accompanies the photos is good too. The quality of the book and the reproduction of the pictures is first rate. The thing I don't get is that the author shows all these great monuments, statues,buildings, places etc and almost never tells you where they actually are. Sure, I can go to the park and ask the Rangers and I know they can direct me. But why would you create a book on the monuments and not tell you where they actually are? It really detracts from the value of the book as I see it. Maybe someone else will publish a book with more attention paid to the people who will want to see these sites in person, and want to know where they are"
5,Lisa Stansfield can & does (sing) SWING!!!,"This movie is not only great as a musical, but it has superb acting by Lisa Stansfield and an interesting story. No doubt that the music is the best thing about it. The British slang/lingo will keep you on your toes when it come to listening to the dialog.It's got music, romance, good plot, credible acting, well-paced direction and an all around feelgood, overcoming obstacles vibe.Considering that studios will release just about anything on DVD, I sure hope they will put this hidden gem on the little shiny video disk, and also include some extras.If you buy this movie - you will enjoy it!"
2,Good Dancing - Directing Wanted,I read two previous reviews put in for this video and I have no idea what they were talking about. I thought that the plot was slow and weak. A few of the dance moves were entertaining but it was not worth the $3 I rented it for.
5,Family dining goes to a whole new dimension with this book!,"I've really enjoyed the Whole Family Cookbook. While I have a few recipes where I use Kristene's technique of separating portions for the kids, this book takes family dining to a whole new dimension. There is such a wide array of interesting and healthy recipes to choose from, ranging from appetizers to desserts. Kristene has found a way to prepare a meal that appeals to adult tastes while satisfying children at the same time. Many of the recipes offer serving suggestions for the kids that make it fun for them to eat. We use the ""No Thank you bite"" that Kristene mentions to introduce new things. Finally, I can prepare a low-fat meal that I enjoy without having to make a separate meal for the children!"
4,Finally it's out!,"This is more than just a historical curiosity. These selections were recorded between 1966 and 1973. From the sound of it, they proceed in reverse chronological order. ""Drunk Man"" sounds like it was left off the ""I Need Some Money"" or ""That is Why You're Overweight"" albums. Except it's better! Turbulence is like nothing I've ever heard Eddie Harris play. It sounds like Jimi Hendrix's ""Band of Gypsies"" period if Jimi played Electronic Saxophone in Santana's Miles Davis-influenced, Mid-seventies period. Whooh! Weird. On the second CD, there is very nice straight ahead stuff, including selections he recorded with Cedar Walton, Billy Higgins and Ron Carter. Very Heady Stuff. Amazing re-issue."
5,farrrrrrrr out!,first off how dope is the cover? eddie in drag! tight! wish they would have done the cover art more justice..but thats the classics label for ya. anyway kudos to them for releasing my favorite eddie harris jam..this has got it all..electric psych freak outs...funky jamming and hard bop idioms..this sucker is killer...get it.
3,Interesting film on low budget,This film was shot at Singing Springs in the Angeles National Forest near Los Angeles. Most of the building and forest were destroyed in the 2009 Station Fire. Singing Springs is still in business and filmmakers now use it for its Apocalyptic look.C Thomas did a fine job of filming this little film. Cast and crew were very professional.
3,Don't recommend it for weathered mahogany,"It did a beautiful job on teak, but didn't help mahogany. It was promising at first but the final wasn't much improved."
2,didn't care for this,"i thought this was supposed to do a great job, but I think i'm better off with PLEDGE. it kinda' left wet stains on my table but eventually dried up and went away."
2,"SS bowl is fine, hanger is junk...","The stainless steelbowl is just that, a stainless steel dog bowl (kinda hard to screw that up). The hanger arrived in three pieces and this ISN'T a put together item. Honestly, even if it was intact, it wouldn't work very well. I would have had to physically bend the hanger in order to keep the bowl upright while installed on the side of the cage. It might be ok for smaller kennels, but apparently not my larger one. Oh well, I'm just going to put the bowl on the floor of the kennel and hope my Lab doesn't step in it. You're getting what you pay for here...and I got A BOWL."
1,Makes you fall asleep,"This is my review on the book: What Happend In Hamelin. I have to read this book for my English class and let me tell you....this is boring. I'm almost finished with it but I swear that to get through the book you have to think about something else! Giest and Gast were the most unorigianal characters an author could have the nearve to create. The rest of the characters (Master Hermann, Hilde ect.) are also boring characters. I've read many good books, and this is not one of them. The children killing rats idea I thought was sending younger kids a bad message,saying that it's okay to kill rats so they will stop invading your stupid little town. One piece of advice: Don't buy this book and get some other GOOD book that is worth your read!"
3,Not as good as I expected after reading the reviews,"Having bought this video on the 5-star reviews by all the Amazon reviewers, I was expecting an epic ski movie along the lines of ""The Blizzard of Oz."" Although the movie is good, I don't think it comes close to any of the Greg Stump videos. Ironically, it seems as if this movie is a rip-off of some of Stump's original, cutting edge films. In fact, I would say it is a cross between Stump's videos and my own homemade ski videos, which admitedly, I parodied in my own flicks.I am not totally down on Global Storming. The skiing, scenery and soundtrack are pretty good, although some of the photography and sound quality isn't top notch at times - no DTS. I just didn't find it too original -- i.e. I thought it was basically a generic flick.It is good, however, to see a good ski movie on DVD. I have essentially scrapped my VHS and most of the tape that go with it."
3,OK but not that great,"The reviews here defenitely overrate this movie. The footage is pretty good, there are a lot of cool mountains and fast skiing down steeps. However, it lacks variety and gets boring after a while. It would be ok if it were only 30 minutes but then it is just too repetetive. The whole film lacks outstanding runs or jumps or tircks that you want to rewind and see over and over again like other ski movies. The rapping session is painful. The film is better than some but not the best."
3,Hoover Cannister Vacuum,"This is a fairly convenient vacuum; however, there are several flexible stem and hose connections to the actual machine. What is annoying is that that the hose keeps disconnecting from the stem and I have to keep putting it together which interrupts the process."
2,You get what you pay for...,"The metal tube that connects to the hose, does not have ANY locking mechanism, so it often comes apart, VERY annoying. I now have it rubber band together. Also, the power is pretty weak, you would have to go over the same spot several times just to get the smaller surface stuff sucked away. For the same price, probably would get more for your money with a strong hand held.Definitely would NOT recommend!"
2,"Really cute, too bad it doesn't work well","I bought this vacuum to clean a small (about 700 sq. ft.) house I rent. It's an adorable vacuum which is good because there's not a lot of storage so it kind of sits out there, and it's definitely not an eyesore. Unfortunately, it just doesn't clean so well. The vacuum power is reasonable if not vigorous, but the handle is too short -- you need to bend over to use it, even my 5' 4"" girlfriend is bent over halfway using the thing. I guess it's good that you're down there because the hose detaches constantly and you need to put it back together. Be careful that you don't use the vacuum enough to fill up the bag! We went all over town -- in a major urban area, no less -- to finally find bags that fit the thing. Unfortunately, I absolutely would not buy this again. Only gets two stars because it appears to actually generate a vacuum consistently and without trouble."
4,Fits the bill perfectly and affordably,"Last year, I had hard wood floors installed in my home, and I wanted a new canister cleaner to clean up the dust and such. I shopped around quite a bit locally before I found this Hoover.I've been completely satisfied with this cleaner. It would be nice if it were bagless because the bags are hard to find unless I buy them online.2011 update - I am still using this vacuum cleaner, and I am pretty happy with it. There has been one downside. The electrical cord tends to head back inside the vacuum on its own, so I have to tie a knot in the cord when I am cleaning so that it doesn't retract before I am ready. For me, this doesn't take away from the item's usefulness.I have been buying replacement bags here on Amazon.com at a decent price."
2,it is o.k.,I use it when I clean my son and daughter in lsws home. The spring that causes the cord to rewind already does not work and the little button on the top that shows if the bag is full fell out. The suction is poor
5,very pleasant surpirse,"I wanted a vacuum cleaner for bare floors (one without a rotating beater brush that scatters debris) and this one fit the bill. When I got it home, I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it performed. Strong suction, light weight, and ideal for bare floors. Couple the performance with the low price, and I could not be more pleased."
1,I curse this thing every time I use it,"Yes, it's cute. Yes, it's portable. No, I didn't expect a whole lot of suction, but this is what we bought because we were on a tight budget and also had very little storage space in our new home. Why do I curse it, every time I use it? Because the extension falls off the hose, and all the brushes fall off the extension! I'm usually in flip-flops when I vacuum and so many times I've been hit in the toe by falling parts! It also isn't that compact when it comes to storage. It takes up just as much space as any other vacuum cleaner, as far as I'm concerned."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I agree with the other ladies who have written reviews: Cute litte vacuum, no suction and the dang wand won't stay together - extremely annoying! Is there no quality control anymore? Didn't Hoover notice this really, really bad flaw??? Don't waste your money just because it's cute and not a bad price! They couldn't even give it to me now."
1,Cute BUT......,Purchased this as a fill in until I could get my vac system installed. It sort of works.. it may or may not pick up the dirt on the carpet. Seems to work ok if you are just using the wand. I thought that with the Hoover name this would be a nice little vac to have on hand. Don't waste your money!
1,Not recommended!,"We own this little vacuum cleaner. At that time, I bought this product because I had small house and I thought this little vacuum cleaner would be a good. Also, I have been told that Hoover make high quality vacuum cleaner, but this product made me very disappointed! We use a vacuum cleaner twice a month. After few months of using this product its wheels came off and its Floor attachement broke. The floor attachement part come off very often while you are using it. Since its motor is not powerful, I do not recommend it to use on the carpet."
4,Good little vacuum,"This is a good little vacuum and I can't complain about the price. It's light but powerful. One problem...the metal wand constantly detaches from the plastic wand it attaches to. It's dropped on my foot a couple of times which really HURTS. No matter how tight I insert it, it eventually detaches. I hope someone from Hoover reads this and that they do something about it."
2,Cute but faulty manufacturing,"This vacuum is very cute to look at. I love the orange and the fact that it's lightweight but that's where the love affair ends. The wand is always falling off and I have resorted to keeping it off and using it like an oversized dustbuster. I suppose you can duct tape it together but what's the point of that? It is terrible on carpeting, even very flat low shag carpets. The bags are hard to find and expensive. I usually just reuse the ones I have, cutting other close looking bags to size. You have to constantly clean the filter because it clogs up so fast and then all suction is lost.It's cheap though and ok for small areas but backbreaking for larger spaces. Don't recommend it unless you live in a one bedroom apartment without carpeting, don't want to spend a lot, vacuum only a few times a month , and don't mind appliances that fall apart while you're using them."
1,"Cute, but won't stay together","This vacuum is adorable and cleans my hardwood floors well enough. Unfortunately, the hose has a tendency to disconnect from the vacuum head, which turns a normal household chore into an exercise in frustration. You vacuum for a bit and then have to try to reconnect it all. I can't say I'd recommend this vacuum to anyone unless they are just looking for a cute bulbous orange prop for their home.6/19: Update. I've revised my review down to ""hate it"" based on having more experience with this product. It's truly not a vacuum you should consider unless you're a masochist."
2,"good looks, but no substance","I purchased this vacuum for my small apartment. It is compact and has a playful orange design. As others have mentioned, the vacuum cleaner sunction is average at best and parts do tend to feel cheap. The retractable cord is no longer working -- only after a few uses. The biggest problem for me is that the vacuum exhaust smells badly, and the entire apartment needs to be aired out for 1/2-1 hour to get rid of any residual smell from vacuuming. I'll be leaving my apartment in a month, and will leave the vacuum cleaner behind with a ""Free"" sign on it."
2,Hoover insists there is no known problem with the machine,"The vacuum power is decent. However, the cord stopped retracting after 3 uses, and the nozzle constantly separates from the long metal wand. One moment the vacuuming is going well, and the next you are holding only the nozzle (with the hose attached) while the metal wand clunks as it falls to the floor.Phoned Hoover. They insist there is no known issue with this vacuum cleaner."
4,Hoover makes the best!! and Amazon has the best price!,This is a great little vacuum cleaner -- easy to handle -- suction is excellent!! There are few canister vacuums available -- this is just what I wanted --- didn't want one run on batteries that needed umpteen hours to charge -- and the cord is retractable so you aren't saddled with a long cord while you move around -- I like this product VERY much! And its body looks like a face!!! I have named him Hoover!!
4,I gave it four stars because I haven't had it long,"This Hoover is light and compact. It has good suction. The attachments will fall off if they are not inserted properly. The cord automaticaly retracts so there are no cords to wrap around and no belts to replace as you use Hoover bags that you can purchase right here on Amazon. The color is nice. So far, I have no complaints. The price is right and it does more then what I paid for in all honesty. I also like that I can carry it around easily or roll it from section to section. It works well on my carpet and hardwood floors."
3,The Hoover is OK,"As stated by other customers the parts want to fall off while vacuumingbut I think it has pretty good suction for the small vac. It also manuevers pretty good. So I will keep it. It is a nice little vac for floors and rugs but I would not get it for large area carpeted floors. No way, you need a big vac for that. Invest in Dyson, or Electrolux.Something like the big ones."
4,The Little Orange......That Could,"Great little vaccum for those, I hate a dust buster people, like myself. Works great for those little jobs around the house. We also use them at work."
2,Good Looks - don't count,"Purchased this Hoover 3 months ago. I currently have a Eureka Mighty Mite and decided that I wanted to have another lightweight canister vacuum for downstairs. I happened to come across the Hoover Bright Orange canister vacuum and thought it was so neat looking, and since it was a Hoover - how could you go wrong.Well the problems are as follows: suction - fair at best; wand connecting to the head won't stay put - it keeps coming apart no matter how hard you push the wand into the head; the bag - since I wasn't getting any suction I checked the bag and found that though it was only half-filled, the bottom of the bag had disintegrated - this happened twice. I'm not sure if this was due to its close proximity to the filter/motor, but I have never had a bag do this on any other vacuum cleaner I've owned.Sorry to say, but it's a great looking vacuum, but that's the only thing going for it.Definitely buy the Eureka Mighty Mite if you're looking for a vacuum for light cleanups."
2,"Looks good, performs ok, falls apart though","I love to look at my little orange hoover and it doesn't do a bad job of cleaning up a 1 bed apartment that includes hard wood floors and a shaggy rug. But!!! It is SO annoying to use because the ""telescoping chrome wands"" will not stay fixed together. You will spend half of your cleaning time putting the attachements together...and watch out when they fall they don't break something. I hope Hoover read these reviews and change this design fault. Until they do I recommend you go for something else."
1,RIP,"Bought this vac at a local store, it died within a month! And just after I'd finally found bags for the darn thing!"
2,No suction,"This vacuum cleaner is very cute and practical(you can vacuum under the furniture) but at 8 amps, it is not powerful enough for carpet. I bought mine at best Buy for less than $50 and returned it."
3,Not too bad for small NYC living,"I bought this when I lived in a teeny 1 bedroom apartment in the east village. It did a pretty good job of covering the small work it had to do there. I took it to a 2 bedroom apartment and then to a 4 and it couldn't quite cut it anymore. The pieces wouldn't stay together and the suction went and one day it just stopped going mid vacuum.But it lasted at least 2 years of small apartment living and did a decent job and is easy to move around furniture.It annoying to have to find bags for it, not many places carry them, but you can order them online."
3,OK little vac for the money and size.,"This vacuum is easy to use and has pretty good suction when the bag is brand new. It is designed with two filters and uses hypo allergenic bags. The retractable cord is really nice and the on/off switch and cord retract buttons are really big. It's small size allows it to get under furniture and into corners which a larger head can not do. The suction adjuster is a nice feature also.I bought it because I have a small house and I wanted a simple machine. It works better on hard floors than carpet. For the size of the machine the cord is really long.However if you have pets it doesn't have the pick up to deep clean the fur out of the carpet. The bag is tiny and fills up quickly. Luckily the bags are inexpensive. It also tips over easily.I've had my vacuum for several years now and haven't had any repair issues.This vacuum is ideal for a student dorm room or studio apartment or a small house with mostly hard floors.Hoover Portable Canister Vacuum, Bagged, S1361"
1,frustration,"A huge disappointment!Wow how frustrating.... Bought this at a local store and after using it twice am 100 percent sure i will retun it...I love canisters! But this is just awful!Falls apart every 5th sweep both on hardwood and carpet so i taped it together. Suction is fine, could be stronger though on carpet but for this price you can't expect too much. Cord is WAY to short!Of well should have done research...."
1,It's cute.... and that's about it.,"The first warning sign should be the packaging. NO information. Zero. So let me fill you in: this is an 8 amp vacuum. Now you know why everyone says it has poor suction. It's also pretty tough to clean carpet very well without a rotating brush, which this is also lacking. NO indication of that on the package, no picture showing you that you're buying a canister vac with no brush (dumb). Hose comes off the head because the only thing holding it there is friction. The bag is minuscule, seriously. I'd like to say this vacuum sucks, but really it can't even do that. Small, light and cute are the only things going for it. So disappointing because I like Hoover's stuff, we love our simple old Tempo widepath and I'm going to go return this and buy a Tempo for the office as well."
2,Do NOT get this vacuum,"I have no problem with the attachments that come with this vacuum. I love the no-frills approach, and it comes with only what you could possibly need. I don't even have a problem, as some people have mentioned, with the wand coming apart. I would be happy with this vacuum if not for one thing: THE SUCTION. It has very poor suction. When it comes right down to it, that's the main reason for having a vacuum, no?If you live in a dorm or want to vacuum up your hardwood floors, this would probably work fine, but for expanses of carpet more than a few feet (especially with cats. What was I thinking?) go for something more robust."
3,"It's cute, but...","It is very tiny and cute, and it fits pretty much everywhere. I don't have the problems with the wand that others do; my main beef with this vacuum is that it doesn't really vacuum much. It will pick up most of the stuff on the surface of your carpet. But don't expect it to remove dust...and if you're allergic, you will have trouble with your little vac. It's otherwise ok."
4,Nice and easy listening,"I liked the lightness of this album, a bit far from traditional folk music but not too much. A easy listening album for everyone also not addicted to celtic music."
5,Absolutely Fascinating!,"This book is a fascinating read. The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation is a book which describes a universe which is infinite and unending, composed of energy and follows no mysticism, deities or chance but adheres to strict scientific laws. Originally written in 1956 as a series of lectures and letter compiled into this book it is still amazingly current. The author really dismantles religious beliefs and stresses a scientific approach to everyday living. Historic events, philosophical and moral issues are addressed in a relativistic manner and the author makes one think about good and evil in an ""Einsteinian"" framework. The author keeps challenging accepted beliefs and summarily shatters them, forcing the reader to really think about things . Definitely a must read if just to be exposed to a very unique and indeed refreshing worldview."
3,You get what you pay for,"These were cheap and get the job done, however they dont last long and seem to be of poor material compared to the ones with the rubberized coating. Just like anythingelse in life you get what you pay for."
4,Not the best I've seen but does the job,"I bought this to use with an old Duracraft evaporative humidifier with only NORMAL and HIGH setting. The humidifier sits on a stool in a 2nd floor laundry room that is 5-6 feet from a bedroom that has no room humidifier. The laundry room is right next to the master bedroom, but because of its size, we placed another room-size humidifier in the master bedroom but set it at the lowest of its four settings at night. With this set up, it's been comfortable in the both bedrooms and no-one has complained of dry throat yet. Our family has not had cold that got passed the irritating throat stage. While the filter certainly looks thinner than the ones we could buy when the stores still carried these older model of evaporative humidifiers, they are doing the job."
4,Fit my kenmore just fine,"Price is better then the department stores. With having a ton of cat hair in the house, the bags hold up just as good as the name brand."
5,Great Product!,"This works as good as the original, if not a little better. It states on the product that it'll last longer than the original. I just think it might. I've only had the filter installed about a month, but no worries so far!"
1,Low Price - Low Quality,"When using this filter in my Sunbeam SCM1762, the ""Filter Check"" meter nevermoves out of the 'Change Filter' area. Since the meter is actually a humiditysensor, it means the filter is not wicking enough water. The filter is alsomissing the plastic backing that was on the original filter.I will have to go back to the more expensive HWF62/SF212 filters."
4,HWF62 Holmes Humidifier Replacement Filter,Product is great - the shipping was ridiculous. I highly suggest that you purchase a humidifier that is filterless.
3,Not really a holmes filter,I was disappointed to receive this item and it was a different brand than Holmes. I have not used it yet so I don't know how it preforms.
1,RM WI,"Received filter in timely manner. However, upon installing it there was a strong stale odor that of course got blown throughout the room so I had to take it out. My humidifier is relatively new and quite clean and clearly the filter was the source of the smell as when I took it out it went away (but stayed with the filter when I tossed it). It's possible I got a bad one but I will not be buying this product again."
2,"This is a very cheap knockoff, not Holmes like the byline.","I don't know who manufactured this filter for this seller, but they look real cheap and come in a cheap plastic wrapper. They don't even look like the picture. I'm trying the first one tonight, but I'm disappointed to see how cheap these look. I bought 4 thinking that if they were on Amazon they should be somewhat legit."
1,This is not the product pictured,WARNING--this is not a genuine Holmes humidifier filter. The product information was misleading. I am very disappointed.
3,It's a paper filter,"You would think that in the 21st century a more advanced humidifier could be developed that doesn't need a paper filter to wick moisture into the air-------well this primitive technology is what we have! and a mold prone paper filter is what you need, and this was about the cheapest!"
2,filter,"Well, I got the filters very soon after I placed the order.That's nice. I just opened the package a couple of days ago because I have been moving. I ordered 5 filters, but there are only 4 in the package :(I guess the seller didn't pay attetion when they put it in. Hope it won't happen again."
3,Humidifier filter,"While not exactly the filter I was looking for, this one will serve the purpose of putting some humidity into the dry winter air in my home."
1,I don't believe a word from these people,"I'm sorry Terri died and I feel very bad for the family, but these people are caught up in the media soap opera and their hatred for Michael Schiavo has taken over their lives. I know they wanted to be with Terri when she died. Maybe they could have been if they hadn't been in a bitter feud with her husband leading up to her death. This situation could have been handled so much better than it was. Was it Terri's wish to have her family saying such awful things about each other? I don't think so. These people, and a ton of media people, owe Michael Schiavo an apology."
5,"Buy the book(s), get the FACTS, ignore Michael's continuing hate campaigns & it's obvious","I received an advanced copy of this book and found it compelling for its rigorous honesty. FOR THOSE WITH THE COURAGE TO HEAR THE FACTS, it reveals the heartbreak of a grieving family whose loss is unforgiveable. This book is best combined reading with SILENT WITNESS by Mark Furman (available right here on Amazon.com). GET THE FACTS. Be your own jury. Michael Schiavo's accounts appear like swiss cheese-lots of holes. It was amazing having all accounts available. The stories are different, just don't fit. Michael's new book hardly touches the facts. It's all public relations, in my opinion. READ THE BOOKS. GET THE FACTS. The lesson is that we need to pay more attention to the FACTS. God Bless Terri. She left this earth WAY TOO SOON, per the FACTS!"
1,"Thumbs Down for ""Terri's Family""","Anyone gushing over the ""concerned and loving"" parent's of Terri Shiavo really needs to read Michael Shiavo's book on the life and death of his wife. Unlike ""Terri's Family,"" he uses real documents, court and hospital records to support his case. He also exposes the Shindler's (in particular, Bob), as being much less concerned with their their daughter's treatment and more more concerned with affording a bigger condo.Terri is finally resting in peace."
4,A Life That Matters,"After following the Terri Schiavo story for many years, this book was a must read for me personally. It is a very sad account of caring, loving parents who had to endure the unthinkable. I feel that the book was written in a very professional manner and would recommend it."
1,Facts?,"Facts: 1)Michael Schiavo never kept any of the money from the malpractice suit.2)Schiavo became a nurse to look after Terri and looked after her for years. 3)Terri's cerebral cortex was destroyed, she was blind, and half of her brain was gone. 4)Terri's parents praised Michael during the malpractice suit. 5)Terri's brother, Bobby, never went to visit Terri for years. 6)There's no proof, no evidence, that Michael did anything to abuse Terri, or cause her condition, or that he was an abusive husband."
5,Life and death,Excellent read. I had no ides what the real story was. We only hear what the media wants us to hear.
5,The truth the media failed to mention,"""A Life That Matters"" gives great insight to the Terri Schiavo case giving details that the media choose to omit. I think the bottom line, regardless of your view on euthanasia, is that here is a family that just wanted to take care of their daughter. The fight they had to endure and the unbelievable injustice system they had to face and ultimately lost to in the end should be a scary wake up call to the rest of us."
5,Clean & Clear,"I like this product because it cleans thoroughly and leaves no film on the surface and smells fresh too. It is also great for the patio furniture surfaces, as well as our outdoor kitchen."
5,My very favorite,This scent combination is fantastic. I love that my whole house smells of pine and lavender after cleaning with this! It really does inspire you to clean!
5,Great,Smells AMAZING....did i say AMAZING!!! Lol. And works great and shipping fast! Only problem is running out and having to use pinesol while wairing for my new bottle of caldrea!
5,typical Hiaasen,this is another in Niaasen's series of goofy people and circumstances..I am a big fan of his and get a chuckle from all his books..
5,Native tongue,this is an extremely funny and good book. I really like his style of writing. I will read all of his books.
1,Was he awake?,"If this was the first Hiaasen book I had ever read, I suppose it would have been interesting enough. But (and there's always a 'but') having read several others I found it to be formulaic and predictable. C'mon Carl...you can do better than this. Much better, I'm sure."
4,A good one,"Interesting premis and a good one by Hiassen. I have read most of his stuff and I would rate it this one in the middle ranking of his books. Nice to read about Upper Key Largo, with Ocean Reef Club, Alabama Jacks and all the card sound places that I love along with the desolation and beauty of Upper Key Largo and Carysfort Reef."
4,Classic Hiaasen,"Enjoyed the book and his characters. A Classic Tale by Mr. Hiaasen. The ""Govenor"" once again comes through. Mr. Hiaasen has a unique way of bringing you into the story. Being familiar with the landscape of South Florida also helps to bring the stories to life. Well done Sir."
2,Bogs Down After a Good Start,"The first 50 pages or so are indeed laugh-out-loud funny. The next 50 are okay. But then it really bogs down, goes around in circles, starts repeating itself, and just gets dumber and lamer. Hiaasen is a great writer and humorist but he just ran out of steam and ideas on this one. By the end, you just want it over with. All in all, not among his best."
5,Great Carl Hiaasen,"You know, when an author puts out a number or series of books, there are bound to be favorites. Unrelated, I always found Robert Parker's ""Searching for Rachel Wallace"" to be my favorite Spenser, Nelson DeMille's ""Up Country"" my favorite DeMille and my favorite Follet, easily ""The Pillars."" And this is my favorite Hiaasen.""Striptease"" is funny and in it's own way riveting as is ""Skin Tight."" But ""Native Tongue"" raises the bar on well written wackiness. I would tell you about the plot but I'm not sure there is one. Just watch Joe Winder, a frustrated Carl Hiaasen in his own right, and wait for the appearance of Governor Skink. That's ex-Governor Skink. 5 Stars. Larry Scantlebury"
4,skink rides again,I loved the characters as much as I have in his other books I have read. A lot of fun.
3,VERY FUNNY,"There is no doubt Carl Hiaasen is hilarious. In fact, he may be the funniest man writing mysteries. This is by far his funniest book, and I've read them all. The only catch, he's a bigot of the worst sort. Under the guise of attacking special interest groups and racists, he shows the same narrow minded, arrogant and at times extremely misinformed opinions about anyone or anything that doesn't agree with his political views. And be assured they are extremely liberal. So it's Carl's special interests vs. other special interests, and what's the difference? I think my biggest concern is he clearly advocates terrorism or vigilantism to accomplish goals. Nonetheless, the guy is damned funny, very clever and an excellent read. Just search between the lines, it's so typically liberal and transparent, with the end justifying the means."
2,"Humorous, but too many errors","I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of. In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms. Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books. But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again. The hermit in the woods that knows everything. State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies. Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position. It just seems a bit lazy. I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.I should mention that I didn't actually ""read"" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version."
2,"Lagging and preachy, but it's still Hiaasen","Native Tongue is a bit too preachy and a bit too boring for my tastes. I'm an armchair Hiaasen fan--he's a good writer, one of the better ones, but what seems fresh in Skin Tight and Double Whammy becomes recycled and dull here. Even characters are recycled, and not in a sequel-friendly way. And, of course, we can't have a true Hiaasen classic without a lot of heavy-handed anti-developer strains throughout. Still, the book is enjoyable and the characters descriptive, but the whole thing should be taken in a quick-read fashion--think of it as literary junk food."
2,More like Hiaasen-lite,"Dang, Carl, how could you?Let me start by saying that CH is one of my favorite writers. His stories aren't necessarily epic in nature but his dialog & characterizations & writing in general are virtually beyond reproach. Even though his storylines border on slice-of-life rather than edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Hiaasen's writing is typically so good, his books are still extremely entertaining page-turners.That said, Native Tongue was quite a letdown for me. Usually I'll finish a book like this in one or two days. I struggled for almost two weeks to finish it, putting it down at the drop of a hat.In his defense, this was one of Hiaasen's earlier efforts. Everything since Native Tongue has been infinitely better. If you're new to Hiaasen, don't let this book turn you off. His other works are definitely worth reading."
5,Lots of Fun,"A lot of fun. Usual Hiaasen nonsense with hilarious characters, a reasonable plot, and biting satire about everyone that lives or visits Florida. The main character is a suffering PR guy who rebels against a crooked Animal Kingdom park and his girlfriend who works in the phone-sex industry but fashions herself a poet. Then there is the Ex-Mafia guy running the park trying desparately to compete with Disney World. Includes crazy ex-governor living off snakes in the swamp (a great character who appears in other Hiaasen books) and a wacko elderly environmentalist who reacts violently when she gets annoyed. I give this novel a 9 out of 10."
5,Hiassen outwrites Elmore Leonard,"If you like scams and cons, warped characters and cynical heroes, you'll love ANYTHING that Carl Hiassen has ever written. His cast of zany characters, for example the one time Florida governor who walked away from his post to live off the land and chew on roadkill. If you are looking for a book that is a hoot, Native Tongue is a great place to start. There's plenty of action, clever dialogue, and tongue-in-cheek parodies of Disney World that will satisfy the strongest Southern Baptist Boycotter. This book will thrill chill and amuse you."
5,Florida - a place to be missed,"Hiaasen tears apart the bone and fibre of this state that dangles on the USA land mass in more ways than one. Funny, more than funny, sadly hilarious. Swamped in FLA charm."
3,Fun But Dopey,"After years reading the works Donald Westlake, I branched out, first to Elmore Leonard and now to Carl Hiassen. This work is fun until the strangeness and the improbability of the story bog down the last 50 pages. Hiassen is a slightly better wordsmith than Leonard, and the Florida setting is more vivid than any setting that Westlake uses. But based on this first voyage to Hiassen's world, he's not quite as good as the others. The humor is not as sharp or ironic as a Westlake tale, and the bad guys are not as fun to watch be torn down as in either a Westlake/Stark or a Leonard.Still, there are worse ways to spend a rainy day, and I suspect I will give a few other Hiassen works a try until the next Westlake book comes out."
3,"Take it from a Brooklynite transplanted to Florida, Hiaasen is on the mark.","Carl Hiaasen is a one-of-a-kind, social satirist cum activist. His books ARE Florida today. ""Native Tongue"" does it again. Right on the mark with rapier wit, juggling what seems to be too many characters, too many subplots, and having them all land right back into his pockets with nary a miss. A very entertaining, spot-on satire of just what's wrong in Florida (and probably everywhere developers roam) today. A true, breezy read of a hit."
4,An entertaining and easy to read book.,"Hiaasen has another good book here. The book is revolves around Joe Wilder and his PR efforts for the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills theme park in the Florida Keys.As always there are unseemly characters abound. And Joe takes us through a rollercoaster ride of fun and games as he tries to bring down the man behind the carnage.The book is well written and easy to read. Parts of it had me laughing out load while I read, making my better half think I'm a little cuckoo!Over all I found this to be a very enjoyable and funny book."
5,Guarare - The Best Orch. ever made!,"This is surely one or the best latin record ever made. It's arrangements say's it all . Born from one of the best latin musicians named "" Ray Barretto"" and named after the big hit "" Guarare. There hasn't been yet a band that could challege the Guarare Orch. Also I think that it's a bit ashamed that this Cd hasn't been yet released !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,These Are Not Waterproof,"I bought these socks in hopes that they would keep my feet dry. I am a caver, and bought these from a caving web site. I came out with my feet soaking wet and not from sweat, I wasn't hot at all. I bought the gloves also and I felt the water seeping in as soon as I put my hands in water. I don't know how they can claim what they do as these just plain don't work.I contacted SealSkinz 3 days ago, I wrote them the next day also. I still haven't heard anything from them. Their web site said to 'please allow them 2 days'. These are guaranteed waterproof. So, I guess their customer service is moot also."
4,Good Stuff,"It works, water up to my ancles for 12 hours and it did its job.For the military folks, in Field Training Exercises, good stuff."
1,Doesn't Work,"The box these socks come in, says fully immersible. As it turns out, so are the socks I wear every day. When I immerse them, my foot gets wet. That is the same thing that happens with these. I went in a spa pool with these on and when I came out, my feet were soaked. I wasn't in that long. If you need to keep your feet completely dry, these will not do that. On the same order, I bought a sock cover that you pump the air out of with a little hand bulb pump. I went in the same spa a day later with the rubber deflated sock cover and my foot came out completely dry. I then used it to go swimming in the ocean. Completely dry! They work great. The product here does not begin to work."
2,fits but stinks,well it fits and works fine but it has the worse smell ever.... i literally opened the box it came in and immediately had to set it outside on my porch...i left it there for 3 days and it still has a horrible smell...cant even put it in my car because it smells so bad.
3,Seller didn't expedite,"Flag was decent quality, about as expected for the price. Arrived too late for my world cup party, even tho I paid for 2nd day air. I guess I could have requested a refund but it seems like too much trouble."
2,"Large and Cheap, but poor qaulity","When I got the flag I was shocked by just how large and cartoonish the signa of Spain was. It almost looked like a child's toy drawing. The yellow and red displayed on the picture was completely untrue- the red is almost a rusty orange, and the yellow is pale. The whole flag is very see through. If I had gotten the chance, I would have spend more money for a more nice looking flag. Large and cheap, but the quality is so poor it's not really worth the purchase to me."
5,Great Buy,This is the best way to learn the Bible the voice is pleasant to delivers the Watch Word Bible well
1,COMPLETE WAISTE!!!,THIS CD IS NOTHING BUT NOISES WITH MINOR APPEARANCES OF MUSIC WITH ZERO LYRICS! I LITERALLY THREW IT OUT MY CAR WINDOW WHILE DRIVING. I AM SO DISSAPOINTED IN WHAT USED TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE BANDS. I FEEL COMPLETELY VIOLATED WITH NO CHANCE OF GETTING MY MONEY BACK!!!
4,A good giude for New York diving.,"Gentile is an accomplished diver and this book gives an excelent historical account of the sinking of the most famous N.Y. wrecks. Gentile also leads off each wreck story with a basic data list including Loran coordinates for each wreck. Each story ends with a discription of the dive or rather the condition of the wreck when the book went to print. This is the only area where Gentile could have given a bit more detail, but all in all, a good book."
5,The funniest writer I have read in a long time.,There are serious columns in the book. The humorous ones are what made me read the book again. The chapter on the Olympics is the funniest thing I have ever read. Anyone who thinks Reilly is boring has no sense of humor.
5,"unique, emotional, personal and powerful bluesfolkjazz","I first came across a 1971 Ellen McIlwaine vinyl album, in London in the early 90's (into 'rare groove' ) Apparently, it was also the dawning of the continual dawning of the 'Age Of Aquarius'. hearing her music for the first time was the coolestthing. Her unique emotive vocal an intimate and powerful voice coupled with her mad slide guitar make her truly unique. She recorded 3 (?) albums on Polydor, but was never as well known some of her peers who highly respected her style- including Tim Buckley and Jimi Hendrix. female vocal folk - jazz - blues-slide with inuit vibes covering songs by Albert King, Jimi Hendrix, Blind Faith and traditionals- Wade In The Water. Spiritual.this I highly recommend to all musical souls."
2,We don't like this walker very much...,"Our daughter received this walker as a gift from her grandparents, without consulting us her parents, first. I would not have chosen this walker. Now 14 months old, she has never voluntarily pushed it around. The songs are annoying, loud (the 2-level volume switch doesn't make much difference) and often begin spontaneously if the walker is left on. The motor on the ABC wheel is sounds like it's grinding and the wheel comes out of place easily, whirring loudly, not spinning, until fixed."
4,LeapFrog = Only Way to Go,"After not enjoying the Gobble & Go Hippo by FP, we decided to see if Leap Frog had a walker... sure enough. And we really like it. Sure, the songs can be repetitive, but really, what child toy doesn't have this distinction? This walker is fantastic because it's sturdy enough for our growing young one to pull himself up on... and he can easily push it whichever way he wants, the toy is constructed so that he doesn't HAVE to use the red handle if he doesn't want to.You'll want to carefully supervise your young one at first as the toy can go a little quick for learning walkers. After a few hours of play though they'll get the hang of it.And yes, sometimes the toy will suddenly start playing the song for some reason without being pushed.But overall, a great educational toy from LeapFrog once again."
1,Don't Buy It! Frustrating Toy!,"Save your money! Here are the problems: 1)clunky and heavy to push (difficult to turn for a child) 2)frustrating for child b/c not much 'hand manipulation' -- In other words, other toys gratify a child's need to push buttons/see a reaction-- the only thing a child manipulates is the 'yellow horn' button which just shows 3 shapes. My son broke it b/c he tried to turn the wheel and push the piano buttons--these are not meant to be pushed! 3)Poor 'wear-ability' -- In other words, it broke quickly for a toy. Now the music sounds like an old broken record (seriously). 4)It uses up battery power quickly, too! INSTEAD--We got the Fisher Price Brilliant Basics Musical Activity Walker--GREAT BUY! LOTS of items for hand manipulation, EASY to push, for baby AND toddler use, and fun with or without batteries!!!"
1,This Product is Sub-Par at best,"The wheel on the product makes a grinding noise that easily overpowers the music and the music itself is terribly annoying and resets everytime your child hits a button making it cut into the words that are supposed to be teaching your child things! Not a bright idea Leap Frog! Also, I got this for my son when he was almost 1 for Christmas last year and when he would pull up on it, it would take off going forward leaving my child on the floor behind it wondering what the heck happened! This toy is already broken and it isn't the fault of me or my child, it is the poor workings of the wheel. It refuses to spin after changing batteries, cleaning the battery ports with an alcohol pad, and other suggestions from leap frog support. NOT recommended, try at your (and you child's) own risk!!"
2,False advertising,"Well, it looked great in the store, but wasn't what we were looking for. I am actually bringing it back today to get a refund. The sound tracks are great. The music is pleasant and upbeat, but you can't really ""play"" with it. It really only works when you actually push it, and when you sit with it your play is limited. I'm glad others are enjoying it, but I felt we did not get our money's worth, especially since it's not that sturdy and moves really fast."
2,Too Fragile,"My son received this walker for Christmas. It is a good walker because it allows plenty of room for his feet between the wheels. But as a toy, this thing doesn't hold up. Unfortunately, my son likes to spin the alphabet wheel which initially just worsened the sound quality but has now completely jammed up the songs. We don't even bother turning on the sound anymore which is a shame because when it worked, it was fairly enjoyable (especially the trumpet). This thing lasted about 1.5 months. Not good enough for a toddler's toy."
4,Very helpful in balance,"This walker has very little horizontal resistance on the wheels so it was very good at teaching the baby to stand and walk using the toy minimally for support, as opposed to the lean and push as we found with many of the walkers. It took two days to get used the change having to balance but now she loves it. She also likes to play with the toys on the front."
3,Not bad for my 1 yr old.,"My 1 yr old enjoyed it right away and was happy with it, being able to pull herself up and take a few steps. Only thing she didn't like was not being able to turn the toy to where she wanted to go.About 6 months later, she doesn't play or use it anymore as she is now, on the move."
2,Not worth the $,"This toy is not worth the money, there isn't any interactivity with the toy at all! The front looks like there are lot of things to push, it is misleading. The only interactivity is rotating the little ball on the side with the shapes on it. The rest of the movable parts only move when the walker is pushed. It's probably a good toy for some, but my son MUCH prefered his Little Tikes Push & Ride Racer. This item doesn't interest him much, not worth the money for us. But each kid is different."
2,"Not a play toy, just a walker assistant","I wanted to buy a toy to help with the next stage, walking. My son is 8 months old and is standing and climbing on his own. He used the toy to help him stand but then there was nothing else to do. He could push it but he was looking up the entire time not even at all the stuff going on down below. I didn't want to teach my son to walk with his head hanging down either.The toy really misrepresents itself when it says you can lay it flat so they can play. The toy offers no real interaction for the child, except the horn that can turn, everything else is activated when the child walks behind it. I was disappointed that the child couldn't even spin the wheel in the middle."
4,dance mood,"I purchased this item after seeing my nine month old daughter push our clothes hamper as if it was her walker.I was so excited that I bought her this band wagon.Instantly, when she heard the sounds play, she started dancing!We were so ecstatic to see her dance and move her body along with the music!She loves playing with it.It's a good buy for your children who are starting to walk."
2,not worth the money,"I am usually happy with the leapfrog toys but this walker could be better. As mentioned in another review the ""drum"" or ""spinning alphabet wheel"" only is supposed to spin when the child makes the walker move. My daughter also kept trying to spin the wheel herself and messed up all the songs. Save you money and buy a cheaper walker. This one just seems to be too be TOO fancy."
3,TOO FLOPPY,"I have had several mops on this order, this is the worst one I have had. It is too big and floppy, it is ok, but would not buy again, overpricedhhhhhh+++hhhhhhhh"
1,"12 ft. Swim and Play Splash Pool a Waste of Time, Money and Resources","Very inferior product. Paper thin vinyl liner of a gauge of vinyl that is much thinner than what is used on even the cheapest inflatable infant pools. Poor construction, appears to be designed to go straight to the garbage - or to encourage the consumer to purchase another pool after throwing money away on this overpriced one! Filter has cardboard like gasket. Filter and liner designed so you must cut a hole in the paper thin vinyl with a knife to create access for the filter on this round pool. Guess what happens next? Pool leaks and is not constructed well enough to withstand even gentle splashing and play. Metal surround is constructed of very flimsy metal with sharp edges - particularly those surrounding the filter access point."
5,Works great!,This item is a replacement in a condo that I rent out. The renters are very pleased with it - they say it works really well and is quiet.
2,"Good, but dated.","This was probably an excellent book when it was first written. The information is getting to be a bit dated. At least half of the hikes we have tried have had some outdated information.On one hike, the trail was nearly gone after what appeared to be years of no use. It would have been somewhat dangerous for us to continue the hike.I will probably throw the book away and get a more up to date one."
1,"Warning, Warning! Avoid this coffeemaker at all costs!","Boy, I sure wish I'd read these reviews before buying this ""coffeemaker"". I had the exact same problems as everyone else right from the start. No matter how much jiggling and wiggling I did, it constantly overflowed ... I had grounds in the coffeepot, all over the counter and in the water resevoir! The ""sneak-a-cup"" never really worked...I would take out the pot and it would just run even faster! What a piece of junk. I lasted about a week before I pitched the darn thing and bought a DeLonghi for just $10 more that I absolutely love!Save yourself the cost of the rolls of paper towels needed to clean up after each brewing session and avoid this coffeemaker!"
1,what a piece of junk,"this is a good looking pot with just the right features however it is a very lousy design. My problems are a filter arm that will not stay attached when you go to clean it or remove it from pot. I am constantly chasing the little spring down the sink, under the cabinets, under the stove or anywhere else that little thing can roll under. I have had B & D send me two replacements and they all stink! What a total waste of money. I will not buy B & D brand any time soon and most defently not with out reading reviews."
1,1 star for brewing coffee...,"I'm hoping I feel better after complaining about this coffee maker online,because every day when I get a second cup of coffee, the brew pause leverfalls off and I rue the day I bought it. At least it was a gift to my dad, so whenI move out in a couple months, I can find a new one for me that actually works!It has always made coffee, but frequently overflows if you don't position the potjust right so the lever unplugs the basket. I have also noticed water dripping outdown near the ON button. Believe me I will be doing serious research before buyinga new coffee maker. Who knew you had to?"
1,This is Black & Decker????,"This is the worst coffee maker I ever had the misfortune to buy. I bought the first one and after the second pot of coffee it just went on strike, refused to make coffee. I returned thinking it was just a defective unit, HAH! Nope, the second one's filter arm came apart as was mentioned in a review. Needless to say, I returned that one and took store credit to get something else and brought my old Proctor Silex out of the ""donate to charity"" box. It may look ratty, but it's worked for 3 years with no glitches. Don't bother with the Black and Decker, it's truly a P.O.S.."
1,HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,"My mother in law bought this for us as a Christmas present. It worked fine for about 3 days and then the problems started. I made coffee one morning and walked away. I came back about 3 minutes later to find coffee running all over the counter. I removed the pot from the burner to stop the flow and cleaned up the mess. When I replaced the pot on the burner, the same thing happened...I adjusted everything possible (basket, pot, etc.) and nothing stopped the coffee from spilling out. I still have no idea what happened. I emptied the pot and started over and it worked fine. Days later the pot began to leak constantly. Coffee drips when the pot is removed for pouring, the unit sometimes begins to brew immediately and other times it takes a few minutes to start. I am very disappointed since I have always had good luck with this brand. This thing is going in the trash and I will buy another brand!"
1,Piece of junk,"Coffee pot looks great and sounds good on paper, but the engineering must have been done by a group of 1st graders. When brewing, the drip part of the filter holder does not line up with the hole in the carafe, and the carafe does not totally engage the anti drain lever. This causes the coffee to not run out through the hole in the bottom, but rather overflows out the top. Also, if you pull the carafe out while it is brewing, it causes coffee to spill everywhere."
1,not working anymore,"i bought it recently and just used only 3 times not even for 2 weeks.i used it for last night again and it did not working at all, not heat come up even i already set up 480 temperature. i am really pissed off and wanna get a refund back"
5,"HOT TOOLS 1104 Marcel Curling Iron, Gold/Black, 5/8 Inch","I am a cosmetologist and I only use Marcel Irons.I was so thankful to know I could purchase on Amazon.This iron is fantastic!,It heats up quickly, it has a long cord and I use it daily at the salon."
1,This is by no means professional!,This is the 2nd Hot tools iron I bought in 6 months! There is a definite problem with the wiring at the base of iron. Twice this iron has had a short in the wiring. I will never buy another hot tool product again.
2,Hot Tools Marcel Curlling Iron,"I have been a hairdresser for several years, and I have found that the Hot Tools Curling Iron has gotten to the point the do not last even 2 or 3 months. There seeems to be a problem in their design of the wiring in the handle. It shorts out within a few months, and there is no way to repair it. I have now been looking at trying another company. The iron I just purchased lasted less then the 2mos."
2,ABBADO SE APLAZA,"Claudio Abbado da una interpretación muy floja a la partitura de Verdi, ni el buen elenco de solistas (la única que está mal es Edita Gruberova en el papel de Oscar, su voz sencillamente no es adecuada, para el personaje) salvan del aplazo a Abbado.Versiones que recomiendo: Votto/Callas (EMI) y Arturo Toscanini (RCA)"
3,Stick with the '57 Callas,"Overall, a disappointment when compared to the earlier mono recording of Callas, di Stefano, and Votto as conductor. For those who must have more modern sound, this is not a bad offering, given the reasonable price. But it certainly can't compare with the excitement of the older La Scala recording."
3,review opera CD,I did not receive a libretto with the CDs and therefore I have no idea what the opera is all about or what lyrics are being sung. With a libretto I certainly would have a better sense of what I am listening to.
4,Great Gift Item!,"I really enjoyed my La Flute Corks screw. It is easy to use, works great, and it is a very unique looking item. It is shaped like a wine glass, comes in nice wood box. Fun item!"
5,The REVOLVER Of Superhero Comics,"If the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee team was the Beatles of superhero comics, then this is theirRevolver [UK]. Kirby, already the most accomplished artist in comics, had the muse plop squarely in his lap and is at an absolute career peak with this run; Lee, smart guy that he is, had the good sense to stay the heck out of the King's way (or, as he does in some of my favorite bits, use the captions or Thing's dialogue to wryly comment on the proceedings). What else? I don't have enough good things to say about Joe Sinnott's inking (starting with issue 44) of Kirby's pencils here - after years of hit-and-miss embellishment, Jack must have been pleased as punch to have him on board.I have read these comics many, many times since I was a kid and have become, if anything, more impressed with them with each passing year. I literally cannot imagine a disinterested party not feeling the same way about the explosion of creativity going on in these pages."
3,This is NOT a MEN'S watch,"The watch is great for a woman or boy, but definately not big enough to be a man's watch. It shouldn't be advertised as a man's watch. We kept it anyway and gave it to my niece for Christmas because we didn't want to have to deal with sending it back. Don't buy this for a man or you will be disappointed!"
1,muff review,I was not happy with this muff for the following reasons:1) The cutout period seems long (~3 seconds).2) The cutout level seemed to ocuur at MUCH LESS than the rated 85db.3) The pass thru sound intensity was noticably different between the left and right ears - not balanced. (There is only 1 volume control for both ears.)4) Construction seemed cheap.Do not recommend buying
4,Not bad for the price,"These aren't the best ones out there, but neither do they claim to be. They work well for the price. I haven't had any problem with mine. The cutout works well. The level at which it cuts out is fine. I just use them for trap shooting. I would get better ones for hunting as these don't have enough adjustments. Overall, pretty good."
4,Great for the money,"It's not stereo audio so the world around you sounds like a mono soundtrack of itself, which is a kinda funky. Try walking down the street with them on for an odd experience!They work fine. I have a large head and ears and they got a little uncomfortable to wear after about an hour. 5 minutes off and I could put them back on, which is pretty good.The sound cut-out works very well for occational loud things like gun fire. In a workshop with heavy tools, it's a little less useful. But I like that I can put on all my gear, respirator, glasses and muffs, and I can hear the world around me by turning the muffs on. Then when it's time to work, I turn them off."
3,DDS,This game is good fun- its an intriguing world and rather good looking even though the story is a little predictable and the battle system can get a bit tedious- but THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH $100 in fact i would not be willing to spend more than $30ish on it THESE PRICES ARE OUT OF CONTROL
2,mind numbing,"If you are looking for a total dungeon crawl with random battles every ten seconds though endless dungeons that require mind-numbing repetition to finally work you way through, then this is the game for you!"
4,Pretty good though can get a bit annoying,"This is my second SMT game I've bought and it's pretty solid. The characters are pretty cool and the story is interesting and gets more interesting in the second game. The music is incredible and the game absolutely has one of my favorite game soundtracks ever. The gameplay is a bit annoying because of the frequent random battles and the LONG dungeons (probably the longest dungeons in an RPG I've played) and the battle system is pretty standard turn based overall (it's a bit different from the rest thanks to the turn icons in battle which can make battles sometimes strategic) so it's not super compelling but it gets the job done and some battles are more fun than the rest especially when you really get into them. Some battles are really tough though (mainly random battles) and require a bunch of grinding so that isn't so good either, but...Overall though, I'd recommend the game. It has flaws but which game doesn't?"
4,Good Entry Level Practice Shot Put,This shot does what it is supposed to do...has the weight and shape necesary for high school level competition. This was bought as a practice piece for my son primarily for home practice.
4,shot put simple and weighty,"It's as advertised, round and roughly made.It's not perfectly round and shiny like the expensive model but functional."
5,Very good Shot,"This Shot Put is exactly like the one i used for the past track season. Besides a few nicks here and there it was in good condition and arrived way before expected. This is a much, much better deal than $40 at every other store I've seen."
3,Unusual Romance,"I found this to be an interesting romance in that it mentions sexual abuse as part of some of the characters' stories, without getting too graphic. Her characters are colorful and she displays a good sense of humor throughout, especially in her ghostly hero, Jonathan.Darcy, her heroine, was raised by a stern but loving teacher, and Darcy herself has learned well. She is appalled by Jonathan's suggestion that she run a brothel, but she finds the ladies who work there aren't just prostitutes without morals; they're individuals who have minds of their own, and she wants to show them they are more than just what they do.It was a satisfying story with an interesting ending. Perhaps not the most exciting novel, but certainly pleasant to read."
5,Vader Pail is AWESOME,"The Darth Vader Trick or Teat Pail is just awesome! It's so cool, makes a great collection piece. The shipping was quick and item as described."
2,very small for trick or treating,"...My son got this for a 6th birthday present because he is all about Star Wars. He collects the halloween costumes for dress up! I thought that this trick or treat pail might come in handy at Halloween, but it will be VERY small to say the least. I would recommend it for a much younger child that only will go to a handful of houses. It also doesn't close very well at the bottom. It is supposed to snap shut, but doesn't latch very securely. It might have to be duct taped!"
1,2 books are the same,"I bought the boxed set, but i have 2 Active Directory book in the box set. The outside cover said network infrastructure, but the everything inside is Active directory."
1,Not good,"It was an old old movie and should not be offered. It was too dark to see at many times, and the sound quality was not good."
3,he is so cute,it was ok movie i mean it was good one but i loved watching Robert in anything he plays always love watching him
4,Not the best in the series but a good read.,"I loved the series so far, but the fourth book doesn't go very far in the saga. The series is awesome and the author does a great job with the point of view in the book. Definitly a great read."
4,An exciting book with a another frustrating ending!,"Well Sharon has done it again! ""Betrayals"" is a great book with lots of action this time! The characters of the ""other"" blending-now the Seated Five,are really involved as well and you can easily see the fifth book leading to a climactic finale. Be prepared-you will be hanging on after reading this one too!"
5,Another great book in the Blending series,"After FINALLY getting my hands on the 4th book, I tore through and found myself to be as totally enthralled as I was with the first 3. (And the ending wasn't as totally gut-wrenching as the ending of Challenges.) Now, if Avon would print up and release the 5th book, which is already written, I'll be set!"
2,"Betrayals, The Boring","The first book in the series started out great. The second book was not so great. The third book was downright bad. This one is simply poor. There seems to be a trend recently in SciFI and Fantasy to write more and longer pieces regardless of quality, just to collect more royalties. Unfortunately, this does not lend itself to good writing, and good writing is what science fiction and fantasy are about."
4,OUTLAW AT HIS BEST,"THE NEWEST MEMBER OF THE OUTLAWZ SHINES IN HIS SOLO RELEASE. TRACKS LIKE SERENADE MY LIFE, DIRTY DANCING, AND C'EST LA VIE MADE THIS ALBUM ONE U JUST HAVE TO GET. I WISHED THA OUTLAWZ WERE ON MORE TRACKS BUT OTHERWISE GONZOE WAS BRILLIANT ON HIS OWN!"
5,a gem,"My daughters are now 13 and 17, and over the years I have read quite a few books on the topic of parenting and spirituality. The only other book that I have read that strikes a similar deep chord is Andrew Murray's book, Raising your Children For Christ. I am purchasing several of these very readable, soul-stirring, illuminating books, two for my daughters, and the others to give away to moms needing an infusion of grace and insight. I wish it was around 17 years ago. Thanks for writing such a lovely book Ellyn."
4,tito's finale,"A hard to find gem this was to be the fantastic Tito Rodriguez's farewell performance. He died of Luekemia a few months later. The band is made up of the great Machito orchestra's musicians and you can tell Rodriguez was saying his goodbye. No liner notes, but the usual superb vocal stylings and and Salsa the way it should be served-caliente."
4,A must for Tito fans,"If you are a Tito Rodriguez fan, and if you enjoy the best merger of Mambo-Jazz-exquisite vocals, you will search this hard to find final recording as Tito passed only months later-too young at only 51. No liner notes-as usual-which is a shame- but the recording sounds like the Jazz musicians from Machito's superb band were with Tito as he sang and played timbals well, and thanked his legion of fans. Ricky Martin is great, Tito Puente was great, but nobody could sing and lead an incredible hot band the way Tito could. Someone needs to make his life into a movie, and soon."
3,Fools Knuckleheads,"I have a venerable 21-year-old car. The older the car, the easier to steal. Any item (among the several I employ) that makes a potential thief think twice is good in my book. At night the flashing light looks as though it might be the real deal. (My lighter works without key switched on -- duh.)"
1,Doesn't work,"Lets get this straight to the point. This cheap fake alarm device only operates if your car's battery power is on. I'm saying the light will only blink if your key is in the ignition, for example, when your driving regularly. Doing this defeats the purpose of having a crime deterrent when your vehicle is not in use. What a piece of junk, at least I wasted only a dollar + 3$ shipping & handling.DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Great practical joke gift,"Item only ""flashes"" when car/battery power turned on. Key must be left in ignition with engine and/or battery power on for unit to flash.Not a deterent for auto theft, but an invitation to car thieves""to steal this car with the flashing red light,"" as the keys will be in the ignition if the unit is ""flashing.""Truly, a worthless product, but great practical joke gift.Doc"
4,"Gugu is represnting Dallas, TX and is about to blow up!","I am reviewing ""Gugu Presents Redrumm's Killa Klique"". This album was really tight, but you also need to check out his last CD entitled ""Repent Tha Album"". Some of the tightest songs on ""Killa Klique"" are Money Makin Anthem (Revisited), Serious, Lord's Prayer, Zone Meditation, Happy Feelings, Project Dreamz, Hoe Bashing, No Luv At All, Everythang, & Money makin Anthem (Original). ""Gugu Presents Redrumm's Killa Klique"" would be a great purchase for anyone who likes that Down South sound.Also, for more information on Gugu, go to his web site , they have pictures, news, release dates, and sound clips of Gugu."
4,Just beautiful,"So I bought these for my niece for Christmas, but am totally tempted to keep them for myself. They are very nice and solid in the back, so a good weight to them. I haven't tried them on yet, but I really like them."
2,Nurses shoes,I bought the shoe for work. I was looking for a non-slip shoe which it is. The shoe has very little cusion or support.
4,Who is G La Beaud ?,"Another Personal Favourite Cd that i was introduced to by Cdbaby.com !At first i used to think it's all about the lyrics that makes a Good singer but proven wrong in this Cd. On The G is a very Good album no Doubt 'bout it ! Somehow i Missed Big Bub then came G La Beaud, i was like this is Good album, 'N i gave it a lot of Air play whenever i played Night slot ! So take it from me there is still Room for Growth but it's worth every Penny !"
3,A great insight into the mind of Trent Reznor,"This Star Profile of Trent Reznor is a must for die-hard Nine Inch Nails fans. This package comes with an Audio Documentary CD with many Trent Reznor interviews as well as a synopsis of his musical career by a narrator. It also includes a vividly colored 100 page book filled with pictures of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails, and a biography of the man behind NIN. This package is an excellent medium into the mind of Reznor, and gives us an insight into the searing psychosis that is Nine Inch Nails, and the man who brought it to the front of the music scene. While it contains so songs, and may dissapoint casual NIN fans, die-hards and NIN collectors will love it."
3,Trewnt Weznor?????,"I really like this CD, but It really annoyed me that they couldn't get someone to pronounce the name correctly. I was delighted to finally be able to hear his voice, since he is a very discreate man, and I don't get to hear much about him. The interviews were great, but the announcers voice really got to me."
5,Top item on my list of holiday gifts,This is a lovely book about the relationships of both remarkable and ordinary humans and their remarkable and ordinary animals. I picked it up out of curiosity and bought another five copies to give to my animal loving friends as gifts.This book hightlights day to day life with the critters we love and that enrich our lives. The photographs are gorgeous. I would happily hang several in my home and I'm very fussy about art and photography. The quotes are apt and the writing about the humans and their relationships with their animal companions is evocative and delightful.This book has a prominent place in my library.
1,Completely Useless!!!!!!,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!! I'm sorry but all the ""GOOD"" reviews on here are bogus. I believe it is the company trying to sell their product. The real reviews are the ones telling you about the nausea and diarrhea with no increased libido. I wish Amazon could screen better to make sure it was REAL people trying the products posting their reviews. I completed a bottle even though it made my stomach upset hoping the side effects would pass but it never did and it didn't help my libido at all."
1,Fematril failure!,"i was very disappointed with this product , not only did it not work for me, i found it gave me headaches & nausea.The product does not mention side affects,so be warned it could be a waste of money!"
1,didn't do anything at all,"The fematril didn't increase my sex drive,,,, or do anything else for that matter.I was very dissapointed, and will try to return it if it hasn't helped when I finish the whole bottle. I am nearly done, with only a day left.I would rethink spending the money on this,,, but you never know if a product like this will help. I have heard that it works for some,,, everyones chemistry is different."
1,don't waste your money,do not waste your money on this product.it does not work and it has unpleasant side effects.
4,It does SOMETHING,"I have never done a review before despite buying tons of stuff on Amazon but I felt compelled to share my happiness with finding Fematril. I can't say that it was a magic jolt to my libido, but it definitely has NOTICEABLY enhanced it, and has It definately increased my desire and arousal, and definitely made sex more enjoyable.I didn't give it 5 stars because it has not increased the quality of my orgasms, however, I am still very happy with the product because simply put, it works. I was skeptical when I first tried it, but I'm on my 4th bottle now!I take 2 per day, which helps me stretch out a bottle more than the recommended 3 per day. YOu really do have to take it every day though, if i forget for a few days, it is noticeable. Try it!"
4,This product has helped mw with my confidence,My confidence level has sky rocketed. I feel sexy again. I'm more responsive to my husband. I even took up pilates so I can start wearing sexy clothes for him again.
3,I heard alot of great stuff so decided to try this...,I got through my first bottle of Fematril. I can say that it really did help in the bedroom. I felt more turned on than usual and my partner noticed an increase in my response to him.
1,Didn't work,I took this as instructed and did NOT notice any difference. But then I've tried several products that promise to improve libido without success. So either they are all a hoax or just nothing works for me. I am post-menopausal so maybe that has something to do with my lack of success.
4,Magic Potion,"Wow, can I just say I havent been this responsive since who knows when. Trust me, this works!"
4,"One word ""wow""",I wish I had found this product sooner. I have been with the same man for 34 years. I just went through menopause (ugh).I never thought my sex drive would hit a low point for this long. My gynecologist recommended Fematril. My sex drive is back in tact and I am very thankful for the recommendation.I hope this helps other women in a similiar situation.
1,just does not work!,"Like another reviewer, I read the reviews and thought maybe just maybe this would work for my libido. I used the rest of my friend's bottle because she told me it didn't work, and I thought sure, why not, body chemistries are different. Then I bought my own bottle. But nothing! It's been over a month, and my libido is far from feeling any different. What an incredible waste of money! I cannot recommend this to any woman looking for better libido, or orgasms! So disheartening."
3,I like this product I feel it is working for me,"Works well so far, the only negative thing I have to say about Fematril is that the delivery service keeps leaving it at my neighbors and fortunately they are trustworthy enough to hold it for me."
4,I didn't believe in supplements for this sort of thing but this really works!!,I love Zalestra. It gave me the sexual confidence I had in my 30's. I can honestly say that I fully thank this product for breathing life into my sex life.
3,Fematril Product,"I am still waiting for that earth shattering orgasm. My sex drive is certainly back, alive and kicking."
4,I have had great succes with this female sex aid,"I am very happy I found this winning product. I have gotten over whatever was holding me back from being responsive to any sexual advances, or even self inposing efforts to have relieved myself of sexual frustration. This product is highly effective."
3,Good product,I felt the aleviation of my menopause symptoms. I recommended it to my sister and friend.
4,A Useful book with one main problem,"As an artist with a lot of 2d experience in animation who needs to absorb several new animation programs quickly, I find this book very easy to read and well organized.There is one major problem though (actually, perhaps two).Key components of the book are the 'downloadable' files located at the publishers' site online (rather than on CD as with other computer books). Many of these files seem to be corrupted or do not open in a newer version of AI. In addition there appears to be no 'help' page or resource for this problem from the publishers. I am unsure how much I'll be able to learn here without being able to perform many of the examples and lessons featured in the book.I really want to like this book a lot more than I feel I am able."
5,"Great Gift, Seinfeld Seasons 1-7","Great gift, my girlfriend is enjoying it each night after work and very happy with my choice, thanks, Jim"
5,Great Viewing at a Great Price,"Even though I'm in Australia, I bought this item because of the fantastic price for my partner. The whole series cost about the same as the first two volumes cost in Australia.Seinfeld is a fantastic, hilarious show. We've been watching it every weekend since it arrived.Definitely worth the money :D"
1,A disappointing dud,"I have found Levine's Mahler to be of interest, but this is by far his weakest performance. Both singers are too operatic for this music, and the orchestral backing is lifeless. Avoid this one."
1,"A drab, lifeless performance.","More proof that James Levine is the most consistently overrated conductor of the last 25 years. He's been able to hold a certain New York job for quite a while, so really all the praise must be for his consistency rather than artistic depth. But then one listens to a recording like this, and the drab, lifeless, superficial musical mind of Mr. Levine becomes as evident as ever. We're talking about an absolute musical masterpiece, two fine singers, and one of the world's great Mahler orchestras and what do we get? A recording that could easily be mistaken for something on Naxos. Forgive my vitirolity, but it's disconcerting that standards have reached such a low point, even with Deutsche Grammophon. Hey, if all the notes are correct, it must be a great performance. Delete this one quick, DG. You already have a winner with Guilini."
2,a shame,"I give this production 2 stars because from a purely musical point of view, there is something to admire here. The orchestra is well handled, the vocal performances are fine and the engineering is well done. However the staging is a travesty. This opera is about the way that man is ""dehumanized"" by war and other harsh elements of modern society. I think the plot and music of the opera demonstrate this in a very convincing manner. I do not see that the replacement of the proper scenario of this opera with one which is simply absurd, and which features ridiculous costumes, pipes everywhere, pervasive images of human cadavers adds anything to it. I'd advise a pass on this one."
4,Ikon rocks,This hotpot works perfectly and quickly. It holds plenty of water. The only minor drawback is that the lid is a bit difficult to remove and put back in place. It looks great on my new granite countertop.
3,Ok Kettle,"The brushed stainless steel looks great and the design is great as well, but the water it boils have a metal smell/taste to it (this is dependent on personal tolerance) but i could not stand the it. This is definitely one of those form over function type of kettle that looks great sitting in the kitchen but cumbersome to lug around since it is very heavy to begin with (6 lbs without water.) Once the water is boiled you will need to be very careful in handling it, unlike plastic kettles, the entire body of the kettle is made out of metal and it is boiling hot. Imagine accidentally touching it with the side of your arm. Overall, probably the best looking stainless steel kettle that does what it advertises, but due to the metal taste/smell and heavier weight I would get a plastic kettle instead."
1,Great Unit,"I can't imagine a better kettle. I like the handle and the spout as well as the little lid handle that is an ""O"" that you can pull open with one finger. I recommend this highly."
3,Passable but dissapointing,"I didn't have to file the base of mine to make it fit, but I have heard of this limitation from dozens of other airgunners.My particular problem was with the adjustment range of the azimuth (left-to-right) setting. There is roughly 1/4 of an inch of adjustable range, which should be plenty, but when this sight is mounted to the right side of the receiver (the only attachment option) the centerline of the sight baseblock is offset 1/4"" left. That means to zero, I had to adjust the aperture 1/4"" right, which is the whole range. Now I won't be able to add right if I need to in the future.For now, I'm zeroed, and so I guess I have to admit that the sight functions. But it is disappointing that I can't adjust it in the future."
2,It's ok,"For some reason, this doesn't work too well for me, it feels the same afterwards even when I put a thick layer over my face.My skin type is kind sensitive and dry, so that's why I got this kind instead of the green one, but I am really disappointed at this product. So, give a WARNING, try the smaller size one before you get this large size..."
4,A Soundtrack in Search of a Movie,"This is a really fine CD of music that has passed the test of repeated listenings days after picking it up on a whim. The music featured on this disc harks back to the 1980's and must have been quite innovative at the time...clearly Synergy is the granddad of Juno Reactor and similar ambient electronica music groups (and is a distant relative of groups roughly contemporary like Tangerine Dream). All instrumentals here, folks, and heavy on the synthesizer; much of the album sounds like the soundtrack for an '80's science fiction movie that never was, and reminds me (nostalgically, yes) of the soundtracks for ""Tron"" or ""2010"" especially. A couple of the tracks veer dangerously close to the cheesy and sentimental for my tastes, but overall this is a CD of excellent music in this genre."
5,The james Brown Band,Ny father bought this on 8 track back in 1970. I loved this tape because it was jazz and funk and it showed off his musicians. Wish it was reissued on cd.
4,Great Britain Show,"I don't want to talk about the performance itself, which is already much discussed about in others' reviews. One thing I noticed was, why on earth were all the American audiences at JFK so dull?? It's painful to watch them standing around doing nothing. On the other hand, Britains were so great that day at Wembley, with the aid of perfect music. Sorry Americans, but it seems the capital of Rock music is located at the other side of the Atlantic."
3,A lot of music,"Very quickly...You get a TON of music for the price when the singers were in their prime!!The quality of the dvd is ok.Convienence is not so much if you dont like all the bands.There are a lot of parts of the dvd where the sound squeals because of the sound set up on stage not due to the dvd, which is annoying.Overall, worth purchasing if you are an absolute fan of the 80's!!"
3,Nice concert - shame about the sound quality,"I was disappointed like many others with the missing footage. I can live without the missing tracks.My main problem with this DVD is the sound quality, which is not good even for a live recording. They studio could have done better, but I get the feeling that no effort was done to ensure a quality transfer and some decent sound."
4,full nostalgia!,As a child I had watched on live television. I watched again after almost 30 years. full of nostalgia. (note: this product is 4:3 format. not 16:9 version)
4,"20 years later, glad I still have my tapes","After reviewing the listing of performances it looks like whomever was in charge of producing this release did not follow the official concert agenda and opted to not include all of the music. I'm happy that an official release is on the way but disappointed that more care was not taken to include all the music in the correct order and also when VH1 showed the ""10 years later"" there were some comments from the artists and also the fans like the girls with U2 that should have been included. It could be that the producers think 20 years later nobody will care but obviously they don't know how many of us fans of this event are out here. It could have been 5 or even 6 discs and cost a little more I don't think anyone would have minded."
1,just because,"i recorded the live aid concert on vhs. & I mean i was up at six am to catch it when it started in australia. inxs was the bomb. & I would have bought this disc if they included ""oz for africa' on it too. that was during the ""listen like thieves"" era (actually BEFORE the cd was released) not to mention a plethra of incredible talent all of which i'd love to have on dvd.& then to know that 85 other songs are missing from the dvd (of which i'm pretty sure i have on vhs still) it just kills me that someone sat down & decided what ""the masses"" would have liked to see. I'd be happier if someone just came out & said that they couldn't get the copyrights to the stuff. ok, i'm done with my ranting, thanks for the heads up. I won't be buying this until they include EVERYTHING damn it!"
2,i WAS THERE,"THIS DVD DOES NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO WHAT PERFORMERS PERFORMED, THIE DVD SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING ON IT AND I BET PEOPLE WOULD PAY ANY KIND OF AMOUNT TO OBTAIN IT. THIS WAS HISTORY IN THE MAKING AND THE NEXT GENERATION SHOULD SEE IT"
3,not a good CD but pretty cheap,"I actually bought this CD because I wanted to see Live Aid again and it was cheap. I wanted to see the FULL set from some of the artists that had some unbelievable performances (Queen, U2, Sting and Phil Collins, etc.). Instead, you don't even get a real full song from anyone on this CD. It jumps around to just excerpts of just a few memorable ones. It was annoying when you were not done watching one performance and it'll jump to the middle of another artists performance. Still, the full set was a bit more pricey and I did get to see some good moments."
3,A nice Live Aid recap!,"Okay I gave this DVD 3 stars because obviously it can't be as the Actual set which i am waiting for currently! I don't know why im reviewing this. It's a nice recap if you don't want to sit through 10 hours of 80's rock, Depressing famine reports (BBC thing) or the cars drive video! Both are too sad! Mind i'm getting the full set so whatever! Nice recap!"
3,BEWARE - LED FREE,I won't buy this DVD simply because it does not include Led Zeppelin's first live performance in 5 years - since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980 - and likely last ever as Led Zeppelin with Basist John Paul Jones.
1,Lame!,"Who ever put this together does not love music and was not there at the time of these concerts. My suggestion is: DON""T BUY THIS DVD!"
1,Live Aid--Il ove it but quality appalling,"Don't egt me wrong -- I LOVE this CD but the qualityof mine is appalling -- it is like real cheap radio. Problem is I cannot retuen it as I ordered it but gave it to hubby to give to me for our anniv...which just was.The DVD is great but the quality is really poor...like a scratchy cheap radio. I cannot return it to Amazon as the 30 day limit has expired ---lesson -- don't buy too far ahead.I usu am happy with Amazon and I understand their returns but really-- for a defective DVD just a month or 2 after the ""date""......I think this is really rank. I would order another copy and just eat the cost but what is to say this one will be OK??!!! I have tried on 2nd TV/DVD and friends' DVDs -- same result.Return yours if defective and if a gift, open and test first -- probably made offshore and we pay i guess. lesson - don't order too far ahead for gifts and test test test!!!!!pamm"
2,A Complete Mishmosh,"In 1985 Bob Geldoff got a bunch of really good artists and a bunch of really bad artists together for a concert to help Africas starving, a good cause but the concert has too many bad performances from the always bad recording artists like Phil Collins, Alison Moyet, Wham, Sade and Ultravox and not enough good performances from the always good ones like Sting, Queen, The Who and David Bowie. The result is that this (too pop) music concert is not worth owning unlike better concerts of multiple artists like Festival Express, Rock And Roll Circus and The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Its too much like Dead Aid then Live Aid."
1,Who screwed this one up ?,I can't believe Led Zeppelin was omitted. They did not sound up to their standards but it was better than nothing !!!
2,"so, we have to buy the english and american version?","THE AMERICAN VERSION IT'S POOREST THAN THE ENGLISH VERSION BUT HAS WHAT THE ENGLISH HASN'T...AT LAST ON DVD. ALMOST 20 YEARS WAITING FOR THE RELEASE OF LIVE AID, ONE OF THE BEST CONCERTS EVER IN 4 DVDS. IN THIS CASE, IF YOU WERE WAITING FOR THIS RELEASE AS ME, WOULD BUY THE 8 DVDS ( THE ENGLISH AND AMRICAN VERSION). I'LL GIVE THE AMERICAN VERSION 2 STARS AND TO THE ENGLISH ONE 5 STARS."
3,No Zep?,"Word on the street is Led Zep refused to let their performance be a part of this DVD release. I am still gonna purchase this baby. The Queen segment alone may well be worth it. Let's not forget Mick Jagger tearing off Tina Turner's skirt, Boomtown Rats ""I Don't Like Mondays"", Ultravox, Prince's video for ""Tears in Your Eyes"" and so much more.Sorry about the 3 star rating. I had to enter something."
4,live aid 85,"I didn't really know what to expect. I mainly got it for a file of music from the 80's. I was really surprised with the content of the disc in the set. A lot of memories came back as I viewed. I remember watching this when it actually aired. It was fun to watch with my kids who were babies at the time. I found they were not only interested in the music at their birth, but also the situation of the days, and awareness of the times when they were unable to yet comprehend life. My oldest daughter, now 25 was very surprised to see how real the issue of AIDs was even then. They've grown up with public awareness, and to come to an understanding of where this AIDs deal started enlightened her."
4,High quality for something 20 years old!,"The video and audio clean ups done make this package really jump out. I popped the first DVD and was blown away by the sound and crispness of picture. The indexing on the four disks is nicely done too - allowing you to jump to certain artists if you like or view the concert from a single venue of you want.Yes, there are performances missing, but the key identifying numbers for most artists are there. Plus, as the liner notes indicate, some footage was just plan lost over the years so it could not be restored.For a music fan of the time period, this is a nice concert package. I'm giving one to my brother for Christmas."
5,An Incredible Event,"It would have been great to have the entire London and Philadelphia shows, with all the technical and musical errors shown as part of this ""historical document."" This was a live show! Without Led Zeppelin and some of the the other groups, the Live Aid package is still an important collection that I feel is an essential purchase for any serious music fan. The entire world actually stopped, watched and listened on this remarkable summer day. I am happy to see that the profits from this DVD set will go towards charity."
1,mislead,I was led to believe that the dvd was was a condensed version fron the original dvd.What lost me was that they played parts of a song instead of a shorten version of the dvd. why would I pay to see bits and pieces.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM !!! WASTE OF MONEY !,I recently bought this item. Upon viewing them most of the songs were cut and just very few were full. Its like having a climax listening and then was suddenly cut of replace with another song. IT IS LIKE A SAMPLER !!!!
3,Marketing vs. History,"In the world of marketing vs. history, marketing will win out everytime. If you all buy the cut down version of this historic event within the next 20 years you will be able to buy the whole box set. I was truly looking to see the whole event in the order that it ran, but guess I'll have to wait a little longer. I have always wanted to show these young metal heads that Led Zeppelin did have a bad show, and that Sting used to be the best. No Jam reunion because Paul Weller knew it would overshadow the Style Council. If you could see the whole Style Council performance you would agree, or maybe not. The price alone is worth seeing U2 in all their glory. History will win out but I hope that I am not too old too care when it does. I suspect in 20 years it will be a Time Life series."
4,McCartney's mike on this time?,"I would love to finally own this concert and too bad Led Zeppelin pulled out. I hope this time McCartney's mike will be on - remember when he did ""Let It be""? Perhaps today's technology could correct this."
1,Live Aid DVD,Took an age to arrive and when it did it's come from USA as region 1 so it won't play in my DVD player. What a complete waste of money............
5,Live Aid,"Fantastic performances, fantastic sound. Have played the DVDs while entertaining and people become glued to the TV when watching the performances. Never new a concert video could be so great!"
5,Long time coming...,"For those of us who came of age in the 80's, Live Aid is one of those events that we all remember where we were when it happened. This DVD is worth more than nostalgia, however, as it catches many bands at either the apex of their careers (Queen, Sting, Duran Duran), or showing their great promise (U2, etc.) A must have for the ""Gen X"" (sorry to use that term!) collection."
4,Live Hair,"I was not lucky enough to see the concert when it happened, but am glad to be able to now. The music is great, but it's fun to see the hair styles - mullet city! My daughter and I think Queen steals the show!"
1,"I won't buy it, and this is why:","1. I was 12 when it was aired live on TV (on the Turkish state TV channel, the only channel available at that time)2. I actually recorded it on a Betamax video tape3. I don't remember where I stored the tape, but if I find it I will watch the show from that tape, not a b....rdized version from a DVD.4. At least it is complete5. If Mr. Geldof wants to avoid people making profit by selling bootlegged versions of this event, he should release the whole thing, unedited. People have a right to see it, or they will log on to a popular auction site that also has a link in Europe and purchase it.6. This feels like buying a vintage paper bill missing 60% of it.7. I protest Bob Geldof.8. I never liked him anyway - minus his performance on ""The Wall"".9. 80's ruled, and the era should be available to the new generations, not only to our memories."
5,Perfect,Brand New still wrapped in orginal plastic. No flaws. Well done will buy from this seller again. Plus it arrived very quickly!
3,Songs Missing,"I bought this DVD mostly for a few select performances. When I received the DVD and played it, I noticed several performances were missing. The one I really wanted was ""Cuts Like A Knife"" by Bryan Adams. I'm not sure why all these songs were cut, but I feel cheated. Live Aid was a great concert I and remember it well. I would love to relive it as it happened that day."
2,Better Than Nothing!!!!!,"I was extremely excited to finally find out that there was going to be a dvd release of the 1985 Live Aid Concert. When I purchased the dvds and then wathced them it brought back great memories but several of the key perfromances were edited or not on the dvd at all. Dylans and the Stones performance only contained Blowin in the Wind. Billy Joel, Plant and Page, and Waylon Jennings were not even on the dvd's. On the positive, there is the entire Queen perfromance which is worth buying the dvd's for and the great performance by Mick Jaggar and Tina Turner which was I think the highlight of the show. All the other perfromances are edited or missing songs to the best of my memory. The quality is medicore at best and the sound is not that great either but is better than nothing."
3,The best we can do?,"I was eager to see this DVD, because of my vivid memories of Live Aid. It's --well, it's a record of the event. But I can't help wishing the execution had actually reflected some consciousness of the importance of the event.Example: Eric Clapton makes one of his periodic returns from the abyss, and plays ""Layla."" The audio tells me that Clapton has really seized the moment, and is doing some extraordinary things. But what is the video telling me? The camera is sweeping the crowd. It's checking out the cute backup singers. And wow, look, it's Phil Collins on drums. Jeeez, who cares about Collins at this particular moment, show me Clapton. No, I can't say that the camera is never on him, but's really considerably less than half the number. The guitarist watching with me almost blew a gasket.And that's just one instance. If this is the best we've got-- I'm just sorry it is."
2,Lame. Why did they bother?,"The booklet claims that footage has been misplaced or lost or whatever. However, if you watch the way certain acts are edited it's obvious they had the missing footage, and simply skipped portions of performances instead of including the entire set. Secondly, it is inconceivable that there are no broadcast quality recordings of this entire event available. The notes would make you think assembling this DVD was next to impossible, but c'mon. It was 1985, not 1955. We're not talking about lost kinescopes here. No question, this is a scam to release a more complete set in a few years. All this on top of bland, amateur packaging... Yuck. Save your VHS copies."
4,great first symphony,"The two works that I liked the most deserve the four stars.These are the First Symphony by Ibarra, and the Son by Arturo Marquez. The First Symphony reminds me a little of the the Rite of Spring. Both works are loud and percussive."
5,Ambrosia's Best Work. Engineered by Alan Parsons,"One of my all time favorites! Very creative with a pleasing mix of multiple harmonies, a variety of string and percussion instruments and thought provoking lyrics. Alan Parsons works his engineering magic using leading edge technology of the times to create excellent sound quality. The band spent many hours experimenting with various sounds before laying down any tracks. An attention to detail you don't often see with today's artists. Album has a continuity throughout anchored by recognizable hits of Nice, Nice, Very Nice (inspired by writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr.) and Holding On to Yesterday. A must for the collector of timeless music."
3,modern refrigeration and air-conditioning,"Dear sir, I am instructor of refrigeration and air-condition I want this book"
5,Great background music,Bought it for my wife who heard it at a friends house. She loves it. It's great background music when you want to concentrate or read.
4,What I really though about the book.,"In the begining, this book was not as good as I thought it would be, but at the end, it turned out to be a great book. At one point you are wondering,""Where is this book leading me"", while at another point, you're wondering what will happen next. One thing I liked about the book was the authors word choice. It pulls you deep into the book and in some parts of the book there is great visualization."
5,A superb translation,"These stories translated in this volume by Ronald Wilks are really superb. When one compares the translation of ""The Lady with the Dog"" with the earlier translation by Constance Garnett, the differences are apparent. Please compare them. The Wilks translation is high quality beautiful English expression, it captures the mood and the ideas of Chekhov perfectly."
2,Include a lot of out-of-dated information,"Even though this is the 4th edition and was just published this January, I still found there are a lot of out-of-dated information in this book. The author has referred a lot on the very old system, such as 8086, 80286... but give very little information about the new systems. For example, the author even didn't mention the use of DIMMS in the memory chapter but solely mentioned EDOs or previously released memory."
4,The Ma & Pa: A History of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad,I found George Hilton's book to be an informative and invaluable referance for anyone interested in railroading or regional history. The Ma & Pa: A History of the Maryland & Pennsylvania Railroad guides the reader from the early days of local railroad thinking to the demise of short line passenger service along the eastern Mason-Dixon line. This book is also a nice read for anyone who may simply be interested in learning something about the region. I am happy to add this book to my library.
3,Yet to buy the perfect ball,"I like and use this ball a lot. The grip is great and the price was good. I am very particular about balls. The NCAA logo is too large causing a slippery spot. The ball seems a little light, a little small and not as bouncy as it should be."
2,Disappointing,"This book was so disappointing that I didn't finish it. The characters were poorly developed. As with so many science fiction and fantasy books, the underlying idea is good but the author doesn't carry it off. Janet Evanovich does much better with this kind of character."
1,"Story is awesome, preoccupation with sex stupid","The story itself was great. The preoccupation with sex deserves 0 stars, yes, a big goose egg. I know many can look past the sex, with Joanne constantly talking about guys butts, muscular bodies, the vividly pornographic scene with David caused me to have a very guarded view of the rest of the book.Note: If a pontential reader is looking for porn and wants to disguise it then this series is it. I decided to give Ms. Caine a second chance with Heat Stroke. It is worse... Ms. Caine, please leave out the sex or at least keep it to yourself and the series would be #1 best seller for a long time. Very original ideas."
4,Urban Fantasy Fun!,"I thought Ill Wind was a really absorbing page-turner. I've never read a weather-related fantasy novel nor a book with genies (the ""Djinn"") before so the subject matter was quite fresh. Yet, I wasn't very emotionally invested in the characters and some of the relationships in the book progressed too quickly for me. In the end, it wasn't the best book I've read in recent memory but it was a fun novel (perfect for a fantasy beach read). I've also heard that as the series progresses more depth is added to the characters. So, I think I'll have Rachel Caine's Weather Warden series in the back of my mind for books to read by the pool this summer. Recommended to urban fantasy fans!"
2,Got suckered in,"I read a short story by Rachel Caine that is a prequel to the Morganville Vampire series and liked it a lot so I tried this series. I liked the first book well enough, so I went and bought all the rest. What a waste. Each story seemed like more of the same, over and over, with the heroine making absolutely idiotic choices and never really DOING anything about the things that keep happening to her. Save your time and money and don't get started on this series."
5,One to buy and keep,"Fantastic - really! A great book, a great read, a real page-turner - one of those books where I rush to the end of a page to see what will happen on the next page. The premise is made believable (weather is caused by evil somethings, djinni can be sources of power to magicians - including weather wardens), a secret coven (?) of weather wardens, housed at the UN Building, really save the world - almost daily.This author makes her world and premises believable, her characters human (even the djinni), and the dilemmas truly frightening. As twists in the plot reveal new information and new factors they fit in nicely - no deus ex machina for this author. Lots of adventure, lots of risk, many moments of humor along the way, and a happy and tricky ending which I won't reveal.I will be watching eagerly for the next book in this series and will buy it on the spot."
3,A good urban fantasy,"This book sat on my shelf for quite awhile before I read it. I didn'texpect it to be very interesting. I mean it's about the weather.But I'm happy to have been wrong. This book is a good urban fantasywith all the elements that make that genre so appealing. There is abit more romance in this book than I really cared for. I would havepreferred some romantic tension that built over the course of theseries, but I still liked this book a lot.Sexual Content:Some coarse talk, and two sex scenes that while not overly graphicare still somewhat detailed."
3,"Good, just not great","It's a got a pretty good story..interesting, lots of action, variety of characters (with some depth)..but it lacked greatness for me.I skimmed a lot of the book because I got bored.For me, Joanne was missing some things in her character development. And the story, and how it unfolded just didn't 'WOW' me.I prefer her Morganville Vampire series."
3,Pretty darn good,"I hadn't read Rachel Caine before, so I wasn't sure what to expect out of a new author and a book based on weather magic. But I really liked this book! The writing was clear, the struggles were internal, and I learned a little something about storms. I look forward to reading more in this series."
4,****,"I love Rachel Caine, I have read all of her Morganville Vampire books and loved them, so I decided to give her Weather Warden series a shot. I am not disappointed. The beginning was a bit slow and hard to get into, but I new the author and waited it out. It got so much better with every page. I love the romance in her books, how it is there, but the story isn't consumed by the romance. I love that I can't predict what is going to happen next and there is always stuff happening, but not too much. I like Joanne, she has personalty, alot of leading ladies dont."
2,Just and introduction,"There are weather wardens and djinn, a runaway journey, chases, classic muscle cars and a Demon mark. The female protagonist, Joanne, is strong, loves cars and mechanics (thumbs up!) and seems to have a realistic view of the world. This creates a very promising plot, with action, battles and some romance. But in the end, it was missing something, maybe I just didn't sympathize with Joanne, or it was just a lack of more character's insights . Well, it's the first book of a series and I haven't read the others yet, so it really is just an introduction to the Wardens and djinns world."
3,Weather Witch On The Run,"Joanne is a weather witch on the run. She's being chased by her own people who want to destroy her. Most of this book is no action and a lot of talk. Joanne meets a hunky guy on the side of the road who she ends up traveling with. But he's not what he seems. She finds out that he's been following her.I thought the story was alright, but I didn't really feel the relationship between the H and h was developed well enough. Then ending get's summed up pretty well but there's a cliff hanger."
2,A Little Disappointed,"After reading the ""Morganville Vampire"" series I couldn't wait to get my hands on more Rachel Caine novels. I ordered ""Ill Wind"" to start reading the ""Weather Warden"" series. I found ""Ill Wind"" to be disappointing. Whereas I couldn't put the Morganville books down, I had to force myself to read this book. Maybe it was the subject matter that turned me off. The thought of a storm chasing someone around the countryside was more than I could wrap even my vivid imagination around. I'm giving up on this series but I will give the author another try on one of her series."
3,"Once it gets going, a pretty good book.","I took me awhile to get hooked into this book...but I did about half way through it. Not bad, not great, but a good story."
5,"Ill Wind (Weather Warden, Book 1)",This is one of those series you hate to have to set aside waiting for the next book.Rachel Caine really has to write faster.I recommed this to everyone.
4,A fun read,"This book was a welcome departure for me from the slew of textbooks I've had to read lately. It was a quick read, and kept my attention. Will be reading the others in the series."
3,"decent story, but...","In this day and age of many different types of fantasy the idea of special people being able to control the weather is unique. Ms. Caine is able to allow the story to flow and also able to keep me guessing about the deep dark secret of just why main character is on the run. Character development is good but my problem is I'm just not that wild about Joanne Baldwin. Story line was moving along nicely when the Djinn steps in and all of a sudden the story turns into a harlequin romance. I bought the first three books and so far the second book is starting out like a Danielle Steel novel, and I hate Danielle Steel! Hopefully I can get through this book without much nausea and last book will improve. Unfortunately I will not be buying any more of Ms. Caine's books."
5,Original and Amazing,"This book captures readers and sends them on a wild, fast-paced ride. I fell in love with the characters, the story line and the author all in one book. The rest of the books are just as good. ""Ill Wind,"" starts the series out with a bang! It's like no other book I've read before. It is completely original!Joanne Baldwin can control the weather (to some degree). Unfortunatly, due to a accident, she is on the run from the Wardens; those who control weather, fire, and earth.This book, some have complained, starts out too slow. I'll tell you striaght up, this book leaves you wondering. That's because Caine purposely keeps the full story of why she is running a secret for awhile. She keeps you wanting to read. If you aren't patient enough to read through and figure things out peice by peice, than maybe this book isn't for you.Anyway, I loved how this book was presented, and I love the story line. It just gets better, so don't stop with this book!"
1,"Storm Storm, (yawn) Storm Storm Storm","Yes, the word storm is mentioned 145 times in this book I checked. And described painstakingly each and every one of those times. Pages of storm description. Sigh.Combine that with a waffling character who is in love with Lewis, no wait! Paul er um no, that's not right either. Oh! a Djinn she met a whole day ago.Why oh why did I finish this book?"
3,More Like a 3.8....,"I have been reading all the other reviews about this book and the whole series, so I looked forward to reading it. I am sort of so-so about it. I am going to read the next in the series, but I am buying it used, and I am not sure if it is a keeper. So I am not sure how much of a reccomendation this is. Others seem to love the series,I am on a wait and see basis."
4,another fine criterion release,i love the story of st francis.. This is a fine black and white movie - one of Rossellini's better films of the period.. While it is not quite as powerful as 'Open City' it is a very important movie and deserves to be seen..
1,Disappointed,"After reading information about St. Francis, I thought that this DVD would be very inspirational even with subtitles. However, it was seem to portray the characters as too dimwitted to be taken seriously as spiritual examples. I believe that St. Francis left a greater legacy than that and I'm not even Catholic."
2,Check if Foreign Film,Check to see what language this is in. I think I returned this because it was in a foreign language.
1,Comparatively dissapointing.,"I don't know what other commentators see in this film. Compared to other movies of St. Francis, 'Francesco' for example, this movie is terrible. First of all, the acting is horrible. Second, the ""Flowers"" of Saint Francis that come out in the movie are fruitless when compared to other more subsantial themes from the book. The movie doesn't even develop the 'flowers' (stories) well. St. Francis is not even depicted as the humble saint he was, but rather, more like God himself. St. Clare is inserted in the film in a very odd and abrupt way, saying nothing but a prayer in mass. Also, the movie deals with nothing of St. Francis' pre-saint phase (granted, the book doesn't either). I can go on and on about how this movie is bad. Buy Francesco instead and learn more about St. Francis."
3,Life after Karajan and Solti,"It seems for reviewers here that for the most part only two great Ring Cyles exist-Karajan and Solti- and that one or the other must be chosen as supreme. That really is a shame.I find Solti's conducting rather obnoxious. Also, some of the great singers are past their primes. I understand the significance of the project it represents, but that does not make it the best.I once read a review that refered to Karajan's Ring as a ""Box of chocolates."" I think that description fits it well. Although It is interesting to hear an alternate interpretation, It often feels engineered.It's not all about studio recordings in perfect stereo. Although in poor sound, I prefer the Krauss and Furtwangler recordings. Or, for better sound, the recent Testement 1955 Kelberth. The Janowski Ring Cycle is also very good."
4,Karajan's conducting here makes Solti's conducting of the...,"...Ring sound amateurish. Karajan is a musical giant, a supreme musical intellect. Solti is a musical bully who has the nerve to get up on a podium and lord it over 100 musicians who are all far more musically sensitive than he could have ever been. If only Karajan had been teamed with Culshaw.....oh well...."
3,Partial set,None of the reviewers mentions that this 14 cd set contains NO LIBRETTO. Repeat: NO LIBRETTO. Please print this information. Otherwise somebody's gonna get burned.J.W.T.
2,Pathetic attempt,"I was so dissapointed by this Ring I gave it to Half-Price books. Karajan does not capture Wagner's spirit, and this seems a weak, watered down version of a truly great work that deserves better. There were a few good moments, don't get me wrong- but the overwhelming effect was not a recording of Wagner's Ring, but Karajan's. The casting chages so much that it gets annoying and you find the guy singing Wotan turn into Gunther. Better buy the Solti, Bohm, or even a Furtwangler Ring cycle."
5,Wagner is a great composer.,If u like Opera or Beethoven then U will like Wagner. His music genre where the Orchestra over powers the singers the opposite of Italian Operas is inventive. He also invented the hybird of Romantic music/ and Orchestral music. His music conveys pure emotion. I personally recommend all of his works.
2,"Good value, but poor sound quality","Although this is a good value and an excellent opera, the sound quality of this recording is quite poor, undermining some wonderful performances."
4,Happy with this figure!,"This figure was hard to come by in it's time and it holds up well if you're lucky enough to get one today. It has good detail on the scarred face as well as the Vader suit. The helmet fits decently enough and the right hand can be detached also. There is a big nostalgia factor about this figure too as it was the first Vader to feature a removable helmet and among the first Vader action figure that was more proportionately accurate. Previous Vader figures (and other characters in general) looked too much like Body Builders. It's really still a very cool figure although it might lack the detail of modern Vader figures,this figure was ahead of it's time so to speak and the success of it most likely led to the toy company going farther and trying to improve upon it. Very good figure still and for the price you can't beat it."
5,Very original . . .loved it!,"As a first grade teacher, mother, and grandmother, I have read many children's books. This one, in my opinion, is one of the most original and creative I've read. Not only does it entertain, but it sends the message to children that 1. It's normal to be angry. and 2. There are constructive ways to deal with it.The idea that it promotes children doing dangerous things is ridiculous. For pete's sake . . .look at the classics. Children know the difference!Without ""danger"" we would not have ""The Three Little Pigs"", ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""The Three Bears"" or most of the rest."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this at a used book store, no where did it indicate that there was a sequel, until the last chapter. Then I went out to find the sequel only to find it was never published (last chapter said ""Possession, coming in 1997."") Don't bother reading it, without the sequel available. The heroine is in danger, the antagonist is in the middle of her evil plot, end of story, no sequel . . . no point in reading."
2,Not her best book,This is one of my favorite author's but I was disappointed in this book. Not as good as the other books I have read by her.
3,mixed emotions,"On one hand this is a pretty good book. It was spooky and held my interest until the last page but as other reviewers have said, it's too much like Stranger With My Face and I felt ripped off."
5,Very Good Book,"This was a great book. I love to read and this was a book that I found difficult to put down once I started it. Unfortunately, I was not aware there would be a sequel that I would be forced to wait for. Since reading this book, I have faithfully searched bookstore after bookstore searching for Possession. My advice to anyone thinking of buying/reading this book is this: Don't read Obssession until you get your hands on a copy of Possession. Otherwise you'll be putting yourself through unnecessary torture."
4,GREAT ASS READING!,"Well, I've been looking for the sequel for a freakin year now. I'm still on the search! Great reading and great suspense. What awesome writing, I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see what Candra is going to do next. And who is that dark, mysterious guy who's following Mirabelle around?!"
3,Great singers have walked this path before you,"Boulez conducts a cool reading without a trace of Hungarian passion or gothic melodrama, both of which are prominent in any really fine performance. His soloists are vocally suited to their parts, but Norman applies her usual generic grand aloofness and plush vocalism to a role that calls for vulnerability and awe changing to horror, while Polgar simply isn't a major artist in any way.Bluebeard's Castle has attracted magnificent interpretations over the years, and the fact that great singers like Fischer-Dieskau, Walter Berry, Christa Ludwig, Samuel Ramey, and Anne Sophie von Otter have given their all makes this version, despite its good qualities, pretty unnecessary."
3,Eh,"You can do better than this recording.The ups: The orchestra sounds better in this recording than any other recording out there. Laszló sounds wonderful (though he's better in a different recording).The downs: Pacing is satisfactory. The orchestra moves sluggishly due to Bou-Bou's self-indulgence (sometimes I like it, but other times it's just stupid). Jessye's singing sounds lethargic, flabby, and overweight..but why am I not surprised about that? Also, her Hungarian diction is just about on par with that of Florence Foster Jenkins. :D"
1,Don't buy this book!,"The biggest complaint that I have with this book is that the answers explained are horrible. They are either useless or only confuse you more. I would highly recommend you to buy the REA(Research & Education Association) Review Book. It also has two tests but the answers explained section is quite helpful, not only telling you why an answer is right, but why each wrong answer is wrong. I have also found the test questions to be much more difficult and confusing in this book than any review book I got and from the actual exam that I just took. I am rather sorry that I wasted my money on this book and urge you not to do so as well."
4,Pretty Good Review Book,"For AP Government the Barrons book provided a good review for my students. Although I wish they would include more than 2 practice tests, the topics were well covered. It hit almost all the needed key court cases. I would reccomend this book for any student who wants to pass the exam."
2,Digital Games,"I still own a vinyl copy of this album and I can tell you that the compression involved with the digital mp3 version completely destroys the spacial, cross-channel effect (most notably on ""Delta One"") that was so hypnotic in its original analogue form. It's but a flat, two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional soundscape. What a disappointment."
4,Marco Polo is Great,I think that this book helps a lot if you are trying to write a report on him. If I had enough money then I would probably buy the book. The one thing that it needs is more pictures. I like how it gives you just the right amount of information.
5,"Erudite, superbly-delivered alternative pop","Excellent, thoughtful lyrics, fantastic lead vocals; this CD will definitely set the mood for a quiet evening of solitary introspection or tea with close friends."
2,Disappointing,"This isn't a desperate album but it comes as a considerable disappointment following the excellent 'Eventide'. It's amazing how a band feels it necessary to change a winning format. 'Eventide' was fresh, lively and song-led whereas this release appears little more than a showcase for Jennifer Nobel. The songs are much too slow and lack the same bright choruses. The hidden track only hints at what might have been although none of these songs would bear comparison with those on 'Eventide'. Hopefully Grey Eye Glances will rediscover what made them so promising. A change back to the original production could help."
4,"A ""must have"" for pond managers","Out-dated in terms of publishing date, this is the most comprehensive key to aquatic plants and has been a mainstay in my library."
5,I didn't want the story to end.,"I was hooked from the very first chapter. Maggie is a likeable and interesting character. I thought the book was well written and a real ""page turner"". When it ended I just wanted to read more. I can't wait for Susan McBride's next book!"
5,Georgescu-Roegen: a missed Nobel prize,"Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's fame is due to his book The Entropy Law and Economic Process (1971) in which NGR conjugates thermodynamics and economics. But his importance for political economy goes far before the publication of this book and involves many different aspects of the analysis. While the complete theoretical framework described by NGR has been frequently contested, his analysis of the production process has been considered as truly innovative and useful, by many points of view."
3,just okay,"Well...I wanted to love it, but it just doesn't do it for me. It takes off my makeup, but after I cleanse my face it feels like there's a film on my skin and I don't like that. The filmy feeling goes away after I use a toner, though. It also didn't help with breakouts, so I won't be purchasing again. Oh, well."
5,My All-Time Absolute Favorite Book Ever,"Elizabeth Dunkel presented me with Katia--a friend who has gone through everything I have, who feels the way I do, who thinks the way I do. Dunkel captures the hilarity and the tragedy of life so well in this novel. I hope she writes a million more books. She is inspiring to me as a writer and as a woman."
4,A few stunning songs and the young woman,"is to me many times more talented than Britney. I fell in love with songs like Kiss Me Now, and You're Gone. They had gorgeous vocals that strike your heart. I hope now that Lila doesnt leave country for mainstream."
5,WAY TO GO LILA!,LILA HAS AN AMAZING VOICE THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE A LITTLE MORE POP THEN COUNTRY BUT IT SOUNDS GOOD ALL THE SAME. HERE A LIST OF SONGS THAT I LIKETRACK 12: WHEN YOU EALKED INTO MY LIFETRACK 8: CRUSHTRACK 6: RHYMES WITHTRACK 7: I WILL BE
1,The same House beat on every track,"The beats were the same on every track, not much mixing with this DJ. A very over-rated DJ...Well maybe being from CA I may be nieve to the New York beat."
1,"Very much like a duplicate of ""Intern Blues""","The author spends a majority of the book reliving his own experience as an intern, there is plenty of items reprinted from the ""Intern Blues"", and only a small portion devoted to the three interns whom the book was supposed to portray. If you've read ""Intern Blues"", don't bother with ""Rotations"", just read ""Intern Blues"" again. These two books are almost identical."
2,"Confusing ""pastiche"" outline; sarcastic & angry viewpoint","What's wrong with the system of training M.D.s endure for three years? According to Robert Marion, everything. Patching together the diaries of '90s interns with excerpts from books and his own memories, Marion leads us month by month throuhg a year of medical internship. Much about how interns suffer, how hateful and intractable the medical system is, rife with sarcasm. Apparently interns have enough energy to write diaries of their experience with stupid nurses, vengeful lab techs and God-complex MD-CEOs but not enough to appreciate the wonder of human biology and the extreme privilege of being allowed to get paid to practice for three years on onwitting patients before going on to the highest paid, most prestigious job you can have in the USA by just being good at a science and jumping through the hoops--one of which is internship."
2,magnifer,Did not serve the purpose that I originally intended it for. The higher magnification and smaller size for viewing was not to my liking. I returned the product to the vendor. Increased shipping price and having to return the item at my own expense will make me less likely order anything else. The vendor was attentive to my needs and provided me with the necesary information to return the item and I recieved my refund very promptly.
1,A Waste of Time,"The title of this book uses the name of its subject primarily as a marketing tactic. The author is not a musicologist and the book contains no musical analysis worthy of the name. This book is an excuse for the author to present irrelevant philosophical opinions and attach them, no matter how unrelated, to the music - particularly the lyrics - of Yes.If you enjoy untangling contorted prose - and numerous parenthetical qualifiers to such prose - buy this book; otherwise leave it where found and spend your time and money on something worthwhile.This books gets one star only because it is not possible to assign it 0 stars."
3,Over the Top but interesting.,"Any book that recognises Yes' contrbution to modern music is a good thing. This book is a bit over the top though. Alot of things are eye openers and quite interesting, but in reality alot of Yes lyrics simply contribute to the big picture rather than have a direct thought-out meeting. That's part of their magic. This book gets over anaylitical, especially about song meanings. Kinda like trying to understand 2001:A Space Odessey. Perhaps the meaning is geared to be interpreted by the individual.A good read for fans, but a little too deep for its own good."
3,"Adorable, but one concerned...","I thought the book was beautifully done until I got to the end. There's a page that talks about thinking it would be fun to be an angel, but when we die we won't become one. My kids picked up on this RIGHT AWAY and stopped me from reading on. They said ""Wait, what happened to Grandma and Grandpa, aren't they angels now?"" I said right away that I did not agree with that part of the book. That we believe when our lives are done here, we go to heaven and become an angel and we watch over our family and others. I think we should be careful because there are a lot of people that find comfort in this thinking and they might be caught me off guard especially in reading it to kids. They were confused by that. So beware if this is something you've talked to your kids about, they may not like the way that part is worded."
3,"Excellent Performance, LOUSY recording quality",My voice teacher recommended this recording to me. It is a strange version of this opera. I own another version with Jussi Bjoerling as Turridu which has excellent sound. Mascagni's conducting is muuuuch toooooo slooooow on this one.Gigli's singing of the opening aria is incredible. It is a shame that the background noise on this cd wasn't cleaned up before release. I find it unlistenable without usingthe subsonic filter on my amplifier. My attempt to make a tape to play in my car was a disaster. I feel that anyone looking for this excellent performance should try another label and perhaps they will be rewarded with a wonderfull listening experience. I plan to keep this cd at least until I find a better recorded version. What a shame! I have a STRANGE voice teacher.
2,Now made in China,Save your money and buy one of the no name brand locking pliers. My last two sets of vise grip pliers are now made in china. The adjustments are gough and the threads feel gritty. In fact the chineese made husky pliers I got from Home Depot work better. I am sooooooooo upset that i can not get USA made locking pliers anymore... Time to boycot the tool makers that switch from USA to china....
3,Who is Wu Wei?,"Wu Wei is the pen name of Chris Prentiss who is controversial in the addiction recovery industry. He owns Power Press, the publisher of this I Ching book. Go to www.biroco.com for a review of this book. I read part of the book and thought it was pretty good."
3,No Table of Contents,"The problem I have with this has nothing to do with Wu Wei. It has to do with the fact that there is no table of contents. Wei tells stories about people's life long experiences with the I-Ching in this book. This is not a book that has a table of contents for each hexagram so that one could conveniently flip to a certain number and receive Wei's interpretation of that hexagram, which is the kindle book I was looking for. The fact that the I-Ching needs a table of contents ought to be obvious to kindle edition publishers."
2,Misrepresentation,This is not a translation but a trivial and tritely wordy deviation into the author's arrogance. Wu Wei's calling himself humble is a groping grandiose lie for commercial profit! Why would anyone wrap his silliness in silk as he says we should? HITRT
2,Not A Big Fan,As other reviewers have stated the explanations of the hexagrams are clear. They just don't seem to have anything to do with the question asked. You could read it from cover to cover and get lots of good advice. But to apply it to a specific question? Not so much.
3,Not quite what I expected,"I have ""Zen & The Art of Happiness"" so I figured I would love this book just as much. I didn't know it was all about how to tell your fortune with yarrow sticks (which I didn't buy with the book) and not an uplifting read that doesn't require me to buy anything extra."
2,Another Missed Opportunity,"KUKLA, FRAN AND OLLIE was another of those TV shows that figured prominently in the history of many people. And yet why is this about the only thing available on the market...and in VHS only, not on DVD? The show is a relic of TV's early days and should be marketed for those of us who grew up watching them. They were on TV for more years than many other shows that have made it to DVD. Why not this? Wake up, someone!"
1,Total trash,"I've never heard this album, but I noticed it has a song called ""F*** 311"". I would assume they're talking about the band 311, which happens to be the greatest band ever. So I really don't care what Hollister Fracus' music sounds like, but it is automatically terrible."
2,Quirky Sci Fi,Just was hoping for more science/tech focus. Kind of hard to follow. It really wasn't good enough for me to want to finish.
1,Slow,I'm the type of person to watch pretty much anything and enjoy it for what it is... but this film was painfully slow. To the point where I did something I've never done before. Stopped watching the movie 30 mins in.
2,disappointing,"Until now, I have loved everything I've read from Charles de Lint. This one was a big disappointment. The characters and the situations were strained and hard to believe - both left me with a feeling of being contrived. This is in stark contrast to my impressions from other novels that I've read. This one seemed like he was trying to be 'hip' using technical lingo (why he would do this, I have no idea!), but instead it just sounded dated (the lingo is indeed all out of date) and unnaturally stilted.Definitely would not recommend."
3,"Not bad, but not de Lint's best","This book wasn't that bad. However, I found it lacked some of the excitement of de Lint's other books. The ending sort of fell flat for me. Although I liked the premise (a spirit that takes over a website and begins to literally suck people in), I thought that it could have been done a little better. De Lint has left the ending open for a sequel (I don't know if that's what he has planned), but I think the loose ends could have been tied up a little better, and with more excitement (I'm used to more explosive crescendos from de Lint).I'd recommend de Lint's ""Trader"", ""Yarrow"", or ""Jack of Kinrowan"" over this book. None of the three feature the Internet as a main player, but they are better examples of the urban fantasy for which de Lint is famous."
4,21st Century Animism,"I am glad that deLint finally wrote an urban fantasy focusing on computers and the internet. I found his idea of technology being inhabited by spirits very interesting.It is an animism(everything has a spirit belief) for the 21st century. However, the only problem I had with this book is that for a couple chapters, near the middle, nothing much happens except for conversations between some of the characters as they try to figure out what's going on.That aside, this book is gives an intersting depiction of the worlds formed out of the overlap between the internet and the spiritworld."
4,"Fascinating ""chance"" find","This was my first experience with DeLint. I found it in paperback in a used book store, and was intrigued by the premise. I'm glad it made the keeper stack, because I found a writer that I want to read more of. I didn't find it that confusing to jump into the middle of the Newford characters like some of the reviewers who are veteran DeLint fans thought a first time reader might. I just accepted that things happened to these characters before this book, like when you meet someone for the first time, and didn't worry about it. What I did find, was that I want to read more, maybe going back to the beginning. And I may go back a read this one again after that. I won't go into details about the story-that's covered rather well in other reviews. I would recommend this to anyone with a penchant for fantasy adventure."
3,Rather pallid effort from Delint,"I agree that this book had some promising features, using the idea of the ""double"", but he used that to better effect in ""Trader"". His writing about computer and internet technology seems artificial, as though he quickly skimmed some websites to familiarize himself with the terminology, but hasn't actually lived it. Aaran's character seems implausible, and the various characters' development not well-motivated. I'd like to read more about Holly and Bojo, but Saskia, Christiana and friends did not hold my interest. In my opionion, this author's masterpiece is ""The Little Country"".- Jeff"
4,A good choice for de Lint fans,"This is a solid novel, set in Newford but mostly featuring characters not much developed thus far. It displays de Lint's excellent tight pacing and explores some interesting ideas about magic and the electric/digital world he's alluded to in short stories but never really gone for. Unfortunately, after a wonderful build up, it resolves...just a little too easily. Stephen King occasionaly displays the same weakness. It's as if the author tires of the game and sweeps the board clean just when things are as engrossing and fantastic as they can get. The story does advance the development of some great characters, including the two living Riddel brothers and the delightful Holly Rue - who gets a love interest! If you're a fan of this author and of urban fantasy, pick this one up - in hardback, even. Not his best - I can only give it four stars, he's so much better than this - but still very, very good."
3,A littel disapointed,The movie was well done not some cheap porn film. It lacked in instruction and explanation of what was going on. I did lern some from the movie but I am looking for other sourses for better more detailed instruction. When i buy an instructional video I want to learn something.
1,Displeased,"This is a pretentious video.It is purported to tell the viewers how to make loveto women. But I doubt it has succeeded.Be warned the video might not be exciting to some people.It is something between hard-core and soft-core.There is a penetration by finger, but nothing else."
2,Goddess Worship,If this works for 10-15% of people I would be surprised. I really didn't learn anything I didn't know before. I imagine some people wouldn't know.
1,Your Place of Worship,"Turn the sound off. Run this DVD at 60 times normal speed. Then, you'll have a ""high"" concept sex comedy every man can enjoy."
5,It was the best reference book about AOL that I have read,I was completely new to the whole AOL experience when I purchased this book. I read it cover to cover in two days. It was very easy to comprehend and I loved the way John Kaufeld added humor throughout the whole book. I refer to it on several occasions and usually find something new to experience that I missed before. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is starting out on AOL who needs simple but complete guidance.
1,Redundant Title,"I believe the title of this book, ""America Online for Dummies,"" is redundant. They should just called it ""America Online"" since the ""for dummies"" part is already implied. Only dummies use AOL, so the title of this book would be like saying ""Dentistry for Dentists."""
4,Easy way to learn Chinese,"This is a follow up to the Volume 1 which has helped me set a target to achieve my goal to learn and write a character each day, stroke by stroke. It also allows me to review the previous characters that I have learned. Very handy and available any time I need it. A quick and easy way to learn writing Chinese characters offline without the costly investments of online learning. A brilliant idea to learn Chinese!"
5,"best mix of modern rock, bluses, reggea & great lyrics","A co-worker turned me on to this CD. I could not get enough of Topley's music. ""Song of the Seabird"" throws me back to the Florida Keys. Other tunes put me in the blues clubs of New Orleans, Chicago or Portland Oregon. His poetic lyrics are outstanding and very clever. Who's been hiding Topley? I haven't been so hooked on an album since Sgt Pepper and Santana. My co-worker finally got her CD back after three weeks. I'll have hide mine from my teenage son. On second thought, we'll listen to it together, for as long as he wants. Why not, CD's don't wear out and neither does Topley's music! Turn it up! (Mr Topley, thanks for the great music. I'll spread the word whenever I can.)"
5,A terrific collection of soulful craftily written tunes,"William Topley captures the essence of many forms of music, terrific writing and great musical interludes. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed lyrics so refreshing and thought provoking. His style and voice are very interesting, he deserves radio play. I feel if one listens to his music once, it will drive you to listen again and again."
3,"Decent songs, good tenors, but not the ""3 irish tenors""","I just wanted to give a quick review....This recording is very nice, decent songs sung by talented artists, but I just wanted anyone who is considering buying it to know it is not the ""3 Irish tenors"" (John Mcdermott and company) as seen on PBS. I personally think Amazon should state the tenors names so this won't confuse future customers."
3,Interesting but hard to follow.,"While I found parts of this book very interesting -- the history of Newfoundland and how it related to the Goodyear family -- the author's writing style was irritating and hard to follow. The author said that his family told stories in ""great, looping circles,"" and that is what he has done here. I was frustrated with this book because the author would go off on tangents and would not stick to the narrative, making it difficult to follow and to find out what happened to the characters in his family.I did learn a great deal about Newfoundland and how it was affected by the First World War, and for that alone, it is worth reading."
1,Wrong Size,"The ad for the product did not have the dimensions easily available on the description of the product. Although the product was adequate, the size was wrong and of no use to me."
5,An Excellent Bluetooth Car System,"I installed the Motorola HF850 in my 2001 Olds Aurora 4.0 almost 3 1/2 years ago. It is excellent, making the 3 other handsfree systems that I had look like the garbage they were."
4,ask anbody -this is good!,"i heard 'hey now now' when it was released in th UK ages ago, i always loved the song and the gorgeous brothers! the album did not disapoint me either! the best songs have got to be 'candy in the sun' 'hey now now' and 'ask anybody'. yes the music does sound a little hansonish, but its got such a pretty sound to it, it can really make you smile. its perfect summer radio music, the guys have got got gorgeous voices too. its got almost an 80s kind of sound, but in a good way. buy this is if you like to dance to fresh summary music all year round,"
2,Not too great,"I got it for Hey Now Now which is the only really good song on the CD, the other being Candy in The Sun. I was kind of disappointed, and if I had to do it all over I wouldn't get the CD."
5,The best album in history!,"This cd is the best album I've ever heard, and most ppl I have played it to totally agree. These brothers have managed to find their own sound, and you can't compare them to anybody else! They've managed what hardly anybody else has done, to make an album where none of the songs are bad or boring. Ususally when you play an album you skip one or two of the songs, but with ""Ask anybody"" you just HAVE to listen to them all...again, and again, and again... My personal fave songs are ""Ask Anybody"", ""Stick around"" ""There"" ""Forget you too"" ""Hey now now""...etc.Can't wait for the next album to come out!"
2,A fans DVD,"This DVD sucks even for a wrestling fan. Its very cheaply made, and you can't understand what the wrestlers are saying and talking about because of the bad audio. They make the DVD extras sound great but don't be fooled. All they are is a one-on-one conversation with the wrestlers and its info the wrestling fan already knows. On the Hardcore Holly interview you can hear a train in the background and once again the audio is horrible on these interviews. The only good thing on this DVD is the ""Road Dogg"" interview, the rest is junk. The star wrestlers they use on the writing and back of the cover aren't even in the documentary. They just used ""Raven"" and a couple others on advertising this DVD so it would sell. Its very short and not worth the money."
4,Good inside look of Indie Wrestling,Not the greatest wrestling documentary but it is a good one. Really shows a lot of the hard work it takes to make it in the business but also show the stigma's that indie wrestlers have to deal with from the public.
3,Interesting But,not what i expected but not all Bad. Mostly international and Ungeard of Performers with the exception of D-Lo Brown and Al Snow
3,Eh...,"This documentary is alright. It features a few insider issues that all indy wrestlers deal with, but it also doesn't really hit on anything other than one section of the indy scene. For a documentary, it was a good romp through the motions of wrestling and what indy guys go through on a day-to-day basis. But for a wrestling documentary, it left too many things out, and left on a sour note (in my opinion).If you're just getting into wrestling, don't watch this quite yet. This is a gritty, but realistic, view of what they go through. But it's not done in the most professional of ways."
4,police work at its best,HYDE really hits the spot as police procedures are represented in its rarest form. Believable plot and characters is what makes this book work. Having spent time in the same neighborhood that the story takes plaace only added to my appreciation of this book. Mahoney in New York is what Connelly is in Los Angeles. These guys should team up one day.
2,Cute little book with good descriptions and some ideas.,"I was expecting a little bit bigger book with lots of ideas for bouquets for a wedding. There were some pages with pictures of flowers, their names, and what season they were available in. There is a little bit of advice on shopping for wedding flowers, but not much. I expected more from the editors of Bride's Magazine."
2,Horrid Reproduction!,"The reproducer if the original book must be the most inept person allowed to operate equipment without supervision!The book contents are set in 2 columns per page. The reproducer consistantly cut off part of each left page's right column. I am on page 114 and there hasn't been more than 5 left pages intact. They also have copied their HAND on pages, making those unreadable!!! This is certainly NOT because it's an old book. I'm glad someone gave me this for a gift, as I would have been horrified if I had paid good money for such a piece of shotty reproduction. Many a child would have done better. I gave it 2 stars, since the info that I CAN read is quite interesting."
5,Great manga from CLAMP!,"Angelic Layer is another manga from the hit circle CLAMP. The art is nothing like some of their older series, like Rayearth, CCS, or X. It's different, and very cute nonetheless. This is my favorite style that CLAMP has drawn in, I think. Anyway, the story's really great. A girl named Misaki finds out about the phenomenon called ""Angelic Layer,"" where players control and battle their very own ""Angels."" Naturally, she decides to get her very own! CLAMP makes lots of references to their other series--Misaki even names her Angel ""Hikaru"" after ""a heroine in a manga"" she just read. This volume ends in a cliff hanger, and I definitely want the next one ASAP!"
4,I love this series. :),"It combines two things I adore; fighting games and customizable, highly articulated dolls! (Or action figures if you don't like the word doll.) Plus, the characters are all very cute and funny. It's a fun little action/comedy that I think even boys might enjoy, if you could get them into it. I hope the release of these books means they're planning on translating the animated series soon too.My only minor complaint is I'm not sure how many non-manga/anime fans will be turned off by the fact you have to read these books from what is, in a Western point of view, from back to front. I know one of my friends who doesn't really like manga or anime (though she is of the type who will probably never like more than a few scattered shows as she hates the genre in general) liked the idea of the series but was immediatly frustrated by the formatting.Otherwise, I think it's another outstanding series by CLAMP. :)Huzzah for brand loyalties! ;D J/K"
5,I LOVE THIS MANGA!,"By now you have probably read a bunch of rewiews about this manga, so you probably know what it's about, so i'll just say whae i liked about it. this manga is probably the best i've read (including dot hack sighn and dragon ball z), this is because of all the good characters and the balance of humor and action. misaki is a good character, she is a loyal and good friend, ichan is funny and mysterous, and shokuo is also hiding something i cant tell you just yot. over all, this manga ROCKS!"
4,Good...,"I think this book was a little too much like Pokemon. True, it's got more action, but the basis is the same. Also, it was rushed, and did you know the art style is almost exactly like Pokemon too?So if you LOVE pokemon and shoujo, Angelic Layer is a mix of the two.(Note: If you HATE Pokemon, still give this a try. It's not THAT bad!)"
5,Fan Smeggin' Tastic,"I've always loved Red Dwarf, and, for series one, this video is definately the best!"
3,Comforter missing?,"Sheets are very nice, but did any one notice that the set is missing conforter which is clearly mentioned in the product details."
3,Dry but interesting,"Interesting for someone just getting into this subject, it's more of a recitation of model-year features than an in-depth examination. Prose is a little dry, it livens up when Herd talks to actual designers or drivers.Not bad, and at a good price."
5,An absolute must read!!!,"I thought this was a most excellent book! Very enlightening and entertaining. Once I picked it up and started reading, I could not put it down. As soon as I finished it, I started over again - and I have re-read many sections. Tara's astrological abilities are phenomenal! I really enjoyed how she tied everything together. There is a wealth of information here that you will want to share. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. I have been a very big fan and am delighted with Dick's honesty and playfulness. Thank you for another wonderful read!!!"
3,"A fun, interesting read","A truly metaphysical book with enough out there theories to satisfy. The stories were interesting, varied and carried more relatable details of the mistakes and trials of human relationships than many books of this type. Balancing the 'everything is perfect no matter what' typical of the genre with 'this life can be incredibly confusing and hard' is unusual.Did anyone else get uncomfortable with all the Hollywood name dropping though? It was as if the stories wouldn't be credible if the people they were about weren't somehow very special luminaries of some sort. It was amusing and then low and behold...Babaji himself chastises one of their clients for focusing too much on the illusions of fame, power and status. And Dick Sutphen argued with him that maybe Babaji was being too judgmental! That was my laugh out loud moment. I wonder if they ever got that particular message from their own book? :)"
5,Great book!,"Ever wonder why things happen to you or why people treat you in a way? Master hypnotist and wonderful writer Dick Sutphen explains in a very simple and understandable manner the way we agree to come to this world to play a role or a part in life's theater. If you are into past lives, hypnosis and metaphysics you will love the stories Dick has to offer."
3,ok book,"the content is OK, not exactly what I was looking for, but it is not the book's fault.The physical book itself is not very good. It started to fall apart after a few days of reading."
1,contrived,"It is an old..new age story. Although I agree with the idea of reincarnation, we need better research. This isn't it. If you want to be mildly entertained, then buy the book. If you are a serious about valid information, then it is best to look elsewhere."
5,This Answers the Hard Questions About the WHY of Relationships,"Dick Sutphen, his work, his teachings, his books have been teaching me for over 30 years. He's been two jumps ahead of most metaphsycal authors for years. Thankfully the world is catching up and there are many wonderful books now available. This one is based on a specialty of Mr. Sutphen- Relationships, and it is one fascinating read! You will certainly find yourself in the pages, and you will gain insight and understanding to your relationships with the people who have come into (or out of) your life. The case studies read like great novelettes. The wisdom is simple yet profound. If you have a relationship with another human and want to gain greater understanding...then you must have this book. With Love, and thanks for the inspiration, Richard! Judy M Johnson, Author of book/meditation CD, ""Tapping Into Joy; A Handbook to Reveal Your True LIGHT"" www.tappingintojoy.com"
2,lameish,"not so great, also bought standard model in same size/brand, works great. maybe it's my technique with the saucer, but it makes a mess"
2,wont crush black pepper,"This will not crush black peppercorns,it is ok for dried herbs.The idea seemed great but it just doesn't do the job."
5,Works great,"Some things, like small seeds, grind better in this type of grinder than in the bowl style"
2,Not all that,"Maybe I'm just not that good with a mortar and pestle, but I find it difficult to crush small-seed spices with this item."
1,Doesn't work,"I had great expectations for this M&P, but it just doesn't work. It doesn't grind anything. I've tried it on fennel, flax seeds, peppercorns, you name it. Not only does it not grind, but anything you put in it tends to fly out everywhere when any pressure is applied. I do not recommend this at all."
2,Poor Fit,"The mortar & pestle set arrived promptly, but the shape of the pestle face bit not fit well with the mortar bowl."
5,Great for Pills,"I keep one of these in my tack room, and it's perfect for grinding up pills for critters. Just the right size, so it stays out of the way. The only problem? Well, porcelain can break, and after dropping it on more than one occasion (with minimal harm), the last drop knocked of the handle. I'll be ordering a new one."
3,The real thing,This is the real thing.Hawaiian singing and playing by a terrific group.The religious nature of some of the songs was a surprise but not a bad one.It's a great portrait of Braddah Iz as a young singer and within an ensemble.I love it.
4,Rough Reggae,"Toots & The Maytals make melodic reggae with beautiful vocal harmonies. Recorded in 1976 in Kingston and London, this album was coproduced by the legendary Chris Blackwell. Funky Kingston explores the rougher edge of the band in classic tracks like the hypnotic Pomp and Pride and the mesmerising Louie Louie. There's a joyous party atmosphere in the rousing choruses and the lilting beats. Daddy is a jazzy, bluesy song and doesn't sound like reggae at all, while the title track is a tour de force of funky reggae. Toots vocalises a lot throughout, whith ""la la's"" and ""da da's"" to take the groove beyond words. Rough and rootsy, this album ranks among this legendary band's finest moments. It is also available as a double CDFunky Kingston/In the Darkwith the band's other great album of the same year."
3,"Good songs, poor sound","As a huge Supersuckers fan, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed with this album. The set list is good, with live performances of some of their newer material. However, the sound quality is not very good. I'd expect this sound to come from a bootleg, not an official band release. Wish I could give this more stars.I'd suggest you go to a live show and experience the rocking in person."
4,As expected,Item was just as I expected. It works well but wish that I had gotten one that describes code on screen. Got this one because price was ok and it had ability to keep updated in future
2,Just a code reader that's all,"I should have searched for a more comprehensive code reader. This one will only give you the problem codes if you have a CHECK ENGINE condition. What I needed was a unit that will give give live data from the sensors so that I can do correctional work before the Check Engine light comes on. I have a car experiencing a high gas consumption problem and needs a diagnostic check on the O2, EGR, Evap, STFT, etc. There are units that can do this for a few dollars more than this unit."
4,Works as advertised,The product is easy to use. It would be more useful if the manual contained more information on how to interpret the various codes or at least better links to site where this information is available.
2,It seems to work fine.,"My wife's Toyota only had the maintenance light on which can be shut-off by pressing the odometer reset while turning the ignition key on-off-on, so I just got an ""Engine Okay"" diagnostic with the Acron. The CD is useless - Google has much more up-to-date information. It's fine for the money. I couldn't afford what I wanted, a device that plugs into my laptop and I can flash to upgrade to the latest - anytime."
4,OBDII Code Readers,"The Actron CP9125 is a good basic code reader. It performs well and is easy to use. The reader will identify basic trouble codes and allows one to reset the ""check engine"" light. My experience using the reader with a 2000 Volvo identified some but not all of the problems causing the ""check engine"" warning light. After repairing the items identified, an additional problem had to be identified by a Volvo dealer with a more sophisticated code reader."
4,It does what it is supposed to do,"Great tool. Plug it in, get the codes and look them up on the internet."
5,Worth every penny!,Cheaper to buy the Actron PocketScan than to pay to have the check engine light turned off. Useful tool for DIY auto repairman to read and erase check engine codes. Arrived quickly and with free shipping from Amazon and at a great price!
5,OBD CODE SCANNER,tHIS CODE SCANNER S PERFECT FOR EVERYONE THAT OWNS A 1996 OR NEWER VECHICLE YOU CAN CHECK FOR CODES WHEN YOUR ENGNE LGHT COMES ON And either fix it yourself or tell your mechanic whats wrong and get an exact price for any problem.
4,Quick-N-Easy,"I purchased a used Saturn for my twin daughters to drive and low and behold, one week after I bought it the ""check engine"" light came on. I searched the web and found this product, after plugging it in and reading the code I was able to fix the minor problem without taking it to the dealer who would have no doubt charged me way to much. So I am Very Happy with the product!!"
1,didnt work,"i had no problem with shipping it arrived in a couple days but i could not get mine to do anything other then say ""no link"" , i would do what it said and start over and same thing so i'm sending it back and gonna try the 9135 model and hope it works."
4,"Don't let the dealer ""Pull"" the codes for you",I purchased a used Mercedes 320 SLK a couple of months ago. The check engine light came on and I felt helpless. I went to the Mercedes dealer and they said it would cost $189 to pull the codes. After leaving the dealer with my money I purchased the Actron CP9125. It worked so easy and gave me the information I needed. I made the needed repair and no new codes.
2,"Not worth it, had to return it",This OBDII reader is way too simple. Doesn't really do much in diagnostic. Could not reset anything. Save up and buy a bit more better unit.
2,Warning!! This porduct contains lead!,"After getting the Actron diagnostic code reader, it worked great, just like it said. Unfortunately, when trying the product, I noticed a tag on the cord that siad ""Warning this cord contains lead""!I was upset by this, beccause now I have to wear gloves when using it. I recommend that anyone who is interested in this product should save their money & find something similar."
1,Good Tool - great price,"This item performed as expected, reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with OBD-II connector. Easy to use - only 2 buttons! You might be able to find it $10 cheaper at a local store on sale, but even at the price I paid it was a BARGAIN! Cost of tool = 1 diagnostic visit to local shop."
4,Not fancy but works well,"Used this to diagnose a misfire on my Subaru. The hardest thing was to locate the access port under the dash, but not really difficult. Instructions were perfectly clear. Once the computer port was found, you only need to snap it into the port and read away using the scroll key. The diagnostic code was contained in the booklet, and also widely available on the net. Resetting the Check Engine light was very easy."
3,Actron CP 9125 Scanner,"This is a nice little scanner, however, the ""DTC"" lookup Software will not download if you are running Windows 7. So you are basically without a owners manual. I went to Actrons web page and copied the manual. Kind of a pain but it had all the codes you need."
4,Actron Automotive Code Reader,"The code reader I got was new and unused, but it was from very old stock.....it did not have any late model cars listed in the accompanying literature....but it worked fine. I am well-satisfied overall. It will definitely read the error codes and it is an excellent diagnosis tool. I would recommend it to anyone. I had looked at a more powerful code reader, but you had to have a laptop computer there at the car in order to use it......this one is simple, and it ""stands alone""......and, best of all, it is dirt cheap :-)"
4,"easy to use, great price","I bought this from Amazon for $39.99, it sells at the local Pepboys for $80. It is very simple to use, had my reading in approx. 3 min. Diagnosed a misfiring problem I had correctly. The garage I went to got the same exact reading and charged me $65. The dealer charges $90. Now I know it doesn't take a $10,000 machine and only takes a few minutes. Yet the garages will charge you twice the price of this OBD reader for one lousy diagnostic. Highly recommended item that can save you a ton of money."
5,great value,"I purchased this product since I thought it would be a valuable tool to troubleshoot problems with my 97 F150 that I recently purchased. I'm glad I did! Check engine light came on 1 week after I had the truck, I plugged in the scanner, looked up the code, and had the problem fixed in less than 2 hours. Perfect item for the DIY repair guy. reasonable price and a quality entry level diagnostic tool for the money."
4,Awesome,"Very easy to use equipment. If you are not a mechanic and don't need expensive diagnostic tools, this one will do. Simple to use. From plugging it in to the car and retrieving the code, the whole process takes about 3 minutes."
5,Great diagnostic tool,This Diagnostic code reader is very easy-to-use. The interface is very intuitive.Comes with a quick start guide that helps you get started right away. A very worthy investment that saves you all those trips to the mechanic (and the money :-) ).
5,Good product,This is a great product. I have save a lot of people money by using the scanner. I suggest everyone should buy this.The dealership will charge you any where from 80-100 dollars to check out your problem when your check engine light comes on.
1,fair,"I just bought it for eliminating the check engine light as mention in the product description. Looks like failed, it just give me nothing else but a strange code not appearing in the manual."
1,Piece of junk,"Wow what a piece of junk. Worked for about 2 months and broke. All I get is a ""NO LINK"" message. Have tried on many cars but to no luck. Don't waste your money buy something else"
5,PocketScan Code Reader,Great product for a great price. Works fine and helps me out when I have engine light go on to tell me what it wrong. At least I know what is wrong and see if garage who is going to fix comes up with same code as the problem. I can then know who is being truthful when I bring my car in.
4,Actron CP9125,I used this on a 1999 Chevy Blazer and it worked fine. No problems attaching or removing and it gave the scan results as expected. Erasing the codes also worked well with no problems. I would recommend this unit for someone that wants a simple to use and relatively inexpensive scanner.
3,Code Reader,"I've given it 3 stars due to a not correct reading. It said I had 2 engine codes, but I have a Hyper tech programmer that said I have 3 engine codes. Haven't really tested it out yet. Bought to check other family and friends cars. Sort of an entry model. it's just to get my feet wet. Think it's a decent buy. There was one better model but could no longer buy. So it's the best model for the price..."
4,"As described, fast shipping","A good product that operated as described. Easy to follow instructions for simple computer code reading. I identified my problem, fixed it, and using this product, cleared the code from the system."
4,Does the job!,"Worked very well on a 04 Jeep liberty and a 97 Honda Civic, eliminating the fault codes. Paid for itself twice over."
3,Usefull,It does do what it is supposed to do but the codes it displays don't always point you in the correct direction. For example it points to oxygen sensors a fair bit and they usually aren't the problem. It has also given me a correct codes that were right on.
5,Great Little Gadget,I purchased this for a check light on a Tahoe. It instantly diagnosed the problem and cleared the code. Oil cap was missing. A must have for anyone who owns a car.
4,Great handy item,Works Great! exactly as expected with easy to understand and well documented instructions. Piece of mind and validation for those about to go to the dealership ($$$) for diagnostics service.
5,Saved me a hassle,"I bought this for my daughter while she's away at college so we can identify trouble with her 99 Grand Am without her having to run bills up at a shop, or having me take a four hour drive to troubleshoot a minor or non-existant problem.It came in handy for me too, for after extensive repair work was done on my car, my Check Engine Light came on a day later. Instead of having the car tied up until they could get it back in, I was able to determine it was a minor problem with a disconnected hose. I took it right back and they were able to do a short job of re-attaching it....while I waited.It paid for itself already."
4,Actron CP9125,"This scanner worked very well, providing the needed information and more, except for one thing. It has an opening on the back that holds it onto the connecter, and that made it very difficult to remove. It's as if it was designed for a permanent connection."
5,Worth spending your money,"My 01 toyota camry's check engine light suddenly glow one week before emission test. It freak me out, another couple of hundred bucks to spent..I came to know this product..Purchased it and found that problem is in the o2 sensor. Erased the code and passed emission test..I must say if you want to off check engine light and want to pass emission test, buy this product..It's worth spending your money.."
3,Perhaps an outdated science?,"I really wanted to believe in the science of colon cleansing. In the end, after much reading and scrutinizing, I've decided that modern colonoscopists, with their regular live-video trips up people's behinds, must know what they're talking about.But I also feel that the true extent of the relationship between bowel health and other illnesses, isn't fully understood by modern western medicine, which fails very often to appreciate the hollistic nature of health, opting to focus on treating symptoms rather than identifying the root cause."
1,Leapfrog Touch and Tug Discovery Book,"I purchased this book for my 6 year old disable grandson as he loves this toy. The problem is sometimes it goes on and sometimes it doesn't. I would have returned this book but it would has cost too much to return it.This is not this first book that I have had, this is our 4th and this one was the worse.Anyway it makes him Happy and that's what's important.Diana"
4,Michelle Sapphire watch,This is a beautiful watch. Worth every penny. The sapphires add a unique finish. The face is big for a ladies watch but it still has a nice look to it.
4,Funny Dude,"This is hilarious stand-up, but beware Ron is pretty crude at times. You have to know him to love him. I would only recommend this to a close friend."
4,Used Good - more like used not so good,It was in a little worse shape than described but not so bad that I would send it back. Still four stars worthy.
3,Book review,"Item condition is perfect as described by seller. However, book is very confusing and hard to study from."
5,Comprehensive book on the real castles of Ireland,"Many books exist that are titled as being the castles of Ireland and in reality are coffee table books on the rebuilt banquet venues on scant castle remains or grand manor homes. While those have their place, this book remains on the subject and with complete authority on castles~ despite the opening disclosure of the author. McNeill has done his homework with prodigious diagrams throughout. Heartily and highly recommended by The Castle Lady !"
2,Much too terse.,"The authors use non-traditional symbolism and do not always define symbols used. For example,what is wring with the way Papoulis and Peebles define various statistical operators?Changing what is so widely accepted does not make your presentation better. It just takeslonger to understand background subject matter and introduces unnecessary confusion into your finaltopic - Kalman filters."
2,Better Summary Than Explanation,Don't look to this book as a satisfactory introduction to Kalman Filters. The authors seem to confuse summation with explanation -- this is a good review if you already know the material but it doesn't convey the concepts very well. I studied a 1993 edition of this book with Version 1.1 of the software and the Fortran source code that was provided was incomplete. I see from the author's review that new source code in C has been added since then so this may no longer be the case.
2,Not suitable as a tutorial,"The organization and content of the book doesn't lend itself to use as a tutorial. Heavy on equations/proofs and short on conceptual discussion. You'll need a graduate-school level of int/diff calculus, matrix algebra and statistics to get much out of this book, and that's only if you're interested in detailed derivations and historical perspective. I was hoping for something that would allow me to take the proofs ""on faith"" and get rapidly into implementation, but that's not in this book. I got a used copy for $2.50 so it was worth that, probably would have balked if it had been much more."
3,New interests and odd memories of heart transplant patients,"The best part of this book are the actual stories of heart transplant patients where they develop new interests (e.g., diet, music, sex) and have odd memories (e.g., of the death of the donor) following heart transplant surgery. Unfortunately, these stories are few, and most of the book is a hodgepodge of research and speculations on energy medicine. It does make you think though - of cellular memories, the body as a hologram, the connectness between humans and the availability of information through higher dimensions - but I would have appreciated a better edited book."
2,Good Concept - Boring Book,While I accept the theories presented in the book I think Pearsall worked so hard to appear completely scientific that the book became incrediblely boring. He repeated himself in an effort to appear seriously scientific and lost the humaness of his story.
3,Cynical read,"Alothough Pearsall's book posesses much information about the new study of energy-cardiology, the author is very cynical towards the brain. The book talks of how wonderfully compassionate the heart is, and how selfishly greedy the brain is. And after reading the text on subjects like this, Pearsall sounds like the kind of person whom, if you didn't act completely contumelious towards the brain, he'd say you were denying the truth.Besides his crude anecdotes about the brain, the information and stories about the different transplant patients he's studied in the past is a great and mind-opening read. Actually, everything besides his comments about our brains, is a marvelous source of new, interesting information about the L-energy/energy cardiology observations and studies.Recommended, but not highly."
4,"people of planet earth, check this one out..","quite interesting, i really made a impact on my belief system about how we as humans interact and communicate with each other. i feel like i can sense things better now. in a nut shell, our heart is the new brain of the new age. and the brain driven world has us in shambles. I would have preferred a more distilled version of the book, but the real life stories and very far out and super interesting."
5,This spray really does hit the spot.,"I received this spray as a birthday gift from a friend last year. I leave it right above my work desk and spray it every time I get stressed out and being a project manager, that's pretty much every day. The effect is amazing. The aroma alleviates the tension and provides an immediate relief right down in the heart of it. If you don't buy it for yourself, please buy it for that stressed out friend of yours. You know you have one. She/He will appreciate it!"
2,Not the same power rating as the OEM,"I bought this as an extra AC adapter for my new VAIO laptop computer.The orignal SONY VGP-AC16V7 adapter is 16V 2.2A whereas this one is 15-24V 4.3A.The higher amps is what worries me the most, and I'm very reluctant to plug into my $2000 laptop."
3,Nice story,I got this book for a dollar from my library's Book Nook. This was my first book by Michael Phillips. I enjoyed the story. It kept me interested. There wasa point in the book when I got a little bored - during Mercy & Eagleflight's conversions. It got a little preachy but that part was written better than some I've read. The ending was very good but I never got the kiss I'd been waiting for since the beginning of the book. Michael needs to know that most women like a kiss or two in their stories. Three or four would be nice too...but at least ONE...please! I think most poeople will like this book. I really got the feel of what it was like to live life in the old west.
5,Beyond Expectations,"Where do I begin? I took a chance on a recording without really looking that it was taken from three performances in the 1920s and 30s with the same two lead singers - Easton and Melchior. When I realized it, I thought ""damn"" was I asleep when I ordered? So, then I expected sound that would be aboriginal - dull voices and/or orchestra with the same deficiency. What I got was shock! Firstly - the engineers who transferred material from the 1920s and 30s should have received an award. The transfers are absolutely astonishing, the sound of both the voices and orchestra being so well defined and clean that I was taken aback. Now, this is a performance taken from three conductors and three different venues, perhaps we should learn something? They create atmoshphere! We are at an occasion! The singers do that, also, and they act! Wagner's masterpiece brought to life. Without doubt, this is well beyond what I expected. It should never be out of the catalogue."
4,"Perfect, minus two little flaws","This game is great. Works fine on Xp and Vista.There are many customizable features. Including:- the amount houses and hotels- bail amount- maximum turns in jail- income tax amount- salary amountYou can enable or disable rules to:- forced auctions- auction to start game- double salary for landing on go- maximum amount of turnsThe graphics, game play, game speed and controls are good. There is a complete history of the game. Several games can be saved. Player profiles for all the characters.This is typically better than the board version. Game play is fast, there is no need for a banker .Its just all-in-all a good game. However, I have two gripes with Monopoly Here and Now for PC.1) To play the came the CD must be in the tray.2) There is a maximum of 4 players, rather than 8 like most monopoly board versions.Minus these two flaws this game is perfect."
3,"Enjoyable, but buggy.","As much fun as the board game, but has an annoying tendency of locking up in the middle of a game, with no way to get it to move. If they release a patch, it would be more enjoyable."
1,"Fun, but has its problems",I picked this up to replace a much older version of this electronic game. It loaded much better than the 2001 version I had and the graphics are excellent. It is fun to play and enjoy - BUTIt does have some bugs in the software and Encore USA provides no support and is just about impossible to reach in a meaningful way. Its web site has no way to log a problem nor does it offer a patch. Its FAQ on the game is 3 questions long and just about useless. It is a challenge to even find a phone number to call the CA office on and you may as well give up because they put you on hold and never respond to your call.
3,No bells & whistles like the 95/98 earlier version,"Monopoly still stands as a great game, but this version has no banker stats to look at like the earlier 95-98 3D version. This program does not automatically track any stats on your overall value to determine if paying 10% or $2M tax; it does not track how much money you've earned on each property owned... If you have the 95/98 version then you know what I'm talking about. The developers took the time to create a great game then. ""Here and Now"" is nothing more that the regular game x's $1M in regards to the property values and who cares about the different tokens."
5,Spiced up version gets A+,"The Monopoly Here and Now game is so much fun, you will find your addicted to the game. It's a great spin on the old original. Unlike the old game, you get a ton of money to start with, so the places, such as Disney World cost a whole lot more money then the chepaer streets of yesteryear. You feel like you are Donald Trump whe you land on the spaces and area able to buy some great and historical areas. You really do feel like a millionaire. My only complaint is that the computer seems to get to go first most of the time. Trust me, you need to get out in front of this game from those playing with you. Properties get snatched up left and right. But enjoy! I know I do whenever I play."
3,Why not the 'Paganini Rhapsody' also??,"I bought these recordings when they came out on vinyl and then again when they appeared on cassette. I had eagerly awaited their arrival on CD, yet found myself tremendously disappointed and angry when Vasary's essay of the Rachmaninoff concerti was released WITHOUT his masterful interpretation of the 'Rhapsody On A Theme Of Paganini' - which to my knowledge has not been released on CD at all. Why do companies persist in such foolishness? I know there is an Ashkenazy set which was released the same way. However, one can find Ashkenazy's multiple 'Rhapsody' recordings everywhere; the same cannot be said for the Vasary performance, which is one of the best ever recorded in my personal opinion. How can one have the four Rachmaninoff concerti without the 'Rhapsody'??My rating is for this reason and this reason alone. It has nothing to do with Vasary's performances of the works which ARE included here, which are in themselves brilliant."
4,"an excellent work of ""fiction""","This book is very well researched and written however it falls short of creating a plausible conflict scenario in south asia. There are way to many improbabilities in the plot like the American non involvemebt, renegade indian units, and nuclear trigger happy heads of state. If this is potrait of a worse case scenario (where every one has gone off their rocker) then its understandable otherwise it is highly likely that cooler heads will prevail before the situation ends in the way the book describes it."
3,worth a look,very well researched. plausible plot. but just a little dry. worth the money if you're into detailed discussions onIndian/Pakistani relations.
3,Poor proportions...,"While i could tell this was a cheap-o version of a Swiss flag, i wish they would post an ACTUAL photo of the product because on arrival it's obvious the flag isn't the right proportions, the white cross is much to fat."
1,Biased Opinionated Drivel,"Quite obviously these two are anti-Israel. Their writings lead one in the direction they choose. For example on one page they will state that a certain action was not authenticated. Then, several pages on, this same fact will again be presented as completely true.If a person desires to read about the Israeli Intelligence, there are far better choices to select from.Pure crapola."
5,Return of an old friend,My books were all lost in a move several years ago. This is a copy of one that was lost. I had forgotten just how good it is.
3,Not all Kuhn Rikons are equal,"I purchased the Kuhn Rikon easy squeeze for myself about a year ago. My daughter loved it and I saw this one in a discount store for a really good price so I bought it for her. There is no comparison between the two. She couldn't squeeze this one using both hands while she had no trouble with the easy squeeze with one hand. So, being the kind and generous soul that I am, I now have this one and she has my easy squeeze (which I will eventually buy another). It does press garlic, just not easily."
3,Somewhat flimsy,I don't normally buy plastic kitchen tools when a metal one is available. But Cooks Illustrated likes this brand so I thought I'd give it a try. I hate the scraper attachment. We took it off right away. It was annoying and got in the way. The handle feels a little flimsy when pressing the garlic. And it takes a lot of effort to squeeze. Not like my old Zyliss garlic press. The Zyliss press is SO easy to squeeze but the coating on the metal starts to flake off almost right away and that makes me nervous which is why I bought this Kuhn Rikon.The positive side of this press is that's it's SUPER easy to clean.
2,does a good job but will break,"I had the same experience that apparently a lot of others did. While it worked, it gave great results - produces more juice and finer pulp than other garlic presses, cleans easily, and is easy to use. But from the start I could tell it wasn't going to last long. The handles flex quite a bit when you're trying to squeeze cloves of garlic, and sure enough, after about a year the upper block developed a big crack. Plastic just isn't strong enough to handle this kind of pressure."
3,Fine for a while,"The press was OK for a while. I liked that the metal screen flipped out for easy cleaning. I had been accustomed to using metal garlic presses before. However, when switching to the Kuhn Rikon, I noticed I couldn't quite load it as much as the metal one I had before; the plastic would ""give"" or bend a little bit. As another reviewer posted, this model is built in a couple of separate pieces that will over time, cause it to break at the top of the grip (the stress point). Mine lasted a few years, but I hate to make it a regular thing to keep putting this kind of plastic in our landfill. I'm going back to a metal one."
2,"Right Bowl, Wrong Color","These are your basic Pyrex 1 1/2 Qt bowls...only problem is they are NOT blue as pictured...they are clear glass. So, functionally, they work. However, I bought them primarily for the cobalt blue decorative effect...the use was a secondary concern...since I planned to display them on a rack with my other blue glassware. [Amazon even has ""cobalt kitchen"" as one of the Tag Sggestions].I have advised Amazon, so, hopefully, they will correct the photos that they currently are using."
4,Filter,Exactly what I ordered and the product met my expectation. This is the second time we ordered these and they have worked perfectly each time. Price a little high but the product if good.
4,Jeff Johnson is a great musician.,"I bought this soundtrack simply because Jeff Johnson put it together. The music is good, but not great. Let me quickly explain: I am a big fan of Jeff Johnson's music, especially when he works with Brian Dunning. The Katurran Odyssey CD has good music, but not enough variation between one song and the next. NOTE also: these songs are on the CD in an order that matches the story from the book by the same name, and therefore are probably in a ""crescendo"" order, leading up to the end of the story. If you liked the book, then definitely get this CD. If you like Jeff Johnson's work, start with his Albion CDs first, and then add this one to your collection so that your Jeff Johnson series is complete."
1,Pure castrist propaganda.,"Some years ago, a brazilian lend this book to me.It's a small and concise book.In fact the only quality of this bad book is his small size.All the rest are ridiculous Castro's propaganda.Well, I'm an (unemployed) brazilian agronomist.I must tell you that Cuba has nothing to teach about agriculture.In fact Castro's Cuba is, a complete agriculture failure.The big Cuba's crop is sugar.Well, in 1912, Cuba produced more sugar then in 2003,2004 and 2005.Cuba's experimente with organic agriculture was and is a failure.In fact, in Cuba, the general people has no flowing water, eletricity,etc.Outside privileges and money support to latin american marxists, Cuba's money goes to propaganda.And this is pure castrist propaganda."
1,Souz 26,"An awful CD. Probably one of the worst I have ever listened to. The music is bland, the songs are banal, and the overall effect is nauseating. Russian pop at its worst."
2,"Very cute and accurate, not very well constructed.","This costume is accurate to the cowardly lion, and very cute. This is not a well constructed piece. I had to return my first purchase because the material is so flimsy it was ripped. My daughter used this in a school play and it was a big success so I really have no complaints because overall she only used it for two days and it held up."
1,So cheap,This costume is so cheap looking in person that I didn't use it. I regret the purchase and had to buy another costume.
4,Fun costume,It wasn't very durable. But the quality of the head piece was amazing! Well worth the money. Great for a one time Halloween wearing. Wouldn't really work for anything more than that.
3,It is what it is,"I would not say this the best and well put together costume. When I got it I had to make some alterations so size it down a little. The material is very thin and will tear easy. The head paice is not well constructed at all. Overall though, it did what we needed. It made it through a school halloween party, a parade and then trick o treating. It is still in one peice and he put it in his costume closet for future use.... It was it is. Would I say worth every penny....Nope...But as I said it worked in a pinch"
2,"Not worth the money, very itchy",I found this costume not worth the money. It is cheaply made and very itchy around the face. Your child will be very uncomfortable.
1,Very flawed line of reasoning that ignores major truths,"In my view, the basic idea put forth in this book is at best a weak intellectual attempt to reconcile the concepts of Pre-destination with Free Will.Unfortunately, it is very flawed, both in Biblical support and in logical development. One of the major mistakes is that in focusing on Man's intended relationship with God, the authors totally ignore the reality of the spiritual battle between God and Satan that Man is central to. The conclusions drawn in this book have the potential to lead to dangerously flawed beliefs about our relationship with God.It's nice to have someone attempt to reconcile the issues mentioned above, but this is not the book to read if you want a real discussion from a Biblical and spiritual perspective.Bottom line: My opinion is that this book should not have been published"
1,Ultra-Arminians: Please re-examine your presuppositions,"Dear reader, don't let Laika from Western Sahara deter you from honest self-evaluation of your biases in favor of openness theology.Read the Bible for yourself and don't be taken in by the criticism in this book against traditional conservative christian beliefs about God's attributes.'Beyond the Bounds' and 'God Under Fire' are thought-provoking challenges to Ultra-Arminian philosophy by moderate Calvinists.No Open Theist has yet answered the objections to its liberal hermenutics."
1,An Unfortunate Publication,"This book is an attack not only on what historical theology has said about God, but on what God has said about Himself."
1,extremist Libertarianism fails the Bible test,"Just started reading it and already I can tell it's gonna be problematic.I was raised Catholic, then fell away from Christianity. I'm now going to a BGC church. From my perspective, the book just makes no sense. How God can not actually know for a fact what we will do next hour or next day or next month or next year?I've seen the prior reviews. I dont know Greek so thats no help.I use the New King James. I've also got my brother's commentary by F.F. Bruce on Gospel of John. From what it says, looks like ""I am"" is in John 13:19. ""He"" is in italics in my NKJV. The verse is really in the Bible. Its not patently dishonest after all. Its patently accurate.I may not finish the book. Depends on how far off the Bible it ends up being. But so far, not so good."
2,A good resource.,"The philosophy presented in this book is just that- philosophy. Pinnock fails to present any objective proof for open theism. The proof texts he cites are grossly taken out of context. All hermeneutical principles have been set aside. He fails to consider that his ""proof texts"" might in fact be anthropomorphisms. The ideas he presents are, to be frank, heretical. However, for any Christian who is truly seeking to know the Lord better, this book is a good read, for it provides insight into what kind of philosophies are being conjured up outside of orthodox theological circles. After reading this book, be sure to get a copy of Bruce Ware's response to it, ""God's Lesser Glory."""
5,Saved me from chemotherapy induced insomnia!!,"This book saved me when I has having chemotherapy and ended up with constant insomnia. I had not read about that as a side effect of breast cancer treatments until this book which has a good discussion of drugs usually used to treat breast cancer. I had read LOTS of books prior to my treatment and only this one mentioned drugs used to treat insomnia. If hadn't of known, I probably would still be staring at the ceiling ALL NIGHT wondering what the heck was going on!!!"
2,Lone voice of dissent,"I must be the only woman in America who didn't like this book -- I found it superficial and was disappointed that it didn't focus much on her own experiences. Plus there were some inconsistancies in her writing - the first time she mentions an incident, it was raining, later in the book, she recalls it being sunny -- minor, but it is sloppy editing. I read this around the time of my sent. node/lumpectomy/mastectomy surgeries in the fall of 2006. Went on to have chemo and rads, and I've read some 30 books on BC in an effort to be a well-informed patient. For my money, I'll takeDr. Susan Love's Breast Book:4th Edition 2005for info, and for personal experience, I liked Katherine Russell Rich'sThe Red Devil: To Hell with Cancer--And Backand Lila Petosi'sDancing With Fear: Tips and Wisdom from Breast Cancer SurvivorsBlessings to those of you who are starting your BC journey."
5,For My People,Excellent book (very difficult to find) sold at a very reasonable price. Fast delivery and receipt of item.
2,Finally!!!,"No matter how many times I try and read these books, they always bore the living hell out of me. I honestly don't know how people read these books. Finally, one book in the series didn't put me in practically a coma. And that was this one. Sure, I found myself nodding off a few times, but finally, I managed to get through one of these books without falling asleep. If I hadn't read this book, I'd give all of the books-.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 stars out of 5(if I could). But this one book managed to get the avarage up 2 stars considering it helped me do something i've never done before: Get through one of these boring, boring books."
4,Visor Sunglass Holder,"These weren't quite as pictured or what I was traditionaly used to. However they are more heavily constructed and do the job. The old ones never made a sound, these rattle a little at times while driving. These require greater pressure to the button to open them then the old style that was pictured. I noticed at Walmart Croakies makes a spring tension version of this device now that has no lock whatsoever. That store's version seems to be less innovative if that is the direction the company is taking. The ones here are preferable with the locking latch."
1,Broke immediately,"I have had these sunglasses holders before and they worked fine and held up for years. I bought 2 from this company and they both broke almost immediately. I contacted them and have not heard back. I still like the product, but this is lousy customer service."
2,Very Breakable,"The Shade Shack is a good idea and they work well when they are intact. However, there is weak spot near the point where the spring clip is attached. It is especially prone to failure on thicker sun visors. Two out of four have failed before I even had the chance to use them. Credit poor design or wrong choice of materials. Too bad, because it is a good idea."
3,"It's nice, but it does NOT include a comforter",The quality is good and the pattern is beautiful. But it does NOT have a comforter with filling as claimed in the description.
2,Could of been...better,"I have always try to give good reviews. I have always said if you can't say nothing positive about something, don't say it at all. However at a pricey tag, like this movie, I feel that I have to comment to future individuals interested on purchasing this movie. It is poorly made (definately for $55) and very short (for $55) and it feels like a business presentation instead of a descriptive ""what's happening"" in Cuba now. Nothing is said about places to stay or any ""fun places"" to go (other than a beach). Just a dissapointment to the upteen power. Sorry about this review, but this is honestly how I feel about it. Maybe worth $12 for it's history value! I wonder if I could get my $$ back!"
1,Could of...,"I bought it hoping that it would give you information rather than a bunch of primitive historic irrevelant points of views and comments. I could see it somewaht of a value at... I bought it, as I am about to travel to Havana, to get some information. It failed BIG TIME!"
1,Sucked,"I was so disappointed with this product, it was stupid, boring and had poor quality.A total waste of money.Disappointed Granny"
1,dissapointed,"The wires did not fit. The picture looked just like our slicer. so I ordered them, don't know what to do now."
4,Good not great,"I got the cheese slicer wires on time, but the issue is with installing it. This is not an issue with the wires, but the slicer. The hole the wire ends goes into is tough to get in. I spent many minutes to install the replacement wire. I'm glad I have the wires, just very hard to install. Good luck to you."
5,"My favorite ""alternative""","I am extremely fond of this performance as I am of many others currently available. Fischer-Dieskau has the most beautiful baritone voice ever recorded. Hearing this opera arranged for the lower voice is a treat. I happen to love many of the ""historical performance"" recordings available( an early one with Rene Jacobs as Orpheus with La Petite Bande). I like the Gardinier version and I have seen the Met Opera version with David Daniels in the title role, a performance I truly adored! But I also like this one. I like a variety of interpretations and this example is my favorite"" diversion"" for this most beautiful and glorious opera."
5,Just right,"This play is a meaningful, and yet almost simple, masterpiece. The story unfolds with the death of a gay man, which ultimately brings an unlikely match closer together. Wilson's use of homosexual issues is the perfect sprinkling: it is not the main focus of the play, but gives it just the extra touch. This is how homosexuality should be written about in the theatre (or any form of entertainment). It isn't over-played or under-played, but just right."
2,Disapointment...,"Another prove that appearances are deceptive. It was a blind buy. Liked the design, color, and the way this perfume looked: really cool and fresh. After reading description of notes of this fragrances thought it would suit me. Was very wrong. It's not refreshing. All crisp and fresh notes are gone in 1 min. After that, cloying sweetness and spiciness last forever..."
1,Failed the S+ Exam,"I studied the text - all 17 chapters and the Appendix, then I took every one of The included study CD-based CertBlaster ""Subject matter drills"", then all 4 of the exams (passing every one on the first pass, and coming very close to perfection on the 2nd pass on any given test.)I took AND FAILED the S+ exam today. ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE STUDY TOOLS, THE TEXT BOOK, AND THE PRACTICE TEST WITH THE REAL TEST WERE RARE!!!! I basically wasted a week and several hundred dollars.BTW. The Comptia S+ Exam was probably one of the worst knowledge measurement tools (e.g. exam) that I have EVER taken - and I have taken a huge number of them....Just FYIWill Harper, MCSE (NT 3,51/NT 4/W2K/XP), MCT, CCNA, A+, N+, CTT+ (and a bunch of other certs) AAS(IT/Networking), BSEE(computers), MBA."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK - WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I am a network engineer with almost 10 years experience. I have typically shied away from certification tests because I have always found them to be of the ""right answer, wrong answer and TEST ANSWER"" category. Security+ is absolutely no different but my job required that I take this certification. I signed up for a class at the local college and this was the textbook for that class.I read the book cover to cover twice, skimmed it twice more, answered the end-of-chapter questions, took the practice exam included on the cd over 20 times and passed everytime with scores 85% and higher. I failed the security+ exam. The difference between the questions on the test and the topics in this book was amazing. DO NOT RELY ON THIS HORRIBLE BOOK TO GET YOU THRU THE TEST. IT IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.If I could have given it negative stars, I would."
1,Cheese,"This textbook does not cover the material in the Security+ Exam. Entire test subjects are not included, and the lab exercises are terrible. The lab manual only includes a few useful labs and some of them are so outdated they are irrelevant. Authors contradict each other, and the chapters do not hold together well. If you're looking for a lightweight topical introduction, this may work for you, but it won't help you pass the certification exam. This is a very weak introduction to network security, and there are better books available that do cover the content you need to pass the exam. Consider instead ""Principles of Computer Security: Security+ and Beyond"" ISBN: 0072255099"
1,A Horribly Inadequate Security Book,"What a waste of my money! This book didn't help me learn security hardly at all. Why? Well, I'll give you several reasons.First of all, the book is written by several authors and it shows. They frequently contradict each other, even on definitions of terms, and the material overlaps so much it's like deja vu.The other major problem is that the explanations in the book are horrible and disjointed. Concepts and terms are referenced as if the reader already knows them--even though they aren't explained until later on.And let's not forget the typos and poor English that dot this book. Was this even edited before going to press? I am so completely dissatisfied with this textbook. It's not valuable for anything except maybe firewood. I didn't take the Security+ test, but I can tell this book would be woefully useless for it. Avoid this item!"
1,"Bad organization, mistakes and lack of details",This is probably one of the worst books I have ever used. Material is repeated verbatum several times over and the labs are the same in several chapters. Concepts are not explained clearly and in varying degrees. The edition I had was riddled with mistakes that even novice users were able to pick out. Worst of all is the organization - it looks like the authors just copied and pasted everything toghether. This book will definately not prepare you for the exam and is a pain to read.
1,Incomplete and Poorly Written,"This book will not even half-prepare you for Security+. There are many missing subjects and terms that are essential to passing the exam. This book completely misses its mark and to top it off, the author does a very poor job of explaining technical concepts. My advice, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK unless you need some interesting toilet paper or bonfire fodder!!"
3,I should have gone with an outdoor rug instead,"This product is much thinner than I expected. I brought this for my 10' x 16' enclosed patio. After receiving the mat and allowing it to sit for a few days to eliminate the shipping wrinkles, I secured it to the deck with the provided screws and washers. Unfortunately, the screw heads were too small for the washers and I had to make a run to Home Depot for the properly sized materials.The mat is made from what appears to be a cheap plastic. It reminds me of the material that they use to make plastic deck umbrellas. Overall, this product is ""just okay"". I will most likely purchase an indoor/outdoor rug to replace this."
1,Horrible,"This doc is almost unbearably boring. Nothing new is said. ""The Most Anticipated Wrestling Doc of All-time?"" Just a lame gimmick, and obviously a worked one from the beginning. Do not waste your money."
5,amazing!,Bloodstained Memoirs Special Edition is finally coming to North America! woop woop! Finally we are getting the extended version! I heard its also available on iTunes and Playstation.
2,NOT SO GOOD!!!!!,"The DVD presentation, that is. Phantom of Chinatown is in pretty good acceptable shape, but can be found on the Mr. Wong series set. Phantom Killer is a butchered re-issue missing lots of footage. Phantom of 42nd Street is splicy."
1,You get what you pay for,"I got two of these cables. Both cause extremely ghosted images. This might be able to be cleared up with a circular magnet, but I haven't tried it yet."
4,Satisfied,"Book got here very quickly, but is completely written in. Book description did not indicate this."
3,Spanish book review,"Good fast shipping, interior of book was fine, outside was a little rough..but serves a collage students purpose."
4,An attempt at John Corigliano,"This is difficult to rate. Please note that this score is VERY DIFFERENT from Howard Shore's other work. As noted, it is bombastic and progressive in nature, as if Howard Shore was trying to emulate the work of John Corigliano. If you liked the score to Altered States, this one is a must. If you are looking for scores like Silence of the Lambs, pass it by."
4,ambiance abounds,"Following the theme of the movie, the soundtrack darks and haunting. Well scored, the sense of darkness of a killers mind seeps out of the tracks, infectiously haunting in its sound. I must applaud the use of middle eastern instruments, which is not common. Overall: excellent music for reading Lord Byron or Poe. Not reccomened for the paranoid. And if your of the daring type, fall asleep with it on but beware of what you dream. Just remeber, its not real."
4,Changing with times,"Surprisingly to me and many other Tito Allen fans, he broke away from his true musical roots in this album. One has to remember this album was released in 1991, the romantic salsa era and this was an adventure into a different land for him. I have to say I'm not the biggest fan of this music, but have to admit that he did a worthy job on this album. The music (instrument wise) is similar that of Luis Enrique (one of my favorites of that era). His smooth voice easily adapts to different styles so its not that hard to enjoy it. Still sad to see one of the oldies trade salsa dura and hard for me to coupe with too. I am mixed between 3 or 4 stars. For the sake of choosing I give it 4."
3,Not for the timid or easily offended (or even the not so easily offended),"This album goes from avant-garde to pop and everywhere in between. There are obvious Zappa influences, but this music is more confrontational than most Zappa stuff; the lyrics (mostly spoken rather than sung) will probably offend most people. But if you enjoy in-your-face experimental rock/jazz-ish music (and in-your-face lyrics), you might enjoy this album. Good luck finding it."
2,Disappointing; Workouts Are Things That Everybody Already Knows,"Though I do admit that this was a GREAT workout and really got the blood pumping, the video was produced unprofessionally and the workouts given were made up of very simple exercises. For example, a workout included things such as burpees, pushups, punches, and kicks. Though this did get my heart rate up, I realized I could have simply performed these exercises without the DVD. Also, the DVD is made unprofessionally, as John Hackleman often stutters and seems to have a hard time finding something to say. Chuck Liddell also is not even used in the video; he is simply used to advertise the DVD."
5,No joke,"This workout is no joke, and it improved my cardio/conditioning in my martial arts training almost immediately. The Pit Master is hilarious, but I still hate him for putting me through these TOUGH workouts!!!"
1,What workout?,"This is the worst workout video I have ever seen. I generally like the fighting type workouts but this was completely disjointed, no real instruction. The people in the video just do whatever they want for a given amount of time. They can't even manage to do jumping jacks in sync. You don't really get any cardio from this if you just follow their instruction, which are slim to none. Sure you can shadow box for great cardio (and I do) but why do I need this video to tell me to do it when they don't give any pointers at all? Pfft, I'll set my own timer and shadow box, thanks."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worse workout DVD's I've purchased, it's worse than the workouts on Exercise TV. You ""shadow box"" for ten minutes and do jumping jacks and wierd neck ""stretches"" I don't feel any cardio is incorporated into this DVD other than the jumping jacks. I was looking for something to give me an at home cardio workout and a break from Insanity but I'll just go right back to Insanity. I'd rather run on the treadmill than do this workout DVD."
2,It will get you in shape.,If you are looking to get in shape this dvd will do it. Tae Bo kind of workout. I really didn't find it very challenging. I would rather just stick with the Bas Rutten MMA Workout out on CD or I also would stick to Matt Furey Combat Conditioning. Those are real hardcore workout for the mixed martial artists.
1,I am not sure how great the DVD is because it arrived SCRATCHED !!,"The problem is the DVD case. The inside prongs do nto hodl the DVD so in shipment the DVDs move all around and the prongs scratch them up. The DVDs will go to menu fine but then just freezes up and skips around. Poor DVD case ! DO not buy it yet, wait for the next waves of THE PIT WORKOUT once all the bad dvd cases get bought out."
3,Its OK,"I think the workouts are very effective for getting in shape for martial arts or for general fitness. JH is a bad dude and I respect his qualifications as a trainer, but there is a lack of motivation to follow his lead. He is very likeable and works his ass off, but he lacks enthusiasm or something..anyways, just my opinion. Bottom line is the workouts are really good if you need a change from your regular program. It includes lots of pushups, body weight exercises, and shadow boxing; So if you don't integrate fighting style training in your workout routine, then I recommend it as a supplement to other workout programs. Even though I rate this program as just ok I would like to purchase Crosspit and give it a chance. In conclusion, if you want to take fitness to another level, do this with Bas Ruttens workout cds and p90x and you won't be disappointed."
5,The most intense workout I have ever done,"I have purchased several products on amazon but have rarely been compelled to write a review--the Pit Workout is the most notable exception. First off, I like to work hard at the gym with weight training and cardio four days a week. I really thought I was in shape but the Pit DVD immediately made clear this WAS NOT the case! The first day--the upper body workout--absolutely destroyed me. I was panting, shaking my head in disbelief, vomitted three times, and experienced biting muscle soreness even before the workout was over. The other two workouts were no different. This is a GREAT program that will truly leave you feeling as if you have accomplished something; the thing is just an onslaught that never quits! HIGHLY recommedned!"
3,Not so great,Works great and at a great price!!Works great and at a great price!!Works great and at a great price!!Works great and at a great price!!Works great and at a great price!!yes
2,It's ok,"I like it somewhat. But it just seems so poorly done. The guy doesn't seem to put much effort into the whole thing and does nothing to push you. Everyone is doing some random deal so you could do better not watching the video since that would just distract you. Compared to the ""Bas Rutten workout"" which I recieved recently for my birthday, this just doesn't cut it.If you can provide your own motivation and see pass the faults then go ahead and knock yourself out. I enjoy the ""BR Workout"" much more and get a better work out to boot."
4,Perfect for everyday fashion!,"I just love the Everyday Fashions series because there are so many different designs. In other fashion history or resource books, there are usually only a couple of examples. This book has women, men, teens, kids... I think anyone who is a costumer, or enjoys creating vintage repros should own these books."
4,Great,The book is in good condition! Arrived on time and the price is wonderful. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would definitely consider do it again some time soon.
5,I'm in to retro fashion anyway,I love the book. I use it to give me inspiration for my designs. It's a good reference book.
1,just too thin,"The content is about as non-existent as the waistlines on those cartoon supermodels of the day. Maybe if you profiteers glued together a few more decades worth of content, it might be worth the price of the postage."
3,A bit dissapointing.,"When you Andy Montañez, Luisito Carrion, Don Perignon, and Gilberto Santa Rosa on cover of an album, one thinks this must be great. At least that's what I thought. I found this album to be just... bland. A remake of ""Bambarakatunga"" by Primi Cuz is pretty good, as well as ""Quemando Leña"" which starts off really slow, but picks up half-way. There's also ""Represento"", just recently redone by La Puerto Rican Power and sung by Jose Feliciano which is a much much better version than the one recorded by La Puertorriqueña (really recommend this song). I have to say I was really looking forward to this one when reading that Mario Ortiz, Humberto Ramirez and the rest of a truly all-star cast got together. Sadly the music is by no means remarkable as I found it really monotonous and just really uninspiring. Not saying that the album is horrible, but it is not good either. Definitely a sign of how salsa had changed by 1991."
3,it coud be better than it is,"This book could be much better than it is. It contains many details about ancient Greece of the classical period taken from the literature (quotes from classic sources are in most cases interesting and properly chosen) and also archaeological sources. But style of this book is horribly dry, what makes this book even boring."
5,A Set of Novels Ahead of their Time,"I read Ludell as well as Ludell and Willie numerous times through the years and loved it each and every time. I thought of it again fondly recently as I finished THE HELP, thinking how the topic of race relations between the black help and white employers had been covered very similarly in Ludell's story many years before. The book was similar to The Help with it's treatment of the dialogue and the southern setting. However, the maid/employer backdrop was simply a minor story line here versus the whole point of The Help. I hope that Brenda Wilkinson knows what a powerful set of books she wrote, such wonderful characters and what an impact she had on children, black and white."
2,It was okay.,"It was okay,but not very fun.My mom didn't like it,and I don't like it either.I do not want to offend any Bratz fan,but Dana is skimpy and not for me."
2,They could do better!!!!,"I think MGA Entertainment could do better than this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Her make up is soooo lame and so is her clothes but i LOVE Bratz and always will, even if they make another ugly one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,BRATZ,"Bratz are such a wanna'be and a copy catter. Barbie will always be the best because she's original and has inspired little girls all around the world. Bratz are definitely opposite. I see no good inspiration in them and they have bad influences on little girls. They have lots of unmoddest clothes which has inspired lots of girls that I know to dress the way the bratz do, including my little sister and her friend."
5,LETS GET IT STRAIGHT......,"DOLLS ARE NOT ROLE MODELS!You must be damn crazy; letting your kids look up to a doll as a role model! people are role models; NOT toys. Get it straight, now....M~"
2,This is the worst Dana EVER!,This is a really poor excuse for a Brat. Her clothes are ugly and her lips don't look good with red on. I think Winter Wonderland Dana or whatever its called is the best. But this Dana is horible. I DON'T RECOMEND HER!
3,Rip off (sort of),"Well, i don't know a lot of those things since i don't have it. But it looks like it isn't very educational. It doesn't look like it has much stuff though! although it is cheap."
4,Dana meets Jade,"Usually, Dana is a sweet, sophisticated character in the Bratz pack, as her nickname is ""Sugar Shoes"". In the Bratz! Funk Out collection, Dana took on the role of ""Punk of the pack!"" This Dana screams punk and rock chick mixed together! The make up is WILD and so are the clothes. Her lips are a bit too dark, but that does not matter. It looks like Jade lent'Dana some fashion tips for this collection! She isn't the best, but she is sure close to it. The Funk Out collection is very simple, yet very funky, and gorgeous. Buy this doll. Kids and collectors will love her."
1,Um...................no,"Okay.........WHAT HAPPENED?!This doll looks ready for the circus.She looks like a [...] baboon!I do not recommend her at all.Her clothes are [...] and she looks like a BARBIE gone wrong.....*shudders*.Dont get me wrong I love bratz but I really think Sasha and Yasmin funk-outs are a better choice.I also love Dana(i have prom Dana)but her hair,clothes,and make-up would work on Jade.Dana is a sweetie please dont change her MGA!"
1,Rated by a Bratz fan,"I think this is a poor excuse for a bratz. She dosn't even look cool! Her makeup is way to dark, and her hair looks like she just rolled out of bed!!! Her clothes are okay.i like the other styles of Bratz more. Like the Strut It! collection, they look cooler and more realistic, or more like something you or i would wear."
4,This Dana is GREAT!,"This is a great Dana. She has the coolest hair, including a style and highlights, plus her clothes are nice! I really like her skirt.I don't know why everyone says ""this dana is bad"" cause she is a doll, and shouldn't be looked up to.She comes with quite a few accsesories, but they aren't really for people who loose things easy, and sometimes they break, like the earrings are pretty cheap.But, all in all, this doll is quite a nice buy. I think she is a wonderful valaue for ?15 (English).If you like Dana, then buy this doll.* b r a t z f a n *Gemmap.s. She is better in real life, cause the amazon photo's are quite rubbish."
1,This can not be Dana,This does not look like Dana(I have and reviewed Girls nite out Dana)the clothes look like something a flava doll would wear I mean come on! MGAE was not thinking when thay made this doll!
1,This Doll is just Sickining!,"She wears the shortest skirts possible and her suspenders are like identicals to my marching band uniform suspenders (I am dead serious) and she can not sport the British Flag! I think she is ugly and her lipstick is a few shades too dark! Also she is wearing what looks like [..] heals! She really looks like a [..! This doll is a disgrace to all dolls! My aunt immidiatly returned it when my cousin got it in a grab bag at a holiday party! So Moms beware! Some Bratz are okay, but this one is Awful!!!!"
3,Adequate for the price,"I bought this for a multi cultural event at the college I work at and for indoor purposes, this is a good product. However, I would strongly recommend against using this outdoors, even in a covered area; I made that mistake with a few other flags and they were faded and largely destroyed within 18 months. Still, these sorts of flags were never rated for outdoor use so for the purpose intended, they are fine."
2,Lots of chatter in wood and metal,"This bit chatters like crazy when used in wood/metal and makes rough countersinks in an octegon shape. It chatters some when used with a drill press, but is aweful when used with a handheld drill. If you're in a pinch or using it for construction work, then it will give you semi-adequate countersinks. But if you are doing fine woodwork and need pretty countersinks, then this tool is not the one to use.I used this with a handheld drill for holes I made in a piece of steel sheet metal. This bit chattered like crazy and made terrible countersinks. It was so bad that I had to file the holes smooth again. It may work better in a dril press, but I have other countersinks that work better with a handheld drill than this one."
5,Courage for all Cancer Overcomers,"This book was originally sent to me by Dave Dravecky back in 1993 when my 15 year old son died of cancer. I have used it as a devotional off and on through my own battles with cancer. I have a gene defect that makes me prone to many types of cancer and am currently battling pancreatic cancer, my fifth primary. I sent this copy of the book to my 24 year old daughter who had double mastectomies a few weeks ago. The stories are short and encouraging."
1,Not a Review but a question,"Did anyone else have a problem playing this DVD? I tried to play it on 2 different (Samsung) blu-ray players and the picture was jerky and no sound. It played fine on my newphew's xbox. I did pick the ""stereo"" option. Maybe it was only me but it's something to be aware of."
1,No proofreading?,First off does anyone know if there has been corrections noted on the web some place? The books is riddled with mistakes. At first I was ecstatic the format was straight forward and easily read. Later none of the books steps corresponded to previous steps. That is unless you close the previous lesson that you have worked through and then open the next sessions pre-prepared version.
5,Best I tried,"I purchased both Adobe's Classroom in a Book and this one. By far, this is the best book for someone getting started with what is a high learning curve piece of software. Based solely on this book, I was able to produce a 28 minutes promotional video for a group trip to Portugal.Once having finished this book, it would then be worthwhile to go ahead an work with Adobe's Classroom in a Book. I certain do not recommend the CIB as the place to start.Working through this book was a pleasure. I say that as a retired teacher who during my career authored three marketing textbooks. If you are getting started with Premiere Pro--this is the place to start."
5,Awesome book!!!,"This book is full of color pictures, and great stories about thow they got the cars for this great movie! I own a Honda S2000 and I used the book in my car on the day of the car show. I highly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed!"
5,INTERESTING LOOK BEHIND THE SCENES,I love tuner cars and I'm always fascinated by how movies are made. This book puts the two together with a lot of good photos.
1,Come on....,"You know, you'd think by watching this show Demons were hiding in every nook and cranny. Talk to anyone who legitimately investigates the paranormal and you'll find that encountering a genuine demonic force is rare. Talk to the catholic church and ask how many exorcisms have been performed in the last decade. Not many. Yet this show seems set on the notion that almost every haunting is somehow demonic. Personally I think that Ryan's personal religious views get in his way of being an impartial investigator, and that is why he so frequently cries ""Demon""."
2,ups and downs,"This ring was very pretty and a great deal, but one of the side stones has fallen out already. I've had the ring about a month and never wore it around the house. It was pretty enough that I'm considering ordering another one, though!"
4,Very nice for the money,"This is a very cute ring, and well worth the money. It wasn't the most beautiful ring I have ever seen, but I do like it and it is very pretty. For the money spent I have no regrets."
3,Ok for the money,"I purchased this ring at a discounted price in my Quick Picks. Best thing I can say is that I didn't spend a lot of money on it. I mean, yes, it's silver. The middles stone (garnet) is pretty nice. But the side stones are really pale in color. From a distance, it almost looks like they are missing. Very dull and lack luster. Would make a nice gift for a child, but don't spend over $15 or so for it or you may be disappointed."
2,light weight,I found this set of flatware to be to light weight for my taste. Would be ok for a beach cabin or camping set.
5,What did I find?,"I just picked this book off of the shelf at the local library because the colourful cover caught my eye. That reminder about 'Judging' and 'Book covers' went through my head. I read it, and was intrigued. This book is great! It is very complex and has lots of twists and turns I never expected."
2,LA daisy gal,"Conceptual writing is mean't (emphasis on mean) for screenplays. So here is the same scene problem, oh I mean the problem seen time and time again..let the writers write the books and the storytellers like Eggers cross over and do the deed."
1,Not a good wheel,"I tried this wheel with a Ford racing game. It has an excessive center dead spot. I tried to adjust it for finer control and it could not. It just does not respond until the wheel has been turned a significant distance to either side, which causes one to end up overcompensating and then losing control. Not at all realistic. Not fun.Might be better with another game? I am not willing to try it by buying another game."
2,hard to control,"I bought this wheel for 50 bucks art Walmart. I didn't much care for this wheel, it is nothing like really driving. It is not easy to control your vehicle at all. It sucks. I am now going to buy another one, I am going with Logitech instead, hopefully I will have better luck."
1,junk!,"I own one of these, I bought it to use for Gran Turismo 4, did not work well at all. I thought about mounting it on brackets so it didnt slide arond from my knees moving to use the brake and accelerator, but whats the point when you have to turn the wheel 1 1/2 inches (measured from outer part of the wheel) to get any response and when i do it causes me to spin out. junk!"
1,DOES NOT EVEN GET POWER!!!,"This wheel is horrible. I have it for my PS2, and it did not even have power. But then I pluged it into my friends Gamecube, and it worked, but did not feel that great. I strongly discurage anyone to buy this wheel!"
2,Not Byrd's Best,"Having read ""Jackson, A novel"" first, I was very disappointed with this effort. And it takes some effort to struggle through this book. Little insight is provided into the enigmatic Jefferson. The character is not well developed and the book lacks pace, being mired in insipid detail. The members of the supporting cast are presented as effete sycophants or sybarites. Even the illicit relationships lack spice. In all fairness, the book may have spark interest in some as a period piece, but it didn't do much for me. I loved ""Jackson"", was not impressed with ""Jefferson"", but I look forward to ""Grant"" with much anticipation."
2,brooding and smutty,"Byrd has done an excellent job of putting the French Revolution into the context of the American Revolution. I enjoyed the perspectives of the impressionable young Short and his master Jefferson on the situation in Paris leading up to the Revolution. However, this book never quite takes flight, and Byrd devolves into sordid descriptions of Jefferson's and Short's daliances with married women. The reader is shortchanged by the suggestion that the complexities of these men is driven by their lewd behavior. The smuttiness does not end here. Byrd chronicles the seedy side of Paris through the exploits of Jefferson's slave James. James's ineveitable request of emancipation is driven by his desire to participate in the circus-like excess of Paris, much to my disappointment. Although I learned much about the hypocrisy of Jefferson, the burden of reading this book far outweighed the lessons of this great man. The plot never quite develops and the dialogue is very inconsistent."
1,2 of 2 Bits Extremely Dull,"I purchased two of these drill bits for use with my Hole Hawg while wiring my new house. I've used Irwin bits in the past with good results, and these seemed like a good deal. My old brand M bit lasted about half-way into the project (about 250 holes through studs/joists), when it started getting dull, so I switched over to one of the new Irwin bits. It was so dull out of the package that it would barely drill a hole, with considerably more effort than my old, worn bit. I then tried the other new Irwin bit, and it started ok, but after 5 holes it wouldn't drill, either. It's almost like Irwin missed heat treating the bits. At that point, I went to my local Home center and purchased a new brand M bit which I used for wiring the remainder of my house without any issues.Unfortunately, enough time had lapsed between when I bought these bits and when I tried using them, that I was outside the Amazon return period, so I'm stuck eating the cost."
5,Good auger bit,"Was a little suspicious about the low price when ordered. Finally I'm very pleased with the purchase - typical Irwin quality auger bit (not Bosh, of course) but made in Brasilia (that explains the price). Will not cut nails but going through the wood, plastics and composites very well."
4,The best,I found this book amazingly good!!! It was a mysterious suspenseful book! Every chapter finished with another mysterious possibility. I finished it in less than a week that is how good it was!!!!
5,A Exciting Cliffhanger,"Betheny, a 12 year old girl gets dropped off with her Aunt Myrlie witch she never even met with no warning.She went through weird behaviors before with her parents such as,ucontrollable crying from from her mother and sadness from her father.But,then weird stuff happens like her mom calls but instead of saying Hi, Bethany she called her ""Elizebeth"".Who is Elizebeth?and Why is everyone acting so weird?These questions and more are all answered in the book!"
5,Absolute Genius!,"This is not the first MPH book that I had read. But, by far, it ranks among my favorite books of all time.It has a science fiction twist to it, and, though I never really liked Sci-Fi, I loved this book. Margaret Peterson Haddix takes you to a setting that will thrill you and keep you at the edge of your seat, wondering who Bethany is and who Elizabeth is.I definitely recommend it and think that anyone, old or young, would appreciate that wit and cleverness involved in this book."
3,christinaa <33,"How would you feel if you just found out you were going to go live with your aunt that you have never met before? Well that is what happens in the fictional book Double Identity, by Margaret Peterson Haddix. Bethanym Cole`s birthday is coming up and her parents are acting very strange. Her mother is always crying and her dad never talks anymore. One day they decided to leave Bethant with her Aunt Myrlie who she never met. Shes finds out she has a sister named Elizabeth who died 20 years ago. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes fictional books and mysterious books. I liked this book because it was suspensful and mysterious. I would like to read more books by this author. =]"
3,A page-turner.,"Right before her 13th birthday, Bethany's parents drop her off with an aunt she has never met. They leave her with no explanation and no way to contact them. Bethany's questions lead her to discover more family secrets than she ever imagined her boring parents could have. Who is Bethany--really? The answer to that question might well destroy her forever.A quick and suspenseful read."
5,Haddix's Best Book Ever,"This is probably Margaret Peterson Haddix's best book ever. I finished the entire book in a little less than 5 days- I couldn't put it down! It is about a girl named Bethany whose parents are all of a sudden acting strange- her mother is crying all the time and her father barely lets her out of his sight. Suddenly, Bethany and her family pile in the car and drop her off at her Aunt Myrlie's house, a woman who Bethany has never heard about before. Her parents do not give her a specific date when they will return for her and all her father says is that he is leaving her here to get help for her mother. So many things happen at Myrlie's house- she hears the name Elizabeth, people react to her as if they've seen a ghost, she finds out that Myrlie has a husband and a daughter (well, she HAD a husband), and so much more. There are so many twists in the book that it will grab your attention from beginning to end!"
5,A Kid's Review,This book was so interesting! It keeps you guessing right down to the startling conclusion. Double Identity is about a girl named Bethany. Her parents have been acting very strangely. Then one day without warning they drive her across several states to stay with an aunt she has never met. Bethany's only clue is someone named Elizabeth whom her parents and aunt secretly talk about. She must use this and other clues she finds along the way to discover a shocking secret about her own past.This was another great book by an awsome author. I recomend it for people interested in science fiction and mysteries!
5,AMAZING (as usual),"When I started reading this book, I was insantly hooked. It is very fast paced, so you don't have to wait forever for the action to start. I wouldnt be suprized if something like this hasn't happened in real life. Highly recomended!"
4,Double Identity,"Double identity- the book that will have 8-12 year olds staying up late into the night desperatley trying to finish.Summary: when Bethany Cole is dropped off at an aunts house that she didn't know existed, she is very worried. Her father claims that he needs to get help for Bethanys mother, who is crying often, and is obviously very unstable. At first, Bethany and her aunt do not get along. But as Bethany uncovers secrets about her parents that are too confusing to handle, Bethany and her aunt bond as they try to uncover the mystery of Bethanys and her and her parents past.Haddix has done it again by intricately weaving a thought provoking novel. Although my inner critic says that the character Bethany was a little bland, and so was the aunt.All and all, Margaret Peterson Haddix has created a creative book that will be a very intriguing read."
4,Holds your interest,"In Double Identity, Bethany is a 12 year old girl whose goes to live with her aunt, where she soon finds out she is unable to contact her parents and wonders if she'll ever see them again. Not sure why everyone treats her oddly when they see her, she eventually discovers that she is a clone of her dead sister Elizabeth. She tries to create her own identity seperate from Elizabeth, and soon discovers that there's someone hunting for her to reveal her to the world for his own evil purposes. While the book does hold your interest, there's not a lot of action, which I expected to happen once we find out someone is after Bethany. For that reason, I gave the book four stars instead of five. Otherwise, I recommend the book. I also recommend The Giver and An Audience for Einstein, two other young adult books that hold your interest."
5,Another great book!,Although this is a mystery...I guessed most of them. Regardless the book was still a major page turner!!!
1,"Not worth the money, Only 2 component inputs","I found this box while searching the internet for a similar device to extend my TV's 2 component video inputs. Only 2 component video inputs for $165. Come on? Don't bother! Buy the 5-DEVICE Component Video & Digital Audio Switcher by Acoustic Research, Audio Authority 1154 or the PELICAN PL957(if you can find one, every store in America is out of them). I don't recommend the JVC's under $150. I heard the video quality is not good. The red color's are not accurate. I ended up buying the CE Labs SW104HD 4 in 2 out component A/V switcher after 3 weeks of research and review reading. They average about $135 online. I'll let you know how I like it after a month of use."
1,Sima processor,"The product never worked properly. The voltage regulator in the DC supply would overheat and shut down after a short period of time. When I contacted the company on the problems I experienced, they questioned my operation of the product. I have over 25 years of experience in the electronics industry and was a manager of an large electronics repair operation. I ended up tossing the product and writing off the loss."
5,Auto enthusiast must have!,"This is simply one of the greatest car mags in any country. It focuses simply on performance models of all price ranges. Printed on big, thick, shiney quality paper but rather pricey. Why does the subscription price cost more than the newstand though? Most US car magazines will have maybe one feature on a desirable sports car, but my last issue of EVO had stories about Enzo Ferrari, Pagani Zonda, Ford GT, Porsche Carrera GT, and a 600+ hp Benz. The writers are very entertaining and no article ever bores you."
5,The evoness of evo,"Like a lot of Brit car magazines, this one may strike U.S. readers as a bit pretentious. But I like it better than CAR or Top Gear (or most U.S. auto mags) because it doesn't clutter up its editorial pages with reviews of minivans, pickups and SUVs. Instead, it chooses and gives star-ratings to mostly sports cars and sports sedans, with a few econoboxes/""super-minis"" thrown in, on the basis of their interest to and satisfaction of performance enthusiasts. They call this quality ""evoness"" and it describes how I judge cars...."
4,From the cover,"From the back of the book:A handy resource for preaching and teaching, the author considers three favorit Old Testament stories and texts (Ruth, Esther, and Jonah). She offers teachers and preachers a commentary resource for study and provides research and insight into these most popular biblical characters. Designed for quick reference, this book is ideal for group Bible study and as a preaching resource and guide."

1,bAD dEAL,Thought i was getting a deal but i guess i didnt read the bottom line. Lap top computer delivered with no power cord and no hard drive. did return finally 10/12................Hoping i get my money back
2,"Great sound, but DEFECTIVE","Like other reviewers, I just experienced the maximum volume problem with my Athena iVoice. I turned on the system and the volume went to maximum and would not go down. Totally NOT COOL as we use it in our twin babies' nursery! The volume buttons on top of the unit are unresponsive. I finally was able to lower the volume using the remote (once I found it) but the buttons still don't work.AVOID."
3,disapoint with its sound performance,"well, i should say, it's not that good as what i think it would be. it loses a lot when people singing. it is not worthy of the price."
2,"Decent, but that's about all",The remote does not work unless you point it exactly where it wants. And the sound quality is just decent. Not a huge fan of it. Good thing it's outside on the porch.
4,Excellent speakers,"I bought this product because of the reviews, styling and the price (around fifty dollars). It has excellent reviews, including an A- rating from iLounge. The speakers do not distort the sound, have good volume and more than enough bass for my tastes, and are really compact and good looking.One thing that you should be aware of is that when you connect an iPhone 2G, it shows the message ""This accessory is not made to work with iPhone"". Everything works, though, and it even charges the iPhone, but the message is a bit annoying.Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. They are perfect for my apartment's living room (~220 sq feet)."
3,Far from Spectacular,"I bought the iVoice through this page last month and when it arrived, I plugged it in and there was instantly a crackle through the speaker. Used it for a few days to see if I could live with it and ultimately decided the sound quality wasn't good enough to warrant dealing with the static. Be sure that if you order this, you pay attention to the 14-day return policy. When I called to return it, the guy at Vann's told me that several people had actually had the same problem as I did. So, if your main priority is spending the least money possible, go ahead, but be warned that you may really get what you pay for. I can say that if you do need to return it, the customer service at Vann's was excellent."
5,Worth the money,"I have had this product for a couple years now. This turned out to be a great product. It is no longer sold, but I would buy another Anthena product based on my experience with this one."
2,Buyer Beware,"I've had the unit for about a year now, but only paid about $50 for it. About six months ago it developed a volume problem. When the unit is first turned it goes to full volume. It will also sometimes turn on all by itself, at full volume, durring a thunderstorm. The sound quality is pretty good though, especially for the price. I like bass, but find the iVoice a little too bass heavy. I usually wind up using the bass reducer function on my iPod. I would have given it 4.5 stars if not for the volume issue."
2,trouble with volume control,"Sound is great - however, right when my one-year warrantee was up the volume control went out making it nearly useless."
4,Not bad sound for the price,"This speaker is an improvement from the other smaller speaker, but it still not a Boose. We've a big room with 13 ft ceiling, and this unit delivered okay sound."
4,exactly what I thought I was getting.,"This works great for what I wanted. it plays fine in my bathroom, and is simple to move around as I need.the sound is good. the product is durable. It does this weird thing where the volume of my ipod moves around up and down when I'm not doing anything, but it doesn't effect the sound coming out of the speakers. also looks really good. I don't see a need to pay more so go for it."
1,Does not work with 3G iPods,This product simply does not work with 3G iPods. Once docked the iPod does not respond to any controls and freezes up. This should be stated in the product description and on the manufacturers web site. There are plenty of other buyers who have seen the same results - search Google.
3,Great sound for the price with a few quirks,"We bought 3 of these units from a Washington-based warehouse store. After setting them up the first thing we noticed was that the volume on each of the units started at 11. It was quite jarring. We've since found that if a unit is unplugged the volume will reset to the maximum at power up. If you don't unplug the until this shouldn't be a problem. The sound from the ivoice is excellent for it's size. It works with and charges our iPods and iPhones. The remote control is pretty quirky. The volume control works well, but skipping forward or backward doesn't work very well if at all.One of our units lost the left channel about a week after the return period expired. It still works as a charger though.In summary, for the price of a bluray disc they are a good value and sound great. But you will have to put up withthe volume and remote control quirks."
5,Very happy with this stereo!!,"I love it! Good sound for a decent price, very convenient to use and a nice look. I'm glad I got this one!"
4,good!,"has great sound quality and can be very loud. def worth the price. the only drawback is that it has to be plugged in to an outlet (isnt portable). but if you dont mind that, its a good buy!"
5,A Tremendous Value,"After vetting a number of iPod speaker systems, I chose the Athena iVoice for use with my iPod Touch. The Athena's USB connection and video output functions are incompatible with the iPod Touch, but I have little use for either of those functions anyway, and for less than $50, the iVoice is simply unparalleled by any measure. The sound quality is astoundingly good (see Moonchilde's review of June 2007), the design and build quality are excellent, and everything (including the nice little remote) has worked flawlessly for me. BTW...the iVoice is far more stylish than the photos might suggest, and has a nice quality look and feel. Bottom line: I couldn't be more pleased."
3,Probably Not,"I went for this Athena unit based on price, the reviews and the quality of my Athena sub, but when I got it home, I was disappointed. Design is nice and the unit has some punch and bass, but you pay for it in accuracy in the mids and highs. Vocals receded to the background and even sounded muffled compared to a much lower powered Tivoli iSongbook. The Songbook has less power, but I'll take it for it's true mids and highs.All these machines are basically a boombox with a dock. I should be able to get decent sound for $100, shouldn't I?Vann's was good about taking it back."
5,ATHENA iVOICE ROCKS!,"Buying the Athena iVoice for my 80G ipod Classic was the best $70.00 I've ever spent! My brother has a Bose radio, and I can't tell the difference (except for the price!). I have to admit that I was skeptical when I read everyone's reviews, but for the price difference, I decided that it was worth the risk. The clarity and volume are amazing! Now I listen to music more than I watch TV! I highly recommend the iVoice as a cheaper alternative to the Bose. You won't be sorry about the cash you save!"
1,Product was defective,"I received my speakers and really enjoyed them until the unit started turning the volume up to MAXIMUM every time I turned it on. Quite embarassing considering I had it in my office! It was so loud it hurt my ears to get near it to turn it off. I called the manufacturer and they admitted some of these are defective and they've been having complaints. So if you get a decent unit, great - but there's a chance it will be a hassle as mine was. I didn't get a replacement based on the reviews I read online of several people having my same experience."
2,"Good sound, BUT starts at max volume when you turn it on","It has good sound (which is why I didn't give it one star) but it starts at max volume every time you turn it on. This is very annoying, but I've figure out how to deal with it. I just start it on a quite song, hold it facing the floor and begin lowering the volume immediately. Not worth the money for that inconvenience and I will never buy from them again."
4,not too bad for such a little system,"This actually has decent sound, and the bass is good, especially for the size. Of course it doesn't compare to all the big speakers out there! Set up was extrememly easy, and the remote works well. Basically you just plug it in and go. Definitely a good one!"
3,It will work when he's a little bigger,"I'm sure it will work fine when he's a little bigger but right now it's a tad too loose. I haven't tried it in a shopping cart, it may work better there."
3,kinda close to what I wanted,I bought this as a baby gift. Unfortunately the baby died before he was old enough to use it. I had something similar back when my kids were little and I used it a LOT! It was so handy to take with me in the diaper bag and be able to secure my baby into any chair and not have to haul the whole car seat from the car. The one I had included a bottom piece that the baby sat on that kept it in place. I wish I could find one like that again.
5,Fits in purse,I find this to be one of the most helpful items I have. I did the big shopping cart cover but my baby was happy to lean forward to bite on the bars or lean to the side. I also felt a little conspicuous putting the big kind on a shopping cart and dealing with the baby at the same time. This strap has fixed both those issues. I keep it in my big purse. I walk in the store and place the baby in the cart. I can then quickly remove from my purse and have my baby strapped in before the next person comes for a cart. I seem so much smoother as a mom now. It also helps keep my little girl sitting straight up and not leaning forward or the side. She does not mind it at all. At the end when dealing with the groceries and the baby I simply pull it off and slip it into my purse. People stop me while shopping to comment on it. Yes my baby can put her hands on the germy areas of the cart but at least now she can't put her mouth on anything.
5,The Best!,No Grandma should be without one of these! My daughter scoffed at it but now agrees it's the best; it keeps my grandson in the old high chair without any worry of falling. Highly recommend!
4,Great for securing toddlers,"I have twin boys and find that very few shopping trolleys have straps which are not torn, broken or missing. These velcro straps are easy and efficient. They are broad, so do not cut into the boys when they are in the seat; the velcro is strong, so they do not pull off easily; and they are long, which also makes them more secure. I am really pleased I bought them."
4,cool idea,I got this for my daughter and we've had it about 7 months. She's 11 months now and finally can use it without putting a pillow behind her. But it's very nice and we'll be able to use it for our next baby.
5,Works great,"Love this thing. Yeah, it's cheaply made but it functions well and has so far held up. So much easier than fiddling with those straps already on the carts and keeps the kiddo secure and somewhat restrained."
4,"Generic lyrics, but amazing hardcore riffage.","I'm sure you've heard it all before. ""my best friend stabbed be in the back but i still have the undying support of my family and my hardcore crew to back me up,"" and more typos in the lyric sheet than anyone would like to mention, but all of that is kept down to a dull roar, because musically, Straight Faced pull off the feverishly paced chugga-chugga moshcore with enthusiasm left over to fill buckets. Next time run spell check and have your singer write better lyrics, and you could have album of the year. By the way, the production on this album is incredible. Massive guitar crunch, and a bass sound to die for. Snare drums that leap out of the mix during the slow bits, while the guitars dominate on the fast numbers, all while sounding consistent. If I ever wind up in a hardcore band, i'm getting the guy who did this album into the studio with me."
2,"A little girl, a witch named Murgatroyd and a cat named Hornsbydale","A little girl discovers a witch and her cat living in the garden shrubbery. Judy enjoys Murgatroyd's spells, but is vexed by her bad temper, rudeness and often nasty behavior. A dragon, Chinquintafizz or Fizz, is brought to life from a painted tray and teaches Judy magic, which comes in handy when a Halloween gathering of witches becomes dangerous."
3,Growing more plants,i was hoping for more creative ways to grow things. i like to experiment and thought this would spur more creativity. it's a good basic book
1,Not For Dummies,This text should not be purchased by someone who has never done any plant propagation before. It is too general in its explanations and very vague as to specific plant propagation. Wish I hadn't purchased this book.
2,Nice idea. Bad material.,"Most people did not know what 127.0.0.1 meant ;-) I had fun explaining it :-)But the cotton material is too thick and rough for my taste. If I had had a chance to feel it before buying it, I would not have bought it :-("
3,Of moderate interest,I didn't read anything revealing or terribly funny in this book. I suppose it lends some balance to the dramatic tales -- like COmpany Commander -- and therefore exemplifies the boredom that fills so much of warfare and preparing for warfare.I would have to say that there are fairly good reasons why it remained unpublished for so many years. It's simply not very interesting.
4,"A joy to read Stalin's favorite book, a hero and his reward","I found the story interesting and flowing. Fantastic in it's own way and brings one to a sense of another world. I read only the English translation, so what was lost, I cannot say."
2,"Obvious scholarship, but not for the non-theologian","I'll open with the caveat that it is clear that this book is prime intellectual material; however, if you don't know the whos, wheres, and why nots of Christianity and Judaism, including the complete biblical vocabulary, then this might not be the book for you. I purchased The Jesus Legend hoping to learn an objective lesson about the life and times of Jesus and the creation of the church. Unfortunately for me, and I would assume anyone without a substantial grounding in theology and the history of Christianity, it quickly becomes obscure. Don't try to read it on an airplane without a dictionary, for example. Furthermore, the author spends a great deal of time defending his earlier works and counter attacking his critics, so it isn't a good first entry into an understanding of the historical Jesus. I would appreciate any emailed suggestions from other interested secular surfers on what that book might be."
1,Worked for 5 minutes then died,Sadly because I was only able to use this product 3 months after I bought it I wasno longer able to give it back. I was only able to get 5 minutes of use out of it before it stopped working
1,worked ... but not for long!,"Having just arrived in the US I wanted to get my UK Xbox to work asap. Great I thought, this would do the trick. Plugged it in and worked a treat. Then after about an hour it stopped working. I tried something else in the plug and that didn't work. The plug itself felt like it was hotter than the sun and on touching it really felt like it burnt me. I've ordered a replacement just to see if the original unit was faulty!"
1,BROKEN ON DELIVERY,My product was broken when it arrived. I will let the company know and keep you informed with their reply.
1,bad,Used this to plug my PlayStation into. The thing just overheated and. Blew out within a few seconds doesn't make sense. Out put is 230 PlayStation uses. . . 230.
2,Did not work - so had to return,I was not happy with the product as it was faulty.Unfortunately I had to return it and there were no hassles in the return.I probably got a bad piece but would not recommend not buying this item.
3,Eh...,"The recordings of the Mozart violin concertos are okay. These performances aren't amazing, butthey aren't really bad either. It's just an average recording that I found enjoyable for background music. If I had to do it again, I probably would have purchased another recording of the Mozart Violin concertos."
4,For your extended listening pleasure,"I bought this mainly because of the extended versions of the songs from The Golden Age Of Wireless album, which is my favorite by Thomas Dolby.I especially like the harmonizing vocals in Europa And The Pirate Twins...one of my all time favorite songs. This is actually the first version of the song I ever heard years ago.Windpower is a great dance song.Flying North also features an ambient break preceding an arpeggio(?) style synth solo.After listening to these extended versions you may not want to go back to listening to the shorter ones.The Flat Earth songs aren't bad, just not quite as interesting as the Golden Age Of Wireless songs. Dissidents and Hyperactive are both enjoyable.For me the rest of the cd at best is ok.I really don't care for Dolby's later work but I gave the cd 4 stars for the brilliant versions from The Golden Age Of Wireless."
4,"great 12"" compillation!","Just a great compillation of extended, remixed & short versions of the most known songs of TD. a perfect complement for any personal discography. 80's music followers listen to the samples."
2,Not Quite There,"Hey, I am a fan. Drove 200 miles to see him live in small intimate loose and college type environments last year and this mix-mix is really not so ""Dolby"". Is more early 80's dj mixes. Lot's of congas style, remember ""conga"" type, so not really up to his ""inventive exotic style"". Outdated even then. So, get the real thinga.... Get it???"
3,Europa part 2,I was wondering if anyone has heard or knows were to get europa part 2. I first heard it on mtv late at night it's a version that has a constant beat then the original and ive heard the 12 inch and its not the 12 inch the other time i heard it was at a club and the dj showed me the record and it said europa part 2 thomas dolby if anyone knows of this rare song please let me know... thank you
4,Although he didn't catch on fire....he's still a nice change of pace..,"Thomas Dolby like Gary Neuman (Cars) and Scritty Politti (Absolute), will always be remembered as one hit wonders, Thomas serves us with his production stylee with 12X12...it's actually better than those greatest hits collections that have been put together featuring his music....all this one needs are the original copies of 'Airhead"", ""Hot Sauce"", ""The Aliens ate my Buick"" and throw in ""I love you good-bye"" and ""Silk Pajamas""...and the collaberation ""Some of my best Jokes are friends"" with George Clinton and it would be complete..."
2,Good Product? Latches Are Dangerously Sharp!,"Geez, I must have different thoughts and ideas from most others on what a well designed product is. Forget about the price. I wouldn't buy such a product where the two metal latches to open the lid are so sharp that you could cut your hand(s). Why would any reasonable thinking person want that? I'll pass. $20 or the overpriced $80 everyone is focused on here. If Stanley would just changes these latches to something less conducive to cutting oneself, I'd rate it a 5 star."
3,Only 12.25 Inches Wide At Bottom & Wrong Colors.,"So I bought this item to store several Stanley parts boxes that are 13 inches wide. Figured at 18.5 inches, this item would not be tapered so much to lose 5.5 inches on the inside width. Wrong... item has a very wide top and tapers too much use the interior as a stacking storage. I suppose this is meant to throw a bunch of loose tools and such inside without any organization. Also, the advertised and attractive yellow wheels and tray where not to be found on this item. Big on the outside, small on the inside. Only a review... otherwise... life is grand!"
1,Amazon's sky high retail price!!!,I found this storage box here on Amazon's site that's why I'm writing this review!!!The Home Depot sell's this exact item everyday for $49.99...Why should I pay $78 for it on amazon? And I also pay for the Prime shipping on Amazons site...I just don't get what there doing at all!!!Shame on them!!!
3,Entertaining history,I purchased this video thinking it would cover modern hardware but it was actually made in 1989 and showed nothing newer than that. It was a nice blast from the past though.
2,It is not about rockets.,"This DVD is not about rockets at all. Only missiles. So if you're interested in watching things get blown up, it's great. If you want to watch rocket launches, save your money."
2,Concerns about it,"It is a nice dish, but I read a report from government warning about pyrex dishes exploding in the oven. Something about company using a cheaper glass. I don't know if this one is involved. But I threw it away just to be on safe side..."
1,ITem shipped is not what is pictured,"Buyer Beware!!!!!!! Item shipped does not include both cutters as shown in photo! Only the larger cutter option is included, and product was not useable by me."
5,Great skillet!,This skillet is super! Lots of cooking room and the non-stick surface works like a dream. Since it is a rather large pan the extra carrying handle comes in very handy!
5,Cuisinart Chef's Classuc Non-stick Pan,"It's hard to rave about a frying pan, but this one is exactly what you'd want it to be. Nothing sticks to it, it's easy to clean, and it cooks evenly and perfectly every time. We use it mostly for omelets, and it satisfies us every time."
1,useless for induction,"The item listing says ""stainless steel"" but it is just crappy aluminum pot, not magnetic at all, totally useless for induction stove. Seems similar in quality to what you'd find hanging at a supermarket or small hardware store."
1,IT STICKS!!!,"I bought this skillet a couple of years ago. I love the shape and the stay-cool handle. But whenever try to make scrambled eggs in it (which is one of the main things I used it for) everything sticks to the bottom. The only way to get it out is to soak it in hot soapy water and then SCRAPE the new ""egg"" coating off. The skillet still looks great, but because of this problem I won't buy another."
1,UN-BALANCED,"Not having cooked in the skillet, I cannot comment on how it cooks ... only that the handle is too heavy and/or large for the little skillet. If I barely touched the handle when I had it on the cook top it would tilt. It looks to heavy and large for the little pan and IS, in my opinion. I have the Cuisinart 12"" skillet that I use lots of the time and love ... I think I will still try the 8 "" one and see if the balance is better.Still loving Cuisinart in GA"
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"We purchased one of these pans about 3 years ago. Cuisinart claimed you could use metal unensils with it so we did. After about a year the coating was badly scratched and food was sticking to it. We decided it was our fault and purchased another one.This time we never used metal with it and were very careful not to scratch it with anything. It lasted almost two years but now food is sticking to this one. No amount of cleaning helps either. The skillet still looks great but it is useless now. I've tried to contact customer service but they're not responding. Apparently their ""lifetime warranty"" is worthless.Next time I'll buy a cheap pan at half the price and forget this brand in the future. They're just not worth the money."
