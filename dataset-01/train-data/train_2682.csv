1,Bought it before I realized that some pictures were of aborted babies,"If aborted(murdered) babies do not bother you, purchase this book. I read that some of the pictures were of aborted babies but was not sure whether it were true. Did some research and confirmed that some of the babies were killed through abortion. Do not buy this book unless you wish to support the author's ethics."
2,Great pics before they were aborted,Yes it's true. Look it up. Those beautiful pictures of alive babies were taken just before they were aborted.
1,Warning: Way too graphic!,"I bought this for myself and for my sister-in-law as little ""pregnancy gifts.""I was extremely disappointed! The in utero photos are beautiful - BUT the content is EXTREMELY graphic - the entire section on delivery is filled with photos of fully naked women delivering their babies. It is Very possible to give birth while basically clothed (I wear 2 hospital gowns, so as to cover front & back). It was not necessary to include this kind of nudity.Additionally, the whole section that leads up to conception was also graphic & superfluous. I returned both books immediately!"
4,very good. jazz-style harmonies,I just finished listening to this on the radio... really excellent.sounds like classical music that a jazz pianist would write.
2,"Okay, but other books are out there.","Like I said in a precious review, I like National University, but they could have chosen a different book. I am Caucasian, white, Christian, heterosexual, male, with blonde hair and blue eyes, and let me tell you, this book will make it seem that the whit people in this country are racist bigots. And that we are trying to indoctrinate every single child that comes to America while keeping all the other people in lower classes. That is how I felt.I was shocked by how biased this book is. I am beginning to think that the publishers Allyn and Bacon have an agenda.One of the only topics I liked about this book is the short parts at the end of each chapter that tells the reader different ideas for making a professional portfolio. But, I can imagine that there are other books better."
3,Ok,I ordered this and got them and they we ok but I order some more and they were much better... Still good from the price.
1,Really low quality product,Two of the four boxes fell apart when I opened them. These are not fit for jewelry. I don't know why you'd bother to make something this low quality.
2,Not as described - for earrings and dirty,"These boxes arrived looking very dirty. They were able to be cleaned up, but still that shouldn't be needed. The inserts were also for earrings, not a necklace/pendant as described. Luckily that didn't affect us as the inserts were tossed out anyways (we needed something for bracelets in bags to be given as gifts)."
3,I like the design but could not flush it entirely against the bolt.,"I would rate this kit 5 stars if I could only flush the lock plates to some of the bolts. In order to do this I would have to overtighten or loosen the bolts. I think if the locking plate had more notches, I would not have this problem. More than half of the bolts had about an 1/16"" to 1/8"" gap from the locking plate or maybe that's how it was designed to be, don't know. At least I'll know if I need to retighten the bolts if these become flushed to the bolts."
4,"What a voice, what a talent","I was very excited to see this most recent compilation of Gary's work. I have never understood why more of his albums have not been released on CD. Anyway, this CD offers some perfect examples of why I consider John Gary to have one of the best voices in popular music. I particularly like I'll Remember Her. A song that I had never heard him sing before. Just listen to a few cuts of this CD and you will be hooked. He was one of the best.fan from Memphis,TN"
5,Good selection for a truly wonderful voice.,"I love to sit in front of a fireplace with my lady, sharing this wonderful music, along with a glass or three of fine wine.I am still waiting for them to release, ""John Gary at Carnege Hall"". I used to own it as an LP back in the 70's. I would still have it but it just wore out."
5,Perfect,"I wanted an inexpensive set of dip trays for sushi night, this are great for that, cost about 85 cents apiece, you can't beat that... They are very light weight, I would not put them in the dish washer. With hand washing I expect years of service from these."
1,Schuller at his best 'Realization'???,I took this conductor at his word after reading his book 'The Complete Conductor'. He CERTAINLY does not practice what he preaches with the what is in my opinion the pinnicle of 20th Century Music. Errors of 'interpretation' using his own methdolgy appear from the start to the finish. NOT a good recording of 'The Rite of Spring' for man nor beast. Goes to show he was 'talkin' the talk' in his book but can't 'Walk the Walk'!
5,Biggest Memories,"I have just finished listening to this Cd and I don't even know where to begin. This CD brings back all the memories of being a teenager. I will admit, there were just a few songs that I didn't know, but the rest of them were great. This is the kind of Cd that brings back so many memories, practically one for each song. The song ""Poison Ivy"" is a classic itself. I like ""Boom, I Got Your Girlfriend"" and ""I Seen Your Boyfriend"". I also really enjoy ""Shake it Baby"" and ""Bump Ya Rump"". Hearing ""B-Girls"" took me back to the rollarskating days. ""Gimme a Bottle"" made me remember all the fun times with my friends. ""It's My Cadillac"" made me think of when I used to sit right next to the loud speakers to hear the true bass. This CD is definitely the one for memories. If you want to just think about the good old days, I really reccommend Biggest Bass Hits From The Bottom"" for anyone who wants to have some fun."
2,One feature of this CD was undesirable.,"The musical quality was good. I have this exact production on vinyl and could have made a CD here but decided to take advantage of this having been done for me already. One feature (on most CDs) is the ability to skip ahead for different segments of the piece or different numbers.On this CD, the presentation was segmented but in a very coarse, amateurish manner. You could see where the number had just been poorly clipped between segments. Very badly done."
5,I can't believe it's out of print!,"I just finished reading Dead Ned (and Live and Kicking Ned) last month. I enjoyed these books far more than any of the recently published novels I read this summer, and I find it unfortunate that publishers, and readers, would let such a treasure go out of print. Shame on us."
3,"Large fit my 40 lbs Boxer, albeit a little snugly in places","I ordered the large. It fit my 40lbs Boxer puppy, but was a little snug in the front armpits, and around the head. He wouldn't keep the head on because it was too tight. The armpits were also a little movement restricting for the little guy, but since it was only on for a short while, it wasn't too bad.I'm doubtful the large we bought this year will fit him next year."
2,Not sized right,"I ordered a large for my boxer mix. I even took the measuring tape to my dog to insure that it would fit him. I got it and the legs barely fit, the velcro wouldn't reach to fasten and I couldn't even attempt to get the hood on."
5,Great straight ahead jazz with a fine cast.,"This is a fine CD led by New York guitarist Michael Bocian playing electric guitar.The CD offers fine soloing by a strong cast comprised of Fred Hersch, Ed Shuller and Rashid Ali. The CD contains a number of Bocian's interesting uptempo compositions as well as a few ballads. Of the eleven titles on the album, nine are original compositions by Bocian. Ornette Coleman's Law Years provides an exciting vehicle for Schuller and Bocian to display their unique form of comminication.A quality CD."
5,I like it more very time. Cory Ryan is great.,"Just got it and instantly added it to my favorites. These songs are catchy. It's a clean, vibrant, sound - very creative. It's packed with energy, well done."
2,Disappointing,"I was stunned to read that the author thought that $120 a week for groceries for a family of four was frugal! Amy Dacyzyn (of the Tightwad Gazette) only spends this amount for an entire month of meals for her family of 8!I have a family of 5, and I rarely spend more than $80! Other than that, I didn't find the recipes all that inspiring. This one will probably end up in the Friends of the Library book sale."
5,Great gift for someone new in the kitchen,"My niece decided she wanted to take on some of the household duties, like shopping and cooking. (I think she actually wanted more control over what was served for dinner.) Not having done much beyond boiling pasta, this was quite a challenge. This book was a great jumping off point for her and she still refers back to it. The cupboard and marketing tips taught her that a shopping list isn't just the things you ran out of this week. She is becoming a good menu planner without breaking her mother's budget."
1,"Very old, same scenes all the time, not good at all","The video isnt updated, is very old, they just took some shots, but is pretty much the same scenes all the time, the quality isn;t good enough"
4,Converted to a self-circulating waterer - Awesome!,"I've had one of these for my golden retriever for YEARS. It got to where he could, if he so decided, bump the top off to access the food, so I wasn't keeping food in it anymore. Recently I got the idea of converting it to a large capacity self-circulating waterer, and for that it is AWESOME. Drilled a coupe of holes, added a pump and some tubing, and it works perfectly. It's at a good height for both my dogs, and my cats like to jump up on it and drink from it too."
3,It's OK,I was hoping it would be easier to take the top off and put back on to access the dog food. You have to line up 2 ridges in the top to put the lid back on and they don't seat straight everytime so it's not exactly effortless. It's OK
4,born a master,"This is a very good story about Sifu Lin's life. It is very short on technique. If you want to understand how the master things, this is great. If you want technique, you want Mantak Chia, or maybeArt of Chi Kung,Amazing Secrets of Psychic Healing,Seventh Sense Imaginal Healing: An homage to Dr. Richard Bartlett, Benjamin Bibb, Barbara Ann Brennan, Donna Eden, Dr. Meg Blackburn Losey, Dr. Gerald ... Carl Simonton, Thomas Willhite, and others.orHealing Visualizations: Creating Health Through Imagery. This guy's stuff is interesting, and he is clearly a sifu for the modern age."
5,Great Book,Very inspiring story. Makes you think about how you may be able to heal yourself. This book is for anyone interested in Tai Chi.
5,LOTS OF GREAT INFORMATION,"THIS BOOK IS CHUCKED FULL OF GREAT INFORMATION, DOES TAKE AWHILE TO COMPREHEND THOUGH. SLOW READ BUT A VERY INFORMATIVE READ."
1,No content at all.,"I am furious with this book. It's 300 pages of advertisement you have to pay for.What it says is this: ""Hey, the Quigong exercises by Chunyi Lin will heal the planet, but you'll have to buy our $250 self-study course to learn it.""There are two exercises included in this ""book"", half-assedly explained. The rest is Chunyi's story and page after page of testimonials (yes - TESTIMONIALS! Like the cheesy ones on those webpages where people are desperately trying to sell you things).Ye Gads! Why did I buy it?Bottom line: If you really want to learn this system, don't waste your money on this book - rather, get the self-study course from learningstrategies.com or attend one of his classes."
2,Born a Healer,"The book does a great sales job for the man's technique but when you actually do the exercises he gives to you, they are silly."
4,an inspiring read,"a wonderful book to read any time, but especially when you are searching for answers to why you hurt and how you can help yourself and your family not hurt anymore. I love the idea that WE have the power to heal ourselves (some would say miraculously). We DO NOT have to feel dependant upon the ""Gods"" of medicine and pharmacies in order receive a false ""cure"" Heal yourself...for good! Read this book then make a way to go to one of his classes. It will change your life."
3,not exactly what I expected,"While interesting as far as Mr. Lin's history and how he came to master his subject, there were only a few brief pages of technique and then lots of testimonials. I want MORE technique and less sales pitch. It felt, to me, like one long advertisement vs. a practical way to learn and apply those teachings."
5,WW1 A Soldier's Memoir of WW1,"I felt like I was there too at times, though I wasn't even born yet. I also know more about where my own grandfather was after being wounded. Fact are really coming out. Need to know the truth, read this book!"
3,Good pan for the money,"Considering the cost of this pan, it does the job just fine. If the material was a bit thicker or sturdier, I'd like it better....but I feel I got my moneys worth."
2,nonstick? ya right.,"makes a nicely shaped omlet but ""non stick""...ya not so much. its rarely used and i need cooking psray and loads of it every time."
1,omelet pan,pan arrived unaslembled with no instructions for aslemby or use. coating began to peel off after fourth use with no implements ever touching the surface of the pan.
1,not worth it,not worth the money.This pan burnt up on the second use on medium heat. All the coating pealed off.Just threw it away like my money spent on this pan.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
1,omelet pan,"This omelet pan started to peel right away. I am very displeased with it. I cannot return it because the return time has apparently expired. I think Amazon should remove the item from its inventory. I would like a reply to this complaint, please.amazon should remove the item from"
2,You get what you pay for,"The very first time we used it some of the non-stick coating came off while making omlets. We even used cooking oil. We should have gotten one with a better coating, but there is no way to tell from their description. Handle needs to be tighten every so often too."
1,Did not care for,"I did not care for this item and unfortunately I bought two. I tried it on electric and gas, it worked better on gas, however it was very awkward to cook with as it took forever to get the entire egg cooked. The middles got burnt and I even had to flip the egg in each side of the pan before I could load the center just to get it cooked through. I have a much easier time making an omelet in a normal 10 inch frying pan and I threw these in the trash."
1,"flimsy metal, too light","It is too light gage metal, cooks un evenly...I have to be over the sink to flip it over, cause it always leaks"
1,I should have read the reviews more closely.,"This pan makes the biggest mess I have ever had. It drips oil on my class-top stove and leaks the egg mixture when turned. Save your money. BTW, I rarely write reviews, however this one was warranted!"
2,looks good but....,Very disappointed with this item. The cover does not fit tight and therefore it leaks all over the burner when I turn my omelet over to cook on the other side! I have gone back to using my old one. Sorry.
3,Omelet Pan,"The actual pan itself is everything that I wanted in an Omelet maker! Omelets come out nice and easy, the bad part I dislike about it is the plastic handles. I think they could or should be shrouded by some sort of metal covering so they do not get burnt or mel;ted on top of a gas burner stove which mine have bubbled up a bit. They may be best on an electric range. The performance of the pan is excelelent."
5,omelete pan,very well thought out idea saves a lot of time turning the Omelete and putting the fillings in and very good value for the money.
1,Junk!,"Followed seasoning directions, and on the FIRST omelet the coating began to come off.Had a Mirro pan for many years that finally quit on us, but even then I think it was better than this crap. Don't buy it! Will see if we can get the $$$ back. Not much cost, and not worth anything."
3,Wobbly,"Functional, but handle will not stay tightened. Thirteen more words are required before I can submit this review. Sorry for wasting your time, but I have nothing more meaningful to say."
2,You pay for what you get,Not horrible but the metal is so thin when you bring it up to omlett temp it crates a Burn spot on the pan. You pay for what you get so can't say I'm surprised but can't recommend it if you really plan to use it.
3,Omelet Pan,The pan will not fit on the entire burner. Therefore one side cooks faster than the other than the other.
2,had to throw it away,Terrible. Don't waste your money on this pan. There must be something better out there. There isn't much more to say.
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","This is a nice wind speed indicator and it has a gust meter to capture the highest gust. The scale only goes up to 100 miles per hour. It is well made. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
4,Good,"I liked this game very much, I've always wanted to run my own airline, the only thing that dissatisfied me were the graphics, bad graphics."
1,A waste of money,"I should have heeded the reviews. This game is too ""kiddy"" like that is difficult to learn, hard to interface and shallow. The graphics are awful unless your child. Buyer beware."
3,DINAH DESERVES MORE,"This is certainly not the best overview of DINAH SHORE.While you get some hits,some of the songs(YES MY DARLING DAUGHTER,PERSONALITY)show their age and could have been easily subsitued by other songs far better that the singer recorded.It would be sad if your judgement of her should rely only with this quick package release because RCA is 100 years old.DINAH deserves better;she was a wonderful tv show hostess,full of charm and wit.I am old enough to remember the last years she had a show,and it was fun to hear beautiful songs of the repertoire sung by her.There are better collection like the RCA-COLUMBIA package,A PORTRAIT OF DINAH SHORE etc.You should find them easily;you just have to choose."
5,AMAZING TUNER,"This tuner is the best tuner i had ever use. I am doing a duet with my saxophone and its important for the two saxophone to be in tune or you can get marked down for it. I trust that this tuner can get us in tune and I use it for my guitar and I pass it around in band class a lot. Its a really nice tool to have. Its a Must get. O yeah, and the tuner only hears the instrument its tuning really nice feature!"
4,Chevy Bowtie Universal-Fit Seat Cushion,Bought this to replace a Chevy branded cloth cover that fell apart in just a couple of months. Poor design and quality.This seat cushion has a good look and feel. I've only had it for a couple of weeks but it appears to be much better choice than the cloth cover.
3,Chevy Cushion,"This item would be a good addition to my Chevy, but its looks are decieving. It looks nice, but doesnt attach well to the seat. It probably attaches better for mine because mine are fabric seats. But I don't think its worth buying two."
2,Not Happy,"I have a Chevy HHR and am trying to customize my car. This product comes single which I didn't know. It has one elastic strap that goes around the headrest, I guess no instructions. But getting in and out the seat moves constantly and always have to be re-adjusted. It is annoying to say the least. It needs another strap lower and it would hold better. The look is great if it stayed in place. Once the company adds another strap I will order another for the front seat passenger side."
4,Great Value,"These actually fit my Tahoe front seats. I wish they could have been a little higher so the chevy log could be close to the head rest. overall, they cover my seats well and the cushion is not as bad."
3,Good; more like a TV show than a movie,"I love forensics and this is a good video. It is more like watching a TV documentary, which it probably was originally, than a movie. I was a little taken aback, since I generally expect a video to be more or less the duration of a full-length movie, and this video was over before I was quite ready. Other than that, it was well done and I enjoyed it."
4,jigsaw puzzle,"If you want a real challenge, thought it looked sort of easy, sky, rocks, door, Jesus, but it has turned out to be pretty tough!! For the expert puzzler. You do know that an expert is simply a drip under pressure, right? :)"
1,Does not work on 1994 2.2L Camry,It simply does not work on my 1994 2.2L Camry. The pliers are too small to go around the lobe and then compress the lifter. The description should be clear on what models are supported.
4,"Good tool, great price","This tool did exactly what I needed it to do. I used it on a 1.6 litre, 4A-FE engine. If it was designed somewhat differently, specifically if it could reach around a bigger diameter cam shaft, it might have a more universal application and may even have made this job easier. The depressing tool seems to be very sturdily made. The holding tool is very thin and - I think - could easily have been stamped from thicker material, but it didn't bend out of shape during my brief use. This could become an issue if the tool was to be used frequently. For my use, I was completely satisfied."
1,No Help,"I was not able to get this tool to work satisfactorily on my 2000 Toyota 5S-FE Engine. Inadequate room and working angles. Maybe it is just this engine. 3 of the exhaust valves were the only valves that required adjustment and that is the cam shaft that is the easiest to remove. My local Toyota Dealer allowed me to go through their box of used disks to find the thickness I needed and didn't even charge me. The Timing belt will be due for replacement at 90,000 miles and I'll remove both Cams if necessary to adjust intake and/or exhaust valves at that time. Everything is back together and working great."
5,Too Cute!,This locket was great - it was blank so I could get it engraved with my sister's childrens' initials. Perfect! She loved it.
1,Very Dissapointed,"I was very dissapointed in this locket which I purchased as a gift for my best friend who was leaving to go to China for a year. I recieved it in the mail and found that is was very cheaply made. It is not of good quality and is VERY LIGHT in weight. I thought something made of silver would be more substantial in weight but this locket is NOT. Also, it is very plain. I realize the style of this piece is simple but when I looked at it first hand it didn't even look well made. The clasp is not even a clasp that jewler's use. It is one that you can pry apart and is not welded together. Over all I was very dissapointed and would never give it as a gift to anyone. I returned it immediately."
5,The Queen of Marimba Reigns Supreme,"NAncy Zeltsman deserves the title of Queen of Marimba. She pulls emotion from the instrument like water flowing through a stream. Her technique is amazing and her sound is sweet and gentle, but harsh when needed. This album is by far one of the best marimba albums ever recorded. Her arrangement of Susan Vega's Gypsy is worth the price of the CD alone. NO ONE SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS RECORDING."
3,Enjoyable dance band music of the late 20's and early 30's,"Ambrose was one of the top bands overseas in the late 20's and eary 30's, in fact British dance bands durung that era were hotter then most American dance bands like Paul Whiteman, and Guy Lombardo which played mostly ""sweet"" music. This CD is recommended for those who like the 20's/30's society dance band sound. If you like the 20's/30's dance band sound sweet or hot you should go see live The Crazy Rhythm Hot Society Orchestra which often plays at Dixieland festivals, they recreate the sound of the 20's dancebands and they even have a flapper singer Kelley Foster, check them out at crazyrhythm.com to find out where they perform."
3,Not worth the price,"This book gives a general overview of the British army WWI uniforms and equipment. However, the coverage and depth is patchy and leaves a lot unanswered. The colour illustrations are not great and overall, it is not worth the asking price. Other similar and cheaper books by Osprey would be a better bet for your money."
3,Handy Gadget at least,"Handy space-saver, though I have to wonder how long the carousel tray will last. Pretty flimsy."
2,OK - would not buy again,These are a little cheaper quality than I expected - they loose shape when you reheat food in the microwave. I'm actually just using the containers now and throwing them away when I'm finished. Better off going with the tupperware you can just buy at the grocery store to reuse. These are good if you are using them one time or giving food away as gifts maybe.
2,Kinda cheap and a bit small!,"I love the idea of this set, I am an organizational freak so this should have been perfect! But unfortunately this does fall under the ""you get what you pay for."" The set is very cheap and also much smaller than I thought it would be! Spend the extra $ and get something more durable."
5,Prime Pacific Trading 49-Piece Food Storage Container Set,This is definitely worth having. I have such little space and anything easier to use and contains things is perfect. The cost was far less than other retailers wanted..
3,Good enough,strange shapes and some of the lids do not have lips.... next time I will invest more money and go elsewhere
1,Great concept. Worst execution I've ever seen! Stay away!!,The idea was great. It was the worst quality and the worst material ever. I wish I could rate this zero stars.
1,Not euro-trance (read the review),"I hate euro-trance and this is not much better. It represents all that is bad about the commercialisation of dance music. It is, unarguably, music written to pay execs wages. The shame of it is that this is the kind of music us Brits are exporting across the pond and getting known for. Maybe it will turn people onto the better apsects of British dance but, unfortunately it will probably be the first in a long line of cash-ins.Listen to Underworld, Orbital, FC Kahuna instead, not this low-rent Moby cash-in."
2,Not exactly original,"I guess I bought into the commercialism of music not feeling completely confident with the purchase I made. The beats have a hollowness to them not as intricate or as robust as its genera's counterparts. Its really not very good. To pop to be trance too trance to be pop. So if you like this genera, look elsewhere for a better rep of it or save your cash and borrow the album from a friend. You'll forget it 10 minutes later anyhow."
2,Disappointing,"I must admit I was excited to finally figure out who the people were behind the music in the great car commercial. ""Days go by"" is just one of those songs you have to listen to cruising down the freeway. The rest of the songs, are no way as good in comparison. I find myself constantly hitting the scan button, searching for a potentially good song, always winding back to ""days go by"". If like ""days go by"" buy the single, don't waste your money buying the whole album. If you think the album has potential, burn it off someone else who mistakeningly bought it too."
3,house-pop...,"I bought this album based on all the talk about it and I was quite dissapointed. Though it is not a bad album I am an avid electronica listener and this music doesn't exactly appeal to me...Its mostly house music with vocals & also some pop integrated in most songs, and there are so many better house cdz out there! Oh by the way Karen from New York...its TECHNO...not TEKNO, and no it is not NEARLY as good as Moby. And please don't compare this music to rap!!! its like comparing punk to classical music!"
2,Hated it. Hated it. Hated it.,"One or perhaps two quite good tunes. Then ... I must endure. This is one of those CDs that I feel resentful after buying.The vocals are weak. There is little range (as in, variation) in the tunes, which might be ok if what wasn't being varied was really clever, but really clever this album is not. Totally not.I know a bunch of you young whippersnappers will get a kick out of the rework of ""Another Brick in the Wall"" but, you know, there are *three* different versions of that song on The Wall, which are all good, and Dirty Vegas's rework of that tune (one of Pink Floyd's most accessible and bitter excursions into nihilism) is just plain offensive to me. It is unoriginal, it has no flair, it has no zip, it has no edge. I hate it. Hate it, hate it, hate it.Well there you have it."
4,Good Start To A Promising New Band,"Yes, by now everyone knows of ""Days Go By"" the catchy electronic song from the Mitsubishi commercial. So if you know that song and like it, you know what you're in for with Dirty Vegas. However, maybe you don't. When I first listened to the album, I was struck by how many folk/pop like techno songs there were. And I liked it. There are only two instrumentals. There's a calm almost trance-like feeling to the music and male vocals which makes Dirty Vegas a nice and refreshing addition to the pop realm. I like that the vocals and music actually compliment each other and the song writing isn't bad either. I actually enjoy songs like ""Alive"", ""Ghosts"" and ""Simple Things"" more than ""Days Go By"". A good start to a promising new band."
5,THIS CD IS HOT!!!,"No one-hit-wonder in my book. These guys remind me of early REM (you remember, when they were tapped into what audiences were craving - meaningful lyrics with a tight new sound)."
4,MITSUBISHI,I was told that dirty vegas does the mitsubishi commercial .If so please inform me of the track number .Thanks for your effort Bob Morse
3,Catchy ...,"Dirty Vegas manages to produce some decent beats and listenable harmonies, but their lyrics seem to be written by someone with a tenuous grasp on the English language. A line from the first track that goes ""Waking up in someone's attic/Find it's all on automatic/Look out boy it's problematic"" is a good example of the apparent intellectual blockade behind their lyrical shortcomings. Manging to rhyme ""attic"" with ""-atic"" and that extra special second ""-atic"" is indicative of the wordsmithing to be found throughout. Still it's certainly not the worst dance album out there right now. Close examination might reveal that it the album is uninspired enough to give a lower rating, but it's hard to be too down on something this harmless."
1,Not that great of An Album,"Misleading album, Indie rock songs put me to sleep, dance beats on other tracks were good but not oustanding, Days gone by is the best track on the album. I have to skip many times throughout the album. The innovative tracks are good, but yet still not amazing or inspiring. Not up to par with Albums by Groove Armada, Basement Jazz or other trance and house artists. Bottom of the barrel CD that will get lost in my collection of many."
3,Mitsubishi made them famous and found their only great track,"OK - so my title is a little harsh. The all too famous Mitsubishi ad featuring their track ""Days Go By"" has put them on the map. The problem is that people looking for more of this great type of music will be dissapointed to find this CD lacking any other really ""clubbable"" (is that a word?) tracks. The rest of the CD may not be that bad but not up to my liking. It's a bit soft around the edges if you know what I'm saying."
4,"Good music, good lyrics","This doesn't quite strike me as ""dance music"", but then I'm not one to go dancing. I agree the music is danceable, but I like the songs on this album for the lyrics. Nice, simple lyrics which have some story or feeling behind them. For instance, they redo their ""commercial song"" (heh) as a mostly acoustic number, and the song works fine that way because the lyrics are worth listening to.I also wanted to say that I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd, and I thought Dirty Vegas did a good job with the song where they included ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2""."
3,"OK CD, But There is Better!","This CD is good but I know of one that is better listening, Quentin's Ladder ""Delusion"". If you like electronica, you must check this one out."
2,Dirty Vegas - Dirty Vegas,"There's no denying that ""Days Go By"" is a killer song. It's got that driving bassline, those vocoded vocals, and the beat that just won't stop. It's the reason why that Mitsubishi car commercial has rightly become famous. Unfortunately the rest DIRTY VEGAS don't come close to matching that track's intensity. Instead, most of the songs scream ""I want to be a crossover hit,"" but without making that necessary leap. They deliver an alt rock/techno hybrid that really doesn't do justice to either. Compare, for example, the acoustic version of ""Days Go By"" to the regular version. See what I mean? Hopefully they'll be able to get their bearing and produce more stellar tracks, because one good song just can't save the whole album."
5,"Great CD, loved all of it","This CD is great. Not only is the song from the Mitsubishi commercial good, but so are all the others. Most of the tracks on this album are upbeat, get up and dance songs, but there are also some tracks that are mellow and relaxing. These guys have a different sound in every song. I can listen to every one without hitting the skip button. The arrangement of different sounds and rhythm is amazing. They kind of make me think of Pink Floyd mixed with techno. I hope to see Dirty Vegas around along time. If you liked the song in the commercial and enjoy upbeat music, you will love these guys."
3,Dirty Vegas Is Great! But Quentin's Ladder is Sicker!,"I love this Dirty Vegas CD, but I think that the Quentin's Ladder CD ""Delusion"" is a better dance album. It's more intense and has more energy."
4,"Oh right, from the car commercial..","..But I like this CD, some of the tracks are actually very good. It is not some irritating club/dance CD, a good mix of tunes. The last track features a more acoustic version of the song from that annoying car commercial (the one with the goofball dancing in the car like she got a bad dose of MDMA) which is surprisingly good."
4,Dirty vegas is not Dirty,Overall a pretty good album by any standard. The tracks Simple Things and Ghosts are classics in my mind. Throwing in a acoustic version of Days Go By didn't hurt either. While this record isn't the best record i've ever listened to it's worth the money.
2,Disappointing,"""Days Go By"" intrigued me, but I recommend listening to Everything But The Girl's ""Temperamental"" and Madonna's ""Ray of Light"" to hear everything this album wants to be. This is just a re-hash of things done much better elsewhere."
5,James Rollins proves he is once again at the top of his game,"With Black Order, Rollins once again proves that he has a force to be reckoned with in Sigma. Black Order follows two members of Sigma to the from the frozen mountain tops to the southern part of Africa, and just about everywhere in between.Rollins wonderful descriptions of the different locals take you to each one. The story builds on the characters we have met before and we learn more about each one.This is a great novel by James Rollins and I don't know how he can get any better!"
2,Book was missing page....,"While the book arrived on time, when I pulled it off the shelf to begin reading, there were pages missing both front and back. Loving James Rollins led me to hunt out another copy to be able to complete the story.Beware of sellers that don't examine books enough to make an honest sale."
1,How can a book be that bad?,"I guess I never read a book that bad. Simply unbelievable plot, forced action, far fetched and impossible style. Even on a long haul flight I wouldn`t recommend it. Don`t bother people, it`s just a waste of time. If possible I would give it zero stars."
1,PRETTY SCHLOCKY ...,"This sounded like fun but the book's execution has a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, it kind of reminded me of those late night movies on cable. Black Order throws together some interesting elements, though not necessarily fresh ones: Nazis, special forces teams, even Darwin's bible, whatever that's supposed to be mean. But the plot - if you could call it a plot - just doesn't work. It's like these elements were sort of thrown together but then they didn't really gel. I could have used a story, more reasoning, and better characters. This just doesn't work."
1,"Ruins, a ruin",Dialogue is simple minded and mostly irrelevent. It drags over those places. The action is spooky enough and I wanted to finish it to see how it ended but I didn't enjoy it as a whole. After I was finished I felt like I wished my mind could vomit to get rid of the toxins stirred up by the novel.
2,Sad Attempt to Duplicate Cussler,"Right out of the Cussler manual minus the style. Change the names of the characters (Dirk Pitt, etc.) and you have a Clive Cussler opus without the charm and wit. While this thriller holds one's attention, it's pretty silly and flat and you may wonder why the heck you're reading this thing as you plow through it. The characters are cardboard and not very likeable, the attempts at humor are lame, and the writing is downright awkward. Nice try."
3,Charles Darwin Bible??,"this was informative from a historical standpoint, but a little ""out there"", even for Rollins. the various subject lines were widely scattered and i didnt feel like they ever really tied together for a finished product. entertaining, but not his best."
3,Disapointing,I really enjoy James Rollins but this book got lost in details and kept repeating them over and over. Black Order started off strong and then just fizzeled out half way through and you knew how it would end. To predictable.
4,My 2nd of the Sigma Series,"Like other James Rollins books I have read, this one is also quite a ride. Kick your imagination in high gear. Some of it is a bit far fetched, but still fun to read. I very much like the mixture of fact & fiction."
4,"Storm trooper, and monsters, and machines, Oh My!","In typical Rollins fashon, he dishes up a cliff hanger at the end of each chapter. Strange symbols, power mad scientists, super critters, and people,and the usual desperate race against time to save the good guys and the world. All in all a great, can't put it down weekend read."
2,Not as much fun as usual,"I generally like Rollins novels because they're fine mental vacations--lots of exotic scenery, action, and thrills, light on the characterizations, and don't take themselves too seriously. They're good to read on the afternoon commute or over a solo dinner. This one lacked, mostly because it tried for a serious tone regarding Evil Nazi Experiments and Conspiracies with Tibet thrown in for good measure--and only came out as tired. I was left with the impression that Mr. Rollins needs a vacation as badly as his characters do. Maybe the next one will be better."
3,Entertaining,"James Rollins is not a very stylish writer, of depth or substance. He states plainly the purpose behind his novels on his website: entertainment value. As such, each of his novels are filled with incredibly circumstantial `get-out-of-trouble' clichés and cliffhanger moments. Still, being his goal is entertainment, his books deliver. This was a good read."
5,another fine SIGMA force adventure!,"wow!another page turning, thrill a minute tale by james rollins!and another few sleepless nights for me!i just COULD NOT put this book down!highly recommended!looking forward to reading mr. rollins' new book!"
3,Three stars for this book,"I decided to check out the book after reading some reviews and found that I was somewhat disappointed with the book. The plot of the book seemed too absurd (yes, I know it was thriller fiction, but still the plot seemed silly). The SIGMA team members are almost too ""good"" and nearly immortal in their abilities to escape danger. The book moves quickly and Rollins keeps the action going, but I just did not enjoy the book and thought the underlying plot involving Nazis, runes, intelligent design, quantum physics, etc...was too involved, too ""over the top"" and too far fetched.Not a bad read...but I wasn't that impressed."
2,Suspend Belief Requirement Too High on this one,I did put it down 3/4 of the way through. The idea that a 1930s bunch of scientists could create a machine like this was just too much to accept.
3,Too many details pertaining to physics,"Not as entertaining as the last 4 Sigma Force books I read.There were a lot of things I just couldn't grasp and I really don't feel the whole physics aspect was explained properly for someone like me who's clueless.I didn't feel that connection with any of the characters, like I felt in the previous books I read. Plus, the book was slow to get into.This Sigma Force plot went over my head and I am not pleased with how Painter's illness was dealt with at the end of the book. It was really ridiculous."
4,good book,good book. effective at capturing my interest early and keeping it. good at trying in fact with fiction. quickly took my mind off work.
2,Has It All-And It's All Laughingly Unbelievable,"Yes-this book is chock full of ex Nazis-genetically engineered monsters-Billionaire evil-doers-radioactive bells that cause de-evolution-and it all becomes sillier and more unbelievable as you continue to read.This is a book where I regret that I am a completist, since it is a laughable, but not funny, waste of time!"
4,Rip-Roaring Adventure,"Black Order is the third book in James Rollins' Sigma Force series. Sigma Force is the covert ops branch of DARPA and is task to investigate potentially dangerous technology based research around the world. Black Order focuses on technologies that were continued by the Nazis after the second World War, in this case quantum mechanics and its applications to eugenics. The action takes place in Eastern Europe where someone is desperately trying to obtain Darwin's family Bible, the Himalayas where a strange disease is affecting a monastery, and South Africa where strange beasts are attacking the wildlife the the government is trying to cover it up. It is up to the Sigma Force to uncover these mysteries. Rollins does a good job with Black Order keeping the suspense going. It starts with a bang and does not let up for a good way into the book. This was a fun rip-roaring adventure with an interesting plot. It was a lot of fun to read and a great addition to Rollins' work."
3,"Eh, it's ok","I read a lot of thrillers/mysteries by a wide range of authors. This is the first James Rollins book that I have read. I would rate it so-so; it was an entertaining read, but nothing to get excited over. There are much better choices out there. That being said, if I had nothing to read, I would pick up another of his books."
3,Decent read,"This is an interesting novel. In a time that historical and 'mystical' plots and stories are fashionable and very entertaining, James Rollins gives us an interesting read.I would have rated this novel with 3 and a half stars but unfortunately Amazon does not this us this choice yet.Having said that I would recommend this book. THe plot is decent and despite the fact that it does have some holes in it (I would not want to elaborate as not to ruin it for the future reader), the characters are well developed and work very well with each other.The story takes place in present time and it deals, as the back cover of the book claims with the origin of life . The reader will, from the prologue, find out that it has something to do with the Nazi experiments. There are three parallel stories that do intrigue the reader on their relevance but eventually they tie very well together.All in all a decent read that one should enjoy"
3,Not the best novel by James Rollins,"I have loved every book by James Rollins, but this one is not my favorite. It is okay, but not the greatest. I did, however, purchase his next book, and hope that one is better. His first books were fabulous."
4,Sigma Force Strikes Again!,"Here's another great book about a group of black-op commandos. Sigma Force is back with nail-biting intensity and action, as well as wonderfully woven stories from all points of the globe that come together in this fine tale. Black Order is well done and, at least for me, held my attention throughout without thinking that certain parts of the novel were too far fetched as with some of his earlier works. Well done.I love novels regarding black-ops, which is probably why I liked this novel more than his earlier works. I'll have to pick up more Sigma Force titles. But if you are a reader of intense thrillers with black-op units and superstar protagonists, then read Richard L. Jones' The Vatican Knights (very intense) and all of Vince Flynn's books. Other recommendations would be anything from James W. Huston and Chris Stewart.However, Black Order is highly recommended."
1,Drivel,"Makes the Da Vinci code look like it was written by Gore VidalThe Black Order is insultingly under reasearched, trite, and idiotic."
3,Not as good as the other Sigma Books,"Having read Rollins' prior Sigma Force books this one doesn't quite measure up. It is a combination of Nazi world domination with Jurassic Park thrown in. A secret Nazi experiment at the end of the war seems to have fallen into other meglamaniac hands. A device using quantum science has killed several Lamas in Nepal and Painter Crowe is seriously ill from the device. He gets captured and tries to get free while looking for a cure for himself before his affliction kills him. Meanwhile agent Gray is in Germany battling other bad guys who are after a Charles Darwin Bible.The book builds to a climax that is fairly predictable, even the last scene (which finally brings the last pieces together)."
4,awesome book,Gripping from the first pages. Don't start this until you have a pretty good chunk of time available. You won't want to need to put the book down. Elaine Garrett
3,Action Packed Scenes But Not A Compelling Read,"This was my first experience reading the author. My thoughts are somewhat mixed. The basic plot was about two separate groups that were started by the Nazi's as they lost the war. One was based in a Shangri-La type setting Himalayas the other in South Africa. They were both working to carry on The Master Race thru genetic and quantum research. They were ultimately thwarted by members of Sigma Force and Lisa Cummings, an American doctor working in Nepal. The plot concept was fine. There were plenty of quite exciting encounters in various parts of the world. The problems I had were I thought the book was just too long and I had no burning desire to keep reading. In my view, a top notch thriller should almost compel you to keep reading. So, all in all, I thought it was okay. But, from my perspective, not outstanding."
4,The First,This is my first time reading a James Rollins book and I am looking forward to the next book. Excellent read.
5,Awesome,"The newest of James Rollins lovels leaves no disappointment. His tradition of exciting plots, believable and likeable characters, and twists that keep you guessing all the way through continue in Black Order. The way he combines real science with fiction is amazing! I can't get enough."
4,Fantastic,"Nonstop Action. Having just finished both Map of Bones and Black Order I can hardly wait for the next assignment for Sigma Force.James Rollins manages to blend his superb imagination with his own interests, faith and knowledge extremely well. I know very few people with the abiltiy to bring all of this together, much less put it into novel form. Put this on your summer reading list!!"
4,"Nazis and genetics, what fun!","A book typical of Rollins' Sigma Force series - and that's a good thing. A rousing, interesting tale that makes for a very good bit of entertainment. It's helpful but not essential to read these books in order, as with most series. But there's enough recap to get the essential facts if you haven't read earlier works, but not so much that it distracts if you have read them."
5,Hooked!,"This was my first Sigma Force series book that I read and I promptly bought more. It's smart, historical fiction, action packed, a little science fiction with a wink and a nudge to a political thriller = it completely filled every need I had. The characters are mostly bouncing around Europe, but I also enjoyed the small glimpses into their personal lives; it made the characters that much more real. Also, I've been a fan of Steve Berry's Cotton Malone series and I liked the way that the author tipped his hat to Mr. Berry's character early on in the book. I'll be taking a closer look at all of Mr. Rollins' books."
5,Black Order,FAST PACE. A great jigsaw puzzle!! Moves FAST & furious. Did not want to put the book down!! Great read.
4,Great Book,"Jim did a great job. Loved that he gave back stories on the characters. I only wish that I had read this one last. I've picked up the first two so I'll be reading them soon. Again, great book."
3,Quite a tale!,"This was my first try at a book by this writer. I don't know that I will try again. The story itself is OK, but even for an action/suspense/thriller, it is a bit over the top. The action is frenetic, the scenes shift rapidly and many of the situations and discourses are sophomoric. On the other hand, it hits you with brain teasing discussions of quantum physics. An interesting book."
4,Vienna Boys Choir,"This is a CD made from a very old recording . . . possibly in the early 50's . . . but it was exactly what I have been trying to find for several years. It features carols I remember from my childhood and is, I believe, from a set of records my family had. I was thrilled to finally find a CD of this set of records that can no longer be played."
5,"Nice tool, works well on exhaust side of honda accord.",I bought this tool to adjust the valves on my wife's 1999 Honda Accord. Works great on the exhaust valves but the wires for the injectors and random hoses interfere with the tool on the intake side.A great tool to as it saves time and reduces error while tightening the jam nut.
5,Does what it should,Used this tool for adjusting the valve lash on my B18c5 Honda motor. The tool is quick and easy to use. Other tools use 2 separate pieces (that could wander apart) and you still need to supply a wrench. This is a one piece solition. A valve adjustment at the shop costs about 100 bucks. It paid for itself many times already.
2,Wronge size,"This wrench is supposed to work on a 1995 acura integra RS, per item decription. Was wronge size car is 12mm wrench was 10mm. I did the job perfectly fine with a regular wrench and screwdriver. Oh Well."
4,it works,"if your using this tool for a non gsr or type r motor it will not work becouse the lock nut on a b18 motor is a 12mm,other than that it works"
2,ok but not necessary,"I tried it but soon went back to a screwdriver and wrench, it is a little difficult to hold and you tend to put to much downward pressure on the rocker arm while adjusting."
5,Just get it....,"Works exactly as it is supposed to. Makes valve adjustments a snap! Just remember to re-torque separately the jam nuts as it's hard to get a mechanics ""feel"" for torque with this tool."
5,Great tool,It would be almost impossible to adjust valves on a H22 without this tool. What a great invention. Saves a lot of money compared to the $50 OEM tool.
5,Great valve adjustment tool!,This is the best honda/acura tool for any do it yourselfer lookin to adjust your own valves! it makes the job sooo easy and it is a must have! Its high quality and the lowest price in the United States. Shipping was only $5 and it beat eBay's remarkably low pricing! This 10mm tool works on most honda/acura engines.
4,a great tool,I used this tool on a 99 honda 2.3l. This tool worked great when i had the head off and adjusting valves. the downfall is when i checked the valves after the head was installed. i could not get to the intake valve due to the intake manifold being in the way. other than that a great tool
5,works for my s2000,I used this to adjust the valves on my s2000. it works well and give you a good amount of leverage to turn the lock nut
5,What a jewel for the Church!,"I've just finished skimming your new work and am delighting in it. I've preached and taught Proverbs several times in the last 15 years and how I wish I'd had this in my hands then. The book fills a desperate need in the world of commentaries and study helps... it grabs the MEANING of each proverb, but then ""preaches"" it, giving exposition, illustration, and application. The Wisdom of Proverbs is a great service to God's people."
2,...dissapointed,"i have read the two previous books, and could not wait til i got to read ""When love commands."" However, the story seemed to drag in the middle of the book, there was nothing really happening. When i finally got to the end, and i thought everything was going to be happily-ever-after, there was this very unpleasent surprise... and it totally ruined it for me, i did not like jeremy bond anymore, and the whole thing seemed like a waste, i wish i had just stopped reading the series at ""love me marietta"" so i would have stayed satisfied with the books."
5,"Captivating and emotional, I couldnt put it down!","This was an exceptional book! The charectors came alive and were believable. The dialog was witty and realistic. The hero, Raymond was strong and opinionated but also kind and gentle. The heroine Juliana, was not the typical snotty rich girl or sniveling idiot, she has depth and layers. Both charectors evolved and changed into better people for having met eachother. This was my first Christina Dodd book, I am a very picky romance reader. I cant just pick up any romance and enjoy reading it. It has to have depth and mystery and most of all the people need to pop into life and this book has that. I am on line now to order some more"
4,"Good book, not among Christina Dodd's best","This is an enjoyable medieval romance, but not quite up to Christina Dodd's usual standards. Not as good as ""Candle in the Window"", I had hoped for better for the character of Raymond of Avrache. Some characters were either stereotyped or unbelievable (elderly female acrobat squires?)"
3,Glad I picked it up at the library,"Castles in the Air was a nice read, a sweet character driven love story that was very humble. I give it 3 stars because if I had another book here to read I could have easily set down Dodd's story and not given it another thought for a few weeks. It was slow and a little boring. The only thing that kept me reading was the whimsy of the main and secondary characters. The castle description used in England during the 12th century was pretty good and there were a few things I don't remember learning from any other historical romance set in that time period.Overall it was ok, definitely a little cheesier then I enjoy but it was a nice easy read after reading Diana Gabaldon's Voyager."
2,Corny,I thought this book was corny and the dialogue was forced and repetitive. A good book for the beach maybe when you're not expecting much....
1,Have mercy on your ears,"This recording may be important historically. Only buy this CD if you are a diehard history buff of Gilbert and Sullivan and enjoy listening to cylinders or 78's. The hiss and pops are dominant and cannot be ignored. Save your nerves, ears and money and buy a more recent recording."
4,Nice Sandal,"These are a good pair of sandals. The sole or foot cushionings are a lot like the Dr. Scholl's gel shoe insterts. very comfortable.The only problem i have with the sandal is the upper velco portion is covered in a black natural leather that is kind of suede and does not fair well if it gets wet, so do not plan on getting these sandals wet or use them for summer time fun in the water, unless you want them to look shabby. Personally i like the leather upper velco strap for its esthetic and unique looks.I would get another pair of these in the future."
3,"Nice pendant, but poor quality chain",I'm very pleased with the pendant. It's good quality and a nice size. I get compliments every time I wear it. My complaint is that the chain broke the first time I wore the necklace. I contacted the company several weeks ago and have been unable to get a response from them.
2,cheap chain,The charm is great i love this charm.. the chain is very cheap though it broke within the first few days.. i did nothing to it just had it around my neck and it just snapped.. dont know why..but the charm is definately worth it.. just be aware that you may be buying a new chain shortly after..
4,attention getter,"I prefer silver or white gold jewelry, so this necklace was quite a find for me. It's a quality product for a very good price and it arrived very quickly. Everytime I wear it people ask me about it or compliment it. I would prefer that the chain either be a little shorter or a little longer, but that's probably just a personality quirk. ;) Also, it's a little dark in the crevices, but most people probably wouldn't even notice. I would buy it again though, no question."
2,Ordered Wrong-Will Give To First Request,"It was only $2, no sense returning. If you need this, send me a self addressed, pre-paid envelope and I'll give it to you."
2,VGA to Video converter,"It did not work for my application, but I am trying to something it was not intended for. I was trying to connect the SVideo from my Verizon SD receiver to the monitor that I have with VGA input. I did got the picture, but it was black and white, no color."
3,Should have read the reviews first....,Purchased in a hurry and did not do my research. This item CANNOT connect your computer to your TV.
2,did not work correctly,"laptop has tv-out. cord does not work correctly. when plugged into laptop, tv shows 3 parallel black and white, fuzzy images."
1,Not for Laptop to standard TV,"This product did not work to hook up my Laptop to a standard old projection TV. You have to buy an actual converter box to xfer from digital to analog, which this product does not do. My roommate bought a converter box for about $100 and it works just fine. Possibly if you have an HD-TV this may work but then just buy an HDMI cable."
1,VGA to RCA S-VIDEO CABLE,Product did not work nothing happens when i attached the yellow video cable or the s-video cable after the VGA cable is plugged into the computer
1,"Good Idea, but bad construction","I ordered this like many other people despite the bad reviews. The idea for this cable is what makes it the most appealing as well as the price. I mean connecting your computer to your TV for under $5 AFTER shipping and handling? Who can really turn that down?So, ordered the product and it got here within about a week, which is normal here. I tested the product rather throughly making sure that it wasn't my error. Sure enough I should have listened to the reviews. Therefore I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this product. It will never work, ever."
1,This does not work!!!,"This cable DOES NOT WORK! It was supposed to be able to transmit whatever is displayed on my computer's screen, through its VGA port, to a TV. It does not work at all. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Waste of my money."
3,Does Not Work with Dell Studio S15,"I tried this with the Dell Studio S15. It does NOT work. If I figure out a way to get it to work, I will surely post it here."
1,dont work,this cable don't works! I coonected to laptop and tv tuner out and no video!I don't recommend this product.and the fabricant or the store that sale this cable not contact to me and dont care our opinion.
1,doesn't work,"this product doesn't work. it physically connects your monitor jack to a svideo cable, but the picture that shows up on the television is scrambled."
2,Not compatible,"Unfortunately, this item was not compatible to my tv. It may work for the newer, flat screens."
2,Doesn't work on EMachine or Dell Lat E6400,"Both the emachine and the dell support ""TV OUT"" from the vga port - however neither manufacture could tell me how to get this cable to work. Others are saying this worked for them - but if you are using an emachine or a Dell Latitude E6400 - its not going to work - despite the assertion from the vendors that the computers/laptops support TV Out from vga...Don't cheap out - you will have to buy a convert - which I ended up doing. Even with a converter - the signal is hazy - for video its not unbearable, but reading text is impossible. My emachine has hdmi out - but my HD TV is over 5 years old and does not have HDMI in - I tried this cable and several others - and I currently have the PC2TV converter that converts the vga out to S-video and RCA - both are hazy... in the end the truth is, its time for a new TV..."
1,READ B4 U BUY!!!!,This is not a PC to TV cable. If u want to use it for that do not buy this!!! It will not work.
3,Oh well...,"I have an HP 2000 laptop. I wanted to put the display from my laptop onto my old analog TV. I read the reviews and was not sure if this cable would work with my laptop. It did not work, but for $2, it was worth a try."
3,Shouldn't Believe U Can Get A Good Cable At Cheap Price...,This Is My 2nd One But It Still Didn't Work Just Fuzz Shows Up When I Use It And I Know It's Not A Problem With My Laptop Nor My TV But I Guess You Cant Expect A Good Cable for a Good Price.
4,good,works in windows not in my linux. i tired using this with arch and arch never detected it. as well ubuntu couldnt detect it. windows does so not to bad.
1,le tv-out vga to s-video rca cable adaptor,it does not work at all plugs in fit fine but won't work wish i had my money back for something else
1,Doesn't Work,After waiting for a month this cable doesn't do anything...tried it on different devices same result. lost of time and money
3,Worked but not what I needed it for,Adapter itself worked however I was trying to make my laptop play on my Sony Bravia TV and while I had a VGA port the graphic card or something did not allow for displaying on a TV so it didn't work for me but not the cable's fault.
3,investigate before buying,probably if it works but I do not probe it worked with 3 machine and none achieved to take out the image to the TV so I put 3 stars on that page and noticed that depended on the video controller.
1,Fake Product,"I am 99% sure that this is a fake product. Someone got a bunch of salvaged parts and started creating these fake adapters out of them. They sell them for very cheap, so it is more trouble to return them than it is worth. Add a little something about them not working for all video cards and they're off the hook."
2,Works only with certain Laptop,It works fine depending on the laptop video card. it is not working in one of my laptop.
1,Always read reviews first,I can't believe amazon even sells this item. It doesn't work period. What a waste of money.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! Rip-Off,"Do not order any products from eforcity. They will take your money and stiff you on the product. I ordered this cable and waited about three weeks. It never showed up. Clicking on the email link to track my package only came up with an error message. It has been three months, I have tried countless times to get in contact with them and there have been ZERO responses. Don't give these scamers your money."
3,Be careful of what you expect.,"This is a nicely made piece, but don't expect it to take the VGA output of your computer and convert it to S-video/RCA. It won't do that."
4,Product Is What It Is,"The product description stated that this cable would connect your laptop to your television. I guess it does connect them, if by that you mean an end plugs into both devices. This cable WILL NOT allow you to watch your laptop on your television. Instead of buying this, go ahead and buy a converter. There are several under $20 that work great!"
1,"Fuzzy, staticky, and generally crappy","This did not work at all for me, and for the price, I'm not too surprised. It wasn't dead on arrival, but it was just generally a piece of junk. It transmitted a stacky image, like the type that screams and hisses at you when you turn your TV to a dead channel, and it just didn't seem to be anything else but a con. Don't buy."
1,peice of crap,The cable didn't do as I intended. The image on the television was grainy and horrible. THIS CABLE WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO CONNECT YOUR COMPUTER TO YOUR TELEVISION.
2,didnt work,Unfortunately it does not appear that this cable is compatible with my EVGA graphics card and my dvd vcr player
1,POOR,it did not even work. I plugged it in and it did nothing with multiple devices. This is a poor product and i would rate zero stars...Do not buy!!!
1,Fraud,"To the best of my knowledge, after talking with people in electronics retail, this product is a FRAUD. A cable cannot overcome the language barrier separating VGA and RCA systems of information-storage. For at least 90% of the customers who would want to order this item, it is simply a scam, a con.I'm not super computer-savvy, but I think I've heard that some more expensive computer video-cards have a feature called something like ""TV out."" Perhaps they could use this cable. Mine couldn't. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours.KM"
4,Great,great item I just plug the other end with a s video cable and boom my laptop screen was on my tv!
1,Don't buy this.,Don't buy this. Requires a VERY specific video card to be compatible and work. If you have the right card (check the fine print) then maybe it'll work. But mine is now helping me create my very own pile of useless crap.
1,DOES NOT WORK DO NOT BUY,"should have known, but this is fake, it does absolutely nothing. You need a active computer chip to convert the VGA image format into the RCA/S-video composite one. This does not do that"
1,worst thing you will ever buy,"i bought this thing and when it came in the mail, i tested it. it didnt work. so i contacted the seller and asked them why it didnt work, so they agreed on sending me another one.they agreed on giving it to me for free, but THEY CHARGED ME FOR IT!!!! then when i tested the new one, it STILL DIDNT WORK. so if you are going to buy this, DONT BUT IT FROM EFORCITY. PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE FOR A NICE ONE THAT ACUTALLY WORKS"
1,Doesn't work with almost ALL computers,Terrible. Simply doesn't work with almost any computer. Does not work on Macs
1,aweful,"this thing is a joke. I didn't think about it before buying it but unless your video card converts sample rates, hz, size, and all that other stuff this will be useless. Most people looking at this are trying to find a cheap scan converter. This is not that product! don't waist your money."
1,planned obsolescence,"Apparently this device is not enough for Windows 7 or XP to communicate with devices via S-video. Perhaps it works fine with an OS that's older, or with Linux or Apple, but that makes it pointless for the majority of users. Like me."
5,It's about freakin' time!!!!!!!!!,"There's about a half dozen Rick Springfield compilation CD's out there and they all have pretty much all the same songs on all of them but not this new release, At last something differen't! all the songs have been remastered and sound great, the artwork and inserts look great. So even though a fan of Rick might have all these songs already it's still a great CD to add to the collection."
5,"Great, great read","The was the first DeClements book I read. And I loved it! The characters were so well written and so realistic! This is a great book for kids around the ages of 10 to about 13. Even though I'm well over 13, I still enjoy this book! It deals with divorce and making new friends... Starting over, you know? I hope you all read this!"
1,not very happy,I have never recieved my CD yet I ordered it from amazon and you have an outside supplier fill the order thay never sent it yet. Everything I've ordered from amazon have came in a timley manner but not Al Hurt
2,It's a Chinese sax.,"It's a Chinese Sax, so don't expect much from it! The one I bought came with laquer flaws, sticking pads and the bell keys with bending problems (leaking). But, if you pay another hundred dollars on a repair shop, it will turn into an average good instrument."
3,"fast service, incomplete item",This seller shipped the saxophone fast. I received it 2 days after I purchased it. The used saxophone was in accceptable conditions as the seller wrote. It's just fine for a beginner... BUT it didn't included the neck strap. The neck strap it's a must. Every sax comes with one.
5,"It Works, whoooooo","Product works with Windows 7, interfacing with a AVR programming board (STK500). Length is a plus, as well as the fact it's a male header all the way through."
3,Did not work for me,"Does not necessarily mean it is a bad product.Shipping was quick and pricing fair.However didn't do anything for me after a week, so I stopped.But every body reacts differently, I guess.Plus I have sometimes phases of insomnia that needs prescription medication."
5,Buy this disc!,"This was my first John Kelly CD, but I'm very glad I purchased it! It's a great disc and a must have for compilation collectors. The mixing is a 9 out of 10 with only a few minor noticable adjustments during song changes ... one of my favorites right now ..."
4,"If you're afraid of your own voice, this book will help.","This book, used in conjunction with Natalie Goldberg's ""Writing Down the Bones,"" helped me to develop the discipline to write every day. I ordered it twice - once for myself and once for a friend."
5,A book to give to all your friends and family,"This is a wonderful book! It is one which helped me, and could help anyone who has ever desired to create anything, from a Pulitzer-level work of art to a community craft activity. Maisel outlines both the big picture principles of creativity and what blocks us, as well as very detailed, practical exercises which guide the reader through the logical, common sense steps of creativity. I've given it to five friends already!"
3,Disappointing,"I found this book to be lacking in creativity. While some of the exercises in the book were useful in getting me started writing, parts of the book put me to sleep, which did nothing to enhance my creative process.I recommend ""Writing Down the Bones"" by Natalie Goldberg for anyone wishing to write more creatively."
3,Something for when that drreaded block strikes,"This book is helpful on many levels. First as a philosophical treatise on creative acts, then a well indexed guide to specific processes. The side tabs are intriguing, but I did't try baking the potato, imagining it was enough."
4,Excellent!,"This is a wonderful recording of short pieces. Heifetz plays everything wonderfully-Tzigane in particular. My only reservation is the sound, which is disapointing. This still comes highly recommended."
3,iranian compilation with material from the early 1970s,"tracklist:1-Googoosh, Gheseh Vafa2-Vigue, Mahtab3-Ramesh, Namaz4-Dariush, Be Man Nagou Douset5-Elahe, Rosvaye Zamaneh6-Manouchehr, Chera Aamadi7-Simin Ghanem, Seeb8-Viguen, Dou Kaboutar9-Ramesh, Gharibeh10-Aref, Bagh Barounzadeh11-Hayedeh, Tanha ba Golha12-Banan, Elahe Naz"
3,PE exam: geotechnical eng.,This is a good book for exam preparation. But don't solely rely on it as bible.
4,Great kid's CD player,"Got this for my just turned 7year old daughter to replace an older sing along CD player that went toes up. So far I've been impressed with the sound quality, the durability, and actually the compactness of the unit. It's smaller than the one we had previously and lighter too. I like the digital controls (the old one had analog/knobs) and the case holder in the back is a huge plus. Now when she changes CD, she has the case in the back to put it where it's supposed to be, instead of just laying it somewhere. There is also a volume limiter switch inside the battery compartment if you so choose to limit how high the volume can get.Overall, we are very pleased!"
3,Overpriced,I was hoping I would get a really good quality cd player for my 5 year old son. I paid 60.00 for this when it was not on sale here. The cd player skips and makes beeping noises sometimes while just sitting on a table. We have had it for 5 months. I would say this cd player would be better priced at 20.00-25.00
2,don't be misled,"Don't be misled by the word karaoke. I assumed it means you can plug into a tv, play karaoke CDs on it and sing to the words. All they mean by karaoke is that you sing into a microphone and your voice comes over the speakers. I am disappointed I did not investigate the product more. I think it is misleading to use the work karaoke to describe this product. Karaoke was not in the title of the product but it was in the product features.In addition. The volume button is not easy for kids to use. There is quit a bit of the microphone feedback squeal the gets annoying. Seems durable so far. The screen to show what track it is on an such is very small and difficult to read.Not worth the price."
3,"Fun, but not very durable","My kids love this toy, but it's not very durable. After a year, it started to not work well. I thought it was because the batteries kept running out, but then I got a DC adapter and it still didn't work. They should also sell the DC adapter for this. It runs through batteries pretty quick and it was difficult for me to find the correct adapter. I finally found one at the local Radio Shack. You need to take the instructions with you so that you get the right voltage and polarity. Great concept, but it was a little too expensive for the durability."
3,Not kid tough,My son got this Cd player for Christmas and it worked for about a month and then the CD player stopped working. I was really disappointed that it broke so easily. Granted my boys are tough on electronics but I really thought it would hold up better.
2,Didn't last the week,My two year old son received this as a Christmas present. After two days of fun it no longer plays CDs. I am sure that he dropped it but I expected more durability.
3,Little Kids Karaoke Player,I was looking for a CD Player with two microphones. This is all I could find. It is OK. I wish it was more durable and the buttons worked better. The volume control was hard to get working and this sound from the CD wasn't loud enough. The directions were not detailed enough.
3,Track listing:,"1) ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" 2:19 / 2) ""Bel Raggio Lusingheir"" 8:33 / 3) ""Una Voce Poca Fa"" 6:43 / 4) ""Depuis Le Jour"" 5:49 / 5a) ""Ben Lo T'Invenni"" 5b) ""Anch'io Dischiuso Un Giomo"" 7:24 / 6) ""Addio Del Passata"" 2:59 / 7) ""Casta Diva"" 5:25 / 8) ""Sucido"" 4:34 / 9a) ""Nel Di Della Vittiro"" 9b) ""Vieni T'Affretta"" 5:22 / 10a) ""Surta E La Notte..."" 10b) ""Ermani, Ermani, Involami"" 8:27"
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT ! ! !,"There are no words to describe how disappointed I am in this CD.I am a huge fan of Babyface. I love his writing / producing and 99% of his songs from previous years. I own several CDs, but this is the absolute worse. I can understand attempting to integrate more uptempo songs on the CD, but what happened to our talented Babyface. Since when does he need help writing songs? Baby's mama is probably the worse. I miss the love songs, not necessarily begging, but songs that depict love, and being in love. This is a 360 degree change that I just do not appreciate from an artist that has so much to offer. Do yourself a favor and purchase it used if you must get it at all. I will be awaiting the next CD but cautious before spending my money."
3,A Different Babyface,"In all honesty, this album has had to grow beacuse it's not what I expected from Babyface. I couldn't wait to purchase this CD, and on first listen, I didn't have any comment.Because it is a different side of Babyface, it's not a bad CD. I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed because there aren't more slow tempo songs. I do think Babyface scores a big hit with ""What If"". One song that I truly like is ""I Keep Calling"". I absolutely can not get with the ""Baby's Mama"". What would a Babyface CD be without any ballads? The ballads are always beautiful, just like ""With Him"" on this CD.While it won't be on my ""favorites"" list, I'm sure Babyface will win some new fans with this."
4,FACE2FACE,"I have loved Babyface's music for years. I have always been abble to vibe with him and that has not changed with this album. Yes he's change and gone a little more hip/hop and he sounds different, but all in all it is still a wonderful album. Although I do still prefer the ballads, I truly enjoy 90% of the songs and I love this album. Change is sometimes good and this is one of those times."
2,Not his best work...,"I've been a HUGE Babyface fan for many years now. Besides being a great producer, he's got an incredible voice. I rushed out to buy this new CD but was very disappointed the moment I heard it. He's tried to make a change to a hip-hop/heavy R&B sound and it just doesn't work. A few of the songs are classic Babyface...smooth sounding, harmonized...but the majority aren't at all pleasant to listen to. I really hope he goes back to his old style and abandons this effort!"
2,Hit&alot of Miss,"""wish you were My Girl"" is one of the few Jams that works here but by&Large this ain't working.Babyface My Brother You Missed making the Musical Change by 6 Years.drop this back in 96 or 97 this would have been the Jump but Nowadays it's no Biggie doing this Material with the Neptunes.Babyface without a doubt as Important as any Musical Figure over the last 15 Years but on a whole He lost His Edge here.cool He changed up but if He were going for Funk hook up with Rick James,Bootsy Collins(The Man that Gave Him His Stage name)or George Clinton.Get that Curtis Mayfield Vibe Right half-Baked or that Al Green Smoothness it ain't happening here.Babyface has Proven His Many talents but this doesn't work to me."
1,What ever happen to Baby?,"I was ready to purchase this album without even had heard it yet, but I'm glad I didn't because when I did hear it I was dissapointed. Come on Kenneth B.F. Edmonds, what are you doing? Where is the cool in you balladeer that turned my car stereo into love land. Why are you experimenting with all these styles that takes away the foundation you're known for. I'm a musician my self and no I'm still waiting for Babyface to show up. Sorry but this one is not good at all. Snoop and Face does not work. Will someone call the rescue squad and get Baby face back before the cold of winter. Thumbs down on this one."
2,Not What I Expected,"I have every cd Babyface has released. I go back to his Manchild days, and then to the Deele. I was so disappointed with this. Babyface using profanity is not something that I ever thought I'd hear. There are 3 or 4 songs worth listening to; What if, how can you be down, baby's mama (maybe), and with him. Else, this is without question the worst cd Babyface ever released."
2,why did you do it babyface?,"BABYFACE IS MY FAVORITE ARTIST. I LOVE EVERYTHING HE HAS EITHER WRITTEN OR SUNG BECAUSE I THINK HE IS A VERY SENSITIVE ARTIST AND IT IS REFLECTED IN THE WORDS OF HIS SONGS. THAT BEING SAID, I MUST EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT IN HIS LATEST CD FACE 2 FACE. BABYFACE HAS STRAYED FROM WHO HE IS AS AN ARTIST AND BECOME SOME UNDEFINABLE WANNABE. BABYFACE IS NOT HARDCORE AND NEVER WILL BE SO WHY IS HE TRYING TO CHANGE HIS IMAGE? I DO NOT LIKE THIS NEW BABYFACE AND I HOPE HE GOES BACK TO WHO HE IS AS AN ARTIST."
3,ENJOY BABYFACE'S MUSIC - BUT,"I enjoy Babyface's music very much, but this CD I didn't care for. Maybe, because it's different than what were use to hearing from him. It's not a real bad CD, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,Leave It Alone!!!,"This CD by Babyface was one of the most anticipated releases in sometime, ... Babyface is trying to convince the listener (& himself!!) that he can be a R&B; badboy, singing with outdated rappers (Snoop Dog) & using profanity.Babyface also invited some of the hottest YOUNG producers (the Neptunes, etc.) to update his 'sound'.Bad move!! (If Babyface needs outside producers, then get one for Prince & Stevie Wonder!!) The songs just don't fit Face, and he sounds very limited as a singer on this CD.If you must have this CD, getting a used copy shouldn't be a problem!!My advice is to get any of his previous CDs on Epic/CBS, which have been remastered with BONUS tracks, or just get the 'Ultimate Collection' for a summary of the Babyface music that matters.This is just the lattest flop by the new 'L.A. Reid led' Arista label!!"
1,Why the Change.,"I have been a fan of babyface since he was in the group ""the Deele"". I love the music, like they would say: this man can sang. he's a very talented man. even though i did not buy this cd i heard little portions of it and i was truly disappointed. babyface stick to what you do best- love ballad and pop. please ,please, please come back out with the songs that we love so much. i still love you though.stay the same."
5,Bulb,"Works great, takes a bit for it to turn on but it comes on. Helps me alot. Thanks for the speedy service."
2,coulda been a contender,"The divas are indeed divine, but the choice of music sung left me wondering why, with so many other great music selection contenders."
4,Should you buy Open Water on DVD or Blu-ray?,"I'm not really going to talk much about the movies themselves, but my opinion is that Open Water is a good film, and Open Water 2 is a laughably bad one.As for the decision to buy this 2-pack blu-ray ($9) or the Open Water DVD ($3) it really depends on you. The video quality of the blu-ray looks just like a DVD (or worse, due to the source material) most of the time. They also have the same supplements. So, really, the decision comes down to two things: audio quality, and whether or not you want to own Open Water 2 to make fun of it with your friends. If you are listening to this movie with a 5.1 surround receiver, I say go with the blu-ray. The lossless audio track does sound pretty good and makes you feel like you're out there floating in the ocean with them. However, if you're listening through the speakers on your TV, you will not hear any difference, so save the $6 and just buy the DVD (unless of course you want Open Water 2.)"
2,why open water2?,why is it the blu ray edition has to come with Open Water 2? The movie is horrible. Open Water 1 is a great movie but will not buy this version even tho price is cheap. If they decide to release Open Water 1 on it's own I will buy it. Open Water 2 is a waste of space.
4,Science IS Simple!,"I bought this for my 4 yo son 3 yo daughter. It does seem a bit geared for the classroom but VERY easily adaptable to the homeschooler. I like having a few different activities to help the children relate to. I also appreciate the ""What to talk about"" area to give me a jumping off point for discussion. For me this book helped me put very basic concepts into activities and language for my preschoolers to understand."
5,Great Science Activity book,This book is great for teachers. It has so many activities to choose from and definitely worth the money (even though it is not much).
3,"This is for teachers, not moms","Based on the reviews I purchased this book for my 4 y.o. daughter who loves science experiments. This book is a very detailed lesson plan for teachers. Several pages are dedicated to each experiment. My problem is that when my dd wants to do experiments I need to be able to quickly see the ""ingredient"" list (to see if I have everything) and have a 1.2.3. of what to do to accomplish it. Because when it's over with she's going to want to do another one. While I do have some time to plan ahead I really don't need or want the info given to prepare for a classroom environment. We also received ""Everything Science"" for kids and that book was much more tailored to my daughters (and my) attention span."
5,science is simple,many activities for preschoolers to try out. I needed ideas to try out for my children. they love the activities and learn at the same time.
5,Science for Pre K,I ordered this book in hopes to get some different ideas for experiments to do in my classroom to compliment my lessons. This did not disappoint me. I was very happy with this purchase.
3,Simple? Really?,"If you are a parent, looking for science activities for your kids, this is most definitely not the book for you. If you are a homeschooler or teacher, then it might be more appropriate. Simple is not a page-long essay about how to look at a cricket with a magnifying glass. Simple is fun, easy, and exciting. Well - at least for preschoolers. So if you want a truly simple science book for your preschooler, I suggest ""Science Play"" by Jill Frankel Hauser. If you want to set up a detailed curriculum of activities for your kids; complete with listed objectives, where to conduct the experiments, step-by-step instructions, questions to ask, discussion points, and follow-up activities - this book might be just what you need."
5,"A welcome addition to preschool, day-care center, elementary school, and homeschooling reference libraries and curriculums.","Teaching science to preschoolers since 1998, Peggy Ashbrook draws upon her considerable experience and practical expertise in ""Science Is Simple"" to showcase 250 child-friendly activities spanning 39 fun and informative science concepts ranging from magnets, to bubbles, to insects, to volcanoes, to plant life, to physics. ""Science Is Simple"" features both solo projects and group projects; an invaluable appendix listing science websites and other resources; a bibliography of children's literature related to science concepts, letters for explaining to parents each concept to be studies by the child; open-ended questions for creativity and self-discovery; and child-involving experiments for every season. ""Science Is Simple"" will prove a welcome addition to preschool, day-care center, elementary school, and homeschooling reference libraries and curriculums."
4,Environmentally Aware!,"This book is a fascinating way to help children connect with the natural world while teaching important environmental concepts. It comes with a guide to use the book effectively, and is divided into sections of special topics. Each section contains a Native American story, discussion ideas, interesting questions, and related indoor and outdoor activities. These activities can be accomplished without expensive materials, often in or near the home or school. Oh, by the way, adults will learn from this book also!"
4,How Thunder And Earthquake Made Ocean,The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I liked the drawingand illustration on the pictures.Also I thought it wasreally creative how they traveled all around the worldto make an ocean.I really was into the book when Iwas reading it.I learned from that book that you shouldalways try to help someone that really needs help.I also thought that it was pretty cool how Earthquake andThunder made ocean.If you have any qestions aboutthe book well don't ask me go ahead and read it yourself.
3,Not as nice as the stock carpeted floor liners,"I purchased these front floor liners for my 9-7Z. I'm a bit disappointed with them. They're not as high quality as the stock ones, don't cover the dead pedal, and don't secure very well to the carpet under them. Right now, I have removed them in favor of the stock ones."
5,ACDelco 8657926 Automatic Transmission Filter,ACDelco 8657926 Automatic Transmission FilterGreat genuine product bought @ Amazon at a great price and delivered for an even greater price and lightning fast.Always try to use Genuine AC Delco products for your GM car
2,Not designed for heavy use or longevity,"I have two of these. One where the laser did not work, the cutting arm is flimsy, and the measurement is off by 1/16 - 1/8 of an inch, which messes up craft projects where precision is of utmost importance. X-acto sent me another one, but I'm so annoyed at how badly designed these trimmers are, I don't even really want to use it. I should have gotten a Dahle or something of better quality that is made for heavy usage. Save your money, folks."
2,Gridlines are not precise,"This paper trimmer has several nice features...the blade locking into the closed position, the blade staying in the open position while lining up your paper, and the 1/4 inch gridlines are all great. Unfortunately, the gridlines on the trimmer I received were not precise, resulting in inaccurate cuts. Another disappointment is that the adjustable paper guide can't be placed less than 4.5 inches from the blade...rather unfortunate if you need to align smaller paper. The trimmer is supposed to be able to cut up to 12 sheets of paper at one time, however I was unable to get a clean cut with more than 4 pages."
5,Creepy!!!,Is This Like The movie? I Was Wondering If It's Like The Old Or New One? And If It's Like The Old One At The End Does It Have The Girl Go In The Track With Latherface Having A Fit?
4,"Great mastering, but too brief.","This disc is mastered better than RCA's earlier disc, 'Stormy Weather: The Legendary Lena 1941-1958.' But, it has just 14 songs. Since it extends all the way to 1962 - and fully half of the tracks are from the 1960's - it glosses over Lena's rich, jazzy, pre-60's recordings. And, like the 'The Legendary Lena,' this disc consists of strictly RCA material, ignoring her work in the movies and for other labels. On the plus side, it does include Lena's only significant chart hit ('Love Me Or Leave Me') - which 'The Legendary Lena' does not.Bottom line - Lena need to be honored with a multi-disc set covering her whole career for multiple labels. All the same, 'The Classic Lena Horne' is a great listen - it's just not the ideal retrospective."
3,Action promises,"Passable action story promises more for the future. Lots of crazy people shooting each other, some humor, some good writing."
4,want smooth bass?,This CD gives you what you are looking for! It provides stuff that hits along with that flows. Great crusin CD!
1,Defective,After contacting Thrustmaster they came to the conclusion that I purchased a defective product.The only good thing that came from this purchase was the fact that Amazon actually had UPS pick it up at my door and paid the return shipping!! Very pleasantly surprised with Amazon. 5 stars to them!!
4,Wiggly Giggly Ball -- for dogs,"Have bought this ball for over 20 years as all the danes I have owned just love playing with it, to the exclusion of any other toy outside. Eventually, they do destroy it, but that's not the ball's fault :)"
2,Too Big,Ball is a lot larger than I thought it would be.My German Shepards ignore it.Smaller balls they go nuts over.I gave it to a friend who has Dobermans and they distroyed it.
4,Full text + helpful information,"I have to say that the information given in this book was definitely helpful. I liked how they summarized the following scene at the beginning of the scene and had commentary on the scene at the end. The commentary is definitly helpful, although it could be a little bit more in depth in places. It is particularly helpful how they define terms in the margins that may be unfamiliar to readers.Most of the information in the introduction/bio of Shakespere/etc. wasn't new to me and it seems pretty similar to the introduction in their other books, but it is still helpful for review and to readers who are unfamiliar with this information.Definitly recommended. Excellent study tool."
5,A nice overview of her Capital hits,"This includes not the original hit w/Benny Goodman, but a remake of Why Don't You Do Right, otherwise most of these tunes are her original hits, and although you also need a good samplin' of her Decca stuff(try Black Coffee & Other Delights), thsi will serve as strictly a hits cd for her Capital stuff. Such huge hist as Manana(which she wrote, and sings in a mock Mexican accent), It's A good day(another Lee original, she wrote over 300 songs), and her mega hit, the ultra hip and cool Fever. Also a great rendition of Don't smoke in besd and her last hit and most remembered other tahn Fever, Is That all there is. A great smapling of her Capital hits."
5,A different taste of music,"The Heavy Woolies' ""Sweet and Crunchy"" is the C.D. I want to put on full blast. To me, there is a unique voice. It shows humor, creativity, and talent. I think everybody needs to own this C.D. and others to come. It's just plain out fun."
5,Love this!,My husband got this installed for me fast. I love it. It is very sturdy. I like that it is mounted at the top and not the bottom like some other versions of these trash pulls. I think that makes it more stable and since you pull from the top to open the door it should last longer this way. It pulls out nice and smooth. It comes with the bins and they work great. I use a regular 13 gallon trash bag in the front bin for my garbage and I use a cloth diaper pail liner such asPlanet Wise Diaper Pail Liner (White)in the back bin for my recycling. I am very pleased with this purchase.

5,The best book on Ike,"This is a wonderful book, easy to read and very inspiring. Ike was a qunitesential american from the midwest who rose to the pinnacle of american power. Among the excellent insights in this book you will find:1) Details of Ike's creation of the Highway system, he had learned first hand that americas roads were unexceptable in the 20s.2) Ikes decision at Nromandy, where he penned a note in case of disaster.3) Ike's simple manners and soldierly conduct. The quiet demeanor that held the alliance together.4) Ike's term as president where he ended the Korean war, and created a policy of intervening to stop communism(Eisenhower doctrin).The BEST book on Ike, a wonderful account. Clearly the best book on Ike ever written. Ambrose brings his superior prose to this volume."
4,"Biased, but wonderfully readable","Ambrose edited the Eisenhower Papers project for many years and finally turned his talents on writing a large-scale biography of Ike. The Ike opus is infinitely superior to Ambrose's earlier biography on Henry Halleck and his research and knowledge about Ike is obvious throughout.The only ""criticism"" I have is that Ambrose is blatantly biased in Ike's favor and makes no bones about it. The first words in his introduction are, 'Dwight Eisenhower was a great and a good man,"" which is undoubtedly true, but a biographer should take more pains to disguise their own feelings. There is very little criticism of Ike in Ambrose's work, which borders on the hagiography. Perhaps a bit more of Harry Truman's invective towards Eisenhower could have infused these pages.Still, Ambrose is a wonderful writer and his works are always fun to read and informative. This is still the definitive look at Eisenhower, even if it is a completely uncritical examination."
4,The definitive work on Eisenhower,"If you are only going to read one biography about Eisenhower, this one-volume version by Stephen Ambrose is the one to choose. Ambrose exhibits his deep and comprehensive knowledge of his subject and in the process provides the reader with with a real sense of Eisenhower.While Ambrose does highlight Ike's shortcomings where appropriate, there is no doubt that he had a deep admiration for his subject. This admiration leads him to write the book from a certain perspective - not necessarily biased, but certainly favorably disposed. If you are looking for a different take on Ike (albeit narrowly focused on his relationship with Truman) read David McCullough's Truman.Overall, this a solid book from a great author."
5,Ambrose's labor of love,"Dwight Eisenhower helped make Stephen Ambrose's career as a historian after reading the author's biography of the obscure Henry Halleck. Ambrose repays the debt in spades with this well written authoritative account of Eisenhower's life. This is history writing at its most readable. Ambrose portrays Ike as a genuine American hero, but does not ignore the negative, such as his suspected affair during World War. Most importantly, this is a book for readers who do not want to get bogged down in the minutia surrounding every event in Eisenhower's life. What you get is a good overview, detailed enough to give a good portrait of the man behind the legend."
4,Thorough History of Ike,"Eisenhower is one of America's most interesting Presidents because at, first blush, he is so uninteresting. Ambrose's work captures him at all his angles and reveals who he really was. In Ambrose's work on Nixon, he once wrote that Eisenhower was a man born in the 19th Century who sought to protect progress while Nixon and others sought greater progress -- these types of insights make for fascinating and well-rounded reading."
5,Concise and captivating,"Eisenhower is one of the greatest leaders of our century. Ambrose really gives you the details without boring, and mundane facts. Feel what is must have been like to plan the D-Day invasion, and then deal with the Cold War. Eisenhower was a masterful leader often practicing Carnegie principles to motivate his people. Charismatic, and brilliant, people instinctively followed him. Ambrose does an awesome job of putting us in Ike's shoes."
3,I wish it was more specific.,If and when I have more time I would like to read the full two volume version of this book. I was born almost 20 years after WW2 but enjoyed this book very much. I wish it had covered the war years in a more in depth way. I was interested in his personal response to the Holocaust and his feelings about his ancestral homeland's role in the war.These subjects were not addressed at all in the abridged text. The captions for the photo section also refer to subjects not mentioned. The book talks about Ike's charm and personal skill with the British General Staff but gives too few examples of it. If you have the time read the two volume set.
3,Educational,"In Ambrose's biography of Eisenhower, the many nuances of the former President are brought to life, initially,with vivid color. However, during the Eisenhower presidency, the events that took place barely include topics that make the best seller list. The author, however, does an excellent job in describing Ike's relationships and meetings with many ""volitale"" and historical figures. Montgomery whined incessantly when things did not go his way and Patton's outrageous temper and ego were a couple of examples of the ""problems"" Ike had to deal with while leading the Allied forces in the European Theatre of Operations. Ambrose does a good job letting the reader know of the characteristics that enabled Eisenhower to take care of these situations."
5,A first-rate biography,"After reading Ambrose's so-so history of the transcontinental railroad, I was admittedly looking at reading this book with low expectations. Fortunately, this book is far superior to Ambrose's more recent work.Ambrose does a great job at showing what Eisenhower was like prior to his election as President. Although a generally affectionate work, Ambrose also points out the flaws in the man. The book shows the value of hard work and intelligence, as Ike was essentially a self-made man who got where he was without any special family or friend connections.This book also depicts the dangers of politics. As Eisenhower gets more involved in the political arena, he becomes a less admirable person, succumbing to the hypocrisy that seems inherent in that field.This is a well-written portrait of one of the more significant people of the last century. I look forward to reading the second volume and learning more about Eisenhower the President."
4,Interesting,"Having authored several related books, including the popular books on WWII: D Day & Citizen Soldiers, Ambrose reveals extensive research on President Eisenhower. He captures the essence of his life and, moreover, a lifetime of contributions to our nation & its peace and prosperity. Thorougly researched, informative, this book is an easy read that's packed with information about this general turned President."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,Nothing against the book or theauthor but I was looking fpr specific information aboautn Eisenhower's views on a particular issue and it was not covered to any degree in this book.
3,"Good book, interesting read, But Very Bias and Forgiving...","The book was good, but Ambrose seems to skip around the timeline within chapters which makes some confusion. He is very bias to the point of humorous in defending faults of the president and military leader. In critical issues of Civil Rights, Vietnam, not supporting the Hungary Revolt, not defending Marshal, being pushed around as Supreme Commander during the WWII, not taking Berlin, and Eisenhower's wife laying in bed most everyday at the white house till past noon, taking on Joe McCarther, Eisenhower's and Ambrose's true colors are shown. The best summary is when Ambrose writes (hopefully he actually didn't lift -- plagiarise --this ) ""Eisenhower wasn't a reluctant leader in many political issues, he just wasn't a leader."" The book is worth the read besides all this."
3,Dull bio of an interesting man,"Ambrose doesn't manage to totally bore me to death, but I find him highly overrated, judging from this work. He manages to turn the life of a great man into your typical boring biography. It really doesn't compare with the biographies written by Remini or the other top historians. Still, it does a fairly good job of covering Eisenhower's life and times, based very much on Ike's own writings. Moderately recommended."
4,Fun to read sequel to Tekwar.,"Shatner does it again. I enjoyed TEKWAR so much that I thought I see is Shatner and friends could do it 2 in a row. They (he?) did! I don't know if Shatner really wrote these or not. All I care is that the final product is excellent.Jake, Gomez and Beth investigate a virus that is related to Tek and Jake naturally suspects the Tek Lords. This is episode 2 of 9, that I know of. The first 5 have been read and they are fast paced, humorous and fun.Wow. The other reviews here are tough. As far as cardboard character comments are concerned, they may be for some. But I liked the movie TWISTER, and the critics said this was a bad movie because of its cardboard characters. Did you like Twister? then maybe cardboard does bother you when everything is good. Do you like fast paced mysteries set in a futuristic world? You may find this shocking but I also like Star Wars. A lot of critics don't think much of SW books either.Read tek war first. If you like it, try Tek Lords."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This is second of Shatner's original series of cops and robbers, or cops and drug dealers, in the future.Jake Cardigan is back on the case, and as a good tough guy detective, he now has a girl, and some more bad guys to deal with. In this case, the druglords involved with dealing the dangerous substance Tek. Not as good as the first book."
3,not what i thought it was,"from the cover you might think this dvd was going to have a lot of footage of surfing dogs. alas, there is only one video of dogs surfing. the rest is predictable; girls in bikinis, tan dudes on surfboards and a somewhat annoying mtv-type host. as for the music, the Atlantics are a decent surf band but nothing stood out for me as being anywhere in the realm of Dick Dale or The Ventures."
4,The Town Santa Forgot,I saw this cartoon the other day on Cartoon Network. I thought it was wonderful! I can see this cartoon becoming the next holiday classic.
4,Great to Watch,"This special was on TV and I watched it, and it was better than I expected! The character (Jeremy) is a selfish spoiled little boy (hmmm remind you of any kids you know today?!) who only thinks about himself and the next toy he can get. Its perfect to watch with any kids who are a little too focused on the gift aspect of christmas, or even if you yourself feel like you just want everything for christmas. Its also narrated by someone famous (Im forget who, maybe Dick Van Dyke...) Its funny and the goes at a fairly fast pace (for kids with short attention spans) I would love it if the Cartoon Network would release this and some other Xmas Specials on DVD."
3,A good book for sure; more req'd than what's in the woods around you though....,"I loved the book. It will help you gain a better understanding of many of the details that must be considered when building a log cabin, from tools, to site selection, to the joints used in joining log corners, to the installation of windows and doors.I will say though, that the part of the title ""using only hand tools and the woods around you"" is total bull. He calls for all kinds of things that cannot be foraged from the woods, like portland cement and 20 penny nails to name a couple.I wish I could find a book that took that title to heart and actually used only natural materials; if such a book does exsist this is surely not the one."
4,VERY GOOD,"I bought this book not planning to build a log cabin but just for general knowledge. The book is quite sound in it's advice although somebody building a log cabin today would certainly use some more modern techniques. However, I will say that if you needed to build a log structure basically by hand this book could probably get you through it. It may not be a resort but it will be dry.I particularly liked the section on rustic furniture and fence building. I built several of the projects and they turned out quite well. This book is good for any fan of the outdoors and rustic building. Just amazing to think that not too long ago this is basically how things were done."
4,Very Good,Not every book can cover every aspect of major construction project... but if you're interested in building a log cabin and rustic furniture... then this is a good start.
3,Fun to read,"But, if you are really looking how to build a log cabin by hand the old school way... then look further. Much further. I donated it to my local library. Like the title says, fun to read. I have taken a look see at a good number of books on this subject and there is a lot lacking in the way of strictly by hand building. If I find something good, I'll post it up for sure.But hey... for a few bucks, it's good for a couple of days."
2,WOW HOW BASIC,"I bought this book with hi hopes after reading the reviews posted.Got it in the mail two days ago,and have read it twice, a VERY basic book with almost no real detail, just basic overview.I'm giving it two stars only because I somewhat enjoyed it for its historical/period relevance."
1,Log cabin book,Very disapointed with this purchase. Addresses many of the aspects of building a log cabin--then presents a very general one paragraph description. Drawings and black and white photo's and many of the photo's are very hard to see without any detail--black and white are the only colors in these pics--no grays or shading. I was curious about the lack of detail in the pictures until I checked the copyright 1939.This just looks to me as if it is one last effort to wring a few dollars out of the publics pocket. A waste of money with no useable info in it.
2,Just an overview of the process,"Bought this book as i plan to start building a small cabin this fall or next spring. I have read much of the building portion of the book (other portions are repair and furniture construction) and even though i am not much of a ""follow the manual"" kind of guy - this book leaves much to be desired in the way of detail. While I know next to nothing about building cabins - this book has taught me very little that is new. So i am seeking a more comprehensive book and may end up returning this one. Or I may just get started and research each phase of construction as I go."
1,Buyer Beware,"BASE is not Carl Cox's best work. A few years ago, I saw Cox at a club in NYC and went out the next day and bought FACT2 -- a dancing/clubbing/chilling/relaxing masterpiece. No matter what kind of mood you're in it will bring you to a groovy place. It's still one of my favorites.BASE has very little in common with FACT2. It feels hastily put together, almost like Cox couldn't decide what kind of mood he wanted. Lots of mediocre dance tracks here, nothing you would particularly want to listen to outside of a tremendously loud club, the only place you could possibly appreciate this album (and even then maybe not).If you loved FACT2, do yourself a favor and save your money. Chances are you're going to be disappointed."
5,Still holds up,"This mix album absolutely stands out among bland big label mixes of the time. There's nothing cut & paste about it, tracks are truly 'blended' (MIXED) and the selection from one to the next is superb. From the tribal funk jump off on track 1 to the space disco to the Mills classic to the intense techno throwdown by the time Mike Dearborn's remix of Aphrohead's track Legion throbs in your brain, Carl destroys it the whole time. In fact, you can take this as a real example of Cox's mixing as a lot of his sets around the time this disc came out include any/all of these tracks. So, he wasn't just shilling out some garbage for Moonshine when he put this together. It's records he plays, which hardly any DJs who made ""mix"" albums for major labels in the mid to late 90's were doing. And almost 10 years later the tracks are banging."
4,"Honest, Informative, Interesting !","Fantastic set of nine stories told by nine immigrants that went on to become famous in America. From Mario Puzo to William Alfred to Jade Wong, the stories reflect equally strongly, the ""American"" social and political scenario as they do the ancestral culture of the immigrants. These are definitely stories about ""becoming"" an American, rather than just the immigrant themselves.Being a first generation immigrant myself(from India), I am often dissapointed by the so-called immigrant novels and books(for ex: Jhumpa Lahiri's relentless efforts to portray Bengali immigrants in *each* of her novels/stories irritate me now). I liked to read about the lives of people that came from places very different from each other, and from America."
4,it's definately an interesting one,"I heard this cd for the first time when i went to charleston and it absoulutely cracked me up. it's a mix of their modern day music and their true roots. it's a HARD cd to find and trust me, if you can get ahold of it, you should."
3,Nothing Special,"This a quiet a simple product with some type of bead or gel that retains water and stays a bit cool, although my never would fully dry and it seems to have a leak already, I mainly use it just as a sweat catcher for lawn work and stuff, dont expect it to make you feel like its 70 out when its 90."
4,Nice Tree - great price.,I got this tree at Amazon for $200 less than other sites selling it.It looks great. I got a lot of compliments on it. It has a lot of room between the branches for ornaments which is what I wanted. The flocking on it is just right...just on the tips as if snow actually fell on it.The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I did feel like the branches drooped just a little with my ornaments. It wasn't bad though.
5,It's all MAGIC if you don't understand CAUSE and EFFECT!,"Some countries are going places, some are not. Ever been someplace on the planet where not much of anything really works? Like lights, water, phones, transportation, agriculture, healthcare ... forget elevators.V.S. Naipaul nails the key attributes at an early age: tribalism, magic, double lives and my favorite, lack of maintenance. He looks for the best in every location but discovers what is behind the curtain. Not a politically correct book but a surprisingly accurate set of predictions and explanations. Enjoy the trip."
3,Useful Hits Comp,"Jefferson Airplane has way too many greatest hits cds out there, but this one is unusual because it veers away from the standard hits and offers a sampling of less heard vintage tunes. RCA had to stick a few of the biggest hits on here, but most of it will be obscure to those who only know the radio staples. Worth a listen if you are a big fan of kind of dated psychedelia."
3,"Great comedians, but material could have been better","Just what the title says. I like the album and it was cheap enough, but my expectations were too high when I saw who was on the album. I mean, these guys and gals are really funny, but for some reason or other, the material picked wasn't all that great."
4,An excellent CD (bought for the rare Elvis' tracks),"The ""Very Best of Ann-Margret"" is a fine collection of some of her songs. I especially like ""Slowly"" which was written by Otis Blackwell who wrote some of Elvis Presley's greatest hits such as ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""All Shook Up"" and ""Return to Sender"". Speaking of Elvis, the two duets with Elvis: ""You're The Boss"" and ""The Lady Loves Me"" are alternate takes and different from the takes of these songs found on Elvis' releases. All in all this is a very good CD. I would have liked to have seen the songs ""Appreciation"" and ""My Rival"" from the movie ""Viva Las Vegas"", but still a very good selection is found here. Bill, Topeka, Kansas"
2,heart necklace,"This necklace looks exactly how it is pictured. There is absolutely nothing special about it. In fact,it looks like a cheap piece of costume jewelry."
3,Disappointing!,"I believe I might possibly enjoy this CD more if I could actually distinguish the music better. This CD and another by Dr. José Maceda I bought at the same time both suffer from poor recording quality. I realize the recordings were purporsely made during performances at a particular venue, but perhaps a better micing technique could have been used. There's far too much ambience in the recordings, which doesn't work very well with bamboo instruments. It sounds as though the mics were at considerable distance from the performers, as if for a bootleg recording; in fact, I've heard bootlegs that presented a far better representation of the music than these recordings do."
3,"A solid reference of value, but not much zing.","The book is well organized and contains multiple illustrations of each highlighed Scriptural truth or principle. I was disappointed that many of them were quite dated (quotes from Spurgeon, Luther, and Wesley abound). If your audience isn't theologically literate to start with, many of the illustrations will have little meaning to them. The good news is that most of the examples can be translated into more comtemporary language. And with so many illustrations to choose from there should be something to suit your need."
3,Highlights of the Life of Pope John Paul II,"This eighty-three minutes DVD gives us an overview of the life of Pope John Paul II through clips of live footage, archival photography and some of his most moving orations. Like when speaking on front of a crowd in his native Poland, his compelling speech in war-torn Northern Ireland and the United Nations.It does cover his life from a small polish town to Rome. And shows us the challenges he faced along the way including deaths in his family, W.W.II and his struggle to discern what he should do with his life.The DVD includes a Gregorian Tridentine Mass celebrated by Msgr. Francis Weber. This DVD also has an option for Spanish subtitles."
5,Tyhe Best of C.J. & the Fish,"""Electric Music..."" is the best of the C.J. & the Fish albums. It is fun and well done (for the time it was recorded). Listening to this cd takes us back to a time long ago that was filled with musical freshness and diversity. This is pyscadelic music at its zenith. Never too serious, but always entertaining. Their messege seems simple and nieve today, but, it brings back memories. For those too young to remember, ""Electric Music..."" gives an honest glimpse into the world of their former hippie parents. Thank God we made it through those times ( most of us anyway). Well worth buying for any reason."
2,I Wonder what it is I'm Missing,"You can, as many probably are aware of, in several rock encyclopedias and other publications on rock and pop learn that this first album by Country Joe and the Fish is regarded as a classic, and that people with an interest in the psychedelic music of the 1960s should hear and appreciate it.This I have now done - 3-4 times. And I must say that I'm a bit confused. Compared with albums from contemporaries like the Byrds, the Doors, Jefferson Airplane and many others, I think this album falls entirely.I have a hard time finding really good songs. The vocals are mediocre at best. There may well exist excellent instrumental passages - especially solid blues guitar, but this applied course also for many of the group's contemporaries.At the end of the day, it's probably about taste, and I have to just admit that this album does not hit me."
4,Neglected psychedelic masterpiece,"I love this album although I can see it doesn't have the range of other great albums of 1967 like Sgt. Pepper, the first Doors or Hendrix, or Love's extraordinary Forever Changes [ the latter perhaps better known on this side of the Atlantic]. But the pellucid clarity of Barry Melton's guitar has never been bettered and the sheer innocent exuberance of the record remains appealing. Has there ever been a more splendid interplay of lead guitars than on Death Sound, or a more sparkling testament to the joys of lysergic nature than Porpoise Mouth? Add it to your collection immediately!"
1,You should check out for other San Francisco groups,"When i listened to this CJ & the fish album, i was deeply disappointed. The keyboard really sounds cheezy and don't lead anywhere. The song and melodies are boring. If you are looking for great groups from the late sixties in San Francisco, you should look for ""Quicksilver Messenger Service"", ""Jefferson Airplane"" or HP Lovecraft. Don't waste your time with Country Joe and the Fish."
2,Netgear Skype Dual Phone,I'm satisfied with the voice quality of the product but the looks is not that good. I hope they can design better than this just like apple does. CHeap looking plastic. Netgear should have a good designer before they release a product.
1,Avoid it -- Many Problems,"At first I thought I'd like this phone, but in practical day to day use it quickly became a disappointment. Specifically, there are issues with the phone reliably connecting to Skype and doing even simple things like playing voicemail messages (it now plays them for us but we can't hear anything, from either of two handsets). In addition, it has been disconnecting and reconnecting from Skype continuously which is highly disruptive.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention. When you're on a call, and another call comes in, it beeps in your ear and EVEN WHEN YOU REJECT THE OTHER CALL, IT STILL BEEPS ENDLESSLY, FORCING YOU TO ABANDON YOUR CURRENT CALL TO MAKE THE BEEPING STOP. Totally annoying, and makes the phone useless.A very poor, immature, 1.0 product. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,Great phone,"I was a little apprehensive of giving up my vonage service to switch to skype, but I have to say that this phone has made all the difference. The calls are crystal clear, no drop-outs, and the system is very easy to use -- even for a skype novice such as myself. I'm also very pleased with the phone asthetics -- very good design. I also like the fact that the phone takes standard nimh rechargeable batteries. This phone is a winner."
5,Excellent product - just get skype plan for $30 a year unlimited US CANADA,I would start from bottom line. Excellent product - just get skype plan for $30 a year unlimited US CANADA and get rid of all phones in home (except may be yr cell phones...). you need skype IN if you want real phone number though. YOU DO NOT NEED COMPUTER RUNNING TO PLACE AND RECEIVE CALLS.1. very easy to install. Just hook up the base unit in to router and good to go.2. battery in the phone is rechargable like your digital camera. Base unit for the phone is just to charge battery.3. easy to place call and excellent skype functionalites.
4,A great Home Office line.,"I work from my home and needed a second line. I also use Skype alot to talk with associates overseas. When I heard about this phone, I thought I would try it. It has been working out quite well.It plugs right into my router and works fairly reliably. (It occasionally resets and loses connection.) Associates can call and I no longer need to fumble for my headset. The computer doesn't have to stay on all the time.I went ahead and got a SkypeIn number. Now anyone can call me, not just Skype users. I am pleased with this."
4,Great phone so far,"Having 5 of them for 3 months now. They work like a charm. Don't try with land line. But I don't need land line anymore anyway.As the others review, it doesn't seem to sync the contact list (It did on my first phone). Updated new firmware as soon as I got them. I recommend to change default password on the box as well. Nice phone, great sound. Sometimes, people ask me to low the volume down b/c it is too loud.Batteries are kind of cheap. But I can get the good batteries at any store for cheap. People are surprised when we don't use regular phone any more. We are using unlimited SkyOut in US. Save us a ton of money for the phone. Don't try SkyIn yet. But we don't need anyway. You can add contact on the phone without turn your PC on too. Great job."
2,"Very bad echo, but setup was a breeze!","This was really easy to set up. However, on all calls made on it (whether local or overseas) there was a REALLY bad echo on our end. The people on the other end didn't hear it, but everything we or the other person said echoed so loudly that it obscured the words! So, back to the headset for now..."
3,"Very good, useful product","Pros:Good quality constructionGood rangeDecent Battery lifeEasy to setupGood voice quality- no echoes/white noiseJust works!Cons:Can get stuck in ""Starting"" when turning on, sometimesNO VOLUME CONTROL!!! need the ear-piece to be a bit louder!Cant reject incoming calls when talking!"
4,All in all we're very happy w/ the purchase,"It's interesting reading all of the comments. They tend to waiver one way or the other regarding peoples over-all experience w/ the product.We are very happy with the purchase. The quality is very good most of the time (we are using the phone via cable modem), sometimes people claim that I sound 'slightly' muffled. I imagine that's when the network is congested. SkypeOut & SkypIn work like a charm. The biggest complaint that I have is the quality of construction.The phone itself seams cheaply made...ie not very durable. If your toddler gets a hold of this thing good luck."
5,Very Impressed with Netgear SPH 200D,"I have one Huge complaint about this phone...everytime I buy one and travel overseas, I end up giving it away to someone because they fall in love with it. 2 in the last month. I am now purchasing 3 more. One for Mom, Dad and hopefully one for me (If I don't end up giving it away as well).Simple to use and install!The only trouble I ever have is that it occasionally doesn't connect to the network. The simple way to fix that is unplugging the power cord from the base station for 10 seconds and then pluging it back in and I am back in business.I have a Skypein number and people call me at a local TX number when I am actually on a different continent. I just gave the last one to my buddy that lives in Shanghai and he purchased a U.S. number so that his customers in the US don't have to pay when calling him in China. I am still amazed that I can talk to people all over the world for 2-3 cents per minute.A.C.Dallas, TX"
1,Would be great if it worked,"""Unavailable"" or busy tone followed by ""Sorry call failed!"" are the most frequent responses to an attempt to call out using SkypeOut. We routinely miss incoming calls.Even just going through the menus, ""Unavailable"" is a frequent response. Maybe one out of four times can you actually get the cordless unit to do what you wish. I'm just 15 feet away from the base unit and they can't communicate.For this to pass as a telephone, it is going to have to be considerably more reliable. You pick up a phone and use it and it works. This thing just doesn't do that.It's always an adventure. Sometimes it works--mostly not. Clearly this product is not ready for wide-spread adoption.We've used Skype as our only phone for over a year and it is an exercise in daily frustration. The only land-line alternative here is a morass of totally unacceptable business practices, or we would have abandoned this product in the first week. For the price, extremely disappointing."
2,A great idea with too many shortcomings,"I really wanted to love this phone. For the equipment cost + $30 for a year of SkypeOut, it's a great value. I had to work hard to talk my wife into the purchase, but the reviewers here helped to convince her. Unfortunately, the call quality of this phone (for Skype calls) is nothing like a landline, and not even in the same league as Skype on a computer. Nobody we called even recognized our voices at first, and kept asking why it sounded like we were all muffled. The delay between speaking and being heard made carrying on a conversation difficult at best. Minor annoyances (that we could have ignored with better call quality) are the lack of outgoing caller id and an answering machine for landline calls.The phone companies are in for a rude awakening, and this phone is an early version of a device that will eventually be an excellent product ... but it's just not there yet. Mine is on its way back to Amazon."
1,One fatal flaw makes this phone useless,"As many others have pointed out, this phone does not generate usable tones to operate with phone answering systems. Therefore, it is completely useless as a replacement for your regular phone.On top of that, it has the usual issues of rather poor voice quality, long delays before each side hears the other, echos of your own voice that are so annoying that it makes it almost impossible to hold a conversation, and customer support that had to be called four times only for them to tell me that the lack of touch tones is ""under investigation"" because of other users' complaints.In other words, this phone will make you very unhappy if you expect it to act like a normal telephone."
2,can you hear me now?,"this is a nice product and i bought it because it had so many good reviews - turns out i should have trusted the few bad reviews i read instead.sure it's a dandy little device that feels good in my hand and as promised i'm no longer ""tied"" to my computer - though i practically have to sit right on it with my ear glued to the phone to decipher even half of what my friend is telling me.i make only non paid Skype calls overseas [not SkypeIn/SkypeOut] so that may be the difference, but even with all the fixes i've read and tried, the voice quality on this phone has never come close to the quality i got with a simple $5 labtec headphone/microphone combo.you do the math - meanwhile this product will be returned so i can buy a big comfy computer chair. heck, there might even be enough money left over to upgrade to a pair of $10 headphones... ;)"
3,Ok but not complete,"This book is ok if you want to learn playing keyboard with built-in auto-accompaniments. The lessons are almost exclusively on playing melody lines with basic chords (so you can play the auto backing). If you want to expand your playing, you would eventually want to learn proper left hand rhythm techniques rather than using 'single finger chords' found in electronic keyboards. This book doesnt cover techniques for different rhythm genres (i.e. blues, rock, pop, country etc). So it isnt really that complete."
4,good recopilation!..,"There are pretty good mixes in this cd; I specially like track 4,5 and if you like mondo grosso, you can't find the mix of Vibe PM in other cd, so this is another must have cd from dimitri.."
4,I would give it 4.5 actually..,its pretty good. Better than most of the cds i have. I especially like that the tracks are pretty varied.. The best track is the last one because its a bjork remix.. and bjork is magical.
3,classic old school mobile audio bass mix,"This is a decent compilation of some older names in the bass scene. It is a great cd for breaking in a nice set of subs, and it'll definitely let you find the weak links in your audio system. If you like to have your stereo heard 6 blocks away, this cd can definitely help!"
3,Mountain Reconstruction,"Price takes you back to the hills of North Carolina to the Reconstruction period of the Civil War. Here the people must face the evils of reconstruction. They have to find the means of survival, good or bad. Price certainly has some very unique characters in his story that keeps you turning the page. It makes you wonder if they were the real McCoy. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
4,Great purchase!,I'm really glad I got this book. I needed to buy the 4th edition for a class but after doing some research I found that the 3rd was extremely similar if not identical to the 4th. I saved a lot of money and I'm doing great in the class!
3,It's a little dense,"It has a lot of good information but it is very crammed packed with it. My professor points out what we need to know after we have read, otherwise I might not know what to focus on."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"Well, to say I'm underwhelmed by this product is an extreme understatement. I work for an organization with many children and many crayons. My response is - throw this product in the trash! I'm fairly light handed, but found that every 3/4 crayons I had to take the blade out and clear the broken crayon. What a waste of time and money. I can't believe other reviewers found this to be a good product."
1,Not worth the money!,I bought this about three months ago and it is the WORST thing I ever bought. When I first seen this I was thrilled. I own a day care and spend lots of time sharpening crayons. At first with a new blade it worked fine but who wants to change the blade all the time and blades are expensive too. Now this is not worth anything to me and just makes sharpening crayons a bigger job then before. You spend more time trying to get the broken crayon out that got stuck. If you have any kind of arthritis in your fingers/hands you can totally forget about using it as you have to have a VERY firm grip on the crayon to keep it from spinning in the sharpener. Whoever said a child can do it is wrong. I have let all age children try and its always with the same results. I only wish I would have listened to the other reviews. I also can't believe other reviewers found this to be a good product. DO NOT BUY THIS! I just wish I could send it back.
3,A little diffucult to use.,May be diffucult for a youngster to use. The paper wrapper on the crayon must be torn off at least 1 inch for the sharpensr to work properly. Leaving too much paper on the crayon can jam the sharpener snd necessatate clearing before using.John
5,THE VERY BEST!!!!!,"In the digital era of music this is all you need and it does not break the bank. Whether you are a pro or novice this is the one to get. It has a sweet looping feature, it plays any type of cd. The platter is smooth but at the same time controllable. This is a must buy! Don't bother with any other brands Pioneer is the very best!"
5,Beautiful Teapots By Disney,"Disney made several Beautiful Affordable Teapots & this is one of the Series. It is for Decorative Purposes Only, but Makes a Nice Statement. It woulld look great on a Little Girls Dresser or even a Kitchen or Dining Room. It has a High Sheen & is Very Shiny. It's also Great For a Teapot Collector."
5,"Fare thee well, Cisco","My first exposure to folk music was listening to the popular groups like the Kingston Trio on the radio. By a complete fluke I acquired Tom Paxton's first LP and was amazed. While it included some of Tom's most memorable works, the tribute to Cisco really moved me the most. Learning about Cisco was not as easy back in the pre-google sixties as it is now. I learned of his association with Woody and found this LP.I can not comment on the CD version. I hope it includes the wonderful notes on the back of my LP. The voice and guitar work of Cisco are awesome as is the work of Eric Weisberg backing on banjo, mandolin and fiddle. Forty odd years later this work sounds as fresh as ever. This recording is a must for any fan of quality folk music."
5,"A Wonderful, Wonderful Album of Great Songs Beautifully Sung","I agree with Mr. Adams in that this is a great album. I've been playing it constantly for about 41 years now, I'd say, and have just finished transfering the songs from the CD onto my computer so that I can listen to them in my den.I do disagree with him strongly about one thing, though: I can't *stand* to listen to any Guthrie singing his own songs, either Woodie or the son. I'm afraid that my ear is more attuned to the Kingston Trio or Weavers sort of sound, so that if I could only have these songs sung by Woodie himself I'd never listen to them.Just the way I can't stand Bob Dylan songs unless they're sung by Joan Baez. Call me eccentric....But Cisco Houston truly has a wonderful voice -- get this album!"
5,They just keep getting better!,this CD is a great example of where Mexican alt/pop rock is going. Once you've played it a few times you just can't stop! Even my non-spanish speaking friends like it.
2,Little new stuff,"I have had a book on this subject by Max Cade and also ""Beyond Biofeedback"" for many years. This book does not seem to add anything significant for me. But it may probably be helpful for those intending to use biofeedback in therapy."
2,saint tail girl of justice,I think it is very hard to read the words and look at the movie but some times it can help you learn to speak japanese.i will not buy till you make it in English.
1,"no dubbing, no buying","Well, this is the last installment of Saint Tail I will be buying. My young children can't follow the subtitles."
4,Good looking compass,"Looks really good once installed. Simple enough to wire, and seems to work. I'm not navigating the open ocean so I don’t need anything special, just something to keep me orientated when fishing late at night.Not sure why, but they made it about 1/32"" smaller than the typical dash gauge so it’s a bit loose in the hole. There is however a rubber gasket that seems to take up the difference. Finding the right since cut-out saw might be tricky"
4,Not a bad Anime,"Not too bad. I really like this movie, it's an excellent sci-fi Anime. It had some pretty cool background music too (Sensation, ooh baby! Err.. Ahem...sorry). It had scientific application that was actually plausable, and actually some thing I've been thinking about recently, just before I bought it, like transmit energy and St. Elmo's fire etc. It was realistic in it's gadgetry, but there was kind of a plot deffeciency, and not much character developement. There was obvious romantic opportunity between Sarah and Akira, the main characters. Aside from that and some other flaws (the same animation sequence every time they use the gravity control system, etc.) it was a pretty good Anime."
2,"Some good music, but misleading","While this Cd has some undeniably great music from Buddy's stint with Vanguard records, as a whole, it reeks of rip-off. For a start, the shoddy packaging offers no information whatsoever beyond the song titles. Novices unfamiliar with Buddy might not be aware that a good chunk of the tracks feature the vocals and harp of the late Junior Wells, or that the material is entirely available on other, better, releases by Buddy and/or Junior on Vanguard. Fans of Buddy will likely already have those, and beginners are strongly advised to start somewhere else, such as Buddy's classic ""A Man and the Blues"" album, possibly one of the greatest albums ever, blues or otherwise."
4,Good companion piece to The Hidden Writer,"A well-written book on the rich rewards of keeping a journal. Full of luminous personal anecdotes. It is intended for the somewhat experienced journal-keeper so it doesn't detail all the various types you can keep, nor does it assign you basic writing exercises. Instead it gets into the psychology of journal-writing, and examines fascinating topics like tracing long-term patterns through your life and shaping material from your journals into memoir. The author alludes to some of the rich material she covered in The Hidden Writer, but only slightly. This is a good companion to The Hidden Writer."
4,What to do with your journals...,"I am an avid journaler, and this book was a delight to read. It wouldn't be a book for a beginner, however. Only the first few chapters really talk about how to journal. The rest of the book is more about how to ""harvest"" your journals and what to do with them to turn them into other creative writing, seeing patterns and writing about those, etc.The book has some excellent quotes. Here's a good one: ""To keep a journal is to know the present is still under consideration, merely a first draft of your experience."" So there's some food for thought - and pen!My favorite books on journaling are ""Journal Keeping"" by Luann Budd and ""How to Keep a Spiritual Journal"" by Ron Klug."
4,MARV LOGAN DEAD,"This November, l967, mass market paperback was originally published in hardcover by Jefferson House in 1955. I have no count of how many Powder Valley westerns there are but I have close to three dozen on my shelves.This book finds main characters Pat Stevens and pals Sam and Ezra rushing to aid Marv Logan, only to find that Marv is already dead. Brent, Marv's son, blames the 'accident' on Frank Fancher and Fancher's handsome daughter, Haila. Frank and Haila own the Yellow Plume mine and they accuse Brent of ""...obstructing mining operations."". What with a payroll robbery, an explosion at the mine, and several deaths, it looks as though our heroes, Pat, Ezra, and Sam have their work cut out for them.Another great tradition western read from the mind and pen of Peter Field. Read one tonight. Best, pards.Semper Fi."
1,"Do not buy it, please!","This item is relatively low price and so it comes with low expectations, however, the actual product was way below I was expecting. This item is a total waste of money, not only the colors on the advertised picture are totally different, but the cast iron is very low quality. Mine came in broken, the hinge that supports the lid is very weak and can break easily after the first couple of uses if u are lucky enough to receive this item in good condition. The wooden drawer is poorly finished and thus very loose; if you dare to grind coffee be sure it will spill all over the place.It is truly sad that Amazon allows this kind of products on their site."
1,Poor workmanship and Packaging,Poor workmanship and poor packaging led to a scared base and screws that won't hold down the grinder. I do NOT recommend buying this item.
3,coffee grinder,"I did get fast service, the price was ok, but lid was broken off, but, it looks nice for decoration."
1,Don't purchase this Grinder,"I received the grinder in two pieces--while the grinder has a wooden base, it wasn't attached and I only had holes where the screws attaching the base were supposed to be. In addition, there was a strange odor coming from the grinder. Needless to say, I'm going to buy another brand and spend a little more."
4,like side handle,I like the side handle for grinding but the process is slow and the entire unit on the small side. The price is right though and the grind is fine to course as stated.
2,Smells Bad,The grinder works ok but has a terrible odor that seems to be comming from the catch drawer.This odor is present in the brewed coffee. It must be some species of wood from China. I also had loose screws securing the base.
3,sturdy but tough to adjust,"This multi-use grinder is sturdy and attractive but tough to adjust.It's easy to use to mash up seeds and nuts, but hard to get the rightsetting for coffee. I need to switch between grind size for French Press,Drip, and espresso. This just doesn't do it. I can't get a fine grind forthe espresso."
3,Not for espresso,"My machine was not assembled with much care and like some of the other reviews the hinge for the top was broken. I took my machine apart and did some sharpening to the ""burrs"" with a fine tooth file. The burrs in this grinder are cast and not machined, so the grinding effect is really caused by crushing whatever is fed thru. I also filed down the casting on one of the sides to improve the fit and make things go back together tighter and better. This resulted in a grinder that runs smoothly and has a fair bit of heft. I ground off the broken hinge and just use the palm of my hand to cover the top.As others have said, this grinder would be all right for coarse ground coffee. I use it to grind dry beans and rice to make my own furrina style dishes. I'm sure it would also do well for various woody seeds and herbs. I like it and I'm keeping mine. It won't do an espresso grind."
4,Great bag glove,"I bought the 10 oz. size. At first I was worried that it may not fit well since my hands are a bit small, but when I got them the fit was no problem. The leather is durable, and the padding is perfect for my purposes - training on the bag and with focus mitts. The wristrap holds the glove very securely. I love the bright color (I bought yellow!) as well.The only downside for me is I wish they were a bit more flexible, which is why I gave this glove 4 rather than 5 stars."
5,The Way Alternative Should Be,"In short, this disc is everything that alternative rock should have been for the last 8 years. With immense lyrical skill, fantastic musical talent, and solid songwriting, this is one of the albums that will usher in a well needed change in popular music. They have been compared favorably to the Foo Fighters, but their sound is beyond comparison. If you cringe at the thought of another Limp Bizkit album, and groups like Nickelback and Puddle of Mudd make your head spin, buy this CD. You'll be glad you did. Every song is fantastic."
5,Excellent Album,"Finelines is a highly emotional, ethereal yet violent, burst of artistic creativity. Don't trust the official Amazon review, which says that Finelines is basically a ""pretty good debut album"". Honestly, My Vitriol have created songs and harmonies that are extremely innovative and pleasuring. If you're sick of always hearing music that sounds the same, get this album right now! To explain what I mean by ""innovative harmonies"", maybe think of The Mars Volta. Although My Vitriol definitely sounds more like My Bloody Valentine (only much, much better!)"
4,Alternative without the stench of the 90's influence,England kept releasing bands who all sounded like Radiohead. My Vitriol is the spawn of smashing pumpkins latest/ underrated album Machina: the machines of god. My vitriol has the talent to create some of the greatest songs in the world and unfortunatly not many will want to listen because they have to listen to garbage records from ludacris and eminem.
2,Pretty standard really.,"The best phrase to describe this disc and those like it is,""Run of the mill."" Although not BAD, FINELINES is lacking something in energy and an original concept. The only real highlight is the song GROUNDED, which is still not anything too special. In this day and age where almost every rock record that is easy to get your hands on sounds like the last, bands like MY VITRIOL should try to up the ante and put some craftsmanship into their already technically proficient act. Bring on the next, hopefully it's a little better."
3,Rufus Zuphall - 'Weis Der Teufel...' (Little Wing),"Originally released in 1969,this was the short-lived German band's first of just two albums.Very little if any info available on the CD's cheezy artwork.Wasn't able to find much information about the band except they feature the work of two decent guitarists,John Renbourn and Bert Jansch.I'd best describe this artist as maybe part progressive,part folk-inspired rock.Might,however appeal to some fans of early Jethro Tull,Groundhogs or possibly Blodwyn Pig.The German label,Funfundvierzig released a 2000 reunion disc of theirs titled 'Colder Than Hell' a litlle while back.If you can find that CD anywhere,I'd recommend it more than I would this effort.Not a bad lp,but nothing special.To the next label that reissues this title,PLEASE include the full artwork."
5,Thanks!,Item as described. Received two days after I ordered it.Smooth transaction. No complaint. Thanks!
2,Mississippi John Hurt Today,The recording level is so low on this cd that you must turn your stereo almost to full volume to hear it at all. The songs are great but I am highly disappointed in the way it was recorded!!!!
3,"Nice jeans, but run very slim","I bought these jeans for my dad, and he's the same size in everything. I bought the very same size, but this run VERY narrow in the waist AND thighs."
3,"Great Wrangler quality, but too small","My son has worn 36x36 for years in the stonewash, lighter blue but in this darker blue they appear to run about a size smaller. I was disappointed that they did not fit. I will have to return them."
4,Great Cd,"Originally I missed getting this cd somehow when it first came out, I saw it on sale at Amazon awhile back and though, this is a great time to pick up this one. I have most of the other Bass Mekanik cd's, I had heard this one before and really wanted to get it too. It is a good and hard hitting as I remembered, I wish I had picked it up years ago."
4,great color choice,"i really wanted to choose a unisex fabric. this pattern is great and very modern and stylish. i was amazed by the shipping time, i literally had the item next business day, a full five days before the amazon expected shipping date. this item comes with easy instructions and contact information to the supplier. i highly recommend this manufacturer. my son loves sitting on my hip and this item really gives me the confidence to be hands free. it is so much easier to use then the typical front carriers."
4,part,Received as described. Haven't used it yet but the lack of knowledge locally as to what this is or was or ability to even purchase it locally astonishes me. Thank goodness for Amazon and the internet. Hey local vendors you ought to pay attention why we shop the internet..no attitude..great prices and availability of what we want! Not what you are trying to sell..or can't even get.
3,locknut socket,I used the tool for the first time and broke the studs I had to redo the studs with solid hardened steel then it worked fine
5,Great,We like the turtles and we received it in 2 days and in great condition and for a great price. That's all Great shows
2,Not so great...,"I cringe every time I open it. Not the worst text I've ever encountered, but far far from the best. (It apparently offers some good stuff, though. If you manage to get through it.)"
2,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome","This is Jaguares 3rd album and upon hearing it the first time I thought what a great album. After hearing it the second time I am of the opinion that this is the Jaguares best album to date, simply a masterpiece of lyric and music. If you liked their previous albums and Caifanes there is no doubt in my mind that you will like this album. BUY THIS CD!!!"
5,Just amazing....un album increible...,"I do not have enough words to say how good this album is. Jaguares es the ONLY spanish ROCK band that is putting out real rock. There are too many ""nu-metal"" bands out there and to be honest, this mixture of rock and rap ... big time. Hopefully the new spanish bands will notice that it is possible to survive (dollars) doing good rock like Jaguares does.I love the sound of ""Cuando la sangre galopa"", its a mixture of Led Zep, Cure, Caifanes, latin(folk & rhythm), U2, Metallica, Pink Floyd (a little trippy). The final piece is just incredible. PLEASE PLEASE we need new GOOD bands... From the three greatest spanish rock bands - Jaguares is the only one alive (RIP Soda Stereo and Heroes del Silencio).Jaguares esta mas vivo que nunca..."
5,Un discazo!,"Un disco excelente, es un reencuentro con el sonido jaguar que se perdió un poco con ""Bajo el azul de tu misterio"". La guitarra del Vampiro López cada día se escucha mejor y en este disco introduce sonidos y texturas muy ricas. ""La vida no es igual"" es un nuevo clásico en la era Caifanes-Jaguares, o sea, es una pieza de colección. ""Como tú"" -el primer sencillo-, es el sonido clásico de Saúl y es una buena canción. Una de mis favoritas es ""El ültimo planeta"", un tema con guitarras pesadas y una cadencia riquísima. Además, tiene instrumentaciones muy elaboradas y cada uno de los integrantes del grupo suena genial. Si no tiene el disco, se está perdiendo de un discazo, y si aún no es fan de Jaguares, este es el momento de hacerlo"
4,Wine not from this world!,This book is very good by a very good author. It talks about his experiences of how he came to Christ and the ups and downs of beginning his ministry.
5,A wonderful exploration of pop-like music,"This cd is perhaps the most calming and excellent piece of pop music I have ever heard.Every song on the cd is fairly emotionally charged, but light as far as the rhythm and volume. It's great to listen to if you're interested in deep lyrics and meaning above speed or simple loud, catchy tunes (not that there's anything wrong with loud, catchy tunes.)Everything on this cd seems like it's a venture into the unknown, and out of all the music I've heard, nothing is quite the same as this. It's not different in a bad way, not at all, it's different in a profoundly good way. If emotion, witty lyrics, and calm pop are your thing, you can't go qrong with this piece of music."
4,"try not to sing along, I dare you.","This is a great album. I would say it sounds like Guided by Voices covering Sebadoh songs(smash your head on the punk rock era)add just a dash of Palace/Will Oldham and then BAM! Kick it up a notch.The more you listen to this album, the more you love this album. Buy 10 CD's and give them out to all your friends."
1,Only recommended if you are migrating from C++ to JAVA,"In my opinion, there are 2 major flaws with this book: - it is intended for C++ programmers moving to JAVA (which I'm not) & the organisation of the content lacks structure. Of the 5 JAVA books I have read this is close to the weakest, which is a shame as the author tries to cover ground which other books don't do e.g. UML, design patterns, SQL. The author definitely has excellent knowledge of the material but it is presented in a confusing style - poor layout and too much waffle and irrelevant information. If you want a pure JAVA book or have no knowledge of C++ development, try something else."
4,Good book to learn Java programming.,"Very similar in contents to Bruce Eckel's, Thinking in Java book with graphical illustrations, added in."
2,Very disappointing,"I recently stumbled across Dave Duncan's Blades books and read through them all in about 6 weeks. I loved them all, gripping tales well told. Then I bought this.... what a disappointment if you are used to the Blades books. The style of writing is totally different; the depth of characters and storyline seem very shallow. Other than the ability to imagine other worlds in detail, this seems almost to be the work of another author."
2,"Solid plot, ok characters, but no happy ending.","Good characters, with understandable problems. But I was left feeling so digusted with the society, I was hoping they would get wiped out. If I want depressing human stories I can read history books. I come to sci-fi for escapism, thought provoking social comentary hidden in a good story, and an ending I can feel good about. This book just did not deliver."
1,Not for Creative Zen,"I wrote e'mail to OEM and got no response, so:Even though it says it's for Creative and IPod players on the Inspire website it is not. It even comes up on Amazon as compatible with Zen. They use different cables so don't waste your time."
1,Doesn't work,I tried using This by reversing cords for iPod and still did not work.I saw nothing but a blank screen.
1,Waste of money,I got this in the mail today with hopes of watching a movie on my tv but I don't get any picture on my screen! I really feel as though I have been played a fool by this company and suggest that you just buy cables made directly by your mp3 player manifacturer.
5,Good Product,Very good price. The only semi-bad thing is that shipping was around two to three times more than the product costed. But it was well worth it.
4,Diesel Truck Jumper cables,The quality of workmanship and materials is outstanding on these cables. If you own a crew cab pickup - especially a diesel pickup - these are the cables you need.
5,incredible quality,I was amazed at exactly how high the quality of these jumper cables were. The parrot grip in extremely powerful and I have no problems reaching anybody now that I have a 25' cable. The 2 gauge wire ensures that I can handle any situation.
3,'Bitchin',"Probably one of the more creative and unique bass groups out there. Like most bass groups, the flaw of this album is that most of the tracks are too repetitive. But several (e.g., LIQUID BASS) are really awesome and 'cool beyond pickles.' For the several 'bitchin' tracks alone, this CD is probably worth buying, but at 14 dollars is quite pricey..."
4,Very weird and cool.,"Bass Waves-Liquid Bass is hands-down the best bass album that I've ever come across and I've sampled dozens of bass albums from different artists -from Techno Bass Crew to Eurobass Express to Bass 305, etc.The music -atypical of other bass songs that came out in the mid '90s- (by the way, what ever happened to mid '90s era of bass music? It faded away as simply as it appeared.) is purely instrumental and electronic -replete with deep, low frequency electronic bass tones that actually can damage speakers and subwoofers, especially if the volume is too high. The songs are very diverse from each other, both melody-wise and in terms of beats; -they're generally slower and more atmospheric than bass music from similar artists- but very creative.If you're a stickler for bass music (though it's probably not considered ""au courant"" anymore these days, but rather quasi-antiquated) I highly recommend Liquid Bass over any other bass album."
4,Great indeed,"The only part of this album that I don't think is great, are the vocals. Other than that, I would have probably given this a 5 star rating. I'm not too strict about the vocals in music though, so I still enjoy them. This album is great. Get it. And vote for me, George W. Bush."
2,i know many will probably disagree but...,"i find this cd to be extremely boring. ive heard this cd before, and by that i mean that 100 hardcore bands beforehand have done the melodic guitars throughout the cd. i popped this cd into my player and was expecting to get floored with pounding riffs i get boring melodic guitars, dont get me wrong i love melodic guitars but they get extremely boring once you hear them in EVERY song through the WHOLE song. not to mention that the vocalist isnt the greatest screamer out there, he gets annoying fast as well. plus there are random whispered or softly spoken lyrics througout the cd that just push me even more to turn this cd in....i strongly suggest you get a good listen before you pick this one up. you might like it you might not, and i know that a lot of people are probably going to be biting my head off, but hey everyone has an opinion."
1,For A Much Better Choice,"I'm sure the author is a good guy with a big heart, but unfortunately this book is incredibly weak. It's very dated and in desparate need of editing (at one point the author says something about being philosophically against rewriting/editing--and man does it show). I assume consistent plugs by the Whole Earth Catalog and the Whole Earth Review got this book its notoriety, but it's hard to imagine how it has maintained its counterculture mini-classic status. Probably because for years it was the only alternative money book around (and it does have a great title). For much better financial advice and infinitely better writing, check out The Mindful Money Guide. It's wise, witty, and covers all matters financial--always with an eye to quality of life. (The book even has a section titled The Cosmic Laws of Money.)"
4,Interesting and Uplifting Read Although Old,"The Seven Laws of Money was written in the 1970's.Nonetheless, it is a one-of-a-kind read for those who want inspiration and confidenceto succeed.The book is written in an easy-to-read format and a manner that can make you laugh.The book could help inspire teenagers in recovery from drug dependency gain confidence."
1,Personal ramblings without a point,"I thought this book would be a little ""gem"" but it turned out to be a little ""stinker"". The writing is bush league, dated and without meaningful content - mere personal ramblings seemingly more intent on impressing the reader with personalities he ( the author ) has know. The ideas ( laws? ) are obvious yet made abstact by their presentation. I may be missing something here as I see 5 star reviews. Then again, I may not be smoking the right stuff!"
3,Note this does not have force feedback.,"Overall it was OK, but this wheel does not have force feedback. I wasn't sure if ""vibration feedback"" was the same...it's not. There is no power plug in...just USB."
1,Disapointed,"Found the unit does not work with most car racing games, particularly the need for speed series which my son loves.Set up is awkward and not user friendly."
4,nice product but how do you use it?,"Dear Seller,The price was good,The product was good,Your delivery was excellent!But it did not come with even a sample of what it can do!So what now? I plugged it into my computer, and everything loaded as it usually does, but no games, not even a starter edition.pardon my ignorance, but even when I registered with Logitech, there was no reference to an actual usuable and downloadable game for this device.Confused new gamer ( I bought this for my five year old, who is as mystifyed as I am).This product is NOT a recommend for the novice, such as myself.Just go out and buy a complete system that has all the bits and pieces included....save time and disappointment."
3,"works, but...","spent forever and a day trying to figure out why this didn't work in any games, then by chance unplugged other logitech controllers (joystick, game pad) and then the games recognized it just fine. I don't understand why this is, since the other controllers were made by logitech too and they all use the same profiler software. Irritating for sure, but not surprising coming from logitech."
5,100% Juice - JU ice,JU ice is one of the best known battle rappers!! This compilation album is of his best earliest work!! This is real Hip Hop!! Quality of recording is not great but its what makes this a classic!
1,Displeased!,"As my review title states, I was very displeased with this book personally. Not that Bo Derek isin't a great person with an interesting, complex life, but from the title of the book, I was expecting it to be more horse related. As a horsey krazy woman, I am drawn to any horsey book I can get my hands on, but this book wasn't what I was expecting. If you're looking to read about riding lessons of learning life lessons from horses (as the title implies), do not buy this book. However, if you just want to know more about Bo Derek as a person, then I suppose it's interesting."
3,Horse Tale,I was a little disappointed in the title after I had read the book...hoping it would be more about how horses affected her life. I was left with the sad impression that she is a little more shallow than I believed. The stories don't lead to any deep revelations...they leave you hanging. I hope she is more colorful than these stories portray her to be.
2,Piece of celebrity fluff,"""Riding Lessons"" is not worth the time to read. Look at the pictures, if you wish, but read something else. Ms. Derek certainly looks good on a horse, but her writing skills wouldn't earn her a passing grade in high school. Disjointed, self-centered and immature, ""Riding Lessons"" appears to have been written by a giddy, clueless teenager. I gave it two stars because it does have a section of color photographs, otherwise, it would be a ""one""."
2,Disappointing,"I really expected more from this book. I do admit I purchased it at a used book sale, 8 years after it was published. I was very disappointed in the fact Bo didn't go into much about John. As another reviewer mentioned she didn't go into why she loved him, or what she loved about him or mention much of their life together. He seemed to be a footnote in her life. They seemed to be broke much of the time, I'm not sure why they couldn't manage money better. I hate to say this but she came across as just dumb or uneducated in the book. She didn't seem to have much love or passion for anything in her life but horses. I wish her well."
3,Enjoyable but not enough about horses!!!,"This book is a fun, quick read. The quotes at the start of each chapter are very good. I had hoped for more from Bo on her insights re: horses."
4,Check the necklace!,"A very nice looking and good quality piece of silver jewelry. Better be sure to check the glue at the ends of the strand. Mine came loose after 2 hours on one end. The black cord ends are glued into silver caps and one was loose. Other than this minor defect, it is perfect!"
4,simple and pretty,I liked this necklace. The black cord and the silver heart look very clean and simple. Only wished that it was a couple inches longer.
2,pretzel heart,"It was a great gift, it is nice that it is sterling silver and all. However the black cord slipped out of the clasps and thus the necklace is broken. So I have to buy another black cord for the necklace this frustrates me."
3,"Pretty, but not perfect...","This necklace does look in reality as it appears on the screen, which is a good (and unfortunately not common enough) thing when ordering something online. My complaint is that it tends not to lie flat (maybe the pendant is too light? Or the cord is too flimsy?). The slightest movement of my body causes one side or the other to rise up. Maybe my body is too wavy."
1,Busted!,"I was so disappointed when I received this Gospel Video. I opened the package and the cover was busted with holes all over it. I started watching the videos and it just froze half way through. So, it's on the way back to the distributor for a refund."
4,Great item,"Touch and feel are great; also now much easier to clean. Any which way you look at it, a vast improvement on the older models. I only wish folks could find a way to make such things truly rechargeable."
4,Small but mighty,"Despite the diminutive size (in all dimensions) of the keyboard, the keys are well spaced and give positive feedback. The keyboard is also very sturdy and doesn't bounce at all as you are typing. The small size and light weight of the keyboard makes it very easy to put aside or move to where you want it to be. I just got my keyboard the other day, but my wife has had one for about 6 months now and I've been amazed at how long the batteries have gone before needing to be replaced. My only complaint with the keyboard is that there is no numeric keypad."
4,Compact keyboard great for occasional use.,"I bought this for a Mac mini hooked up to my TV. Its very small, compact and rigid and works great for the limited use I have. Set up was a breeze and it always works quickly and perfectly for 15-20 feet away. I don't think I would want this for a keyboard that I used for a lot of text entry. The chicklet style keys aren't great for tactile feedback and it seems easy to misplace your hands. I'm not sure exactly why. However, for the limited use I bought it for, it works perfectly."
1,A pretty but worthless toy!,"This is a very pretty little keyboard. I have had mine for quite awhile now. I hate it!The arrow keys, which I use often, are awkwardly placed. Other useful keys are missing entirely. The keyboard has such a low profile, that I have to place a 1/2 inch thick book under it, if I want to type with any kind of speed!I'm here today to buy a real keyboard!"
1,Over hyped,"Apple Wireless Keyboard KitA big disappointment. First, the keyboard will only work with one computer at a time. Nor does Mac make drivers for a PC, and Microsoft does not make a driver for this keyboard. I was informally told that Microsoft's generic bluetooth keyboard drivers will work with Windows XP2d and up. But my PC's OS was older. Unfortunately, Apple doesn't bother to spell out their product's limitation until after you've bought it; instead they concentrate on hype and pretty pictures. Apple has spent it's time and engineering expertise on looks instead of utility. Consequently, I was conned into the purchase of a beautiful, yet useless paper weight when what I wanted was a just a simple keyboard to use with both a Mac and a PC."
5,Beautiful and improved my typing accuracy,"I can't believe how great this keyboard is. When I saw my husband's, which he had purchased along with his new iMac, I had an oddly visceral reaction to it and raved about the design for several minutes. I've had my own for about a month now. It's slim, it's beautiful, it's easy to clean -- and the low profile of its keys has increased my typing accuracy. (I was using one of the older clear/white Apple keyboards, which now feels hopelessly clumsy.) I am a usability specialist by trade and I can't see what one of the other reviewers is complaining about -- I have experienced absolutely no usability problems with this keyboard.I keep thinking how odd it is that I had such a strong reaction to a keyboard. I lusted after it even more than I did an iPhone. But I'm happy to say that it's every bit as nice as I thought it would be."
3,Eh. Guess I'll Live.,"This keyboard is a very compact and a nice-looking device. Very easy setup - I was connected and ready to go in no time. No lags at all, and it's nice that a simple touch of a key wakes the computer right up.It's definitely annoying that there's no number pad, Home, End, etc. keys. Doubly annoying is the lack of a designated delete key. Some say that ""function + delete"" will do the trick, but on mine that isn't the case. Finally, if you love the sleek feel and responsiveness of any of the Mac laptop keys, you might take issue with the feel of the keys on this keyboard. There's a very hollow feel to the keys and the device, in general, which also makes for a noisy experience if you're at a desk.All in all, it's been an ""eh"" for me. I could take it or leave it."
5,Great keyboard design,"Incredibly compact, easy to setup and solidly built.I use this keyboard with my MacBook and it's great. It has the most ""solid"" feel of any keyboard I've ever used and the very short stroke (keypress depth) makes typing fast easier. Just a great product.Only two minor issues: the white keys are obviously going to get dirty faster than my laptop's black keyboard (I wish there was a black version of this keyboard) and they changed the order of the special function keys from the Macbook (plus eliminated a few like being able to use the F8 key for the Spaces utility.)"
5,perfect with my ipad,"I absolutely love my keyboard. It never gets dirty, and I tote it everywhere, just tossed (with love and care) into my bag. Got it in June, use it almost daily and haven't had to change the batteries once (mid-December now).Highly, highly recommend this. I have friends with other Bluetooth keyboards, and they don't compare -- they're cheap, rattly, clunky things. This has true Mac style, built to last, worth the extra money."
2,too small for large hands,"This keyboard is compact, a little too compact. My large hands simply cannot adapt to its miniscule nature! Enlarge it a bit and it would be great for us bigger handed folks."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I am typing this review on the new Apple Wireless BT Keyboard. I am not impressed by this keyboard. I have called Apple 3 times to get help with it. Each time I would get it to pair then it would loss connection with the Mac desktop. Finally after the 3rd call some one was able to help me get it connected. This has been the longest amount of time that it stayed connected.I would say it is cramped typing on it, but it would be a great keyboard for some one that is a traveler, but for desktop it is not worth spending the money! I will be going back to the keyboard that came with my Mac."
3,"Think this through, mini users...","First, this keyboard looks great and has a good feel. In terms of aesthetics, it cannot be beat. And that is worth something for sure - we make almost all our choices partially on aesthetics.For a Mini owner, however, this keyboard has two failures. One, which seems oft-mentioned, is the lack of a numeric keypad and other good stuff on the right. As an engineer, a numeric keypad is not optional.Secondly, I do not believe the wireless version has the USB ports. Which means that if you have a wired mouse, an iPod dock and a camera interface, something has to give. That extra USB port means more than you might think.So overall, looks good, works good, but the wired keyboard with numeric keypad and USB ports is the better bet. I would give the wired version 4 to 5 stars."
4,pretty cool,"i had no problems with it yet. only thing i run into is the keys getting stuck like if i wanna type ""r"" it'll sometimes hold it down and type ""rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"""
4,Killer looks- and Fantastic function,"Performs very well, is a beautiful design- there is not much more to say that that. I did have to replace the first one as it lost connectivity, but the second keyboard has performed with out a problem for a long time.One problem- the notes you read in the reviews are true- it will get interference from cordless phones operating on 2.4 ghz - so if you own a cordless home phone- you will have to either keep it completely away from this and other Apple wireless devices - or get a cordless phone that operates on 5.6 ghz.Other than that- this is great."
3,"Good keyboard, BUT ...","I bought the keyboard a week ago. I had no problem pairing it with the computer, and the keyboard was a pleasure to use (no keystroke delays, etc.) HOWEVER, every few days, somehow the keyboard would not be discoverable from my MacBook Pro when I would start my day, causing me to troubleshoot and add it again to the list of paired devices on the computer. Just today I spent 15 minutes in the morning doing this, when I wanted to get going with the work, so I returned the keyboard to Apple and got a wired one. This is not really Apple's fault, as the keyboard is aesthetically and functionally very pleasing, but Bluetooth is just not as reliable as a physically connected device. So, if you don't mind spending time troubleshooting every now and then, get this keyboard, otherwise get the wired keyboard, which is as much of a pleasure to use."
4,Wireless Keyboard just as advertised,"This used Apple wireless keyboard was needed to go with an older PPC G4 Mac in an office environment. Found this used item and purchased it at a reasonable price. It arrived exactly as described and is performing well, just as intended.Only problem was that it took about 3 days longer in shipping than we were told."
4,I thought it was supposed to be new,"I'm guessing I picked up an ex demo model since there was no product box and the plastic pull-tab was taken off and stuck to the previously opened plastic film. The keyboard works amazing, looks amazing and I use it with my iPad in college to I don't have to write reports/emails/amazon reviews on the touchscreen. I didn't have time to go to a store before I left the US last month and so got this online in an effort to save time. It was the same price as the apple store but like I said, no box and had been opened"
5,Apple Wireless Keyboard Kit is improved technology.,I purchased the Apple Wireless Keyboard Kit because I needed a new keyboard to go with my IMac computer. It is a newer version and not as large as the older keyboards. I wasn't sure I would like it at first but I love it. It does not have the added ten key pad so you have to use the numbers at the top of the keyboard. I am a writer so this does not bother me. The size of the keys haven't changed. It takes up less space and is sleek and very updated. I highly recommend this keyboard. It is very efficient and works great with my IMac.
2,Unified field theory of sovereign genealogy,"Element presents a generously, profusely illustrated edition of the last word in chivalric and sovereign genealogy. Did you know that there is a Jacobite pretender to the English throne, who claims his birthright through descent from Bonnie Prince Charlie, King Arthur, Jesus and David? Do you agree that bloodline descent is the key to legitimate authority, more important than the consent of the governed, the consensus of the smoke-filled rooms, or even divine benediction? Then this is the book for you. A more thorough case will never be made for the divine rite of kings."
4,I found this book to be a real mind opening text.,"I found this book to be one of the most eye opening, thought prevoking texts I have read in a very long time. It was so captivating that it has caused me to want to read more, on every aspect of the history it presents. It raises so many questions as to what more I can find to support what has been written. I am now on a quest to find out what can be found to support or refute what Mr. Gardner has written. You will not be able to put this book down, once you pick it up. What a wonderful link of historical events to see unfold before your very eyes."
4,The Illustrated Bloodline of the Holy Grail,"After reading many books of similar nature, this one is very enjoyable and readable. Beautifully illustrated, however, barely related to subjects. As to the factuality of content, you have to go by your own gut feeling; not much of it is substanciated. Still I recommend it as a very interesting idea, it makes you think."
4,Well worth reading !,"A thorough attack on the popular interpreation of the old and new testaments as well as the gospels. It certainly gives rise to considerable thought why the christian churches have failed to adopt a more critical approach towards history - and the contents of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The author conceals the purpose of the book carefully until the last 30 odd pages, when he tries to demonstrate that the Royal House of Stuart descends directly - from guess who ? Nevertheless, a ""must-read"" and well written."
1,Needs primary sources!!!,"I'm not going to spend much time here. The premise of the book has already been discussed. What I find so disconcerting is the lack of evidence when he really needs it. I'll give an example, Mr. Gardner's knowledge of the kingship lineages of Europe is beyond question. He obviously knows, at least has a grasp, on the medieval lineages of European royalty. In fact, this part of his book is well documented and footnoted. But when he makes the claim that Jesus had sons and that he even knows their names (which he then gives) the footnotes mysteriously dry up. Any intelligent reader understands that his claim is what needs the footnotes and research the most! Until he can name the source that gives the names of Jesus' son, and can prove the validity of that source, this book will simply remain a doorpost to my house."
5,Can you handle it?,"Compelling information in this book can be very threatening to some. Few are willing to change their position when confronted with a new reality as profound as this. Fundamentalists would burn this book, so it must be touching on the truth!"
5,extremely informative,"This is an excellent book which makes a lot of sense.The translatians of events and meanings make more sense than anything i have ever been told in the past, which in turn makes what most people believe in a lie in effect just a story gloryfieing Jesus just as he wanted. Everyone should read this book then christianity would be turned on its head.What would happen then?."
1,Wild theories unsupported by any evidence,"This book does not deserve one star, it deserves negative stars. The book presents wild theories but fails to provide the proof to back them up. If you are looking for a book that attacks traditional Christianity just for the sake of attacking it, this book might be for you. If, however, you are looking for a reasoned evaluation of the historical record concerning Jesus Christ and the foundations of Christianity, do not even touch this book. The whole point of this book, as is proven by an examination of the end, is to support the discredited claims of a Michael LaFosse to be the heir to the Scottish throne. You have to leave your brain and your common sense behind in order to believe anything in this book."
2,Not for the faint of heart,"If you are entranced by of sympathetic to the theories of Barbara Thiering, then Gardner's Bloodline books (this one is illustrated, the other isn't) are for you. He carries the Thiering hypothesis from the time of Jesus up to the Age of Chivalry. There are many interesting aspects to this book, but the main problem is the lack of thorough documentation for many of the claims and quotations. When plowing new ground, such an error is grevious indeed. Another problem with the illustrated version is that most of the illustrations are incidental to the text. A better bargain is the non-illustrated version of the same book which is cheaper and has more information."
2,No more than a mere curiosity,"Gardner relies too heavily on one person's research for most of the first half of his book--that one person being Dr. Barbara Thiering, with whom NOT ONE OTHER SCHOLAR AGREES. In fact, if her thesis is wrong, Gardner's entire book collapses. This is his worst error. His second worst is simply his naivete. In his last chapters, he displays a completely inadequate understanding of human nature and an idealism worthy of a young Candide. If you're at all interested in the history of Jesus and early Christianity, it's worth a read, but be aware that each level of his argument becomes harder and harder to believe."
1,Not worthy of intelligent consideration,"A blatant example of misquoting Biblical refernces, picking out those that agree with the author`s ideas and ignoring those that don't. As for quoting dubious ""historical"" authors like Geoffrey of Monmouth, this really speaks for itself."
1,Okay product,"Okay product, but lots of copper in this one. I would check with a vet before admin this as a supplement to animals with certain kidney/liver issues."
5,Excellent!!!,"As a big fan of horrors I've bought a few movies of Christopher Alan Broadstone and I have to say it was really a great time, that I've spent enjoying these films. ""3 Dead Girls"" is a wonderful collection for every horror fan. :) The movies are short, but each of them has a special idea that is so original!! After watching the DVD I was really provoked to think, and I'm very excited to watch it again and again!! And all the extras are amazing. A+++"
5,Tripping The Dark Fantastic...,"Christopher Alan Broadstone's THREE DEAD GIRLS announces the arrival of a filmmaker with the dark sensibilities of a David Lynch or a David Fincher, but unlike Lynch he has a sense of narrative that is (thankfully) more linear, and he's willing to go just that one heartbeat further into darkness than Fincher has gone, even with movies like SE7EN. At times, the ambitious storytelling is sometimes hamstrung by the limited budget, but the combined effort of Broadstone and his willing muse, actor Tony Simmons, more than makes up for it. This is a great calling card, and I can't wait to see what will happen when this dark, Dynamic Duo - as potent as the teaming of Corman and Price in their heyday - will do with bigger budgets and better resources to commit more twisted visions into the human psyche to film."
2,review for no receipt,Was looking forward to viewing the film but after a very long and questioning the seller they refunded the item due to damage. My complaint is why sell something in the first place if you know it is damaged. Had I known I wouldnt have wasted my time with this seller.
2,DATED MOVIE,"MALABIMBA is considered by too many people as a classic; but I cannot understand why.The movie suggest Bimba (the main character; and adolescent of about 16 years old) is possessed; but this is not an horror movie; nor a religious one.It was probably meant as a criticism to false moral and sexual repression; a common thing in Italy between 1960 and 1970; but the message (if any, is pretty diluted).As an erotic movie; it is quite uninspired. The adding of a few seconds or hardcore porn did not improve anything.The acting however is pretty good; considering the usual cartoonish on Seventies' movies.It is only a curiosity or a collection item."
5,Cannonball Simp,"We LOVED this book when my children were small. I'm so excited to have found it, now for a grandson."
3,A box of chocolate,"I don't usually read mysteries but I enjoyed Horowitz's Alex Rider books so I thought I'd give this a try. The story takes place in England in The Falcon's Malteser. It is the story of Tim and Nick Diamond, two brothers. When Nick, the youngest brother, decides not to go to Australia with his parents, he stays with his brother Tim, who is also the worst private detective in the world. The mystery in the book is about a dwarf, named Johnny Naples, who pays Tim and Nick five-hundred dollars to watch a box of chocolate maltesers. Eventually Nick and Tim find out that the box of chocolate maltesers somehow unlock a safe with five-million dollars in diamonds."
4,The Candy Mystery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Worst detective ever, Tim Diamond has never finished any of his cases. Until he and his brother Nick get a box of candy from a dwarf. Now all the worst bad guys are after them, including the Fat Man, and his two advisors. After some close shooting accident he figures it out. But after all that hard working there was nothing there. Later he gets one diamond from the person who atually fond it. Then with the money he goes skiing, but breaks his leg and can't go. It was a little confusing at first, but then it got pretty exiting. When they knew what the mystery was the book got action packed and it was not very easy to put it down. If you are the kind of person who can take many close close aciddents.- TRAVIS."
5,"A very, very, very good book!","I think that ""The Falcon's Malteser"" was onr of the best books i have ever read. it is really funny and it is a good mystery too, and it is enjoyable for kids and adults. A very good book. I think everyone should read it!"
5,Falcon's Maltesers By. Taco,"Dear Reader,The Falcon's Maltesers is a really good book. If you like books on mystery you must read this book. The two main characters are Tim, and Nick. They are both brothers. The funny thing about it is that they are both little boys. Nick is the youngest, and the brains of the operation. Tim is the oldest, and the dumb one. This mystery keep wanting to know whats so important of a candy called Maltesers That makes every criminal in Italy after them.The more you read the more you want to know whats so important about the Maltesers.You'll be asking for more Your head will be exploding from all the action. So if you want a book to read, you should read, The falcon's Maltesers.This book is ""action packed while mysterious"". "" This book is also funny"".From, Taco"
3,A pretty good book,"Herbert Simple (aka Tim Diamond) is an ex-cop who decided to start his own private detective business. One setback for Herbert is - He is probably the dumbest dectective you could get. Luckily, his thirteen year old brother, Nick, is the real detective of the two.Jonney Naples, a dwarf who is always looking over his sholder like someone is watching him, entrusts Tim with a package and tells him not to open it or give it to anyone else. They open the package, and there is something inside that a lot of major crimanals are after. Why do they want it? While Tim fumbles along, it's up to Nick to solve this case!I thought this book was pretty good. I really liked how the mystery was so... mysterious. There was just the right amount amount of humor and seriousness to balance them out. I think anyone who likes a good mystery would like this."
5,This is a book you can't miss out on,I have just finished reading the falcons malteser. It was so good. I normally don't like reading...actually I hate it but this was an aception. You just have to read it!
3,Second Language,"I might be wrong but I don't think this author is American. His wording and thought process is a bit difficult to follow at times and I sometimes get the feeling that he is rambling.As far as proposals go, there were only 18 ideas in the book. This book is definitely ""self published"" which makes it hard to read at times with the weird spacings, etc.I was much happier with what I got at the website howtoproposemarriage. com"
2,A great outline for a book yet to be written,"This book concentrates too much on accounting at the expense of economics. It also gives short shrift to some of the most important concepts in airline finance today, including EETCs (enhanced equipment trust certificates). It's not bad when it comes to discussing the difference in national accounting systems, but a better source for that is Airline Business magazine's study ""Mind the GAAP"". Morrell's book is pretty rudimentary when it considers things like buy vs leases analyses.Airline finance can get reasonably involved, with all sorts of tax issues. This book barely scrapes the surface of the topic. Morrell is clearly not a practioner."
3,Nice CD,"This cd was right on time for some things that i needed it for, The last Poets are a group of black man that lay it down ,"
1,Don't waste your money or time in this book.,"I got this book because of the title...(""...over 70 techniques with original projects & 300 motifs). The 70 techniques are in almost any rubber stamp magazine and the projects and motifs are just HORRIBLE, I was totally shock!!!You get better ideas from free catalogs or from craft magazines. This book is a shame! I know several rubber stampers whose works are just really beatiful and they are just BEGGINERS!!!The books is full of terrible projects. the book is just a joke!"
4,Expand your horizons,"This book really helps to redefine what we consider ""The Box"". It gives you thoughts and ideas on how to expand the way you think and to give you ideas on how to be more creative. Not only was it a quick read, it was invaluable."
4,"Thar's gold here, but you gotta dig for it.","This delightful little book is full of useful tips and aha! methodology to help the reader guide groups or individuals through new approaches to organizational problem solving -- or to life. The first 20 pages or so tend to be a rehash of ideas that have been printed and discussed in many other publications. However, those who are able and willing to continue further in the book will be richly rewarded. Black's typology of creative thinking styles is especially useful in figuring out why some of us meet with blockages in our attempts to get a group to buy into our ideas."
2,Fair at best. Other books are better.,"Save your money and buy the Stuart Sutherland book ""The Verilog PLI Handbook"" ISBN 0-7923-8489-X it's much better. I have both."
4,How much do you really know?,"By far the toughest of all the review book series. Teaches the fine points and concepts of topics beyond and more thoroughly than I learned in school! Terrific if you have the time and are not easily demoralized.For comparison's sake, I averaged 66-69% on the exams in this series and in the 70-80% on the NMS exams and I got 240/95 on the USMLE and 669(99th percentile on COMLEX).Hope this helps. By the way, Kaplan questions are closest to the real thing."
4,Refresh Plus,The medication is ok but the little plastic bottles are not. I have to squeeze them many times before drops will come out. I willnot buy this brand again.
5,Freak? Not likely.... HOT maybe....,"Anstacia returns sounding better than ever! ""Paid my dues"" is an unstoppable dance track! This version includes ""Why'd you lie to me"", which til now was only available on the US version of 1999's ""Not that kind"". Another destined hit is ""One day in your life"". Check this out!"
5,the BEST new artist to hit the US in a loooong time!,"A few years ago I watched MTV's ""THE CUT"" and was impressed with Anastacia's voice, I always said to myself, that this woman would be quite succesful in the future because she has an incredible voice a powerful voice not usually heard from a white female artist except maybe Christina Aguilera and Taylor Dayne.I was watching Divas Las Vegas a few months ago and was so impressed with Ana's performance , that I eagerly awaited the US release of ""Freak Of Nature"" and I eagerly ran to the store to get it and I was so impressed!I love all of the songs on this CD, my personal favorite songs on the album are ""One Day In Your Life"" ""Overdue Goodbye"" ""I Thought I Told You That"" with my other favorite singer Faith Evans and the title track ""Freak of Nature"" is awesome!Ana has a few ballads and they are incredible, but her thing is those uptempo party jams, so if you are a fan of good music I recommend thaat you pick up ""Freak of Nature""!"
5,Anastacia is THE freak...... and she made it !!!,"I don't really know where to begin... This new opus from Anastacia is a real pleasure to listen. The powerwoman has a very beautifuk, strong and soulful voice. But not only the voice is very good, the songs are surprising too, seeing that the lady (co-)wrote them herself. The lyrics are full of emotion and sincerity, like her singing, which show all her talent. She has her own music style , (what is rare today ) and what a style !!! Personnally, i do love it. Her way to sing is not commun in the music's business, and , i must say, one of the best to transmit emotions. If u don't buy this album, it's like ignoring the best."
4,Surprisingly Good,This cd rocks! That's all I have to say. Go buy. Get it. Listen to it. I now am gonna get all of Anastacia's cds.
5,miss a.,now this is a high on love cd with many great love songs/dance songs this cd is the best cd ever i just cant wait to see what she dose next this gurl rocks go buy this cd now
3,Not bad,"SHe has a great voice and although i am more of a pop fan then r and b she is really good. Like I said if you want a dance album this is not the album for you. This is pure r and b, great songs are a day in your life, paid my dues and the song with faith evans i thought i told you that. Over all a good album for anastacia who has been slowly conquering the us after a sucess all over the world."
5,Amazing CD,"Anastacia's CD is one of the greatest CDs out there right now. This girl has an amazing vocal range. She is so different from the rest of the girl singers out there right now, and she is definatly going to be a house hold name. Her songs are so different from each other and there is never a dull moment on that CD. Definatly get this CD today!"
3,only a couple good songs,"my review will be brief.... i am a fan of dance/pop music and (hearing only a couple of her songs before buying: don't stop, i'm outta love, one day in your life) i was hoping for an album of mostly upbeat songs with some strong base, good dance drums, and her awesome voice. however! there are only really 3 songs of that type on this cd! not what i expected. I'm sure if you are into a variety of pop style songs you may enjoy this album, however if you are lookin more for dance or upbeat pop than i wouldnt spend the money on this cd... i'd get a single or two instead of her music.-L8"
4,What's with the repeated tracks???????,"Don't get me wrong. Anastacia is The Rock of pop divas. her own way. Like it or not.However I have one beef. Why in the blazes are ""Dontcha Wanna"" and ""Why's You Lie to Me"" repeated on this album? They are great songs that were on the debut. Are you telling me that Anastacia couldn't find two more songs to add to this new album? I have one track in mind that could've worked: BOOM! from the World Cup CD.Overall, pop has their own Janis Joplin with this talent. She can be around for the next 30 years and do as much as Tina Turner has for her individual sound and style.But please, make sure that a new album contains new songs. It's a slp in the face to provide anything else. geez, even a remix would've flown."
3,"Not totally my style, but she's a great artist","I bought this CD because I really liked the first single, ""Paid my dues"". I listened to it several times and now developed my favorites. Anastacia's music is not totally my style, some songs go more into country than R&B, which I am more fond of; but the texts are very good, and her performance is WOW! she has an incredible voice.Overall, a good CD. I would not give it away, but I don't know if I would buy it again."
5,A Star Is Born !!!!!!!!!!!,"I ran out and got the CD the day it was released and I have to say that Anastacia is a great singer. I first heard of her when I happened to run across ""One Day In Your Life"" on the radio and I loved it. This girl can really sing. She reminds me of Taylor Dayne but she has the Sony marketing machine behind her much like Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Destiny's Child, so she's pretty much guaranteed to be around for a while. There are several hot songs on this album, of course the standouts being ODIYL, Paid My Dues, You'll Never Stand Alone, Overdue Goodbye and How Come The World Won't Stop, which could possibly be one of the best pop songs of the new millenium, hopefully it'll get a single release. Anastacia rocks and her voice is pure emotional power, move over Britney... a new diva has arrived and this one has the talent to back up the hype."
4,Taylor Dayne revisited!,"As I have listened to Freak of Nature I could not help thinking I was listening to Taylor Dayne. It's fast, funky, driven, emotional, soulful. The only song I didn't much care for is the duet with Faith Evans. This is a rousing success of a CD! I am glad Anastacia finally has made it (back) to this side of the Atlantic."
4,A worthwhile work in progress,"I think this is a more consistent set than her debut ""Not That Kind,"" but while vocally, Anastacia has pretty much established her style, production-wise, a style hasn't yet gelled. Not as belt-heavy as her previous, either. ""One Day In Your Life"" has been remixed for the domestic release, giving it a more pop flavor than it's funkier UK version, which sounds like a re-vamping of ""I'm Outta Love,"" a song that should've been a massive hit in the US."
5,Check out what you've been missing...,"The lady who packed dance floors in 2000 with ""I'm Outta Love"" is back, and just in time! If you caught her on VH1 DIVA's Live 2002, then you already know what I'm talking about. If you didn't, do yourself a favor and BUY this album! It has something for everyone, from the uplifting ""One Day In Your Life"" to the flat out butt-kicking vibe of the title track, and the lovers out there need to check out ""I Dreamed You"". I'm already rockin' dance floors with ""Don't Stop (Doin' It)"", one listen, and you won't stop either! Want to double your pleasure? Grab a copy of her first disc - ""Not That Kind"" while you're picking up ""Freak of Nature"""
1,So bad.......,"i think that ,,one day in your life''is not bad song,so i use album,but i must go back because album is ,,the worst''!i think she have good voice,but songs are teriblle!"
4,LOVE IT!!,"Anastacia's voice so powerful & what a range!! My 3 daughters think she is the coolest, POSITIVE sounded artist they've ever heard! The lyrics to her songs are what young women need to here more about!"
3,anastacia-freak of nature,"Just released in the states Anastacia's Freak of Nature is her best cd to date. If you are an Anastacia fan I would recommend this cd very highly. Besides the extra track on the American release I would recommend the import verison of the album. On the American release they have changed alot of the music making the American release a little weak but the import version you get an entirely different vibe from the album. Also check the remixes from ""One day in your life"" and the mixes from ""Boom"", they are both now avaible..."
1,Not that kind...anymore,"Man, she's not that kind anymore. I remember i saw her for the first time on the MTV show: The Cut, and she was great! I never heard anything from her until this, and i'm fairly dissapointed. I've only listened to the songs available on this site. What happened? Where's the pizzazz? I mean, this album sounds like a flop. I suggest more dance, more attitude and better production! Geez. i feel let down. i give her 1 star for effort..."
2,Put Down The Pen!,"Anastacia has an incredibly powerful voice that is truly thrilling to listen to. What a shame that her material is so weak! With few exceptions, the songs on this album are pedestrian, cliched, 80's style pop-rock that sadly waste an incredible natural resource. The R&B leaning tracks are best, but are almost as weak. With material from stronger writers, Anastacia could make some truly landmark recordings with those incredible pipes of hers. Unfortunately, she presently fancies herself a songwriter, and that isn't where her true talent lies. ""One Day In Your Life"" is the sole exception to a generally lackluster set of songs."
3,What is this Supposed to Be?,"This cd was a waste of money. I expected euro-dance and i got slow pop-rock/r&b. If you want something to dance to this is not for you. I was very disapoitned. This slow unoriginal album is boring and is not euro-dance. If you want to listen to good Anastacia music, get remixes of her songs, not this cd."
1,ONLY ONE SONG !!!,"I THINK THAT ONE DAY IN YOUR LIFE IS A GREAT HIT !! BUT, DONT EVEN ASK ABOUT THE REST OF THE CD !!! TERRIBLE JOB !!IF U ARE LIKE ME, IF YOU LIKE KYLIE MINOGUE,AVRIL LAVIGNE,SOPHIE ELLIS BEXTOR, PLEASE DONT WASTE UR TIME !!!ONE STAR ONLY 4 ONE DAY IN YOUR LIFE...THATS IT !!"
4,About the author,"G.A. Kathryns is a pseudonym for Gael Baudino. Anyone who liked this book should look for more under that name, as she has written no others under this one.I picked this book up several years ago, and have just finished it for a second time. The characters are all well developed, and the plot has enough mystery and depth to carry you through to the end.I personally found the ending to tie everything up nicely, though I agree that the run on sentences were a bit much. I think she was trying to emulate a style there."
2,Old Author - New Name - Old Tricks,"The Borders of Life would have been okay for a first novel, but it's the twelfth book from Gael Baudino, and once you know that it's just not too impressive. A predictable melange of Bradbury and Terrence Green's Shadows of Ashland, it seldom rises about the author's own apologies for the text at the beginning."
1,Hymns to an Unknown God,"Altough Mr. Keen is obviously well-read and, in a perverse way, bright, he puts himself before all others and invites his readers to do likwise. Unless one is convinced that what this world needs most is more self-centeredness, it would be best to avoid this one. I put my copy out with the trash."
4,"Hikikomori Beware, or The Diet Book for Anorexics","A haunting book for me now these twenty plus years I bought it at a woman's bookstore in Boulder, Colorado.There are, incidentally, real lessons in this book for those dealing with hikikomori dilemmas in particular.As a dyed in the wool occidental, this book showed me another path to happiness after years of largely inneffective mainstream style therapy.My subsequent search for my own path was greatly facilitated by the exposure to this thoughtful book.A long and detailed review would betray the book's message--look within, listen within, and in the silence your own voice will emerge.This book offers thoughtful examples, methods and case histories of the use of quiet therapies.The best music gives silence a pitch; likewise the best thoughts.Enjoy."
4,This truly is the MAXIMUM BOOM for your system.,"With a good selection of bass mixed tracks from some pretty phat DJs, this is a pretty good selection. And with two disks, what could be better?? Mo' bass for your buck. Take this all from a teenaged male who loves to thump (and owns this two disc set). This CD set is mainly songs for those who want quality bass. Other CDs of this type may also include frequency response tests (quick changes in the bass pitch) individual frequency tests, and full spectrum audio sweeps (high to low pitch). Those are for the serious system competitor. This CD set is not professional. It is just for the every-day thumper."
3,One of the best Pop Records I've ever heard!,"I purchased the Grand cd on ebay. I am a huge pop fan and the price was right. This cd has absolutely no filler whatsoever. If you are as big of a Pop fan as I am you will not be disappointed. I can't beleive this disc hasn't gotten a lot more attention. I highly recommend it! I did a Google search on the lead singer and main songwriter Jason Karaban. I think he has gone solo. I am keeping my eyes and ears open in hopes that he will be releasing some new material real soon. Again, I can't say enough positive things about this cd. Sincerely, Heather."
2,Overly descriptive in areas,"I enjoy this series and have read it several times now but every time the lead character gets into a car, I skim over the section because this author documents every street and turn like he is writing for MapQuest. I can see if the character is following a suspect but he writes this way all throughout. As I said I enjoy the books enough for a re-read but wish the author would improve his writing in this area."
3,OK,This is nothing new or spectacular but a decent tale about an alcoholic lawyer who finds a new lease on life through an appointment to represent a fall guy. More of a morality tale than a mystery.
5,Lost Legend,"I saw Bill play many times over the years in a fusion/free jazz setting and never knew until after his death that he began in New York With Bird and Dizzy.The scope and range of this man's career actually ranks up there with Miles and Dizzy but since the fifties he mainly played in the Cleveland,Ohio area which unfotunantly relegated him to the obscure category. He was also a well respected music instructor.Whoever came up with the concept of recording this album was certainly inspired .Its a fantasic testament to a performer whose playing spanned over 50 years."
3,Good Music - Bad Production,"I anxiously awaited the release of this CD. Galactic is a great band and on stage is where they shine. Wish there were a few more vocal tracks from my man, but overall it is a tight set.My complaint with the CD is the lousy production. It is recorded at a low level and it is a little murky in spots. I know these guys have a sound that rips live and it is a shame the CD was not produced and engineered a little better.Buy the album for the music. It is nice."
2,Not Galactic!,"I have followed this band over the years including its offshoot projects. Saw them live in 1999 and was totally mesmerized by the sheer intensity of groove laden sounds these guys can deliver. Stanton Moore alone is magic. So was anxiously awaiting the LIVE one, that too at Tips. But you know what, five minutes down the CD and you realize there's something - something big missing - The Groove. The feel. The funk. The soul.This is NOT Galactic as I've heard and seen. This is not the same band that gave us ""Coolin' Off"" & ""Crazyhorse Mongoose"" - get these instead while we await a real live one!"
2,Huge Disappointment!,I was at Tipitina's when they recorded this album. The shows were great! I don't understand what happened with this Cd. I anxiously awaited its release only to be greatly disappointed. I cannot even believe that they are saying this was recored during those two nights at Tip's. Basically the whole thing stinks!..Do not waste your money!
5,Chic & practical,These are beautiful! They are crystal like glasses that will be a daily goto due to the size convenience - love drinking water from them! and due to the shape & elegance will be at your dinner parties in all toasts.Highly recommend it!
4,Good basic info about spiders,"This book has some very good, close-up photos of various North American spiders, (unfortunately the Brown Recluse is not among them!) The author describes over a dozen spiders according to their habitats, i.e. fields & gardens, houses, underground, desert, & water. The spider's place in the Order of Living Things is also discussed."
5,Shoe Goo Review,"Shoe Goo worked great just like in the description. Works just like a rubber sole. Wears off after a little more than a week, but easy to reapply."
4,shoe goo,still holding up.. on the bottom of the shoe plugged the hole up pretty good..I have no problems with the product . would but it again! no Q asked!
3,Penal Battalion/Shtrafbat,"I had alittle bit of a hard time following the details of the story without subtitles. I think it was a alright movie, it would be better with sun-titles. I wouldn't recommend it, unless You are really into Foriegn WW2 films. It was definately interesting and the basic story line was easy enough to understand. But I left, myself wondering, some of the details of why that happened. Or why things didn't happen. I found it interesting that it showed drinking on both sides, then the scene where the Russian soldier raped a village girl. Who in the end hung herself. Why the Russian Officer gave the German P.O.W. his pistol, then the POW committed suicide? He was wounded, but the Russians seemed to be taking care of him."
2,Not the best shocks,"I replaced the shocks and struts on my wife's '03 Toyota Sienna LE with these Gabriel Ultras. At first they were fine. But a couple months later they began developing a squeak. The noise gradually went from being a mouse squeak to a full-on persistent loud squeak. I thought tightening them would help, but it didn't. A friend suggested I try applying marine grease to the bushings. However, it seems that I overtightened them and can't take the nuts off. I'm going to just cut off the stud and replace them with something better."
5,Fun puzzle/ not a 'toy' for me!,"I love this brand of puzzle/ have put together two other ones, and can't wait to buy the next one!"
4,it WAS a nice watch but...,i loved the way this watch looked on my wrist. The only problem was that it broke one morning while i was putting it on. I work in the food industry so it was great when i needed something that could just be washed off.
4,striking movie,Lots of year ago when i saw this film in a cinema i was very impressed...now i had it on dvd last night and the effect was same..it's really a good movie..John Savage's performance is fantastic..
4,A solid place to begin,"Researching Paganisms successfully portrays the multiplicity of its subject matter. This collection provides a solid place to begin one's explorations of pagan studies and--at the same time--addresses theoretical and methodological issues that will inform future discussions about the role of the academy in the study of contemporary religious traditions as well as the relevance of religion in contemporary societies. Contributions are all first-rate.""-Stephen D. Glazier, University of Nebraska-Lincoln"
3,The sovereignity and goodness of God,"Book arrived in 3 days, not too bad. Only issue was there was writing in the margin that awayed my opinion on the reading. Wasn't a easy topic to read. Only read it for an assignment in History class."
3,It's all right...well ok...,"Yeah Know... I really only payed the S&H so overall my complaints over this book aren't huge... It said the condition is ""Good"" and I would have labeled it as fair. The previous owner was all about highlighting text- and seeing as though I am using it as a textbook... that can be distracting. It isn't missing any pages and hasn't suffered any damage other than that...and it arrived on time... so over all a pretty good transaction and a fair product!"
1,Irritated my 3 month old,"I usually don't buy products when they first com out, but i thought this one was a great product. My three month old, like most other babies, has quite a few skinfold on her little neck, where moisture collects, and irrates the skin. I usually use regular powder, but am always worried about that, since i've heard it being harmful when inhaled. So, as soon as i saw this liquid powder i've bought two bottles. The first time i used in on my three month olds neck, she seemed very irritated and cried a lot. i've washed it off and she stopped crying. i thought it was a fluke. I used thi powder three more times over two weeks and every time she cried until i washed her neck. so, if you decide to use this on your child, watch closely for signs of irritation."
4,"Not a must-buy, but decent freestyle","""Lookout Weekend"" and ""When I hear Music"" pretty much carry this album. The rest of the album is okay, but those two songs really stand out. ""When I Hear Music"" is reminiscent of those old '80's dance tunes, with the robotic voice in the background. The same voice is in ""Lookout Weekend!"""
4,"very smooth and dark, trippy and mystifying techno","This is a very nice piece of techno music right there. Dark, mystifying, yet groovy and even funky this album is certainly capable of taking you on a journey :=) I don't think this CD is really danceable, i.e. this is not your swedish techno ala Adam Baeyer. Slow and smooth, dark and trippy, this is more of a chill or even ambient techno than anything else, but deserves four stars without a doubt."
1,a useless and harmful book,"It has nothing to do with the actual GRE CS subject test. What's worse, it is especially harmful as a test preparation book. Don't be midled by it!!!"

4,A must read for insiders,"This is a must read for anyone working in the spacecraft biz... or if a fan of the history of NASA, this mission and other missions to the moon.Not a fast read... and is the authors certainly biased view of the organizations he had to work with. Having had personal experience with most of the same organizations, I can agree with much of the comment. This is probably not a book for the casual reader, or a 'coolaid' fan of the US Space Industry."
3,Whoaa............,While some parts of this anime were really good and done rather well I was a little dissapointed in the story and thought that some of the content was rather distateful.
5,I cant believe they had the capacity to record during that time!,These are the original recordings from the Ziegfield follies. I bought them because my grandmother was a Ziegfield follies girl and danced in many of these songs (I have her newspaper articles which indicate which shows she was involved in). What a hoot to listen to a recording that was taped almost 90 years ago and know that my grandmother was dancing to it... The recordings arent 100% clear but I definitely would give them a 70% clarity rating. You cant expect much from a 90 year old taping session....
4,excellent photos - bad instruction booklet - eats batteries,The good features: The quality of the photos is excellent considering the price of the camera - clear and sharp with good color. Closeups are great. The photos download automatically when the camera is attached to the computer and the program lets you crop and add light and contrast to the photos before you store or send them.The bad part: The memory card lacks space so one needs to have spares when touring. The instruction manual is terrible and the batteries run out quickly while one is trying to understand the instructions. Scrolling down the menus while hunting for options wears out the batteries. You must have rechargeable batteries on hand and to save the batteries use the view finder and not the screen....if you can figure out how! There is a long wait between pressing the button and taking the photo.
4,LOVE IT!!,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE VERSIONS OF THE CHRISTMAS STORY...I LOVE TO SHOW IT TO NEW PEOPLE AND CHILDREN LOVE IT.
2,nativity,It was in excellent condition...i thought it was a DVD and was very disappointed to recieve a VHS that was very dated.
5,X-Men Revival,"I am a huge fan of this series even though I have heard it referred to as juvenille. I felt it was very helpful and taught many valuable lessons such as team work, friendship, and doing what you think is right even if no one else agrees with you. This disc includes the episodes 'Turn of the Rogue,' 'SpykeCam,' and 'Survival of the Fittest.' I would suggest the entire series to anyone including people who aren't necessarily fans of X-men."
1,Damaged,I just did not bother with the return process but the copy I was sent did not track. Was one of those cassettes where the entire movie is on a half inch of tape. Will wait for the DVD to become available.
4,"The Century Of Artists' Books, by Johanna Drucker","I like this book, because is very useful for everyone, who is interested in Artist's Books, modern art, cultural sciences"
2,Not what I expected.,"I added this to an order of other books about 'artist books' because the reviews said it was a classic, etc. Maybe it is, but it is really just s scholarly tome ABOUT the 20th century history/concept of artist books and some artists - very few illustrations (all B&W) to illuminate all those words. I was going to just return it immediately but decided it would not hurt me to learn more."
2,the leaning tower,I can't recommend this book. It's a cursory treatment that actually dates to 1971 and is probably long since rendered obsolete by fresh research.
5,I love this one too.,He really does wonderful interpretations of Guthrie's tunes. There's a very earthy feel to the whole album. Have played it a lot over the years. Vinyl's probably getting to the point of needing to be replaced. Glad there's the CD option on this one.
5,Perfect,This book arrived promptly. We used it extensively as we had a german speaking guest arrive shortly after the book arrived.
2,"A Good Message, But Awefully Short","This DVD contains a good message but unfortunately is very short and leaves much to be wanted. I was looking for videos of the songs from the Revolution CD, but I didn't find that. Although some of the songs are included in the brief video, not all of them are. In the future I hope Inhabited will think to make a better DVD to better express their music.If you are going to watch this DVD, make sure you first listen to the Revolution CD. That is one awesome CD that I recommend to all rock music lovers who like to get inspiration from the music they listen to!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY...DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"Anyone who claims to be a Nelson Eddy/Jeanette MacDonald fan, then writes a tepid 'sugar coated' biography deserves to have scathing reviews heaped upon the book.This is one of the worst biographies I have ever read. Almost everything in here has a false note to it. Any Eddy fan knows that the love of his life was Jeanette MacDonald and that Ann Eddy only used him for his name and stature.Aside from all the untruths in this book, the rest of it is all mish/mash and fodder. This book does a great injustice to a great singer and a fine actor.If you want to get the real Nelson Eddy story...read ""Sweethearts"" by Sharon Rich. There you will get the real truth and I wonder why biographers continually support the myth that both Eddy and MacDonald were happily married to others. Nothing could be further from the truth.Save your money folks....this book is not worth it, believe me!"
1,Boring bio of magnificent singer.,"This biography was authorized? By whom, I ask? Nelson Eddy was a vibrant, lusty man, who attracted waves of female fans of all ages, even in his opera years. But here, the author makes him dull and uninteresting, even hinting he had no relationships before marriage. She completely ignores a love affair with costar Jeanette MacDonald during his Hollywood years and the 14 year relationship with his nightclub partner,Gale Sherwood. I believe the author used Sidney Franklin jr., Nelson's stepson as her primary source.and her agenda was to protect the so called marriage of Nelson and his wife, rather than giving a true picture of Mr. Eddy. She has cheated his fans and done his memory great harm."
1,A waste of time and money.,The only good thing about this book is the jacket cover and that about covers it. No need to keep repeating the negatives and there are no pluses.
4,Closer to the Truth,"While Ms. Lulay's book has been described by those who knew Mr. Eddy as being a superficial biography, I can't help but feel it is much closer to the truth of this talented man's life than the ""Sweethearts"" biography. I would recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in learning more about Nelson Eddy, his life and his career."
5,Lamps for the Jetsons,"Futuristic lamps your passion? Then get this book. Sure, these babies are all almost fifty years old but what a collection. This is obviously a labor of love for the author. He even gives the reader display sheets used by department stores. The color photos are magnificent. Even if you are just a lover of the wild and crazy fashions and designs of the 1950s, this is a must own book. Who knew that tools for lighting could be so much fun and so imaginative."
3,Good product with one problem.,"These are packaged nice for a gift, and the wood feels great on sore feet. However the rubber rings on both sides come off fairly easy. To really be able to use this you must remove them. On carpet this works great. On a hard floor, you may scratch the floor or the roller."
4,Great for sore feet,I gave this as a gift and it was greatly appreciated for the receivers sore feet after standing all day at work.
1,False Marketing,"This 7.5 ounce is the ""mini"" version...not how described in the title. NOT ""Large"" which is unfortunate, because I know that I actually love the true ""Large"""
5,Awesome Deal!,I am very happy with the book I bought. It was described perfectly and I am so glad through here!
2,Not the Best for Me,"The main reason I don't like this book is that it relies too much on simply filling in the blanks with the correct form of a verb. In some cases writing a complete sentence is called for, but the sentences are short and easy. In addition, many of the vocabulary verbs are synonyms for verbs more commonly used. I much prefer a book that requires answering in complete sentences for a more thorough learning experience."
4,Review of Arco's College Survival Guide,"I can't say that this is the greatest survival guide on the market, but it's certainly adequate. It contains sections on almost all necessary topics, offering solutions for the clueless student. Also, this guide features many anecdotal stories, which add interest to reading. The book is very wide-ranging, with everything from packing list to tips on parties and dating. However, it lacks great depth."
4,New Edition Even Better!!!,"The fourth edition really helped me out, but the new edition made all the right changes...It even helps you out with understanding what computer to get, I wish I had known that three years ago!"
5,Fantastic Book with great advice!,"I am a residence life advisor at University of Texas and for years I've been recommending this book to incoming freshman, especially those with a lot of questions and concerns about college life. Students can relate to it because it was written by a team of students. Thank you Greg Gottesman for revising it again. There is another book that I wish every parent would buy for their children going to college, and that's Major In Success by Patrick Combs. I recommend getting College Survival to help your son or daughter make the adjustment, and Major in Success to help them standout."
4,A so so book. I wish I can give it 3.5 stars.,"This book covers most of the basics of college life. No surprises. No big discoveries. However, chapters 12 (Computers at College)and 13 (The Internet) are outdated. These things are so basic to a typical high school students at this day and age that these two chapters are either unnecessary or very inadequate. Chapters 6 through 11 are pretty good."
5,TH Official Guide To Family Tree Maker 2005,The book was in excellent condtion. It arrived quickly. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5,I love these books!,"I'm now 20 years old, but I was first introduced to the Christy Miller series when I was in junior highschool. I went to a Christian school, so I understood the books right off the bat. The Christy books are great...and I plan to buy them for my future daughter to read. The Sierra Jenson series is also good, but I don't feel it has the same flow...I don't relate to Sierra as well as I do to Christy. I have also gotten into the Glenbrooke series, also by Robin Jones Gunn. Did you know that all three of these series tie together? RJG is an amazing author...she's witty and brings alive the struggles we as women have, from our teen years to our young adult years. RJG has variety of characters, all different...and there is always one that you can relate to. Read these books -- from every series --I still read them (even the Christy ones!), over and over...and my husband has no problem teasing me every time I pick the same book up again!"
1,Only for the lover,"I bought this music CD because of the good critics in the reviews !!!! .. I'm sorry to have purchased it, the 'music' irritates me and it is absolutely no music for anytime, anyplace.You must be a real lover for this kind of music, that's not what the reviews tell you....!!!"
3,Got these for my 2001 Dodge.,Got these for my 2001 Dodge and they stick out about a 1/4 inch they just don't really fit correct.
2,You get what you pay for,"The Cons:These are not chrome, very thin stainless, center hubs are not stainless, hand holes are very small so you will have to purchase valve extentions, ($60 for decent ones), The front ones stick out off the rim about 3/8"", the rear ones 1/4"", when seated all the way in on my 2002 Chevy 1 ton. No center decal. Had to cut the plastic inner rings on the front ones to fit over valve stems.The Pros:Cheap, have a nice shine, fit very tight. If its all you can afford, they're better than rusty rims."
5,Could not live without it,Any new parent needs this. It is a true arm and shoulder saver. No more tired arms while feeding. It is not just for breatfeeding parents. My baby took little cat naps in this from the day she was born. It helps if your baby likes to sit up just a bit while napping.Any friend of mine that has a baby will get one of these from me.
5,One of the great voices,"This album is a real revelation. Lisitsian was mostly neglected since he was active during the closing days of Stalin's rule and the ensuing Cold War Years. But wow! What a voice! His Italian repertoire (in Russian!) is nice, but the real gems are the songs and Russian arias. The Venetian Guest's song is one of the great recordings of the century. And Pavel's ""Yeletsky's Aria"" from ""The Queen of Spades"" (Tchaikovskii) is worth the price of the album. Hvorostovsky's version is lovely, but listen to how Lisitsian caresses the first four notes--Ya vas lublyu (I love you). What a wondertul artist!"
5,Can you take it?,"Don't get this disc...if you don't want your view of singing after World War I to be changed forever. Lisitsian is a throwback, an isolate abandoned by hisory due to his singing on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain. And while I love his voice I have actually met people who don't like it. But what no one can deny is that his technique is reminicent of the last century and the singer he supposedly admired most, Battistini. I have called Lisitsian a ""freak"" and sometimes I think this word best describes him. One cannot classify him: ""artistic"" singer like Gobbi or MacNeil? Beautifully voiced baritone like Bastianini or Taddei? Comparisons are better to bel canto masters like Renaud, Ancona, and of course Battistini."
3,"Good inside, bad outside","This machine has great guts, but is poorly built. The plastic frame is not rigid enough, and mine does a lot of creaking and groaning when picked up. My DVDROM crapped out within 6 months of owning it, and the power connector has broken twice. Also, the battery gets really hot when playing games or watching movies.This would be a great laptop if had been given a more solid case with more reliable hardware."
5,happy to find this Little Golden Book,"This book was a favorite for my children and now my grandchildren. I have one from 1976, and it is in poor shape. I found this used book to be in good shape for a reasonable price."
5,Real Jazz Flute!,"This is the first CD of ""jazz flute"" that I have bought and thoroughly enjoyed. It's NOT your cheesy classical-player-botching-jazz recording. She's a real flutist playing real jazz. The trio is sensational - I especially enjoy track 8, ""the ambivert"". Their call and answer is SO cool! This was actually recommended to me by a professional jazz saxophonist in the Dallas area. I would recommend it to anyone looking for flute sounds in jazz music."
3,Average Read,I found this book to be a difficult read. The wider story line has potential but the portrayal's of Dredd and Anderson are two dimensional at best. Both characters have a second rate Bruce Willis Die Hard thing happening that is rather repetitive. The action scenes read more like a summary of facts at a court appearance than anything else. It was very difficult to suspend disbelief and the Dark Judges themselves lacked the ingredients necessary to be truly inspiring villains. Dredd is in desperate need of modernisation much like what was done with the Batman to bring him into the 21st Century. The transition from cartoon character to the brooding vigilante who struggles with his own demons as well as the villains he faces has ensured the Batman's future. Dredd and Anderson need the same remedial work.
1,Nnnooo,Did't want this book. It still dwnloaded. If you work for amazon what do I do. please help me I think it charged me for it too
5,A Juicy Spa Novel,"Serenity Place was an engaging read. It invites readers into the lives of every employee at Serenity Place Spa. Doesn't everyone want to know what kind of juice goes on behind the doors of an upscale spa and salon? Well, Serenity Place tells all. From the twins (massage therapists)who have sex with the customers during their massage session. To Lamont, the gay make-up artist who dates bi-sexual men. Not to mention, the female characters who just don't trust men.Serenity Place is a juicy ""tell all"" novel from beginning to end."
5,A must read,This is a must read book. It will keep your attention from begining to end. The author gets you deep into each character life as the story goes on. The author really brings the characters to life.
4,fun,"A fun, easy read with a group of characters that I would enjoy as neighbors. I will be looking for more Marian Babson books."
3,Modest shining,Fine introductive EP to the movingly competent post-rockers suffers from just enough filler to render this six-shooter just below beautiful.
3,Not alot of new information,"Was nice to see something written by someone who was actually there and involved with them. Unfortunately not enough of her actual story is included. Very much lacking the full story,but did have a few tidbits that i had not read before."
5,My Life with Bonnie and Clyde,I would recommend reading this book because it is probably the most accurate and honest depiction of the Barrow gang. Blanche tells what it was really like to be involved in gun battles and running from the law.
4,I waited with baited breath,I was so excited to read this. I have been very interested in Bonnie and Clyde and it was great to get an inside account right after it happened. Blanche wrote this while in jail so the accounts are very fresh and not that of someone recalling an event 50 years ago.Her accounts are very much selling herself as a victim and at points gets whiney but over all its soooooooo neat! I was bummed that there were not very many pictures of Bonnie and Clyde but I very much enjoyed the read. At points its a little hard to follow but the editor does his best to help with that. It was a tad annoying going back and forth from the text of the chapter and the notes in the back but all together a great read and I am very glad I bought this book!!
4,The other woman,"Blanche's book isn't too bad considering her notes seem to be hit and miss. It would of been better if there was a little moire information, but for any Bonnie and Clyde fan, a good read."
5,Like being there with the Barrow Gang!,"This book was GREAT! I am a huge Bonnie and Clyde fan (and an historian) and this is the best thing I've read on them in years. Blanche's memoirs are easy to read and very descriptive. The endnotes fill in details and what Blanche didn't quite remember (which is very little considering her circumstances). Highly recommended reading for the die-hard Bonnie and Clyde fan, or if you are just interested in the 1930's or the Great Depression."
5,A dramatic and very insightful look into another era.,"Incredible book! Great fun to read. I enjoyed the historical facts. Such as constant references to the time period. A vivid insight into the early days. The characters were real. If you enjoy anylizing a good read this is for you. This book really gave me a sense of the times. These people will illicit a range of emotions from pity, loathing, revulsion, sadness, grief. I strongly recommend. Especially if you have an interest in history with a personal touch."
1,f**k rats all day every day,this album is no good you shouldnt listen to rats. or someone who cries and pays rent. come out the studio and bring it to the streets PICO that is NUEVO side RK VK all day. NEW PICK PEEWEES CLICK!!! f**k rats!!!!!!!
3,Product doesn't match the picture,It is simply a rubber gasket with sticky tape. It does create a good seal but was rather expensive for what it was. Seller should have given a better description
2,It had a lot of steam in the beginning then slowly died.,"I had high hopes for this book when I first began to read it. It started off with so much power and strength I couldn't believe it, but slowly it became boring and wordy. Although I see how what he says is true, it is just as one sided as taking the gospels as 100 percent literal. He should have explored the possibility that both are true. A worth while read but don't expect too much."
1,Another bit of nonsense from a wayward Anglican,"Mr. Spong (he does not deserve the term ""bishop"" for Jack Spong is not even a Christian let alone a valid leader in Christ's Church) does nothing more in this book than present regurgitated 19th Century Protestant Liberalism. Spong always acts as if his version of Christianity is this brand new idea--ironically he is just repeating the mistakes of past and failed pseudo-Christianity. PLEASE NOTE THAT IN SPONG'S OWN EPISCOPAL DIOCESE, MEMBERSHIP HAS DROPPED BY MORE THAN HALF IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT SPONG'S AMAZING AND ""NEW CHRISTIANITY""? Understand that Spong IS NOT A SCHOLAR, though he would claim to be one. So, if you want a more honest (non-liberal, non-fundamentalist) look at the true Jesus of the Gospels, consult a real biblical scholar like N. T. Wright. Please understand that the Jesus which Spong presents will die and will not save anyone, only the Jesus of Scripture can do that."
5,Read this Book,"There are many books that describe the origins of the gospels, and each book has as its basis a theory about how the gospels were written and what they were meant to say. But even while there are some very good books out there, Spong's Liberating the Gospels stands alone as a unique, provocative, and challenging examination of the gospels. He approaches the gospels as a product of the Jewish mind in the First Century, and shows clearly what the intents were in the approach of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. Spong argues that the original gospel was designed to be read on successive sabbaths, as the Torah was read, and hence the organization and structure conformed to that format. He shows how the major sections of Matthew, for example, mirror the Jewish holidays and were designed to be read at those times. Spong's theory would be outrageous if he didn't bring to bear a host of examples which confirm his various hypotheses."
5,enlightening and faith enhancing,John Shelby Spong has answered so many biblical questionsthat were bothering me and has put much of the issue ofChristian mythology into perspective for me.Now I feel that I can get on with the task of being the kind ofperson God wants me to be because I have a much clearerexample in front of me of what that person would look like.That example is Christ as shown to me through the realJesus that Spong helps me to discover.
3,Good CD,"This CD has baby sounds (crying, a heartbeat, and playing with toys) mixed with music. It's very pleasant to listen to. We originally bought the CD to get our dog acclimated with baby noises but all he did was fall asleep while it played so I'm not sure if it worked or not."
2,choker and not like the Tiffany's version,Bought this as an inexpensive Tiffany alternative and it's a choker for my daughter and nothing like the Blue Box version. More like steel than silver. We have the Tiffany bracelet and the only similarity is the heart tag. Sent it back and will hold out for the Tiffany's.
2,Still waiting on my credit.,"I return the necklace on the 7 of Dec., Amazon receive it on the 11 of Dec. Still waiting for my credit."
5,"Amazing book, but don't pay what people are charging for used copies on Amazon","I bought this book a year or two ago and loved its no-nonsense approach to explaining one of the most (if not THE most, besides meditation and the Path) important aspects of Buddhism. When referring a person to this site to buy a copy I was pretty shocked to see a used copy of the book going for 70 dollars all the way to 140 or so. If you must read this book (and I highly recommend you do), go here:[...]I'm not sure if this is because the book is out of print, but it is a shame people feel a need to cash in on a book where the ultimate message is that all things are void of an enduring identity and inherently unsatisfactory. In short, don't feed the greed of those looking to cash in on this book and wait until Wisdom republishes it."
4,IT WILL HELP YOUR LEARING...,"The book that I received is a little different that the item int he piture, but same author and same material inside. This book is a great beginner's book. I will help with you pronunciation and sentence structure. Definitely a great book book...and it's not expensive either."
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,"Big, heavy and kinda rough but it's a jack and it's cheap. It lifts heavy stuff high in the air and it's got a nice wide arm on it so you won't crush any panels. And the holes in it probably do make it lighter, cast iron is just heavy and that's all this thing is."
5,Good product,"Nicely made. Really heavy duty. It's heavy as hell, as a matter of fact. I used it a couple times with no lubrication, then reading the instructions, they recommended a light oil, not motor oil. I applied PB blaster (great stuff if you've never used it) and it made the jack work so much smoother. Using this jack is so much easier than a floor jack if you have a lifted truck. If you have a 4 wheel drive and you like to work on it yourself, you need this jack."
4,jackall,A must have tool for home owners that work on their stuff and property.Fence work is the cats meow for this item. Worth every cent that you will pay.
3,Already rusting :-(,"I installed this on my jeep not even a week ago and it's starting to rust. Mind you it hasn't even been in the rain yet. The jack isn't powder coated, just painted which is a big bummer. I hope it lasts, but looks like I'll be pulling it off my jeep every so often and repainting it so it doesn't leave rust spots on the hood. Also the base is being held together with a y pin, don't see that last long either.. Other then that, not bad.. just a So-So product.. Nothing to get excited about....."
1,Wooden leg,"I jacked my jeep up with it, jack broke in two jeep fell on leg had to get leg cut off now got wooden leg. Thanks a lot"
2,Dissapointed,"Despite their claims, I mounted this to the outside of my truck and discovered it rusting within a matter of weeks. Disappointed by they lackluster powder coating."
3,Not so safe lift jack,"The jack lifts, BUT when lifting a heavy machinery it tilts forward like it wants to fall over. BUT it does it job, it lifts"
5,Real Arthritis Relief,Quite an interesting book. I haven't finished it yet but I am enjoying it.Shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition. Better condition than I had anticipated from the advertisement.Amazon has the Best price on the Internet.
5,What a game!,"It's fun to play with anyone! It's also good education to our children about life, own humanity, emotions etc. There is no any other games like this one!"
5,Finally WE get to Choose,"Its very cool. You get to choose who's the traditional Boardwalk and the rest. The best part is that they don't mention that you can replace them and reuse them. If you want Dr Doom to be Boardwalk one day, and then you want him as 'Marvins Gardens' the next, you still can. It's the perfect gift for any comic book lover of any age!!"
5,Amazing story,"Whitemare is the compelling story of the international FBI investigation that resulted in what was the largest seizure of heroin in U.S. history. It takes the reader behind the scenes in the making of this spellbinding case and exposes for the reader's consideration the unabridged factors which impacted daily on the agents and other investigators. It removes the myth and hype that surround many other law enforcement accounts of true crime while presenting the stress-filled and riveting moments along with the humorous, monotonous and frustrating ones. Whitemare is the unforgettable true story of a remarkable international law enforcement victory."
2,Do Not Buy for a Rabbit!,"I have a 7 month old Holland Lop, and she barely fits in this. Well, she wouldn't even go in it, so I had to actually put it on top of her to see if it would fit. She could hardly turn around in it, but she did manage to get out through the circular hole. I'm going to return this item after I build my own house for her. I spent like, $18 on this, and if you have a rabbit, even a dwarf, don't buy this item. Build your rabbit its own house with the $18+ dollars you would spend on this item.However, the reason why I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it would be great for any other small pet, like a guinea pig or maybe a ferret."
2,not large enough,"This house may say Extra-Large rabbit, but when you get it, it is clearly marked ""dwarf rabbit"" and is not nearly big enough for a regular size rabbit. I returned it."
4,"Functional, wish it was prettier","My guineas love their house. I wish it was a bit prettier as far as asthetics, but it's perfectly functional. Both my cuties fit comfortably in this house and usually sleep in it (as well as run into it when they get scared)."
5,A Rat's Favorite Hide-a-way!,"My rats LOVE this house. They all pile in together!I have to buy a new one every year because they love to chew, but it's worth it!"
2,20 great sopranos,"The songs are interesting, but the recording quality is worse than I expected. Many songs sound like they're from a 78 record stored in a dusty place."
5,The Pearl is preferable,"Naxos recently reissued the first four Concerti in these performances; hopefully, the ""Emperor"" Concerto will soon follow. Nevertheless, the Pearl issue has somewhat superior sound. The Naxos, while boasting very good reproduction of the piano, has moments of rather thin and strident orchestral sound. The Pearl is smoother, richer in body, and more open in sound. What the Naxos does have going for it is its incredibly inexpensive price; the Pearl is more than twice the price per disc. Still, for those playing these discs on wide-range equipment, I'd suggest the Pearl as preferable.As for the performances themselves, they are so well known that they need no be discussed in any depth here. it is sufficient to say that Schnabel remains the most probing and passionate of Beethoven pianists. Forget about modern hi-fi and stereo; listen to this set and get hooked for life!"
5,Beautifully Written,I really enjoyed this book. I could not put it down. I loved the town and the people in it. It was funny and I found myself getting involved with the charaters and especially Allegra. I even got teary eyed in one of the scenes. It is one of the best books I've had the pleasure of reading. And I hope Rebecca Rose decides to write another.
5,Finally a book that cuts through the BS and tells it like is,"In the competitive world of today's business world where bottom line and results are often the sole focus of business management, the real foundation of the company - its people and culture - are too often overlooked. Author Fromm, using vivid examples from his own business, and often some from his client's, illustrates how shifting the focus internally by treating employees like royalty and facilitating their efforts instead of creating obstacles, results in richer bottom lines, improved production, and better customer service. Fromm goes on, in an attitude rare among top execs, to state that a prime responsibility for any manager is to ""cut through the red tape"" that hinders top performance by an employee.Overall, a very well written book that is remarkably free of techno-talk and useless clutter. Fun to read and gripping in insights, this book should be on the table of every manager today."
2,Think Twice Before Buying,"This movie was certainly not worth spending the money on, it was very uninformative for the hunter with any knowledge of hunting. It really was not worth watching for a 30 minute film. I believe they could have done a much better job on this one. I bought it for my husband for christmas, but it wasn't worth it. The deer calling that they did have on this film was all common knowledge."
1,broke instantly,This charger broke instantly. I only used it once and it stopped working. Don't purchase this brand. It's not worth the time it takes to return it.
5,Great old tunes!,"I suddenly remembered these songs and was so excited to find this album on Amazon. The quality is like that back in the 1960's which brought back so many good memories. Who knew that not ""digitilizing"" would be a good thing."
5,Ozzy (The Ultimate Ozzy),"Great concert, Seen them here in Lousiville in 86. I wish they had this on DVD. If any one knows where or even if they have it out on Dvd. Give me a yell. Thanks Signed Ozzy Fan"
5,Ozzy on Video,MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD! They don't make 'em like this anymore! GET THIS IF YOU HAVE TO SELL YOUR BODY TO SCIENCE.
1,Buyer Beware!,"As a guitarist and fan of the short lived Jake E. Lee era I wasdisappointed to not being able to play this DVD on myDVD players.It was a region 2 only version, and while the performances weregreat by Mr. Lee I could only see the thing once on my laptop.Damn!Wish there was a US version."
3,Great for any Ozzy fan. No mess ups or anything.,Great but Ozzy looked fat and Jake was okay. Live and Loud is 3 times better than this one
5,great 1986 tour dvd,"This tour opened up in Wichita Kansas in 1986. It was a good choice to start his tour at too because they wanted to ban him there. So he went there first! This dvd captures that live tour and features songs that were played to promote his latest disc at the time: ""the ultimate sin"" . You need to buy a ALL region player to watch it in the states or canada though. This is well worth owning because in my opinion heavy metal from this era was the genres most enjoyable and was very melodic and well written. So get rockin with this one if you have a all region player."
5,region 2,thid dvd is region 2i know cause i bought one from cd universe and it is a region 2and it wont play in the statesif it ever gets released over here i will be in line to get it
4,PNW Pastor,"Swecker gives an excellent background of how organizations that are not the church, like the Institute for Religion and Democracy (IRD) have assulted mainline churches with agenda causing some of the issues mainline churches face today. He gives good historical background and the make-up of these organizations including the names of the board of directors, to illustrate how a few folk who are not within the mainline church organizational structure can infulence change. He also calls to accountability the church to ""wake up"" and see what is really going on. An excellent read ."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed as I particularly bought this CD for the song ""Are You Ready"". Instead of finding the original version, there is a long, tedious ""New School"" interpretation of the song. At least, the CD reviewer could have mentioned that in his or her review....then I would have chosed a CD with the original version and not have to look one more time for the song I love and remember."
4,Powder substitute?,"Not quite a replacement for cornstarch. Goes on cold and slippery, stays wet for a while. I have tried other products that feel like powder in a few minutes."
2,Easy to apply but..........,Product was easy and dust free to apply but did not produce the desired anti chafing like baby powder. It took quite a large application to keep the area dry.Angel of Mine Liquid Baby Powder - 9 Oz.
2,Forget your DVI monitor using this,"This box transforms the digital PC signal (DVI) into analogue VGA output, degrading your fast monitor back in time."
4,"Its mainly about nostalgia, but...","Some of my favorite memories from my childhood are of my father making Breakfast for the family on a Saturday morning while singing along to Blues albums he had cranked up on the stereo so loud that everyone in the house was woken up. This album was on frequent rotation on those mornings and that is what has framed my opinion of it. I don't think it is a real good showcase for Cotton's amazing Harmonica skills, nor is it full of significant songs. What it is is a whole lot of fun and perfect music for those times when you need a distraction from the task at hand or just want something to listen to while you sit on the porch drinking a beer. So toss aside the belief that music has to mean something, sit back, grab a brew and enjoy."
4,harp time,"not my favorite disc but i like it. james cotton is second to none on the harmonica. this might not be his best effort, but it's still good."
5,I want it too!!,Well add me to the list. Please get this for USA region. I would SO buy it!! :) (RA fan as well)
5,Same Here!!!!,"Okay I have never written a review before although I have bought tons of stuff from Amazon but this time I could not keep silent. I gave this 4 stars and have never seen the movie but from all the reviews I have read here and elsewhere it sounds really good. I fell in love with North and South (who wouldnt)and thought I would check this movie out. Very disapointed I can't get it here. Would buy it in a minute if it was a U.S. formatted dvd. Come on whats the hold up????? There are way too many BBC fans here in the states for this not to be on DVD here! Hope it will be soon. Oh, and yes I too am a RA fan."
4,Sparkhouse,Ive recently just watched North and South on Netflix and I have really come to like and absolutely adore Richard Armitage and unfortunately it is quite hard to find or get the movie Sparkhouse! North and South was the first movie I've seen on BBC and I am a huge fan now! I really hope Amazon gets this movie! PLEASE!
3,well well well i thought good movie not really,"well i am huge RA's FAN!!!!! thats why i bought it even region 2!!! also i bought region free DVD!! but guess what ? wow i dont like movie, i want to give 2 stars, but RA was casting that's why i gave 3 stars.if you are RA's fan He was on this movie not much. but He was very good acting this movie i was supplies. dirty un clean farm guy with not smart... he was very good. well like a sayIf you are RA's fan dont buy wast your money!!"
5,Simple straightforward autoharp fun,"This chapbook contains autoharp music and lyrics for fifty songs, each of which is easy to play. The books is light on instructional material, and heavy on practical, fun songs. The emphasis is on chord strumming rather than melody picking. All in all, this is a good singalong reference, with easy chords.I recommend this as a good book for the beginner who plays the autoharp, chromaharp, Qchord or omnichord."
4,Margaret Sutton's Clue of the Stone Lantern,"Twenty-first in this series which is partially based on real- life events of the author and her friends and family, this mystery story was published in l950. The setting is apparently not too much before that. It is the fifth mystery to be written in which Judy is married. As in a few previous books, this one features a little girl named Roberta, whom Judy has come to know well and to love. In this story, Judy is set on the trail of Roberta's real parents, who have been missing for most of the little girl's life. Roberta inadvertently provides the clue to finding them when she recognizes a stone lantern appearing on a seed package. Like other Margaret Sutton stories, this one is hard to put down and heart-warming. Although it is not my number one favorite, that is only because some of the other books in the series are even more exceptional, and I certainly recommend it, as I do ALL the Judy Bolton books."
1,SBM Supreme Light Diffuser for Canon 580EX II,"This product, at least the one I received from an Amazon vendor, does not fit my 580EX II. Not even close. It fit the 430 flash unit, so I may have received the wrong diffuser from the vendor, whom I contacted. If so, I will revise this review."
2,Does not fit 580 EX II,"in spite of the labeling, this diffuser does NOT fit the Canon 580 EX II strobe. No amount of pushing or shoving will get it on there. It does NOT fit."
4,Still a tight fit for the Canon 580 EX II Flash,"The company that I purchased the SBM Supreme Light Diffuser for Canon 580 EX & 580 EX II Flashes was quick to correct the size problem experienced from their first shipment. The second attempt is still a snuggle fit for my Canon 580 EX II Flash, but it works great for my Canon 580 EX. I think the manufacturer needs to go back to the drawing board on this design to make sure their product actually fit the Canon 580 EX II Flash that they are trying to accessorize. The seller of this product had excellent customer service."
5,This Excellent Diffuser does fit the 580 EX & EX II Read below.,"Hello Folks. This diffuser is of excellent quality & not a cheap piece of hard brittle plastic. This diffuser will fit easily on both the Canon 580-EX & 580 EX-II by simply heating the diffuser with a hair dryer. This diffuser is made of a higher quality plyable plastic & will form fit when a little heat is applied as previously mentioned. By the way, this is an excellent diffuser & does exactly what a quality diffuser is supposed to do."
5,Why didn't I have one of these before???,"First, this fit my Canon 580EX PERFECTLY. Second, I've always thought these were a bit of a joke, but after using this for just a few pictures the difference is incredible. Like night and day! I used to always bounce my flash off the cieling, but I can see that I won't need to do that as much any more. Nice bright shots with greatly reduced cast shadows. Highly recommend!"
5,wow.,"I was going to buy a $14.99 at a local store and was not that great. For 6 bucks this is one hell of a great diffuser, love it and just posted for another..worth every penny i have the 580ex II...Fits and does not slip..."
1,Didn't fit,"I picked this item up for my Canon Speedlite 580 EX II, and the diffuser did not fit on the flash as it claimed to."
1,Where is my order???AST Sport VPS2 Creamy Vanilla???,"It is telling that arrived, but not yet. Wats happen. I want my order as fast as possible because they are already 10 days late. Help me!!!Looking foward!!!"
2,Not good absortion,"I'm having digestion problems with the vp2. During at least one hour after I drink it, rather with milk ou wather, I fell a stomach pain and indigestion. Because of that, I decided to take just half of the suggested measure, that make me fell bether."
3,OK taste...,Tastes ok with milkChalk like taste with waterHave tried Optimum hydro whey before which tasted great with water also
2,Kind of freaky!,"My 16 month old received this as a gift. We both don't exactly know what to make of it. It kind of reminds me of a horror movie!! Its a cute doll, but I think its a little weird. The mouth opens when it sings... a little scary! I think my daughter is a little afraid of it. Maybe she'll like it when she gets a little older, but for now, she's not too thrilled."
5,Maggie Raggie is a hit!,My daughter received this precious Maggie Raggie doll for her 3rd birthday and she loves her. Maggie sings so sweetly and even opens her mouth when she sings! I would highly recommend this doll for any little girl!
1,No sirve,"La dejé a la mitad. La narrativa es puro rellenos, dialogos de los más torpes. Pesimas descripciones. Arrepentido de haber gastado en ella."
1,facil y estupido,"Es un libro para ninos por la forma en que esta escrito y la trama telenovelesca que solo los ninos se la creen. Hay un capitulo donde los personajes escapan del gobierno Frances y toda la policia los porsigue pero ellos van en un smartcar y los dejan atras (podrias creerlo). Todos sus rompecabezas y claves carecen de fundamento. Aunque se ve que hizo un intento de investigacion para escribir el libro, yo creo que aun le falta mucho para idear alguna trama verosimil. Su escritura tiene muy poco estilo. No hay madera de escritor en este autor. A lo mejor ya me volvi muy exigente, pero esto es basura. Lo lei hasta el final pero senti que habia sido una perdida de tiempo. Ahora cada vez que veo libros de este autor, prefiero comprar libros de superheroes, me los creo mas."
4,Better than the movie,"Now that I have seen the movie, It only worked to put a face to the characters, but I still prefer the book than the movie.Of course it is just a story not base on any reality, It is worth to mention that Brown has a strong knowledge and he is a good writer, but nothing that happens in this narration is true, it is just for the fun of reading."
3,"Trama ingeniosa, pero literatura de segunda clase","Le concedo al autor la pericia de contar una historia. Sin embargo, la idea no es nada original. Sale de un libro (famoso, por demas, y erudito)llamado ""El enigma sagrado"" (Holy Blood, Holy Grail). El otro problema es que el lenguaje es totalmente infantil. La forma de narrar es casi tonta. Cuando uno termina de leerlo, no queda en uno esa sensaci?n de ""llenura"" que deja un buen libro."
5,Una novela genial,"Es increible como el libro pudo atraparme desde un comienzo, incluso siendo yo un pésimo lector de novelas. El autor mezcla la ficción y la realidad, al punto de dejar al lector sin saber si lo que lee es real o ficticio."
5,No dejen de leerlo,"Excelente libro. Se puede decir que es uno de esos libros que te mantiene entusiasmado y atrapa tu atención página por página.Indiferentemente de la controversia que este libro ha creado, es una historia muy interesante. Obviamente es ficción y no van a faltar personas que se sientan atacadas por esta obra, pero es solo eso: ficción. No soy muy religioso y no me interesa discutir con nadie sobre ese tema, pero es un libro que definitivamente hay que leer.El mismo autor lo dice en su pagina web: ""El debate que se esta generando es una fuerza positiva y poderosa. Mientras mas vigorosamente debatamos estos temas, mejor será el entendimiento de nuestra propia espiritualidad. La controversia y el dialogo son saludables para la religión misma. La religión tiene un solo enemigo: La apatía; así que un debate apasionado es el mejor antídoto""."
2,un auténtico best-seller,"Una novela que te atrapa hasta que consigues terminarla. Las implicaciones religiosas y el juego entre verdad y mentira está muy bien tratado. El ritmo narrativo es intenso, y el autor lo mantiene ágil hasta la última página. El final es demasiado precipitado y el desenlace de la historia me parece infantil. La lectura se dificulta por las faltas de ortografía, las incorrecciones gramaticales y los errores tipográficos de todo tipo. A la edición le falta la intervención de un corrector, un profesional que corrija el estilo y la ortotipografía. Una acción que, sin duda, mejoraría la obra, le daría calidad."
1,El guión de una mala película de Hollywood,"Antes de comprar este libro, leí alguna critica en internet y decían que era emocionante, excitante, suspenso de inicio a fin, etc. Me da verguenza reconocer que lo lei hasta el final porque quería saber como terminaba esta espantosa historia. Pero mi consejo es: no malgasten su dinero en este mamotreto odioso, no lo lean porque sea la moda y si lo leen no piensen que lo expuesto por Dan Brown tiene un gramo de verdad.Para novelas históricas y emocionantes las hay mucho mejores que este desperdicio de papel y tinta llamado ""Codigo Da Vinci"" que para colmo lo harán película, no los culpo, el guión ya esta hecho, es terriblemente lineal y predecible, como toda mala película de Hollywood."
5,Canteazo de libro,"La verdad es que el libro esta debuti, te engancha desde la primera página y no te deja abandonarlo hasta que desgranas por completo la trama argumental y te invade esa sensación de desazón producida por el final próximo. Consigue mantener la tensión hasta el final. En mi humilde opinión este es el típico libro muy dado a relecturas provocadas por una demasiado rápida lectura (precisamente por la facilidad para engancharte).En definitida un libro que merece ser leido"
4,Un libro divertido que toca las raices de nuestras creencias,"Un libro apasionante en el que se trata un tema clasico y siempre controvertido.. la vidad Jesus. El senor Brown mantiene el suspenso a lo largo del libro pero tiene un final predicible.Muy entretenido, especialmente si se visita el website y se compara con los dibujos de Leonardo Da Vinci."
5,Simply Beautiful,"The Boston Camerata is characteristically superb in interpreting this new collection of 19th century Shaker spirituals. Like their previous recording of Shaker songs, ""Simple Gifts,"" the Camerata captures the hope and humility of Shaker belief, performing with bouyant movement and emotional clarity. By dividing the songs into thematic sections however, this CD is untimately stronger and more consistent than the latter. The Native American songs are particulary unique and the addition of a youth choir and the Shakers brothers and sisters add a freshness and reality to the smooth as silk voices of the ever professional Camerata. The tunes sound like a combination of folk and traditional protestant church music, but the lyrics reveal many elements of Shaker theology, some quaint, some still as revolutionary as they must have seemed in 1830. This CD offers an inspirational experience no matter what your religious background, the perfomances transcend definition."
4,Jam Packed With Ideas!,"Great book! I got the book to get ideas for something specific and this book has given me lots of great ideas for other things that I can do. While I am pretty good at sewing, this book is NOT for the novice seamstress. You have to have at least a basic knowledge of sewing and of pattern cutting and matching in order to work with the projects in this book. I have already completed a couple of the projects and they look wonderful."
3,Not the best PDQ Bach,"I have long been a fan of Perer Schickels and PDQ Bach and anxiously await any new album. Like so many great ""comedians"", what starts off great the compositional career of Schickele has gradually declined after the first three albums. No doubt, creating an original opera with nothing but a pre-written work by Mozart is a tour de force, but it's not really bed funny. Most of the title piece depends on pop references to ""Amadeus"" which was a very popular play/movie at the time. Schickele is at his best when he is satarizing musical styles and at his worst when he depends almost solely on anachronisms for humor. Actually, the Octoot (an early composition recorded for the first time on this album is the most successful work on the record. Not a ""bad"" album, but certainly not up to the standards of the early recordings from the 60s and early 70s."
1,My mistake,"This was a complete waste of funds and time. It didn't do what it claimed to do, and had no on line support.Don't bother. After trying I found a free, on line, program that downloaded and worked in minutes!I'm the fool!"
3,Ok for the price,"The quality is ok and you get what you pay for.Pros:Long battery lifeLong talk timeGood range from phoneCons:The sound volume is poor when using on the highway.The button is difficult to press when the device is on your ear.Holding the on button will sometimes connect to the phone, and other times it will dial the last contact on my phone.I lost this headset last week and I'm replacing with the H700 instead."
3,Inconsistent sound quality.,I bought this to pair with my wife's cell phone but she didn't like it and gave it back to me. She said it didn't fit her ear well and the sound quality was bad. I paired it to my cell phone and some times it was great but other times the sound was awfull. I now use it just for Warhawk on PS3.
4,Works pretty well.,"It's comfortable. Sometimes I don't no I have it on. Clear reception. Once in awhile it will slip off,but no big deal. I'm very satisfied."
1,Bad battery life,Was disappointed to find that this headset had very poor battery life. Longest time it has held a charge without having to be re-charged is 3 hours.
1,This headset is junk,"First, to the reviewer who mentioned that the H350 didn't fit very well, it's not just your ear. It didn't fit me right either. Second, maybe I got a bad one, but the audio quality was very poor (both for me and the person on the other end). In fact, when I called T-Mobile to complain about the headset, they couldn't hear me very well either. I think a boom would work better. I'm junking this baby and trading up."
2,Disappointing album,"I allowed myself to be seduced by the cover photo, which implied (to me) that the album would have vintage cuts from the 40s and/or 50s. Instead it's all current stuff, some of it interesting to me, but much of it not."
4,decent overview of Brazilian pop,"Part of an interesting series of musical ""journeys"" sponsored by the National Geographic. This has a nice selection of modern artists: Caetano Veloso, his niece Belo Velloso, Bebel Gilberto, Suba, Ana Caram and the like. The Quarteto Jobim-Morelenbaum provides a more traditionalist link to old-school bossa nova, and Fatima Guedes to the older acoustic sambas... The coolest part of this disc is the accompanying geographic/social info: a brief timeline of Brazilian history, descriptions of major musical styles and instruments, tips on various music festivals and, of course, one of those great National Geographic maps. Pretty mainstream, overall, but a nice introductory collection."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,"I received this for christmas and was so excited. I had saved about 300 blocks of memory on this card, and today when I turned it on, all the data was gone. I lost all of my memory for games I had beaten and levels unlocked. If I were you, buy the Nintendo version. It is $5.00 more expensive, but it wont let you down when you have 300+ memory saved on it."
1,UNRELIABLE!!!!!!!,"I got it for christmas, today is january 11. There were corrupted files and i losy everything (including ssbm and mario kart completly beaten) i am done playing gamecube forever."
4,Just bought it,I just bought this memory card. I hope it's good. Not sure what the other review has to do with this product. As for me...so far so good.
3,OK,Product is OK. Magnet is strong but It has a hole in the middle so it does not work well for things that need a continuious surface.
5,I Love This Book!,"I am new to cultivating lavender and I took this book out of the library only to find that it is INVALUABLE and I had to purchase a copy for my home. I refer to it again and again.The author is very knowledgeable and covers a variety of topics which are all of interest to me. Her writing style is engaging and you can tell the author knows her stuff.On top of all that, there are beautiful pictures throughout.This book helped me greatly to learn what variety works best in my home garden. Excellent book and a must-have for anyone interested in lavender. If you are looking for a recipe book look elsewhere--this book is for serious gardeners."
3,If growing lavendar is what you want to do,"This book is beautifully illustrated and very thorough in its contents about lavendar. Varieties, soil and climate conditions are all covered in this book. But it really wasn't for me. I would have liked to have seen a lot more recipes and uses for lavendar for which there are many more than what was suggested."
3,"OK, but...","...there are better lavender books out there for the average grower, such as Lavender: A Grower's Guide and the Lavender Lover's Handbook."
2,NOT DIRTY ENOUGH,"Thin weedy guitar mixed with lightweight VERY SLOW clean clean 'drum and bass' drum loops - it just does not work. Very light, airy, uninvolving melodies. A shocking number of tunes which I identify as 'album fillers', and too much mastering/engineering to give a squeaky-clean sound, again not what was needed. Just because it will not get you up and dancing, it should not be labelled as 'intelligent' or 'progressive'. Only two out of eleven or so stand out and stand up as good crossover tunes: is it worth it? I was misled by the reviews and dissapointed."
2,Ignore and get the real thing from the 1930s instead.,"Sadly, Skip James was ""rediscovered"" in the 1960s by white blues scholars and coaxed out of a dark Mississippi life. His energy sapped over 30+ years, the man is a mere shadow of the brilliance featured on his incredible early 78s. Get that Yazoo compilation for a taste of the most haunting, unique and brilliant blues recordings of all time."
3,Damn Lepers,"Not a bad little book. Short, moves pretty fast with some well written tension. Is it better than the movie? No. It is more or less what you see in the movie with the exception of the dead guy walking in the hospital, which is not in the book, the back story of Stevie Wayne, which is in the book and thats about it. The character Nick is awesome in the book, well written, strong, a real mans man if you know what I mean. I find the movie better because I think the actors make it great. The setting, music score, the ghost pirates, and of course the Fog and it is just a pretty well put togeter film. The book by its self is a decent ghost story. It will not scare you I don't believe and there is no real literary significance to the story. Perhaps it would have been better if I had never seen the movie. But I really did like the Nick character, just down right balls to the wall man of action that seemed to be so believeable. So thats my take on the book anyways."
2,Not very good,"I had to fight to get through this book. I saw it at the used bookstore and just had to pick it up. A novel of the movie The Fog? Why not. But it was boring as can be. It didn't spend so much time on the fog being in the town and all these ghost crew members causing all this mayhem. It instead concentrated on what was going to happen. The fogs comin...uh oh you better watch out....theres a weird glowing fog coming this way....its going against the wind....its still comin...you better be ready. And this went on and on and on. The climax was way to short because of it. Short book, I thought it would concentrate more on the good parts but no, we get backstory on the chick played by Adrian Barbeau and her kid for most of the book. If your interested in The Fog, just go watch The Movie (and not the god awful remake either)"
3,Too little use..,"When you read the product characteristics, your expectations will go high. In the best case, you will hope to find a useful mean to hunt and follow the elusive light of the measure tool, specially in the bright environments. What happens is that you only can see the light spot. Yes, a little better, but in the same way that you would do it without the glasses. Days will come when you can see the laser beam, and avoid to play the game of look and seek the little red point."
3,laser enhancement glasses,"they did increase the visibility of my rotary laser, however in direct sun, it is all but invisible out past 3 feet. Have to use them in the evening."
1,useless,uselessit didn't enhance my view work in any environment if I found anything useful for it i will update my review
1,Not Helpful,I purchased these glasses hoping they would make the laser easier to see in the sunlight. They don't. It was a waste of my money.
2,unneccessary,"My experience has been that the glasses help ""a little"" indoors, but not at all outside. I guess for the price it is ok to purchase but do not have high expectations for the level of improvement of the visiblity of a laser."
3,For the Price - It is Okay!,"Although the laser enhancement glasses are comfortable to wear, and they do help seeing the laser line (at least somewhat) - they don't live up to the claims made for it! In shady or low light - they work great - but you could see the laser line without them in this situation. In bright sunlight - they don't help that much!"
2,Still can't find long distance spots.,"Supposed to make it easier to see the spot where the laser is hitting. Indoors and short distances work okay, but don't notice much difference without them.Forget this for outdoors, especially for longer distances and when it's sunny.Not very comfortable and worried about them breaking too easily."
1,Useless,"Useless, unnecessary, and does not work. I bought because was cheap compared to the Laser Distance Measurer. I do not recommend."
3,Not a big deal,I tested the glasses in broad day light with my Bosch DLR130K digital distance measurer and I can not say that I was impressed. The dot is not that big but based on other reviews I was expecting better visibility.
3,"ok, but has limits",Works better in shade and cloudy days. Does help to see a laser dot outside but not in bright sunlight.
1,Useless,"This glasses is ment to be used with the laser measuring device, but I cannot see the benefit of it, it does not make seeing the laser dot any better !"
1,I read this as a young teen,"This book was in the young adult section of the library, and I checked it out and read it when I was 13. Looking back, I wouldn't think this is a good book for a 13 year old. It is about a girl who is molested/raped by her father, and her atempt to find the courage to tell someone to make it stop. While that's a good thing, the extreemly graphic, detailed and lengthy descriptions of her being molested are akin to writen voyeristic pornography to the point that I could see a pedophile even enjoying this book. I would not reccomend it."
1,This is worthless,"I bought this expecting to get 101 generic rock licks that I could use while improvising, but that's not what this book is. It's just a variety of very recignizeable bits and pieces of various songs, some rhythm parts, some solo parts. I would only recommend this if you're interested in learning three or four bars of a Nirvana song, two or three bars of a Pink Floyd song, etc. Like, ""Impress your friends by knowing the first two bars of Lithium by Nirvana"". You may as well just buy the songbooks for your favorite albums and get the whole songs - it's not like there's any analysis of anything in here. I can't see any purpose in this book existing except maybe if you're thinking of buying a Fender Cyber-Twin amp, this is a great demonstration of all the sounds that it can produce."
2,Rambling Reminisces about a Childhood in the Bronx,"Michael Pearson has the right idea, but the ideas that are gathered into the book are a little disjointed and fractured. If he could smooth out the stories so that blend one into the other, the entire book would read better.On the positive note, Dreaming of Columbus would definitely stir memories of the neighborhood for those growing up in that part of New York. He does have some descriptive stories of people, places and landmarks in the book that are entertainingly delightful.If you are a Bronx native, I would recommend this book so you can remember things you may never see again."
4,Lesser Known Spaghetti Westerns,"Not the big budget movies you expect from director Leone, but good story lines and decent acting typical of the genre. Entertaining and you'll see some familiar faces if you're a spaghetti western junkie. For the money very good value."
3,Defininitely Worth 5 Bucks,"This series is basically a collection of lesser known and perhaps B-Rated Spaghetti westerns. The good part is that they are all fun. The bad part is there are some very crappy movies on here ( I Am Sartana, Trade Your Guns For A Coffin in particular ). But the decent films save this collection....It's worth it for If You Meet Sartana, Pray For Your Death, where Garko makes a way better Sartana than Hilton does. Blind man was pretty great...not for Ringo's bad acting but for Tony Anthony's odd charm. And Strangers Gundown is a hidden gem, part ghost story part western...or is it???Yeah definitely worth 5 bucks."
2,Ringo Starr Fans Beware,"If you've purchased this DVD for the Ringo Starr film ""Blindman,"" buyer beware! The film may be in English, but it has been edited for content. IT IS NOT the complete film."
3,Gunslinger Western Collection,I am a big Beatles fan so i got this collection because Ringo was in it. I do not know if these movies were supposed to be serious or not but as for me I laughed so very very much at those silly things. you have to watch them for nothing else but to see the small gun one of the actors had on his person.
2,"Exhaustive, but FULL OF ERRORS","This book is a must-have for any mineralogist, but the number of errors is daunting. I can find a minimum of 2 significant (or major) errors per page of text. The errors include spelling of mineral names, errors in chemical formulas, errors in physical properties, errors in locality names, errors in state abbreviations for the USA, omissions in the indices, etc.I recommend waiting for the 2nd or 3rd edition to be printed to allow some of the more major errors to be corrected. Also, the pages are of such thin paper that text from the opposite side is readable. This book should actually be sold as a subscription on CD-ROM, with planned updates to implement corrections and additions."
3,Long-awaited reference needs work,"As a professional geologist, I use this reference often but I have found numerous errors. An example is that the mineral Pentlandite, an important ore of nickel, is not listed in the index. A German website is compiling an errata list on this book and it is many pages long of spelling, locality, formulae and indices errors. Other complaints are: The information concerning the economic use of the minerals is too sketchy and incomplete; and the page paper is too thin and fragile."
3,An exhaustive database of minerals. Should be a CD ROM.,An exhaustive database of minerals. It really should be a CD ROM.
3,"Very detailed, good index,","This book really needs to be on CD Rom. it is a very large book, and very exhaustive, but cross reference could be done better on a CD"
3,Is the publisher nuts?,"I can't believe that John Wiley & Sons (the publisher) actually tries to sell this book as ""compact"". It's 1100 pages! The Peterson Field Guide to Rocks and Minerals is a much better ""compact"" guide. This thing should really be on CD-ROM."
2,Very Average Watch,"This watch looked good online, and seemed a very good bargain at $9.99 reduced from around $30. However, when it arrived I was disappointed in how it feels as its quite heavy and bulky looking. The surrounding face plate also looks a little cheap. But for under $10 what can one expect eh? I will probably give it to someone as a present! Would I recommend buying it? No."
3,Overall is OK,"Lack of many other choices, we do find these pretty good. I would like to see more different designs like ones with a bit more sleeves as they would keep my kids warmer. The wash up just ok...not great."
5,wonderful,"1. Exactly how ""long"" (inches) the sleepsack actually is.2. If there would be an option to purchase a long sleeved sleepsack.3. How to reship if the product did not work. (It was shipped UPS, but delivered FedEx; that was a little puzzling.)Overall, this sleepsack is great! My son likes having his feet out of the blanket because he does not feel confined!"
5,Great sleepsack,I love this sleepsack. The fleece is cozy and warm and I don't have to worry about my son kicking off his blanket in the night.
4,Had to return,"I liked the design for older kids with the openings for feet but the product description never says ""FLEECE."" Ordered this at the end of the winter looking toward using it for the spring and summer. Returned it for the ""LIGHTWEIGHT"" sleep sack. Works better but I prefer the cotton knit used to make the infant sleepsacks to the mesh used for the older kids. My daughter doesn't mind it, so we're using it!"
5,Great product,I have purchased Halo sleepsack for my 3-year-old son since he was baby. Love the big kids sleepsack with the openings for feet. It allows him to get out of bed in the middle of the night (now that he is in his big boy bed and can get out of bed freely).
5,Love this product!,"I love these sleepsacks. My 2 year old won't stay covered and I don't like running a space heater. I use varying layers underneath depending on the weather and he stays snug. I think he likes it too, he's able to tuck his legs underneath him when he's sleeping, stretch out, etc. I will say that it looks really big out of the package and others said they run big. I don't see that, the 2-3T fits my 2 year old well but probably not for long. I ordered a second one so he could have a clean one to wear every night. Love it!!"
5,Great Comfy Sleep Sack,"My son went from swaddles to Halo Sleep Sacks, and I just love them. He wears either cotton or fleece pjs and the sack, and it's all he needs to stay warm at night and during his naps. I like that I can tuck his feet into the sack when he's in his crib, and stick them out through the foot holes if he wants to walk around."
5,awsome,"I'm a mom who constantly is worried that the baby is uncovered and cold. This keeps baby covered but allows for what myself lov a foot out to regulate my own temp so I don't get too hot. Kids love them and free feet mean they can still get up and walk to your room if needed,"
4,They really do run big!,"I ordered this sleep sack in Large and the 2T-3T for my son who is just growing out of his 18 month clothes now and getting into 24 mo or 2T stuff. Even the Large size for 22-35""/22-28lbs is huge. I'll be returning the bigger one because I don't think he will wear it until he's 10, haha! My advice is to consider the sizing to fit the legs within the sack even if you sealed off the feet holes. The crotch reaches their foot level (give or take). The good news is that I see it being a product that lasts a long time as they grow and that crotch rises upwards to the calf, knee, and thigh."
3,"Does the job, but slips off feet easily",My only issue is that these tend to slip off my daughter's feet. Otherwise no complaints! Keeps her warm and happy through the night.
5,Great Product,Great product for little ones who don't stay under the covers in the winter. My son loved to sleep in it and wear it around in the morning. Love it!
5,Great product!,"The Halo sleep sack is a great product and my two year old LOVES wearing it! It is very soft, roomy and keeps my daughter very comfortable and warm at night. She can't wait to put it on for her naps and at bedtime. It is basically just a big, soft blanket that kids wear, and as parents we don't have to worry about it being kicked off at night."
3,I don't like it as much as the pre-toddler version,"We use it, but it does have legs built in so if jammies don't have footies, you have to put on socks. I don't like that. I would like a bigger version of the pre-toddler sack. It does still keep them covered up though, and there are no worries about getting wrapped up in the covers."
1,Sack is too large,"The sack is actually larger than described, and and it was way too big for my 3 year old daughter. My daughter and I loved the sleep sacks, but these Big Kids SleepSacks are just too large and could cause tripping. Very disappointing!"
3,disappointed,"Bought when my child outgrew the large size and this was gigantic. Very warm so if you live in a warm climate, forget it. Even with the air conditioner, my child was sweating. I did like the idea of the feet, maybe they can make them in all cotton for warmer regions."
2,Much shorter than expected.,We were disappointed that the sack portion of the 2T-3T Big Kids SleepSack Wearable Blanket with foot openings is about four inches shorter that the XL SleepSack without foot openings which we have been using for some time.
4,Warm and snuggly,My 4 yr old hates wearing a blanket and I always had to wake up in the middle of the night to check on him. This works wonders. He loves wearing this because of the foot holes and it keeps him warm. I don't have to worry about him kicking off his blanket. Fits him well with room to grow. He can also unzip himself easily for potty emergencies.
4,sleepsack,"the sleepsack i purchased for my 2 year old son, excelent for him to sleep confortable and cozy. He feels warm all nigth and dose not wake up at all."
5,Mount beacket,I received this mount fast and was completely satisfied with it. I recommend this dealer with an A+ rating for service and product satisfaction.
4,Expected More.,This car is really cool but i expected more.IT has kinda poor range and i like the fact that you can build different models but the steering is not good.
5,This toy is a hit!,"My 8 year old son got this for Christmas and it has been the hit of the day, he loved building his own dragster and races it anywhere he can!"
1,Don't Bother Buying it!,"I was Very Unsatisfy with this toy.The impression i got it was already built. I gave it for a gift , when they opened the box up, It was in a million pieces that had to be put together. It took about 2 hours. When it was finally done, they put it on the floor and it hit the wall and broke all over... I do not recommend this toy."
5,Supernatural Season 3,"This show is unbeatable! The chemistry between Sam and Dean is great. This is a show for anyone who enjoys a little scare, and a whole lot of fun. Only one big problem...season 1 and 2 are not blue ray yet!Looking for season 4 soon."
2,Worst Season Yet,"I remember watching the first season religiously. I went to any length necessary to see episodes that I missed. The show was great! Then came the second season where Dean was an emotional wreck and Sam turned into a wimp. Okay, fine, it's the second season - it will get better. Third season comes and it's pretty good...right up until the writer's strike and all of a sudden I don't get the other 8 episodes promised, leaving plot holes and an overall disappointing season. Then, they want to charge the full price of a regular season for 2/3 of a season provided.I don't pay full price for 2/3 of a haircut.I don't pay full price to see 2/3 of a movie.I don't pay full price for 2/3 of a pizza.I won't pay full price for 2/3 of a crappy season, even if it is my favorite show (it's a sliding scale)."
3,Supernatural Season 3,The sixteen episodes varied in quality though it seems they got better for the most part as this season progressed. Due to the writer's stike there are only sixteen episodes vs the four to six extra epsidodes enjoyed in prior seasons. If the price is in the mid twenty dollar range or below I would say it is well worth it. Otherwise wait for the price to drop or rent the dvds at any video rental store you can find that has them.
5,Supernatural High!,"I've watched this series from the beginning and it just keeps getting better. It has everything a person needs in a tv series, horror, humor, and even some family fun! Not to forget, it also stars 2 of the hottest men in tv & film! I will never love another show like I do this series!It has an awesome cast and crew, and absolutely some of the best story lines and plots ever!"
4,keepers!,"I love this product! (of course that has nothing to do with Amazon. I'm just a SN geek.) It was delivered on time. I've enjoyed watching it with my siblings. Sometimes the discs skip, but I can never tell if it is the DVD player we are using or the DVDs themselves. Needless to say, I'll keep them forever! :D"
4,Awesome Show; DVD extras needed work,"Supernatural is one of the best shows on T.V; it is definitely the most addicting. It is well acted, written and directed and has some cool special effects. It is not a superficial show just for teens like most of the others on the CW. It has depth and intelligence, as well as incredibly hot stars! As for the season 3 DVD, it showcases all of that and is therefore very entertaining. However, because of the writer's strike, the season was short. Instead of making up for that with more extras, we got less: no full-episode commentaries, no commentary at all by Jensen Ackles or Jared Padelecki, no behind the scenes with the actors, and the gag reel seemed more mugging for the camera than goofs caught on tape. That said, anyone who's watched seasons 1 and 2, MUST watch season 3!!"
4,Changing it to blu ray,i have removed this item from my playlist because am changing with the same title but on a blu ray format.
5,SUPERNATURAL RULES!!!,"WITHOUT GIVING ANYTHING AWAY, ANY FAN OF THE X-FILES AND HORROR THEMED ""ANYTHING"" WILL LOVE THIS SHOW LET ALONE THIS PARTICULAR SEASON.HOWEVER YOU DO IT....GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS SERIES, WORTH EVERY PENNY."
4,Slowed Down But Still Rocking,"This season seemed to slow down a bit. With ole' Yellow Eyes dead, and now this impending doom over the brothers we start to get prepared for Seasons 4 and 5 in this one.We meet two prominent demons, Ruby and Lilith that will remain in the focus for this season and the next. As such, the tone of the show changes a bit, things are a little more serious and things become a little more worisome.The brother's relationship takes on a bit of strain, but overall their individual characters remain the same, which is good. Overall, still an excellent season."
5,Greatest Show On Television,"This is the only show I will go out of my way to watch, my husband knows to not talk to me unless it's during a commercial when it's on.Supernatural gets better and better every episode with every season. Eric Kripke definitely knows how to keep the fans of the show coming back for more!I can't wait until this comes out on DVD and I can't wait until season four comes around!"
4,About time,"I love shows like this. It's edgy, hip, funny and dark. Due to my busy work life I'm not able to catch most of the shows. So, now that I have seasons one and two, I could get all caught up and preorder three."
4,"Winchester-boys good as ever, but only 5 DVDs...","Supernatural Season 3:the Season 3 is great as always, not as scary as the previous 2 though. Dean and Sam are trying to find a way how to get Dean out of his contract to not go to hell.I personally thought the journey would take them far longer to safe Dean. The Season Finality was so fast moving, that you can only sit speechless infront of the TV.Due to the writers strike there are only 5 DVDs, which made the Season look very small. I purchased the Season because I am a fan, but if I would not be one, I would have not paid the whole price for a DVD less!"
5,The best horror series ever?,"If it isn't, it's pretty darn close. Supernatural just gets better and better with each passing season. I just watched the third episode of season four last night on TV and it looks like the current season is heading in the right direction. This is the only great show the CW has ever produced. Most people make fun of the network, but I bet they haven't watched this show. It has good acting (the two leads are very likeable), clever and often funny writing, very good special effects, a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline. Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it's quality. If your a horror and action fan like me, you won't find any show on TV better than this. Okay, maybe Dexter, but that's more thriller than horror."
5,Best show you are missing out on,"I so far have bought all seasons of SN. I think the show is amazing. It has some comedic edge to it, drama, action, and that touch of scary but not too scary. The show is centered around two brothers and the actors who portrayed them, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, do an amazing job.Try out,you wont regret it."
5,Amazing,"This show is amazing. I can't get enough and I'm just thrilled to have all three seasons in my possession via Amazon.I was very pleased that I rec'd volume three so quickly, it took my other orders quite a bit longer to arrive.I haven't had a chance to watch the dvd's yet, but I'm looking for a really dark, cold and windy night to curl up and watch the Winchester brothers take on the world; between the funny comments and the twists and turns, you can't go wrong. I love the way the guys interact with each other- you laugh one minute and cover your eyes the second."

2,GHOSTFACERS EPISODE 13,Great Show until Episode 13!! Worst episode of season 3!!! WHAT A WAST OF FRIGGIN TIME!!! Worst episode I have ever watched. PLEASE STOP PRODUCING GARBAGE EPISODES LIKE THESE or I'll stop watching!!
4,review supternaturel season 3,Like this seaon very much. Want to know how it will end with Dean. Probably fine because there is a season 4.
4,Good!,"This product wasn't in the condition that I expected it to be in however, everything went smoothly and shipping was pretty quick. Would highly recommend ordering from this seller."
4,a must see show!!,"I'm really not into anything that scares me in the movie or tv region...but my roommate introduced me to this show last September and I absolutely fell in love with it!! I LOVE Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles...they're both amazing and make this show the greatest thing ever!! I've even reached out and got some of my friends that weren't fans before and made them fans by letting them watch it!The third season is such a trip! Watching Dean's journey through his last year is both funny and tugs at your heart strings a little watching them fight to save him!The only thing better than this season...is the one after it! But that's not exactly out to own yet...so we'll just have to be patient. :)I would seriously recommend this to ANYONE (actually I DO recommend this to everyone I know, pretty much)...especially if they don't mind watching somethin that scares them once in a while...and even if they don't like scary stuff...it's worth it for Sam and Dean Winchester :D"
4,Not Season 1 or 2 but still great,"This season was somewhat of a disappointment after the thrill ride of season 1 and 2. With the introduction of the questionable characters Bella and Ruby and with the constant killings of demons instead of other folklore that made season 1 and 2 so entertaining, it's a bit lacking.Don't get me wrong. I am still going to order season 3 and watch it over and over again. Supernatural is still by far my favorite show. Not only that but it seemed to get through the writers strike very gracefully. It is just not comparable to season 1 or 2."
1,Missing Pieces,I didn't realize until I had thrown out all the packaging that I was not given the last DVD disc. Instead I was give two of one of the other DVD discs. Very disappointing.
2,1/2 the session for the same price?,"This review is not on the content but rather the pricing. This was the season that took place during the writers strike. (The writers even poke fun at themselves in a returning episode when they call themselves ""lazy fat cats"".)My issue is why would I pay same amount on past season's DVD sets with full episode lineups when this one has half. I just cannot bring myself to do it. The extras are not worth that much."
5,Supernatural always super,"Season three picks up right were season two left off. The brothers are trying hard to clean up the mess they made and to keep Dean alive. We also get to follow Sam as he perhaps inches further to the dark side. In terms of story line season three does not dissapoint; lots of angst, drama, and those pained long looks we true fans love. Season three also has what is probably the best comedic episode of the entire series so far ""Ghostfacers!"". The down side? The extras are sparce at best and there are fewer episodes. This was writter strike season and i'd say it affected the bonus material. Thankfully the season is meaty enough that the faux pas is forgivible."
5,Supernatural,"The story lines can be real emotional life between two brothers, and Jared and Jensen can't be topped for their true to life performances. Can't believe how close to this day and age this story line rides, which makes it all the more entertaining. The writters always come through on the story lines, it's clean enough for all ages and there isn't anything out there like it. Really like the moments of comedy too.Who would have thought of modern day heroes given everything else there is, I'm really glad someone did. And this is my favorite show."
3,Condition,"I buy quite a few movies through amazon, however, I was very dissatisfied when I opened up my package of movies and saw the binding on all the movies were in perfect condition, except for Supernatural Season 3. I wouldn't normally complain, but Supernatural has and will always be my favorite TV show and seeing that made me quite upset. They have given me the assumption that they don't particularly care for each and every one of their customers, considering they get many people from all over the world and they always come back for more. I thought about returning it, but decided not to, b/c I'm not going to pay shipping again and again just to get the same condition."
5,Little Brother Takes Care of Big Brother,"If you look at the DVD cover, it pretty much tells you what the season will be about. Dean does not have much time on Earth as he has a year left before the crossroads demon comes to collect on his soul for hell and Sam is on a mission to find some way to keep Dean alive.This is a season where you see both the brothers' relationship take a deeper turn, as you see Dean living it up knowing that his last days on Earth are near, but at the same time making sure that his little brother is alive and well after he leaves, and Sam trying to find some way to keep his brother alive, knowing well the risks involved.There is more brotherly drama in this season, and it is interesting to see how the two actors try to reconcile there differences before Dean goes to hell, but at the same time express there love for one another knowing well what is ahead.Very good acting and even better story-telling. I recommend it!"
5,Supernatural,"Love this show...a lot! Why are they contemplating another season? I hope it goes for at least 15 seasons. It is exciting, suspenseful. The stories are so interesting, and I love the bond between the two brothers. It is great that their is a show out there that is not a stupid reality show. Don't get me wrong though, I do love jersey shore, but I miss these type of shows. Shows that had a great storyline, I think that ended after the 90s. This show is amazing, and so is Jensen Ackles!!!!! Each season keeps getting better and better."
5,Great Season,Supernatural has been close to cancelled i've heard for awhile. which i think almost helps because it causes them to think of new ideas to keep people hooked. Bella and Ruby i think were a great addition to the show. The high quality definition just makes this show even better.
2,just an ordinary biography,"It has been almost 100 years since the publication of the book ""The Secret Doctrine "". The ideas in this book and quite obscure and none of them has been correctly verified or confirmedIt is neither a popular nor a great book.Now the author in this book considers H.P. Blavatsky as a saint or super genius. There is a lot of details about her life . But these are only for those who strongly agree with and believe in her teachings - there are not too many.I am surprised that someone bothers to research into the life ofan obscure person hardly recognised in the world"
2,Boring!,"Yes, this is a fast read, but it's boring! I was looking for more spice, which is something very much missing from this book. Honestly, this book will appeal to women who are wowed by educated women dabbling as strippers and who don't want to hear about the real realities of this business. Moreover, I think this book lacks an edginess because lucklily the author was in a good life position---she had a high-paying ""W-2 job,"" family support, an education and part-time employment in a well-managed bikini club---things most women who find themselves in the stripping business won't ever have!"
2,Not too bad - something most people would know before buying,"After reading, I didn't think it was too bad. The only reason I had against this book was it being general info on the subject."
4,Eclectic Africa,"It's too bad the samples are of the first songs on the CD, as the best tracks are 7-9. This is a potpourri of musical styles, so you must be very eclectic in your tastes to like this album, much of which is not in English. The one cut I really did not like was the jazz cut, but then, I don't like jazz much. Other than that one song, I liked the rest of them with varying intensity. For people looking for World Music artists to interest them, this album provides a number of artists who are famous in their own countries who provide fine examples of the type of music they play."
3,"Aluminum Rollator w/8"" wheels","The product is fine except for the locking mechanism on the side. It is very difficult to unload the chair out of the car and try to hold on to it and pull on the locking button to unlock it, especially when you are handicapped. It is very difficult to maneuver."
5,An excellent buy,"A sturdy, fully equipped walker with a spacious saddle bag on the front. Also, under the generous, padded seat, you are given the option of using the included shopping basket or a giant, flat-bottomed storage bag. The walker has extra large 8"" wheels that move easily over any terrain and hand brakes that can be locked for extra security. A value that is worth the money at twice the price."
1,very disappointed!,Received the walker in a timely manner. Walker seemed sturdy but the walker handles would not screw on properly. I contacted the product customer service department & they sent out new screws to try. The new screws did not work so contacted customer service again & got the run around. Not helpful at all even though it was a manufacturing defect. Walker can not be used without the handles being screwed in securely! Returning the walker and ordering a different brand!
3,smaller than picture,"Bought this for my 91 yr old Mom. Her Jitterbug phone didn't fit in it, but otherwise it's a great little compact purse."
1,are there minus points? same as mars and venus,"As a woman I am annoyed when I read book after book carping about how men are ""supposed"" to be visual and women are ""supposed"" to verbal.I know for a fact that I am visual and no book or research on the planet is going to get me to change my mind. It leaves us visual women thinking ""what planet am I from"", ""where is my place in this gender specific world we now live in"" there is still not a planet for us,where indivduality is cherished and human beings are viewed as unique. When I read books such as Men Are Visual...bla bla..it makes me realize that there is an agenda to keep attitudes status quo and sexist,to keep men looking at women,and women swayed by words of romance and love,and to have us believe this is innate and normal,to have us trapped in narrow immovable boxes."
1,Men Are visual Women Are Verbal,"Very low rating, is apparent a man wrote this book, women are as visual as men in each and every way. The first thing a woman or girl talks about is the way a man looks and how he is built."
4,Just my complaints,Wanted to say that the picture quality is somewhat lacking. Could have been better. And to state that there is NO analog to digital pass through feature on this camera. You can record from an analog source to the miniDV tape on the camera but it is NOT pass through. Thats all...the rest of the functions are up to par with what they have advertised. All in all a pretty good package.
5,good ablum even if sang by a wreslter,ok ill amited i am a wrestling fan this ablum is great u should buy this ablum people who hate wrestling or dont watch it will hate on this ablum but if it wasnt sang by a wrestler u know it would get better reviews (also WRESTLING IS NOT FAKE ITS FIXED BUT NOT FAKE AKA AUSTIN INJURY)
4,Jericho can sing!,"Forget what Katherine Turdman says about this CD, Jericho can sing and the band is tight with great production. This is no joke as Jericho is an avid metal fan and puts his all into it. True, the band is not real but it is a funny idea; the name Mondo McQueen says it all. This is a great 80's metal cover CD that outdoes most of its competition as far as cover CD's go. It's refreshing to hear these older songs with a thicker sound and production value. Wrestling fan or not, if you like your 80's metal and have a sense of humor pick this up."
4,Very Good... and I don't like wrestling,"OK, let's face it, if you're here you probably know who Chris Jericho is and that's the only reason you're here. Many people have said that only wrestling fans will like this, but that's not true. I don't watch ""professional"" wrestling and could not name more than five ""pro wrestlers"" if I had a gun to my head. I got this album because I read ""Metal Edge"" (Jericho writes a column in it sometimes) and I saw an add for it. I figured why not try it out? I got it not expecting much, but it blew me away.Every time I buy a new album I listen track 1 to the end, usually weeding out that which I never want to hear again. Very few albums are ever beginning to end for me, but this is one of them.So why not five stars? I realize that while I like it, many people I know who like rock probably wouldn't like it so I'm just trying to give the most impartial judgement I can."
4,the kings of metal have returned!,"OK first of all lets get one thing clear. It is obvious that Chris Jehricho is the lead singer of Fozzy. I also have to question the whole story of Fozzy being so popular in Japan and all that stuff. I will say however that this is great music for any metal fan. Some songs such as End of Days are not very good but most of the songs such as The Prisoner, and Live Wire are above average and Eat the Rich and Stay Hungry are excellent. So what are you waiting for go out and buy this now!"
2,muppet metal?,"ah! finally, a band named after one of the muppets! i heard this disc, and all these songs before. ive played in cover bands for years, even played these songs, why would i buy this!!"
5,Fozzy's first disc,"Fozzy's first disc is covers of songs from the seventies. I don't usually care for covers or remakes, but this one was really well done. I especially loved their rendition of The Prisoner. Very impressive. I now own all four of their discs. Having met Chris Jericho and finding what a great guy he is, I would buy any of Fozzy's discs without hearing any of the songs first. Awesome band!"
3,"Works as a novelty item, but not as a metal album","Sorry guys, but this just isn't a 5-star album any way you look at it. Don't get me wrong; I think Chris Jericho is hysterical, and I know that his love for metal is real, which is evident in the songs he chose to cover on Fozzy's debut album. Still, the music here is average at best. The Stuck Mojo guys do a fine job, but Jericho's voice isn't quite up to the task of taking on Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickinson, or Rob Halford. He definitely gets an ""A"" for effort and for paying tribute to some of the all-time greatest metal artists and songs, but calling Fozzy a 5-star album has a lot more to do with Jericho's WWE popularity than his musical ability."
1,Stupid Wrestlers wanna be Singer?,"I can not believe how many people are saying that this is a 'real metal' album or even a 'good album'. This album sucks so much that after i heard it i wanted my 60 minutes of life back that i wasted. I was hoping it would get better as the songs progress but it didnt!If you don't believe me then get this used somewhere for like 50cents and listen to it.Ozzy is a god among mortals and shouldnt be disgraced by this dumbass.BTW: 1990 just called and they want their dumb asses who use the word 'u' instead of 'you' because they are soo l33te. Keyboards have 104 keys or more, try using them!"
5,WRONGS have been righted.,FOzzy are back from their 20 year imprisonment in japan and still rockin' hard. they have come back with a vengence showing up the people who stole their songs. THis album is reeks of awesomeness. Moongoose has a great voice and lung capacity to hold that note so long at the end of stand up and shout. BUY this album to expirience tru metal.
5,Y2J Chris Jericho can sing!,"WWF Wrestler Chris Jericho sure...can sing. Don't pay attention to the editorial review for this album it is garbage. This is a great cover band, and cover songs from the likes of Dio, Krokus, Twisted Sister, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Ozzy Osbourne, Judas Priest and more. Each and every song is rockin and Fozzy has a great sound put together with the release of this album. My personal favorite on the album is Fozzy's version of ""Eat The Rich"". They are pretty funny too they say how they got trapped in Japan for 20 years and all these bands stole they're songs. Then on one of the pages in the booklet it says .. All Songs Written By Fozzy Except.... and then it lists all of them, haha pretty funny stuff. Definetly check this album out it is well worth it."
5,Fozzy Rocks,"Fozzy is simply awesome. The lead vocals of Chris Jericho, excuse me, Mongoose McQueen, are really great. They are a really good band and have been waiting years to release this record. If you buy one CD this year, make it this one!!"
5,Awesome WWE DVD,"I absolutely love this DVD. I watch the concert DVD all the time. If you Like the HHH DVD and have knowledge of the WWE, you'll defintely like this one b/c it covers his whole career! I defenitely recommend purchasing this DVD!"
5,Brilliant!,Fozzy's first CD is one of the most revolutionary albums ever produced! Not since Mozart and Beethoven has their been an artist like Chris Jericho. Absolute genius! This CD should be bronzed! What a great piece of artwork! Everyone should own this artwork!
2,Rock & Wrestling Connection???,"Wrestler's can't sing!! Let's face it. The is just an 80's cover band who's riding the popularity of WWF wrestler Chris Jerico. Who wants covers of their favorite 80's metal songs when you can have the originals. Jerico and Co. do give a good effort, but on songs like ""Live Wire"", he cannot reach the vocal range that Vince Neil could. ""Stay Hungry"" is a good song, but I prefer the snarl of Dee Snider & Twisted Sister. If your a Jericoholic, then by all means this CD is for you. If your an 80's metal fan, stick with the original artists. Cover bands belong in the club circuit."
5,Funny!!!,"I think Katt Williams is one funny guy. Even though some of his jokes borderline offensive, I think all in all its great humor. Its a good watch if nothing else is on and you are in the mood to laugh."
1,SO disappointed,"I love Katt, but this show was terrible! His jokes were way off base and insulting on a level I couldn't find remotely funny. He kept going on about ""finding faith"" and ""believing in something... anything"" on the brink of 2012. If it was meant to be funny it failed, because it just came across as fearful and paranoid. Katt has always struck me as a relatively informed and intelligent person, but his behavior was erratic and his jokes revealed some highly ignorant views. He continuously broke off in tangents and failed to finish many of his jokes, relying on the audiences affinity for him and their overwhelming applause to fill the silent void where his punchlines should have been. Not his best work. Rent it if you feel you must see it. DO NOT BUY. As a Katt fan, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone... ever."
1,seen it live!,"Went to this show live! When it came through my way he was very slow to get through his jokes and walked off before he finished, do not buy this !!"
4,Funny,"I liked this movie, but it wasn't Katt's best. He was very real and to the point! Funny, but I didn't laugh all the way through."
1,Don't get it,I can't believe I wasted my money I thought it was going to be like all his other shows but this one sucked
4,I like itttt,"Not as good as all other Katt Williams stand up, but it was still pretty funny. I mean, it is Katt Williams. He's funny all the time."
3,Troubled Man,He is an incredably funny man! Wit and wisdom...but you see him hurting now. I'll be praying for the man.
2,yea could do better,"yea it wasn't funny, i mean katt is a naturally funny guy but i did not even finish watching it, made me laugh like once and i was like ahh ok i need to watch something else lol"
3,alright,I watch all of his stand ups and this one wasnt nearly as funny as the rest I laughed a couple times but I wouldnt watch it again like I have all the others
3,Cute not Hillarious,"If you've paid attention to the news, you know that Katt Williams is not what he used to be, that's how I feel about this performance. Where his former performances were, funny, lighthearted,whimsical and inclusive. This performance was devisive, mean spirited, and not too particularly funny. In the past Mr. Williams was hysterically funny, and entertaining but now he seems erratic, and silly. This was interesting, but not entertaining."
3,Not Katt's best,"The reason I'm saying it isn't Katt's best is not because i was offended by any of his jokes (Katt has always pushed the envelope anyway). Jokes about religion/beliefs and race don't really bother me. But I have seen most of his stand-up comedy and Kattpacalypse falls short of most of them. To me this one came off very forced and like Katt was just saying anything for shock value and was trying too hard.There were some parts that were funny but as a whole it was lackluster and I expected it to be much better, and so did many other people. Also I don't know if anyone else has noticed this but Katt is stealing quite a few jokes from other ppl in this DVD, such as Dave Chappelle & Dane Cook. That's where he got many of the atheist jokes, and he stole them almost verbatim. I guess he thought no one would notice but I expected this to be more original & actually be good all the way through but it was average at best."
1,HATED!,"Katt Williams has lost his touch! Loved all of his previous movies but this movie is just horrible and not funny at all! Some parts are just ignorant, he should just give up."
3,Not as funny as his other shows,"Perhaps I'm just Katt'ed out or something. This show didn't seem as funny as his other shows to me, either that or I am just over saturated with his material."
3,"Funny , takes it too far","Katt is hilarious, there is no contesting that!! However I would have liked to see him be a bit more respectful toward various religious beliefs and even lifestyles"
3,Katt I love you but.....,I expected a little more in the comedic realm however it appeared that he was relaying a positive message and not really something hilarious.
1,Drugs have taken their toll on Katt,"Katt is doing too many drugs. Coming on stage looking like Cindy Loo Hoo. His jokes were dull or non-existant. He may be on the cutting edge with his material, but it isn't funny."
4,to each his own...i smiled and laughed,i mostly smiled...thanks for the smiles katt!!! those with poor listening skills and discernment ...please avoid this entertainment and keep it moving. ;-)
4,funny,"As advertised, always funny. His whole demeanor will have u rolling on the floor. I would love to see Katt Williams and Kevin Hart together."
2,eh!,"I was excited to see this, but I was disappointed at the end. Kat Williams is not funny anymore. What happened to him?"
1,there has to be,"other words in his vocabulary than n*&&$%, and there have to be other ways to make a joke than comparing Black people to White people."
2,Katt trippin,"It seemed forced to me. Like he just had to try to be funny for money. Of course, it had some funny parts, but he isn't like he used to be. He might need to quit smoking cause it's damaging his brain for real."
5,Hilarious,"Love Katt as always, always telling it as it is and making us laugh and the stupid every day s*** that most comics overlook. Insightful and intelligent."
1,Very disappointed,I normally think Katt Williams is very funny but this stand up was terrible. I know that his stand up is not one for kids so I am not surprised by anything he says but his whole routine was nothing but GD this and GD that. It was not funny at all. I watched about 15 minutes of it and couldnt stand anymore.
1,This sucks rocks,Katt Williams has lost his edge....he is not funny in the least !!!! he needs to find another line of work
2,Disappointment,"I saw this the other night, and it was a waste of time as the Captain D's I had that night lol...What was up with his hair??? He honestly looked like he was on some serious drugs. Now don't get me wrong, there were some funny parts in it, but it's not the same Katt Williams that everyone has grown to love over the years. It seemed like he just ran out of material or something. I'll say it like this...watch for yourself and you decide. But most of the reviews on this haven't been good, and I'm putting mine into that thumb down pool lol."
1,disappointment,Couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes of the video. His other stand ups are pretty funny but this one was a waste of money.
5,The Best There Is,I started eating Royal cooked dark chocolate pudding in the 1940s and I constantly introduce young folks to it. They all love it as well. In October 2010 my grocer told me the manufacturer discontinued making this product. I truly hope he is wrong. The DARK version of this five-star delight should always be available. I think it is much better than the milk chocolate style.
5,Most outragous,"I been having this as a dessert since the 40's. The cooked pudding is so much betterthen the instant !!! I hope that Royal will bring this product back real soon !!I raised my children and grandchildren on this product and would love to have itback for my great-granchildren ( and me ,too ) !!!!"
5,an album you just gotta hear !,"Buddy Guy - A Man & The Blues, Vanguard Records, 1968Here is ""THE"" template for modern blues inspired performers!. This album is the template for what musicologists refer to as the ""second generation Chicago Blues"". Buddy's performance on his fender Stratocaster will transport you into a smoke filled seedy Chicago bar where the you will get the blues. There are tons of great blues players and albums out there but this one is just kinda extra extra special. One listen and you will know what I mean !"
5,You should know your Zone before you get the book,"This book is really great. I live in Zone 6, but found that some of my best flowers an also thrive in Zones 3 and 4, amazingly. The author does state that trial and error is the best method to go about a shade garden but he also catagorizes the differences between the intensities of shade. Really a great book, lots of information. Will be using it over the winter to choose what I will plant in the Spring."
3,Gardening,"Provides lots of interesting gardening information if you are planting only trees and shrubs. Book does not detail anything for vegetable gardeners. Title should be changed to include the word ""Forestry"" rather than the broad term 'gardening""."
5,You have to really listen to it.,"I listened to this album about five times before I noticed something unusual. The simple songs, the traditional lyrics, the rhythmic guitar, when added up, when listened to with something resembling sensitivity, convey a staggering and intense gentleness and peace. This guy RADIATES peace like some swami or guru. The beauty, though, is that he's not laying any philisophical trip on you. He's just being himself! You can tell that he is really at peace, and listening gives you just a little hint of that same peace in your own soul. He's one of a kind. Thank God for Mississippi John Hurt."
3,"Funny, light reading","This book is funny, but at times you can tell the author is trying too much and stretching a bit. I did enjoy it, but it is not on my top 10 list."
5,"Funny, Funny Book!",I loved this book! It was the first one I've read by Celia Rivenbark. It took me one day to read it. I couldn't put it down. My favorite chapter? Revenge of the Amish Friendship Bread!!! I can't wait to read her other book!
2,Just Fluff,"If you are looking for an easy read with some humor, this is the story for you. I had never read one of her books before and we picked it for book club, not knowing much about it. There were a couple of laugh out loud parts, but overall, not much to talk about."
2,Slightly Funny...,This reads like a collection of weekly columns published on a run of slow news days in a middle-sized Southern daily newspaper. I know...'cause I wrote 'em myself back in the late '60s.
1,My Internal Feminist Blanched...,"and then threw up.While a few of the mini-essays were entertaining, most left me hoping there are women out there who aren't obsessed with ER reruns and ""chawing"" ""nabs"" on the way to the Wal-Mart wearing sweat pants and trying to one-up other moms while shoveling high-fructose corn syrup into her own rugrat."
1,Book only belongs on shelves in Cracker Barrel,"No merit to the writings what so ever. This is one of those passing through the South, let's get Uncle Markie a laughing book gift. Which, Uncle Markie, or whoever, will never read, and it will end up either in the trash bin, or some Salvation Army store.The books is a bunch of vignettes about the South, but poorly written. Good bathroom reading I guess."
1,I can't find the book,I can't find this book any where not even in used book stores.HELP! I loved her second book.
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I love my southern roots, and some of these short pieces were good, but most were just OK. I didn't hate it, I just didn't love it."
3,"Super easy read, maybe too easy?","I am a huge Chelsea Handler fan, but she doesn't write as fast as I read so my friend and I decided to try out Celia. It wasn't a disapointment, but I haven't 100% decided if I will buy any other books. I'm not sure if I like the 1-2 page essays or not, on one hand I liked that I could get a few pages in and be done with the story and get to bed but on the other I sometimes didn't feel like she gave enough info and the story ended and I was very confused. I do love the way she writes the southern drawl and refers to her child as ""The Toddler"". A peak into ""The Hillbilly South"" was laughable for the most part, but being from the north, I didn't totally get everything she wrote about. In the end, it was super easy to read and somewhat comical and after a full day with 2 year old twins that exactly what I need."
4,A Must-Read For The Southern Transplant,"In this book, Ms. Rivenbark dissects the social banter and behavior of the average southern population. It seems that Southerners are the ultimate put-down artists. A remark that seems complimentary and pleasant to the unitiated may well be considered an insult by the local folks. I can see that this would be a plus when confronted with the multitude of transplants that have moved south. This book is TOO funny, as well as informative."
4,amusing essay collection,"This amusing essay collection focuses on the southern perspective and home life. The book is broken into three categories: ""At Home"", ""The South"", ""And Everywhere Else"". The contributions are lighthearted amusing and fun to read as a variety of subjects from mama tips to spiked NASA Tang to Wrestlemania are shredded and diced like slaw at a fad diet explosion. Nothing is sacred though nothing is totally gored not even Al. From family recipes to the Rock and his wife Dr. Ms. Rock on to Adam West, Celia Rivenbark provides the below the Mason-Dixon demarcation line but above the Mickey Mouse border look at life. If you have to ask who Adam West is, you're probably too young for this sassy slice of Southern sympathy served with ice tea but no grits.Harriet Klausner"
5,this cd is the da bomb!,"Dieselboy has really outdone himself this time, I feel that his choice of tracks is incredible, the intro and all, once you find yourself arriving at track 4 you know from then on it is on. Big Ups, and all that good stuff, because this is what drum n' bass is about."
4,"great, but not his best","I bought this cd first of diesalboys(yeah, i came on to the scene a LITTLE late) and I loved it... then I went and bought 97Octane, and I realized that the sixth session is only second rate...not that it's not fast, fun, adrenaline pumping and flawlessly mixed, it's just that the track selection is a little repetative. This is okay at a show, because you're dancing too much to even notice, so long as the music keeps up. Buy this cd if you're into Drum and Bass(jungle for those that refuse to let the term die) it's also nice ear candy if you want to listen, but the pure genius lies in 97Octane, go buy that first, then come back to the sixth session."
2,"No fun, repetitive and uninteresting","Why is Dieselboy such a DnB stud? I'd rather hear the creativity of Metalheadz any day. This is just derivitive, with no subtlety, and a totally uninspired mix. Spend your money on something else. I will admit, though, that it is HARD!"
2,Writing in response to someones review of Plug's Drum'n'bass,"Recently I was reading reviews of Plug's ""dum'n'bass for papa"" on this website and many of the bad reviews it recieved was from people saying that photek and dieselboy are better. There is a huge difference between the two. I listened to this album expecting something new with jungle/drum and bass, but came to find no such thing. The beat, ""techstep"", is probably the most passe and boring beat I have ever heard. This album is repetitious nad boring and doesn't bring anything new to the scene like Plug's album did when it came out. There isn't much else to say. If you like going to raves and enjoy the jungle room, buy this CD. If you like IDM, or something new, steer far away from this. Ed Rush and optical have done far better"
1,An audio insult,"1 star is too much. This is my first Dieselboy album and I have to say, looking at the cover from ""the no. 1 DnB artist"", I expected to find some top notch drum'n'bass. What I got is 193 beats per minute with no soul, no flavah, no personality, nothing. 70+ minutes of audio garbage. Skip it. I *highly* recommend LTJ Bukem's 'Logical Progression: level 1' for an experience of DnB the way it ought to be."
2,"Marginally Okay, But Not as Good as the Rest","I have System Upgrade, Dungeonmaster's Guide, and Project Human, and this one just doesn't live up to the standards set by the other discs. Don't get me wrong - it's listenable. But you will enjoy any of the other titles I mentioned much, MUCH more."
4,Great Spray Paint for Plastics,"I purchased this product to change the color of the faceplate of a DVD optical drive for my wife's computer.The original color of the drive was black, and I used this spray to turn it white. It worked great.Pros: Dries fast / Black to White in just a few thin coats / Preserved detail of raised print on driveCons: Turned the smooth surface of the CD tray into a bit of a rough surface / Not as glossy as expectedOverall, worked great, and I'd buy it again."
1,Rust-Oleum 1911830 Vinyl spray Paint,"Produst terrible. Paint started to ""spit"" from the nozzle about 25% of the way through the can.By half way it stopped spraying altogether. Tossed the product and bought something that worked."
3,"Read the description, people","This is an ad for 5000 of these products. One costs $20, and you can buy 5000 of them for this price on Amazon for $300+. It's actually a good deal, but what I can't get is... who needs 5000 of them?"
1,Is it real?,"On the box - retail price $19.99List price $99,950Weight 18 lbs (add this to your cell phone)Does Amazon look at this????"
5,Just what you need,"Having had Aladar as a fencing coach, I can say that he definitely knows what he's talking about. In fencing, one's muscles tend to develop unevenly (the front arm and leg work harder than the others) and yoga helps even them out and keep you balanced. It is also a good practice to come down from the athletic high that you can get after competition. The mindful practice of these exercises keeps you balanced as an athlete, as well as a person."
5,Fun series,"I have found all of the books in this series a good quick read and fun. Admittedly, I love vampire stories and this series is no exception.The characters are fun without being too deep, the 'cases' are not bad, and taken altogether an enjoyable read."
3,Love the series,"Vampire P.I., former journalist, Jack Fleming continues his adventures. This time, he and his friend Escott solve murders in the art community. It seemed a bit weaker than the earlier books and perhaps the art mystery genre was feeling overdone to me. So I enjoyed the continuing story between Jack and his girlfriend Bobbi, but not the mystery much this time."
3,2-Wire Sensor does not fit 2001 Prius,"I bought this part based on Amazon's Fit Chart that stated it would fit a 2001 Prius. This is a two-wire sensor. The Prius takes a four-wire sensor, and the part would not fit. The vendor (Autoparts123) accepted the return with a refund. Amazon should update the Fit Chart."
3,Help producing scientific papers,"Scientific workplace is a good software for producing scientific papers. Usually, I used Latex to type papers, but the ability of this software can make the process easier. The limitation of the software is its disability to import some styles easily. For example, to publish in IEEE journal, we need to use IEEE style which might not be listed in the software. The options are to find the specific style that will be provided by scientific workplace somewhere in the web. If we are lucky, then we can get it easily. But, sometimes, we also need to follow some other publisher's format, such as lecture notes in computer science which currently is not supported (yet). In this case, we will have a problem on converting the style according that the one that is asked."
2,Not good...,"...too thin, harsh on hands, not a good value on a per-sheet basis. Stick with Bounty and other brand-names."
2,Not as described,"The description says ""Eating Bib Set includes 1 large polka dots bib and 1 small polka dots bib.""I purchased this last week and got it yesterday. It only came with 1 bib - the large polka dots. So that description is inaccurate. Luckily I only paid $5.99 from the Baby Deal of the Day. I would have been even more mad if I had paid $9.99 and only received 1 bib!The bib itself is OK though. Nice pattern."
3,picture is misleading,"Only got one bib, not 2 as in photo, or in description (one big, one small). Amazon should edit the description. it's misleading."
4,Pleasant Read,"This was a short and pleasant read. Private Investigator Kenneth Gunn is working on a case for his friend when he is beat up and dumped in a greenhouse. When Daisy comes to investigate the noise she hears in the middle of the night, she is shock to find a man knocked out. When he comes to he has no idea who he is and how he got to Daisy's Rose and Garden shop.Throughout the book Daisy and John Doe(Kenneth) try to find out who he is and what he is doing in Guthrie, Oklahoma. In the process the begin to fall in love with each other.There is not a lot of romance between the couple. But this is a very enjoyable read."
2,Nice high level Web Services over view,"I'm buying web services books like mad it seems. This book is nicely written, OK authority and accuracy (given the 2 book or sobook back ground I have so far) but ZERO code. Not one line of java, C++or fortran. No mention of real frameworks (besides .Net by name only).How can a book be titled Understanding (any thing) and have no realworking examples, deployable components, downloadable web services based on some framework.Forget this book unless you're looking for a very high level understanding of the associated XML specs and architecture. You'll not hear about the Apache Axis project, substantive implementation details of .Net or any other framework in this book.My quest for one or two good books that cover real commercial quality design, patterns and code goes on."
2,A lot of understandble and useless paragraphs,"We bought this book trying to find a good overview about what web-service implementation is, what WSDL means what RPC/Document style means, etc, by an expert point of view, I must say at least this is not the case.There are a lot of paragraphs with useless information, that in the first read you avoid because you don't understand, in the next reads you avoid because they are useless.Terms are confusing and mixed up, explanations also.If you like skipping paragraphs it is a good newbie introduction, if you have some background on web-service just avoid it.Really disappointing"
3,Pretty good overview,This book provides a pretty good overview of web services--although it's a little heavy handed with xml. Bottom line is that i6t would be easy to wal away from this book thinking web services is simply xml schema--and miss the bigger picture.
1,Must be a Programmer to Understand this book,"You must have a very good understanding of XML, WSDL, SOAP, AND UDDI and html code. The book explains everything from the point of view of a programmer/developer."
3,Good for Introduction at Leisure!,"Well, I bought this book thinking that it would get me started with developing web services, apart from just introducing them.Though it does a pretty good job of introducing them, its the getting-you-started-with-development part that it fails to impress. Probably it just isn't designed to do that.So if you want to read an introductory text on web-services at leisure, this book is a good choice. Its written in a very comprehensible style and I had no problems understanding the key concepts.However, as is true with any other XML based technology, unless you get some hands on experience with the whole framework, you don't really feel that you are ready to begin professional work as yet. And since XML-based frameworks are usually very detailed and intimidating at first, real-time experience becomes all the more important. I guess now I need to buy another book that'll help me with actual development of web-services ."
4,Good Introduction on Web services.,"An excellent book for any business or IT executive that really needs to understand the concepts and implications of Web services. For those who need to appreciate how this technology will impact their business environment and strategic direction, but are not about to sit down and start writing the code using .NET or Java !"
4,Very informative.,This is a great small group study book fot churches looking to grow and not become a statistic. There are quite a few graphs explaining the authors point. This book was very helpful to the members of our leadership commitee in our church. We used and continue to use it as reference points of conversation on ways to improove our church makeup. Even though we are now an extremly small church we are on the grow . Not just because of this book but because we were using a great deal of this books sugestions before we ever started using it. I would highly recomend this book to anyone involved in church leadership.
5,bach transcriptoins,C'est un enregistrement veritablement genial. Quelle musique!! Plus jamais un disque ne pourra faire aimer la musique de Bach comme a... A se procurer immediatement.
5,Good sandals!,"I wanted a good sandal I could invest in. The velcro straps help to stabilize your foot on the sandal, once you go through adjusting them all. I have a higher arch, and this sandal doesn't quite accomodate it, but I get by with them just the same. These shoes really help cushion the imapact of walking on the streets and sidewalks. That's a major plus that I wanted to point out. I would recommend these sandals."
2,Retro UNCHIC,"Looks can be deceiving. The breadbox looks cool in the picture but when you get it home it just doesn't jive with the rest of the kitchen. Also, it was poorly designed as you can't open the breadbox without it sliding around all over the counter (the feet of the box are metal, have no traction and can scratch your countertops)"
3,Good introduction of SQL server 7.0,"I totally agree with one of the reviewers. This book covers everything but definitely not a how-to book. Read it if you need to have a snapshot of SQL server 7.0. If you look for a training book (for MCDBA), look elsewhere."
2,"""ADMINISTRATING SQL Server 7.0""","I found the publishers synopsis, and espcially the book's title to be very misleading! USING SQL Server 7.0 . . . it is not! The authors start out with ""This book is written for IT professionals who want to learn how to administer SQL Server 7"" in the introduction, and in chapter one they point out it is for those who want to become a SQL Server Database Administrator (DBA). ""Using"" SQL Server 7.0 implies to me a totally different view point. I was looking for something in an introductry guide for ""users"", and developers, to compliment my higher-level SQL Server Programming manual. Instead I found it is an introductry DBA manual. Even in itself, this is contradictory, as prospective DBA's require ""in-depth"" knowledge that this book is lacking."
1,Made in China,"Previously made in Europe, later the USA, but now made in China. The taste and smell are not what it used to be."
3,Maggi,"It is good, but I was expecting the Maggi from Germany. My fault, I didn't read close enough. Still very good, just not from Europe."
3,Soy sauce?,"I do not have a sharpened palette, but ""Maggi Seasoning"" just seems to be a European name for Soy Sauce. I wish I'd known that before ordering. But now I know."
5,An amazing product,"I love this stuff. It smells fantastic and immediately gets rid of the odors from the diaper pail (I cloth diaper), the litter boxes, and my husband ;). I have no idea how this company makes any money though; I use it multiple times a day and one can still lasts for over a year (it says 3000 sprays on the label and they aren't kidding)."
1,Very bad company!,"I paid over $200 for this product and have owned it for over a year. It stopped working altogether. No music, no nothing. So what will the company do about that?... nothing! By checking their website, I have found out that after 60 days of use of the product, they charge $12.99 just to talk to you about any problem. So I sent them an e-mail instead. Their website said they would respond for free. Four days later... no response. So what to do?... throw the $200 product away and buy a new one or pay them their $12.99 just to ask them what if anything I can do? The Creative company sucks big time and should be avoided."
2,It's great.....while it lasts,"Ive only had one for three months and within these three months I've met the end of the Creative Zen Micro. The Sound quality is really good, the navigation touch feature is a bit too sensitive even on the lowest settings. The device does a great job...that is until you by some accident drop it, ITS ALL OVER!I had it drop to the floor from 10 inches and the entire unit froze, I had tried to fix it but nothing $150.00 right out of the window. A BIG let down that this unit is very fragile, you drop it once and you can say good bye to your Zen Micro.It's great....while it lasts, the price is a bit too high(EVEN USED PRICES) and there are better products than this one like the Sansa e200 mp3 player. Don't pay for something that can break faster than you took trying to pay for it."
3,Great sound...poor battery life....,"Great sound on this sleek Micro Mp3. However the battery charge is poor... it only last a little over 3 hrs of playing your favorite tunes. Then it shuts off.The AC chargers sold here are not comparable...I already bought 2 and they did not work. I'll have to buy the creative charger connector. Should have bought them in the first place, would have avoided all theseextra$$$$$ cost."
2,I need the Books I Ordered 30 July 2010,"I ordered two copies of this book on or about 30 July 2010 from one of your consignment dealers who's star rating was at 94%. I read several of the reviews and most were very complimentary of the order process, time involved, and condition upon receipt. I clicked that these reviews assisted me in selecting the company (who I can't remember now. I received emails saying the products had been shipped and were on the way. I have not seen hide nor hair of anything since.I would appreciate it if you could advise and let me know. Thank You"
1,"HORRIBLE, PLEASE BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS","I don't honestly care if this review is helpful or not, but I must stress out the fact that the bad reviews for this phone are definitely true. Bad battery life, bad reception (or NO reception), awful design, small but not exactly to its advantage (too small of buttons - no I don't have fat hands) So yeah, don't get this phone."
1,Utter Garbage,"Clearly the worst cell phone if not the worst designed piece of electronics I have ever had the misfortune to own. Very flimsy, very poor battery life, multiple software glitches, losing addresses, losing appointments, turning off randomly, very poor reception, unable to send text messages."
4,"Great phone, love the size, but a bit overpriced!","This is the smallest Nextel phone I've ever owned and I really like it overall. The bronze design is cool and really gets attention. The features are all pretty good. What I don't like is that the battery hardly lasts a day and it's a bit overpriced compared to other phones from other carriers. But, it's the best option for Nextel!"
1,Garbage,My daughter has owned almost every phone Nextel has made and this was by far the worse. It was broken more often than not. Thank God I purchased the additional insurance on it or I would have gone into bankruptcy just trying to keep it working. She finally sent it to the cell phone cemetery where it belonged. Nextel needs to make another updated verson of the i95. That was the best phone they ever made.
3,So So...,I just received my i830 in the mail on Monday and so far I am very satisfied with the service BUT my biggest issue is the lame battery life. This morning I took my phone off the charger around 9:30 an dby 1:30 I had lost one bar of battery life. Other than that the phone and service is pretty good but not good enough for me to recommend this phone without some sort of extended battery life.
2,If you want to waste your money this is the phone for you!,"I originally wanted a compact phone that looked great and had great service. So when I gor my i830 from Nextel's site I was extremely happy because it was all I expected and more until I started using it. The battery life is terrible. The exterior is SO SENSATIVE that the first day that I had it...it was scrached and dented. It is made of aluminum and is destroyed just like aluminum. So your phone quickly begins to look very badly very quickly. If you are a man then this is not the phone for you. The buttons are very small and should give you alot of problems just to dial a number without error. In case you don't get the drift, you need to look into another phone if you want a good quality phone all around."
2,Phone has lots of problems,"Have had this phone for a year, the screen to the earpiece fell out. This happened to a co-worker too but Nextel would not fix it without a hefty price. The battery won't keep a charge after a year either. The size and design is good but the problems need to be fixed."
3,Motorola i830,This is a very compact phone loaded with good features. Size is the best feature but Motorola gave up battery performance for it. If you use the compact battery that is included with the phone you get about 30 minutes of talk time before it goes dead. You can buy a regular size battery and that only increases talk time to about 1 hour. You need to charge this phone constantly which for me is a big negitive.
2,This phone stinks compared to the i860,"all i can say is if you get this phone you must realize that a smaller phone means smaller battery. the battery life is horible on this phone. it never made it past 1 whole day. the other things that i did not like about this phone is that it has a tiny screen & the metal cover gets scratched very easily. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE, GO GET THE i860 BECAUSE THAT PHONE ROCKS!!!"
5,"Hurry Thor, run fetch Donny Most!","At last, the American writer who appreciates Ralph Malph as the American writer should of the humor!This is story of governor-elect (in the matter of insanity) Dev Degraw and four dogs, the wiener dogs of torment meeting the eerie parallel of the (late, great) Thor (now fetching Pa in heaven!) and his not-pale imitative descendent, Comet, who may be the title dog.I quote ""may be"" title dog, for is Dev Degraw not the symbolic title dog of himself? Why the D here, and why the D there? Perhaps Dev's name should be Dog Dog to make Biminim's d-light complete?For Dev is a dog as surely as man is a dog and as surely as Inman Majors is genius!Must not man be dog to run for the Head of the Heart of Dixie? Can you not see George Wallace as wiener dog #1 and Fob James as wiener dog #2?All hail again Inman Majors (I.M. yall), and may you not fill your threesome with Bunny Akins and Odelle Bailey!"
5,Changing forms,"Mr. Grossman's last novel should change our reading habits: despite its - at firts glance - strange and complex structure, it is a story about how we deny the right to the past to be more than a parallax effect. It engraves our so-called linearity in an ever-changing form, in order to open our eyes: the world is made of voices, and each voice creates its own world. To enter these worlds, one has to be stripped naked of all conventions. This is a great novel, for all those who read Vollmann, Danielewski, D. Cooper."
4,T.B.O.L. is three quarters intrigue and one quarter ramble.,"Grossman's The Book of Lazarus follows a subverted pattern of character surround, in which Grossman forces the reader into a superb spectral analysis of how each character will eventually fall prey to the sinister underworld connections of Mitchell O'Banion. O'Banion's daughter, a compelling character who leads the reader through a maze of political and intelligence countermands, becomes one of the last connected characters to perish. But her legacy and the path to get there create a unique and fresh contemporary novel, whose photographic reminisces to the dead (the actual book of Lazarus)fit well into the novel's scenic and dark forms. If not for a somewhat unrelated and stupendously unending political ramble at the end, this novel would own an integrity one rarely finds in contemporary novels."
5,Discover Amos,"This was the first album where I heard the great Amos Garrett. Check out his amazing licks in Honey and the groove he creates in Tin Can Alley Parts I and II. Amos went on to play incredible solos and back up with Geoff and Maria Muldaur on their duet and solo albums, Ian & Sylvia, Paul Butterfield, and Jesse Winchester. But this was a revelation when I heard it back in the 60s. Inspiring. Of course Eric Andersen is great too with a band or without one. In addition to this early Vanguard experiment with folk rock, Eric recorded a curious second-take slightly folk rockish version of his classic 'Bout Changes and Things."
3,Andersen is more interesting than the author,"I kept going with this book, because the quotes from Andersen's book and from Andersen's diaries were interesting, and the author writing about Andersen was also interesting. The author writing about himself, and his humor became a bit tiresome to me, sorry to say, and I skimmed a bit, towards the end."
4,Mixes fit for royalty!,"Bebel Gilberto, daughter of Joo Gilberto (Brazil's best-loved musical son and one of the creators of the bossanova style of jazz), is creating a worldwide stir of her own as she brings bossa style and substance into the 21st century. If you haven't heard her the album Tanto Tempo, from which the original version of ""Sem Conteno"" is taken, go do so and then come back. You'll like it.Back now? Nice classy mixes befitting a member of the bossanova royalty. The One Rascal Remix takes the original and grafts it onto the New York House DNA strand. The Ugo & Sanz Remix takes a more Ibiza-styled approach to the track, but both are pure dance floor. The acapella track is beautiful but useful only for club mixing."
4,k.n.d rules,this toy is pretty good but the figures are small and easy to lose plus they are not able to change positions at all
2,Time Bomb 2000: Don't Bother,"While the Yourdans clearly expended a great deal of effort in coming up with - and then naming - some of the many disasters potentially caused by the Y2K problem, it's something my morbid imagination can do on its own. I was looking for a technical explaination of the problem, how it happened, why it hasn't been fixed... I was NOT looking for a laundry list of disasters great and small. The appendix, however, wasn't bad; I think it starts around page 314."
2,Too repetitive and boring,"While this book does ofer a substantial amount of insight into the Y2K crisis, it repeats much of the information over and over again. I could not sit down and read the book for a long period of time, as the information given is boring. This book did not add anything to what I already knew about the Y2K crisis. I hope other authors will offer a better selection regarding this subject."
4,"Well balanced, thorough, factual presentation on Y2K.","This book is ""low key"" on the sensation meter. It is a thoughtful exploration of the facts and a conservative appraisal of the possible impact of Y2K. This will get you to think seriously about Y2K! It might be best to read Appendix A and B before getting into the regular chapters. My one complaint is that ""Programmers"" are elevated on some pedestal that they don't belong on (I'm a programmer!) Anyway, it's well worth reading."
1,"Slow, cumbersomes and boring presentation","Frankly, I was very disappointed. The book was difficult to read and hard to follow. Several times throughout I felt that information was restated over and over, not for clarity, but to fill pages. Much of the book was too boring to read through completely. This book was written so poorly as to cast a doubt on the validity of the potential problem it is trying to report on? I wish I had not purchased this book and could get my money back. There are probably better books out there which explain the Y2K problem."
1,Dreck,I was roaming around in my local public library and came across this schlock. After reading the introduction all I can say is I'm glad I did not pay my not so hard earned money for it.
1,Doom and Gloom,"Doom and Gloom. If that is what you want to read about buy this book. This has got to be one of the most boring books to read. I found my self skipping entire chapters due to the feeling that I had read it earlier in the book. As of the substance of what I read, I feel that the author was looking for a way to cash in on the Y2K hype and make some easy money at expense of scaring others. I have been working on computers for over 13 years and have recently been involved in Y2K testing at a large company. After setting back the clocks on 23 servers, 400 workstations and abut a 100 supporting switches, hubs, routers and printers we found had no problems with operations. The equipment that we found that did not roll over still worked with no interruptions and only need a flash upgrade for reporting reasons only."
3,Almost as good as The Survivor's Guide to The Year 2000,Tough slogging through this one with all the possible and imagined scenarios one could dream up. But it is good to have an idea what might be ahead. As I was looking for more information on the future of the markets and investing I enjoyed The Survivor's Guide more. Read both for a well rounded picture if you have the time. If you only have an hour or two pick The Survivor's Guide.
3,Good but long.,"A valuable resource yet I've found myself skipping through this book and reading parts and pieces - like a dictionary. Although the information was good, it was kinda of long. (400+ pages is a lot when you have things to do!)I later read ""Panic Now!"" and found it easier, quicker, and actually enjoyable.I heard that Yourdon is making a revised Time Bomb 2000. I hope that it would be edited down a bit for us folks who don't have a lot of time."
3,At least it's not alarmist.,"I suppose the focus of the book was just to make people aware of the possible scenarios of the Y2K situation. In that respect the book deserves 5 stars, however, it's just another book about the hottest topic. Nothing original here."
3,Informative overview with emphasis on finance,"I found myself ""skim"" reading through many sections to get to the ""meat"" of what was being said. Having read numerous articles and other books on the topic, I found this one to be only a little above average (there are better.) It did have some additional facts I had not previously seen, but I believe the author's conclusions are clouded by their residence in, and perhaps, reluctance to leave Manhattan. It is worth the time to go through this book, but not to read it only on this topic."
1,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice. . .","Credit to Ed Yourdon for inventing a new literary niche --pointing out a nonexistent crisis, writing a book about it, then writing another book debunking it! He hasn't, at the time of this review, written a book celebrating victory over the fearmongering that he helped to spark, but I'm certain it will be forthcoming.Yourdon's last shred of credibility evaporated on 01/01/00. Hopefully he made enough off this book to retire. If he didn't, he's going to need to find a new line of work."
1,Wild sensationalism,"Mr. Yourdon should stick to fields that he knows something about. His lack of knowledge and sound research in control systems, infrastructure, economics and many business functions are evident."
1,Put this book in a museum!,"This book belongs in a museum of ""Historical Curiosities"", along with Piltdown Man and sea monkeys. The only place for Amazon to put this book would be in the humor section, considering the outrageous ""chicken little"" predictions of Yourdon and his kind. Ed Yourdon, Gary North, and all the other Y2K nuts are frauds and demagogues, and I am sure it will only be a matter of time before they concoct some new doomsday scheme. I guess they'll find some way to postpone the Apocalypse until their feverish little brains go into overdrive again.Happy new millennium, everyone!"
5,Expand your mind and possiblities...,"Having purchased many of Mr. Farrand's previous works direct from his website in the past, the inclusion of new, expanded audio works on the practice of Sanskrit Japa has greatly improved my understanding and retention of this ancient Yogic practice. Learn to manifest powerful change in your life through this beautiful daily practice. Namaste'...Hari Om."
3,Not a beginning logic student's book,"Of course I didn't see the author's preface: ""Although this is a book about Frege's logic, it is not a work of logic in any standard sense....My aim is rather to develop a novel reading of Frege's logical language...."" With this in mind the title of her book should have been ""Frege's logic: an examination of his notation."" I'm a third of the way in and all I get is information on Frege's bizarre logic notation. I'm no scholar of logic. I want to understand Frege's logic as it relates to his contribution to the development of symbolic logic over the years. I wanted to know a bit about his influence on Godel and such. One book I have says that although Russell found a problem in Frege's work, which Frege found totally demoralizing, there are various ""fixes"" for what they call the Russell Antimony. Okay, what are these ""fixes""? I won't find out in this book, I'm sure."
1,This man knows nothing about playing the bagpipes,"This is a classic situation of someone who doesn't know how to play the bagpipes claiming that they do. Piping is a centuries old artform that takes years of study to play even at a novice level. Harley's bagpipes are painfully out of tune and he obviously has no knowledge of the cultural tradition that proper piping demands. I could just pick up a sax and blow it about jazz clubs and claim to ""have my own style man."" But I would still suck like a hoover. The reason that I am so unhappy about this album is because people who do not know better will think that bagpipes sound awful if this is their only exposure to them. I have played bagpipes since I was (...)and I have been making pipes for 4 years. Please, if you want to hear bagpipes look up ""gordon duncan"", ""Victoria Police Pipe Band"", or ""Angus McColl"", just to name a few."
4,"Fits good, but","The valve assy fit but the pump still leaks from the pump head area. The other rubber part had a leak it it and it is more expensive. Also, the other rubber part is more likely to leak since it is flexed by the pumping action. I had to take the pump apart to see this. I bought a new pump."
5,Many Uses for the Arepa Maker,"I have found that the Arepa Maker can be used for many things besides Arepas. It can be used to make Eggs,Hamburgers,Pancakes, Crab Cakes, Tuna Melt, Salmon Croquettes, Shortcake, Potato Cakes/Hash Browns,Circle Sandwiches - Kids will love to eat! Anything you can image.....And also one trick, when you make the arepas, you can open them and scoop the inside and fill them with anything you can image....from ground meat, shredded meat to cheese, eggs...etc...That is how the real Venezuelans eat them.....!!!"
4,Arepamaker - Dorayaki maker,I use this to make Dorayaki (Japanese pancake filled with sweet red beans) It works pretty good but you have to be fast because the bottom cooks quickly so I just close the lid for a few minutes then flip the cakes & cook with the lid open to even the sides up.
5,The perfect arepa maker,My family loves the new arepa maker. It cooks arepas faster than using the grill and works perfect. I love it. The arepa maker only takes a few tries (adjusting the timer) to cook the arepas to perfection. My daughters can easily make them and is quick and ready to eat. It is also easy to clean! I'd recommend the Arepamaker to anyone who loves arepas. Arrived on time and in excellent condition. This seller was super to order from.
5,Arepa maker,"For anyone who loves arepas, but hates to spend the time to brown them and then bake them, this machine cuts the time in half, and turns out a beautiful product. It will bake them to your shade of brown."
2,I don't recomend it,Very poor quality. The closing device broke the first time I use it.Oster.I don't recomend it.
3,Metal St. Francis medal,"The quality of this item is ok, but I was a little bothered to see that on the reverse side was an image of St. Anthony! This should have been initially disclosed, as it was kind of a odd surprise for someone ordering a St. Francis medal."
3,Not so great,"I felt this 4 CD set was not a good representation of what Elvis has done at Vegas. A number of songs were repeated when other material could have been included instead. The fourth CD was poor quality and really shouldnt have been included. Many of those songs are available in better quality from other Vegas shows and should have been used. Its a 4 CD set which should really have been a 2 CD set.Individual concert CDs are probably a better bet.Besides all that, the man is a genius and a total pleasure to listen to. The live material is simply excellent."
5,Good stuff,"This is set quite expensive and not for the faint of pocketbook. I bought mine at the local store for a little over sixty five bucks. Well worth it however. Disk 4 starts out with some songs from Elvis' first set of shows in Vegas in 1956. The audio quality is from that era, but a fine job has been done ""cleaning it up"" without losing anything in the process. However the rest of the disk is the same way, even though the songs were recorded in 1974 and 1975. Hard to figure out why the audio quality is shoddy with these more recently recorded songs. I really wanted a ""clean"" live copy of Promised Land.Other than the mystery of the sound quality on disk four, this is a straight forward boxed set. Presley really knew how to put on a live show. I'm glad these songs were captured on tape. Great photos in the liner booklet."
2,Completely Redundant and Unnecessary Release!,"If you Elvis fans have the albums ELVIS IN PERSON AT THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, ON STAGE FEBRUARY 1970, WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES-THE ESSENTIAL 70S MASTERS, THAT'S THE WAY IT IS SPECIAL EDITION, then you pretty much have this box set already! The performances are almost exactly the same as those that Elvis gives on those records, so why bother? There are some nice performances from mid-70's Vegas shows on Disc 4, but these so closely resemble the studio releases that this box set is almost completely redundant! If you have the CDs mentioned above, you are not missing anything! Only for the Elvis completist who has to have EVERY unreleased performance (I am not one of them). Still, the 2 star rating was for the idea--I must admit, the performances are great!"
5,Review for Elvis?,"Come on, if you have to read the review section then you are not a true Elvis fan. This set, like every other box set-past, present, & future-is AWESOME. If it is a true BMG/RCA Elvis Presley label, then trust that it will be a great addition to any collection."
5,Next Big Star,"When I first seen Jodi perform at the local radio station concert they put together one summer, I couldn't believe that she was from here in Des Moines. She was lined up with names like Lila McCann, Neil McCoy, and Andy Griggs! I bought her CD after I left the concert and I instantly knew she would make it big. I'll support her in whatever she has to do to make it big, shes real talent, and shes a corn-fed Iowan !"
2,Overpriced and hard!,"Although the picture is pretty, I think this product is overpriced. It is also hard to assemble because the pieces are almost the same. typically, there are 4 or 5 kinds of pieces shape in a jigsaw puzzle. But for this one, there's only two. The sky and the river was the hardest part to finish. we needed to guess because its impossible to determine w/c piece fits because the pieces are very similar..."
5,"Excellent, small, MiniDV Camcorder.","The GR-DX300U is the ideal size for outdoor enthusiasts. The camera is small, light and fits perfectly in a backpack or pocket. Despite its size, the 3 inch LCD screen is beautiful, but the viewfinder is easier to use in bright, sunny conditions (unfortunately the viewfinder is B/W). Battery life is dismal and you will need to purchase a backup battery (1 hour at best). Digital still pictures are fair and still do not seem to be as clear or vibrant as those taken by an actual digital camera (I rarely use the camera for stills). However, video quality is excellent and footage is easily transferred to your computer through the fire-wire port (using Windows ME and IE-1339 card and cable). With the correct software, DVD editing and creation is a blast! I have also used the JVC GR-DVM76U and am very pleased with JVC's quality and performance."
3,"too much not about the subject, and too short","after I bought it I found out it is ONLY 26 MINUTES LONG. I paid $20 for that? Plus a lot of the information didn't show much of the general anatomy of the body. A lot of the ""teaching"" was just told by a woman that was dressed nicely and laid accross a couch. I was more distracted by her anatomy tahn learning about it."
1,From manuscript to hardcopy: What Went Wrong?!,"Interesting aspect of America that just about anyone can get just about anything published, no matter how incrededibly irrelevant it might be. It's difficult getting past the source for this books information: a previously non-published Dentist with a Phd in pharmacology teaching in Southern California. But I digress, this book serves only to point out the authors lack of knowledge on this subject. It bounces from barely connectable era's in this nations history. Hmmm I live near this man... hmm I go meet him... he has had the a most priveledged upbringing void of any real challenges. I left feeling that ""Dr."" Trapp is in search of 15 minutes, prior to acknowleging his own life was, well, ho hum."
3,not high enough,not high enough to be placed on carpet. other than that works like it should and holds the doors in place.
5,Simply the best and greatest soccer coaching manual!,"I have played soccer for many years and this book would enable many coaches and players to better understand each others roles so much better. This level of understanding takes many years to develope. This book could really help to simplify that process. This book takes sun tzu's principles and applies them to soccer.In the business and martial arts communities,it has always been said that these principles are applicable to all times and places where people compete against each other.Thus this interpretation can be made applicable to basketball, hockey ,etc - ALL SPORTS."
5,"Content & theory excellent, pictures & diagrams not as good","This is my current favorite book on soccer.The quotes from Sun Tzu (The Art of War) are very appropriate. The book goes from the very general, a thorough discussion of space and its importance in war and on the pitch, to the very specific.Catlin concentrates much more on the concept of roles as opposed to positions. When teams recognize that functional roles are much more important than positions and when the team members learn that they should be interchangable, the dynamics of play can become much more interesting.Also helpful is the fact that the most important points are clearly highlighted, making it easy to focus on each of them as a teaching point.I have developed a fairly large soccer library, and this book, even with its flaws, is one of the best. Clif Brittain"
3,"Insightful, but unfocused and overlong","There are some good insights in this book (and some really nice pictures). However, I was put off by the author's tone, which is pedantic and mildly condescending, and I was unimpressed by his grocery-list application of the insights to the game. The Sun Tzu quotes were appropriate but gratuitous, and the author does not apply the simplicity which has made ""Art of War"" such a classic. Where ""The Art of War"" is about fifty pages (including third-party commentary), ""The Art of Soccer"" is about four times that length.Brevity would have greatly improved this book. The real insights (primarily regarding the importance of using space in effective soccer) were covered fully in the first chapter or two; the details in the later part are covered more eloquently and carefully in other works (see ""Coaching Soccer Successfully,"" by Roy Rees et al ...For an intermediate coach or player this book could be quite helpful, but I suggest skimming rather than reading it."
5,Excellent Book on soccer theory,"This is an excellent book that helps develop a greater appreciation and understanding of the tactics and strategies that underly the ""beautiful"" game. The main thrust of the book is the idea of space and how to create use and deny it. There are excellent illustrations and diagrams showing exactly how this is accomplished. This is superb book packed with insight and great value. The best soccer coaching book I've read 5+ stars."
3,Bio-Gas Technology and development of Rural Women,It can be more simplified. It is not only for office going or managerial lavel people. he must seplified so that a commom man can understand this
2,Expected More,Reads like a chapter in a middle school history book with pictures. Expected some personal accounts however only got writers view.
4,Impressive book,"This book is very interesting and impressive, especially for those with some experience. It is not as easy to read as I expected though. I have bought others which are easier to follow."
5,Very Intertaining.,I started watching season three halfway through on TV. I was thrilled to get to catch up on the whole season. It was worth it!
5,wonderful series,"I really enjoyed this series, it has humor and drama. The actors are very talented also. I recommend this series."
4,UK BH fan,Good show that translates well to American audiences and the North American redux is just as appealing with a few twists. Still you can't deny the power and appeal of the original.
4,Sludge Hounds Knocking,"Biscuits & Slavery CD. Led heavy from this US band that rocks like a battleship in a thunderstorm. Some classic southern elements, with a stoner attitude and slide guitars all over the place. Rednecks ? Hell yeah ! ROSE TATTOO meets LYNYRD SKYNYRD meets BLACK SABBATH."
1,"6,000 spanish words","total garbage, usless the way the program is set up you have to click each word then click for it to be pronounced."
3,Palm tree manhunt,I thought this was a wonderful book because it had A lot of action in a island and where the gang meets this crazy old fellow or what Bill Collins might say mentally ill. This book teaches Christianity and tells s wonderful story about 6 gang members
2,wasted potential,"I'm usually wary of remix albums, but i bought this one on impulse because the original score is great and i thought some great songs could be made from such rich source material. man, was i mistaken. this is yet another predictable, cliched dance/techno record that does nothing but put a cheesy beat behind a sample. while it has its good moments (Oakenfold's 'Aeternal' and Hive's 'Hand Jive'), i can't believe i spent money on this."
5,Awesome Remix,"As said in another review, I am a little skeptical of remixes. I bought it just because I loved the movie and original album. To the contrary of the other review, I thought this CD was awesome! Great tactics in bringing in movie sound clips, the *drug use* snips and using awesome beats. I give it a 5!"
3,"Good, not Great.......",Chapter 5 has this Latina with HUGE boobs. The rest of the DVD is for those guys who like flat chests......
4,I thought it was a great book.,"I like the book mainly because of all the stories. Just like a good speaker a good writer has to be able to keep the audiences attention and in a book like this you definitley need some good stories. I also thought the quote at the start of each chapter was good. It's a good way to get the readers attention and have them thinking. As far as the rest of the book goes i have to say that i was quite impressed, with books like this who in some parts have to be informative its hard to keep the reader intersted but he did a great job of keeping me interested. This may be partly due to the fact that i want to be a good manager when i graduate college so i definitly want all the good advice i can get. All and all i thought this book was very good."
4,What I would least likely do,"This was a good book,the stories that were used in the book taught me alot about the difference between managers and leaders and who succeeds when put to the test.I would definitely recommend this book to any indiviual who plans on going into the management field because it gets you on the right path to success."
4,Daring to Be Different,"Good book. Broke down the fundamentals of leadership in a manner which was very easy to understand. I especially liked the little stories in boxes throughout the text. These were simple little stories which have great value since they teach us about leadership from different points of views. Most of the people in the stories were not perceived leaders at all, rather children and those in normal types of professions. Overall, I'd recommend the book as a good read. I was assigned to read it, but I do feel that it was a good overall read."
2,About what i expected,The book was just about what i thought it would be. It wasn't really that different than other books i've read about the same topic. Don't get me wrong the book is definitely worth reading. It just wasn't different from most books that i've read.
5,Robbie Hare - Review,I thought it was a very good book with several interesting stories that were very beneficial. I recommend this book to anyone who plans to be in a leadership situation
4,Daring to Be Different,"This book is not the traditional managerial book. This book teaches you how to become a ""Leader"". The main focus is knowing yourself and knowing the people that work with and around you. The book encourages nontradtional thinking and teaching. I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking to be a better manager or leader."
3,Daring to be Different,"Daring to be Different was a very insightful book because the author, James A. Harthery, wrote about his personal experiences and how his leadership skills have grown by learning from each and every situation. One instance was the 12-point bulk that we wrote about in class and it was implying that the bulk wasn't just lucky because he hadn't been shot yet, it takes more then just luck because a bulk doesn't get that big by mistake. You were able to understand this book more and be able to apply it to yourself because he used his real life situation to publish this book. If you are wanting to get some insight about someone else's leadership experience I would suggest this book then."
4,So far so good,"I haven't read a lot of this book I am reading chapters 7 through 14 right now for a class I am in, but so far I love it. It is a greeat book and it is healpful when trying to relate to leadership situations. I encourage people to read it if you get the chance."
3,Daring to Be Different,"This book would be a good read for someone entering into a management role. It is easy to read and the short stories are helpful and interesting. Even though the flow of the book seems disconnected and choppy the shortness of the chapters and the way the stories are separated from the actual text of the book make it really easy to stay with and not get bored from reading pages and pages of text. Also, the author does a good job of using his personal experience to show how being a leader is very different from and much more difficult than being just a manager."
4,Leadership management,I really enjoyed this book. It makes you realize and apprciate the small things in life. It explains different short stories and gives examples of different leadership syltes. It also gives clues of how not to be a leader. The story that sticks out the most is the first one we read You Dont Get To Be A Twelve Point Buck By Luck. It explains how to become succesfull in the business area it is not always luck it is hard work and leadership.
4,Wonderful scent,"I also have the matching talc/powder which is equally as pleasing but honestly this lotion seems to offer a more robust, long lasting scent. Sure, It's a little pricey but for guy looking for a unique sandalwood smell - This is (likely) for you. There's simply nothing else like this aroma. I've been looking for a sandalwood scented lotion for everyday usage and thus far, this is the most pleasurable and the distinct smell is definitely for me and other men.Great product"
5,great product,"found this a excellent product , it got rid of the winter dry skin feeling without a oily film it also has very faint masculine fragrance that last along time and i received many compliments on"
2,sandalwood lotion,I really didn't care for the fragrance of this product. No offense meant to the seller what so ever. I returned it and they were very kind and give me a refund for the product. Thanks again for understanding. :) We're not always going to agree on how well everything smells. :) That's just the reality of it.
5,"Early PDQ, but as consistently hysterical as ""1712 Overture""","This might be one of PDQ's very first albums. It pokes fun at small-town music stations with its silly contests, hokey news broadcasts & even on-air flubs (like the constant broadcasting problems that beset the ""2 Unfriendly Groups of Orchestras"" number) Highly entertaining, this & the ""1712 Overture"" cd should definitly be a part of your cd library..."
5,Brilliant,"This is a cross between Uno and Snap. It is quick thinking and great fun.It would certainly help younger children to learn some numbers, a little addition/subtraction and some of the alphabet.For the first few games instead of the ""free for all"" snap approach we took it in turns to see if we coud play a card. This helped us to get to grips with the rules and ideas, (which are extremely easy). This would also be ideal when playing with young children.My children are older and my husband and I have yet to beat them at this game which is great fun for them!"
1,jack,very disappointed with the cd. Does not live up to the hype...sorry...but not as sorry as I am now that I am stuck with a cd and won't play it anymore...oh well
2,Poor Imitation of Tortoise,"This seems to be a well-made shave brush with moderately stiff bristles. However, the handle is a nondescript mottled color that looks nothing like tortoise shell. Since makers charge more for ""mock tortoise shell"" or ""faux tortoise shell"", there is no reason to pay a surcharge for a brush that does not have a reasonable resemblance to tortoise shell. Much better to choose a type of badger bristle that you favor (""silvertip"" is rated the best), and a well-known manufacturer such as GSB or Jagger."
5,A soul-lifting experience,"Two tracks on this album, Aurora and Canyon Song, are among my all-time favorites by anyone. Beautifully paced and building up to emotional waves that wash over you, this is true 'soul' music, a precurser to the best emotional highs the Pat Metheny Group can conjure up. The texures are exquisite, the musicianship suberb and the soloing always moves the piece forward."
2,Not what I had hoped,"For the price, this book is very thin. It is not a training manual or even a guide. It seems to be written by an older pilot looking back over his career. I was looking for a book with more guidance. If you order this book you will be very surprised at how little it contains. It is more of a personal journey memoir. I have read and would strongly reccommend reading books by Barry Schiff - they seem to have more practical information and direction. I bought this book for my son and will be returning it."
2,Nice Read - Not As Described,"I have read the other two reviews and only agree with the first reviewer. I have been flying for 28 years as both a recreational pilot and a professional commercial airline pilot. I expected this book to be a guide and full of practical advise for my son who is in the middle of his career as a pilot. It is not. It is seriously over priced and over hyped. I agree there are much better books out there for advice and instruction. Do yourself a favor and try to get this from the library if you want to read it, do not spend the money."
5,Took me by surprise,"I've kept away from American tea brands ever since discovering Twinings many years ago. There was no comparison. Twinings English Breakfast was my usual daily fare ... until I gave Tetley British Blend a go, as the Brits might say. Now I can't get enough of the stuff. This blend at this strength is an absolute winner. You might even call it a tiny little tea-leaf revelation. Keep it coming, Tetley! You've more than won me."
5,Great condition,Received this book new to replace a lost one from the library. Price was great and saved a lot rather than paying replacement value to library. Thank you.
3,A Literary Booster Shot,"Quick and painless. This is a reasonably twisty departure from Muller's Sharon McCone series, easy to take, atmospheric and ""real."" Muller has never been the kind of writer to shy away from the dark places of people's souls and hearts and this book is no exception. I do feel, however, that her dialogue has become less sharp through the years, much more cliche-ridden. Don't expect ""Cyanide Wells"" to stick with you, even with its surprise ending. It's good, solid disposable crime fiction. You may feel like putting it down, but by that time you'll be finished."
1,"Love Sharon McCone, Hated This Book","This book was really weak. The concept of the plot sounded good at the start --- lost woman reappears after 14 years, why did she run, what ghosts haunted her -- but the book never goes anywhere. Even more frustrating, all sorts of things never are resolved, including insights into Gwen and why she ran, what was her problem or what were her ghosts, what was the motivation for the call to Lindstrom (this was partially explained, although it was always left as a dangling assumption). The principal characters were likable enough, but that alone couldn't carry the plot. Very very disappointing."
1,Maybe I read a different book,"because I thought this book was weak and not up to Marcia Mullers normal standard of writing. The character development was extremely poor, we never really know what motivated the killer. The italics printing of the characters thoughts was weak and would have been unnecessary if the character development was better. It was an interesting basis for a plot it just never developed. If you must read it, wait until paperback."
3,Do you like your Ravel measured or asleep?,"Koussevitzky's interpretation of Ravel drags compared to that of Claudio Abbado. Abbado conducted a BSO performance of the same works on Deutsche Grammophon many years ago, and I wish I could find THAT on CD--after all, Daphnis et Chloe is a ballet, not a dirge."
1,Odd,"I went to the library to check this one out after reading one of her articles on the internet attacking white people. The book itself is well written, but it seems to have the same racist undertones as her online work. The focus of the material centers around comparing white people to other ethnic groups in negative light all the way through the book, basically. I would avoid the book as a white person unless you are suffering White Guilt and need a quick stab at lowering your self esteem."
3,gives good insight,The book contains a collection of various females from differened colored backgrounds and their distinct views on feminism. the book gave me insight on the lives of different colored women and the way they decided to stand up against the stereotyping. However I was dissapointed in this book because most of the stories were by colored lesbian women. it was hard for me to related to this book fully because much of it contained the homosexual issues and I could not relate to it fully being a straight woman.
1,Where is the balance?,"I guess the book should really have been called ""Whites not Allowed""? Where is the book ""White Women on Today's Feminism""?"
4,Edgy Third Wave Book,"Colonize This will make some readers uncomfortable to the contributors' honesty and in some cases anger. The various entries bring race to the center stage and this in itself will cause some readers to shift uncomfortably as they re-think their own particular privilege.This book is ideal in a women's studies classroom or ethnic studies, english, or sociology. I think the book would be best served by also reading _This Bridge Called My Back_, since so many of the contributors refer to _Bridge_ as causing their ""click"" of feminism.Colonize This isn't your typical academic tome, but a personal (and political) book that should cause some lively debate."
5,"Sweet, simple, and elegant.","I recently received this label set. I bought it, having loved the lettres stationery set by the same designer. I wasn't disappointed. The designs are very varied (I don't think any sheet is repeated in the exact same colors) and there's a plethora of different sizes and colors so whatever you need a label for, you'll find an adequate one in this set. The colors are soft and muted, the designs very simple and elegant with classic borders and traditional typography. There would be nothing out of the ordinary to point out about this set except that it's really very pretty and, being that it's such good quality, it'll add a touch of class to your mail and everyday projects. Personally, I liked it very much and am getting good use out of it."
5,Charming Labels,I bought these labels at a store several years ago and used them up so I was delighted to find they were available at Amazon. The round labels are perfect for the lids on my homemade jam. They stick really well to the lids but they don't stick all that well to many other surfaces. They come in all sorts of shapes for a variety of uses.
3,flashy,very attractive watch but like other reviews I found that the buttons are easily pressed while wearing often making the date and time inaccurate.
2,cheap watch looks better in picture,I did not pay much for this watch . It looks it. The band is like tin. I am giving it away at the school's auction.
1,Wretched,"I wanted to like this book; I wanted to go with the author down the libertarian/encroaching government theme. But the book is awful.The characters are less than 1 dimensional. So few motivations for the characters' actions are presented that it became a farce by the end. You could have fun only by creating reasons out of thin air for the characters actions. Kind of like Mad Libs as you read -- except you paid for this.The plot is alternatingly high-speed and dead stop.Neither of the 2 ""breakthru technologies"" are explained even a little bit. The reader is just told ""hey, we invented this"".And the ending is so rushed, so contrived, and yet so open-ended it punishes you for having made it to the end.Awful stuff."
1,I'm sorry I lasted to the end,"The wacko 'Leftists extremists', are stridently going to proclaim their independence from the wacko 'Government extremists'. This time science has given them a 'weapon' that may allow them to succeed, the impenetrable shield of Science Fiction. The 'Government' can't put down the rebels, if the army can't reach them...This one is not a keeper. The 'Good' guys are in a fog, or just wacko. The 'Bad' guys have no idea. (The main 'Bad' character stands up in court, confesses that he did all of the things he has been framing the 'good' character for through the entire book, and commits suicide. In a spat of remorse for crying out loud.) The Hero instantly falls in love from a photo, and spends the entire span of the book in romantic fantasies about how his life could be with the woman who has spoken maybe 5 sentences to him. This book basically just took up time... Maybe Williamson wrote it when he was a teenager, and just put it out again."
3,Song of Solomon by Ben Tankard,"This cd was okay. I bought it basically for the title song...Song of Solomon. I'm not that into jazz anymore, but it would really be enjoyable to someone who is."
2,A bit of a disappointment,There is almost no performer or group from whom I like everything they produce. This one has more than half that just isn't up to what I really enjoy. This is only one person's opinion and I am sure that this may be most appealing to others.
1,THIS CD NOT WORKING!!!!,"Hi Guys,I heard this music at a friend's house and I loved the music so much I decided to buy a CD for myself and my wife. I got it today, opened the wrapping and popped it into my computer to save on Windows Media Player and later on iTunes...... THE CD DID NOT PLAY AT ALL. EVERY TRACK WAS MARKED AS AN ERROR. I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT!!! I AM SORELY DISAPPOINTED AND I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE MUSIC.I need you all to send a replacement CD ASAP. Your records show that I made payment, however I am dissatified with the product that was sent to me.Would really appreciate if you can rectify this.Thanks, A"
2,Expressionless,"I was very dissapointed with Schnabel's playing of the first sonata, opus 2 number 1. His fingers can clearly fly, but the expression was limited, particularly in the stunning opening theme which passed by too quickly. He is admired for his 'accuracy' and 'innovation' but i just don't think he sounds interesting. Soloman Cutner's Beethoven is much much better."
2,Wonderful CD - Dreadful recording!,"What a disappointment - I have waited so long for this title to be released on CD - I treasure my vinyl copy so much. Whilst the CD doesn't have the scratches and pops of the vinyl, it is very poorly recorded when one considers how it could have been done. Why one asks. One track is omitted from the listing (no big deal, but sloppy) but the sound quality is just not what we have come to expect from CDs. I have this artist's other CDs and they are great - why this one?! It's the best album she recorded in my opinion! One track even jumps during the song! I wouldn't be without the CD but I can only hope that CBS or someone will produce a better recording of it in the future."
2,Disappointing reissue,"Just got the new reissue of ""Sometimes Late At Night"", an album that would be one of my Desert Island Discs (definitely a ""5 star release""). However, this CD is very cheaply presented: only the cover photo remains from the original package (with an ugly pink border). The original back cover photo is not incuded, nor are the song lyrics. For that matter, there are no songwriter credits, and one song ""On The Way To The Sky"", does not appear in the track listing (though it is on the CD). Finally, the remastering is pretty horrible with jarring distortion (between 3:10 - 3:12) in track #12 (""You Don't Know Me""). I suppose we will have to wait until a Japanese label licenses this from Boardwalk Music, RKO Records, and Reach Entertainment, Inc (distributed by City Hall Records) and reissues it right! Oh well, I guess it's better than nothing...but not by much!"
3,Not Essential Listening,"I remember being captivated by this album when it was released in 1981. Burt and Carole created the ultimate in sophisticated adult pop music with this grand song-cycle on the meditations of love found, lost, and reexamined. Yet upon hearing this album over 20 years later, it doesn't hold the same appeal. Save for the heartbreaking ""You and Me,"" and the devastatingly honest ""Somebody's Been Lyin'"" many of songs, although luxuriously produced and arranged, seem fleeting and kind of half baked. I would compare this album to cotton candy: its oh so sweet, but you can get sick of it real quick. I would no longer classify this album as essential listening,"
1,Big miss,"I am a fan of this typ of music, and a fan of carole as a writer, but I must say that I was not impressed at all by her vocals on this album. She was very stiff and very weak sounding. Plus, the overall production of the songs was lacking something as well. Kind of sloppily pasted together. My advice... stick to writing, and not to singing!!"
2,Disappointing Production Values,"Carole Sager can sing, but the production values on this cd were a big disappointment. I kept thinking, why is she singing elevator music. The background vocal and instrumental are mushy, even on good stereo equipment. The song selection is interesting but as an addition to your collection I recommend checking it out of the library for a one time listen."
4,Solid Buy...but,"This was a very good buy, but as others have written, attaching the small screws to the base is difficult unless you use something stickey to hold the philip head screws to your driver while holding the lamp up for final attachment. A magnatized screw driver might work here as well.More importantly, be careful not to dispose of the packing material until you have accounted for all the small parts especially the small, clear plastic washers and thumb screws that attach and insulate the glass shade elements,(there are 4 for each socket),to the light segments. Most of the many small fastners had worked loose and got caught-up in the packing material during shipment. Look carefully!Once assembled and installed, the light looks quite nice. I also bought three 50 watt flood lights, (the ad says ""45 watt max"", but the fixture is marked ""50 Watt Max""), that seem really too bright; 35 watt would have been better."
3,Pretty but broken when recieved.,I opened the box when I was getting ready to install the night it arrived. One of the arms on the tracking bar was broken on both of the fixtures I ordered. It looked like whoever packed the items shoved it into the box and broke them. They would of looked beautiful in both of my bathrooms.
5,CROW'S FEET ARE FOR THE BIRDS !,"Wonder why it is that the first facial lines to appear are often around the eyes. All that smiling, perhaps? Whatever the case, no one wants those tiny lines accenting their eyes and we know that crow's feet are really for the birds!Cellex-C, an acknowledged leader in the field of anti-aging products, has developed Eye Contour Cream Plus, a light peach-colored cream that will reduce those telltale lines. With 5% L-ascorbic acid it puts to work the one form of Vitamin C that the body recognizes and uses for collagen production.For use apply to the eye area after cleansing and toning. Follow with moisturizer if desired. There may be a slight tingling sensation after the cream is applied, which is a sign that the L-ascorbic acid is being absorbed into the skin.Recommended for all but ultra sensitive skin types, this cream causes no untoward reactions such as a sensitivity to sunlight.Our clothes are wrinkle free - why not us?"
5,Absolutely stunning,"Class Trip is an absolutely stunning book - a very tightly written book with more suspense than The Name of the Bullfighter which is itself a great book. An excellent psychological portrayal of middle school age view of the world, of classmates and of ""Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew"" children's mysteries."
2,It felt like a class trip,"I thought that ""Class Trip"" was an ""okay"" and mildly suspenseful tale woven by Carrere. The author solely relies on images of graphic violence and fluid language to convey something that can be found in any slasher flick. He is no Edgar Allan Poe nor Stephen King."
2,No libretto!,"I was roundly disappointed that this CD contains neither the German words nor the English translation. I remember (vaguely) the words from my old record which *did* have the libretto, and I speak a smattering of German, but I still could only catch maybe half of what's going on.Guess I'll be visiting Wikipedia!That's a big black mark for you, Vanguard."
1,Unintelligible and repetitive,"If you liked Schickele's Oedipus Tex, then you've heard pretty much all the ideas used in the Blugrass Cantata before. This recording, however, has an impenetrable libretto sung in German, with no translation in the cover notes. It's also sung mostly by Peter Schickele, whose voice is dull, flat, and less than melodic.The No-No Nonette is also less than inspired.All in all, a great disappointment. Buy Oedipus Tex, it's hilarious and very clever. Leave this one on the shelf."
5,what music,i'm a big decibels fan and this cd shows how much they have grown since their last release. i highly recommend this cd for anyone who enjoys the sounds of 50's rock/pop.
3,Picture Books are for Kids,"I was disapointed with this book because it revealed no tricks on how to seduce the ladies. For the price you'd think there would be at least one chapter on how to get on the good side of the fairer sex...if you get my drift. The first clue that this book wasn't going to be very good was all the pictures. As everyone knows, picture books are for kids--not guys trying to win over the ladies! My friend had a really great book on how to soften up the maidens but: a) I forget what the title was; B) He moved away so I can't ask HIM what the title was; C) I owe him fifty dollars anyway so I'd rather let sleeping dogs lay... if you catch my drift. I remember there was a trick you could do with paper-clips that was gauranteed to work on the ladies but I forget how it was done. Three stars because some of the pictures were VERY seductive."
5,Carnies,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews. I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...Carny (1980) stars Gary Busey and Jodie Foster. Set in a carnival setting, this movie captures carny life very well. The atmosphere is great, as are the shots of the rides, the sideshow, really everything. The acting is great, especially by Jodie Foster and Gary Busey. Busey is great as the dunk tank clown. His laugh is great. He would make a great Joker, in my opinion. Maybe not so much in the face, but definitely with the laugh. The plot is twisted, the carnival customers are out of control, and the movie is never boring. Jodie Foster's performance is one reason why she's considered one of the top actresses of today.I highly recommend this classic."
3,Carny,"I used to love this movie when I watched it on VHS. Now it is avaialbe on DVD and it looked good till the ending. It seems the studio decided to cut out the part about the townsfolk getting their just deserts for trying to take advantage of the Carny people. It made a much better ending. The movie is still good but it used to be great. A note to the peopel who released that, leave the original; alone that's the way it should be. Some times they add extra footage, this tiem they took footage away."
5,excellent classic,"this feature has alot of classic elements , a child actress turned adult jodie foster , a rocker turned actor robbie robertson and the very funny and pecular gary busey , takes you to the circus ."
3,Carny,"Hi there, I must say that this VCR was ok, it was not as good as thought it would be, loved Jodie Foster, and the actors with her, but the story was so far fetched was theonly dead point, the buyer I got the film from was very RUDE, and I would not like another film from him. thanking you, Gordon."
3,Looks good but ultimately I found it disappointing,"I thought this would be just the thing to get me band-ready. It seems like a great idea and it is simply and attractively formatted. The choice of songs is excellent. However, whenever I tried to use it, I was usually disappointed, for example:- Born Under a Bad Sign -- tab only for solos (which would be better improvised anyway), chords shown but fingering suggestions would be helpful.- Stormy monday -- scary chords & changes (fingering suggestions might have helped a lot here)It may well be that I am not yet ready for this. The chords & chord sequences seem rather unusual & tricky for me, although conversley the solos seem pretty basic. Also, I am not yet in a band. For a new blues band this might provide some valuable insights & assistance. It seems a little overpriced at $19.95 with CD, for say $12.95 this would be a snap."
2,"Great medal, poor quality",I loved this medal. St. Francis on one side and St. Anthony on the other. I purchased it for my three year old lab. One month later the medal snapped off the ring. My dog is not overly active. I think the material was too soft. I paid almost $12 including postage. I found the exact medal at my local Catholic supply store for 75 cents.
5,Great summer hat for kiddos-- SPF 50!,"This is really the best summer hat for kiddos! SPF 50 protection built into the fabric, plus generously sized to cover baby's delicate skin all around. The fabric is also super-light, making the hat perfect for travel and easy to dry after a day by the pool or in the sprinklers.Purchased two of these-- in orange and white-- and both are well-made, true to size, and fantastic. Very happy!"
2,Wrong product description and way too big,"Not sure why the other reviews didn't mention this, but the description says you can purchase this in size 6-12 mos, but when I received it the label states 6-24 months. That range is so large, as is the hat! My 8 month old is swimming in it. It is cute looking, especially the green color I ordered, but I don't think the drawstring works to make it smaller either."
3,"Cute, but no workie on my lil'guy",We bought this for a trip to the beach for our 8 month old. This hat stayed on for all of 12 seconds. Not the hat's fault. I think only duct tape or staples could keep anything on his head at this age. We opted for an umbrella to protect him from the rays.
5,just what i hoped for,i ordered this hat for my granddaughter i havent had a chance to use it yet because of new york wheather but i did put it on her the tie straps help to keep it in place and the adjustment helped it to fit correctly the color was nice and the material was smooth the brim was also large enough that it protects her neck and face i was pleased with the hat now i hope we get a chance to use it
3,Giant Hat,"I looked and looked for a hat for my newborn girl. Since this said 0-6wks I assumed it would work, but it's huge on her stil, now 8 weeks. I guess I'll keep it for next spring. It's a very expensive baby hat for not fitting."
3,"Nice hat, but...","I like the style of this hat, the brim is very wide and gives good coverage. I wish there was a velcro strap instead of the ties though. My baby pulls on the strings and either tightens it way too tight or unties it compleletly, very annoying."
5,cute,"It is extraordinary to my baby for going out, the color is ok, i want to buy more colors. and it is big enough for my baby who is 4 month old."
2,Better suited for a girl.,"Cap portion doesn't fit securely on his head. Large brim, small cap. Would have to be tied to stay on."
2,Seems like a nice product,"I bought 2 of these hats for a cruise we are going on but, have to return them. I ordered the 2-4yr size but they sent me two 6-18mth sized hats. Hopefully I can get them exchanged for the right sizes quickly. But the product overall seems nice."
5,Great Hat,"Was looking for a good sun hat for my baby that could also be worn at the pool or beach, and this hat is just what I was looking for. I love how it can be cinched to fit a smaller head."
4,Cute!,"Lovely color, like the sun protection, good price and quality...just am not sure about the sizing. It might help to put circumference measurements for babies' head sizes since the little buggers vary so widely!"
5,looks great!,I love the way the hat can be adjusted to my baby's head. The colour is exactly as shown in the picture. It protects from the sun.
5,Pleased with purchase,"I wanted this for when wearing my baby in the carrier. He has a bucket hat that makes it impossible to explore with his eyes. With this, I can fold up the brim when he's alert and fold it back down when he falls asleep. You can cinch up the top part for a snug fit. The 0-6 barely fits my 2 mo old at the snuggest fit. I washed it before wearing, according to the instructions, and I didn't have any issues. And, last, it's easily packed with no damage to the brim -- I can fold it and slip it in my back jeans pocket."
5,Another positve review....,"Baxter, known for his various short stories, brings all his literary talents to this novel, Shadow Play. I'll let the other readers' comments cover the basic plot and storyline, which is superb, but I do want to pass this bit of information.I came away from this novel feeling as if I had just found a modern-day Catcher in the Rye with an adult Holden Caulfield. The writing is so vivid and accurate that I found myself empathizing with many of the characters' thoughts and situations. What ""Catcher"" was to me at 16, Shadow Play is to me at 29. A very adult examination of an ordinary life in an ordinary town, written in a very unordinary fashion.A beautiful book for anyone who enjoys a well written yarn."
5,An ordinary life?,"This novel has enough guts, great writing and plot to fill three books. Relationships with family members, becoming an adult and tough decisions that come with it, love, insanity, suicide and redemption are all addressed. The amazing thing about this novel is it looks at all of these things, and never looses focus. The story circles around Wyatt, his looser brother, his wife who can do magic tricks and his insane mother. Also, He has an aunt who is writing he own bible. Baxter does a great job of interaction between characters, particularly in the dialogue. Mr. Baxter is more known for his short stories, but after getting reading this I can't help but hope he turns out more novels before he is done. This is that book you have to put is someone else's hand when you finish it, because you sometimes forget how much 300 pages can offer you."
4,Nice enough. Kind of steep price.,"They work well, but don't hold them by the handle when scooping brown sugar... it will bend. I would have liked them better if they had been constructed of a heavier gauge steel."
3,they don't sit right,I like the stainless steel and that's why I bought them... but the handles are heavy enough to make them not sit right when you put them on the table they tip until the handle rests on the table. They are fine other than that.
5,Very Neat Measuring Cups,"I have used my plastic measuring cups exclusively for about 25 years. Love them, but they are becoming porous and harder to clean. Purchased these new stainless steel measuring cups. Very easy to use and clean. Probably will love them for 25 years, too. Great purchase and great service from provider."
5,"My Favorite Song, My Favorite Grouop","I went to Berkeley in the 1960's and I had forgotten how much I like Country Joe and the Fish, until I heard them on youtube. Had to get this album and it met and sustained my good memories. There isn't a better song than ""Who Am I?"" and with the change of a few words the ""Fish Rag"" would be, unfortunately, relevant today. Got the album in a group of three and when I listen to them, I can close my eyes and walk down Telegraph Avenue (in Berkeley)."
2,Now I remember,"I bought this album when it came out, gave it a listen or two, then gave it away. Having listened to the CD a couple of times now, I remember why.....there are two listenable songs, and one maybe. Sorry CJ&F but you peaked with Electric Music For The Mind And Body, a true classic."
2,Not very good,"Not a memorable video, watched it once, not all the way through..don't know where it is, maybe out on the last yard sale."
1,"Not as described, Didn't work with my Canon T3i","I bought the item for my Canon Rebel T3i DSLR camera. Seller's item description states that the flash is compatible with Canon DSLR cameras. But it didn't work. I mounted the flash as described in the manual and tried many different settings in my camera. But I couldn't get it to work. When I try to enter my camera's external flash settings while the flash is correctly mounted and switched on, I get a warning states that ""either the flash is powered off or incompatible with the camera""."
1,Not for Canon PowerShot S5,"I bought this flash hoping to save $200 over the price of a Canon Speedlite 430ex. I attached it to my Canon PowerShot S5, and found that the camera was able to detect the external flash. I went to a dark room to experiment with the flash and found that it simply would not fire. I changed all the settings in the camera to no avail, the flash would simply not fire without pressing the ""Test."" After packing it back up and returning it, I went to go buy a Speedlite. Sure it costs a whole lot more, but the Speedlite is a much better flash than the Sunpak (perhaps because it actually works?).The packaging said that it works with Canon DSLR's, but some research shows that people simply can't get this flash to work with their cameras. Don't buy!"
5,I'm 2 for 2 with these,"Have used these twice so far, one on a 52"" Wilson CB antenna and the other a 48"" Comet ham radio antenna, both have done the trick nicely. Having the antennas mounted on the roof, I went with the heavy duty springs as I offroad a lot. These work great."
3,Antenna flex spring shock.,Shipped and received promtly. I would have wanted to know the spring shock was too stiff. Destroys antennas not designed to flex. But... better than no flex at all.
4,Almost exactly what I wanted,"I have a 4 foot fiberglass antenna and it still sways a lot at highway speed. This spring is a LOT better than the medium duty spring I had, and would probably be quite sufficient for a stainless whip. If you have a fiberglass antenna though, go for something just a touch beefier."
1,Terrible Product,Spring flexes much too easily causing a loss of ground.I do not recommend this product to anyone with anything but a small antenna.
5,Easy install,Works as described so far. It took a whole 2-3 mins to unpackage and install on my Firestik II antenna and Firestik coax stud (and supporting Rugged ridge) bracket for my Jeep.
3,Deception,"This spring was listed as ""a suggested item in combo with the antenna I bought."" When it came, it did not fit. The screw was 3/8"" for the antenna's 1/4"" fitting. As with some products, it costs more to return than to keep it....sooooo I am very unhappy. I have lots of CB items that are just fine."
4,Definitely a heavy duty spring.,"It's actually a bit too heavy duty for me. I have it attached to a bracket I built and then a four foot fiberglass antenna on top of that and I can barely get the thing to flex. The medium duty spring would have been better for my application, but this is nice. No word though on longevity, but looks and feels quality."
4,spring shocks they to,They to came early and was in good shape and un opened they fit into the mounts on my tool box and work great
4,Looks good so far,Using it on 10/20/40m hamstiks. Shipped quickly and looks well made. Has just enough give but not so much as to let the antenna bend to far horizontal at 60-70mph
4,not bad,it does its job and keeps the antenna from snapping but it doesnt screw into the bedside stake hole mount all the way on my truck i think i have to shave a few threads off
3,This does the job,A good product that does what it is advertised to do.Nothing fancy... just a well made product that performs as you expect.
1,No support,"This machine worked very well for three days. Then it sucked up something hard, which got stuck in the mechanism. Now it does not run at all. Attempts to register the product online and obtain support were unsuccessful, and phone support is available only while I am at work. One way or another, the machine will be replaced by another manufacturer's product."
2,I am concerned.,"This product was the tops with us. We absolutely loved it and it saved us so much time. However, after only owning it 6 months, my 12 year old son used it and the plug started on fire. We were using a normal outdoor extension cord,He could of got electricuted.I am concerned this might happen to someone else too.And... I am not sure what to do with the machine we have."
1,Leaf Hog is Dangerous,"Last Wednesday, July 13, 2005, I was using the $85 Black & Decker BV4000 Leaf Hog Blower/Vacuum to blow the leaves off my driveway. I'd been using it less than five minutes, when it suddenly started burning, and melted itself at its electrical connector. It also melted the end of my $50 100-foot extension cord. $135 dollars down the drain, and I'm lucky I wasn't injured. I will contact the Black & Decker and ask for a replacement. If they want to see the melted Leaf Hog, I'll send it to them. I'll let you know what happens."
2,Black & decker leafHog BV4000 type 2,"Black & Decker Leaf Hog 12 Amp Electric Blower/Vacuum #BV4000I used this product strictly for leaf bowing for two full years and loved it. I decided to use the vacuum feature this season. It started out great....but....after just two bags of mulched leaves, it just died...I was very dissapointed... It's just not very duarble! :("
1,Complete POS,"I finally threw this thing in the trash this morning after it sprayed me with leaf debris and dust for the umpteenth time. The catch bag comes loose on a regular basis, spraying the operator with dirt. It's heavy and awkward to use, with the provided shoulder strap not helping to distribute the weight much at all. The vacuum nozzle is large in diameter and makes it difficult to suck up leaves from between rocks. I hated it."
1,BV4000 work around,"I searched this site looking for any workarounds for my BV4000 mulching needs. Finding none, I've work out my own. Maybe these will work for others.1. Trim the back of the ""clip"" so that there is nothing to put your thumb on. I used some pruning shears to clip all of the plastic that I could. Then take about a 2"" binder clip [sometimes known as a C clamp] and clamp it onto the clip holding the bag to the frame. This should allow you to mulch to about 1/2 a bag when combined with number 2 below.2. Cut off the orange plastic covering on the back edge of the bag. This allows a lot more air to exit the bag. Yes, it is a little dirtier, but it takes a lot of pressure off both the clip and the zipper. This keeps both from coming apart.While there is no perfect fix, these may help you get through another ""leaf"" year."
1,DANGER!!! DANGER!! STAY AWAY!!,Bought this brand new from Lowes. After 10 minutes of use right out of the box it started emitting an electrical burning smell and also lost a lot of power. You can see sparks flying. This is extremely dangerous. It's a great way to burn your house down or cause you to get electrocuted. I would give zero stars and recommend that you stay away.
2,plastic Impeller too cheap,"I agree with what people are saying about the impeller. It needs to be built more rugged. Mine was also pitted and chunks of it are missing on the edges of the impeller. I have used mine only a few times. It definitely cannot handle pine cones, even though the manual says it can. I would recommend using leaves only with it. The leaves did fine. It really should be made out of metal, not plastic.Also the on/off 2 speed switch works sometimes."
2,Good but not maintainable,"The Leaf Hog did a credible job, all parts worked, but now the motor needs new brushes and they don't sell them. Nothing else wrong with it; lacking a simple $2 part and it is now unusable. I will go with another brand."
1,Very Disappointed,"Overheated with first use, even using a heavy duty cord. The sad thing is, it's not worth bothering to send it back(to the manufacturer)."
4,My opinion of Amazon's response to a problem,"I have written you people twice regarding the condition in which this item was received by me. To date, nothing has been done to correct the problem nor have I had any correspondence from you regarding the problem. Needless to say I am very unhappy with you at this time due to your lack of concern over my problem.Tom Sexton"
2,Electrical switch,"The blower works fine, with more control on the low setting, but the clip holding the vacuum bag on is very fragile. I found that if this unit is used around wet or even damp leaves, the motor will shut off until it becomes dry again. As of yet, i havn't been able to purchase a replacement vaccum bag."
2,Motor burnt up...lasted 2 years,This blower worked fine until the motor burnt up. I used the blower lightly for about 2 years. Never used the vacuum. The design is clunky. Made in China.
2,motor burns out,"We have had 2 of these (from Lowe's), used primarily for vacuuming. Works pretty well on leaves and grass, but will not pick up acorns. Major complaint is that the motor burned out in about a year each time. I'm planning to buy a Toro 51599 instead."
3,"OK Blower Performance , not so good as vac","I purchase this blower for the season. The blower works very well, enough power and easy to work with. The vacuum works fine when the leaves are dry, if the leaves are a little wet then it gets stuck very often."
1,Electrical hazard,"My wife purchased this blower so she could clean up behind me after I mowed and trimmed the yard. We only used this for about one hour of regular household chores when it started to burn at the plug in receptacle. I was using the recommended extension cord for 75 feet - 14/3 - and it just melted both the cord end and the housing. I disassembled the housing to see the extent of the damage, but as soon as one of the plug prongs fell off - it had been burned through - I tossed it where I have thrown all of my other Black & Decker tools for the past few years - in the garbage. Black & Decker may have had a good name 30 years ago and their industrial stuff may still be good, but their consumer products have seriuosly declined over the last years and I doubt that I will purchase another B & D item. I know that I probably won't be able to buy a similar tool made in the U.S. - this blower is a wonderful example of NAFTA - but I will keep trying!!"
