1,Does not work at all.,"This product does not work at all. Ive used it for 3 months. They say it eventually stops the hair growth where you use it, and itll make the hair grow back slower and slower. Ive always plucked my eyebrows and they DID NOT grow back any slower with the use of this Verseo Epen.Dont waste your money on the Epen, go to the salon and get a tweezed/waxed."
1,didn't work,"I had it and used it for over a year with no results. I even tried professional laser with no results. So maybe I am a difficult case, however, wanting this to work and wasting so much time felt bad. Also, you have to pluck the hair out after treating it (if I remember right). I threw it away a couple years ago. Darn it."
1,Ineffective,"This product did not work for me, though it works for others. Following the instructions in the manual did not remove the hairs permanently."
1,Terrible,"This was a terrible product. At first you feel like it's doing something. But in reality, it's doing nothing but giving you headaches. Instead of getting rid of hairs, it makes more grow. I had to give up and go to a professional electrolysis. I suggest never to use this product. NO GOOD!"
1,"VERSEO IS A SCAM AND WILL LIE AND TELL YOU YOUR CARD WAS DENIED WHEN IT WASN""T!!! DON""T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS!","HORRIBLE COMPANY! VERSEO IS A SCAM AND WILL LIE AND TELL YOU YOUR CARD WAS DENIED WHEN IT WASN""T!!! DON""T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS!"
5,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!!","This item is WONDERFUL!!! Painless!!! It does work!!! I've spent $$$ trying to remove my unwanted facial hair and it always, always grew back. I've always had to tweeze morning and night but with this item I go long periods without having to tweeze, it grows back slower, thinner, and is finally disappearing. I couldn't be more satisfied. Definitely worth the money. I am truly amazed and very thankful. Please see Target's website for more positive reviews."
3,Verso Pen Hair... Help!,"I think I like it... I am not 100% sure yet. because I haven't used it enough... I have P.C.O.S and I have a lot of hair to get rid of hehe! I have not quite figured out if I should use the face pad or the body pad on my neck area, I have used the probe on it and it had an intense tingle. Not enough for me not to use it, but enough for me to question whether to use face pad for 5 mins or body pad for longer. Also I can not pluck I need to shave certain area's so what should I do?? Any advice would be very helpful.. Thank you!"
1,Didn't work at all,"The light on the charger never lit up when I plug it in, and my Razr never recognized it as a charger."
2,"""Unauthorized,"" but still functional","This is the charger that came with my RZR V3C. Before today, there were zero problems. Strangely, today, my phone says ""Unauthorized Charger"" when I plug it in, but it seems to still be charging nevertheless. If there are any changes, I'll be sure to update this post."
1,Not really,"This is not a Motorola product.""unauthorized charger!"" message when plugged into my V3C.Doesn't seem to charge."
4,It'll Do Until the Analog Age Ends,"The Panasonic PV-V4525S VCR was very reasonably priced, was purchased to replace an old unit, and hopefully it will last until the analog age ends a few years hence. After using it a few weeks, it seems like it will fulfill that function well. It is quiet when recording and very fast when rewinding or FFing. The picture and sound quality is excellent. A minor complaint is the difficulty in controlling the tape while rewinding or FFing when one wants to stop/play tape at a specific point. Almost invariably, I under-or-overshoot because the unit allows some tape to continue rolling after receiving the command, as it gently brakes the tape speed rather than stopping it on a dime. Thus I REW/FF several times, trying to stop it right on the point I want, but rarely do I hit it exactly. This could be a bigger problem if I were someone who wants to do a lot of taping, but overall, I like this unit."
5,my review,This is a nice VCR with a clock. It's easy to use and inexpensive to buy. The free shipping was great to have. It's hard to find VCRs in stores so this was a convenient way to shop.
2,WENT DEAD AFTER A MONTH,"Worked fine for a month, then went completely dead. Took over a month to fix, fortunately within the 3-MONTH labor warranty period. Had it been after that, the labor charge would have been more than I paid for the VCR! Like the technician said, you get what you pay for . . ."
5,Good product,"I bought this product around a month ago, started using it 2 weeks ago, I had no problems so far, it was easy to setup and use for the first time.I have been recording daily from TV and the quality is excellent."
3,VCR,"BASED ON THE SPECIFICATIONS LISTED ON LINE, I THOUGHT THE VCR AUTOMATICALLY FRONT FOWARDED PAST COMMERICALS LIKE THE PANASONIC VCR DID THAT I WAS REPLACING.WITH THE NEW ONE YOU HAVE TO FOWARD FOR 1, 2 OR THREE MINUTES ETC.ALSO REWINDING AND FOWARDING IS VERY LOUD."
2,Crappy VCR Panasonic 4525S,I have owned a lot of VCR's and never had a problem with any of them and I supposedly got a new one. I have another Panasonic 4522 and it has been a dream. I wanted one of those but I couldn't find a new one. I think the fast forward and reverse is ridiculous. You can never stop the darn thing where you want it to stop and it is very frustrating to have to mess with it when it is supposed to be so easy and has always been. I wanted to like this vcr but I can't say anything good about it and I overpaid for this one. ($200.00)
4,Panasonic VCR,"I am a a great fan of all products Panasonic and this VCR does not disappoint. Installation is a breeze. Playback resolution is great for a vcr format and there is surprising clarity in recording mode. Fast forward and reverse are a little slow but not dealbreakers. Overall, I am very pleased with this VCR."
1,Great disappointment,"I bought this product because I felt that Panasonic was a reliable option. I had to return it as, despite using Panasonic support helpline I could not get either picture or recognisable sound! Tried it with 2 TV's with same result."
2,Needs to move into Century 21!,While this unit may have been cuttign edge 10 years ago it offers just basic connections....not even an S video connection! Give its limitations it performs well. As far as useful life goes....only time will tell. It is not the type of product I have come to expect from Panasonic in the 21st century!
4,Panasonic PV-V4525S VCR,I'm very happy with this VCR. It's hard to find one with a clock on the front since so many people can't set them. This one is easy to use and I've had no problems with it.
2,"Bad brakes as other reviews say,","and for some reason, it has to be off to record and there isn't any setting to change that."
2,Better books by better authors,"If you want a technically stronger book, pick anything by Balena or Richter. Dan Fox had a pretty bright future in the field of writing technical books and evangelizing Visual Basic, but he squandered that potential by hiring on with a company like Quilogy. Steer your attention and your dollars toward authors who write objectively and do not fill their books with oblique references to their third-rate consulting firms."
1,Second rate author with third rate company,"Give it up for a failing, tired, third rate company that is not going anywhere. Dan is not the best but he deserves better. The book is not too bad but I have seen better especially some of the newer books. He's getting better. At least Box is not writing from Q."
3,Better than expected..,"I expected this to be just another low-budget adventure flick, but it was actually better than expected. The fight scenes and acting weren't spectacular, but the story was interestingly told and somewhat makes up for this.I did not like 2 major things with this film, which is why it only gets three stars:--Some of the character backstories aren't told, which makes it annoying when they introduce a character and you don't learn anything.--There wasn't an ending. I realize that this was supposed to serve as a pilot for a tv series, but it doesn't resolve anything or answer any of the questions raised by the plot.Overall, if you're looking for something different to watch, give this one a try."
5,Best Basic Highlighter,"I'm in college. I'm broke. These highlighters are perfect. They last a while, come in a variety of colors, and are perfect for textbooks, notes, etc. I've tried some other fancier highlighters and when it comes down to it you get the same quality as these for a more expensive price.I've been using these since I was in elementary school and I will continue to do so!"
2,Stale markers,"I thought I would get a deal getting cheaper highlighters from amazon, but they dried out really fast. Significantly faster than any other highlighter pack I've ever purchased at a store."
2,Average Smooth Jazz,"'Collection of cool, urban, dinner/cocktail music.. raise a chilly cosmopolitan'. This is average smooth jazz that can be found on los angeles ktwv the wave radio station. It is not as 'cool' as it puts out, slow and a little funky. Sinatra-esque it ain't. If you strictly like smooth jazz, this is your cup of tea."
2,Meh,"Basically, this set sucks. I bought it to cut fimo clay canes with, and one one hand, the blades are nice and sharp. They pass through the canes really easily. On the other hand, the handle does not hold the blade in securely. The blade shifts when any real pressure is applied, which makes it hard to do neat slices, and makes the knives useless to me. And yes, I've tried tightening the handle, to no avail. So save your money, and buy a real exacto set. Not this cheap knock-off."
2,"Work well, but deceptive design","They only last for about 2 months. The big black print on the highlighter is designed specifically to hide an empty chamber. Its like a bag of potato chips, the packaging can fit three times the amount of liquid in there."
3,extremely wasteful,"these highlighters run out quite fast -- i can highlight a textbook and three days later the ink is almost all gone.it is great to make profits making and selling these highlighters, but it is not good for consumers.also, after the ink runs out, there is a lot of plastic that get thrown away as trash.the old style of Sanford highlighters can highlight textbook well, but the new Sharpie / Chisel type cannot. so I am forced to use these and pay a lot of money for them. the old style one can last three months without any problem, but it must be too slow for profit making selling them."
2,Not much ink,They are good highlighters but they only last like one or two chapters of highlighting. For almost a dollar a piece I'd like the highlighters to work for more than 40 pages.
3,It's ok,"These highlighters are on the more high end side I guess. I'd prefer to use the normal sharpie highlighters (I've always used those) but I saw these on sale for 75 cents and thought, ""Why not?"" My only issues with is that there's too much ink used sometimes - they take longer to dry than normal highlighters and some colors are too dark to use (like the blue)."
3,Worth It For $0.75 & Free Prime Shipping,"For the price I spent on the highlighter, I don't feel too horrible about purchasing. But it would definitely not be worth retail price.Pros:- Depending on what you prefer, might consider this a con. The cap capped on very tightly. Need to use a bit of strength to open and close the cap. I liked this because it prevents leakage. And you know for sure that you capped your highlighter.- Didn't smudge.- The chisel tip wasn't too large that it covered two lines of text when I only needed to highlight one line.Cons:- Runs out very quickly. I used one highlighter pen for two weeks of light-moderate highlighting, and it's gone already.- The color that you see in the photograph of the highlighting liquid is all you get. The previous poster was accurate in the description. You literally get only an inch of highlighting liquid. The ink does not extend into the black label. (Reason for the highlighter running out so quickly)"
2,Looks are deceiving...,"You see the space between the gray spring-like thing and the black logo? That's all the liquid you get. When I first bought these, I thought I'd be getting an entire tube of liquid.Highlighters ran out after two weeks. So not worth the price. Maybe if they made use of all that black-covered space.You can get the same five colors from a certain other maker for less than 2 dollars and they work great. Liquid was neat, but I'm back to the foam.Two stars because they were decent enough to highlight with."
3,"Nice Feel, well under 49mm","Was looking for a tamper for an Elektra Micro Casa (49mm basket). Tamper is a little under 46mm in Dia. (Backet is listed 1.929"" - measured 1.960"", Tamper measured 1.802"") So there was a lot of room around the sides. The feel was very good, the finish was very good. Functionally it's a two star, craftsmanship I'd give it 4 stars so I split it, although be warned about the size."
3,"OK, but a little small","I found this tamper to have a good feel in my hand and helped me apply better pressure for making espresso than the cheap plastic tamper that came with the machine. My problem is that it is significantly smaller than the basket I put the espresso grounds into. Rather than just tamping with pressure and a twist, I have to tampe all over the basket. Rather than saving me much time, it take a little longer. I don't have any other tamper's so I have no idea if this is a standard size or not. In the future, I'll probably go to a brick/mortar store and make sure it is the correct size."
1,CD Projects Steel Case is bad,"This case does not travel well. In fact it stinks! It has one set of hinges on the back and none on the sides or front, so when it takes an impact it bends off center. The sleeves are hard plastic and disintegrated. Maybe it was too cold inside my suitcase in the belly of an airplane, but it did not even survive one trip. I am a frequent flyer and this is JOTS. (Junk on the street)."
2,"Works, just not very well","This thing works fairly well at speeds of 30 mph or less, but if I drive faster than that the people on the other end really start to complain about not being able to hear me. I've moved the microphone in all different places without much luck. It is currently about 15 inches from my mouth attached to the overhead center console (away from the windshield). But it just doesn't filter out the background noise very well. On the other hand, some people claim theirs works just fine so it could just vary based on your car (mine is a pretty quiet car, though) or it could just be that I got a somewhat faulty unit. My wife's car has a handsfree unit built-in to her Acura and it works quite a bit better than the Parrot one I have."
3,Be sure to check the phone compatibility list,"Before you buy this device, go to Parrot's website and make sure your phone is compatible. It will not work with my Droid X at all and customer support only tells me that it's not compatible and they can't help."
2,Bad for Honda Element,"I had this unit professionally installed with the standard $50 wiring harness made for Honda vehicles. My car is a 2004 Honda Element with OEM stereo. The first notable thing was my radio no longer had close to the volume it had before the install. Second, when receiving an incoming call, the radio would not mute completely, resulting in me having to turn down the radio. Third, my music would be incredibly bassy, and no amount of adjustment could compensate. The installer tried to trouble-shoot the problem, install a relay to shut down the radio when calls come in, and made calls to Parrot tech support, which gave them no solution to the problem. I had it removed from my car and ended up eating the install fee. I really liked the convenience of the parrot, but for my car, it was not going to work."
4,Hand-free and hidden,This kit was a simple plug and play for my application.No power cord or clip-on visor unit to put away when parked.
2,Phone compatibility is pretty spotty; firmware upgrade very difficult,"Before you buy this, make sure your phone is compatible with this unit, by checking out [...]! From personal (frustrating) experience, this phone worked with a Blackberry Bold 9000 and a Nokia 7020, but refused to pair with a Sony Ericsson TM506 and a Samsung Gravity 2 (SGH-T469). Installation was a pain, since the wiring had a loose pin somewhere, and the device would stop powering up if the wiring moved at all. If a firmware upgrade is needed, you either need a serial cable that only dealers have, or you need to disassemble your car to get the brains out of wherever you installed it, and ship it off to Parrot - if they ever respond to your requests. I wanted a simple, but reliable unit for my mom's car - and while this unit is simple, it is far from reliable. Good idea, poor execution."
3,Fitted to 2010 Honda CRV,"Fitting was easy especially with special optional wiring harness. Controller is compact enough for compact dash area. Dislike how long the car takes to recognise the bluetooth on my phone when the car is first switched on, mostly up to 30 seconds, quite annoying. On our other cars, the factory bluetooth link occurs within 3 seconds. Not sure if I'd buy it again, however it beats the expensive Honda accessory, and there not many good options. It''s okay but was hoping for a better experience."
5,Works perfectly,"Not a whole lot to say on this one. It works absolutely as advertised. No glitches or anything. It paired up almost instantly with my iPhone 4 and continues to do so every time I start my car. I did, however, wire this up differently than how it's supposed to be. I used a Connects2 adaptor from the UK to integrate the product seamlessly into my BMW 3 series. This allows me to hide away the ugly control unit in the glove box and use the steering wheel controls to control the product.As said before, works great and I would highly reccommend!"
1,Green Day Sucks!,"First of all I would like to address the idiot who wrote that Green Day is any good. This person doesn't know anything about music and has nothing better to do than write about such an untalented band. If you want talent, look for a band like Led Zepplin for example! This single sucks. It's a re-arrangement of the Oasis' hit Wonderwall. What a copycat!!!"
2,"If you don't like to drink tea leaves, don't buy this",Customer service is horrible (see chamomile review of this product)and it doesn't strain out the leaves. I highly recommend a tea straw.
2,"No Liquorice Flavor, Very Disappointing","After enjoying some licorice peppermint tea at a local restaurant, I was eager to find some for at home. This is a fine peppermint tea, I was happy to find a herbal blend (caffeine-free), but I cannot taste any trace of licorice in it. Especially disappointing as I took a risk and bought the 6-pack. I should have taken my time and read more reviews for the other varieties!"
3,No replacement for Aveda's tea,"I ordered this tea because a couple reviews suggested it was similar to Aveda's wonderful licorice peppermint tea. It is not! The licorice flavor is almost nonexistent, and as peppermint teas go, it's only fair. I have yet to find anything that is exactly like Aveda's brew, but so far think Yogi Egyptian Licorice Mint comes closest. Try that instead of this!"
4,Catch That Cat!,"Daniel, a boy living in Montreal, has a cat named Josephine who one day causes him a great deal of trouble. Josephine stows away in his backpack and comes with him to school where she is unwelcome. When she's discovered Josephine leads the teachers a merry chase until she finds an unexpected refuge. This clever plot twist will surprise and delight the reader and illustrate a very human tendency to include beloved if unruly pets where they might not otherwise fit. Powerful acrylic illustrations capture the dramatic chase with vigorous humor. Contrasting pencil illustrations on the verso feature Josephine and allow the reader to see Josephine's view of the adventure. Reader's will delight in the slapstick chase and an ironic conclusion celebrating our affection for pets.For children from five to eight."
4,"Contractor-class fixture, but classic look","I think my grandma had fixtures like these in her house, and now we have them in ours. I needed to purchase a new one when the clip that held our original fixture into the mount broke off. It was easy to install, looks good if not fancy, and provides a good amount of light for most normal sized bedrooms."
2,Not so great.,Very pretty but not very useful. The cork separated from the ceramic top. After that I could no longer use it.
4,Rand McNally 00 Road Atlas : Deluxe Edition,"I found this atlas to be extremely helpful. The maps and index are easy to follow. The maps are up to date, including new roads and highways that have been renamed"
3,Too big!,"This atlas is just too big and unwieldy. I can't figure out where to put it in my little Mazda. Right now, it's taking up a whole passenger space in the back seat."
5,Read this book!,I can not believe this is his first book! It was a very good read. I like how Mr. Almanzar showed what happens to those who interfere with Gods work.
5,easy to install,"The item was easy to install on my 2002 Expedition. I did it more to hide the rust that was forming there, but it was easy to put on and works."
1,Some Should Not Read.,"Disjointed, flighty, confusing. Good premise, but: Where are we? Who are we? What is going on? Where are we going? Very claustrophobic. Limited to high rise buildings in NYC and a vehicle on the Western plains of the US in different time periods. No definitive characters. Those that were defined, who cares? I'm still trying to figure out the plot. And I don't agree with the author about the chapter from a collection of short stories that he ""tacked on"" in this later version. This was all done so much better in ""Earth Abides"". You probably shouldn't waste your time, much less your money."
2,Some Should Not Read,"If you love novels about the end of the world as we know it (TEOTWAWKI) then you may be able to wring enjoyment from this dry crust of story. What should you expect? Main characters who kill everyone they meet or see in order to either eat them or steal from them. Main characters who slaughter whole families, including women and children who refuse to bow to their will, their demands, their ""organization."" These, keep in mind, are the heroes of the story. If you enjoy this military adventure, then read on, but expect no pay off at the end. There is none. The ending is so disjointed that many readers are convinced there are separate stories in the book. In fact, these are the ""end"" of the novel, such as it is. If it's a great TEOTWAWKI story you want, read Earth Abides or Alas, Babylon or The Furies. This story honestly makes me question the sanity of those who published it. If ever a novel deserved a descent into obscurity, this is one."
3,where are the last 5 chapters?,"Lasting impressions? This book was over too soon! After a lengthy intro into a fascinating world of urban survival reflected in the high plains hunker-down mode that it bred after years of conflict, the book just ends abruptly. The theme of a single man representing a civilizations ideals is very well placed and explored, as is the backlash from said single man's actions to bring these ideals back to the people of post bio-plague America. Unfortunately the last 100 pages or so of the book seems to be missing. Riding off into the sunset saying 'all's well that end's' is just not enough for me."
2,"Interesting concepts, wonky delivery","There were some really tantalizing concepts to this book, but you have to overlook the mechanical faults of the story. Algis should keep on writing, SWND was a worthy effort."
5,A trip down memory lane!,"The Spiral Starecase, a largely underrated band of the late sixties. Tight musicianship and superb vocals make this one of my favorites. ""More Today Than Yesterday"" is a true classic, but there are many more great songs on this album, if you dig deeper. Give it a listen, you won't be dissapointed if you love the late sixties horn bands!"
2,Not impressed,"I was really hoping this would be a good introductory video to learning about money. I think it is way too advanced for younger kids (ie, 6 and younger). I bought it based on the other reviews and the applicable ages 3-9. Since I bought it for younger kids, I am disappointed. It did not hold their attention and parts of the video were way over their heads."
2,Don't bother.....,This game looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute. The commentary by Norman Chad and Lon is repetitive and the graphics are poor. You are better off playing on-line for practice. Slow and boring.
4,GOOD SEQUEL!!,okay this game is a good sequel..actually very very good...but where is Mike Matusow? Doyle Brunson? Sam Farha? Dan Harrington? Phil Ivey? Greg Raymer? Annie Duke? etc. Where are the elite poker pros? where are they at? they shouldve at least added LOTS of top named poker elite or at least a hollywood poker player like Jennifer Love Hewitt..haha...well..cant ask for more..anyways get this game..its pretty good..
1,Never Used The Game,"I wrote an E-mail to describe my problem as follow..........each time I loaded the game and attempted to ""run"" the game, I received an error saying that ""d3dx9_30.dll"" could not be found. I the received a second(identical) CD(within one week of the first) with the same result. I asked for advice and have yet to receive any response. I've have the merchanise for over 30 days. The E-mail was sent after I received the second CD. I thought it was a Part 2.I have no confidence in the contact system/customer service. Not making any more orders too soon."
2,unusually disappointing,"Yes I agree with the other reviews that the artists on this release are all GREAT & that Nat West ""live At Austin"" has generally been of the most high standard.Which is why this dvd surprises me. Only 47 minutes with at least 30 minutes of sensational material missing !!!eg. Willie singing ""sitting in limbo"", Kris ""here comes that rainbow again"" & his song about Sam Peckinpah, BillyJoe ""live forever"" etc etcThey've also omitted a lot of amusing banter.This could have been one of the BEST in the series but it's turned out far less than it should have been"
3,TOBY,"GREAT SONGS WISH IT WERE A BIT LONGER.ESPECIALLY LIKED THE FIRST 3 I SHOLULD HAVE BEEN A COBBOY, LITTLE LESS TALK AND WE SHOULD BE KISSIN,JAS"
1,lousy pump,this pump stopped working within two months of purchase. the dispenser top is held in place by a friction fitting that loosened immediately and the pump part constantly sticks in the down position.
1,Terrible Design,"This dispenser has three things wrong with it: first and worst, the body of the dispenser is made in two parts and the bottom part, with even a small bump, falls off and all the soap spills out. This has happened endlessly with both of the dispensers we bought. Second, the soap shoots out horizontally, not down as one would expect. So until you get used to placing your hand in front of, rather than under, the spout, you get soap all over your clothes. This is especially disconcerting when you have guests, who invariably exit the bathroom with a wet streak down their pants. Finally, the cap sticks in the down position. We would never buy this product again."
1,Pretty but fragile,"Love the look, but it stopped working within a Month of daily use ... not worth the price"
5,Awesome!,Great product. It was easy to use and has been working like a charm since i got it. Much easier on the hands than traditional dumbells. Love em!
5,Far superior to the competition,"This review is for the 2009, 5.0 model.Going by the reviews, it almost seemed like the SelectTechs were a better set of weights. But if you are on the fence, do yourself a HUGE favor and try them (and these) out in a local store first. I could not find a pair of Selects that worked as flawless and simple as the PowerBlocks. Judging by online images only, I thought the Selects were more traditional looking and that the dial would be simple - it may have just been abused floor models that I tried out on the Selects, but I could not get the dials to turn smoothly, but in the first few seconds of trying out the Blocks I could tell there was a significant difference in quality between the two. Its very impressive how the engineers got this system to work so well, and the size is not a problem at all. I'm very impressed with these and looking forward to 'bringing it' with them into the future:)"
3,1970 B movie horror film..,"A NASA scientist is ordered to take a vacation due to showing signs of stress while working on his latest missile project. Traveling to Japan, he decides to indulge in his botany hobby and begins experimenting on a Venus flytrap plant he brought along with him on the trip. Using radical techniques and falling into madness, the scientist eventually creates a plant creature that feeds on flesh and blood, which then sets off to find food in the form of people in a nearby community."
1,What ??,"Hey, we had an Asia Collection from the first period once.That was great! The Wetton-era Asia published 3 studio albums and here is a 2 disc collection of their 3 albums. That's silliness. Buy those 3 albums instead of this!"
2,A True Guilty Pleasure,"God knows why I like some of this crap. It's fairly awful arena-rock splooge, the kind that makes Boston look subtle. Four musicians from some of the greatest rock bands of the 70s trying to cash in on the 80s pop/rock circus. Trust me people, Wetton, Downes, Palmer, and Howe are far, far better players than this swill indicates, and they've played on far better material. Still, if you have a Spinal Tap-like love for silly-ass overblown rock, there's some fun poop on this collection. Hey, you get all their first three albums! Woo hoo! Only for masochists like me and 12-year olds (or people who never got past age 12) who actually take this crap seriously."
4,Asia: one of the true rock bands of the 80's,"Admist the pop and new wave revolution, Asia emerged from great bands, Yes and ELP. Asia incorparates the feeling of such bands while giving a flavor of the time. Giving their music a much more upbeat pop feel. If you like Boston, Foreigner, or Journey, I would definately take a look at Asia.As far as this 2CD set is concerned. Some of the tracks are not nearly cleaned up as much as the could of been. If you aren't a big fan of Asia I'd recommend this CD; however, if you are a fan and own most of Asia's Albums don't bother, nothing special here worth the extra money."
1,"Don't get this set - get the ""Gold"" 2-disc anthology instead!",This set has poor sound quality. There is a major drop out in the middle of Track 9 on Disc 1. I can't believe how that could be overlooked. The 2-DiscGoldcollection is the exact number of songs in the exact order and the remastering is superb.
1,What a disappointment,"I love watching someone get crossed up, but this video isn't really about that. I thought I was going to get a highlight reel of ankle breaking moves: what I got was a boring video. At least half of the video is a biography of the player they are going to highlight, w/ much if it just being praise from other players. No real meat. And hell, I know about these guys, if I wanted bios on them, that's what I would have bought.The other half is about people getting beaten off the dribble, but rare are the footage of actual slick moves, and guys left stumbling or confused. Watching a player weave through defenders, is not breaking ankles. I wanted more shoots of moves like when Dwyane Wade crossed up Eric Snow so bad he fell down. I saw that game, and they included that highlight. Most of the rest was rather boring."
1,Request by amazon,My Gastro Doctor recommended that I take Calcium Caltrateevery day as part of a healthy colon program.I chose this product because of it's title which included the words colon health. Caltrate Colon heath.My wife purchased a Caltrate product which was not advertised as Colon Heath for me locally before I informed her that I had ordered on line.The active ingredients were identical and were purchease at a lower price.
4,If you heard We Are What We Are in the 80's and ...,"...you wish to re-live your youth then this may be for you.The production value is high; in the music, and in the male and female vocals.The lyrics are ""light"" but most songs have variation within them and have good chorus. Some songs may have charted in the 80's; Holiday, We Are What We Are (not an antheim), He's A Man and All The Love.Perhaps 1 or 2 of the 10 should have been left off the album, ie. All Day, All Night but the remainder are a good pick up for anyone interested in 80's music or may have heard and liked them when they were young."
3,A gem of the 80's,"This was one of my fave 80's bands(at least in 1986-87) - with classics 'Holiday' and 'We are what we are' - most of the songs on this, their debut album are tight, stylish, some fun & zany...others more serious - I must say they certainly have a unique style. They had a video for 'We are what we are' If I recall...and I suppose they may have done one for 'Holiday' which is a true classic. This german synth-pop band has style, individuality, form. I havent heard their second album available only as an import I believe. I dont know if they did anything after the first 2 albums.paul"
2,YOGURT MIX,PRODUCED TOO STRONG A YOGURT. A FEW TABLESPOONS FROM A FRESH GREEK YOGURT WAS MUCH BETTER.
2,"Good, but the price has gone WAY up!","A couple years ago I bought 4 double packets of this starter at $2.99 per double packet and it worked great. Just came back to try and order some more, and it has MORE THAN DOUBLED in price. How can this be? What does it contain that is so impacted by the bad economy? Using this new price, homemade yogurt is the same price as store bought. Granted, it's a higher quality product, but a price increase of 133% is ridiculous."
4,good starter,"This really works. I just added half bag for 1 Quart milk, and the yogurt came out really good. But just like other start, it's not as powerful as using the leftover yogurt."
4,Great Starter,Easily usable unless you want to only make 1 quart instead of 2quarts (my yogurt maker is for 1 quart). Then the measuring was impossible. And the directions are in grams and litres which makes it difficult to convert. But I would buy again for the ease of having a packaged product on hand when I am ready to make yogurt.
2,Not necessary,It is easier to use a tablespoon of plain yogurt as your starter rather than this product.
2,Yogurt Starter,The first time I used this product the yogurt came out soupy. I switched to another brand and it was perfect. I will not use this again.
2,Doesn't work with Easiyo,"I've tried this starter 3 or 4 times with the Easiyo yogurt maker, and just couldn't get it right--it came out watery and just not tasting very good. Full disclosure: I don't know how it will work with other makers. Based on some price comparisons I did, this is pretty reasonable if you buy 4-for-3 here at Amazon. But only if it works with your maker, of course. . ."
2,It might make good yogurt but...,"The company did a real bad job delivering what should have been a small simple package. The address was wrong so it was delivered to the wrong apartment in my complex. The delivery took such a rediculously long time that Amazon was sending me emails telling me they would not charge my card until shipment was confirmed. I had ordered a Donvier yogurt maker at the SAME TIME as the starter but had enough time to try out the yogurt maker three times, decide it was a crummy product and ship it back to Amazon BEFORE the culture even arrived at my door. Two stars for lame service."
3,Not real happy,Didn't have very good luck with the batches of yogurt I made. Gave up after 3 attempts. Want to buy top quality yogurt equipment at a good price?
3,Just Olay at best,Very expensive and doesn't make yogurt that tastes as good as using some store bought yogurt as the starter. I won't buy it again.
3,ok,The yogurt was pretty sour tasting. I don't know if I like it or not. This is the first yogurt starter I've ever used.
3,Pretty tart and rather liquidy yogurts,Pretty tart and rather liquidy yogurts. Add some dehydrated milk to your milk to make the yogurt thicker.
1,Stale Cultures,"I have been making yogurt for years and have never had a problem with yogurt cultures. Attracted by the connivence of home delivery, I ordered and used this starter. Although still ""fresh"" per the expiration date, the starter failed to create yogurt and appeared to be dead and have inactive cultures. To be sure I had not killed the cultures by measuring the heat inaccurately, I tried a second package. Sadly I had the same result. So, I went to a health food store and bought my usual yogurt starter (Yogourmet, freeze dried yogurt cultures), and had no problem.I cannot recommend this yogurt starter."
3,The taste is not great for me,The taste of the yogurt is not great for me - but it is my private opinion. The shipment was as described.
3,Cuisipro Donvier Yogurt Starter,"When I bought my yogurt maker, I thought it would be wise to order starter, too. I'm not sure it was a wise decision. The yogurt, although nice and thick, was way too tart for me, even just letting it incubate for 4.5 hours. I'm having better results using plain yogurt from the store."
3,yogurt,There is no need to purchase this product. Just save a few spoon cups of yogurt and mix it with warm milk and let it cool down. I make about a gallon of yogurt every week without using any of these products.
2,Same program with different title?,"Hopefully closer to the release date of this title more information will be posted here. Until then, can anyone confirm whether this is the same program that was previously released (and still available in on Amazon) as:The Day That Panicked America: The H.G. Wells War of the Worlds Scandal (2005)The Day That Panicked America: The H.G. Wells War of the Worlds ScandalThat title ran 74 min. and was hosted by John Ross. It was a 2-disc, the second being an audio CD of the original radio broadcast. These two items sound so similar, and I have the 2005 issue. Perhaps other WOTW fans out there need confirmation as well."
3,Super Nice But Started To leak,This was a lot of fun. The kids loved it. The slide was really key. They had a ball jumping on the bouncer and sliding down the slide. It was easy to get on because of the platform.It took us a little while to figure out how to put it together because the directions are not so great.The big problem we had with this is that it started to leak from one of the seams. We sent it back to Amazon.They took it back with no problem and paid return shipping. They had no more in stock so we couldn't get a replacement.We had this for about three weeks. I would buy this again if they get it on Amazon again.
3,"Great quality, not too impressed about design",I love this faucet. It got really beautiful shape. really well made. I bought this in chrome. It's a bit too shiny for my taste. I wish I got it in nickel finish. The hot and cold buttons could have been nicer. they look too plastic(cheap) to me. And the font that they use on the buttons don't look good to me. They are a bit too big. That's the only part that feel like they just slap it on.
4,Essential reading for anyone interested in disability.,"Biklen's compilation brings together a collection of double-blind experimental evidence on the reality of facilitated communication that can only be ignored by those people (mainly psychologists) who feel that any positive findings they find unwelcome are automatically suspect. useful for people who want to explore the possibility of taking a new view of the significance of communication handicap in intellectual disability and autism. (I've read the book, by the way: the last (anonymous) reviewer seems to have condemned it unread on the basis of its authorship on the give-a-dog-a-bad-name-and-hang him principle)."
4,Early years of nuke policy,"Wheeler has written a fine synopsis of the early years of nuclear policy. At only 74 pages without endnotes, you should have no trouble reading it in an afternoon. The book is a well-documented (for a 74 page book) historical account of events from 1945 - 1948 that led to the nuclear policy that emerged in the 1950s. He details the amazing challenges facing Truman, from the decision to drop the bomb, then to the effort to create an international body to control the bomb, and finally to the reality the bomb would have a future in American warfighting and diplomacy, and what that role would be. Throuout this time, Truman was faced with the additional stress of defining America's new role as a global leader. Colonel Wheeler was the Chief of Nuclear Negotiations on the Joint Staff at the time of the book's publishing."
5,Warm-hearted and funny,"This story is about the visit of Uncle Zeka, who normally lives deep in the Zimbabwean bush, to his straight-laced relatives in town, including his niece Tapiwa. He causes chaos-as a result of doing things like constructing a trap for wild pigs in the garden and driving a car when he doesn't know how--but his warmth and spontaneity enchant Tapiwa, who quickly becomes embroiled in his adventures . The story is very funny and sparkles with inventive touches. Never a dull moment!"
2,Do You Know Me?,"I recently had the opportunity to read the paperback version of Do You Know Me? After completing the story, I have very mixed feelings! I really enjoyed the character, Uncle Zeka. He was in my opinion, the strongest character in the book. His unintentional and well meaning antics kept the book interesting. I also liked the character Tapiwa and felt a great deal of empathy for her situation. These were in my opinion the strong points of the book. My disappointment comes within the remainder of the plot. I felt that there was an overuse of characters which made the book quite hard to follow and as a result I lost interest very quickly. I would have been unable to complete the book had it not been for Uncle Zeka and Tapiwa."
5,Incredibly sharp and balanced knives.,"These are perfect kitchen knives IMO.A pleasure to use. Incredibly sharp and smooth and the weight feels balanced.Feels comfortable to hold.Excellent visual design, incredibly elegant as a single piece of forged steel."
5,"Philippines guide, 2","We were being assigned to the Philippines and I browsed through all the travel books available on the country. I chose this (the first edition) because i liked the way it was written and that the writers live in the Philippines. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed! In fact i found both the information provided and the personalized descriptions of places to stay and eat very helpful. When the second edition came out i bought it and passed on my old copy to a friend. The 2nd edition has new information (unlike others that i have found are almost completely re-writes of past editions) and continues to be a more personal travel guide. I will be sorry to leave the country and this book has helped my family enjoy our travels."
5,My Opinion,"Fr. Knight does an excellent job of explaining this subject. I have not made it all the way through yet. However, what I have read so far has given me a better insight of what I need to be doing before and after confession."
1,Doesn't Fit,"Amazon confirmed that it fit a 1999 Ford Ranger prior to purchasing, it does not. Nothing more frustrating than getting something you've been waiting on and then having to send it back."
4,Committment,"I guess it works if used as advertised, but you really have to do it to see any real results. Good theory, but cumbersome and impractical."
5,why i love this book,"Matt has this uncanny way of making you laugh right when you think you are going to cry and then make you snort-laugh instead of it. He captures daily moments and distills them into the delicate dance of smoke tendrils arising from sacred ritual or plants them in the dirt with the beets -- either way, you know this still frame from your life -- and if you don't you want to."
5,Things we know we don't know,"Matt Mason is one of the best young poets today. His book is sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and always thought provoking."
3,Classic comedy!,"Season 2 brings more of the same antics and problems seen in season 1, only this time, Gomer (Jim Nabors) and company are in a California Marine base.Frank Sutton returns as the cantankerous Sgt. Carter, and Ted Bessell (who later went on to star in That Girl with Marlo Thomas) is introduced as Gomer's friend Frank.Notable episodes include ""Opie Joins the Marines,"" where Andy Griffith and Ron Howard (of The Andy Griffith Show, of which Gomer Pyle is a spin-off) guest star. There are also a few episodes in which Jim Nabors sings, in his beautiful real voice.Gomer Pyle, U.S. M. C. is a classic sitcom, full of laughs and nostalgia that viewers are sure to enjoy even today."
3,Something lacking,I had a let down feeling with this - the presentation of discs was not as good as Season in and I expected wrongly or rightly to have commentaries continue by Mr. Nabors. With all additional costs and conversion to $aus this proved to be an expensive exercise. I do have other copies of these dvds and only purchased them to hear commentaries and to get the episode in Washington and the beautiful singing by this wonderful artist
1,MISREPRESENTATION by CBS video,I was happy to shell out 30 hard earned dollers to buy this set only to be disappointed by the editing of the original shows. Whole scenes where Jim Nabors sings are cut and much of the background music has ben changed. When you buy a set issued by the original studio you expect it to contain the original content. I'll never purchase another CBS release.
1,Betrayal,"Don't get me wrong -- Gomer is a 5-star TV show, but Paramount's infuriating censorship of these episodes cuts some of the very best moments, such as Gomer singing to the dog Killer [a.k.a. Lemley Gilbert], a scene that is still extant in prints out there, still appearing just a couple of years ago on TV Land. The senseless cuts really do take their toll and make this set less enjoyable to watch than the first season collection, which was much better than this set. SHAME on Paramount for their senseless editing of a classic show. There is NO EXCUSE for this."
4,Gomer hits his Stride!,"Enjoying this, the second season of Gomer Pyle. The first thing we noticed was that it was in color (we're quick that way). Also, Gomer is now deemed competent enough that Sgt. Carter lets him fire a bazooka. The episodes are still funny and the characters are even more likable."
2,Not what I expected,I purchased this book after reading the preview given. After readingI was very disappointed. I found it to be boring.
4,Makes you start thinking from the inside out (instead,"Very good book. It gives great insight from the point of view of a black man and did a great job in sharing short experiences of men dealing with a number of different topics (romance, friends, life), some that we, as women, do not always consider or realize. As a take away, I am now even more inclined to first consider what a man might be going through and his interpretation of a situation, instead of first assuming what I may think he is or should be going through or how he should react. The opposite sex may never really understand everything going on in the others mind, but this book was able to enlighten me in a number of areas."
4,Personal throughts,"Chocolate thoughts are collection of essays and short stores of men views on love, racism, and other things that black me go through. I throught the essay were really good an very informative about how black men think."
5,AMAZING!!!,"My naturopath prescribed this mix for a flu virus and the results were simply incredible. I felt better within 24 hours, and without the side effects of regular antibiotics--no impairment of immune system, no yeast infections, etc. Now we keep a bottle on hand for every winter season."
5,Baby Know It All,"These are the best videos for teaching your child to talk. My son receives speech therapy and his therapist was even impressed with both volumes. My son learned his ABC's at 18 months by watching the Animals and ABC Vol 2. Fantastic...better than the videos that cost a fortune for the collection you see on tv,as we bought one after this one. They do not hold his attention as well as Baby Know It All."
2,Not what I thought I was getting,"I own both ""My baby know it all: Animals and ABC's"" and ""My baby know it all:123's and colors"" and my daughters LOVE them. They really are great videos that keep a young child's attention while teaching them. In fact, I bought this DVD because our other two DVD's were getting worn out and would skip a lot. I thought that this DVD had both movies on it, because that is what the cover says. The DVD I got was NOT both vidoes. All the DVD I got had on it was the ""123's and Colors"". NO where on that DVD could I find the ""Animals and ABC's"" no matter how much I searched through the DVD. I do recommend buying this video series, just make sure you buy them as two seperate DVD's so you KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GETTING."
3,In my opinion...,"'The Truth About Ruby Valentine' is a great book, but in my opinion it's lacking something.I did like the way it's written. There's flashbacks about Ruby Valentine and how she became the celebrity she is today. The other parts are present day about Kelly Coltrane trying to find out things about the mother she's never come to know.Overall, a great book to lose yourself in."
4,Very good but not perfect with major flaw,I first bought this because of its look. The stainless finish is nice. However I was really disappoint with the batter cover design and awkward power button. The batter cover is flimsy and would pop up easily once batteries are in place. I had to return because of this flaw. This frother makes very nice and thick foam though. I may buy it again after just tried Aerolatte which doesn't make foam as good as this one.
1,TWO PLUS TWO AND I'M FINISHED,I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE FIRST ONE I BOUGHT BECAUSE IT PRODUCED SUCH A NICE FOAM AND THOUGHT IT BROKE BECAUSE ITS DESIGN MADE IT AWKWARD TO HOLD. I PURCHASED ANOTHER AND AGAIN IN A FEW MONTHS IN BROKE AGAIN. IT IS POORLY CONSTRUCTED AND UNFORTUNELY CHEAPLY MADE AND TOO HARD TO HANDLE FOR ME!
2,Disappointing,"I had great hopes for this book, as I'm always on the look out for fun places to take my dog. Anticipating a cross-country trip during Summer 2000, I ordered it to help plan that trip. Unfortunately, it did not prove very useful. Although it covers the whole US, the information is typically too sketchy to be of use. Hotel descriptions, for example, typically consist of nothing more than name, address, and phone number. At best, there is a rudimentary indication of amenities using letter codes, although many listings lack them. In some cases, the listing does not even include an address or merely includes a PO Box. Based on the listings for Southern California, the part of the country I know best, some of the information is incomplete or inaccurate. In listing California dog parks (pp. 231-32), for example, Walters omits two well-known Los Angeles parks. In sum, not recommended."
3,Basic Information,"The book had some good information and was a good overview of 4 sleep philosophies for babies and infants. The information was pretty basic, though. I had already seen most of the information online and from other sources. If you're looking for a very basic overview and assistance with choosing a specific method for your child, it is somewhat helpful. If you're looking for a more in-depth explanation, this book won't help you much."
5,Clapton's Timepieces,"Great music,can't go wrong with Clapton. It had arrived at home in fast time. If you are a Clapton fan and just want the hits this is for you. Thank you."
1,Couldn't even get started,"Big fan of the author, read his books on desires and Stoicism which led me to seek out his two books on children. Pretty much seemed like a depressing catalog of every wrong done to kids since the dark ages, and it's apparent that we're heading back to that in some degree. Any point to reading this harbinger of doom? Better that I spend the time playing Scrabble with my kids."
4,3D Puzzle,"My grandson loves anything dinasaurs, and this was a hit. Just had to be careful pulling the pieces apart."
3,Tyrannosaurus,Was more difficult than others that my grandson had but eventually got it together. Did enjoy it and would purchase them again.
3,Good but....,"This was definitely a bit too challenging for a 5 year old. My nephew is pretty good with directions but he needed a lot of help with this. It is however, a good price for an educational product. Pros - Good price, educational and challenging. Cons - Pieces were somewhat flimsy and didn't fit snug."
3,Track Listing,"here is a track listing for anyone interested:1 Contenders (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 5:192 Trouble (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 4:173 Somebody (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 4:304 If I Were You (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 3:355 Low Society (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 3:436 Red (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 4:017 Look at Me (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 5:148 Move Out (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 3:199 Free (Gregory, Marsh, Ware) 6:31"
1,Information is out of date,Guide is poorly compiled and confusing to read and much of the restaurant information is out of date. Skip it.
1,I wanted to love it...,"I really wanted to love this book from Chowhound. Unfortunately, I found, like many others, that it:1 - is very poorly organized2 - seems to be written for the express use of chowhound.com regulars (typical users won't understand the arcane structure).3 - is a fine resource for people dining alone, but not particularly helpful as a guide for those people looking for a true city dining guide. It focuses on very narrow niches, but doesn't provide guidance on the dishes that are NOT the pinnacle dishes at a restaurant.Chowhound, the website, is a great resource. Keep hitting the ""print"" button on your computer to store the tips that are relevant and interesting for you -- there is no reason to purchase a book with outdated information, poor organization, and a general disdain for anyone NOT planning their trip to San Francisco around food."
1,Dora tv,"I bought this item for my girls for christmas, and the dvd player on it just stopped today. It seemed like a great idea and the sound worked good, but there must be a flaw with the dvd. I unfortantly will not by another tv like this. My personal opinion is stick with a regular tv and dvd player."
2,Didn't Keep My Interest,"The book seemed at first like it was going to be a very interesting paranormal story. It had some promising elements in it. But, after awhile it just petered out for me. How many times can they watch ""Viola"" die? I get what Fallon was trying to do, but it just ended up sounding repetitive. By the end of the book I was pretty much just skimming."
2,"If you like trite, predictable romance, you will love it","I admit I'm not generally a romance reader but good ghost stories are rare so I was willing to try it. But after reading ""Eve pursed her lips"" for the 20th time in the first few chapters, I started laughing out loud. I figured out the outcome by the second chapter. The rest was just opportunity for the protagonist and her true love to fight and almost get together (basically every romance novel's theme).If you're looking for a scary ghost story, skip this. If you're looking for sentimental, somewhat erotic romance, this is the book for you."
3,"Solid Introduction, But Not For the More Experienced","This book, had I been a novice in the spiritual ""arts,"" would have received five stars from me. It deals with the three spiritual acts of silence, holy reading, and prayer, from the perspective of Benedictine spirituality. As such, it is a solid introduction to all those. However, if you have some experience with any of these discipines, and with Benedictine spirituality, and are looking to go deeper, you ought to consider another book. Vest does, though, offer a good bibliography at the end to guide the reader to more material. Overall a good book, but not one I will return to."
5,crazy price,I still can't belive I paid so little for such a great product. The chips are a high class poker chip the is ideal for turnoments and just having fun.
4,PLAY YOUR CHIPS RIGHT,"Pro: Excellent set, chips are weighted just right and it looks awesome in the case, I play poker about 3 times a week so they are real handy.Con: Only wish the set had come with $50 denominations instead of all the $1 denominations."
2,"Great title, not a lot to do","I found this work out DVD to be extremely minimal. I was very anticipatory about this video. I like the actress for the most part and her body type is a lot like mine so I thought it would be a great challenge. The shorter workouts are not challenging in the least. The longer one is but only with and overkill on abs which seemed misbalanced, again, the rest is just like...""Are we working out or just watching you tippy toe around and giggle and make personal/unprofessional comments when you feel like it?"" I felt she presented herself in the wrong light also for a video aimed at a Gaiam workout. The instructor was the only reason I repeated the video in case I was having an off day. Not the case. Dissapointed."
3,Tone with Tomei,"This DVD has amazing visual production, it is crisp and clear -the set is simple and uncluttered. Although I was not challenged by this video I think it is a great place for beginners to start out. It is definitely safe, uses all of the muscle groups and incorporates interval training and compound exercises. Some pluses of the video are that it is not quick moving. Tomei takes frequent breaks to roll her neck out, stretch her hamstrings, etc between exercises. I could find very little that the average person looking to workout could not do."
3,OK,"I have to say that I bought this because I thought it was a hula hoop workout. Its not. Its more of a yoga/pliates kind of routine. Lots of core work, balance work, very quiet and a steady pace. The exercises are challenging and I am sure they will be effective if done properly a few times a week. The resistance band was a great bonus. Its worth it just for that and even if you choose not to do the workout, there are a few key exercises that you could pick out and use the band to do them."
5,Best leg workout ever,"This is the best leg workout I have ever done. I could see a huge difference in just two weeks. I wish she would do another one. It is easy to follow, but intensive, especially after having a broken leg. But it works!"
1,Marisa Tomei video,"Cannot get the video to play. I get to the main page and then nothing happens. Therefore, I cannot recommend."
2,Probably good for beginners,"This was really slow and easy, probably more appropriate for an older person or someone just starting a workout program. I don't want to seem nasty by only giving it two stars because it would suit some just fine, but the product description made it sound like something different."
3,Best for beginners,"Note: this study is aimed primarily at women.As a survivor of childhood and adult sexual abuse, I had been through many years of counseling and therapy in various forms when I came across this Bible study. We went through the study in a small group of five women. The group dynamics were the most helpful element for me in this study.If you are just beginning your road to recovery, this Bible study will be helpful to you. It is very basic and somewhat lightweight. Again, I recommend a group setting which is led by a person with experience in this area, and who is further along in her recovery.However, if you have had many years of counseling and are in pretty good shape in terms of your recovery, you will find this Bible study rather elementary. I would recommend skipping this study for something more in-depth."
2,Fussy stapler,"This stapler is fun when it works and does a great job.Unfortunately nothing happens unless the paper is inserted just so.By the time I get the paper situated to fussy stapler's liking, I could have stapled twenty pages with a manual stapler.This thing is a novelty and a conversation piece. Don't get it for every day stapling."
4,Everything about the music!,"I was reading through these reveiws trying to see which songs I should listen to first ( I can't ever just dive into a cd, I need someone to tell me where to start) and I started to get really ticked off. People are complaining about bands not being ""punk"" enough and the tour having lost its credibility. Well, news flash people. Its about the MUSIC not the LABLES WE PUT ON IT!If you want to hear some music that is rock, punk, gypsy, screamo, emo...just about any type of rock, you've got it here. I bought the '05 comp. and I loved it. It even led me to some great bands and I went out and bought their cd's so that I could hear more of them.If you want to taste a little of everything, for dirt cheap, 8 bucks..51 bands..come on, even I-tunes can't beat that. This is def a CD for those who get in the pool at the shallow end and slowly walk deeper. Heck! Its for those who dive right in!Its about the MUSIC, not LABLES!BUY IT! You won't regret it"
3,dont buy but..,it has nofx and anti-flag on it which are some of the only good bands on here. damn i wish they had anti-flags press corpse instead of no future. oh well just dowload nofx and anti-flag dont buy this.
1,Don't buy this book.,"This book deserves ZERO STARS?This book is full of errors. If you email REA, they will send you a multi-page corrections sheet.Very poor job!"
3,Righera Greatest Hits,"One of the best pop groups to come out of Italy in the 1980's.I grew up with a cassette of there best of released in the late 80's i used to hear on my way to school.the 2010 best of has most of Righera's famous hits but the old tape i had included more hits and was better .this cd has only 12 tracks a few more songs could of been added since there is 80 min of room on cd. it is nice anyway to have a cd of there songs in the US. also the group sang in italian , spanish,and english there english song is not on this cd release.recommended for any fans of european italian pop music. a 3 rating is fair cause of a few songs that are missing that would of made it a 5 rating!"
5,Honey taught me how to swim,When I was 2-3 yrs old my mother would take me to swimming classes with Honey. Of course I don't remember much (it was 26 yrs ago) but I learned how to swim really fast and have always loved the water. She was an excellent teacher. I just had my first child a year ago and wanted to see if Honey still taught but unfortunately I learned that she had passed away. It is a shame. I heard she was working on a updated DVD that she never had the chance to make. I bought her VHS in hopes to learn from her so I could teach my kids. I haven't had the chance to watch it because I need to find a VHS player but wanted to review her tape anyway because she was the best of the best.
2,don't like it much,"18th century english garb, japanese influence, racial overtones, superficial zen...too many unnecessary distractions to mention. why guild the lilly, kenneth? this is one of the master's most enjoyable comedies. the language is profound by itself however, when set in elizabethan times, ""as you like it"" becomes a riot of inuendo and irony. when is some brave/ingenious visionary going to recreate the original and use an all male cast? that's where layers of humour can be mined to any depth a deft director might desire. alas, i'm still waiting..."
2,Interesting,It is a very interesting movie. The movie is good if your looking for something that uses the actual play. Great for school stuff.
4,"the best ""As You Like It "" of modern times?","Many times the demanding role of Rosalind isgiven to too old an actress and that of Orlandoto a pretty boy with little acting talent,but here the roles are taken by twowell fitting players ( even if Orlando isplayed out of character by a smaller black manwho makes a very bad sumo wrestler).Putting the scene in Japan is a modern devicethat doesn't fit well with many of the characterizations,but I liked the Zen sand gardens.The actress Bryce Dallas Howard is so beautiful of a green eyed redheadthat she could fool none dressed as a man,but she brings off the lines very well anyway.Someone a little more homely might be a better choiceor with a fuller square face?The Character actors roles of the Fool and otherparts are mostly not done as well as in other dvd productions.In some versions these roles actually carry the play."
2,As You Like It DVD,Rather stupid. The place chosen for the location does not fit the story so you are left wondering what they were thinking. Wouldn't waste my money on it.
3,Functional,Easy on the eye with nice photography and art direction. Strong performances by Blessed and Molina. The Rosalind by Bryce Howard is very pleasant if a bit giggly. Stunning work by Adrian Lester as Oliver De Boys. Would show this version over others in school as the Olivier 1936 version's audio is too difficult and the 1978 BBC production is rather plodding.
5,great movie,This dvd is a great performance. Set in Japan. it's a very interesting approach to the play.
2,Not as I like it,"Sadly, I can't agree with the glowing reviews here. This isn't a movie, it's a series of vaguely related and largely incoherent scenes--David Lynch on a bad day after seeing The Mikado. Kevin Kline shamelessly recycles his ""Bottom"" from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Brian Blessed is alternatively melancholy for no reason (as the bad duke) and pompous to no purpose (as the good duke). I've read the play many times, and only that allowed me to figure out what was going on--nobody else with whom I saw the movie could tell who was who or what was happening. Even the much-praised cinematography left me cold--this is Shakespeare, not National Geographic. If Ken B. would recognize that he is a very skilled actor and stager of Shakespeare, and stop trying to remake Shakespeare into Fellini, he might again produce the powerfully minimalist work (e.g. Henry V and Much Ado) that made him famous. Until such time, don't buy, rent."
1,Unhappy Daughter,"I purchased the entire season of Friday Night Lights for my daughter for Christmas. However, disc 2 of season 3 is not here. It is replaced season 4 Disc 2. Which means I have 2 copies of sesaon 4 disc 2. I need my disc 2 season 3!!! I need it immediately."
1,if you have photophobia watch out,"Greetings fellow amazonians! I picked this up because I had heard so many great things about this show. When mongo and I got off work we couldn't wait to watch it so I fired up the dvd player and went in to take a shower, but mongo couldn't wait. He started the show before I returned and that was where we went wrong. When I turned off the shower all I could hear was mongo sobbing and glass breaking. I quickly dressed myself and ran out to see what was going on. He is photophobic, so much so, that even the word throws him into a talespin which he can't get out of. He threw my sofa out of the window, broke my table and both the tv and dvd player. He even rode over each of the disks with his rascal grinding them into my carpet. When it was. All said and done I am out two windows, a tv, a sofa, table and my friday night lights dvds. If mongo wasn't autistic I would leave him in this town when the carnival moves on next week."
5,ONE OF THE BEST TELEVISION SERIES OF ALL TIME,"This is a must have for any fan. My only concern is that I thought I'd lost an episode or two when, at the biginning of season 3, so many things changed with no story lead in. Tami Taylor is all of a sudden the principal, Smash Williams has been injured, Tyra Collette has a different hair style and color, etc., etc., etc., with no explanations. Other than that, a brilliantly cast, acted, directed and written series."
5,Best Sports TV series,Friday Night Lights is easily the best sports television show I've ever seen. From start to finish you will not be disappointed.
5,Photographic & narrative reminisences of road & studio life,"This is an incredible book! Milt Hinton was born in Mississippi, raised in depression-era Chicago, and embarked on a career as bassist with Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, and then as one of the first black musicians to cross the color line in the New York recording studios. The whole time, Mr. Hinton was documenting his travels in exquisite black and white photographs, which appear throughout the book. Hinton's memory is as sharp as his photographic skills, and the story telling is just marvelous. You won't be disappointed if you buy this one!"
5,Inspiring on so many levels,"As the mother of a young son with Down syndrome, I was excited to watch this documentary. Lior is such an amazing young man...so devout in his religion and such an inspiration to the people around him. Lior shows beautifully the depth of his understanding of God and people. He is a typical boy in so many ways...with a bit of a stubborn streak just like my son...yet he is also extraordinary in his religious fervor. It was great to see how the people around him were affected and how some of their fears and preconceptions were changed. You don't have to be Jewish (I, myself, am Christian) or have a child with Down syndrome to appreciate this movie. I highly recommend it."
4,Great topic,"This is a lovely Indian commercial film. Great songs, nice story, nice script and good actors. The film addresses a rather controversial topic by portraying a very young girl who gets pregnant, and when her boyfriend does not wish to take responsibility for his actions, she firmly decides to give birth to her baby and fight all the social prejudice, including the initial opposition of her own parents. The film is interesting and engaging."
2,Don't waste your time,"I am so disappointed in this book. I thought there might actually be a challenge here. The malicious are a joke. I could do these while drunk and half asleep. If you are new to kakuro, go for it but if you have been doing this for awhile, this book is a HUGE waste of time."
2,"Good for beginners, boring for experienced Kakuro lovers","The fact that so many of the puzzles were so small and easy was a disappointment to me, but I can imagine this is a good book for beginners. There are four levels (from delicious to vicious) and only at the vicious puzzles I had to think a little bit (the delicious ones are a joke for the experienced solver - and there were so many easy ones!). I've had other books and done other puzzles where I totally got stuck, picked it up again the next day, and it took me a while to solve. Not this book. If you know Kakuro, you can easily finish the whole book and it's not much of a challenge at all, not worth the full price. If you're new to Kakuro, you might enjoy this book."
5,GREAT read,I am a new owner of Gerbils and this is the 2nd book I got to get more information on the adorable little animal. It's a great book with lots of great information and pictures. I really enjoyed the mini questionaires in this book.
2,Knives do not cut well.,"The blades on these knives are BADLY designed: instead of cutting a steak, it ties to tear it apart, and it does a horrible job at that. Don't waste your money on these knives."
2,dubious quality,"I just received these today and must comment on the lack of quality.The storage case looks like it was made and then inspected in the dark. The knives are very light in weight and cut Swiss cheese adequately.As previous reviewers have said, let the buyer beware.Overall, Amazon should drop PINZON products as ""their"" housebrand.The various PINZON products that I have purchased do not live up to the hype nor the overall quality of the Amazon service."
4,Nice Set,"I purchased these for comercial use, hesitant about how they would hold up. After 6 months of daily use through a comercial dish washer, they have far exceeded my expectations. In fact, I'm back to purchase more."
4,inexpensive knives,"If you are looking for a nice, inexpensive set of knives, look no further. This set is very sharp, cuts well and fits into your hand nicely. They have great balance and apperance. The box is a little cheap feeling and looking, but allows for a great storage within a drawer or cabinet."
3,Great knives; beautiful box; faulty clasp!,"It is a shame this box does not stay closed. Fine if you keep it on the counter or in a drawer from which you can open the box, but too bad for gifting and for storage."
3,VERY lightweight,"But functional. Great for the kids, easy to use. The kids did fight over the great box that they came in....maybe next time they will put more emphasis on the cutlery and less on the package!"
5,Ecstasy,"What can I add? I even don't know the Watts/Schippers 2nd concerto, but the Gilels/Ormandy 1st alone is enough to carry my five stars. Ormandy had a rare ability to let his soloists be carried away with the music and around middle of the first movement Gilels reaches ecstasy! How perfectly boring the much praised Argerich/Dutoit sounds, compared to this performance!"
4,Fun show,Picked up the DVD's on a whim (season 1 and 2 together) and really enjoyed them. They were shipped quickly and in my grubby little paws faster then expected
1,Writen for children or BY children?,"With a story line that doesn't flow well at all, this book appears to have been written by a child rather for a child."
3,Not so golden,"The Little Golden Book edition of this wonderful story does it an injustice: not all the pages from the original are included, and those that are are reduced in size. Try and find the original if you can."
5,Five Stars for the original edition!,"We have a copy of this book that has long since lost it's cover, and the lines from the first two (missing!) pages were scrawled in the margin by my mother some forty years ago. This is my own archetypical adventure, as I hope it will become for my children! I am happy to have a new copy for the kids to thrash, but join me in petitioning Golden Books to publish the original, including the missing drawings and text."
4,The Little Sailor Dog Who Could!,"This Little Golden Book was first published in 1953 and introduced me to two loves of my life: the art of Garth Williams and little bitty houses made by amateurs. When I wanted to remodel my own house I feared that it would be beyond my capabilities until my dad pointed out that everything is made up of individual pieces - from a simple pair of pliers to the space shuttle. One piece at a time. Of course, it's handy if someone can hold up the other end of a board while you knock in a nail at your end, but it's still just one board at a time, one nail at a time. The Sailor Dog did just that. He used of what he found and made a shelter for himself - all by himself. The lesson I learned as a child was this: if he can do it, I can probably do it, too."
5,Warm hearted silly adventures .,"I remembered this being read to/with me when I was a pre-schooler in the early fifties. I have strong memories of the art work as warm and secure images. Seeing them again fifty plus years later showed me why, they are outstanding! I had forgotten the plot, which is silly and fun to read aloud. More positive than most nursery plots, and with an independent well anthropomorphized canine hero."
3,Shortened But Still Good,"The Sailor Dog was my favorite book growing up. I remember it fondly as I looked at the pictures imagining a world where dogs sailed the ocean or flew planes and went on grand adventures. I have ordered the orginal in the past from Amazon for a local book drive and got what I expected. On this recent order which was for our 2 year old who loves both books and dogs I got the Little Golden Book edition. Remember those wonderful small books with the gold spine? This edition, however, was not the same Sailor Dog of my childhood. It is an edited version without some of the pages. If you are looking for the original, keep looking. Otherwise this is a fun book."
4,"""When Women Go Wrong, Men Go Right After Them!""","That about sums up the plot of ""She Done Him Wrong"", starring the hip swerving Mae West as barroon chanteuse Diamond Lou. There's not a man in the picture who isn't lusting after Lou, and she lets more than one have a sampling of some of her charms. But while there are double entendres ricocheting off the chandeliers, Mae is always clad, and promises more than she really delivers. She's something of a two-timer, maybe even a five-timer, but you don't hold it against her as she says what needs to be said at the moment. Counterfeiters, white slavers, and jailbreakers round out some of the extra-Mae activities.Watch this funny movie--she may have done him wrong, but she'll serve you right."
4,Come Up And See Her Some Time,"This was the first Mae West film I have seen, and I was curious to see if she would live up to her reputation. She did. West stars as Lou, a singer with a penchant for diamonds and men. She's mixed up with a bunch of white slave traders and crooks. West has a wisecrack for everything, and more than enough male admirers to keep her busy. But the one guy she wants, she can't seem to get, and that's do-gooder Cary Grant, the recipient of her famous ""Come up and see me sometime"" line that has made her immortal in films. West has a great screen presence and she exudes sexuality. She must have been a shock to Thirties film audiences. The film moves along briskly (it's just over an hour), and the dialogue really keeps your attention, as does Mae. The lady had a way with words."
4,Utah's Green River,"A very good book. The information was fairly current and the advice on guides, float trips and conditions was accurate. I would recommend it to anyone contemplating fishing the Green River."
4,This includes the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest!!,"The 2000 slam dunk contest showcased a 20 year old T-Mac, a rookie Steve-O Franchise, and a second year Vince Carter. Everyone knows that Carter burst into the scene with this one, taking home the trophy. Not to be outdone was Steve-O, who placed second with his acrobatic jams. T-Mac assisted VC on his perfect 50 dunk, the one that prompted TNT's Kenny Smith to yell ""It's over, it's over!!"" and was an instant classic.The rest of the DVD shows highlight reel slams, 2004's best jams, the rookie game dunkathon from 2004, and includes a bonus music CD. I don't like Clue, unfortunately he is the host, so it is only 4 stars. Otherwise this is a getter."
4,so....what's next?,"not quite as good as soft bulletin, but still a very high quality record. i think i'm going to put it in right now. i can't get enough of the first song (excellent cat stevens rip-off though it is). anywho, it looks like they're going the way of radiohead. only--and this is a very important distinction--they haven't forgotten that their fans like catchy songs. lots of electronic stuff here, but all tasteful. reminds me strongly of tortoise. and wayne's voice makes sure that you don't take it too seriously...thom should take notes."
4,flaming lips; an original band.,"again the lips take a theme and it winds its way thru the songs. crazy sci-fi stuff w robots who are aware they don't have feelings. creative arrangements with crazy sounds create great atmospheric landscapes, and originality out the wazoo. for those who like something different. it definitely takes more than 1 listen for something as different as this.i love this record."
4,Excellent,"How does a great musician follow an orchestral masterpiece,The Soft Bulletinand an album you need four stereos to play,Zaireeka.One way is to take a step back, write some really good songs. Then take what you have learned, apply it, but do so on a smaller scale. Make a fantastic rock and roll album. That is what the Flaming Lips have done here.If not for Soft Bulletin, there would be nothing small scale about this album. The lips did not invent melodic pop, but they sure have updated it well. Robots is full of nice little accustic tracks, lovingly dipped in orchestrations, sound effects, wonderful melodies and vocal tracking. This is a wonderful ""little"" album, like the best pop, more complex and layered than you first realize."
4,Tender tweakings,"With the exception of a few meandering segments in its latter half, Yoshimi remains the pinnacle of Lip's art-vs-commerce dichotomy. All the organic electronica steering these proceedings seemed more forced initially than what the years have kindly bestowed- providing incisively produced, and of course heartfelt written, melodies that stick."
5,Great Album!,This album has such a beautiful continuity to it. It's sonically beautiful and melodic. It's my favourite of theirs.
2,More Fool You,"This record stinks. And that doesn't surprise me, because the Lips have always been a pretty weak band -- an uncomfortable (and artistically false, I should add) mixture of bong-fed ambition and palpable self-consciousness. Although even I have to admit that they've done a fairly good job (up until this fiasco, of course) of, um, rising above (covering up?) their shortcomings in the past -- this is my way of saying that The Soft Bulletin is a pretty cool record. But ...Pink Robots is not. And I think you can safely bet your last roach that their next record won't be great, either. The men behind the curtain have been exposed as giggling entertainers (at best), but not artists."
3,Not what I'm used to,The band has gone techno...nothing like Transmissions from the satellite heart or Hit to Death in the future head. Why can't bands who make it stick with what got them there? Some of the drums sound like a machine..
1,theyre like evil robots dude,"wow, brilliant idea. this is what happens when you run out of ideas. there is not one interesting melody on this album. no effort was put into this. anyone can sit down with the right electronic equipment and make these sounds and overdub meaningless words without melody. these tunes are completely lifeless and the concept.. what concept? robots? there is no concept. this album is a farce. ...The only tune here with a melody is the 1st track, after that this album meanders into complete boredom."
1,Yoshimi Record Damage,"My first Yoshimi record was sent in a box about two inches too small, not only was the case damaged but the record itself was warped. I voiced my concerns and ordered a replacement. The replacement was shipped in the same size box and was also warped. Customer service was less than helpful and I'm still disappointed I wasted my time and money in the whole ordeal. Buyer beware."
2,I sure can tell they are from Oklahoma,"I bought this CD strictly on it's fantastic cover art. Comeon, we all do that from time to time. The music itself mimicsan Air album I purchased years ago but then the blind melon type voice kicked in I knew this was more of thattwangish-country-folkrock 90's stuff. The sound thathas whole rural radio stations devoted to it.As a first time listener to this album I tried to listen but wasforced to hit the forward button at each repetitious lyric, stuff like ""yoshimi get your yellow kung fu robot something or another"" repeated 16x's.But I've been more into Fantastic Plastic Machine, Stereolab, Defazz, Ben Folds, Roxy Music. I realize there will be Spin magazine awards shows praising these guys but I'm still not getting it."
1,The only good thing on this album,"is a melody that turns out to be a direct rip of a Cat Stevens song! At least they got sued for it. Way to go, Cat (I mean, Yusef)! This band is the biggest bunch of charlatans on the scene today. Perfect music for simple minded, easily fooled yuppies and wanna be yuppies to listen to on the way to Ikea. Blech. The emperor is officially desnudo. And certainly don't make the mistake of seeing this band live: all the confetti, romper room characters and fake blood in the world can't make up for a complete and utter lack of talent (especially vocally). The success and acclaim of bands like this and the Arcade Fire and films like Donnie Darko or Requiem for a Dream will never cease to baffle me."
4,The Lips are Back!!!,"I haven't listened to the Lips since their cd with ""She Don't Use Jelly"" on it. So I decided to listen to this cd. Track 3 was the first track I listened to. That song is one of those songs that gets stuck in your head all day.This album, to me, is classic Lips at their best. Doesn't sound anything like Radiohead (which I personally dislike), or Coldplay (which im my view is the absolute worst group to come in to existence."
4,Quirky,"Several really really great tracks here, but 2 of the songs don't gel. One is just a bunch of yelling and discordant noise and that has been done a million times starting with the Velvets. The CD as a whole tells a narrative that is both tongue-in-cheek and broadway-musical-esque. The singing is great most of the time. I find myself listening to it a lot but I still don't like the some of the slower sadder ballads, even if they are not meant to be taken 100% seriously."
4,great,"this album definately isnt for everyone. but if you have trouble finding anything good on the radio and/or you are a flaming lips fan you should check this one out. you can listen to the entire cd on their website www.flaminglips.com before you buy it to decide if its right for you. another thing i have seen many comparisons to other bands and genres.this is not anything like trip hop.it is not like Radiohead or Bjork either, to me anyway. Although those bands are great. Flaming Lips are beyond classifications. the only reason i gave this four is because five stars is given out too much"
3,Ehh,I think it's a nice cd to put on for background noise... but that's about it unfortunately. I can't say I was all that impressed.
5,One of their best albums,"'Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots' is certainly one of The Flaming Lips' best albums. It isn't as ""hardcore"" as some of their other albums regarding the electronic part of the music. The title track, ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 1,"" actually has predominant acoustic guitar instrumentation. Many of the songs are upbeat and cheery, and I highly recommend this album if you are not familiar with the band but would like to try them out.This vinyl edition exhibits the artwork in very good quality, and the actual vinyl is a transparent red color. My only reservation is that the label in the center of the record does not list the songs on each side, but it is fashionable with some bands."
4,Flaming Lips Yoshimi Review,"The Flaming Lips incorporate electronic and acoustic elements to create a sound that is quirky, unique, and memorable. Lyrically, this album evokes themes of love, death, beauty, and the significance of what it means to be human. While the music can occasionally become murky, generally the Lips do a masterful job balancing disparate instrumental styles into a blend that at times is reminiscent of early David Bowie or Pink Floyd. While it is an acquired taste perhaps, it is worth a listen or two for those who have grown weary of the pablum formula rock that is all too prevalent on the radio today."
3,not exactly OM- more like umm,"Very colorful and imaginitive. Sometimes feels like they are trying too hard to be different- but there are other times when it is just plain original (the differences can be subtle).Overall, it is very fresh sounding- like ""fresh"" cotton candy. It depends if you have a sweet tooth."
2,Borrowed Tunes,"Other reviewers have pointed out that the first track pretty much borrows its melody straight from Cat Steven's ""Father & Son"". No one, however, seems to have mentioned that the only other track with a discernable melody to it , Track 3, lifts it's tune straight from the the 70s America hit ""I Need You"". Other than that, a lot of uninteresting studio sound effects & competely inane lyrics amount to nothing too significant going on here. Although I like experimental, trippy, psychadelic-type music, this one misses the mark. Syd Barret they are not."
3,MUSIC VERY NICE BUT THEIR WORDS HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I like the Flaming Lips so I was excited to get this new album. The music is very nice as I expected, but there are many words in the songs about this ""character"" yoshimi ""taking lots of vitamins"" to fight robots and such for example that I find very annoying. I heard this is supposed to be a concept album, but a better lyrical execution of the concept would have improved matters greatly. I still think it's worth getting for the music alone however."
5,"Wowee, what a cool album !!!!!","This album is great!! I'd say the best album of 2002. It's nice to see a band like the Lips continue to write great songs. They are geniuses. Rock on, baby!!!"
4,My Generation's Dark Side of the Moon,"Having only known this group for their novelty hit, ""She Don't Use Jelly,"" I had no idea what I was in store for when I went to Harvard to party and have some herbal refreshments with a friend of mine. What I heard that night changed my life and made me run to Newbury Comics yesterday to buy this awesome CD. While it may be best enjoyed with some enhancements, it stands on its own just fine, with the help of one of the most clever songs in the history of pop music, ""Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1"" and the opening ""Fight Test"". The hypnotizing ""Are You A Hypnotist??"" and ""Do you Realize??"" are both spellbinding and breathtaking. I won't give this CD an unrealistic (and undeserved) 5 stars but it is definitely one of the best ambient cds of the decade, if not the century)."
5,Believe the hype.... this album rocks,"For once, you can believe the hype. This album is one of the best recorded in 2002, blending techno and pop rock like no other band can (except maybe Radiohead). Very experimental, very thick, and very enjoyable. I give it five stars simply because I can't see any major flaws. If you like this, also check out anything by Wilco."
5,Golden,"That's what this CD is. I bought it as an impulse buy, not really sure what to think of the Flaming Lips, other than that they were eccentric. I popped it into my CD player, and it hasn't left it.The execution of this CD is flawless. Some argue that ""Yoshimi battles the Pink Robots, pt. 2"" is the only poor track on this CD. I disagree. This song is just so different, it doesn't really fit the scheme of the album. The title track is perfect, almost pop-like (definately could get played on the radio) and it's companion is the converse, a rock-like track laden with screaming (is it the robots? Yoshimi? either way, it's flippin' awesome)The other songs are perfect as well. My favorite is ""All we have is Now"" but the obvious gem from the CD, ""Do you Realize?"" (which could pass as a cut song from The Soft Bulletin) is great too.The reviewers who don't give high marks to this don't understand or haven't listened to it enough.Do yourself a favor, buy this CD now. Be a convert like me."
4,"Shimmering, ethereal, beautiful, and then some!","I feel that ""Yoshimi..."" and The Church ""After Everything Now This"", are the 2 strongest candidates for CD of the year! Both are eclectic, masterful, musical masterpieces that balance great songwriting with psychedelia and expression of the first degree. If you are going to buy just 2 CD's this year, make it The Flaming Lips or The Church."
2,Flaming Lips Fall A Long Way From Their Golden Age,"It's sad to say, but although the Flaming Lips last 2 regular length albums are very Dreamy, Echoey, and Well-produced, they fall far short of the southern-noise rock gold that encompassed albums like Clouds Taste Metalic, Hit To Death In The Future Head, Transmissions From The Satelite Heart, and In A Priest Driven Ambulance. Through sharpening up their studio finesse, it seems they may have lost touch with that simple, grungy, happy/sad sound that so many had come to love. This album isn't a BAD album per se,it soars in production, but falls flat on its face in plain old fun."
2,Kinda boring,Most of this album just feels like left overs from the soft bulletin record to me. There is a few decent tracks on this album but nothing really notable. Alot of random studio effects and alot of [...] that just sounds like filler. The Soft Bulletin is far and away a better record along with most of all the previous Flaming Lips albums. If you are new to the Lips I highly suggest starting somewhere else.
3,...,"The first song is close to a note for note rip-off of Cat Stevens' ""Father and Son."" Is this irony? Or just sad?The rest of the CD is OK in a newer-radiohead sort of way, but unfortunately no where near as catchy as the melodythey ""borrowed."""
1,The most OVERRATED release of the past few years!,"This release is WAY overrated IMHO! The music is very cartoonish, with an overabundance of overproduction and ultra-cheesy sound effects! My final analyis is that Coyne and co. perhaps didn't think the music would stand on its own, so they threw in the extra electronica to provide 'icing on the rotting cake'. I want my money back!!"
1,What happened to this once great band?,"if you hoped that ""soft bulletin"" was a one-time excursion into the realm of crappy, you were mistaken. once my favorite band, i now disown them. what happened? i guess it happens to most bands that stay together for a long enough time. wayne has obviously decided that it's more important to be original than it is to play good music. i only pray that the test of time will have this band remembered for the GREAT albums they did produce and not this fluf.(for great albums see: ""a preist driven ambulance"", ""hit to death in the future head"", ""transmissions from the satalite heart"", ""clouds taste metalic"" and ""oh my gawd"")"
2,So what's the fuzz about?,"I was expecting a great and innovative CD (also thanks to the usual enthusiastic reviews on amazon, which I'll learn not to read anymore!)but I was sadly disappointed. I agree with one reviewer before me who said that the first song is ""Father and Son"" by Cat Stevens without the credits, the rest is a band that tries to make something new but really does not manage to! All in all it's not a bad record, just useless. A mix between some electronic music, plus some 70s rock whithout much musical inspiration. Not to mention the lyrics, a 5 years old kid could probably write better stuff. If you write stupid lyrics it does not necessarily mean you're so smart and unconventional, sometimes you just look like a stupid!"
4,Here's to bizarre and beautiful!,"I just listened to this CD for the first time tonight...unbelievable that I am this late.Okay, the Lips don't really need my review, because it looks like Yoshimi is a 4-5 star easily and I am number 319. But, Wayne, how do you come up with this menagerie of music?!?Another reviewer said that he thought you were an accidental genius, I think you are so damn brilliant, you are scary!"
4,"Very good, slightly overhyped","I got this CD hearing the amazing praise this band was recieving. I figured it would have to be a pop gem to keep up with everything thats said about it. Its not. Its a good Cd, don't get me wrong, but it isn't as incredible as some seem to think. There are some amazing tracks on this Cd (""do you realize"", for example) but others, like ""yoshimi battles the pink robots part 2"" are definately not(the afformentioned song was just the sound of a crowd moaning and grunting to guitar riffs). This CD remains good, just not as good as everyone would have you believe."
3,"Not bad, But noTransmissions from the Sattelite heart","When I bought this album I was dissapointed. After hearing transmissions from the Satelite heart I was expecting another pure rock, energetic gem; this was not it. By no means is this a bad album, but given the previous performance and reccording of this band this fell below my expectations. The energy in this album is not as intense. There is not angst, very little anything, just a futuristic sort of narrative. The songs are excellently crafted, they have beautiful guitar and synthesizer, but they don't seem to say anything and are often repetitive or drowned out by drum machines. This album has its moments, but if you want a true gem, look no farther than Transmissions from the Sattelite Heart."
4,Do get Lippy,"Interesting cd. Perhaps a trip to the groups web site will convinence you they are a little out there. I realy like the adventure the group takes us. It's realy tough to carry a theme through a grouping of music. (the sound is like a cross between The Beatles and King Krimson not a bad cross) For the most part the group pulls it off,"
3,Good But Not Great,"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is a good album, eminently listenable, but since when does sounding like ELO earn you alt-rock cred and points for originality? It's fun to listen to, and the melodies will stay with you for a while, but don't listen too hard to the lyrics, which are every bit as unimpressive (and in some cases, cringe-worthy) as The Soft Bulletin.And don't be fooled by twenty-something ""critics"" who think this is some kind of groundbreaking work; those guys have obviously never picked up an ELO, ELP, or Moody Blues album. That's not much of a knock on the Lips, because I like those old bands, in small doses, anyway. But to herald the Lips as ""great artists"" while despising Jeff Lynne is to entirely miss the point."
4,good album!,I liked it a lot. a combination of soft/hard and electronic/melodic. If you like to flow into thoughts about different worlds it also works very well...
5,the flaming lips exhibit their genius,"the flaming lips completely blew me away with this album, it was so cool and strong and just plain showed sonic genius. all people who consider themselves to appreciate music should purchase this."
4,Good- but not their best,"I've been a flaming lips fan for years. Their sound has consistently evolved with each album, and Yoshimi is no exception. Imagine, if you will, Telepathic Surgery melodies set to Casiotone electronic keyboard beats, with some rump-kicking real drums thrown in here and there, and FL's characteristicly weird ""story-lyrics"" and funky guitar, and that almost sums up Yoshimi. If you're already a Lips fan, Yoshimi will probably not disappoint you. If you're not- try one of their earlier albums first because, although this is a good album, it is better when taken in the contex of their larger body of work."
5,One of their best and one of the best of 2002,"This is just a great, quirky, fun record -- the songwriting is good, the performances are good, the choice of instrumentation is really great -- this is what rock should be. If you can conceive of the melodic abilities of Pavement combined with the quirky songwriting of Guided by Voices, and throw in a little Ween and Wilco, you have a bit of an idea of what you'll get here. But Flaming Lips may be the best of the bunch. Oh, below, someone rated it poorly and said it sounds like Neil Young in his Trans phase? Well, there are some to whom that couldn't be higher praise. I agree, and that's why I love the record (and if they want to go on reminding people of Neil Young, who could argue with that?). Really, the only things that link this music to Neil is the strong songwriting, freedom from formula, lively intelligence and strong melodic sense. And that ain't bad at all."
5,album of the year,"I love the Soft Bulletin and In a Priest Driven Ambulance andI love this album. Buy this album and if you have a chancego see them live as well, then gosh darnit do it."
4,I love it...,I absolutely love this cd... It's at least 4 Gold Star material...->Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hellmy fave song/title on itMy friend gave me a copy and as they say better late than never... The music is superb and the lyrics are eccentrically interesting... As well as the vocals smooth nicely over the music...Pick it up and give it a try... You'll like it even if your name isn't Mikey - a Flaming Fan - Savannah Skye...
5,"Less is less, and it's good that way","Oh-oh, yoshimithey don't believe methat you won't let thoserobots eat mewhat more could you possibly ask for?"
1,lips that know how to [sing],"Whats funny is that many people seem to argue that any negative criticism of this album will surely come from people who are not adventurous enough to accept minimalist guitar and a large helping of synthsizers and electronic sounds, but while i really like the albums that this one is compared to (kid a, ok computer, bjorks later stuff), i really dont like this album's style at all. I guess in keeping with its theme, the flaming lips decided to make these songs sound like something off of the intro or credits to a bad anime cartoon series.. thats about how awkward a lot of these songs come off to me. And yeah, the singers voice is kind of whiny too, like a lot of other people have already mentioned. Maybe their other stuff is better, but its all way too girly for me. It lacks the genuine melancholy and transcendent feeling of a lot of other electronic music you could be listening to today."
2,indie-boys do a mediocre job of trying to be trip-hop,"I really don't understand why this album gets so much hype. It seems like the people that rave about this album only listen to indie-rock and love what the Lips have done with this one. Well guess what? There are at least a hundred other people out there doing this kind of music only better. The people that rave about this album probably have no clue because these other artists are in the ""Techno"" section of their favorite record store. I'd avoid this [...]. To sum up- ""Yoshimi"" is boring and really cheesy at times. There's one song where everytime the guy sings the word ""Future"" they make it sound like he's in a 1960's sci-fi flick. The digital/analog effects aren't enhancing the songs, they're overdone."
2,The Flaming WHAT?,"Yes, at first I was astounded at how different a single band could sound in a world full of packaged [garbage], and if first impressions were everything, I would say that this cd is a definite keeper. So, if you're one of those people who buys a cd and listens once, this cd is for you. It has some catchy riffs and some interesting concepts, until you realize that this is what every Flaming Lips cd is like. They're known for pushing the envelope. This is not nearly as weird as much of the stuff they've put out, which makes it not as effective. As for their live performances of the material (yes, I did see them live, and they were outshined by Modest Mouse and Cake), it was disturbing to say the least. They're a studio band, and a poor one at that."
1,Problem with Amazon site.,"This is not a review of the album. I intended to listen to the sample of the first song but hit the wrong button and bought it by accident. The site used to show the ""Are you sure"" page, but not this time. Couldn't find any way to un-buy it. Couldn't find any way to e-mail Amazon on this issue, so I came here, to the reviews, to voice my displeasure.Amazon, I have not downloaded or listened to that track. Please undo that buy."
4,pyschedelia here i come!!!!!,"i can;t remember how i got into the lips...or really, this cd, but i think i downloaded Fight Test and fell in love... finally bought the cd ( after d/l a couple other tracks) and put it in rotation.. on first listen i was like, this guy has GOT to be kidding! left it in there, and pretty soon, i was anticipating every movement, singing along, basically absorbing the cd. it;s some fun music, and totally enjoyable... this is one of these cds you either you love or you hate... introduced my friend to them, and he's all into this cd tooTracks 1,2,6,7,9 and 11 are outstanding, which by no means the others are filler...sometimes after singing along/Listening to this, I get such a great feeling, i wonder if this is sonic LSD..LOL... nah, just kidding.."
4,SUPERBLY ELECTRIC,The new flaming Lips album shocked me. I was surprised about the depth the music takes you. The CD takes you where it goes. Yoshimi would have been proud to hear this Album because it's originality and rythm takes you home.
5,It's from outerspace and that's where I'm going . . .,"Never heard anything by the Flaming Lips but ""She Don't Use Jelly"" before ""Do You Realize"" came out. Never much cared. Based on that single I bought the record. I've played it nonstop for two days. Techno-psychedelia from a band that clearly understands guitar-based songwriting. Wow. All I can say is it makes me want to jettison my skin and go supernova."
5,Cyber- punk at its best...,"I first bought this album after only knowing the song She Don't Use Jelly, which seems to be their one big commercial release and the only song most Lips laymans know. At first, i didn't know what to think...all the effects and samples were confusing and jumbled and the vocals seemed to be lost underneath. I put it aside and promptly forgot about it. Rummaging through my collection one day, i thought, why not? Ever since then i haven't been able to stop listening to it...what at first seems jumbled and confusing becomes beautifully complex and layered, and the amazing lyrics really shine, finding a firm place in Cyber-punk culture (possibly the best musical contribution i've heard). Basically it's amazing and i have to agree with all the other reviewers when they say that Do You Realize is briliant...it breaks and remakes your heart at every listen...do yourself a favour and give it a chance..."
5,I am NEVER getting rid of this album!,"I think that, like some other reviewers, this album took me a while to get used to. But after a few listenings, the songs have become some of my favorites. The quality of the lyrics rivals Robert Hunter at his best, and the instrumentals are new and creative without being too wierd. Give it a chance, and really listen to it, and I think you will love it.By the way: before you die, make sure you see the Lips in concert. It's...awesome."
5,Great Re-Release,"I owned the original first pressing on black vinyl, and I think I like this one better. The record itself is pressed on Red Vinyl and it's very thick, not a 180 gram pressing but a very high quality record. I'm very impressed with this, and it's gonna be very rare and highly collectable."
3,I loved it .... I think.,Imagine Neil Young and Brian Wilson getting together to record a tribute to the Allan Parsons Project. Or maybe Beck and John Lennon doing their best Pink Floyd. I love this album ... I think.
4,"Good, but","Great recipes, great stories, but whats with the ""old"" style layout of this book? seems so 1980's. Other than that its a pretty good book."
3,"Nearly 100% seafood, except for dessert","Before I'd ordered this book, I wish I'd known that with the exception of the dessert recipes, just about every recipe in the volume is a seafood recipe. I had been hoping for non-seafood salad and appetizer recipes to pair with seafood main courses. My fault for not checking."
2,not really what i was expecting,"Hello everybody,here two lines about this book, too much housewife focused, i was expecting some good tips or any suggestion that can be implemented in a professional environment. Maybe could help if you can highlight clearly the target of clientele."
5,It made me a great chef!,"Simply, the recipes all work. The first recipe I made was a relatively simple shrimp dish. My 13 year old (not a purveyor usually of haute cuisine) said ""those are the best shrimp I ever had"". It was true. Cooking lobster in cognac led to similar raves from the guests. I can't duplicate the room of my favorite NY restaurant, but I have yet to produce a dud from this book."
3,Eat the meat and spit out the bones.,"Not exactly what I thought when I got it.Lots of little stories and andecdotes. Very colloquial too. Good for someone recently reborn or that wants to begin leading a better life. If you are beyond that, then you are probably beyond this particular book. Chapters include; Patience?, growing thru annoyances, bearing with adversity and other people, achieving inner peace, love, enduring for the sake of others and eternity , perseverance, and living in hope. All about character building through life's trials. 127 pages"
3,Doesn't smell like vanilla,"So this doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't smell like vanilla to me. There's more vanilla underneath the strong cinnamon smell in Pinaud's Bay Rum."
5,Good smell,I agree with other revues that it doesn't have that vanilla smell like a candle but a hint of vanila it does smell crisp and good. When you splash it on you feel clean and refreshed.
1,Dog piss mixed with vomit with a hint of lime,"I cannot believe this is out on the market, and even more shocked that people actually like this and consider it a sophisticated scent. I'm not a huge fan of the original Clubman, but that is 1000x better than whatever this is supposed to be."
1,Vanilla?,I like Amazon don't get me wrong. I have no issue with getting what I ordered. I like Clubman; I currently use the bay rum. I thought I would try this because I like the smell of vanillla. Man..this smells like 3 in one oil. It looks like 3 in one oil and even feels like it to the touch. If you need to grease a squeak then this is perfect but if you want aftershave lotion then stick to the bay rum.
3,One of Pinaud`s Aftershaves,I like this company but this particular fragrance was just OK. Somehow the Vanilla scent was not that evident and thus I received less then optimum pleasure.
4,"Pleasant Smell, works to sooth a battered face.","I have not used after shave in 20 years, so I am a born again virgin on this product type.The Clubman Vanilla after shave is not really overly vanilly in smell, that is OK. Smells nice, rolls on easy.I do notice that my post shave routine is soothed by using aftershave to ease the nicks and such. I have recently switched over to Double Edge safety razor on the toss away multiple head shavers. The DE Safety razors are very sharp, and nicks now occur, were they were seldom on the duller toss aways. So a good after shaved seemed a worthy product to try, and it works. I guess granpa was pretty smart after all.Why 4 stars, not 5 - I only 5 for truly outstanding products. This is very good, and recommended."
5,Pinaud Always Comes Through,"I tried this particular fragrance to offset the Lilac Vegetal first used in Danang ""back in the day."" I like this product and have had some interesting complements on it at school. Some of the Asian students recognize it immediately. Another good choice for our desert heat-sink summers."
3,not bad,I found the book to be very informative but not so much for an online student. I also found the writing a little small. I think Carol Delaney should keep the book because of the wealth of information but modify it for online students.
4,Really! And you see the whole set up.,"I was glad this was not just a picture book (but would have been just as happy if it had, since the illustrations were fullfilling the title admirably). I've followed David Travis in his publications and enjoy his writing.Taken by Design is a good testament to successful training in setting up a shot and trying different things to convey the 'message.' It is a real pleasure to read and look at."
4,A very good chlorophyll liquid,"Out of four different brands I've tried so far, this is my second favorite, but my daughter's favorite. It has a strong mint flavor, so you won't get any of the ""grassy green"" undercurrents you will with others--a plus for my daughter, but I don't like for the mint to be so overpowering. This is also a very low sodium formula, so if you're watching your salt or are unaccustomed to eating a lot of it, this is a great product. The bottle is easy to use and hold, and the pour spout is way less messy than any others I've used so far--easy to squeeze and easy to control the flow so you won't make a mess (the straight liquid stains quickly!) I will drink this one when I'm in the mood for more mint, I do like it a great deal, it just isn't my favorite."
5,Good for heartburn,"I got it initially because I heard it stops your breath/sweat from smelling, Idk I never stopped using deoderant because of this product but I do use it when I go to the gym and it 1. soothes my stomach while I work out, sometimes when I do activities my indigestion kicks in2. tastes good, I drink water all day so it's a refreshing treat3. slightly reduces odor if used over time. It's no miracle worker and if you want results with the body odor you have to use it every single day and maybe a little more than one tsp."
5,Perfect Portable Intruder Alarm,"When my wife and I are apart due to business trips, etc., she is very nervous about being alone at night. She worries about an intruder breaking in and her not waking up in time to protect herself. I bought this alarm as a simple temporary device until I could install a more sophisticated unit. It turns out that this device is so simple to use and effective (very loud alarm) that my wife said this is all she needs to feel comfortable that she will have ample warning if an intruder ever enters the house. The unit can be mounted on a wall or set on a shelf or staircase and the swivel seeker head allows easy adjustment to cover the area to be scanned. It is impossible to sneak by this unit."
5,KAR KALIM,Kar Kalim is a great book. It's full of real emotion as well as adventure. I could see myself in Inya and her conflict between emotion and duty is very believable. I am certainly going to purchase future novels by this author.
3,"Its ""Near"" the Real Thing","""The Coca-Cola Company: An Illustrated Profile of a Worldwide Company"" is a short and highly enjoyable history of this American Icon, written and published by the company itself in 1974. A treasure trove of old ""Coke"" ads. Though not enough to satisfy a true history buff. See perhaps ""For God, Country, and Coca-Cola: The Definitive History of the Great American Soft Drink and the Company That Makes It"" by Mark Pendergrast for the ""Real Coke."" ""The Real Thing: Truth and Power at the Coca-Cola Company"" by Constance L. Hays is a much more powerful ""warts and all"" coverage of Coca-Cola's history."
1,SO HORRIBLE!!!,I bought these little speakers to replace the blown factory speakers in my fiero... They sounded the same! They rattle and pop with treble and bass! ALSO they did NOT fit the oem holes... they suck DO NOT BUY!
5,The richest storytelling venue available today...,"Don't be fooled by the derisive comments that your goth buddies give you about this 'combat game.' Werewolf: the Apocalypse is IMO the most personally challenging venue White Wolf has published for storytelling (followed closely by Mage). Buy the book, enjoy, and find a sophisticated group of friends who can help you along! We have more info on our AOL website"
4,VERY HELPFUL!,This screen has helped me since I bought the second addition of werewolf A must have for first time and veteran players.
3,Not as good as some,"It could use some work. I personally think that the Garou are a wee bit to strong. I loved it though, and am buying the rest of the supplements for the WOD, which is NOT real."
5,Maytag Water Filter Good,"Filter worked great. Water back to tasting good. I waited until the fidge warning light came on to change which could be a bit longer than necessary, so don't hesitate to change before it tells you to."
5,refrig water filter,Great product; does exactly what you need and fit perfectly into our refrigerator space for a water filter. Makes the water taste really pure.
5,Nice Filters,"Hate to spend so much on a filter, but this was the best price and they shipped quickly!"
5,Great service and great price,I got my filter within a week and the price was much cheaper than through the Maytag site.
4,Worked as expected,Filter installed without issue. And getting 3 for a much better price than I could locally was worth it (even after the shipping costs).
3,maytagUKF8001,This filter did not last as long as the one i bought from sears .i am not sure why!!!GOOD LUCK
5,Pleased with the filter,"Easy to install. The water tastes ""funny"" for the first few gallons (and that is after we wasted 4-5 gallons through it). Now that it has run through several gallons things taste great, the filter makes a great connection with the fridge and everything works perfectly."
3,Whirlpool replacement filter,"This is a very expensive item for what you get, and it certainly doesn't last as long as they say it does. The taste of your water coming through this filter is great for the first month or so, but then the quality drops noticeably quick.I think the price of this item is unfairly high, but once you buy a refrigerator that needs them, you're stuck. You either buy the filter or put up with nasty tasting water from your refrigerator spigot.A good rule of thumb, if you're buying one filter, better buy two, because you'll need a new one quicker than you think."
5,Filter Perfect,Filter was shipped very quickly and was very easy to replace. This is the first time that I needed to replace the filter so I wasn't sure what I was getting into. It was very quick and easy.
5,New Filter,"Not much that i can say on a filter, but it was exactly what i ordered and it fit perfectly in our refrigerator."
3,"Nice Internet Price, but Short Life.","These Water filters are super expensive to buy at local stores($45-$50), but at least you can find them on the internet for around $32 with shipping. My refrigerator light will usually stay green for around 7 months, but I'll keep it for at least a year. When you water flow gets weak, you know it's time to change the filter."
5,Works fine,"The product was exactly what we needed. I think that the filters are expensive no matter where you get them, but at least they were cheaper here."
5,Perfect.,"Used this in my Kenmore/Amana bottom freezer we bought in 2004. The original filter was $60. This one works perfectly at less than half the price. I got good water flow back, and boy is it tasty! And delivery only took a couple of days."
5,As Advertised,I received the filter as advertised in good shape in good time and measure. Recommend this supplier and product.
5,Satisfied customer,This order was packaged very efficiently and shipped in good time. I would certainly use this seller again. Thank you!
5,Easy to install,Snap to install and filters the water as it's supposed to. The Jenn-Air counter depth fridge is amazing. I would never have a deep side-by-side again.
5,Review of a water filter,"I recently ordered and received a Maytag UKF8001AAX PuriClean II Refrigerator Cyst Reducing Water Filter 1-Pack. I got it, installed it, and it works. That's my review.Patrick CurtisParker, CO"
5,PuriClean II water filters,"Filters are exactly what I wanted, shipped on time and in perfect condition. Price was the best deal I could find online. Filters last me & my husband about 6-9 months. I hope I'll be able to find them when I need them again. Will defiently recommend to a friend. Thanks"
2,didn't get what was shown in the picture,The original PuriClean II filter that came with my Maytag has been discontinued and the new filters are not the same as the old ones. I thought I was buying the discontinued model when I purchased this and ended up getting the newer ones. THe new ones do not work the same and slow down the flow of water considerably. Wish I could still get the old ones!
5,no problems,The ordering process on Amazon was easy to follow and I received the filter in the time it specified with no problems.
4,Good Filter,"Pros: Water pressure in the faucet on my fridge is greatly improved. My ice maker is making solid cubes again.Cons: The 'new filter' taste took a couple of weeks to go away, but I guess that's normal so it really shouldn't be a con."
2,PuriClean II Filter of Poor Quality,The quality of water from the new filter is of very poor quality and is no where close to what I got from the original filter of the same model and type which came with the refrigerator.
1,Maytag Puriclean Filter,I gave this product only one star because the light on my fridge does not acknowledge that a new filter was installed and is still showing that the filter needs to be replaced. Clearly this product was faulty.
1,"BEWARE, THIS FILTER POLLUTES WATER","I bought set of 3 filters from Amazon about 2 month ago and immediately installed one filter into my fridge. After a few days of usage my wife pointed my attention that water coming out the fridge contains tiny, almost invisible flakes. I think it some sort of internal filtering staff coming out of the filter. I tried to use another filter from the set with the same result - flakes. Just think for a second those flakes are actually some sort of chemically active reagents and we have to drink that water!!!"
1,Never got it!,I never had a chance! I have emailed seller at least 5 times and no reply. I must now place a claim to Amazon--I know I'll at least get a response. DO NOT BY FROM maryandnancysoddends!!!!!!!!!!
1,Watch the SHIPPING!,"I bought one of these last time I needed one. I actually used the link from my previous order to put this in my cart again. The first time I got it, shipping was under $5. Somehow this time, by the time I was on the last page of purchase, shipping charges were nearly $60 (?!?)! Obviously, I'm not purchasing this product from this seller at this time. I'm hoping it's just some sort of glitch. If not, it's a serious rip-off."
1,Overpriced replacement filter,"This water/ice filter isn't bad as a compact , easy to change system but the price for replacements is at least $33 each. This consumer product method compares to men's shavers and other products with proprietary fixtures where you can only use their brand.I wish they allowed for comparison shopping, however an external inline water filter system is also expensive where the replacments cartridges are around $85 each.I hope to eventually have a whole house system and not need these band aid type products."
2,Disappointed this time,I have purchased this same water filter numerous times and this time was not very good. Don't know why?
5,Nice filter,It was easy taking the old one out and putting the new one in. The water tastes good again!
5,Water Filters are A OK Amazon had best prices over anyone,"Amazon.com had the item in stock, was easily the cheapest of all online comparisons for a standard water filter that has several applications, I use these filters on the cold water from the refrigerator. Note: Not Amazons fault but filters do not last as long as it says on the box. I get about two to three months from them and the mfg. box says 6 months.Amazons delivery is super fast even at ground rates it could be I am near a distribution center as i usually get the item the next day, without the premium postage. 5 Stars to amazon.com 3 stars for the filters."
5,Water filter,I received the filter quickly with no billing issues. The filter was easy to install and is working perfectly!!
2,Didn't get what I ordered,"I thought we were ordering the Maytag UKF8001 PuriClean II filter, BUT the dealer sent a filter used as a replacement - fits fine, but does NOT purify the water as well as the one I requested. They sent the PUR filters. Thought I was getting one product and the seller sent me another. Won't buy online for filters again - I'll pay Home Depot the extra 5 dollars."
5,Does what it is supposed to do,"This does exactly what it's supposed to do. Removal and installation were very easy, there was no loud pop like there was when we removed the cap that was on the fridge from the factory. I put a small dishtowel right under the filter when we removed it and it caught the little amount of water that came out.We had replaced the filter after about 1 year with no significant performance reductions. We did not notice a reduction in flow, or any particulate matter in the water. However when I drained the water out of the old filter there was a ton of black specs that came out. Just FYI, our household only consists of 2 people but we regularly drink a couple of glasses per day. I think most couples should be able to get a year out of the filter."
4,Great Product,The product was great. It installed easily and simply into our Maytag refrigerator. No complaints and worked as expected with good clean water.
2,I don't get it??,Why is it more expensive to buy 2 filters versus one?(Usually there is a savings if you buy bulk)
5,Whirlpool Refrigerator Ice and Water Filter,"The filter works great. We definitely notice a difference between tap water and filtered water from the refrigerator. The filter is a little difficult to install, but once it is in place it lasts almost a year. We saved money by buying the filter on Amazon. We plan to continue to purchase our filters through Amazon."
1,What have they done?,They changed this filter. The flow rate is way below what is specified - less than half. Customer support was of no use. My local dealer was no help. My wife is going nuts. You cannot use the thing as it takes forever to draw a quart of water. They are meeting some new spec and have cut the life from a year to 6 months. I am working on my own modifications to the filter as this is unacceptable.The flow is great with the bypass device in place so it is not the valve. This is the second of these 6 month filters I have had and they both are awful if you want more than a cup of water. There may not be an alternative on the market but letters so letters to the company - Maytag - are in order.
5,Love my filtered water!,This item has been impossible to find locally and is now (apparently) discontinued. I've been delighted to order this item from amazon.com and will continue to do so as long as it is available!
4,saving the planet,Great tasting water and ice right from the fridge. Refill your water bottle thousands of time's without polluting the environment. Great for you and mother earth. Makes water taste better than spring water!
2,kind of expensive for what you get,The flow seems to slow down very quickly and they are kind of expensive. It sometimes feels like bottled water would be cheaper
1,attends booster pads,Does not replace discontinued depends boosts. These are worthless; a couple of sheets of toilet paper would be almost as effective.
5,Make my day go easier!,"I have to take care of elderly family member, but I am new at this I didn't really know much about diapers end of things, but I've tried everything and still the wetness is uncontrollable. First had picked up 12 at Walmart SuperCenter. Those worked, but they never sold them again. No body has them. But Amazon vendor does. So now I just order this case when I need it. Once the order is in I get them quick! Excellent service here by UPS! Easy to insert in the Depends Adult Diaper. Once in there it can last over 8 hours. 16 hours is pushing it has when that gets filled up it becomes heavy and then Depends diaper Super Plus has to kick in. Max one doesn't work so well. This is excellent product to get and it better to buy the case then to just get 20 count only."
3,A Little extra protection,The only complaint I have is that they need a little more adherence to stay in place.
2,Not Up to Expectations,"After all the reviews and hype surrounding this novel, I read it before seeing the movie. I was disappointed in both the novel and the movie. Comparison with William Golding's book, Lord of the Flies leaves The Beach barren. Golding's classic story of the degeneration of civilization among a group of British schoolboys is plausible and frightening. The Beach's attempt to update this theme with present day spoiled rich kids off on holiday is not as successful. To Hodge's credit, he does succeed in capturing the imagery of his setting--I could almost taste the salt of the sea and the see the seediness of the hotel. However, it was not enough to make up for the unimaginative plot development. If you are going to rip off a previous author, especially one of great stature, it takes more than changing the setting and slightly aging the main characters. Or..... maybe I'm just too old to appreciate this book?"
3,"Travel to ""The Beach""","""The Beach"" is one of my favorite books, and now I can say that the screenplay of the film is too.Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an American tourist who is given a map to a paradise island. He sets off with a French couple, but they find that paradise isn't as great as it sounds.Screenwriter John Hodge has a way with great dialogue, and he has a wonderful ability to characterize and gets us to like even the most minor of characters.The scenes are well-written, but we are never overburdened with excessive description. Basically, this screenplay wisely shows us that less really is more. When the beach and the settings are described, we get to imagine as much as we want.If you enjoyed the movie, or like reading good screenwriting, check out this screenplay book. You won't be disappointed."
3,Good overview for the professional caregiver or counselor.,Could be too technical for most families or lay caregivers
4,Well written and a welcome addition to this new field,The book is well written and adds a new dimension to future warfare. The author seems expert in the field. He also tackles some of the tough issues for future national security. Required reading for anyone seriously interested in national defense.
2,"Put me to SLEEP, PLEASE!","I don't care how many credentials or degrees or how informative your information is, but if you start to fall asleep every three or four pages or have to read whole sections over because your mind drifts, then you've missed an essential part of writing and editing. YOU MUST MAKE IT INTERESTING! I read a half dozen books a month and this read like a text book, no worse than a text book. It read like a military manual, JUST like Kirkus reviews says. They were right on target. Fire your editor and get someone with a personality to help you write your next book. The only reason I give it two stars is that the information is there if you can suffer the writing."
3,decent cd,"I listened to the samples on the website and bought the cd on the first day it was released. My favorites are Smooth, Hope Wish and Pray, and Come to Mama (which ironically were the ones sampled on the internet). Many of the songs sound dated though. Like they should have been released back when Ericka Badu was hot. It's a decent cd though."
5,OFF DA CHAIN!!!!,"I DONT CARE WAT ANYBODY SAYS BUT LINA'S SOPHOMORE ALBUM IS FIRE!!! DAT ALBUM IS A GEM FROM START TO FINISH... I WAS WAITING FOR HER FOLLOW UP TO ""STRANGER ON EARTH"" ANXIOUSLY AND HERE IT IS... ITS TRUE THAT HER SOUND HAS BECOME MORE MAINSTREAM BUT THIS ALBUM IS STILL CLASSIC MATERIAL... MY FAVORITE TRACKS ARE:1.PEACE N LOVE... LINA SHINES ON THIS TRACK.2.STORY GOES... LOVE THIS SONG FOR ITS MESSAGE N DA INSTRUMENTATION.3.SMOOTH... BEAUTIFUL SONG4.COME TO MAMA... SEXY N SMOOTH5.IT COULD BE... REFRESHING6.AROUND DA WORLD... BEAUTIFUL DUET7LEAVING YOU... INNER STRENGTH8. HOPE WISH N PRAY... INSPIRINGI LOVE THE REST OF THE TRACKS TOO INCLUDING THE INTERLUDES... Y'ALL NEED TO GIVE THIS WOMAN SOME PROMOTION Y'ALL SINCE THE LABEL IS NOT DOING IT FOR HER... SHE DESERVES RECOGNITION."
3,Not as unique or creative as I thought it would be.,"This album has some very good songs, like ""My Fix"", ""Around The World"" (where we find Anthony Hamilton laying down some of his best vocals ever), ""Come To Mama"" and ""Smooth."" But quite honestly, a lot of the tracks on here are pretty boring, and not as unique and different as I expected. For example, ""Hope, Wish & Pray.""With excellent releases from Hidden Beach records, like Jill Scott's albums, I was expecting more from this CD.(There is a track that wasn't included on this that really should've been, ""The Movement"", which you can download on iTunes.)"
3,Cool Album...,"I think this is a pretty solid lil' album. She's a newcomer to the Hidden Beach roster, and it's pretty evident that the folks over there can bring in new cats to the label and give 'em a good sound.She has some pretty cool tracks on here. Some that stand out are ""I Am"", the Anthony Hamilton duet on ""Around the World"", ""Smooth"", and one of her last few tracks ""Peace and Love"".I think it's more of a female targeted cd. Cool lil' sound. Obvious jazz influence. Yall should check it out though."
4,Sounds more like trip-hop,"Fell in love with her voice and her albums. I wouldn't put her in R&B though, it's way more like trip-hop. She uses all the elements I hear with artists like Esthero, Morcheeba and Sneaker Pimps. I only use then for genre comparsion, she is much better than say Morcheeba who can be uneven in quality. Try her and you'll fall in love too."
1,Our Girls,The book Our Girls was an interesting read. I specifically chose the book to learn more about what Dio Lewis had to say in 1871 about women.The issue I had was the printing was awful. The pages were smudged to the point of not being able to read several of them. Pages were missing. It was not worth the $35 I spent on the book. I contacted Amazon.com to see if they would consider a discount or credit towards other books and received no response.
5,Excellent Puzzle made in USA!,"This is a great puzzle, with excellent construction. Customer service was first rate. I bought this for my son's pre-school class as their classroom present (all they wanted for Christmas was Christmas puzzles). I was worried that the puzzle would not arrive before school let out for the holidays. When I called to explain my predicament, they shipped it out right then and there, and it arrived in time for the children to open. I would be glad to do business with this company again."
2,strange and fascinating-boring and naive,"I read this book a couple of years ago, lead on by HP lovecrafts recommendation. It features one of the most bizarre and fascinating fantastic visions of mankind in an apocalyptic future, millions and millions of years from now. In that area the fiction works. The trouble is all the other components. The author has tried to concoct a love-story of some kind, that unfortunately turns out to be one of the worst I have ever encountered. Unbearably romantic in the worst sense, full of clichés... whatever, you name it. But all in all, if you are a serious dark-fantasy-fanatic, this one might still be worth some while."
2,not as easy as it sounds,I bought this dvd based on what great customer reviews it had but was very disappointed. I am new to exercise and found this dvd much too hard to follow. Although I like her perkiness she moves too quickly without explaining well enough what you are supposed to be doing. I spent most of my time jumping around not quite sure what I was supposed to be doing. The only part I could really keep up with was upper body. Although I think this would be a good video for someone already experienced with an exercise program definitly not for a beginner.
2,Just okay,"I was disappointed in this dvd. I like the upper body and lower body segment. However, the ""techno"" music is annoying and the studio where the video is shot is unappealing to me. An ""abs"" section would have been nice since it is supposedly a ""total workout"". I have bought many many work out videos and I have a pet peeve about them - when you have a cardio section you need to show the instructors legs. You don't need a close up of her face while she is instructing- you need to see what she is doing. Needless to say this dvd shows the instructor talking away from the waist up during challenging cardio steps. I will use it for the arms and lower body but that's it."
5,I great find and just in time :),"As an Amy Dixon dedicatee I found this older dvd from her days with Womens' Health and snapped it up! It turns out to be one of my best moves yet cos this dvd rocks!! It is quick and fun, with the same gals from Ultimate Fat Burner and an easier option to follow as well if needed. The exercises have not dated and we found it a fun challenge and one to choose on a day where we are already beat and just want a quick and effective work-out. This gets my vote!!"
4,Whoah!,"This workout was a little too much for me. I work out regularly, but usually to Denise Austin, Leslie Sansone or Chris Freytag videos. The first time I did it wasn't too bad, but the second time I felt like I had hurt or pulled some body part! I will say that it's a fun workout though, not boring at all - and short! I liked Amy Dixon too; she was easy to follow and always let you know what she was doing next. I would probably recommend it for someone younger than me (do I have to say how old I am?!) that wants a good, short workout."
5,I have used this video more than any other,"When I could not get through the 10 minute ab routine on the ball, I knew I was on to something with this one. I judge my fitness level by doing the 10 min ab routine -- if I can get through the whole 10 mins, I'm doing good!I've been looking for something more intense, and went to the library and got some dance videos. The first one was too complex. The 2nd one was too jumpy. So I grabbed my Total workout in ten and did the 2 cardio workouts, and that was JUST RIGHT! Moves were not so complex that I got no workout, and not too jumpy that it destoyed my knees. It may not be Turbo Jam, but you can get a workout from this video."
5,Totally Refreshing!!,"This video is really great for beginners and intermediates. The 10 minutes workouts of each section (cardio, upper body, lower body, and stretch) are just enough to make you keep going and not want to quit. Good work out for a tight schedule!"
5,Best ever workout,I am an avid exerciser and like to vary my workouts regularly. I often review what isout there and try to choose something a bit different but something that includes cardioand strength training. It is always a gamble as to whether you will like it of course.Total Workout in Ten with Amy Dixon (amazing instructor)proved very worthwhile. You can dothe whole 40 minutes consecutively or break it down into 10 minute segments. I always feelenergized in the end. I even ordered for my 28 year old daughter (I'm a grandmother) andshe loves it also. Looking to order another video with Amy Dixon.
5,Amy,"This is a fun video. You work hard, and you sweat, but I have fun with this workout. Helped to increase my strenght nd stamina."
1,Flawed and with Shameless Ads (as always with Rodale),"I just received Total Workout In Ten and was immediately disgusted by Rodale's shameless advertising. (It's not about fitness with them, only making money.) This DVD is supposed to save you time, but it makes you sit through 10 minutes of ads (because they don't let you fast-forward) before getting to the exercise. And the DVD must be flawed because if you click on ""Pre-Built Workout"" it brings you straight to an intense cardio workout. I am in shape, but everyone needs a warm-up. Hitting the ""Cadio"" option brings you to the same spot as the ""Pre-Built Workout."" I tried several times, to no avail. So I am sending back my DVD today. Do NOT waste your time and money on this!"
3,This video may not be for a beginner,"I guess I am the first to give this video anything but 5 stars. I am in my mid-forties. I haven't been working out for a few years and purchased about four videos to try to develop a healthy workout pattern. I've been going for three weeks and this video has not been my favorite. It may be that my fitness level doesn't allow for the intensity. I have really enjoyed theLeslie Sansone's Eat Smart, Walk Strong : The Secrets to Effortless Weight Lossand10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zonesmuch more than this video. If you are beginner, you might want to try one of the other videos first."
3,Poor Production Quality,"I bought this DVD from another website. Although the premise of the workouts are good (ten minute workouts) and the workouts themselves are good, I can only give it 3 stars because of the poor production quality. The images are jumpy on my TV screen and the exercises don't always follow the beat of the music. The poor production of this DVD really detracts from the workouts. I'll look for other workouts with Amy Dixon in the future that aren't produced by Women's Health. You'll need an exercise ball for the bonus workout, which was really great for abs."
5,time wise,"I like this DVD because you can concentrate on one area, or do them all. You also don't need alot of time, or items to work out with. Great workout."
1,motorola battery,This was advertized as a new battery but it would not hold a charge at all. I contacted the seller who promised to send a new one; I had to remind them twice before they sent it. Terrible seller- I'llnot buy from them again.
1,Battery was DOA,This battery did not hold a charge and was dead on arrival. I need to return it for an exchange. Hopefully the new one will work.
4,OK,"for the price it's great, but have not used it the phone is in another Country, will know more by the 1/25/13"
2,Motorola OEM BR50 Battery,"Purchased battery for Razr cell phone. Charged it fully, and it failed to hold charge for more than a few hours. Good price, but lousy product.Seller shipped another battery pronto at no charge, which I appreciate. The second battery, date stamped 10/17/2008 in new wrapper will hold a charge for only about 12 hours. Don't like to bother seller again, but somehow need a better battery."
5,Great Tunes!,"This is a collection of the early songs of the Clumsy Lovers, a bluegrass/celtic/rock band from Canada that I first encountered in the NW (but have had the pleasure of seeing in Arizona as well). The energy of the musicians comes through on each song on this CD. They play fast but with great skill. This CD contains both cover songs and originals and is a MUST BUY for fans of not only the genre, but for all music lovers who appreciate good musicianship. ""Chim Chim Cheree,"" ""Shakespeare Song,"" and ""Urban Decay"" are among some of the best gems on this collection."
2,Nasal...,"The instrumentation on this CD is wonderful, but I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on Al-Jundi's voice. It can best be described as ""nasal & droning"". I thought that perhaps this is the way traditional Syrian songs are sung and tried to appreciate it for it's authenticity, but alas, the droning quality of the singer's voice doesn't change from song to song and it gets old quickly. Hossam Ramzy arranged the traditional songs and produced the CD. This lends credence and support to Zein Al-Jundi's effort, but the CD just does not have enough variety or vocal sophistication to keep one's interest."
1,Unfortunate mutilation of great traditional songs,The musical background is well done but the singer's voice does not do justice to the great traditional songs from the Syrian musical heritage. I wish there were a way to filter out the singer's voice and enjoy the music. I will give away my CD if someone is willing to pay for the shipping.
2,Very low quality for the price,"I had been wanting a House of Staunton chess set for years. I finally paid out the money and bought this set. When it arrived I was shocked to find that the base of the king did not contain a felt pad (or a leather one as advertised) - it was just a plug of lead with a rough surface. I couldn't even place it on my chess board for worry that I would scratch the board. In addition, one of the queens had a funky white discoloration on the base. I contacted House of Staunton and was made to feel guilty by their customer service. I had to send in pictures and make numerous phone calls before I could get them to agree to send replacement pieces...not the level of customer service that you would expect from a company that charges as much as they do for their products. I do not recommend purchasing this set or any other from this company."
5,A handy guide to what makes software projects succeed,"Andrew Stellman and Jennifer Greene's Applied Software Project Management provides software engineers with a handy guide to what makes software projects succeed. From building a schedule and creating requirements and cases to managing an outsourced project, reviewing design and requirements, conducting interviews, and testing, Applied Software Project Management is broad enough to apply to all kinds of projects, yet specific enough to provide solid solutions."
2,wishy washy,This book is an interesting read. Its interesting to read about the author's interpretation of skiing movements. But there is very little practical help within. Basically each chapter goes on for a while discussing some point of skiing and then has a couple drills.How do I know if I'm doing the drills correctly?How does all this information work together?Basically there is very little structure to this book and does not present a clear framework for improvement.
5,Best Alpine Skiing Technique Book I've Found,"I have many alpine skiing technique books, and this is my favorite. It doesn't attempt to sell you a ""skiing secret"" or some gimmick. It describes what is happening with physics-relevant explanations that cover basic body positioning through coping with difficult conditions. Yet, it is not boring and overly technical. The language uses everyday terminology. Illustrations are plentiful and succinct. The author has done a fine job studying the sensations faced while skiing, and how to appropriately react for myriad conditions.Also includes gear-fitting and some selection advice."
5,Beyond the Basics,"Far better than most ski books. Covers aspects of back-side, all mountain skiing not covered in other ski instruction books."
1,Worst Piece Of Crap Ever!,This is the worst wrestling & commentary that I have ever seen and heard. I feel like a total sucker for even buying this junk. If you are a wrestling fan looking for some hardcore ultraviolent stuff this is not the place to find it! They use the old ECW names to try to hype this crap but every ECW member thats in this is wayyyyyyyyy past their prime. I wish i could put into words how awful this DVD is. Good thing the promoter (Black) had porn money to make this crap cuz he couldnt earn a dime doing this legit. There are more busted moves and crappy entertainment in this double volume then anything I have ever purchased in my entire life. If you loved the original ECW plz do not waste ur time on this junk!
4,"Interesting Concept, Bitter Buffy","Prophecies is a good novel with an interesting story. Buffy is facing a new foe, in the form of a demon-god. His vampire followers aren't like other vampires that Buffy has faced before, which causes her to be concerned. Buffy is also warned of some impending doom by a Prophet, but she is unable to figure out what will come to pass until it is too late.In this novel, Buffy doesn't quite seem like the Buffy from the tv series. She's cold and bitter. She's rude to her friends and is just mean compared to the tv version of her character. Though I don't particularly enjoy her attitude, she has her reasons for being this way and I respect that.The story takes a while to develop, which, though leaving you in suspense, is a bit off-putting. It is an interesting concept, though, so for that I give the book 4 stars."
3,Holding Out For More,"Part One of ""The Lost Slayer"" starts out strong enough. For the first time, one of Buffy's dreams results in someone getting hurt, physically. Willow and Buffy have a strong bond, but bonds are strained once someone gets punched in the face. In this first installment, Buffy admires Willow magical abilities and starts to look upon her as a warrior as well. It breaks my heart a little to read about Oz and Willow's relationship, because they do not last. Xander is charming and Anya is annoying. The novel was a tad slow, but I believe in the talents of Christopher Golden."
3,Super Reader,"Having the usual problems juggling uni and slayage, Buffy comes across some odd vampires on patrol. Tattoos of bats on their faces, they seem to drain energy, work together, and run away.With some research help they discover the existence of a bat god named Camazotz, who uses these special vampires, called Kazchiquels, as servants.Trying to discover what is happening, Willow summons Lucy Hanover, the ghost of a slayer, who brings with her The Prophet - when she possesses Buffy, she is sucked into what seems to be the futre, is several years older, and is in prison.A girl is thrown into a cell with her, and tells her Faith has just been captured, as well, so with no Slayers free, the new girl, August, needs to kill Buffy to activate a new Slayer to stop Camazotz's rule spreading."
5,The first part in a thrilling new story arc.,"Buffy is now a freshman in college, and is trying to balance friends and studies with her duties as a Slayer. But she's not doing a very good job of it. She has been fighting with Willow and is always late for her classes. In her sleep, Buffy has a vision of the long-dead Slayer Lucy Hanover warning her of a coming evil. But this vague prophecy is unable to do much but worry Buffy even more. An encounter with a group of vampires with weird bat tattoos on their faces and enhanced abilities has her even more on edge. After Giles is captured by the new vampire gang and their leader, an ancient demon, Buffy learns that along the way she has made a mistake that will lead to a horrifying future for all of Sunnydale. The first part in a new four-part Buffy story, this book was a thrilling page-turner that I reccomend to all Buffy fans."
3,You will learn a lot about the author..,"I just recently read ""The Digital Photography Book"" by Scott Kelby and picked up this book by Sammon based on the recommendation from Kelby. However, I would not recommend this book even to the most basic beginner. Although the book does contain a few helpful hints you will have to sort through the authors stories all the locations he has been, where he is currently in the world while writing a particular segment, etc. If you are looking for a book with basic information and lots of pictures with captions of where it was taken and what equipment (not basic by any means) he used to compose the shot this book is for you."
2,Promotion vs photography,"I was surprised when the book was unwrapped that it was outdated and talked about using Elements 2. Throughout the CD's he kept reiterating as he did a procedure that if he was doing it for a client he would be more precise. His readers aren't worth precise? This was all done off the cuff with no outline or plan. He evidently feels he's good enough to be able to just ""wing it."" Really Mr. Sammon you aren't. Teaching and writing are arts that require planning, precision, and commitment. Three items I found lacking in this."
2,Not that good,"I have to agree with the negative reviews of this book. I've read through the ""Captive Animals"" lesson, and I don't want to read any more: the lessons aren't particularly helpful. The lack of shooting info for the sample pictures is disappointing. The Photoshop tips seem pointless unless you already know a LOT about Photoshop: even then, Photoshopers probably wouldn't get much out of them. The advice mentioned in other reviews (wear a hat, protect your camera from the elements) seems silly in a book like this.This book as well as others by the author are shrink wrapped in the bookstore: apparently it's to prevent potential buyers from previewing it and deciding to look elsewhere."
3,"Aside from Beyonce&R.Kelly, slightly better than ok","I ain't never been that Big on Jay Z&while He has personna&has a few decent cuts there is way too much excess on this DvD that bog it down. Beyonce has that ""IT"" that makes you take notice&she does Her thing.R.Kelly The Music King steals the show of course&it can be argued that He has played a huge Role in Jay Z's Career over the past 5 years easily. but anyway some of this Show should have stayed on the Cutting room floor."
1,Terrible,I strongly disliked this dvd. Even with all the other talent on the disc it was terrible. Don't waste your money.
5,New found respect,"I have never been a big fan of Jay-Z, not enough to actually purchase an album. I've learned lyrics to the radio cuts and I respect him for being very witty and nice with the beats. Well, this movie is awesome. So many star-studded cameos, the behind the scenes footage of his actual songwriting in his head,a story of an intelligent man who came from the bottom to the top via hip-hop. This guy doesn't write anything down and he flows like leaky water faucets. I stayed glued to the TV and the concert seemed well worth my sleep time trying to finish it off in a couple of hours. I wanted to buy every CD he ever made here on Amazon afterwards. I am a new true Jay-Z fan now.p.s. I saw a friend in the audience a few times, she was rockin hard. Wish I lived in the NY. Young old, everybody got down at once."
2,Wonderful Christian and Bluegrass in one,"These are some fantastic singers on this album. I love gospel and I love bluegrass, so I can't ask for more. The voices are so pure and harmonious, and the musicians just as great. It makes me beg for more good old time music."
5,Very nice organizer,"This is a very nice organizer. Very sturdy and well made pieces. It was really easy to put together, no tools needed. The bins were a little smaller than I thought and only hold small toys, but with so many bins it holds a lot. Would buy again."
4,sunnymom,"I LOVE these bins. THey are a perfect size for my 2 yo. He can reach all the bins and they frame is really sturdy. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because when it arrived the plastic around one of the poles was damaged. I put it together anyway, and it seemed fine, so I left it. Overall, am very pleased with the quality and look of these."
5,Sturdy Toy Organizer with Bins,"This toy storage organizer with bins came quickly, was easy to put together and is very sturdy. My grandson learned how to remove the bin he wants easily and understands to put his toys away when he is done with them. The organizer is brightly colored and the bins being slanted makes it easy to see which one has the toys he's after! The bins are small but if they were too big they'd be heavy so these are just fine!"
5,nice outfit,"Love the skirt! Very simple outfit for a wench or a gypsy, too bad it doesn't come vith the head band."
5,Big fan of this book...!,I am glad Marvel is publishing paperback versions of their Masterpiece collections... this book is great and does present the best of the Sub-Mariner storys. I love watching the progression of Gene Colons work (under several different inkers) and the Jack Kirby drawn tales. Love the paper and coloring as well... thank you Marvel.
3,A decent read...,"As much as I admire Stan Lee's work on the early X-men and Daredevil comics, I have to say I don't think he was a good fit for Sub-Mariner. Lee's strong points were always his wonderfully quirky witticisms, which are conspicuously absent in Namor's constantly serious mood.That said, the single issue where Namor meets Daredevil is pure genius. In addition, though in the back of my mind my old Latin professor is shaking his head, after a few issues you find that Stan's nearly random exclamations of ""Imperius Rex!"" start to grow on you.All in all, a decent, if not impressive, read for Silver Age comic fans."
2,"Joining the chorus of ""Boooo!!!""","I'm puzzled as to how this product made it past QA testing. It's unbelievable that the product testing group forced this ""jacket"" on a Creative Zen, played with it and thought ""Hey! It's good to go!""This thing should be renamed the ""DLO Strait Jacket"". As others have mentioned, this case is a half size too small. In order to make it tolerable and allow my Zen to function, I had to: 1) cut the material at the top of the case where the power button is, so that it had some free play to stretch front-to-back; and 2) work the center of the case by inserting my hand to stretch out the width and depth so that the case could slide onto the Zen without constantly pressing the buttons.It's one thing for users to modify a product to make it better; it's another when users have to modify it to make it functional. If the price on this product dropped below $10, I'd say yeah, ok. But as-is, you should avoid it."
1,I would rate zero stars if possible,"As has been said the jacket it so tight that mine actually constantly caused the bottom two control buttons to be depressed rendering the Zen unusable.Power button is totally in accessible. Returned to Best Buy, cashier indicated this wasn't the first return he had seen for the same problem."
2,I cut a hole in mine,Everyone is right. This thing is extremely poorly designed. That said I bought this at Best Buy and am stuck with it. The problems that I had with this thing were the beginnings of scratches on my screen and having no cutout for the power button. So I bought myself a screen protector and cut a hole in the top of this jacket. Not particularly attractive but I made the best out of a bad situation. The armband is terrible (it doesn't fit!) but the belt clip is nice. I'll use it around the house but might use something prettier for venturing outdoors!
1,would have none if it was offered.....,ditto for everything that's written below. i purchased this item and returned it today. best thing about the item is the packaging it comes in allows you to return it without a restocking fee as it just snaps open and close. very disappointed.again the cons:1. fits so snug that it keeps buttons pushed down not allowing you to do much of anything.2. there's not a cut out for the power button on top making it almost impossible to turn off.3. it's pretty expensive at 25-35 to have all these pitfalls.
1,NOT for 60 GB and bairly for 30 GB,"ok for starters i have a friend that purchased one of these nice skins for their 30GB Zen. They said it worked fine once it got streach out. The same can not be said for the 60GB version of the Zen. If anyone manufactor in their right mind could please stop smoking crack for a second and please post, note, whatever, to make a mark that if it fits a 30GB or a 60GB. i have searched many websites with no success.In short not for the 60GB buttons are mashed down no matter how you streach it. broke mine trying >< can't use it to weight lift like i wanted now."
4,value and price,"does what its design to do .fair price .quality , dependable .Panasonic good products ."
4,Solid budget player!,"I am an avid movie watcher. You probably are too if you are reading reviews on DVD players. I bought this unit a little over a week ago and so far have had no complaints. Everything I have thrown at it has played with no problem. This includes burned DVD's and the like. The player itself has a nice sleek like, with blue text and red icons on the display for what type of mode or type of disc you are viewing. As mentioned in other reviews, the remote can have a bit of a learning curve, with its myriad of buttons and modes. However, by using the manual and some experimentation, I found the added features of the player to be very useful. Obviously, I haven't had it long, but I am looking forward to many hours of use.I highly recommend this player to anyone who is looking to spend under 100 dollars and get a solid player. I only give it 4 stars because I haven't had it for very long."
4,Great for the Price,Plays commercial DVDs and homemade DVDs just fine. I recorded some homemade DVDs on a Sony DCR-DVD203 and the Panasonic plays them all just fine. This Panasonic DVD player is about two months old (Christmas Gift).
5,Great Unit!,"Now I've only had the unit for a couple weeks, but this piece performs. Never bought a Panasonic anything before so I was a little weary. Great price though and it works like a charm. Good picture, good sound. Starts up very fast and doesn't skip a beat. I've watched a number of old and new dvds (our own and netflix) and it's read every disk like a champ."
1,Major Hidden Shortcoming!,"I purchased this Panasonic player to play DVD's I recorded at home with my Samsung recorder. The fact that the Panasonic played DVD-RAM was appealing, as was the price and the wonderful reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. Little did I know that the Panasonic cannot play homemade DVD's that are recorded on another brand's recorder. My 2-year old Zenith had no trouble playing my homemade DVD's, but the Panasonic froze up.After reading the manual, testing the unit, and looking on Panasonic's website, I finally called the service line. They informed me DVD's recorded on anything but Panasonic recorders would not play properly.If you have no intention of playing homemade DVD's, this may still be a good player for you. I personally think this is an absurd limitation, and it should have been listed in their product specs and manual (which I read before purchasing). I guess ""standardization"" is not a priority with Panasonic!"
5,Great Service,The item was just what i wanted and i got it right on time.To me i would say the service was magnificent and i would tell anyone how well the product works.It show any type of DVD the picture is perfect the sound is wonderful what more can i say i am please with it no complaints at all.
5,Our favorite comedy series!,"My husband and I love the series and have purchased each one as they have been available. We often watch King of Queens episodes instead of regular television programming. Doug, Carrie, and Arthur are our favorites! We will buy every episode and continue laughing it up as we watch King of Queens!!"
5,Excellent,This show gets better and better with each series. I absolutely love it. Just don't watch it late at night 'cause you'll wake the neighbours.
3,Sweet-Natured but Thin & Outdated,"This book has a big heart. I found the person of the author & what he had to say engaging. But as a practical manual, it is altogether lacking. The first problem is that it is very outdated. However, even for its time, it would have been rather thin soup for hungry bellies. Much better as a practical manual for hopping freights is Duffy Littlejohn's *Hopping Freight Trains in America* (ISBN 094462734X ), which I highly recommend.This book has true insiprational value, but little beyond that."
3,Nice for historic perspective,"This is pretty thin on actual advice, technique, and information about ""North America"", but it is a quick and entertaining read.Better info on the internet. Still, a wonderful book with great photos..."
4,Pizza Grill,"I really like being able to make pizza on the grill. It gives it that extra something. The stone is not the easiest to clean still, because it hasn't been used enough to season it thoroughly. Once seasoned I'm sure it will be great. Word of warning to anyone who has never owned or used a stone for cooking...DO NOT try to clean it when it's hot!!! It WILL crack. Wait until it is cold and then just use hot water. NO CLEANER OR SOAP, just water.This was a Christmas present and will be used often. Recommend to anyone looking for that extra something that grill gives."
5,Fun & Easy,"I bought this product for Father's Day this year as we like to make our own pizzas or cook frozen almost every Friday night. My husband also likes to use the grill whether it's summer or winter. What a perfect gift! He loved it and the kids enjoyed making the pizzas to put on the Pizzagrill. It fit perfectly, heated perfectly and they cooked perfectly and had such a great taste. We made 6 different pizzas in one night.......yum!"
4,Great find!,"I have a girlfriend who invited us over for dinner and served pizza from her own pizza stone. The pizza was divine! With small children and two working parents, we eat pizza once a week. After ordering my own, we have experimented with pizza 3 times in the last week and a half. The crusts come out nice, brown, crispy. Really happy that I ordered the stone and highly recommend it to others. The stone also works in the oven so don't just think BBQ grill.NEW ADDITION (Jan 5 09). Ok, so months on we are still using and loving the stone. With winter setting in, we have been using it in our oven. Crank the oven up to 500F and let the stone warm up while rolling out the dough and prepping. It is our Friday night ritual. Don't know when the last time was that I ate pizza delivery!"
1,Invisible PizzaGrill Saga...,"Ordered this grill on May 14, 2009 from Amazon at the bargain price of $79.99. It's now May 28, 2009 and still no delivery. Mysteriously, the UPS tracking number provided shows no activity other than billing information and Amazon customer service states a refund or replacement can't be processed until the magic date of June 1st. Now, seeing the $20.00 price increase for this item, one might begin to suspect Amazon's engaging in some shipping *monkey business* to avoid completing the transaction at the original $79.99 price.It appears Williams & Sonoma will now be getting my business on this item."
3,Disappointed,"This pizza grill takes a very long time to heat to the proper degree. It does not clean up since you cannot put wqter it. Also, it is very heavy to be llfting in and out of the oven."
1,Too Flimsy,"The product picture makes this look like a hard binder, but in fact this is made out of VERY flimsy plastic. Think of the thickness of a couple playing cards. For this reason, the binder would not be good for managing files, but instead of a small presentation. But if you made a presentation with a low quality binder like this, you probably wouldn't look too professional. If you are looking for a cheap binder, you're getting what you pay for on this one."
5,NFL History,"Wow. If you like football and want to learn a lot, get this DVD. It is long and will provide you with a great education on the early days of the NFL. Most of the players and coaches I either saw or knew of; some I had never heard of. The old films were neat and added a lot. This is a must for true diehard NFL fans. Watch this with your Dad and Granddad; they'll probably have some stories to add in."
2,Not in HD,"It was produced in 2006, this should have been in HD. It's probably worth $5 I paid, but I should have read more closely that it's just in 4:3 aspect. It's like watching the NFL on an old recorded VHS."
4,Good Customer Service,"I orderedhis set of Ramayana DVDs. Box and packing was good but there were few DVDs with scratch on them. Contacted Seller and they promptly responded and sent me replacement for the defected DVDs. I am very happy with the customer service they provided. On the DVD picture quality side, I think there is a lot of scope of improvement. May be watching all high definition movies and Blue Ray has spolied me.Overall this set is worth the amount I spent on this and I will definitely recommend the product"
1,EDITED FOR DVD!!!!!,"Again, just like in the S1 box set the episodes are EDITED!!!. This is most true during Hitch's introductions to the episodes. Some of the episodes (like in S1) are not edited (the ones with the black title letters) but most of them are.It's a shame that we cannot get the complete episodes. Someone ought to shoot the Universal archivist for this travesty.PS at least the manufacturing defect that plagued the first box set is now resolved (I hope)"
5,I can't wait,I have always loved this show. Great endings and great stories and acting. There are several episodes I'll be seeing for the first time. Nick at Nite used to show these many years ago but I was taping other shows at the time. Now I can sit back and enjoy this 2nd season uncut.
3,Production Problems Hurt Discs,"This wonderful collection of programs is seriously marred by poor productionquality of the discs themselves. I had to return two sets due to one ortwo defective discs per box. I finally kept the third box, despite a baddisc. Is adequate production too much to ask of the manufacturer?"
3,"Nancy Kulp missing from ""Jonathan""","Just got done watching ""Jonathan."" I was surprised to the see Nancy Kulp listed in the credits, because she wasn't in the episode. (Neither was Walter Kingsford -- they played the nurse and doctor.) I thought the Hitchcock DVDs were supposed to be uncut, but I guess not! Booo."
1,They're Edited!,"The episodes are edited. The credits list cast members that are not seen in the episodes. This is the only reason I gave this such a low rating. In Universal's defense, they don't state anywhere that the episodes are full and uncut."
5,this is worth buying twice.,"This CD is simply great. Whether you are a bass player, a drummer, a guitar player, singer, a keyboardist, or just a fan of good music, i recommend buying it. You can listen to samples of songs from all of their albums at their site, Javiermendozaband.com"
4,Wow Christopher Durang is a great writer,Christopher Durang is a very good writer. His plays are amazing. They are very funny and all have norals to them. I got this book because my school is doing some of his scenes and short plays next year so I wanted to read his work and it was great. He will be a legend for ever.
5,Great Blues,"Cuttin' In, with its guitar-driven style and strong vocals combine to make it a must-have for anyone who loves the blues. Although ""Double Trouble"" is the reason I bought the CD, the other 13 tracks are hot, too."
5,nice tea!,Love this tea even if we aren't lucky enough to have Scottish water in which to brew it. A good morning wake up! I'll buy it again.
4,Pictures Tell the Story,"I loved the show and wish they still did it. Thankfully, they now are starting Making Over America. The book is good in that the pictures clearly illustrate the points they are trying to convey. The downside is that some of their advice from the UK does not translate well to the USA. Also, as with any fashion advice, some of the stuff you see is going to be a bit dated by the time the book hits the shelves. Overall, it is a worthwhile book that I enjoyed. I do agree with another reviewer in that it did have a couple of ""befores ""that I thought looked better than the ""afters"". But in general, the book gives you a great sense of exactly what the title says, how to dress for certain occasions."
3,It's not terrible.,"The folding/travel feature is theoretically nice, but the seat is SO STINKING HEAVY that it's really no easier to carry than our (lighter) Britax we have in the other car. Chest clip and straps are exceptionally easy to use and not at all prone to tangling. Quite easy to install. And we didn't have the problem the PP mentioned, never had to call customer service fortunately. So it seems like a perfectly OK car seat, but the main reason we bought it was travel and it really doesn't have a particular advantage in that regard. We'll probably buy a ""CARES"" system and check our other carseat in the belly of the plane!"
5,Very Cute!,My 2-year old daughter loves having pretend tea parties - this is a great addition to her tea set for imaginative play!
1,completely disappointed,"I have purchased and used other Avery brand binders and have always been pleased with the usage. Unfortunately I can't say the same about this one. I had to return the first one as the rings were defective and gapped. The 2nd one I received had maybe 2 weeks use and the front cover started coming apart at the seam - currently its torn an inch up the seam. I don't even use it every day - at most 3 times per week, and it's never been dropped. Definately returning this one and requesting a refund this time."
2,Good design but bad quality,"The design is good but I think Avery has bad quality control. When we received it, it seems that it was black marks on the white surface and made me feel that it had been used. I still think it is new though. You could see holes at the seam of the edges and the seam would fall off pretty soon. I actually returned this item. However, the one touch EZD Ring is very nice."
3,Not really pink,"This pink is a very blue-ish pink to where it looks more like lavendar. I thought I was shipped the wrong product, but see that other reviewers say the same thing. If you are trying to coordinate it with other pinks - well it might coordinate since lavendar goes with pink, but it's really not pink. I have pink in the bedroom from multiple other companies - Carters, pottery barn, gap, restoration hardware baby ... and they're all a similar pink, with a soft almost peachy feel to it (but not peach).This is definitely a blue/cool pink. It stands out as a different pink than all the other baby pink things in the room. It really is more of a lavender.Beyond that, it's a lovely skirt. You can just throw it on under the mattress and it looks nice and airy, even if you don't lay it right."
4,Perfect! Just a bit too long.,"Goes great with our crib set-up. It is kind of long though. I wish it was a couple inches shorter. When we lowered the crib, after our daughter started pulling herself up, we had to take it off. I loved the way it looked while we had it on though!!"
2,Not luscious,Disappointed. I thought it would be fuller but its flat without any fullness. I was expecting something like pottery barn but I was way off and I am not tough to please.
5,Pretty,"Very pretty on my crib. A little longer than a lot of crib bed skirts, so that is nice while I have the bottom of the crib put on the high rung for my newborn."
4,Very pretty must be laid just right.,"This is very pretty with just the perfect amount of ""girlyness"". It does need to be laid just right and is very light and airy.I have a rod iron crib and it does not fully cover the corners, but this may be more due to my crib type than the skirt. However, I do LOVE the look and it is just right if you want something feminine and not an overstated crib skirt."
4,Great product,"It's lovely for a little girl's bedding. It's a bit long if you have the mattress support on the lowest setting, otherwise, it's perfect."
2,Not as Expected,"I purchased this for my daughter's nursery and was hoping it would complement the vintage rose pink I had already in the room (I was looking for a soft light pink skirt); unfortunately the color has more of a purple hue to it similar to a soft ballerina pink. It also is more princessy/fairytail looking then I thought it would be, an aesthetic I was trying to avoid. If you want to compare the color of the tulle, the light pink bridal tulle at Joanne's Fabric Store is the exact same color (I had some tulle rounds leftover from the baby shower). The third layer of fabric behind the 2 tiered layers of tulle is also a matching light pink cotton/muslin. I tried to see if the color of the crib skirt would change having a white or cream piece of fabric behind the tulle, but both colors made little difference, just a smidgen lighter, but the purple is still there. If you are going for a princess/fairytale or ballerina theme I think this pink crib skirt would complement perfectly."
2,Skirt is only on 3 sides!,"VERY disappointed with this product. The ruffle goes down both long sides of the mattress, and across only one end! While that makes sense with a normal bed, in my experience most cribs do not go like that. Our crib goes against the wall and one of the ends is exposed while the side against the wall is covered. It just doesn't make sense! The ruffle is OK- I can still see through the tulle to the metal support structure though, which was the whole point of getting the crib skirt. Pretty sure I'll be returning this. I don't recommend it at all."
4,Pretty Crib Skirt,"This item is absolutely adorable! Looks just right with the rest of her crib bedding. It does have a light lavender tint to it, but luckily that goes with the rest of the pinks in my bedding set! Over all very satisfied! Very cute!!!"
1,It is not even a cloth.,"The product description is deceptive. There was not enough pictures or description to understand what the product was actually made of. I would have surely returned it, but didn't wanted to go through the hassle. This material is a net like material and not cloth. I would not recommended this product."
4,Great!,"Biffy Clyro absolutley know what they are doing when they write music. Interesting album, I've listened to it 5 times in a row when I got it and still not sick of it. Highly recomanded!"
3,Last Two Tracks,"This album is pretty much correct on track listing but the final track is really track 17. Don't Stop The Rock - Freestyle (Freestyle Hall of Fame) , 18. Trinere - They're Playing Our Song, Hope this was helpfull to most."
2,Outdated but interesting,Baylis' treatment is very dated: his methods of scholarship are however a wonderful window into the approaches of so-called modernist historians. A favourite example is his reference on p.203 to Minucius' style reflecting on his age: Baylis deduces Minucius must have been writing before he had reached 50 years of age!The treatment of the dates of the treatise and scholarly arguments of teh 19th century- in particular Harnack- is useful.
4,paints a picture,Fred Eagelsmith is a unusual CD not a rough and rowdy material. Very subduced and understated. The only downer is the songs are all the same in style and arrangement. He should mix up the material.
4,Good basic DVD player,"This player works well overall and I was happy with the price. I like the instant replay feature to catch a missed line in a movie. The remote is a little awkward but functional. Only thing really frustrating is that I can not seem to find a way to display how much time is left in a movie, only how much has elapsed."
5,Disk Tray,"HI!! Bought this Panasonic and I have 2 Pan Recorders,5 Disk Changer.The S29 will go to my daughter so she can play the DVD-RAM. The tray is designed like that to accomadate the Type2 Cartridge I use to record in the RAM Formate. I can erase them and record new shows for her. That being said the S29S is like the other post on this site. Excelent for money,and its ease of operation."
4,"Very good, but...","After buying this DVD player, when I received the box, it was a huge package. It did not matter; besides, this DVD player is good at its main function: the video and audio quality are good, the remote control buttons are quite easy to find and press, amongst other characteristics such as playing from the last scene. However, I could find a dark spot: when I try to rewind or fast-forward, it is not so quick as I expected. It takes too long to rewind even 2 minutes; in contrast with a VCR, the VCR is faster. This is kind of non-sense... but well, at least Panasonic did not disappoint me with this product. It is good after all..."
5,So far so good... real good,"I got it because my other one kept pixelating and locking up on the backups and some of the originals. I did a little reserch and this seemed to be a good one for the burned discs. It has done fine, it's played perfectly through the bad parts of discs that wouldn't even play on the drive that burned them. It doesn't do DIVX or AVI though, but it doesn't claim to either. The one thing I don't care for is the menu. My other one was way more intuitive and remembered it's place well. This one is lousy for that. The zoom feature is pretty good though. It allows you to fit the screen in several different ways rather than just the hugh blow up that most do. This menu thing isn't a big hardship it's just not all it could be. But what can you expect for this price range? I'd do it again as of now. If it lasts it'll be a real bargain."
5,Ecellent DVD player,"The S29 is an excellent DVD player. Picture quality is great and it plays all commercial CDs & DVDs and all of the burned CD-R, DVD-R and DVD-RW discs that I tried. The best thing I like about this player is the zoom feature. It can zoom in on those really narrow letterboxed movies leaving smaller black bars or even full screen with no picture degradation that I can see. When zooming in it does lop off the left and right sides a bit but I've watched the same movie in normal (skinny) and European Vista mode (bigger picture will small black bars) and I found that I don't miss the left and right sides at all (I live in the USA, NTSC land). I would buy this player again even if it sold for more dollars."
5,I would totally want to have anyone read this book about the Catholic mass!,A marvelous book.. Please get it. The Mass is so important to prepare for ..... Romano Guidini has written the most thoughtful and reverent book!
2,disappointed,i'm disappointed with nikon's quality. the shutter button seemed to have gotten stuck after only a few months. because of this the camera wouldn't focus automatically and it triggered without my clicking on it.
1,nikon blows,"three hours after starting to download pictures to my computer i am still waiting for support from nikon. i was told to download a necessary patch, call back in two days, then kevin in tech support hung up on me. i am appalled at nikon's arrogance. they sell a thousand dollar camera without an a/c adapter, without functioning software, and without technical support. this camera is for the sadomasochist. buy kodak, olympus, anything but nikon, in my opinion."
5,"great tool, new ways of seeing!","This great system of imaging has revitalized my photojournalism, providing immediate feedback, color temprature balancing, low light photography, supurb detail with the fisheye and long telephoto, great closeup work. You simply must buy another harddisk with this camera. very controlable, you should spend time with the well written manual. Software upgrade of camera firmware downloaded over the internet from Nikon improved operations. Still a bit slow to record images, but a fabulous tool, extension of the eye. Camera has more ram than my computer! Using photoshop vastly improves the images, better environmentally than using the old chemical systems."
5,powerhouse,"I purchased the coolpix 990 because I was starting to get into photography. I was a beginner in every sense of the word. The 990 is packed full of features that can be overwelhming. It took me awhile to learn everything, but it was worth it. The only suggestion that I would make is to purchase an external flash. The one that is on the camera tends to promote red-eye. Other than that this is a winner."
5,Great BANG FOR THE BUCK!!,"I used this camera as part of my journalism class. The camera is an excellent value. The megapixels are enough for most applications, and the price is not large enough to break your pocket book. I am thinking about picking one up this year. For [the price], this camera is a steal. The only thing that I wish this had which only the top end SLR cameras have, are interchangable lenses. But for the average shooter, this is a great camera."
4,That battery door problem...,"Just wanted to add my 2 cents worth. The image quality, ease of use and features on this camera are very, very good but not worth the original price of nearly $900. However when our company's needs grew I did think it was wise to buy a used one for under $300. Shortly thereafter BOTH cameras experienced the same broken battery cover problem described elsewhere here. A little research revealed vendors who actually sell replacement doors (but alas no instructions on how to complete what seems like a fairly tricky repair). We still use the cameras with tape and cords when possible but buyer beware!"
4,"Great!!, But ...",It's a Great CameraBut it have two problems1-Don't work well with low light2-The driver fails with Windows 2000
1,"Impossible for muscular calves, chinsy","I'm not the most buff guy in the world and my calves are 19 inches around, but these things did not fit at all. They come in one size, which unfortunately for this long-time Busa rider, was way too small. Icon makes great stuff, but these knee pads aren't on that list.Measure your calves first, if they are bigger than 16 inches, you may have a problem fitting these."
1,Junk Junk Junk :(,"I kept this in my car for 6 months. I only go out about 1 time a week for a 6 mile drive... I used it once to power my laptop when I lost power in the house due to a storm. Seemed to keep a charge for about 2 months. AFter using it once to power laptop, and then to inflatea bike tire. Now it won't hold a charge, and still looks brand new. Spend a little more money and get something that will really work when you need it."
5,Pedal Pusher,I think this is a great product for sedentary people. I purchased it for my 96 year old mom so that she can improve her circulation.
3,And the winner is ....,"If we use the following:1. The incorporation of a stored program is critical to design and use of what we know as a ""computer""2. A working model has to be createdthen the winner in this race might be the Cambridge University EDSAC.I believe that the creators of EDSAC attended the critical summer school in the US and also had access to critical reports, but if I have may facts right they did have an operational computer running real programs about year before anyone else."
2,Apples and Oranges,"The ABC is technically the first computer because a judge said so.In a nutshell, the Atanasoff-Berry Computer was nowhere near powerful enough to even be mentioned in the same sentence as the ENIAC, which performed sophisticated calculations for the US military for years, before becoming the cornerstone of the UNISYS corporation.Maybe the people who developed the bicycle should be credited with inventing the automobile."
1,Lots of pictures... and that's it,"I bought the two guides and I don't see any improvement from one to the other.A lot of pictures, some trade prices but that' s it.I expected some explanations but for an ""unofficial guide"", there is not even a word about the previous transformers (diaclone, kronoform, etc) and/or all the fakes you can find.There is also no chronology and more over as a european transfan I didn't see something about the european special releases.In others words: it's every thing but a reference.You would find much more info by surfing on personnal web sites.I gonna keep the two books cause there are very nice pictures in them but it's very disappointing."
2,Only recommended for first time dog owners,"While this may be a great book for first time dog owners, it doen't give much detail on the French Bulldog breed itself. This book basically gives you the basics of what you need to know about raising a dog. I expected there to be a lot more information specific to French Bulldogs but unfortunaly that is lacking."
3,Decent Guide for French Bulldog Owners,"This is a reasonably good, short guide to owning a French Bulldog. It covers most of the key topics like training, nutrition, and health, in a short readable format. The only problem with the book is it's often more of a guide of where to get more information than a reference manual. I often find myself wishing it provided more detailed information than it does. Nevertheless, it's a good book to have if you own a Frenchie."
1,Not Worth Reading For Free if You Want a French Bulldog,"I purchased this book in anticipation of the arrival of my french bulldog. This book is the book you buy if you want to convince a friend or family member the last dog they want is a french bulldog. Take the question of how best to housebreak your puppy. Answer: It can't really be done, but ""frenchies are such clowns"" you won't mind. Every question the author raises is either not answered specifically or answered with a promise of a difficult dog with the continual refrain ""frenchies are such clowns."" If you want an intelligent and honest understanding of how to raise a french bulldog, buy An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet (a series with different breeds) French Bulldog by Kathy Dannel.The French Bulldog: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet"
1,Amateur,A fast read. This book contents are very poorly organized and story items repeated. Pictures could have enhanced the contents.
4,Pee smell out,"I had brought this at Petco when I ran out. Tried to buy again but, they discounted it. So had to go to amazon. This product work better then any one. I just don't understand why they discounted it. Works better then any other product and I have tryed them all will cats and dogs in my house the smell is gone try it use will like it."
2,wwe is better than tna,Listen all of you crack heads who thinks that the wwe sucks you are retarded. John cena is much of a better champ than who is that over on tna that has the belt it's christan cage and the only reason why he left the wwe is because he couldn't win the belt so why don't you all shut your mouths and watch some real wrestleing that is the WWE.
1,WWE sucks simple as.......,"WWE has crap champions like Cena,and at WM22-OMG! its HHH again!I really wanna didh out 30 dollars to see that.WWE is for kids,TNA is for teenagers-like me.We have enough soap opera`s on TV thanQ very much WWE,But WWE where is your soul wresting?!WWE used to be excellent(1997-2003) but WWE is just getting old now here in 2006.TNA is the alternative for anyone who is bored of the old Entertainment-Or if you love watching fights.byeHell yeah!my review was the best EVAAAA! agree?By ""KoolKatz1964"" aged 13"

2,Not happy with this album,"The music in this album does nothing for me. A bit too jazzy. I like his older songs when he was with Jack White.(written by Stevan's wife, Anne)"
1,Awful spaghetti Western,"What an awful movie. I had such high hopes with this one. I'm a huge fan of the Western, and the spaghetti Western is one of my favorites. Reading the synopsis, I couldn't wait to get into this one. It started out good, with Joseph Cotton and his family slaughtering the Union soldiers, then it just fizzled from there. To me, it borrowed too much from Django; like Sergio Corbucci couldn't think of anything else and decided to add another coffin. If you're looking for something like Hellbenders to watch for the first time, I highly recommend Django or Keoma. Other reviewers will tell you Keoma has a really bad score, but you get used to it and it's a really cool movie, as well."
4,Another One Bites The Dust,"A lot of the plot devices are a little too convenient and dialogue often comes off kind of and stagey and over-enunciated, but if you can see past that, The Hellbenders takes a few less than likable characters on some occasionally unexpected turns and may be enjoyable for its 1967 spaghetti western vibe. By the end of the movie I felt it had fairly captured something unique in Western poetic pathos. Thus a 4 instead of 3-star rating. I deliberated, beleive me.This movie is one step up from B western movie fare, but only a step - still, fans of the era might find it worthwhile.Set just after the civil war, a murderous ex-confederate general and his sons assault and steal a large sum of money from the cavalry in order to re-start the Southern war effort against the Yanks."
1,random thoughts of a 1970's grandmother,"I could hardly finish this book full of random, obvious, disconnected thoughts, writing lessons (even, believe it or not, a lesson on punctuation), boring events, and thinly veiled bragging. To make it worse, it's full of references to life in the 70's, which make it hopelessly dated."
1,can't believe i didn't like this,Wow. I have been a big fan since reading A Wrinkle in Time as a child. I cannot believe that I really cannot read this book. I am finding it boring and self-serving. She seems so self-satisfied. She talks about how important it is not be self conscious when you are trying to be. Yet this book sounds like she is completely self conscious writing it. She sounds like everything she tries to teach other people not to be.
5,Excellent service & timely delivery,"My son truly enjoyed his costume, and delivery was right on schedule. No problems at all. I also appreciated that my two orders were shipped in one box (I made two separate orders w/in minutes, and the company figured it out & saved on packaging. Thank you!)"
1,The rough draft for Jump Start Your Business Brain,"This basically seems like dougs earlier book (which was fantastic) ""jump start your business brain"", except written entirely in point form. Id expect more from a guy who considers himself a creativity guru.However the book does do a good job of condensing the most important aspects of basic marketing knowledge. The practical ideas are nice as well and give you something to think about. However this was nothing that was done in his last book."
3,not so great,"Basically this is a copy of ""Jump Start Your Business Brain"" In point form.More or less a good book. But i wouldnt reccomend reading his last book in conjunction with this one. It might seem a little to repetitive."
4,I liked it,"Very interesting to say the least. A great picture of the ""old world"" meeting the new. Felt like we were watching a lifestyle that may not exist in the future, which made me appreciate it being captured. Breastfeading scene caught me a little off guard, but understand that they were trying to show life in the tent. Would be interested in seeing a follow up, actually. Not sure how great of a guy one of the main characters was, and wonder why his wife would have stayed with him. Perhaps she felt like she had not other choice. The film did help me appreciate the comforts of home that I have, but leaves me wondering if I am better of without them? See for yourselves and make your own opinions."
4,Quality,If you can find another compilation of great artists with a DVD of music videos at this price.... oh wait you can't.
5,RIP oxford collapse,one of the best indie rock records of the 00's. too bad this band never got had the financial security that they deserved. critically acclaimed but shunned by listeners... do yourself a favor and buy this album. i got it for like $2.50. pure. catchy. indie. rock.
5,Life changing,"My doctor recently introduced salonpas to me for my arthritic knees. They start to work almost immediately. Without them I can barely walk. With them the pain goes away totally, or enough so that I can function. This product is amazing."
5,kwnewell@yahoo.com,simple the product is great and came fast.salonpas is about the only product wether a patch or the gel for me is the best.
1,Where are the 4 Bonus Features?,"Amazon advertised this item as a ""2pc"" set. They titled the item ""17 Kids and Counting (2pc)"" and they showed the picture of the dvd case sleeve that clearly stated that this item ""Includes 4 Bonus Features."" When I received this item, there was only one disc in the case, and there were NO bonus features on the disc at all. There were 10 regular episodes, but there were NO bonus features....even though the dvd case sleeve clearly stated on both sides that the item ""Includes 4 Bonus Features"" and even names the four titles of the bonus features on the back of the case. Very disappointing.17 Kids & Counting (2pc)"
4,"Love the show, misleading DVD","I've never missed an episode of the Duggar family, and when I found out that this dvd set was coming to Amazon, I jumped all over it. I had it preordered the minute I found out. When I received the dvd, I got excited to watch all the old specials, and so it was immediately popped into my dvd player. However, I realized after starting the dvd set, that the 4 bonus features were on another dvd. The explanation on both sides of the case said it has 4 bonus features, but that isn't the case. Can anyone fix this?!"
1,Don't get what you pay for.,Said it has the bonus episodes of the specials. The DVD I recieved did not. False advertising! I was not happy I believe you should get what you pay for.They are selling these DVDs under false pretenses.
3,Not bad.,"It's not bad, however I did find a 2200mAh battery for cheaper. I wished I had found the other battery before I bought this one."
5,Hart To Hart - Season 2,Hart To Hart - Season 2 disks are excellent! I truly enjoy view these episodes over and over again. Robert Wagner and Stephanie Powers always had a connection with each other and it showed in the series. I recommend Hart To Hart to everyone interested in mysteries.
5,Entertaining and Funny,"My husband and I watch this show each evening before bed. With not much on TV these days other than horendous violence and reality ""crap"", this is such a nice change. No swearing, no sex and the violence is such a step down. Our teenage children can't help but stop to watch this show with us, along with others from the 70's and they enjoy them all...Rockford Files, Hardcastle & McCormick, Family, St. Elsewhere etc. We love to see the all the favorite guest stars on these shows. Looking forward to the next 3 seasons of Hart to Hart. Hope they are out soon."
5,Great picture!,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a fan of the show. I watched a couple of episodes and the picture looks great. If you like Hart to Hart, I recommend the set."
1,Sony is the pits,"Great show, but as is the case with many Sony releases, they simply stop releasing DVD's after a few seasons if they think that the show isn't selling well enough. They are notorious for ending the release of a series after a season or two. Some real geniuses working there. I'm now stuck with partial runs of Fantasy Island, Hart To Hart, etc... If you like to collect full runs of classic TV shows like I do, it's almost better not to buy the first seasons from Sony in the first place. They're the the worst, and obviously couldn't care less about their customers."
4,Hart to Hart-season2,"I liked it very much,I just wished they would add more special features. The sound was great however. I rated it 4 stars, because there were no special features"
2,Poor book for Kindle,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK FOR KINDLE VERSION.You are unable to do any search with the kindle book. I called the kindle representative, Enrique who stated that not all kindle books allow you to search specific items. NOT TRUE- this is not what is stated in the kindle manual when you purchase this. He also said that the cheaper the book the less likely it would be able to search or to localize a word. Also not true- I bought a kindle book for $7- twenty times cheaper than this useless book and am able to search what I want with no problems.More than likely this book has not been properly processed for kindle. Extremely misleading for kindle users. I have returned this book with my money back.The morale of this story is whatever kindle you buy make sure it does what it is supposed to do!Note to amazon- You need to check the books processed for kindle before selling them.ThanksAn unhappy customer, Little Rock, AR"
1,Not as successful as his other books,"This was Laszlo's attempt to do what no one has done before him -- and, alas, he doesn't come anywhere near to pulling it off. The academic grounding that Laszlo tries here to create makes for too many contorted kinds of arguments. The author points to all the right issues, and he goes at them in ways that might, under another pen, have produced some startling breakthoughs in thought. But Laszlo is not the one to take this on. For those who still hjunger for a grand synthesis of all things -- human and cosmic - I suggest turning instead to someone like Ken Wilber, or -- if you have a few months of non-stop reading time -- to the colletced works of Alice A. Bailey.I do give him an ""A"" for effort, however."
4,Euphonius Ormandy,"This recording is essential for any fan of Ormandy and the Philadelphians. Rarely if ever did RCA or CBS record them so well. It's also one of the best Four Legends ever. Add to that Berglund's first-rate Tapiola and you can't lose. Unfortunately, this disc was a victim of EMI's now-you-see-it, now-you-don't print policies. Worth seeking out."
2,"small and weak, not worth the money","the product picture does not give an idea of the size, they are very small and weak magnets. don't hold much to the fridge. not worth the money and not worth returning."
5,Great tool,I am enrolled in a veterinary assistant class and this book has been a great tool for my classes. It has great photos to make the understanding of certain diseases more understandable. I recommend for anyone who is or want to be in the veterinary field.
2,Don't Get This One,"As a first year Vet student I can attest to how frustrating it is to have a dictionary that doesn't contain most of the ""new"" vocabulary that you're having problems with already.I don't really know which dictionary would be a good alternative but I highly recommend finding any other one than this one. I believe Stedman's is supposed to be really good. I don't think it is necessary to have a Veterinary Dictionary because a lot of the terms are equal in human and animal medicine."
1,Picture Show Problems,"At first, I liked the improvements made to this over the 2.0 version I had been using; however, when I tried to finally write an output to either a DVD blank disk or to an iso file, the program causes an error and drops out. This, after waiting over an hour for it to compile the slideshow!Thinking the program had bugs which were corrected in the next version (4.0), I bought Picture Show 4.0 which unfortunately had even more problems. Then I went online to the users support groups and found that both programs had these problems and that many Ulead customers were complaining of the same thing. The same thing was true of several other Ulead products such as movie factory.After contacting Ulead, I found they had no solution and did not even admit there were problems. Sobeit. Ulead has lost a customer for good.The better tool (one that works) is ArcSoft's DVD Slideshow, Version 1."
2,More for Kids,"This would apeal to younger group and not as professional grade as I wanted. I was disappointed in the context. Very limited on transitions and timeing. Compaired to ProShow Gold, I liked the moving pictures and the amount of music available. Other than that, ProShow has it beat. What I don't like in both the limit to music DLL's. I had as many freezes with it as with the other and don't understand why."
1,customer service stinks,Have a problem???? Don't waste your time calling...the number in the book is a non-working one...E-mail???? Forget it....you get an answer that does not relate to your question...All they want to do is sell product then let you hang....I have sent 4 E-mails and still no answer....Live and learn...
2,Slow product,Overall I found this product to perform as advertized but found it to be virtually useless because of its unbelieveable slow speed. Processing of a full photo dvd took over twelve (12) hours
2,Bizarre,"This episode was set up by production as far as the men's activities are concerned. At least it really seemed that way from an outsider's point of view. Why would three men, two of whom it is against their religion to be in a place serving alcohol, go to a biker bar? Maybe because it looked cool for shots and so production wanted to capture a real men's night out? The women all showed their fun side by hitting up the strip, what if the idea of fun for these men is sitting around talking about family? It seemed that could have been the case as the three older brothers appeared much more comfortable while doing the church service than they did going to any bar. That wouldn't make for good tv though."
1,Hated it!,"Storyline would be good ""IF"" the people were more appealing... in every sense of the word. This show sucks only because the women in it are NOT attractive at ALL."
1,Not the right one,"I already wrote and said this was not the right episode. It was the after the last show talk with I can't remember the host now it was a while a go. So I asked then If I could get my money back on that one . Sincerely , Deborah Bergen"
4,season 4,I started watching sister wives because I was bored. However they won me over and I couldn't stop watching until there were no more episodes. At least they know who their husband is sleeping with when he isn't with them. Unlike most traditional marriages where one of the spouses cheats. I love their large family and hope they can get the four houses.
2,Niche Film,"A subtitled Lebanese movie that may attract those with an interest in Middle East politics, customs and mores. A mix of serious drama, comedy and surreal interpretation that really doesn't seem to have much in the way of mainstream viewer appeal. More of a specialized niche film."
4,Pretty nice,"This boombox has very nice sound, You have to extend the antenna wire out away from radio to pick up go signal in most cases. even outside. if you like to sit outside and listen to xm this is the thing for you. Needs a plug near by though.............. because it takes 8 d batteries."
3,Neutral,"Did not fit vehicle, eventhough year and model of vehicle was provided during ordering. Item arrived in good condition, but unable to use for vehicle."
5,awesome service,"i already knew the product was gonna be great, but the service from this vendor was nothing short of phenomenal!"
2,"Great Looking, Looks Can Be Deceiving!","I have always expected a lot from the Altec Lansing name. When I found a set of computer speaker for $99.00, I thought WOW. Instead of researching this product, I purchased it from experience of their previous products. As the other reviewers have stated the user interface on this is very limited. Without the remote, you cannot even reset the system to it's original settings, place in standby, or control the bass and treble features. The main reason that I give this product a poor review is due to the lack of any mid-range sound. If you do not know what mid-range sound is, then I highly recommend spending $100 on this product, you will soon understand the purpose of mid-range! Altec Lansing definitely could have made this product better, considering that even Bose has a $100 A/V system that is inferior to this one."
4,Good for the price,"the good : Half the price of similar speakers at best buy. Sound quality is great. Sleek modern design adds to my room.the bad: Sometime I can tell when I'm about to get a text message or phone call before my phone does because I get a small amount of humming from the speakers. It is kind of hard to figure out what volume and acoustic setting you are at since there is no display of any kind or even a way of knowing you are at the max (like a blinking light)Overall, great value... would recommend it to anyone"
2,Return none working model,Received unit in good condition and fast delivery. Not much documentation with product. Cannot get remote control to work and will be returning the unit for refund. Remote control was one of the main reasons for buying this model.
3,"Good system, my two problems with it...","I'd buy this system again for the money--it's got plenty of power and a clear sound. But here's two problems I wish I'd known about before I bought them.1) wires to the two satellite speakers are short. I think they're 8 foot, maybe 10 at most? Fine, obviously, for putting next to your monitor, but I wanted to put them around the room, and I'm going to have to go to Radio Shack for extenders to do that.2) Mid-range on the speakers is disappointingly weak. I know, I know--to be expected in a 60 dollar computer speaker system, but I was still bummed. It helped music playback a little to tweak the equalizer on my iTunes."
4,worked best after a week,"When I first got rhese the sound was terrible, after about a week they started to sound good when I used the equalizer in Winamp and on Windows media player, without that they sounded pretty flat"
2,Remote good! Speakers bad!,"Decent price but you get what you pay for. The speakers have no mid range capabilty, and the bass response is poor. I bought this system with the intention of replacing a 2.1 logitech ($50 at Sam's Wholsale) on my main TV. I bought it for the remote capabilty...my current required me to go to the TV to lower/raise the volume.Dissappointed with sound, but like the remote. I'll probably replace with a higher end system at a later date...back to walking to TV for volume for now."
5,Just what I expected,This speaker system sounds fine. The price is reasonable for what you get. The set-up is as easy as one could expect.
2,Not bad but not as good as I thought it would be.,"I bought this speaker set for my son's computer to replace the oem units that came with it. I have a Klipsch thx setup on my computer, and I thought this set would be close, but not even. No midrange and very boomy unless you take the time to adjust it just right. Plus if you loose the small remote, it's pretty much a lost cause at that point. You could do better for the same money elsewhere."
5,Quality for a reasonable price,"These puppies have great bass. A bit weak on the mid-range, but the sound is crystal clear and the powerful bass more than compensates. In addition, the design is very attractive. The satalite speakers fit snuggly onto my desk, while the subwoofer has found a nice place among my shelf. Don't hesitate: Altec Lansing is better quality for a bit less money than the Bose name."
5,Better than any iPod dock out there !!!,"I made a very good decision in buying this over the M602 or the Bose sounddock for iPod. Agreed, it does work out a li'l inconvenient because you still have to control everything from your ipod to change playlists etc, but I'm willing to take that hit for the kind of sound output this gives.The woofers are mindblowing, and it can easily fill a huge room with heavy music and beats.If you dont mind the pain ( or rather if u stop being lazy) of charging your ipod seperately and not in your ipod dock, this is the system for you. The ipod docks are way more expensive and can never match the sound quality that a woofer gives you.Highly recommended,"
2,Dissapointed,"I think these are fine for electronic music with moderate tones but they are inadequate for rock n' roll. They tin out easily on rhythm guitar. They had some $100 Bose speakers in my office without sub woofer and frankly they sounded much better. I guess for $33, I should have been happy with what these are."
3,Nice System,"I bought this system to use with my tv instead of a surround system. It has nice high tones and the sub sounds ok. The mid range is lacking though. Some of the lower tones out of sub sound cheated. Some clipping too. The remote is nice but very small. I think someone else who did a review commented on the controls for the system only being on the remote. So if you lose it, you don't get to tweak your system to your liking and it is small and would be easy to lose. If your looking to get something that will blow you away, then this is not it. Check out some bose 2.1 systems."
3,"Great sound, bad controls","I've had these speakers for about two years. But the power control's broken shortly after a few weeks, so I have to use the remote control to turn it on and off. It still works ok until today. Poor quality material, But the sound quality Is good enough for the money."
4,Full on Oi,"Blitz never did really make it into the limelight. Their 3 chord gravel scream is pretty typical of the punk/Oi genre. There is nothing extra special about this album. However, if you like your music fast, simple and brutal, this is a must have. All the songs are good and speedy and there are several well known punk anthems such as 4Q and Razors in the Night. Well worth a listen and if you are serious about your punk/Oi, you should have it."
5,A great gift for birthdays and special occasions.,This is a truly heartwarming book with many wonderful stories from celebreties sharing memories of their mother from the past and present. If you need a great gift for your mother this book hits the spot.
5,A Great Book,"This book takes all the things you want to say about music and puts it into words. As it contains many short quotes along with chapters, it is a great book for anyone who loves music; even if they don't love reading."
5,Gripping Drama,"This book is a powerful and fascinating study of the legislative process that led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Democrats were in the majority in Congress, but the South, which had disenfranchised Black Americans was a solid voting bloc within the Democratic Party. As a result, the legislation was something of a battle for the soul of the party. Robert Mann uses Hubert Humphrey, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Russell as the focal points to examine the , liberal, moderate, and conservative wings of the party. Mann worked on Capitol Hill for two Senators and knows how it works. He is also a gifted wordsmith. He gives every man their moment and provides his readers with a riveting account. It was difficult to put down. I used this book when I taught a course on U.S. history in the 20th century and the reaction of my undergraduates was similar. If you liked television's ""The West Wing,"" you will love this book."
5,Highly underrated gem,This probabaly one of the most underrated and undervalued cd ever to be released.The music is first rate coming from highly talented musicians and must be heard to be believed....great sound quality.
1,Abomination,Bill Hebden is the class clown of audio engineers. He is totally oblivious to any criticism. Best to steer clear of his work and any of the lables that he has made up. He completely destroys the sound of the music with his digital gimmicks. You can hear him constantly turning the dials as the music is playing so all kinds of extra noises pop up through the record. It's a real shame because he has some great records and then ruins them with his gimmicks.
5,Original Dance Music of 1920's & 1930's,Bought as a gift. A couple of pieces I listened to were intertaining.
2,Not What I Would Wear,"The photo makes the face look like it has a lot of red but I couldn't see any red tone at all when I actually received it. The stones running outside the bezel are set in gold which really looked cheap to me. The mesh band was the one positive point of the watch, but it's definitely not a watch I want to be seen wearing. Returned."
3,Nice Looking Watch.... Not Made For Small Wrist,"I bought this watch thinking this was going to be beautiful in person... and it was.. the red is a gorgeous mother of pearl burgandy... but the notches it has to adjust suck.. to be frank... This watch is not made for a 5.5-6 inch wrist. I put it on the smallest setting you can set it on.. now i dont mind a little breathing room. But the watch slide around like a bracelet, and i had to keep moving it. If i had my hand down by my side it slid to the bending point of my hand and wrist. I just can't see having to keep fixing the watch everytime it moves. So i have to send it back, ( this is my 2nd Skagen i sent back, w/the mesh band. So its safe to say, i will not be able to purchase mesh bands, untill they add an extra notch to adjust for a little bit smaller of a wrist )"
4,good,"Advertised as ""durable"" and I think that's accurate, although I haven't had it long enough to give a better review. Seems like a great quality binder. I like the non-catching ring joints."
3,I expected better music,It wasn't what I had hoped for. I was expecting to have a few more jazzy songs but these all sounded the same
5,Early years were unknown to me,The book was very good. I didn't have time to finish it however. I never knew he was a telegraph operator.
4,Historical or hysterical lawyers,"This story tells of the lengths that these 2 lawyers would go, to get their clients to win a case. Very interesting reading."
5,Great book of Faerie Tradtion,This is one of best books on fay tradtion i would check the rest of his books.I found that it has alot of useful infomationand the book is not very bias which is nice to see in a book. Worth every penny.
5,Living every football fan's dream,"A book every true football fan should read. Author Jeff Foley is allowed to spend the preseason as a member of the Albany Firebirds of the Arena Football League, not as a reporter hiding in the shadows but as a true professional football player. That's the rule, he is to be treated just as any other player on the team. As a rookie he receives his share of hazing but also earns the respect and support of his team mates because Jeff proves his courage, heart and his unwillingness to quit. From pregame preparation talks to post game meetings, Jeff Foley shows that there really is a special man behind each and every face mask. The reader learns that even though the players come from different backgrounds and may even be compeating for the same roster spot, a team is a unique type of family. Locker room antics, childhood memories, daily practice sessions and the games are interlaced into a ""can't put it down"" story."
3,"Great sound, Very brittle","These speakers sounded great,hits such great highs and all without distortion! but a year after I purchased them the tweeter portion started to be wobbly and after time broke off of the speaker. I was very disappointed with this. I did purchase a new pair of the 63.9i and checked the tweeter portion prior to installation and it seems much more sturdy, we will see."
3,An Artefact of Ancient Comparative Religion,"Celsus' On the True Doctrine is one of the few surviving anti-Christian tracts to have escaped the pyre [see also, *Julian's Against the Galileans and *Porphyry's Against the Christians]. This is owing to Origen, who preserved this discourse in its entirety while offering his sagacious and long-drawn rebuttal in his polemic the Contra Celsum. The tract is unique as an artefact of ancient comparative religion, and it will be useful for anyone who wishes to gain a greater perspective on the Hellenistic-Christian debate. And with the outstanding introductory essay and the extensive footnotes this volume will greatly accommodate readers in the classroom and at home."
4,"Great CD, all the way around","The players on this CD are all top notch. Check out the drums on ""Snakes."" Peter Erskine is the best around. After 10 years, I'm still not tired of listening to this, and I'm buying another copy to help introduce my nephew to great jazz."
2,Too much going on,"There are just too many plot threads going on in this book. The stuff about the protagonist's father (an ambassador who has been perhaps kidnapped abroad) and his new young wife was jarring and unnecessary. Ditto the plot line about the escaped convict that has nothing to do with anything and is a distraction.The novel has the feel of a ""cozy,"" but then we have pedophilia thrown into the plot out of the blue. And a small town coroner is hardly equipped to pronounce a person's cause of death--that takes a medical examiner and usually lots of time spent in forensics. And seriously, a rotting dead body smells to high heaven and is unlikely to lie around in an attic un-noticed.My edition is riddled with typos, from a police officer named ""Luscious"" to a character named Harley or Haley, depending upon which page you are on, to someone who crosses his ""heat"" and hopes to die."
2,Long and Unconvincing,"We expect a more or less implausible set of circumstances underlying a mystery novel. This one, however, comes with two implausible subplots to boot. The local color seems based largely on stereotypes from Southern Appalachia rather than anything you'd be likely to find in south-central Pennsylvania. The heroine/narrator endangers herself worse than Kinsey Millhone. In all, a mystery chosen at random from your local bookstore's shelves is likely to please more than this one."
2,"Nice Photographs, Just Ignore the Text","I picked this book to learn more about kayaking around the Puget Sound, but was immediately turned off by the pretentious tone of prose. Although the pictures are fatastic, the narrative oozes of self-satisfaction and is full of dropped names that do nothing to enhance the tale of the kayaking journey."
3,For Management???,"Well, I've got to go through this bunch of pages once more in the next two weeks and believe me: Even boys and girls doing an mba should know more about IT than what is featured in this text. The third star is just for the reduced weight, compared to the previous edition. So, people, look around for something that covers ISO/OSI, TCP/IP in a better way..Yours sincerely.."
5,Great foundation,Made with natural rice powder and you can use it wet or dry or apply it to take the shiny parts in the face. It is really nice finishing and long lasting.
1,DB Roth lens kit for Sony dsc-1,"I ordered a lense kit for my camera - a sony cybershot dsc-1 from DB Roth. The ad was clearly marked as applicable for this model. Upon receipt, none of the lenses or filters fit. I returned this item, four weeks later still waiting for a refund. Big waste of time, dont bother."
4,Super Reader,"The young slayer, August, refuses to stop fighting until either she, or Buffy, is dead, so another Slayer will rise to continue fighting.She loses, and Buffy uses her body as a distraction to break out of her cell next time they come to feed her.She is horrified by what is out there, but manages to contact the Council, who tell her they will send an extraction team.It is a grown up version of her friends, but the bad news is what happened to Giles.In her own time, Willow realises the Prophet has taken over Buffy's body, and that there is little they can do to stop her."
4,Room to Grow,This top is not only well made but it's the first maternity top that I have purchased that actually has appropriate room to 'grow' without it looking like it is painted to my body. Cute design and soft lace.
1,Totally different from other discs. Not recommended.,Her aim was to be different but different isn't always good. I was very dissatisfied with the disc. The arrangements and her vocal projections were most unsatisfactory. I look foward to the return of the other Ann Hampton Callaway.
1,"Deco only, Junk","Short, loose, unsealed, don't even extend past the gap between the threads. The plastic stock parts are better except for the fact that they always seem to break. These will definitely not even slow down water entering the valve area."
4,Get the job done,I bought these to replace the flimsy plastic ones that come with Presta inner tubes (which break all the time). These will never break and look pretty classy.
3,Not as great as it sounds,"First of all, the handle may be recycled plastic (which I thought was the greatest idea), but the silly plastic tube it comes in is, ahem, NOT RECYCLABLE. Huh? Second, the toothbrush head is way too small for my 8 year old's mouth, and definitely on the cusp of too small for my 6 year old. Bummed I wasted my money on this."
3,Break down quickly,Easy for young children to hold (mine are 2 and 4) but the bristles break down quickly and look worn after only a week or two of use.
3,Bent bristles,"Product came as described with 2 orange, 2 green and 2 pink brushes. Unfortunately 4 of the six brushes had their bristles bent atthe time of packing into the recycline plastic case. They wont straighten now.Must be some quality issue. I have bought the same product in the past and not had this issue (thus the 3 stars)"
1,"TERRIBLE DVD, DON'T BUY IT.","I agree with Aimee: ""I am very sorry that I bought this DVD. Harijiwan looks insane and there is nothing at all about him that is calming, he has angry eyebrows, screams at you to go faster like a drill sergeant and his inhaling is so loud it just about gave me a heart attack. The video is pretty bad quality and there is no music or anything, just loud insane breathing the whole time""Don't buy it is terrible!!! The kriya is very common and simple.Instead buy the Maya Fiennes DVD's or Gurmukh or Gurutej, they are good kundalini yoga Dvd'sThe worst of all is the Insane Breathing and the face of Harijiwan!!!"
1,Scary,"I am very sorry that I bought this DVD. Harijiwan looks insane and there is nothing at all about him that is calming, he has angry eyebrows, screams at you to go faster like a drill sergeant and his inhaling is so loud it just about gave me a heart attack. The video is pretty bad quality and there is no music or anything, just loud insane breathing the whole time. I couldn't even look at his face because he was creeping me out so bad with his eyes rolling all over the place up inside his head, I mean can't he close his eyelids. I can definitely take the corniness of Ana and Ravi's dvds any day over this cuckoo. I hope I can at least make back some of my money reselling this."
2,not better than other kundalini yoga,I was not impressed.I rather anna brett yoga dvd.IT was exagerated in the breathing etc
5,Over the top,I bought this cover for my 9 year old grandaughter. The quality was amazing. She thought it was a plush stuffed animal instead of a head cover for her golf clubs. Amazing for the price!
3,Not what I was hoping for but still good,This was my third purchase in the Berit Olam series and I was a little disappointed. Other commentaries in this series provided a passage by passage commentary. This particular took a broader view and implied more more usage statistics and historical accounts of word usage.It was a good commentary but not what i was expecting when I purchased it. A more careful reading of the book description would have told me that though...so in reality it was purely my own fault.
3,Interesting and well-plotted. Good debut novel.,"Alexander Irvine's, _A Scattering of Jades_ is an interesting work of historical occult fiction set in 1840's America.The novel is well-plotted, and full of those interesting factoids that are required to create an interesting ""parallel history"". The reader learns interesting tidbits on topics ranging from ""The Burr Conspiracy"" (an actual historical event I had never heard of) to the origins of New York's Tammany Hall.Have you ever heard of Harman Blennerhasset? St. Tammany? Me neither. Mix these elements with Aztec mysticism, throw in Mammoth Cave for good measure, and you've got yourself a story!If the novel has a shortcoming, it is the character development, which I felt could have been stronger. The characters always felt distant to me, giving the whole affair a rather clinical, cold, feeling.Overall, I recommend this novel, especially to those of us who are in to this genre."
5,"A true reader's , great read!","The characters , story , and writing ; all are superblycomposed! Quite simply one of the best books I've readin some time! A work very well done by this author,who ifhe sticks to this formula, he can't lose!!!"
3,a series winds down,"James Lee Burke at his worst is better than most mystery writers at their best. This is probably the least compelling of the Robicheaux series, but it's still enough to keep you turning the pages.I couldn't help feeling that I'd read all this before, though. The haunting descriptions of light and water and Louisiana weather and love-making -- they all bear a slight hint of boilerplate now, stuff pulled from a bag of literary material and bolted on where necessary. Also, the plotting here seems a bit more careless, with at least a couple bits of deus ex machina toward the end that a struggling writer would not dare to use.I can recommend ""Sunset Limited"" for the atmosphere and the characters, but would urge those new to the series to start with the earlier titles -- ""Neon Rain"" comes to mind as one of the best. JLB has had a great run with Robicheaux, but maybe now it's time to give him and New Iberia a little R&R."
2,Sunset Limited,"I wonder if the title of this work should be ""James Lee Burke Limited""? I feel he has overdone, overreached, and over worked Robicheaux...possibly a new protagonist would be a welcome relief from what I feel has become the commonplace.Although his characterizations are fine and varied they are not necessarily Burke's best. Maybe now, about twenty books later, he should spend some time developing a story line featuring Helen Soileau....I think he has worked Robicheaus to death! ""Sunset Limited"" was a complex read, not a riveting read, but moreso an unsatisfying read.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
1,"Overwritten, violent attempt at Southern gothic novel","I like this series but this latest edition makes me wonder why. I was raised in the South and lament the long shadow it casts over everything in the U.S., but Burke's book is just one violent spray of blood after another. Too often the critics think only violence makes for characterization. The South has a clotted history but Southern men like Ken Starr are more damaging to the national psyche than the swamp things that rise up in this novel."
3,the weakest Robicheaux tale yet,"After reading most of Burke's Robicheaux novels in a row this summer, I found SUNSET LIMITED to be the weakest. The plot was confusing and Burke is throwing around to many charakters and names. But most of all I was missing Burke's atmospheric description of the southern landscape Robicheaux is living in."
3,"Adequate, but not his best work","I am a big James Lee Burke fan and waiting on his latest with Robicheaux is like smelling bacon frying. Unfortunately this one did not taste as well as previous ones, although I was glad to see him return to the Robicheaux series.I don't have a lot of complaints, just felt I wasn't into the characters, including Streak, as much as his other books. The good news is that Burke is still the best at this genre, even for one I like somewhat less than his previous. BLACK CHERRY BLUES is still my favorite and I make a habit of rereading all of his Robicheaux books from time to time. Keep em coming, JLB!"
2,Good Bye Dave Robicheax,"By saying goodbye to Dave Robicheaux I suppose I am saying goodbye to James Lee Burke. I can only say ""thank you"" to James Lee Burke since he has provided me many great hours of entertainment with his Robicheaux novels; but Robicheaux may have died in ""Sunset Limited"" because I gave up on page 258. I found the characters and the plot confusing, and I would have been happy if a bomb had killed eveyone on page 50.Apparently, the characters from ""Cimarron Rose"" are going to take up Mr. Burke's time, and since I didn't care for this book I am not going to read anymore James Lee Burke for awhile. I will keep up with Burke's review's here at Amazon, and as soon as he scores a five with more than 20 readers I will try again."
3,"Nice dialogue, ok plot","The writing itself is not bad; the dialogue matches what I would expect of Louisiana and the characters are well defined. BUT, I found the plot jumpy and the author expected us to take some great leaps on faith, or just assumed the direction he took would make sense. Though I found the plot to jump around, the book still was interesting and well written enough for me to want to read it and care about the outcome. A good ""airplane"" or ""long drive"" book."
2,Kind of flat...it didn't really catch my eye,"The story never really caught fire. Perhaps because I'm new to the characters and the series, I didn't really care that much about what happened. In that way, this book is like Leonard's Cuba Libra where, once again, nothing really seems to happen. And by way of comparison, if one wants excellent stories and great writing, this pales in comparison to Ian Rankin's series and his character D.I. Rebus."
1,"Boring, boring, boring","Having tried to read a few of Burke's trashy books, this one was really lousy and boring."
3,Dave and James seem to be getting tired.,"As a die hard Dave Robicheaux fan I was somewhat disappointed with this last installment. It seemed to me that Mr. Burke assumed that every reader had the background knowledge of his previous books and spent very little time developing the characters during the first 100 pages. The story did come together eventually but the reader was left with a less than ""wow"" ending. I have found that successful, prolific writers begin to lose their edge after so many best sellers. I hope that this isn't happening to James Lee Burke."
3,"Fun, but not the strongest of Burke's novels","After having read all of the Dave Robicheaux novels, I was somewhat disappointed with this latest novel. While it was good to re-enter the world of Burke's novels, I felt there was something missing. The characters, as usual, were strong, but the plot seemed to fall short of the typical Burke novel."
2,A Great Disappointment from a Burke Fan,"I was very disappointed in this book, with its incoherent plot -- meanderings is a better term for it. It seems that JLB is getting bored with the Dave Robicheaux character; perhaps his publisher had him in a corner. The characters seem flat, almost prop-like, as if he pulled them out of a Louisiana studio. Although some are, of course, colorful and eccentric, they do not make up for the essential flaw of this book, which is that its plot is confusing and not engaging enough to keep the reader's interest.I am a JLB fan from way back and hope that he can recapture some of his great writing ability."
4,"Good, but not great Burke/Robicheaux.","Like other reviewers here I think Burke and Robicheaux are getting tired. They both need a rest...Burke is now writing about Texas and Streak is kinda lost in the bayou. I loved the book, however, but it's not Burke's best. I did, however, enjoy the strengthening as a character of Robicheaux' partner Helen Soileau. Maybe she'll take on a life of her own in a future book. Anyhow, I'm a sucker for Robicheaux and think I'll just go back and start re-reading the series."
4,Great Atmosphere In This Burke Novel,"The atmosphere in this one is up to par with everything Burke has written, although the plot may be a little murky. Particularly compelling is Dave's relationship with his daughter and how it influences his actions and his thoughts. The novel moves from one of Burke's favorite locations - deep south - to another - Montana wilds. If you like Burke's writing, this one will please you. If you haven't discovered him, you're in for a real treat."
5,James Lee Burke gives us great plots and great characters.,"Reading the latest Dave Robicheaux novel is pure pleasure. Burke is a great writer and the plot of this book will keep your little grey cells alive. It's been a great week, because I just finished a book by an equally compelling writer (in a much lighter vein). I recommend Carl Hiaasen in general, but I just finished one of his earlier books, ""Double Whammy"" and thought it was great."
2,Too many psychopaths for one book.,"The standard characters of the series are first-rate and have come into their own. Here, the meanies were leftovers from a horror flick, although Mr. Burke's Montana experience with 'movie geeks' (where they abound) may have influenced him. Mr. Burke is a talented writer, but has squandered his talent in this book."
5,The best lavender scent for sale.,I have used this product for years. I spray it on my body and clothing and on my pillow before going to sleep.
3,Buy 'Classic Connolly' (box set),Classic Connolly and More Classic Connolly are both in the box set!
3,Music in the Genes!,"Robin Thicke is the son of Alan Thicke (Canadian actor and singer) and Gloria Loring (American actress and singer). His musical album here is quite a variation of music and styles. He could be rapping in one song and singing in another with friends like Faith Evans, Lil Wayne, and Pharell to accompany him.I have to say that the album is unusual in selection of songs. Each song is unique and different from another which is fine. But I found the musical compilation to be too wide varied for my taste. I enjoy the smooth rhythm and blues style over the rapping songs anyway. I think Robin Thicke still needs to find his voice and style while he is very talented and this compilation is a good example of it. In my opinion, he still has more to go in evolving his styles and tastes.I do look forward to more mature Robin Thicke perhaps maybe including his parents to accompany him in the future. I do see plenty of promise in his talents."
5,Nick's SOOO Under-Appreciated,"Nick Carter's solo album has been ignored ever sice it;s relese, which is truly a shame due to the wonderful work on this the album. If you like Nick Carter, you MUST add this CD to your collection. ""Rockstar Baby"" is perhaps one of Nick's best songs, and it's too bad it did not make the final cut for his album. It's a really sexy song and his voice has a very seductive tone to it. The lyrics are outstanding, but the beats are sexy, it just makes you wanna get up and do a really hot dance. Of course the song is good, Nick wrote it! ""I Got You"" is one of the best songs off his album, so its nice to have the single of it, and of course, the music video. As always, Nick is total eye candy for all of his viewers. So, quit reading this review, and go add the CD to your shopping cart!"
5,MY SECOND FAVORITE SONG FROM THE CD,"This song, like ""Do I Have To Cry For You"", ""Who Needs The World"" and ""Heart Without A Home"" demonstrates Carter's maturing abilities as laying down a ballad as well as a song of deeper qualities opposed to his party anthems either here or with BSB.So what makes this one of my favorites from Nick's solo effort? Simply put; it's hypnotic melodies and the beat which is dancy but not your typical club beat which is evident in so many dance songs. Of course the lyrics are catchy, great to sing along to and go perfectly well with the music. Nick's solo effort could have benifited more with songs like this as well as ""Help Me"" which comes off almost as a Christian (or spiritual)song without sounding ""preachy"" and having a rock/pop feel.Now as for my favorite song from this album, will it is titled: ""Blow Your Mind"" which is the ultimate ride of your life on this cd. I will review it when/if it comes out as a single."
4,"Interesting, but.....","...over processed. The label went a little overboard on the noise reduction. There's a definate ""digital"" sound to the CD. It's an interesting collection though. Great liner notes and a good variety of Hit Of The Week records."
1,The Artistic Integrity of Capitalism?,"I think it's funny that these people use the words ""commercials"" and ""acting"" in the same breath. Ya, the acting community is real proud of your performance in the Hershey's chocolate-bar commercial. Grow a brain!"
5,PERFECT Book for Anybody Wanting to Break into the Biz!,"What can i say about this book, that already hasn't been said by other readers. This book is a perfect resource for anybody wanting to get more information and pointers on how to approach commercials. This book has single handedly made me more aware of what i should expect, in turn making more informed and a better commercial actor...If your serious about trying to break into commercials, you definately need this book!"
3,A great pickup,"I went to the christian store near where I live. one of the employees came up and asked me what kind of music I liked, then he suggested this cd. I must say it was a great pickup. i have enjoyed listening to it over the years.#7 cool, is one of my favorite tracks."
3,Very comfortable and a good price but....,"The airline style sleep masks arrived very quickly, and it's difficult to get the quantity for the price. They are a good cost and are very comfortable to wear. But, the problem is that due to the type of fabric that is used, after just a few uses, they begin to have an unpleasant odor. This is easily fixed by handwashing the mask every week or so."
1,not,"Music for people who are not really interested in music, but have a fixation about Morrissey. Oh, and who mean to get around to reading some poetry sometime, but have never actually done it. Now watch me swish my gladioli, aint I artistic?"
5,"the icon, the legend, the lyricist","Morrissey is the closest thing to Arthur Rimbaud that we have in this day and age. His music is unique, innovative, immaginative, uncomprimising, and also downright funny. His voice sounds, remarkably, as good or better than it ever did in his over 20 year career. 'Earls Court' is by far his greatest live recording to date - the sound quality is amazing. Morrissey is also one of those remarkable vocalists, like Frank Sinatra, who never sings a song the same way twice - always something fresh in his approach. 'Friday Mourning', 'Redondo Beach' and 'November Spawns a Monster' are my favorite tracks."
4,'Beethoven' is better,"Long time fans may be a little disappointed with Earls' Court as it doesn't have the energy and spontaneity of 'Beethoven was Deaf'the live offering released in 1993 which featured so many songs from 'Your Arsenal'. Morrissey should have held to his statement,""Reggae is Vile"" and omitted Patti Smith's Redondo Beach.Likewise, The version of 'Bigmouth Strikes Again'here is toothless and non-threatening whereas the live version on the Smiths ""Rank"" taped in October of 1986 was nasty and aggressive.Of course when the Mozzer is given 18 chances, he succeeds more often than not. 'How Soon is Now?', the opening track, is excellent, brooding and menacing and well -rehearsed without being generic. My favorite is ""Shoplifters of The World, Unite"", and the b-sides ""Don't make fun of Daddy's voice"" and 'Friday Mourning' are welcomed here as it saves completists money and the inconvenience of buying more cd-singles released by the greedy Attack Records machine."
5,A must read,"For anyone who has been, is, or will be in a relationship (that's everyone) this book is a must read. Gila Manolson writes with humor, but without under-estimating the importance of the subject."
4,A Rogue fan MUST,"Fiona Avery truly does a wonderful job on everyone's favorite Southern belle's start. She mentioned in an interview that she was told to leave out anything relating to Carol Danvers and the Brotherhood, but considering that, she gives life to Rogue's past, and when Rogue joins the X-Men. Rogue comes to life and draws you into her story, even bringing tears to your eyes during the third icon in the series. This really is a wonderful piece of work to own, especially for those who adore Rogue."
1,Missing Lamborghini,"How can you have a book on ""supercars"" and leave out Lamborghini? Unforgivable - regardless of how the author feels about the raging bull, to not have cars like the Miura and Countach mentioned puts this book in a questionable quality bracket."
3,Nice book,"Lots of good car stories. Only thing though, I bought it for my son who likes the new fancy cars..."
4,Not too shabby...,"I purchased these just because they were very little more than regular coaxial speaker. They do sound a bit ""bright"" so I would recommend turning the tweeter to -3 on the crossover. Installation was very simple and the package has everything you'll need to install."
3,tweeters,the tweeters did not work..... i had a set of alipne tweeters and they work just fine mids and cross over are good but would be nice to have my tweeters replaced.
3,"Read as a Classic, like Beat the Dealer","L.G. Holloway's classic gambling manual has good historical value. It is an easy read, especially with his straight forward, common sense approache to many of the popular table games. However, like PhD Thorpe's tome, most of the information is more valuable, historically, than practically.However, for gamblers aspiring for a full time profession or profitable hobby, the practical wisdom contained in the book is invaluable."
5,The Condemed,This movie was very entertaining. Alot of action and kept me awake.The dvd arrived on time and I'm very stisfied with the service provided to me.

4,"Can I Get A ""Hell Yeah""?","Way better than expected. Stone Cold Steve Austin is as much fun to watch on the big screen as he was when he was a superstar in the WWE. This movie sets a nice, high bar for action adventure. Far better than the played out and repeated crap that usually comes out of Hollywood. It is time to start taking some of these stars seriously, as they a far more entertaining than most of the rest of the Hollywood stable. I look forward to Stone Cold's next venture into film. If it is half as exciting as this, it will be a hit in my book."
5,Awesome movie!!,"Great movie! Good action, story, and just overall good! Some people just hate it because the WWE is involved. Watch it and be the judge for yourself."
4,"Heck, yeah!","This is one of the best action movies I've seen. Ever. Granted, it may not have been the best concept, and some bits were kinda tough to watch, but they did a darn good job with in on the whole. I liked it way more than The Marine, and Stone Cold is a better actor than John Cena. The difference is that with Stone Cold, I could tell a difference between Jack Conrad the guy I see in the WWE ring every now and then. Good cinematography, and excellent fight sequences.My point is, this is a great action movie, Stone Cold is not just a stomper of mud holes, and I can see an improvement in the quality of WWE's movies. Hopefully they'll do even better with future productions."
1,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A terrible quasi-remake of Battle Royale leavened with some of the most ham-handed and hypocritical social commentary any movie has ever offered, The Condemned has absolutely nothing to recommend it; action fans will be disappointed at the predictable and poorly-directed fight scenes and anyone who can't turn off their brain will be appalled."
2,Meh,"It was better than I expected it to be ( had pretty low expectations), but at the same time its already been done.I guess this one can be the english version. Otherwise go see Battle Royale. They do it better, and with the same idea, except with kids instead of inmates."
4,loved it,never saw the previews but my opinoin it was fantrastic there all prisonera aND EVERYPERSON FOR THEMSELVES just crazy all the way thru
4,review,brother in law loved the movie ...was given as gift ...would reccomend for people to ck out the site i got it from
3,7.1 surround unavailable on PS3,"This is a good action packed movie. I bought it for the mere fact that it had 7.1 surround sound, only to find out that PS3 does not support DTS-HD 7.1. Hopefully PS3, which is the most used blu-ray player can have an update to support this audio format. If you have a PS3, don't expect to get this in 7.1 surround sound."
4,The little book of chills and thrills,"If you love Halloween you will be sure to love this little book of chills and thrills.The artwork is amazing, it just makes you want to keep flipping through the pages."
4,"When they say ""Little Big"", they mean it","I bought this book on a whim from Barnes and Noble and was not disappointed. First of all, I love vintage prints, products, and artwork especially for the holidays. This is a cute Halloween book full of old-fashion pictures, easy recipes, famous scary stories and poems, and blurbs about superstitions. For children it even has a hand full of magic tricks (that really work) and 'spells' (for ""those aspiring wizards and witches""). Whether you are a vintage aficionado or a child who loves Halloween, this book is a great keepsake."
3,Too much noise,"It's Enigma... but different. This is more like a pop/techno set than his other stuff. There's a lot of tinny, flaky background noise. There are some places where the noise is used as an instrument to play bars of the song or a pattern, but otherwise it just makes me wonder if I've blown a speaker. 3 stars because Enigma totally rules and there are some good sections of music amongst the noise."
2,A Little Disappointing....,"I was expecting more from this single, and so I am disappointed in the overall package. I like that Enigma takes chances and tries new things, but at the end of this song, I just feel empty, like so much more could have been done with it, especially with the background choir-type voices and beat. I'll still listen to it, but it is by far not on my list of greatest Enigma music."
2,is the real enigma solved?,"wow!!!Enigma is going worse in every new release after ""The screen behind the mirrow"" It's simple,there""s not enigma anymore...Im a fan of the old project,the real mystic enigma.I got all cds and every single from the begining...Sorry M.Cretu,but this is crap..."
2,Not what I expected - there is better out there.,"It gets a ""so-so"" for me. On the down side, the recipes are not that exciting - nor is it the ""BEST burrito in the world."" I was looking for something more than cooked mashed pinto beans and chopped canned jalapenos in a flour tortilla shell (that's REALLY all the burrito was stuffed with!) covered with a red enchillada sauce. On the plus side - the chocolate cake recipe is very good - and is the same as one found in Regan Daley's ""In the Sweet Kitchen."" Many of the dessert recipes contain more sugar than is probably healthful, but they are lower in fat. There are better vegan cookbooks out there. I recommend some of the books by Robin Robertson (Vegan Planet) or Donna Klein (Mediterranean Vegan Kitchen), or even recipes from Dr. John McDougall's website www dot drmcdougall dot com, which are free!"
5,I was scared to death!!,"Doretta Johnson's story was extrememly unnerving. It actually brought to light for my sister and I the paranormal activity that occurred in our home over a decade ago. The things she experienced made my sister and I remember the ""weird"" phenomena we now recognize as poltergeists and ghosts. Although her hauntings have not stopped, I applaude Doretta for having ALL the courage to keep on trying...she is a heroine."
5,Adaptor caps,"The adaptor caps with the hoses are very functional. Good price. ""what you see is what you get""good deal"
4,good goop for bedtime,"This ointment is a good product and it is also very cheap. Use it when you go to bed, so that you don't wake up with hot sandpaper-y eyes. Or apply when you take a break with your eyes closed for a few minutes. It's a lot like vasoline, but purified for your eyes."
5,Arthropods to Mammals,"Ziegler covers every topic in Hawaiian Natural History: Invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. Also there are interesting chapters on Geology as well. If you are wondering where the evolution is in the book, there is a nice chapter on evolution's history and concepts. It has been mentioned that Ziegler devotes particular care to the traditional Hawaiian names of animals and plants and that is the case. There is also a chapter on the history of the Polynesians and another on their ecology. There are separate chapters for birds, mammals and even snails. Nice tables list endemic species as well as indigenous and alien. I found the book rather boring to read cover to cover but that is my particular taste. I am a biology student but not working in the field. Perhaps this book would serve as a reference."
5,Best John Wayne Movies,"These are the two best films John Wayne has ever been in (even though they are all great). I would recommend this to anyone whether you're a John Wayne/Western fan or not. El Dorado is my favorite western movie, but if you're not into westerns Hatari is a great film."
4,John Wayne Classics,"We bought this movie duo because my 4 year old son LOVED Hatari. El Dorado is a little on the slow side, but it's a bonus movie for my husband to enjoy. We can't get enough of the baby elephants in Hatari...so cute and entertaining!"
1,doesn't work,"One handed? That has to be a joke. Bag goes on easy enough but doesn't ""scoop"". It just pushes the poop around instead of it going into the bag. You need some kind of other device to make it go into the bag. Reminds me of trying to pick up dust from the floor without a broom, just using the dust pan. If I gotta pick up poop at least sell me something that works."
5,A super scooper,"Great idea. Works quite well. Then thin front edge of the scooper makes getting under ""things"" much simpler. The bags can last for several trips before being replaced; that depends on your tolerance of the contents. I suggest holding below the handle's mid line when scooping, as these tend to break at the connection joint (the junction of the two part handle) over time if the joint isn't coddled. Still worth it."
2,Amazon gave me a refund,"I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD, though the initial description said so. But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price. Appreciate their gesture.Agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with. It took a *lot* of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile.Yeah, not very happy with this product.p.s: Contrastingly, had a bad experience with Dell on a similar situation when I bought a Nikon camera. Dell blamed the wrong description on Nikon and expectedly, Nikon blamed Dell. Neither owned up the error. But Amazon was pretty good. I really appreciate it."
4,"2 excellent movies,1 average",I love DOWN TO EARTH & HEAD OF STATE. The dvd is worth buying for those 2 films. POOTIE TANG isn't so funny.
2,Difficult to turn pages,"I've put off reviewing this product, because I don't really like it. The squared rings make it difficult to turn pages, putting unnecessary wear and tear on the page holes. Also, this binder doesn't have any more capacity than some of the round ring binders we have. I thought it would hold a lot more."
4,"Great for school notes, but doesn't fit well on a shelf","During my undergrad and grad schools, I had tons of looseleaf notes and handouts. These work well to consolidate the stuff I use for reference occasionally. The only thing I'm not really happy about is that they are a little long when you put them on a shelf. This makes them stick out of the shelf farther than books and other binders I have."
4,Overall happy,"They are a little smaller than I expected ... more like a 3 1/2"" to me but they will work. They seem to be good and sturdy and will work well for a large report that I'm putting together."
4,Great binders at a great price,"These are just what we needed for our office at a better price than what was available at the office supply store. They did arrive a bit dusty/dirty, but it was nothing a little elbow grease couldn't take care of."
3,Rhapsody in Blue - one cut really worthwhile,Michael Camilo performs an outstanding rendition of Gershwin's classic. I expected additional renditions on this CD.
2,Help me Rhonda,"The blindfold is colorful, but very cheaply made. I knew it would fall apart after the first 5 kids, so I used it as a pattern to make my own out of felt."
3,It's ok,I bought this for my daughter's pinata party. We didn't use it but my son unraveled it in an hour.
3,Decent for the price,"The chain is a little thin and the kids say the seat is not as comfortable as the other swing seats, but for the price it's a decent buy. I just received the swing 3 days ago, so I cannot speak about the durability, but it appears it should last a couple of years."
2,returned,We returned this seat because of weight rating. In the information there was no indication of weight limits. Ths weight rating was in the package material though. We were looking for an adult rated seat and this one is only rated @ 115 lb.
4,Grandmom,Looked all over locally for a swing this nice for an existing swing set. Price was fair and it is heavy duty.
3,SO far so good!,I've owned it for a couple of months and so far they are in good shape and have not broken. I'm still a little concerned bc some other reviews said they could come break at any moment when DD swings on it. But for the price so far I am really pleased with them.
5,Great swing!,I ordered this swing (actually two of them) to replace my step 2 swings that broke. The instructions were quite easy to follow. My kids love them. They are much better than the step 2 swings that came with the swing set. The chains are covered so they don't hurt the kids hands. They won't break like my step 2 swings did. I would highly reccomend these swings to anyone looking to buy a swing for their swing set.
4,Good swing for the price,"I won't rave about this swing. Mine came pinched in the middle from being folded and packaged to tight. But it works just fine. For the price I paid it meets my expectations.I noticed some other customers had some safety issues. The hooks that attach to the swing are very hard to bend and close all the way so that the toy is safe. Otherwise it would fall off mid swing. I simply used a hammer and made sure they were all the way closed.As long as you make sure the hooks are closed everything else about this swing is fine. The chains are covered with plastic, the seat itself is durable. If you're on a budget this is an excellent product. I do not regret buying this swing."
5,"I'ts just a seat, and it's a good one.",Seems soft and durable. Great product. Not sure what you would gain with a more expensive one. Other reviewers complained about bending hooks on their swingset to make this work. I had no problem at all. Highly recommended. Much better than the seat that came with the swing.
4,individual Swing Seat for existing swing set.,"When purchasing this, I would have preferred alittle more description on this seat. It is durable, but not for older children. I would say no more than 50, 60 lbs max on the weight for this product. It's made for younger children.Swing Seat"
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased 2 seats in April of 2012 and was shorted the chains for one of the swing seats. I didn't realize it until I opened the second swing recently. I called the company to have them send me the missing chains. They sent new chains that are different from the original chains that were on the other swing. The new chains were smaller and not as strong and heavy duty. I called them back and their response was they changed the company that supplies the chains and are not using the heavy duty chains anymore. They will send me a new seat but it doesn't solve the problem of the poor quality. I will take the swing chains to the hardware store and replace them with a better quality chain, but I definitely would not purchase these swings again and am very disappointed in the response I received from the manufacturer. I do not trust these seats with the new chains."
5,Terrific Swing,"This is a great swing. It is soft plastic and has a very durable chain running through the bottom. The chain is dipped in a coating for the first few feet and it fairly long - probably five or six feet.The only negative is that the seat arrives folded in two, so there is a crease in the middle that quickly goes away."
4,Great product for the price,"Very inexpensive, but well made! I love the coated handles because I don't worry about my 2 year old son getting his fingers pinched or hair caught in the chain. I like it better than the rubber tubing because no mildew can grow up inside. Great product!"
4,Good Quality,Very good swing seats and the price was excellent - Grandchildren were thrilled to have new swings and play on them all the time
5,Swing Seat,Good quality strong material plastic covering on the chan to keep the kids hands safe. it is what it is a swing seat and chain
2,OK swing seat,I have the Swing and Slide set but I did not realize that the seat and the change are not one piece. So the hooks you see with the black rubber casing in the picture frequently come undone . I hate always restringing the change through the seat ..... boo..
4,Unabashedly critical yet insightful,"Although this book considers many practitioners of therapy anathema, the author does enumerate thoughtful reasons as to why. It maginifies the possible harm humanistic/analytic/behavior indoctrination can cause. What's lacking is a comprehensive take on his therapy of choice. His crticisms of certain therapies should culminate into the final portions of his book, one that should exact a thorough depiction of his idea of beneficial therapy, one that should be so overwhelmingly insightful and seemingly obvious - inversely tantamount to his criticisms of pages earlier. You may ask why I appoint this book a 4. Well, it's immensely readable, peculiarly enjoyable, and instills you with a oscillating perception of whether or not the critique is true. I'm attracted to this book because its contentions are those that can be discussed, not thrown away."
1,Not worth buying,I could barely get through the book due to the way that that the author seemed to seeth with sarcastic anger at any type of therapy he didn't approve of. It didn't seem the least bit objective and he gave every evidence of being someone with an axe to grind. His own suggestions for therapy seemed astonishingly naive. He seemed to totally miss the importance of a person's emotional dynamics and he completely fails to understand the fact that interpersonal relationships are often multilevel. Don't waste your money.
3,Good for people who have studied clinical psychology.,"It's easy to read and has great explanations of what exactly is psychotherapy. Being trained in psychology myself, it's a good course book for a beginning clinical psychology major who's not interested in becoming a psychologist. One may imagine learning more from other books such as taking a course from Dr. Andrew M. Barclay at Michigan State University. He has more material than this average guy. Too much over criticism of the profession of psychotherapy written all over this book. I've read better psychology books than this. You're better off reading non-psychology books such as Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig. Pirsig would comment on this book as being ""static quality"" and not ""dynamic quality."" It's the average run of the mill psychology book that will end up at the resale bookstores!"
1,Jesse Liberty Fails to Update the Errata,"After spending many hours trying to figure why the sample code didn't work, I found the answer buried on Jesse Liberty's message board. A fellow reader points out an error on Jan 21 and as of June 26 Jesse has yet to update his errata. Most tech books have a decent size errata and that is to be expected, but for an author to fail in his responsibility at the cost of many collective hours by his readers is extremely inconsiderate. This book is in my trash can at the moment."
5,"No fluff, just useful stuff.","I really, really like this book. If you are new to programming, this might not be the best book. Get an introductory book, then get this one. If you are a vb.net coder beginning asp.net, this is THE book. Jesse Liberty covers in a few hundred pages, what other books take six or seven hundred to do. Excellent book. I will be buying more from this author. Very professional."
3,"fun read, but slightly incomplete.","If you got this around the time it was published, it was gold. after 2007, probably not so much. Some of the chapters reference software that needs to be downloaded from the publisher/author's website. Can be problematic. Skill set and info is pretty darn good, though."
3,Not a complete transition to VB.Net,"I absolutely love Jesse's books and articles. However, this book does not have a page dedicated to ADO.Net nor does Jesse talk about the debugging methods of VS 2005.I understand writing a book is not easy, but I feel these are two critical components of .Net development"
1,Climbing rope,Save your money on this climbing rope it is so thin I would have been better off using some old rope that I had stored in my garage. It is way over priced for the quality of this item.Paul
1,NO ENGLISH closed captions for the hearing impaired,NO ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED. Another missed Purchased.Would have liked to have seen this one too.
1,"A bad, bad book","This book wasn't even written by Tom Clancy (a fact made clear on the cover in much smaller print than the rest).The book is remarkable in that so little happens in the first 400 pages of the book that you think that there will have to be a sequel to sort out the problems that have been set up. In the event nothing is ever really sorted out and threads are left dangling.I know that many people don't associate TC with fine literature, but his books have a rhythm and pace that few others match. This book has nothing of the sort.Mr Clancy, I am surprised that you allow such a book to be written by someone else and have your name on the cover.You have lost a reader."
2,Not what I was expecting. I did finish it.,"I finished the book so it gets 2 stars. If I can't make it through only one. Most of the book seem to be setting up the characters and not much is happening. Action packed it is not, but there is a little which is how I made it through. I loaned it from the library, don't waist your money. It is definitely not worth it."
1,I lost hours of my life that I can't get back.,"Pretty simple review here....one of the worst novels I have ever read. Nothing happens except rambling about the characters inner thougths and how they are dressed. I'm disappointed Tom Clancy would put his name to this book, I wonder if he even read it before letting it go to print."
1,Not worth the effort,I tried to listen to an audio tape and found myself repeatedly losing interest. Half way through I returned the tape to the library.
1,Stay away!,"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. The only reason I read it was a twenty hour flight with no other options. The french quotes are the worst though, they make no sense and are misspelled and grammatically abysmal. Stay away at all cost!"
1,It doesn't get any better.,This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy reading Tom Clancy and perhaps that is why I saw the book all the way to the end. The book starts off slow and then ends way to quickly. I had gotten 2/3 through the book when I read the back cover and discovered that none of that had happened yet.I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is poorly written and is comparable to an extremely low budget film.
1,A disapointment,"This book has 421 pages and could be resumed in less than 150:First 25 pages, then ""girl loves dogs, daddy loves daughter, Gabon has some corruption, but it's ok, UpLink is a wonderful company but has some politics and some people don't like each other, the bad guy hates his father (and everyone else)"" and finally, the final 100 pages.I love when Tom Clancy writes and I am getting less and less excited when he just lends his name to someone else."
1,Waste of money,"These are a huge waste of money. After walking around for a couple of hours, the foam completely breaks down and is useless, and I'm not a heavy person either. I would not recommend these to anyone. I'm going back to the gel inserts. I'd rather spend the extra money and get something that works."
1,Total rip,Tiny ultra-thin layer of memory foam with cheap foam in the middle. Fell apart after one week. Total rip!! Do not buy!!
2,nothing great,over rated product. not really fantastic. it's a bit too soft and gives no cushioning effect.it just feels soft and that's about it.the texture doesnt feel good and do not really last.not going to buy again.
2,"In paraphrasing, the Rav is diminished","Although the author is diligent and respectful, the reader should be warned that these are mostly not the actual words of the Rav, but mere paraphrasings, catalogings, and re-statements. As the greatness of the Rav came not just from what he said, but how he said it, much is lost in the ""translation."" If you love the Rav, you may, like me, be disappointed."
2,Glue Gun with out Glue Stick,"Dear Seller,I can't rate your item because there was no any glue stick. I wouldn't mind to pay more but get at least one glue stick. Now, I can't find for mini Glue Gun ""mini stick"". Pointless to buy online instument without inlcuding accessory."
3,Buyers Advice yes its WIDESCREEN,Widescreen lovers enjoy it says 16x9 on the package about the format of the film but yes it is in the 1.85.1 widescreen theater aspect ratio format.
4,Good purchase,I bought this item for my wife and she was very happy with it. Happy with the time to receive it to the condition in was received.
4,Harper Valley P.T.A,70's movie with 70's stars. Good movie for it's time. Nice piece of 70's nastalgia.
3,Cute Movie! 3 1/2 Stars.,I have always liked the song of the same name that this movie got it's idea from and I saw the movie Harper Valley P.T.A. and I liked it. Barbara Eden (I Dream of Jeannie) is good as Stella and Susan Swift (Audrey Rose) is also good as her daughter Dee and the rest of the cast is alsp good! I'm glad this movie is finally on DVD and I would definitely buy this for my DVD collection but when I looked up the DVD info on Amazon here wasn't any info on the aspect rato. I hope it's widescreen and not pan and scan! This is a cute 3 1/2 star movie!
2,Not as good as I thought,"I liked the song and I thought the movie would be funny to watch with my 13 yr old daughter. I felt that some of the scenes were inappropriate, due to the nudity. The rating for this movie should be at least pg-13 or pg-14."
4,Best Adult Video that children can watch,"This video can be watched by children under age 13. The amount of violence, blood and gore is something today's movies need to reduce. I reproduced this movie in the two versions aired on TBS. I, hopefully, got the scenes in the correct order as shown in the theaters. My mother and I saw this on April 1, 1978, and I wish the studio would bring this out again. I would love to have an original version to keep as an heirloom."
1,The Gay Teen,This book was more of a text book. Not what I was looking for. Couldn't really tell from the description it gave.
4,Sing Brotha !!!!!!,"One of the best CD's i purchased this year !!! My attention was first grabbed by the first single "" love for a while"" with Shanice ...This duet is magic**** and is still on heavy rotation in my player....Sleek harmonies and extrodinary vocals continue on ""let's get away "" and I'm coming home""... The stand out track for me was ""chasing ""forever"" the combo of great lyric,vocal and arrangement... Being almost the male alter ego of Rachelle Farrelle and Nina simone i wish the set for this project was a few songs longer and more uptempo song...But at the end of the day, Jeremiah, u sing brotha !!!!! ure talent was far beyond my expectations...""it took me a minute now i realize I'm addicted to u ""lol God Bless U"
1,"I bought this DVD in september, 2006. But I have never received it.","I bought this DVD in september, 2006. But I have never received it."
2,I Kahnt see this again,"Why does everyone keep crying in this? Alright, Nathaniel is the sentimental son of Louis Kahn, and if it werent for his sentiments, we wouldnt have this film in the first place, but why is it so sad?I dont think I can see it twice, but maybe its worth seeing once. Let me suggest you something, maybe you see this on BBC as a documentary and life is good, but spare yourself the money buying the DVD..."
5,Wonderful Story of a Bastard Son,This is a documentary by a son of a man with 3 families. Nathaniel was the son from the youngest of the women. The father died when he was 11 and he never really knew him because the father lived with the wife he was married to. The man did visit at times and his mother always believed that he died while coming to visit them and move in forever. The man was a famous architect named Louis Kahn. He was highly revered in the architect world and it was a bit shocking that he had been hiding 3 families for many years from each other. They did not meet until the funeral. The son makes a very special film that haunts us with sadness. His interaction with his mother is the most moving. She is uncomfortable in talking with him and is bothered by his questions. A highly recommended film.
4,MY ARCHITECT: My Review,The video is a very well done documentation of a son's journey to get to know his father (Luis Kahn/famous architect). This is not a documentation on solely the work of Luis Kahn but on his personal life as well. I really enjoyed the personal discoveries the son made of his father through the interviews and visits (to the buildings). It was a good balance of showing off the two sides of Luis Kahn as an Architect and as an absent father.
3,movie,A little too dated and boring but interesting info especially for the teacher in me as I teach an arch class
4,Very touching film,"I had always been a big fan of Louis Kahn, and had visited many of his buildings. This film doesn't go into detail about his design concepts, but it does give an insight into his personal side. The pace is perfect for this type of film and overall it is a very touching film."
4,Great singer..,This is a great singer. Beautiful voice with a romantic trend. Highly recommended if you like soft music.
3,You Just Haven't Earned It Yet,"I was always sure that Johnny Marr put the M in Manchester. Maybe Morrissey put the ""chest"" in Manchester. Or the see-through sleeves."
4,This Man Has Preserved Himself Well,"As a lifelong fan, I honestly don't think that You are the Quarry is one of Morrissey's better albums, but he's still got some fierce stage presence. I saw this screened in New York the week of its release, and it's terrific. While his most recent songs sound kind of like a rehashing of his other stuff, he injects some real life into them with his live performance, and the Elvis-style stage set-up is pretty nice, too. He chooses a great varied selection of older material on here, and of course when he does ""There is a Light That Never Goes Out,"" everybody swoons."
5,Incredible! Morrissey put the M in Manchester!,"I saw this concert while on tour and it was truly great in-person. This DVD really captures the moment. Audio quality is shockingly great. The footage is top rate. If you like Morrissey, you'll love this video. It get's my highest recommendation!"
2,it arrived,"You know it came as expected but it doesn't play on my DVD player, the one hooked up to my surround sound. It plays on some cheap players I've tried it on, like a portable with a 7 in screen and a one inch speaker, but come on... Any way its probably not the shipper, the seller, or the manufactor's falt that my panasonic dvd player says its ""incompatible"" I just have to wait to see the movie in stereo on a large screen."
5,Superb folio of Céline Dion songs,"This amazing book (for piano, vocal, chords) contains the most beautiful songs of Céline Dions CD ""Let's Talk About Love"". It contains 15 titles: The Reason * Immortality * Treat her like a lady * Why oh why * Love is on the way * Tell him * Where is the love * When I need you * Miles to go (Before I sleep) * Us * Just a little bit of love * My heart will go on * I hate you then I love you * To love you more * Let's talk about love. It also contains some beautiful and official pictures of Céline..."
3,Military read,"I'm deployed, and bought this card, because i'm getting tired of spending a ridiculous amount of money for an att card, and all in all, i was happy with this, within a couple hours of ordering, i had the pin and access numbers through email. I highly recommend you call your base operator and connect to one of the local numbers in the area to use this card. These people have a tendency to bend you over when it comes to using the toll free number. I went from having 12 hours to 9 after a week. i finally got the access number and the card is working great now... just a heads up for anyone serving..."
1,Puzzling,I bought this to create crossword puzzles for students to use studying; but this doesn't allow me to easily insert my own words. It's simpler and faster to create personalized puzzles by hand!
4,a fitting end,"if your a john wayne fan the shootist is a fine film, very fitting for his role in film and life.excellant film."
5,SONS OF KATIE ELDER/ THE SHOOTIST,To me the SHOOTIST is one of the best westerns ever made. ABSOLUTELY the best work JOHN WAYNE has ever done.By far so much better than TRUE GRIT.You can see how JOHN WAYNE went from very very GOOD to GREATNESS.ONE OF THE BEST ALL-TIME ACTORS FROM HOLLYWOOD.IF YOU ENJOY JOHN WAYNE YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO SEE THE SHOOTIST '' YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY YOU DID
3,It met my expectatios,"It met my expectations, but was a little over-priced. The quality is good and it serves the purpose , its pretty."
3,"Good, Workable for now.","This trays are the right size for my needs, they are NOT as deep as advertized. It said the trays were an inch deep, but the are more like a half inch deep. This does make a difference when the tray is being placed in a person's lap, while the person is sitting in a chair or bed. They will do for now, but if I find other deeper one. These will be replaced."
5,Book with lots of information,I got this book to learn more about my three legged dog and what her needs might be. The book helped a lot and was packed with lots of useful information..
2,Nice Pictures Only,"A beautiful photographic journey through Zimbabwe, but a miserable account of the authentic Zimbabwe Sculpture Movement that has taken the world by storm in the last few decades. The text is blatantly sensationalized as a tool for selling mass produced curio sculptures from the galleries owned by the authors. They seem to have written a fictional account of Shona history and spirituality solely for the purpose of over-dramatizing the spiritual essence of the stone sculpture movement. Such false representation reeks of greedy marketeering for the sole purpose of personal gain. However, the photographs alone may be worth the cover price, but don't expect much more."
3,Christ's Middle Eastern itinerary,"Page focuses on about 200 sites where Jesus is known to/thought to have ministered, with local color, contemporary local politics, multicultural settings, and subsequent enshrinement of these sites by a host of Christian, Islamic, and Jewish imperialists eager to claim 'holy ground' for their particular faith. Great illustrations and very useful index."
4,Looking for the Historical Jesus,"We are returning to Israel for a second visit in a couple of months and were loaned this book by my pastor. We liked it so much, we are buying a copy to take on our visit as a reference, even though we visited many of the sites during our first visit."
3,One of Ajay's early 90's movies,"HAQEEQAT was a hit too which released in 1995. The film starts off well though the going-ons are predictable yet it is well handled we have romance in Switzerland, lot of comedy, emotions and drama yet it s well handledThere are some good scenes like Amrish Puri coming to know the truth of Ajay after he accidentally praised him for his humanity a minute back Ajay saving children and Tabu knowing the truthThe film does have some bizarre scenes like Ajay saving Tabu from the cage and some moreDirection by Kuku Kohli is good Music is good, DIL NE DIL SE stands outAjay Devgan lends his part the right amount of emotions and vulnerability and conveys through his eyes though he has done such roles many times Tabu too looks nice and does a good job Amrish Puri has done such roles many times but yet he is lovable Himani Shivpuri is okay Johny Lever is funny Rami Reddy, Mohan Joshi are the villains Satyen Kapoo is as usual, Ishrat Ali is okay Aruna Irani is likable"
5,Great Book!,"I'm not an easy person to get along with and I don't like most people (what can I say, I'm easily annoyed). This book made a lot of sense and I've started to be able to get along better with others. Sometimes you just gotta learn to go with the flow."
2,Making Friends,"This book was used as a text for Speech. I enjoyed his anectdotel stories and fresh approach, but the integrationist approach and defense of self-esteem were unimppressive."
4,School book,"This is a text book my husband needed for a communications class in college. He hasn't begun to study the book yet, but I was impressed by other reviews and hope my 15 year old son, who has Asperger's Syndrome, may get some valuable information out of the book after my husband is done with it."
4,Does the job,Although I ordered a 6v 10.0ah battery they sent me a 6v 12.0ah battery does the job and I'm happy don't really know what the difference is but as long as it works I'm good ! I also mite add this company shipped this extremely fast amd I received ahead of schedule
3,Works fine,These are replacement bags for the scooper. The scooper works OK once you get the hang of it. You have to be pretty fast to get the scooper in place once the dog starts the squat!
4,kwik pic,service good - price too high - would like to know which pet stores carry this item. I believe the product will cost less in the local stores.
2,Not a Big Fan,"I'm not a big fan of these pans. With a name like Kitchen Aid, I'd hope they'd be better. The silicone handle on the front is not snug. I took it off while baking because I was concerned it would simply fall off (it had when held). The pan does not cook evenly and doesn't seem to be non-stick."
5,The Story Of A High School Teacher,The book I read is the Invitations To The World.It's about ths high school teacher learning aout the student and threw the limits of education and danger of comfort and it talks a little of bullying and about votes.He puts a date 9/11 and he says it's a dramatic that need for ridges if geography liked this book was literature.About danger of comformity and censorship about he's a great author and i give 5 stars to him because i really like this book.My opion is that most of tis stuff i agree because it makes alot of sence about this stuff that he's talking about.Richard Peck gives alot of what he means alot.He was the only the adult in the room hope his best of luck hope he writes another book soon.
4,This IS the best!,"Preliminary reviews for this collection say viewers should just buy the two seasons of the show. I agree. But pound for pound, minute for minute, the highlights of this show beat out 95 percent of any year's crop of film or TV comedies. This is two-and-a-half hours of inappropriate race-obsessed laughter. It can occupy the same spot asLate Night with Conan O'Brien - The Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dogas the perfect crack-em-up closer to any party. This is the guaranteed laugh you need when nothing else will do. Skit-based comedy is perfect for repurposing, as ""Saturday Night Live"" has discovered, and there's no reason there shouldn't be a best-of for ""Chappelle's Show"" to serve the same function.Best of all: ""Chappelle's Show"" wipes the street with the best of ""SNL."""
4,"Funny, Hits real issues but presented in a comedy","Dave Chapelle is a natural funny person, who also addresses real issues but in his language (comedy). His sketches hilarious and i would recommend him and all his standup releases if you're the type that enjoys (open-type) comedy and are not easily offended."
5,The Best,"Everytime I saw Chappelle`s, was a humor explosion; you can test the humor and tje irony, realy is te The Best."
1,REALLY NECESSARY?,"I give this one star because the package is not necessary. The show only had 2 seasons on comedy central. Then they came out with the ""lost episodes"" which where only like 3 episodes. Everyone has already bought the season sets so why make a best of. Yes I understand that people who have never bought the seasons at all would like this items at it's reasonable price $15, but this is just another way to make money off of people. Buy the season sets of you want the ""best of"" because they were all good."
5,I should keep this a secret: this is the best book on the subject I've seen yet.,"Randy Gage has given me true wisdom about the MLM industry through this book. This goes beyond being a simple 'how-to' book which I usually find on the topic of MLM. Randy shares his format for creating duplication, presentations, and moving prospective partners into the business and into becoming self sufficient team creators.This book has become my guidebook moving forward and I find myself referring to it everyday. If you want to find out what the big business builders know and tools they use to grow - this is the book."
4,Randy Gage is truly one of the top trainers in network marketing today,"""The Getting Started Fast"" chapter is a must read, before a new enrollee loses their fire, jump start with this fabulous training. Also, the ""Building Depth"" chapter is essential in developing future leaders of your organization. Randy could be nicknamed the ""godfather"" of network marketing."
2,Majorly Outdated...Back to the Rah-Rah Amway Method!,"This book is outdated. It says nothing about the Internet; probably because the Internet wasn't around when Randy wrote this book.The techniques are the same as what you would get from the old Amway meethings about hosting meetings and seminars, getting people all pumped up, and cross your fingers, hoping they will sell the products or get a downline.The methods in this book are old fashioned and too outdated to make work in this day and age."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH MLM!,"People today want to spend time with their families, watch TV and enjoy life. They do NOT want to be bothered by being recruited into some pyramid scheme. After they find out what MLM is REALLY about, you'll end up losing your friends. Choose a way to make money that leaves people alone. The only reason MLM is still legal is because not enough disgruntled people have complained to the FTC, but this will soon change."
5,The Best Book on Network Marketing.Period.,"If you want to know how to build a long term, duplicatable networking business, then this book is for you. All I can say is that I endorse few books, but this one gets my vote as a ""must have""! Al Perhacs-Business Director, Handtech.com"
4,A pleasant and engaging family memoir,"Holroyd, a biographer, turns his skills as a researcher and writer onto his own family, and proves that the devil really is in the details, and in the telling of the same. The display of his skills as a writer in dealing with the homely eccentricities and dusty skeletons in the closet of his own life have convinced me that I must, at the very least, acquire and read his work on Bernard Shaw. Definitely recommended."
2,this isn't complete,"This version of this is 52 minutes instead of 98 minutes as it was first run. Unless you have read the book, you will have no idea what is going on."
3,Disappointing,"A wonderful series, but a very poor quality transfer to DVD. The picture is grainy and rapid movement on screen is jerky."
1,Pass On This,"This series is flat-out horrible. Some of the actors appear to be very good but there is absolutely no chemistry between them. Most of the rest are terrible. The screenplays are weak and don't compel one to read the books.All in all, the series teeters on the edge of genuine melodrama. If you are looking into this series and haven't seen Foyles War, I'd suggest skipping this and buying Foyle.After watching this first set, I won't be buying the second."
1,english mysteries,Having watched the Foyle's War and Inspector Lynley series this just does not stack up. It is just terrible!! Don't spend your money on it!
5,Great Savings,This pulley is the same as sold at name brand auto retailers but the savings is almost 50% over the retailers price. Gates is a very reliable name brand bearing provider and I was looking for this specific item. I installed it on my 2000 Oldsmobile Intrigue and have had no problems with this pulley. I always compare on Amazon for better deals after I research at the local retail stores.
5,Refined and beautiful,"Thomas Allen was in his considerable prime when he recorded this disc twenty years ago and it is now one of the bargains in the catalogue. His voice was always light, refined and flexible, capable of a lovely mezza-voce and an intimacy of expression. An occasional dryness and excessive restraint characterises his Lieder singing, especially when contrasted with, say, Bryn Terfel's richer vocal resouces and more extrovert interpretation but he does not lack intensity or power when they are required. Refreshingly, he is more prepared to sing softly than almost any other comparable artist I know. His German is excellent and he has the best accompanist of his generation in Roger Vignoles, whose phrasing, variety and sensitivity are beyond reproach. I still prefer a fine tenor in ""Dichterliebe"", hence my continued attachment to Fritz Wunderlich's famous account, but it cannot be denied that Allen brings more feeling to his inflection of the text."
5,What a fast paced read!!,"I love Stephen Leather's style and this book did not dissapoint. It could so easily be turned into an Oscar winning movie. It was fast paced, exciting, sad, and I felt a bit like i'd lost a friend when the book ended."
5,Good book,I like all the stephen leather books and this was just as thrilling as his others. I would buy his books again.
5,UNPUTDOWNABLE,"If you like edge of your seat suspense, this will do it. Most of LEATHER's books reek of authenticity and this is no exception.The plot powers ahead at breakneck speed and you will spent your time in the company of a very believable character doing unbelievable things to people who deserve it. On of the fastes reads ever for me and it lead to the rest of LEATHER's books which gave me hours of unadulterated pleasure."
5,Exciting and Educational Show,"This 6-episode disc is filled with the intense action of a good movie. Spec Ops man Wil Willis (Whiskey Whiskey) is given a mission against 4 opposing enemies. During the course of his mission, there's almost always something the changes the game -- like a hostage being taken or intel discovering WMDs on site that need to be destroyed.Each episode is really a military training exercise conducted by very experienced and able soldiers. But as you're given insight into how Wil Willis operates, you'll quickly discover that the four soldiers are a few men short of a fair fight.You'll learn how the ""instincts"" inscribed during training can save a Spec Ops man. And you'll learn that there's no magic to their operation. They move in and out like ghosts to the enemy. But to the operator, they slowly belly crawl through thick brush in order to hit and run without being seen.If you enjoy military special operations, you'll love this show."
5,Special Op Mission,"I saw Special Ops Mission when it was on the Military Channel a couple of years ago. I actualy have it on my DVR too, but wanted the DVDs. I like the DVDs as the commercials are cut out. I was hoping they would show more content or extras that the regular series didn't, but there was nothing extra. That's ok, its a great show, very entertaining and fun to watch. I shared it with my 18 year old son, and he enjoyed it too. For the price it is great entertainment."
4,i like it,"i use to love this show on tv, but like a comment on here from someone else- it's all staged, the cameraman would be a giveaway as where everyone would be at. i still like it though i learned 1 or 2 things from it."
3,Different from her Josie Bates series,"I read all four of the Josie Bates books and really enjoyed them. However, this book is not part of the series, and the writing level and style seemed almost to be by a different writer. I do not like or read romance novels, so that was the main problem. The other problem is that the story does not flow smoothly. I will continue to look forward to the next in the Josie Bates series (hopefully there will be a #5!), though."
1,None,I could completely understand the moral dilemma facing this attorney but the rest of the book was completely unbelievable. Spoiler alert...She thought he was trying to make her bleed to death but didnt get stitches until the next day. She didnt call the police when someone cut off her horses tail. Come on.
3,Keeping counsel,Book was good although after reading the witness series a little disappointing. Definitely no comparison. Looking forward to reading some other more current works by Rebecca Forster.
3,Slow.............,"This book is very slow and just when you reach the final climax, it lets you down. I believe there were a couple of ways this book could have ended, but I never expected it to end as it did (and I don't mean that it was good). I have read other books from this author and enjoyed them however the story just doesn't really grab you...I kept reading to see how it would end and waiting for that moment when I couldn't put the book but it never happened."
3,Keeping Cousel by Rebecca Forster,I chose 3 stars because it was good not great. It did keep me wanting to know what was coming next.My dislike the story seemed repitious to me. She made Tara think only of her self didnt care who she hurt. I didnt like her charater.I would recomened but tell who every that it was good not great. The book did keep me interested to see what is coming next.
2,LOVED HER OTHER BOOKS!,IV'E READ MOST ALL OF HER BOOKS AND LOVED THEM. THIS STARTED OUT GOOD BUT IT'S CONCLUSION WAS DISAPPOINTING AND UNBELIEVABLE!
5,"Nice, stable RAM.",I have purchased 2 sets of these. For some reason Windows XP only sees 3GB instead of 4GB. I heard it's an OS issue so I'll be switching to 64-bit Vista soon.This is very nice RAM.. it is stable and comparatively does not get very hot. If you're a gamer or a designer with a 64-bit XP or Vista.. you'll want 2 of these 2GB sets. It's worth the value.
3,title,"it works, i dont really recommend it though because even though its 1 gb each, with 4 of them u only get 3.25 and its not that fast."
2,Go Tell The Spartans this movie is garbage.,"I shouldn't have to go any further than Marc Singer and Craig Wasson, that ought to tell you something right there.WORST Vietnam movie ever made. Period. I dont know what these morons with 4/5 star reviews are smoking. This thing is horrible, and made worse by one of Hollywood's most revered actors, Burt Lancaster, using language and saying things that are waaaaay out of character and that you have never heard him say before. Not to mention he's far to old for the role as a field commander at age 65!!!!!This movie is bad, there is no way you can pretty it up and wrap roses around it, its acrap production. 2 bullets, and I'm being kind."
4,"Good viet-nam movie, good performance by lancaster & singer","this movie was more realistic, than other movies about viet-nam from this time period, like ""boys in company C"". similar in some ways to ""84 charlie mo-pic"" in that it has no happy ending. Good performances by lancaster (as a cynical colonel) and marc singer plays a ambitious captain, hoping the war doesn't end before he gets promoted. if you're into viet-nam this is one for your collection."
3,"A good premise for a movie, but poor execution","""Go Tell the Spartans"" is important in the genre of Vietnam war films primarily because, unlike Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, it looks at the earliest phase of American military involvement in Vietnam. The production values of the film suffer from its low budget (supposedly Burt Lancaster kicked-in his own money to get it made) and third-rate actors. It has the feel of a made-for-TV movie from the 70's. I think that the story would be a good subject for a higher-quality remake. I'm not sure why, but I still like the movie, although I think of it as a very rough cut of what the film could have been."
2,Low budget good movie,"The story, and acting are great but it is so low budget it is hard to watch. Vietnamese looked like they just walked off the disco floor with perfect styled 70s hair. the sets are cheap and it looked like it was filmed in a back lot. Drive the 100 miles in to Mexico and film in a real jungle. The icould have been a classic but too many corners were cut."
2,go tell the spartans,"The movie was everthing I hoped it would be. But the quality of the video was a little disappointing.At about mid way it would stop for(sometimes a couple of minutes) a length of time then would start again only choppy, After a bit it statred working fine.I tried this a couple of times and it always did the same at the same point in the movie."
2,Go Tell the Spartans,"This is a B class movie set in Vietnam in the early 1960's. The soldiers are MAAG Advisors, the vietnamese troops are ruff-puffs. It is technically correct in terms of uniforms, weapons, etc. and is probably Burt Lancaster's sunset appearance. Veteran's who were in Vietnam during that era will appreciate the technical aspects of the film but will not be impressed with the weak storyline, even if it is true."
3,Not Bad,"I believe this was the first Vietnam War movie...it hits the target well, one side fighting an all out war while the other side ( America) fighting a limited war."
2,Not Good At All,"I wasn't impressed. Poor production quality,the actors didn't look like they were in the military, an awful picture. I'm glad I bought a used copy so it didn't cost too much."
1,Unrealistic Waste,"I wasted good money on what I had read was a ""good film"". This is befitting of something that panders to stereotypes of the Vietnam war. The mid-1970s long haircuts, WWII vehicles, and over-acting detracted from what might have been a good film. If they had gotten a real soldier as a technical advisor for the film making, they could have avoided making it a cheap version of MASH. Sorry, the film is not instructive, does not realistically portray the Army of 1964 and is not very entertaining. As a Vietnam-era infantry veteran I give this film two-thumbs down."
2,"MASH with Blue Language and no Laughs, Good Writing nor Acting.","As soon as the movie started, I thought it was of those cheap made for TV movies that were cranked out in the 70's. Well it was not made for TV, but it certainly was cheap. I think the whole movie budget had to go to Lancaster, who by the way was given some the corniest, cheeseball lines in his career.Battle scenes are sparse and look really cheap when they do occur. Not only are Lancaster's lines bad, the rest of the cast has nothing to work with either. Most lines are over acted and there is one character that is SO bad he was funny.On a postive note, I think is does show how screwed up aspects of the were executed, bit overall, I would like to have that 114 minutes of my life back...Bad, Bad, Bad..."
5,An over-looked Vietnam war classic film,"Released in the same year as other Vietnam films such as ""Coming Home"" and ""The Deer Hunter"", this fine low-budget film was ignored by the Academy in favor of the other two yet it boasts one of Burt Lancaster best latter day performances and the other two leads, Craig Wasson and Marc Singer, are also excellent as well. In fact Lancaster was so fond of the brilliant script/story that he donated $150,000 out of his pocket to complete the film. In print, Lancaster stated that he considered ""Airport"" a pile of crap but he was paid so well for it that he could afford to play a role such as Maj Asa Baker, a war weary veteran of previous wars. Along with his other great roles such as ""Atlantic City"" and ""The Leopard"", this one ranks as one of his best and the direction by Ted Post (Hang Em High;Magnum Force) is focused and efficient. Recommended for anyone interested in the whole Vietnam dilemna and war enthusiasts."
2,Old movie,"Recommended to me, I was not all that impressed. There are much better Vietnam movies out there. I really expected more action."
4,Early Viet Nam,"I enjoyed this movie. I had seen it years ago and liked it then. It isn't an elaborate Hollywood production and looks more like a made for TV movie. However, it does a nice job showing the problems faced by the US military in Viet Nam right from the early days of just being advisors to the South Viet Nam Army. It was a mess then and became a huge mess later. If you watch this film with an open mind and disregard the low budget production then you will probably enjoy this movie. If you are looking for an Apocalypse Now, Platoon, or Full Metal Jacket type production you will be very disappointed."
3,"Good acting, good story but production values poor","I was prepared to like this movie a lot: I am a Burt Lancaster fan and I served in Vietnam as an advisor. But I was disappointed because the overall poor quality of the sets, the cliched depiction of most of the characters, and the lack of realism combined to make it just an average movie. But it told a truer story than most of the bilge that attempt to pass themselves off as ""truth"", such as Platoon or Apocalypse Now."
2,Preachy self-promotion,"The author uses the guise of having a conversation with his dog to preach his views on life, character and morals to the listener. The idea that these are ""conversations with his dog"" is ridiculous. Several times in the book, the author shamelessly promotes his other books, etc. I found that tacky. The whole concept for the book just doesn't work in this case."
1,didn't do it for me,"in my opinion this book has the wrong title and concept.....from reading the title, i got psyched up for a nice warming story about a dog and his/her owner....there is no ""doginess"" in this book at all....perhaps the title should've been something like: ""The venting of Ziglar"" or ""The Zig Zag in Zig's Mind""i do not recommend this book"
1,A Dissappointing Read,"This book caught my eye because I own and grew up with Pembroke Welch Corgis. I had not read any other books by Zig Ziglar but had heard of him. At first I found the material somewhat simplistic like someone is reading a book for children and the chapters hold this old fashioned ""father knows best"" advice that is outdated and old news. I was espcially offended by a chaper in which he explains to his dog how it was ok for his wife to ""spank"" him. He states "". . . I believe that when kids misbehave, mild corporal punishment is a good approach to take."" Then he quotes the bible to back this up. I can't believe he is using this dog in this way, he is not an authority on dogs and it is never effective or ok to hit a dog. The book also had alot of references to religion and the bible. I wished I would have known what was in this book, I would have save my money by not buying it. It was a very disappointing book."
5,Blah Blah Blah !,"This CD Single contains 2 Album Tracks ( Shut Up , Too Much Of You ) a Karaoke Track of Shut Up (Instrumental Version with Backup Vocals)and the disc itself is enhanced so if you pop the disc into the computer , you can watch the Music Video Of Shut Up . Shut Up is a pretty Punky track . You can really hear Kelly's strong voice in this . Too Much of you seems like a pop song . It reminds me of M2M for some odd reason .In My Opinion , the UK version is way better than it's U.S. and Australian releases since this very rare version has the Karaoke Track and the Music Video . If you're lucky enough to come across a copy of this single , you'd better grab it before its too late ."
1,A stirring plea by French Liberals for the Extermination of the American people,"A FEW DAYS IN SEPTEMBER. (2007) Starring Juliette Binoche, Nick Nolte and John Turturro.This...admitedly well made ....film is the French version of September 11, 2001 with Desert Storm tossed in to boot. To wit the Bush administration was behind it all so as to provide a pretext to invade Iraq so as to get Saddam Hussein. The Muslim world is shown as not having a clue let alone any involvement. We are also treated to a roughly ten minute screed by a young French woman on why Americans are not really human and will be wiped off the face of the Earth in 30 years tops. The sole American presented as not being sleazy or an insane killer haplessly agrees.Did I mention that the film is French??"
1,waste of cinematography,"This year especially, I got what I thought were good gems of movies, with good actors, plot and shooting. But, what I ended up with were duds. This one is one of those.Once you start watching the movie, you know exactly what is going to happen, but have to go through the torture of getting there.. not that much happens. There is tension created out of thin air, there is somewhat of a plot line, and all the good acting is wasted on a total that is not there. It is as if the French create these movies to mock the Americans.Also, there are no subtitles in English part of the dialogue, so if you are hard of hearing, tough luck!I would consider this movie to be a ""poser"", nothing more, especially on a subject as significant as 9/11.What a waste.."
1,"Ridiculous, weak, slow plot = Ridiculous, weak, slow movie","One of John Turturro's worst performances, if not the worst. Babbling in French like some ethereal thinking, Homer Simpson was laughable. And he was supposed to be an assassin? Whatever her name was, as the lead came across as an incompetent ""agent"" of whatever she was tasked to do. A brother and sister frolicking and having sex. What a waste of time.Dumb European production trying to copy a premise (if that's what you want to call it) more suited as a big budget American film, failed. Nick Nolte's appearance made things even more laughable and unbearable. Goofy movie.I don't care if this review helps no one. Just wanted to get across how much a stinker of a movie this is."
3,Very Forgettable!!,"I usually like Juliette Binoche in most all her roles and who wouldnt want to see a movie with John Turturro and Nick Nolte....Right?, but...This movie is very slow and in French (just letting you know). I watched the first hour and couldnt bear the thought of sitting through another hour.Pass this movie up when you see it! Not recommended!!!!!"
5,Love it,"Got it as a gift for my wife - she loves it. Real easy to put on and take off with the nice easy-to-use and adjustable clasp system, but very secure. Very thin and light, wouldn't feel like it's even on. Overall, another nice product from Skagen."
3,Watch band too big,"The watch arrived quickly, and was exactly what we were looking for and for a terrific price. We were dissapointed when we could not adjust the watch band to fit tight enough, and had to send it back. If you order this watch and have thin wrists, you might need to be prepared for it to be too big."
4,Risky Birthday Gift for my Wife,"I received a Skagen watch with a mesh band from my wife for my birthday and I just love it! So, when her birthday came along it seemed like a no-brainer. She's a bit more stylish than I, so I searched back and forth through the Skagen line for quite a while to settle on this mesh-banded beauty. The Skagens reflect a very cool Danish design aesthetic: super-thin, simple, comfortable, reasonably-priced, and stylish. The Women's Crystal kicks the style up a couple notches. The black is dressier and the crystals add a nice bit of sparkle. Though you can't see it well in the photos, the face has a kind of deep gray opalescence, as if it were made of a dark abalone. It has subtle shimmering depth like a dark pool of water. Needless to say, she loved, and loves, it and gets compliments all the time."
4,It showns that we all have a dark side,"It interesting to see how the critics of Mr. Chomsky might my call him by several nasty names, but fail to present evidence to contradict its presentation of the facts about why USA and Israel are among the largest terrorist actors in the world responsible of merciless and cinical killings of thousands of civilians.Suprinsigly he does not accomodate the definition of what is a terrorist or a terrorist act to fit its conclusions. He gets there using the definition coinded by the US government.That is why the reaction of his critics is so emotional, nobody likes it what its dark side is exposed.By the way he does not argue that the guys on the other side are the good ones, he simply points out how sad it is that neither USA, Israel can claim to be innocent victims of terrorism when a maniac blows himself and several bystanders in a burger joint or takes down a bulding with a plane."
4,Half Price at Nest Entertainment!!,Right now you can get the WHOLE series (all 11 DVDs) for only 9.99 each....I am surprised that Amazon is more expensive since usually I look to amazon to beat most prices....
4,Informative,"I bought three of the series. They have loads of info I have not come across before, but the people are a bit redundant with dialogue."
5,Really good!,"For me, this DVD wasn't as detailed as their Art of Canning DVD but it's still 5 star worthy because it's the best that I have found. The West ladies teach you all the techniques on making homemade bread, hamburger rolls, cinnamon rolls, pizza dough, a breakfast dish and cornbread.Side note:I did have a problem with trying to view this DVD on my computer but it works fine in the regular DVD player."
5,Man's Inhumanity to Man Overcome,"Great book. The part that blew me away was not God's redemption of Robert from hatred and abuse (that is amazing and there are millions of people who can attest to God's saving power). The really big story for me was that there was still institutionalized slavery in the early 1900's. This is one man's story of his enslavement and emancipation, physically, emotionally, and spiritually."
4,Muy Bien,"Imagine if the ghost of the female doppelganger of Modest Mouse's Issac Brock sang in a band influenced by Modest Mouse, Pavement, and Explosions in the Sky, but they produced a dance-pop shoegaze album. Get it."
3,Long sleeve t-shirt review,"Marginal quality t-shirt. Just ""OK"". T-shirt is not very heavy material and I didn't really like the cut of the neck because it's too big."
1,Yawn! Could be better.,"This DVD has bloopers... and some are funny, but there is more crap that only the cast would enjoy, clips of stuff that is not ""blooper"" --- and MANY of it repeats over and over... this was not put together with love at all- just a mish mash of mish mash. Not worth it."
4,Blast from the past...,"Outtakes and Bloopers from 1960's & 1970's TV shows. Some are Black & White, some are in color. The quality isn't great, but it's a blast from the past if you enjoyed the classic TV shows, such as MASH, Star Trek, Happy Days, Laugh-In, and others. Contains material that may not be suitable for children. Runtime is 112 minutes."
5,Excellent twenties band!!,"Roger Kahn was the son of wealthy banker Otto Kahn. He loved dance music and got his father to pay for excellent musicians, great arrangers, endless rehearsals, superior recording facilities. Boy, am I glad he did! This is definitely an album to add to your collection if you love this type of music. Roger Kahn also wrote the highly addictive song, ""Crazy Rhythm."" This is definitely worth loading into your ipod!!!!"
5,great book for beginners,"this is a great book for beginners. the authors have quite a nice sense of humor and that makes this book fun. The illustrations include both PC and Mac examples. The CD-ROM not only includes the exact examples from the book, but various .mov files that you can watch if you are more of a visual learner.this is a fantastic book if you've never used dreamweaver, and a great resource for those that just need a quick reference!"
2,Obsolesence revisited,"Potential buyers be warned: Dreamweaver MX is obsolete, so the training copy included on the CD is just that--a trial/training copy. It cannot be purchased, nor registered, nor updated (on a Macintosh; the work-around does not affect a trial copy). So all the instruction is effective as a general introduction to Dreamweaver, but useless for the purpose of actually posting a website. If you have a paid copy of MX, well-enough. I find the book technically rather than creatively oriented, but then cold fusion seems to be the general mood, while H.O.T. strikes me as a cute advertising gimmick. Onward to Dreamweaver MX 2004."
2,pretty useless...,"you can fly through this giant book, but when you're done with it's 600some pages you have no idea how to start making your first website. it generally explains/introduces all the different functions in dreamweaver mx. you'd be much better off doing the DW tutorials included with the program."
1,not for beginners or mac users,"This may be the best book on the topic but that doesn't mean it's any good. It's oriented heavily toward PC users and a lot of the text, illustrations, and CD files will be largely frustrating to useless to Mac users and to beginners with Macromedia. This stuff may be hard to teach, but I can't believe it has to be this confusing."
3,Dreamweaver MX Hands-On Training,"I would love to gush over this book and give it a five star rating, but I cannot. Before I purchased this book I had zero knowledge of Dreamweaver MX. Using this book and the included files on the CD-ROM I successfully created a website using Dreamweaver MX. I followed the lessons and used the files and I created a website. My problem is that even though I now have a slight understanding of the program, building my own site is still a slight mystery. When the book told me to open a file, or import a graphic I did. What I don't know how to do is prepare my own graphics and files to import into my own site. That is most probably outside the scope of this book, so my rating may be a little unfair. A page near the front saying, ""If you are a complete beginner you will also need...."" whatever they used to prepare their graphics. Otherwise the book is very well written and easy to follow. I highly recommend Lynda.com books and training CDs."
3,Mostly covers domain planning in my opinion.,"The title of the book is Planning for Windows 2000 and that's partially true, except it mostly talks about the domain structures and DNS. Not too much info about Windows 2000 Server and Workstation and what you'll have to do differently than NT."
5,Picture doesn't do it justice!,It's a gorgeous watch but description doesn't even mention that it has 12 genuine diamonds on it. They are uniquely displayed on it as well.
2,Punching peaches,"Little else than rambling, third-rate Pumpkins-esque psychedelia, rarely coming together in potent enough measures to even emulate that low standard."
1,Bristles Fall Apart with a Few Uses,"These are such a disappointment. The bristles fall apart in my mouth within the first uses, sometimes the very first use."
2,Preserve ultra soft bristles.,"I was looking for bulk toothbrushes on Amazon.com and found the Preserve Toothbrushes, Ultra Soft Bristles. Immediately I noticed two things: 1) they felt great on my gums! 2) On the other hand, they did not clean my teeth well, especially between them. However, since they are echo-friendly, i will try the medium strength bristles, and if they do not work, I will be forced back to the Oral-B kind.In summary:Pros:1) Echo friendly product.2) They are soft on gums.3) Product comes with a pre-paid envelope for recycling.Cons:1) Do not clean between teeth.2) You have to replace them every two weeks or so, depending on use, as they tarnish quickly.3) Handles are not comfortable on the hands."
5,Preserve Ultra Soft Toothbrushes,"If you have sensitive teeth or gums, this is the perfect toothbrush for you! I searched for years before I found this eco-friendly, smartly angled brush with delicate bristles that won't irritate my recessed gums. My teeth are actually cleaner now because it doesn't hurt to brush them with this ultrasoft toothbrush. However, make sure you buy the Preserve Ultrasoft toothbrush as the Preserve Soft toothbrush is surprisingly much harsher on sensitive gums and teeth."
1,Not worth the price,I bought these because they said that they were ultra soft and they were a very good price. They are not ultra soft.
2,Not great,"These aren't the best ultra-soft bristled toothbrushes going. (I have to use ultra-soft bristled toothbrushes.) There was another brand I used to get (at shops, not online) that was called Sensodyne, I think, and they were much better. I can't seem to find those ones online anywhere, so I tried these Preserve ones, and they are ok, but they go bad quite quickly -- they just don't last. So, yeah. Not one of my favorite Amazon purchases. I mean, they're fine, and they do the job, but I prefer the other brand."
1,mouthful of bristles,"These toothbrushes are terrible. Everytime I brush, at least 1 or 2 bristles come loose. Really a gross feeling.They don't last long either."
4,They're Toothbrushes,"I get these for my whole family. They're soft enough not to do damage even with vigorous brushing, yet they get our teeth clean. The fact that they're recycled is a huge plus for me."
5,Great extra-soft toothbrush,"The Oral-B extra soft was sold out at Target and the only other adult extra soft toothbrush was the Preserve.The shape is whacky and not exactly helpful. But the bristles really are extra-soft and don't ""harden with time"", as some others have mentioned happen with some brands. Postage-paid sleeve means I don't have to toss it. All around good buy."
3,"One day a yogurt cup, the next day a toothbrush","On the packaging, it says ""one day a yogurt cup, the next day a toothbrush"". I found it appealing that this was a recycled product so that nothing would be going to waste. This is a toothbrush you can feel good about using.My teeth are kind of sensitive, so I bought the ultra-soft bristles hoping they'd be gentle on my teeth. They are gentle, however, I'm concerned now that my teeth aren't getting clean enough. The bristles are perhaps too soft, the kind of softness that you see on expired toothbrushes that need to be tossed out. Next time, I'll try just the regular soft bristles and see how that goes."
1,Not worth the money,Very basic and not that life-like. Purchased this one because I thought it would be more educational and sturdier. Definitely not worth the money. I was very disappointed.
3,It looks like much more in the picture,"I agree with the other reviewer about making this at home. It is cute, and I am sure my daughter will appreciate it, but what a lot of money for not very much. It is also a very small tin - about 7 inches by 4 inches, with really just a few things in it. I bought it because it is not plastic. I wanted some quality - well I got it, but I definitely did not get quantity. It is really a measly little thing."
1,"I really, really wanted to like this kit....","I love HABA toys and own many. Personally I find this kit to be adorable and was excited to see an alternative to the plastic toys which are generally less attractive (not to mention the health concern of plastic). Unfortunately the lack of durability in this product has led me to only give it one star. Within a week of fairly normal children's play all three of ours were broken in some fashion or another.The kids did enjoy them while they were together, but they too quickly ended up in the trash for what should have been a quality toy."
3,Not Durable and Way Too Small!,"I believe for the price of this toy its a complete rip off! I agree with the other reviewers about making this at home - save your money and do it yourself. The pieces are all Really small, and we already lost a few! Take the ""not suitable for under 3"" on this product seriously as there are a lot of choking hazards and small pieces in the kit. Basically, I'm going to put this in storage for a few more years until my girls are old enough to actually play with this..."
1,Extremely unorganized,There are many books around that are much better.Trail Guide to the body is the best IMNSHO...
5,Extremely User Friendly,I worked at a very busy herb shop in the Bay Area for over 15 years and this book was a god send.So many people are interested in using Chinese medicines and have no idea where to start. This book is a golden doorway. It is also excellent for knowledgeable people and practioners as it is designed and laid out in a very user friendly way. I think it is the BEST book available for learning the whole story of which medicines to use and why.
3,You get what you pay for...,"Not a bad boot for the money, but definitely light duty and probably won't last.For the price though, it's hard to complain."
5,Bizarre Betty at her best!,"These cartoons have to be seen to be believed! Bimbo's Initiation, Is My Palm Red and Betty Boop M.D. are the weirdest things you'll see without breaking any laws.What must have been in the air at the Fleischer Studios in the early Thirties is anyone's guess. Brilliant stuff that anyone from a casual fan to a student of animation has to see - not just amoung the classic cartoons but amoung the classic films of all time!Also, the masters used for this series are beautiful, with the only downside being the lose of the Paramount logo on most of them. You will not find better quality B/W cartoons even from Disney."
3,Past Their Heyday,"Except for A&C Meet Frankenstein, this group is limp by comparison to their earlier work from the 1940s. The films are still okay to watch. If you hadn't seen A&C Go to Mars, the following is a SPOILER, so stop reading here. I hadn't seen Mars since I was 12 and always felt the end was cruel when Costello kisses the innocent girl (Jackie Loughery) and the queen's curse ages her to 100. In my recent viewing I realized at the end that the Queen lifts the effects of the curse which, I assume, means the girl returned to her youthful beauty. Great to see Bruce Cabot in Lost in Alaska. I guess my problem with this group is that I can see the potential of each film if Universal really got behind the projects. Apparently they just relied on Bud and Lou's reputation to sell these movies which is unfortunate."
5,excellent service.,"this dvd set is of excellent quality and thoroughly enjoyable.i was amazed at the quality of the prints of all films. if you are a fan of a,b you will absolutely enjoy."
3,Disc one and three were great but........,"the flip side of the disc didn't play so well, there were a lot of frames that the movie stopped for a very long time. Maybe 4 film collections or 8 films on 4 discs might be a better way to go. My favorite is when they meet Frankenstein. It has everything-moving candles, secret rooms, Dracula, the Wolfman & at the end, the Invisable Man, who you can see more of on the next disc, and if you order it, you get it really fast."
5,This DVD collection is a must - for any A&C Fans,I remember growing up watching old Abbott and Costello movies on Sunday afternoons with my Dad (along with the classic monster movies and the old Blondie shows). Buying these DVD's is like reliving great memories from my youth. The picture quality on these DVD's is outstanding - they are very well done. This third volume in this series is going to be the best of them all - this DVD will have some of my all time favorite A&C movies. I have watched the first two volumes numerous times since purchasing them and look forward to this next volume with great anticipation.
4,Abbott and Costello Back In Action Once Again!,"Sure many will criticize that this volume like the previous two don't have all the best movies but if you bought the previous two then you know it's not about their movies but their talent. On a second note BEWARE TO BUYERS.... many of the DVD's are damaged. I bought mine at B*** Buy and since have had to return them over six times because the bottom of disc a and b (actually side 2) have had this weird ""cirlce like film"" ingrained in the disks. So make sure to look at the disks carefully AFTER you buy them and if needed return for an exchange other than that- enjoy! ""PING!!!!!!"""
3,COULD HAVE BEEN 5 STARS EXCEPT FOR THE TINY DISC LABELLING.,I love the fun content of these DVDs.Abbott & Costello meet Frankenstein is a classic of laughs from start to finish.What I hate about the DVDs is the labelling of the titles on each DVD only around the hole of each disc. You need a magnifying glass to read what is on each disc.What is great content is poorly presented for ease of use. Why did they do that?
2,More quality issues from Universal,"Is there any DVD manufacturer that continues to put out more shoddy product than Universal.My Volume 1 had to be returned because of a bad DVD. I lucked out on Volume 2, as it played all the way through. But, lo and behold, Volume 3 was faulty too, and had to be returned. I haven't made it all the way through this second set, and hope this one is not defective. But just how does Universal continue to release product that is defective????"
2,Defective DVD,"I purchased all the 3 volumes and so far on the 3rd vol. set, the movie, ""Comin Around The Mountain"" froze on me on the first ten minutes - 15 minutes of the movie and shut down my dvd player. The DVD was not scratched or dirty. I don't know what it was but only that it was defective."
3,Great Movies - Bad Disc,"My husband and I love Abbott and Costello and this was a gift to him for Christmas. The first movie we watched - Frankenstein - was great. Images were fantastic. But we were not able to access a few of the movies at all from the menu - and some of the other movies had drop-out. So great movies, but the discs have manufacturing flaws. We returned the first one for a second disc, and it had the same problems (same movies could not be accessed). So, check all the movies when you get it to be sure you don't have a bad product."
4,Abbott and Costello: Volume 3,I have loved Abbott and Costello since I was a little girl even though they were through making movies by then. So I really enjoyed this DVD of eight of their movies very much. I think I prefer volume 2 a little better but I still watch one of their movies every day. They are very up-lifting and clean.
5,Abbott and Costello are the best,Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is my favorite movie of theirs - I recommend all four of the best of series - Funny movies for almost all ages
5,"Best of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello: Volume 4 on October 4th, 2005!","I was amazed that Universal was releasing Best of Abbott and Costello volume 4; so I went to homevideo.universalstudios.com and saw that there were only a few films on the 2-disc digipack dvd. I hope this list isn't final!DISC 1 Abbott and Costello Meet Dr. Jekyll and Mr. HydeDISC 1 Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone KopsDISC 1 Abbott and Costello Meet the MummyDISC 2 The World of Abbott and CostelloDISC 2 Abbott and Costello Meet Jerry SeinfieldBonus Materials: Abbott and Costello Meet the MonstersI'm assuming they've got more films to put on there, but until then I can't wait until it's available to preorder from amazon."
2,Universal Needs To Get a Clue!,"I purchased Vol. 3 of The Best of Abbott & Costello and also found Disc One, Side Two defective. Specifically the film ""Mexican Hayride"" doesn't seem to be there! It won't play at all. I tried 5 different DVD players and nada! I returned it to Amazon and got a replacement in 3 days. I put in the disc and the exact same defect was there! ""Mexican Hayride"" does not play. There were also defects in ""Comin' Round the Mountain"" (picture freezing). I agree with reviewer ""Neo Noircat"". Universal's DVDs suck! I've had similar problems with defects on their Monster Legacy Collections. Buyers beware!"
5,Great Product,Have emptied two full barrels and have saved 108 gallons of water in the process. Easy to install with a hacksaw to the downspout. No problems with bugs as the net cover is perfect. Great product.
4,Love it,"I love the rain barrel with one exception - the overflow hose. It is a flimsy plastic that in the places where it is flat, will not allow overflow water to drain. I had to replace it with a piece of rigid hose, and now it works fine."
1,Don't buy for cold climate,I bought one of these last summer and found it to be almost in two pieces this spring. I drained it last fall too and it still cracked in two. Don't buy if you live in an area where it could freeze they do not have their molding process correct.
5,Love my Rain Barrels!,"These are great barrels, sturdy, the style is innocuous. The fittings and clips are a little cheesy, but fixes are very inexpensive hardware store goodies (hose couplings, clamps, etc.), even for the non-handy among us. I used two linked together last year, and found by the middle of the summer, I had to place the 1/3 empty barrels on some paver bricks to keep gravity doing its thing on the hose. Other than that - love the idea of using hundreds of gallons of otherwise wasted water! Just bought a couple more for other corners of my yard. Don't forget those inexpensive, non-toxic mosquito dunks - even though the screens work well keeping out debris, those buggers can still make babies in your barrels."
4,Here's hoping.....,"I did not understand the comments about the weak hose connection -YES, it is pretty poor with a friction fitting and a hose clamp to hold it in place.I used Gorilla Glue in addition - will report back on this after using it for a while.....************ UPDATE - August 21, 2010used Gorilla Glue and it has held together with no problem.....I also used parachute cord to hold the drainage hose on a cup hook - the system provided is a waste.Now, it works like a dream, and provides great service."
4,Achla Model RB-01 Rain Catcher Water Barrel,"These Rain Catcher Barrels won't be installed until the final coat of stucco is applied to the outside of the house. I am looking forward to collecting enough run off rain from my roof to water my plants come late winter, early spring.Were able to save $110.00 in shipping through the Supper Saving Shipping on Amazon.com plus the barrels were $5.00-$10.00 cheaper than in the catalog."
2,"Great concept, but keep looking for a better price.","Rain barrels have been used for centuries. I am glad people are resuming the use of these practical devices.But, c'mon, $135 for a simple low-tech plastic barrel?I KNOW I can find a source for these at under $25."
1,Price is extremely high!,Do a search for rain barrels. This price is very high and there are much better ones out there. Poor quality
4,"Great concept, slightly flawed execution","The design elements are great. But ... the overflow hose comes with a zip-tie to attach it to the barrel. Not sufficient. Replace that with a good hose clamp. Also, the overflow hose itself is a flat piece of flex tube: doesn't open up when it needs to, due to the inner plastic adhering to itself. I will be replacing that, too.The watering hose is not held on very well--make sure you tighten the hose clamp well! It came out while my wife was using it and we had a gushing leak.Other design elements are great: screen, varmint grate, overall conception. We like it and use it with a rain chain."
4,Very pleased,"It works likes its supposed to. However, like in previous reviews, the supplied hoses are low quality. Tie wraps to secure hoses should be replaced with automotive water hose clamps. Those are the two changes I made to my install. I purposely held off on this review to verify a previous review of the barrel splitting in the winter if left empty outside. I took a chance and had no problems with winter. This would be a five star product if it weren't for the supplied hoses/hardware. At the price that they sell this for, the last thing I need to do is improve on it. I will be getting another one of these. Mother nature fills these things up quick here in the NE. And the price of this barrel has gone up $12 since my last order :("
4,recycling made easy,"quick delivery of product and fits snugly against outside surface; nice hose feature works when you prop barrel up on cinder blocks so gravity can do it's thing. Removable screened cover keeps out the gutter dirt. You can't scoop water out like other models; you have to use the hose or roll the barrel over and pour, and it gets heavy quickly."
2,Do NOT buy this if you are planning on using it with Vista,"The mixing console itself is quite nice, fun and easy to use but ONLY if you have Window XP; this DOES NOT WORK ON VISTA. I tried all the tips and tricks listed on various forums to try and get this to install properly on Vista to no avail. It comes down to the sad fact that Behringer hasn't updated their software for Vista and doesn't appear to have any plans of doing so for the BCD2000. One of the most frustrating things about all of this is Amazon's product description for this item:Product FeaturesBEHRINGER USA INC BCD2000 Ultimate DJ-Machine - Play, Mix, Perform & Scratch MP3-, OGG- & WAV-Files just like Vinyl-Records, Compatible with Windows Vista only. <----- Not so much."
3,Not good,"Not all that great, you have to use a power cord, the bcdj software that comes with it sucks cant configure with external sound card.. All around just a headache.. Dont recommend, spend the few extra dollars and get something worth the money.."
1,Nice if you can get one that works,"I've had Two that don't work, and now i have one that worked for 10 min. the stopped the only lite on is the power. Does Anyone have time to play with this trash?"
2,No 64bit support.,Most pre-install OS are 64bit these days & Behringer hasn't updated the drivers in years. No plans to on this model.
5,An excellent book that can change lives - yours and others.,"I highly recommend this book along with The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight. Thom Hartmann has done the world a great service by writing these books. He has taken the time to think, feel, and ""see"" the big picture - who are we? why are we here?, and where are we going in relation to those questions. The answers are not always pleasant ones but they are not new or suprising - they have always been there for us to see. I only hope that I can take his message of hope to heart and to borrow a phrase from another book, become a ""bringer of the light."""
2,Just OK,"The shoe seems solid, like any Stride Rite, but even the regular width is very wide. And it's sized a little big, so order maybe a half-size smaller. We returned the pair we bought because they were just too wide."
3,Fairly Bland,"A marriage gone sour, husband then finds another woman, the Borchardt's divorce, and then the husband is found dead in his 1994 Jefferson, WI. home.Son suspects mother, she fails to show up for police interview. Case stalls; then after 4 months police get a tip that three teenagers were involved. Another testifies she'd tried to recruit him to kill her husband and the teenager kept the drawing of the house Mrs. B. gave him.All were convicted, with Mrs. B. eligible for parole at age 80+."
5,the best and so underrated,"unwound was one of the best bands of the 90's but sadfully overlooked in the era before indie mainstreamness. only saw them twice, the saddest moment was seeing them in London in Spring 98 at The Garage, there was a total of five people there. it was sad, but they were amazing."
4,Jack of all Trades ...,"This is a general book that attempts to cover all types of tennis ailments in about 180 pages. Needless to say, if you have a specific problem you'll find it wanting since it will devote only a few pages to your problem.That said it does do a good job of providing general information and provides excercises to help condition and prevent future injuries. The description of some of the exercises are not too clear and it doesn't really go into specifics on how to do the excercises properly."
4,Useful book many good references,I like the way the injury Handbook is explained and have found the book very good I tended to go to the areas of the book that were relevant to me and did find it handy and will keep it for references in future although of course by following its suggestions Im sure they will be lesser in the future
4,Good Weekend Reading,This is a great book to sit down with on a cold weekend. Just grab a quilt and let yourself be taken to the South where the author writes about his life. Not one of them boring autobiographies but a good story.
4,Sound Military Brass!,"This CD from the Regimental Band of the Coldstream Guards is good quality in terms of sound, in range of items, and in the quality of the playing. The band is well conducted, the items are played at proper tempo, and they cover key themes across the British Isles in terms of national tunes."
1,disappointing fit,the carafe description didn't mention a size other than that it was a 5 cup replacement for a black and decker 5 cup coffee maker - it is too tall to fit - it would seem they have added a plastic guard for the top edge and made it so
5,FANTASTICO POLVO TRASLUCIDO PARA PIEL GRASA,"MARAVILLOSO !!! , QUITA EL EXCESO DE GRASA DE LA PIEL , QUE SE ACUMULA CON EL PASO DE LAS HORAS DURANTE EL DIA, DEJA LA PIEL LISA Y PERFECTA. LOS PRODUCTOS DE ESTEE LAUDER SON MARAVILLOSOS TODOS, LOS RECOMIENDO 100 % , LLEVO MAS DE 10 AÑOS USANDOLOS."
3,"Good, but for school","The book is alright, not something I would have purchased on my own, but I needed it for a college writing class and it was very helpful for that. It shipped in I think 3 days which was really nice because I needed it quick."
1,Just awful dreck,"Does this mean that anyone can call themselves a ""poet"" no matter how awful they are? Shame on Coffee House for putting their money into this when there are true poets out there, with voices of honesty, compassion, and wisdom. This is pretentious drivel, parading as the musings of an ""artiste"" who presents the Midwest and the homeless as something to be snickered at. These are hardly poems-- but run-on sentences plopped together, without any imagery or idea to sustain them, coming at the reader like the sloppy alcoholic musings of a narcisstic. It is infuriating that books like this choke the market, and that trees are killed to make them."
4,Why ruin an excellent book by leaving out an index???,"This is one of the most brilliant compiliations of solid information on the many dimensions of spiritual direction that I have ever seen. As a seminary faculty member who covers direction in a variety of ways both in formation as well as in the training of clergy, I have found the breadth of what is covered is amazing. She clearly articulates the pitfalls and discernment issues that are involved in direction as opposed to pastoral care. Her section on discerning whether or not to pray for healing for a directee is worth the price of the book! The lack of a topic index seems unforgivable in this day and age of publishing and detracts immensely from the usability of the book as the solid reference that it could be."
5,Good resource for understanding and applying spiritual direction.,Good resource for understanding and applying spiritual direction. I appreciate the role-play that goes on throughout the book. There is a broad spectrum of reasons to use spiritual direction.
2,Boring!,"When I started reading historical romances, Johanna Lindsay was one of the first authors that I read. Some of her books on my keepers list are A Gentle Feuding, Fire of Winter, Hearts Aflame. But Glorious Angel is one of her worst books. What do I remember most about this book? The hero. Not because he is so gorgeous and sexy. Just the opposite. He came across as a wimp, no sex appeal at all. And no chemistry and passion between the hero and heroine. An unappealing hero will spoil a book for me."
3,Not the best for Lindsey,I really love Johanna Lindsey's books but this one just didn't do it for me. The character were good and had great potential but the storyline just seemed rushed at the end. It's not a horrible book but definetly not one of her best.
3,Not Very Good,"This book is not one of Lindsey's best. I own all the Lindsey books and this is in the least favorite pile with Captive Bride, a Pirate's Love, and Tender is the Storm.The sequel to this book with Hank and Samantha is great-go ahead and buy that instead. Hank seems like a different character in that book though.What I can't understand about this book is how Brad didn't know who Angela was? I mean, if you see someone near where you live all the time, even if they have grown up a little bit, wouldn't you know who they are? I am perplexed by this book. It just wasn't good. There isn't much else to say about it.Do yourself a favor and buy some other JL book. Save your money."
3,Not her best...,"This isn't one of her best, but it was still good. Bradford was kind of a wimp and too irritating to me. I liked Angela though, and thought she could've done better, lol. The plot was good, but seemed to never get involved fully. It was missing something. She falls in love with Bradford at a very young age and doesn't think she has a chance with the rich gentleman, she is just a poor farmer's daughter. But they do fall for each other, but misunderstandings soon rip them apart and threaten their love. I am glad that the character of Hank Chavez has his own story in 'Heart of Thunder', he was so sexy and funny in this one as a secondary character. This is an early Lindsey, and her later works are much better."
3,Not my favorite,I will buy anything with Johanna Lindsey's name on it as many other do so I was delighted to realize I hadn't read this book yet. I enjoyed the history of the civil war time but it was not as funny as my favorite books of hers where I'm usually laughing out loud no matter where I am. :-
3,Another Opinion,"I'm not one who likes to go into great detail on what the story is about, because you will see that on other reviews.Not one of my favorites of Lindsey's, but her style still keeps you reading. Starts out good, than you keep reading hoping it gets better and than finally it does. This is one I found I good put down, but had to finish."
4,Pretty good...,"I had read this story several years ago and I didn't remember it that much. But when I re-read it yesterday, I really liked it. Bradford is gorgeous. Angela is good too. Readers should keep in mind that this was one of JL's first books."
4,Long time love comes true,"Poor farmer's daughter Angela Sherrington has been in love with Bradford Maitland since she was 11 years old. After Angela's father dies, Bradford's father Jacob takes Angela beneath his wing as a favor to her long gone mother who was also his dear friend. Years later while attending school, Angela runs into Bradford and their love grows. Now, Bradford's ex-fiancee' is trying to come between them by dredging up a long lost family secret. Is their love strong enough to overcome such treachery?Angela is both strong and vulnerable at once; a character you cheer and sympathize with easily. She is perhaps a bit too trusting and somewhat naive at times. Bradford is a likable hero with one major flaw.. jealousy. He often forgets how many years Angela has been in love with him and is too jealous over any attention Angela gets from any man. Only by learning to trust her love for him, can they overcome the obstacles set before them. A good read."
4,A good step-by-step soap video,It was a great video with easy step by step instructions. The only thing i didn't like was that they cut the soap only after 3 hours when they should of waited for 24 hours. Other then that it was a good video.
5,Worth a Read,"Betty writes with the perspective of an eye witness. The story explores real people in hard times and it concludes with a genuine tragedy. To write this and to expose this difficut story is nothing less than an act of courage. All that aside though, this is a great read."
3,"good service, mediocre product","Shirts were shipped promptly and as ordered.Unfortunately, the appliques began to fail after the first wash."
1,Gospel Garbage,"I expected something worth reading. All I got was my money taken and T.D. got a little richer. I read nobody777 coments and found that he is way off. Having read Lie of the Tithe by R. Johnston I can assure you it was one of the best I have ever read! This stuff from Jakes is the same Gospel Garbage of tithing to get and the only ones getting are the Jakes, Copelands, Hagins, and the Oral Roberts. Nobody777 must be blind to the truth and has the biblical Hermeneutics of a flee. At least Lie of the Tithe will give anyone a refund if they can prove the book wrong. With this garbage from Jakes all you will get is a loss of money. Shame on him for putting such bondage and manipulation on people who love God. Garbage IN Garbage Out. Throw this one in the trash and get the Lie of the Tithe by R. Johnston if you really want the truth."
3,The best lite sounds of the 60s...,"L.A. Workshop is a side project for some very prominent musicians, including Steve Lukather of Toto, guitarist Lee Ritenour, Ray Parker Jr., and others. Having once attended a New Year's Eve concert by Beatlejuice, the cover band fronted by Boston's Brad Delp, I feel knowledgable enough to comment.There's an attempt here to bridge the gap between rock and jazz, but unfortunately one slip, and you're in Lite-FM ""dentist office"" territory. What saves the album from slipping into Muzak is often Lukather's piercing rock guitar, particularly on ""And I Love Her"" and ""Blackbird"". Some of the other tracks, like ""Yesterday"" and ""Hey Jude"" just didn't have the same bite for me. Also, ""Michelle"" and ""Fool on the Hill"" have a distinct Casio-tone keyboard beat to them, but on the positive side ""When I'm Sixty-Four"" seems to evoke the Hammond sound of Booker T & The MG's."
3,Blackbird,"There were only a couple of the familiar songs that caught my interest, blackbird being the betters of the songs"
3,A Rather Good Book,This review concerns the revised 1970 edition. Frank and Joe are called upon by a member of the Seneca Indians to find a gold tribal relic that was stolen from them. Also they believe that their friend Chet was scammed by a summer school called Zoar College. I enjoyed this book; I thought that the mystery was quite interesting and not as predictable as some of the other books. There was a fair amount of action and the book moved along at a good pace. I liked this book and think that other fans of the series would as well.
2,Pretty Lame Premise,"This review pertains to the 1944 edition --The premise of this book is completely lame. A group of counterfeiters are stealing rare coins that are worth a lot of money and melting them down, then recasting them into quarters and half dollars. Then they spend the money in order to receive dimes as change, and then a young guy disguised as an old guy turns the dimes into paper money at banks. ...Really? Possibly the worst plot of any of the original Hardy Boys books. The subplots are also not interesting.However, the language in which it was written in is pretty cool as are some the exchanges between Frank and Joe & their friends... Still, this is a book (especially the new edition) that is worth skipping if you don't plan on reading all of them."
2,Too Many Characters Spoil the Story,"I just recently started reading Hardy Boys books to my son because I enjoyed them when I was young. This is the third one we read together (going out of order obviously) and probably the least enjoyable of the three. Had we read the book over a course of 2 days, it may have been easier to remember who was who. For the most part, the plot really lacked in surprise. We both had a good idea of who was guilty from the start. In addition, the two subplots were way too coincidental when the author tied them together. The best part about it was the involvement of Chet and the Hardy's other friends. This one is for serious fans only."
1,Lolly not Lollys!,You only get one. I wish i had seen the reviews before me. It was a terrible disappointment especially before the holidays.
1,Deceptive advertising,"When I purchased this product, the description did NOT make it clear that I would only receive the green lollipop. Now after duping numerous folks, the seller makes it clear that you will only get the one. Do NOT purchase this item unless you only want a single sad looking green circle on a stick."
1,Warning! You only receive ONE Lolly!,"I thought from the description at the time of ordering that I was buying the set of four, but we only received the red striped one. Not worth $3.99 for one!"
1,What a dissapointment,"I, too, fell for ""lollys"" and a picture of four suckers. Just wanted to add another one star review in hopes that they'll fix this. Looks like we all shopped at the same tim- there were no poor reviews when I ordered. I'm also suspicious that the description has been changed. It now says something about a green lolly- I think I would have noticed that & I received a blue one- so either way, not what was described."
1,Lollys?,"Beware! Even though the product name and image denote multiple lollipops, you are paying for ONE lollipop. Very misleading and very disappointing, not to mention incredibly over-priced. This product will be returned."
2,Unfair to Consumer,"Product is called ""Lollys"" not ""Lolly"" and the picture shows 4 lollipops. I thought it was a mistake when I received shipment and found only one lollipop. Very misleading."
1,Only ONE lollypop included!,"Title reads ""Lollys"", but there is onle ONE lollypop in the package! Totally agree with the previous reviewer - $4 for only one lolly is ridiculous. Shame on you, HABA! And shame on Amazon for allowing the misleading label."
1,A big disaapointment,The lolly was fine but there was only 1! This listing is very misleading. I would not have bought it here if I knew that they're selling only 1 lollypop for $4.
3,black shirt,the shirt was what ordered except the arm length did not allowthe french cuff to be fipped back
4,only one disappointment,"This unit performs as claimed. I wasn't too happy about the lack of a dust cap. The bullet shaped center is not a dust cap, but only a cap over the magnetic assembly core. If dust or dirt gets into this thing, you will have problems. .... bad ones .... Dust will get into the voice coil and the tight magnetic tolerances so you will have to keep this driver covered and protected from dust using your own strategy. It is hard to find a driver that performs like it, so it may be worth solving that problem. I eventually coated the driver with fingernail polish to protect the paper from oxidation and uv light."
3,performances spot-on but sound quality a bit distant,"the band played with precision and vigor, but there needed to be much closer miking to better capture the sound of the coldstream guards. good selection of marches, not just the usual sousa warhorses."
4,Marches II,"i'm trying out for drum major, and part of the try outs is marching an L-pattern, the kind of pattern that you would do in a regular drum major competition. it shows your parade marching skills, your ability to stick to tempo, and your directing abilities. so for tryouts, i need to pick a march and this cd has so many to choose from, its awesome! and its also great if your a band director looking for a good march for your marching band to play, or if you just like listening to John Sousa, who rocks. yay for this cd!"
3,Decaf Tea,"The Typhoo Decaf is decent tea, but not great. We also tried the PG Tips, Upton's loose decaffeinated tea, and Taylor and Harrogate's Decaf Tea. Taylor and Harrogate won by far."
2,Not as good as expected...,"I was looking to try an imported ""everyday"" decaf English black tea and came upon PG Tips. I had heard of this brand but never tried it. I was expecting it to at least be better or as good as Lipton but I found it disappointing. I thought it tasted and smelled a bit musty and have to sweeten it quite a bit to make it more pleasant tasting. I will not be purchasing more of this and will stick with Twinings for now for my English black tea."
3,Fully caffeinated version has more flavor and body,"I am trying to cut down caffeine from tea I drink. However, the caveat is the flavour and body you'll get. Noticed also the high price for tea. The fully caffeinated of this brand is superb. Trader Joes used to carry a 1.99 per 100 bags decaf tea (now discontinued). Kindly comment if you have a better and cheaper product. I like tea a lot."
1,Designed to be a booklet for a workshop.,"There are exercises! This is certainly not a ""reader"" for those familiar with telecommunications and business."
1,"Neither global, nor a telecommunications book!","Neither author is a telecom professional. The LAN discussion is 1 page; the WAN discussion is 1 more page. The word ""enterprise"" does not appear in the index, but ""sexual motivation"" does. Likewise, Frame Relay, ATM, SONET/SDH are omitted from the book. ISDN receives exactly 2 sentences. The striking lack of Telecommunications and Technology could be forgiven, except for the equally apparent lack of Global Business discussion. The term ""multinational"" can't be found; neither can ""ITU"" or its erstwhile equivalent ""CCITT"". If you're looking for a discussion or reference on the role of telecommunications in the increasing global economy, this book is not for you."
2,not as the blub portrays...,"i stated this book with no idea of what to expect apart from the fact that it was about a young boy during the holocaust. In the blub it sounds interesting and exciting, when really its none of them things.I think tha BRuno and Gretel were really immature and oblivous to wat was going on in the world outside their picture-perfect house. It was quite silly,someof the things they came out with.Although this is not to say I do not appreciate John Boynes style to portray them as innocent.Overall, I do thinkthis was a good book but it does not show you enough about the war, and it lacked excitement in some parts."
3,May Be Best For Young Adults,"THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is told from a 9-year-old boy's point of view, which made it a boring read for me. I understand it was written for young adults, but I still wanted it to include more details to compliment what I already know about The Holocaust. (By the way, did you know the word holocaust comes from ""holókaustos,"" which means burnt whole? I didn't.) Even though I didn't much care for this book, I hope it spurs young adults to dig deep and learn more about World War II and The Holocaust.Note: See the movie based on this book. It's beautifully filmed as well as compelling."
1,Cheap sentimentalism,"In my view, this book is to tragedy what pornography is to erotism. The author seems to think that what really happened in Auschwitz was not poignant enough and that it would be a great idea to add another turn of the screw by inventing a totally incredible story. I am not a fanatic of realism. In fact, I love fantasy, but I think that some subject matters benefit from a sober treatment. If someone wants to read a good book about Auschwitz, he or she should turn to Primo Levi's ""If this is a Man"", in which the Italian author tells of his experience there with great honesty and sensibility. I can assure you that it is moving enough. By comparison, John Boyne's novel looks superficial and cheap."
3,Wrong tone for this subject,"I know this book has been praised to the heavens, but I consider it far inferior to books like Schindler's List and the Maus graphic novel in dealing with the Holocaust. The main character is too unbelievable for what's going on, and the writing attempts a wide-eyed innocence in its simple sentences, as though its trying to tell a four-year-old about the high fences and the mud and the ovens and so on. Which is a bit absurd. How do you ""simply"" explain mind-numbing evil and genocide?The idea that a 9 year old German boy is oblivious to the Jewish question is ridiculous. As is his easy ability to talk to the boy in the camp. As is the book's climax. But because the book is about an important topic, it seems to be forgiven these implausibilities. The tone was a Hallmark version of the Holocaust, and that rubbed me the wrong way."
5,startingly realistic,"I do not know why people are saying Bruno's outlook on life is so unrealistic. We, as teenagers and adults, sometimes have trouble facing the horrible things going on in the world and children going through family problems or health issues sometimes put a protective ""shield"" around them, turning a blind eye to what is happening for no reason other than to protect themselves from (and I know this isn't a word, but,) awfulness. So who's to say a 9-year old boy in his position wouldn't have done the same thing?Personally, I find it startingly realistic.As for the book as a whole, it is amazing and the cryptic air only adds to the appeal of it.I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't read it all the way through, but it makes you think. Or, it made me think anyways. And now I'm making my dad read this book because it has real substance."
3,Note the Subtitle: A Fable,"No you will not find neither a tortoise nor a hare, but an unrealistic and fictional story told from a young German boy living near something horrendous. I will not spoil the plot as some of you may be able to partake in the naive view while you find out the truth of the situation. Some call this piece of work kitsch, which is completely understandable and in my opinion true, but you must read for yourself. This is an easy and interesting read; for fast readers may only require a day or two to finish."
4,"Innocent, Dark","Nuisance period for one, the darkest lifetime for another. Small gesture for one, warm fulfilling meal for another. Fences between people from two different spaces; yet of the same world. Friendships that is natural yet somewhat unlikely. Great adventure for one; same fate for both.Provoking, touching, brutal, innocence, all in this amazing story."
3,A Tragic Story,"Everyone is extrememly interested in this book because of the intensity of the subject...the Holocaust. The book is not too graphic. For example they don't flat out say ""the man stabbed him with a knife."" They will tell you things so that you can understand what happened. For example ""What happened made Bruno cry and Gretel turn very pale."" This is one of those stories where I really shouldn't give away the ending but I have to warn you it is not the most appealing ending. Also, this book is a bit boring in the beginning. It has a very slow start and Bruno does not meet the Jewish boy until about halfway through the book."
5,An interesting look into History,"Mr. Boyne did a fabulous job with the story line. You really get to see the world at that time through a naive child's eyes. The beliefs that were held at that time show through this book. The black and white way of life is again shown very well. I'm not sure how the writer was able to write this book but it was well done.I'm not really sure what more to say since I don't want to give away the plot. After finishing it up, I couldn't pick up another book. It's an emotional roller coaster and I am so glad I finally read it. It's definitely a favorite of the year so far since it expounded on so much that I knew. To see the inter workings of the Nazi from a child's perspective was something that I haven't come across before. Bruno is a little boy who will stay with me for a long time."
4,Difficult yet Fruitful Read.,"My son was reading this for his school's book club, so I naturally picked it up and as soon as I read the inside cover, I knew I was in for something different. Once it dawned on me what the book's content was going to be about, my first reaction was to stop reading (this was after the first chapter) Such a hard subject, such pain buried beneath the pages, I was sure. Yes, there was pain but also, because it was shown through child's eyes, it was a much different read than I have in the past regarding the Holocaust. It was a great talking tool to use with my son about this horrific event, and I really think he could feel the different sides of that fence. Each in their own way a terrible prison. I do recommend this book, especially to read with your teens when studying WWII. Another note: art work on the cover is brilliant, once you know the story."
3,Great one trick idea. Not the classic some proclaim,"I read somewhere that the author wrote the first draft of this book in a sustained blast - two or three days. I read it even more quickly - in the queue for a delayed Easyjet flight from Bilbao to London. It is that type of story. It is not a bad book - based on an ingenious and powerful narrative device which executed which grips at the end with formidable power. But it is unlikely to go down as a classic of children's literature as it it is rather contrived, with unrealistic characterisation. Would Nazi children really be so innocent and whimsically naive about the Holocaust? Unlikely. The reality was somewhat more complex with Nazi education calculated to brainwash the nation's youth into anti-semitic prejudice."
3,"Story good, but narration annoying","There seems to be some confusion over whether the narrator is the main character. Although set up as third-person, the narrator's voice is often that of the child, yet at other times, capable of noticing things that don't seem likely, such as the cook's face showing lines of once sporting a beard (an observation which also seemed to spell out a bit too clearly that the cook was a Jew: it certainly seemed obvious to me from the description and events prior to the mention of missing facial hair).Apart from the narration issues which dampened my enjoyment of the book, the story is believable and interesting to read. The ending seemed all too obvious, and I think I felt more compassion for the boy's mother's situation rather than his own. Perhaps nine-year-old boys reading this story feel differently."
4,Page-turner,"I found this book very interesting because you see a war in the eyes of a kid who knows nothing. The author uses a teqnique wich called my attention, he says everything and at the same time nothing. You just guess a lot of things, I don't know how to say it though.Just wanted to say: buy it, it's a woderful purchase and you won't be ble to put it down.A bad thing: too short, perhaps."
5,"""...it is important that you start to read without knowing what it is about.""",Any attempt to describe this book would only spoil the powerful story. Suffice it to say it is a story well told that will stay with you long after the cover is closed.
1,"Manipulative, offensive, innacurate","As others said, the author really botched it with the main character: to imagine that any able-minded German 9-year-old, and a son of a high ranking SS commander to boot, would not have heard of Jews (and hated them) and would not know who the Fuhrer was, or how to pronounce it, is completely preposterous.Furthermore, I found it offensive that the plot went as far as to suggest that two boys could have frequent conversations for almost a year along the unguarded fence. The Jewish boy would have been sent to the gas chamber upon arrival.The result is a ""Holocaust-lite"" book that I find extremely objectionable."
5,So sad the end I almost cried !!!,The reason I chose that rating is because the Book was amazing and it was better than all the books I have read in my life!I loved everything in it !!!!!!!!
5,Sobering story,"I first saw this in the movie format and knew that it was based on a book. The book was as good if not better than the movie. Told from the viewpoint of a small boy in a very bad time during WWII. No real ""happy"" ending but then that would depend on your point of view."
3,Mediocre,It was okay. I watched the movie and was curious about the book. I doubt I will ever really think about the story again.
5,A bookclub must!,"I loved this book. Although it was sad, I really enjoyed the perspective from a little boy's view as the narrator of the book. A great book for bookclubs and to share with teenagers."
5,AMAZING and worth while book!!!,"I just finished this very sad and touching book. I recommend this to anyone and everyone it changed perspective on the holocaust completely. I could write pages about this book. But for now, all I will say I'd that EVERYONE must read this book!"
3,absurd but entertaining,"As numerous reviewers have pointed out, this book is utterly absurd. There is no way that a 9 year old in Hitler's Germany would be utterly unaware of Jews or how to pronounce ""the Fuhrer"", and a mini-city such as Auschwitz is far too large for anyone nearby to be unaware of its existence. Having said that, I had no trouble finishing this book in an hour or two- it may be absurd, but it was somewhat entertaining I suppose. A side note: the violence in this book is MUCH more sanitized than in the movie. So it may be an appropriate book for children."
1,No way.,"The plot and themes of this book are unbelievable. There is no way the son of a high ranking Nazi offical would be confused to ""baby-talk"" for terms such as the ""Fury"" and ""out with"". That sort of naievete would have been unacceptable by such a high ranking family. And are we to feel sorry and sympathetic for such an immature child, who, while going to visit his friend behind the fence, can't always make it to the visit without eating the morsel he was bring to share? By the end, we are to feel sorry for the Nazi father when he realizes what happned to ""his "" son? What about the imates at Auschwitz who met excruciating ends at his own hands?I read this book in anticipation of teaching it in my middle school class. That won't be happening."
1,not suggested readung,"This book is about a 9year German boy, who remains oblivious, against all odds, to the nature of a concentration camp that he can view from his bedroom window. It could almost have been written by a 9 year old boy, and is certainly suitable of writing style or nuance. The prose plods doggedly on, never missing a chance to repeat such phrases as my ""sister is a Hopeless Case"".The banality of this novel can hardly be overstated."
2,Pretty lame story,"A sappy story that tries to denounce the absurdity of the Holocaust by looking at it through the eyes of two children that, despite being as involved as children could be, cannot even begin to comprehend the situation. This book is really quite lame for adult reading; it never made me care enough about any of the characters. I think the right audience is probably kids in their early teens. Problem is, kids in their early teens probably don't know much about the Holocaust, so a portrayal from a child's view that can't even say Führer or Auschwitz properly is surely not going to help them understand. (The use of words by Bruno like ""Fury"" or ""Out-With"" to refer to those also didn't make a lot of sense to me, particularly because Bruno speaks German, not English.) I was gifted this book and had been told it was being praised by critics, but found it to be a total letdown."
2,Too Sad to Like,"I found that this was to grim of a book to really enjoy. I didn't think there was much of a plot and it was very, very predictable. I didn't even like Bruno's character. And as a note i thought the end of the movie was extremley difficult to watch."
5,Honest. Brilliant. Beautiful.,"This is the most moving book I have ever read. I have read a lot of moving books before, but this one was different. At the end of it, I felt as though someone had just wrenched my heart right out of my chest. It's the type of book that leaves you stunned, horrified, and utterly devastated. Next to the Bible, it's quite possibly the most brilliant book I've ever had the pleasure of reading.I don't want to tell you exactly what it's about, because I believe it's important to begin without really knowing what you're reading about, with a sense of child-like naiveté, because the story is told from the perspectives of children who don't fully understand their circumstances and surroundings. All I can do it tell you to go read it. Read it now. It won't take long, perhaps three or four hours total. It's a very short, simple book. I promise that you will look at the world differently after reading it."
4,Worthwhile fable,"The Boy in Striped Pj's is a short fable about the son of a German Commandant who befriends another similarily aged Jewish boy incarcerated in Auschwitz (which he refers to as out-with)The narration builds tension well, despite the main character being oblivious, we are made well aware of the danger, particularily for the Jewish servants of the boy's family.My main concern of the book, is that it is too short. I realise its an attempt to be a simple story or fable, but there was so much potential to develop the characters. Instead the story ends abruptly, in an ironic but slightly too forced event which left me dissapointed.Also a problem was the unneeded last chapter with a last sentence which left me a little WTF? Was is intended to be more irony, sarcasm? Or what.One can't help feel a jaded sense of that the Boy in Striped Pj's is just another book attempting to evoke emotions from the holocaust, but its not bad. It won't take long to read, so well worth it."
4,Boy In Striped Pajamas,I enjoyed the book very much. Easy reading with a prospective of the subject from a small child's mind. Heart wrenching end though but could be true!
4,Different,This is the first book I've read on the subject and on a Kindle read the ending was rather disturbing. You're getting drawn into a story and there are no pages left to turn.I'm glad to have read this book.I didn't know!
3,Unexpected ending,This is a good story for adults. Wouldn't recommend for children because of the content not being understood by young kids
2,not thrilled with this book,"If you want to read a book about the holocaust, go for Maus I & II. I would bypass this one. It began with the author saying he couldn't really explain this book. Shame, if he had I wouldn't have read it. It started off from the perspective of a 9 year old boy. I liked that part of it. He wasn't happy about moving away from his friends. Both he and his sister are spoiled brats from a well off German officers family. About the middle of the book, it started to irritate me, and by the end I wanted to throw this book across the room. I can't believe they actually made a movie."
4,The other side of the story!,We know a lot about how jews children were treated during the holocaust. How a German boy feel about it? Read the other side of the story. Really good.
5,Intensely touching and sad.,"This is a new take on the story of Auschwitz, a fable nonetheless.It is the story of Bruno, a gentle likeable boy, whose life changes when his father is transferred to Auschwitz as the camp commandant.It is very heartbreaking, actually heart wrenching. Its been up to a year since I read it and I still cant stop thinking about the end, and imagining how it could have happened differently."
4,Interesting Story about 2 Boys growing up during WW2,"This was an interesting story about two boys growing up in Europe during World War 2. It is a short book that will interest both adults and young readers. I found the decision to go with a naive 9 year old boy as the main voice of the piece resulted in some interesting misunderstandings about what was actually happening in the story. The plot doesn't seem to be going anywhere until the last 30 pages or so, but it has a good ending that will leave you to think about what happened.The paperback has some weird translations issues. Thankfully the difference is between British and American English, so it shouldn't be confusing to too many people (though I can imagine some young readers would be confused to read about tyres and pyjamas, especially when it is usually spelled pajamas for most of the book).Overall I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5, but since we can't do half stars, I'm rounding up to 4."
4,"A bit contrived, but unforgettable for all that","I read this a month or so ago and still find myself recalling the story and the characters. Particularly the unexpected ending. In many ways it's a contrived tale that doesn't quite ring true. Especially if you've read many histories and memoirs of death camps like Auschwitz and the way they were operated. But the story's viewpoint, from a nine-year-old's observations and emotions as he innocently confronts his father and his largely-misunderstood employment, is what makes it so memorable. Read it. You won't be sorry you did."
4,Good for teens or adults,"This book, written from a child's point of view, and in his own juvenile language, would be a good story for parents to share with their teen or almost teen children. It is such a personal Holocaust story,with lessons to be learned and discussed."
5,Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"My School recommended this book and my son loved it. It was written very well and it was a fast paced read.He read it in 2 days and never wanted to put it down.Thats amazing to me because he is not much of a reader,hes a computer nerd.Its an awesome book even I read it!!"
2,"Great idea, weak writing","The concept for this book is fascinating, but the author doesn't use language in a particularly interesting way. The writing is filled with clumsy exposition and tedious description. It's nice that the central charcter is naive, but that's taken way over the top to the point of implausible. I also found it annoying that the little pieces of wordplay the author must have thought were very clever because he repeats them ad nauseum don't make any sense given that the characters in the book spoke German as a first language. (Really? A German nine-year old child living in the early 1940's doesn't know the word ""fuhrer""? Come on.)"
1,not for children -- and not for thinkers,"""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is one of the most dismal, ahistorical, pretentious pieces of garbage I've had the misfortune to read in quite some time. Its tedious young protagonist is improbably dim and uninformed; the ending is a violent cheat, when the Nazi death camp head's son worms his way into the camp and ends up in a gas chamber.There are so many good books out there for young readers, and so many more worthwhile ways of looking at the Jewish Holocaust. Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Mixed feelings,"I must confess the book was recommended to me by a colleague who either did not know (or if she did, did not care) that I am Jewish. The content of the book has shocked me, disgusted me and I have had nightmares for two weeks, during which time I have been taking anti-anxiety pills.All of this reflects on two things: the quality of the writing is evidently excellent; the subject matter is, to my mind, totally tasteless.Mr. Boyne has a lot of talent, and I fervently wish for him to continue writing, but I'd love for him to close the WWII chapter."
1,PARENTS should read before allowing their children to read.,"I have read several other reviews concerning this book wherein thereviewer states they think this book is great for children and adults.I totally disagree. Children under the age of 17 should not read thisbook. The final chapter leading up to the ending is much to graphic fora sensitive child to read. Even as an adult in my 60's, I find this booktroubling. (I also would not donate it to my local public library.)"
1,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,I was disappointed that the description of the audio book online did not explain that this was not a story for a nine-year old boy. I purchased this and another audio book for an 11-year old nephew of mine that is blind and needs to listen to books to enjoy them. I ended up sending both items back.
5,What a great read!,"I love that this book so easily transports us into the mind of the young protagonist. It is easy to read, surprisinlgy funny at times, and increasingly gripping as it explores the life of a naive german boy during the war. I couldn't put it down!"
3,School review =],"Good, but the story is a little odd, not much of a plot, and is easily predictable, but very good for a book about the holocaust."
3,A Beautiuly written story...but,"I Just finished this book after a 3 day marathon read. I bought it on a whim after readng the jacket, which had no synopsis. I found that I was slightly put off by the fact that this was a Holocaust novel written from the perspective of a child. I eventually got over that and got sucked into the story. It is a very easy read, sometimes TOO easy considering the subject matter. Overall this book was very well written. It approaches a very difficult subject with compassion and sensitivity. My only caution... do not read this book if you're looking for an in depth Holocaust story."
1,"Compare this book with ""Emil and Karl"" by Glatshteyn","If you are looking for a book for middle school to high school readers that challenges them to think about the real experiences of children in a brutal fascist state, I would skip this one and read instead ""Emil and Karl"", written by Yankev Glatschteyn in 1940 and only recently translated in English. It is also short, also features two naive 9-year-old boys, also gives multiple points of view, and also seems to be trying to send out a wake-up call to young people. The difference is that Emil and Karl is well-written, moving, accurate, and full of well-rounded characters across the spectrum of opinions and backgrounds, while ""The boy in the striped pajamas"" is maudlin, insulting, shallow, and inaccurate. It would be good for a literature teacher to assign both books, and let the students see for themselves the difference between quality literature and trash. Don't waste your money on Boyne's weak attempt."
5,Great book,One of the nest books I have ever read in my entire life. You can never predict what is going to happen next.
1,waste of time,This book is absurd from start and the ending entirely predictable. I recommend saving your money. One and a half thumbs down.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the book. It was completely contrived and I cannot believe that the story is told through the eyes of a 9 year old .. more like a 4 year old. I kept wondering if the boy was mentally challenged. This book, I guess because of the subject matter is for young teens ages 12 and up. By the time most students are 12 years old or in the eighth grade they have already read Anne Frank's Diary and many of them have read Night. In California, some of them have already gone to the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC so I really think this book is simplistic where it does not need to be. I realize that so many people loved this book but I honestly cannot understand why."
5,My first Kindle book,"I purchased this book for my son because they were reading it in his English class. I have not had the opportunity to read the entire book but hearing him laugh as he read, gave me an indication that he enjoyed it. I specially like that I purchased it for his Kindle. Buying the book on the Kindle makes his backpack lighter. In a previous year, I had to buy 5 books. Although they weren't heavy, the fact that he had to carry them in his backpack, made his backpack bulking. I love the Kindle and I look forward to reading ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" in its entirety."
4,This book was great!,I read this book for my World Religions class and didn't expect it to be soooo good! It drew me in right away. I liked the way it was written very simply so it was easy to understand.
2,Eh...,"I wouldn't bother. It was interesting to learn about what might have gone on on the other side of the concentration camps, but it was a bit flat and didn't really go anywhere. I would not recommend this book."
3,Boy in the striped pajamas,Boy in the striped pajamas. Good but not great. Very predictable. Author didn't delve into too much about characters.Boy in The Striped Pajamas
4,Understanding,This book was great. I really learn to understand the things they made the jews do along with Bruno.I recommend this book :)
2,noisy...what's with the design?,"The air comes from the front and leaves out the top, hence the air takes a 90 degree turn. That is probably where the overwhelming noise problem comes from. As for cleaning the air, I didn't notice any real change, though I am not a smoker. We will see how it does will pollen next spring."
3,Clean Air At A Price,"First unit received was defective. Company took it back and I had a new one in just two days. So, customer service was excellent. Unit has only been used on a part time basis for two weeks, yet one filter is down to 75% of its life and the other is down to 90% of its life. So, it looks like this unit is going to be expensive to own. It is also very noisy. Controls are easy to get used to and read and it does seem to do its job. Only time will tell as I purchased it for our bedroom as my wife has allergies to pollen, etc."
1,Not for the light sleepers,"Despite the 3 settings, this product is super loud even on the lowest setting. When it's on the second or third setting, it emits a distinct unflattering smell. Additionally, the product description neglects to give us the dimensions of this product. It's definitely LARGE. Let's just say I had to wrap both arms around this thing to carry it over to the living room because I couldn't stand having it in my room because it was too loud. Finally, I bought this item to help my severe allergies. I was so disappointed when I had this machine on for a few days because it made my allergies worst! I was sneezing and wheezing all night long. I woke up with more nasal congestation than prior use of this. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product."
1,Worked okay for a week-Loud,"I really liked this unit for the first week. It was loud even at the low setting but at least kinda a white noise effect. But after a week, when I turned it on, it started smelling like electrical smoke or something and progressively got louder. I wish it had worked out cause it moved more air than the unit it was replacing since it was bigger, but based on other reviews, it sounds like this is not worth the risk."
2,"Pushs a lot of air, but it is very, very loud.","Looks great, easy to use controls but it is way to loud. Even on the lowest setting it was over-powering. Despite the great price, I had to return it."
2,"Cool Features, Lousy Performance","PowerDesk Pro 6.0 boast some great features, of which the most appealing to me is the ability to view thumbnails of hundreds of different file types. Unfortunately, in my experience on three different computers, it takes so long to generate those views that it's not really worth the wait. Even clicking between different folders too quickly will cause PowerDesk to choke for a second or two. I also find it annoying to crash 1 out of every 5 times I use the program. PowerDesk has some great features, but it's too unstable and slow."
1,disappointed,"I used to own PowerDesk Pro years ago - i think it was version 4 or 5. I quite liked it back then. However, I now have a much more powerful computer (Intel i7, 12Gb Ram, Vista x64, Nvidia GTX 280 etc etc) but i find Powerdesk unacceptably slow. Just one example - when it comes to generating thumbnails of images - forget about it. Its ridiculous. My machine is running at 4GHhz rock solid stable (its used for intensive 3d work that requires 100% stability) and yet I have to wait around for Pdesk Pro to generate a few thumbnails. Any other app (whether it be windows explorer or irfan or adobe bridge etc etc) will generate the thumbnails fast). Also, i find it crashes a lot. I am uninstalling it as of today. I have installed it on an older XP x64 machine though and it seems to be OK on that machine. I am amazed also that the file viewer has not been improved - it doesnt read a lot of files (even image files). The interface is pretty much the same as it was back in version 5. Not impressed"
2,The newer the worse,"Theoretically it would be a fine program (I had purchased all of its previous versions), however, this was the very last version I paid for. While it would seem a perfect file manager application for a newbie, you come across with many small but annoying bugs when trying to use some of its advanced features. Several of these have been inherited from version to version. It has some substantial problem with caching, it can cause serious drops in performance in certain situations."
4,Good file management functions,I like the option of moving files between the two windows open on power desk. Directory size is also a handy feature. Synching worked ok but didn't seem very fast with directories with hundred of files.
4,Information Security Reference - A Must have,"This is an excellent Information Security reference. It's not for the Techies on how to setup firewalls etc., However it is a ""must have"" for the Information Security Executives, Managers and operations teams that develop, maintain, implement and enforce security principles, practices, policies and procedures. It's definitely a must for the True Security Professionals library with a wealth of knowledge and references. This is something that I will keep close at hand."
1,Not very appealing,I'd give it 1.5 stars. I loved Foyle's War - I had to stop watching this series half way thru the 4th episode. Well filmed - but the scripts and the characters left me repulsed.
3,Island At War,"So, I was dissappointed with this one. It's about a fictional location and I have to admit, I couldn't make it through the first two episodes because it was too painful to watch this fictional part of Britain fall to the Germans. I read ahead on other reviews and when I saw the series didn't intend to resolve the war and thus, all the tension I was already feeling as a viewer, I gave up on it.Take that opinion for what it's worth."
1,nOT THE ONE TO BUY ON SUBJECT!,Check with library. The other series is more authentic. This has one particular stupid part. Where yongster works as a spy WITHOUT *PAPERS*. hE'D BEEN ARRESTED BY THE FIRST ONE WHO QUESTIONED HIM..HE HAD NONE!73 RS OLD. 19 YRS RESEARCHING A BK i AM TO WRITE ABOUT MY GENERATION LIVING THROUGH THE bLITZ.
2,"Not bad , but not as good as Enemy At The Door","Somewhat like ""deja vu all over again"", Island At War seems to be a rip-off of ""Enemy At The Door"", a splendid British series from the 80s. The acting in this series, however, was excellent, as are most British shows and movies, and I enjoyed having the closed captioning for some of those ""Veddy British"" accents which my elderly ears have trouble defining. Still, I favor the ""Enemy At The Door"", even sans CC, over this product and would recommend the former as a definitive product for the Guernsey occupation."
3,No ending !!!,As noted above; this story has no ending.The series ends in the middle of the war with many unanswered questions.I was very disappointed....
5,ISLAND AT WAR,"THIS IS THE BEST MINI-SERIES I HAVE EVER VIEWED. THE RICHNESS OF THE CHARACTERS AND THE HISTORICAL EVENTS ARE BEAUTIFULLY BLENDED. SADLY, THE STORY ENDS, JUST WHERE YOU WOULD WANT MORE. PLEASE CONTINUE THE SERIES FOR US AMERICAN AND CANADIAN VIEWERS."
4,Thorough,Quite comprehensive for an introductory book. Very well done and directed to rehabilitation specialties. This book really emphasizes the importance of radiographs as the fundamental diagnostic imaging source with some touches on MRI.
5,"Great, easy to read text",I bought this text for the APTA Imaging course. I have been happy with both the course and text both by the author of the book. Easy to read and not dull like many texts can be. The book also shipped more quickly than I was expecting.
4,Excellent bOOK,Very kind of content about all imaging of musculokeletal. The differents technics and methodos to review the muscules and bones
4,MS Imaging,Very helpful when first learning imaging. There are numerous pictures and examples that are very insightful to get a basic understanding
3,Fair text (not excellent),"Does not provide enough information about normal imagining...pathology is OK but difficult to identify. CD helps, but needs to be made compatible with MAC. Forced to buy a 2nd computer to view this CD and that's outrageous."
4,solid.,"Good book, high detail of imaging techniques. From a PT perspective, it would be nice to have more clinical presentation info for case studies, as you'd probably never just look at an MRI when treating a pt without seeing how they move in the clinic. Otherwise it was a good book."
3,Great imaging book,Arrived in good condition and quickly after purchase. Great book for learning imaging for a beginning physical therapist or new health care professional
4,"Laughs, sex, misery and a hopeful ending","Besides being hilarious and lewd (a very good start), the novel is quite touching. We all do want to do the right thing, don't we, to believe that the things we do benefit the people around us, not just Number One? And don't we all screw it up royally lots of the time? Sam and most of the other characters in the book (exceptions: Gilia, Hank, a couple of others) seem like they were issued fun house glasses as children and haven't been able to see anything straight since then. Nobody, most of all Sam, knows the right way to be a good person and all his good intentions can't prevent him from walking into trees and holes. He learns a lot about himself by the end of the book; maybe he finds a way to see clearly. All-in-all, very entertaining with a humane message softly delivered."
3,A good book.,"This is a good book and I kind of feel bad giving it only 3 stars, but it just doesn't compare with the other two books in the trilogy; Sandlin isn't quite as adept at turning darkness into humor here. Some bits of it are just too painful to be funny. The parts I like best are the parts that answer questions left open by Sorrow Floats, such as what happened to Lloyd and Brad and Auburn and some other people. Also, I like the ending; it's uplifting. If I were Sandlin, I would write a fourth book where Lydia, Sam, Maurey, and Shannon all have kids at the same time and the four kids wreak havoc on the entire Western world. Just my suggestion."
4,"A quick, entertaining read.","Sandlin's narrative voice combines the absurdity of Tom Robbins, the pithy social observation of Douglas Coupland, the male sexual wanderlust of Phillip Roth. While the novel might have some unrealistic situations - Callahan's exploits involve a lot of ""outrageous comedic exploits"" and the dialogue is often more concerned with wry social commentary than an accurate reflection of the way people actually talk (see Doug Coupland) - I feel these touches are allowed in the fictions of Sandlin, Robbins, and Coupland because in all three writers' works, such devices labor in the service of an amusing, socially aware and often touching story. Sandlin - and Callahan - are not trying to transcend anything here or shake the foundations of contemprary American fiction. They're just trying to be nice guys with amusing stories to tell, and in this, Sandlin and his beleaguered protagonist succeed."
3,not that good,"Reading the last book of the GroVont Trilogy was anticlimactic. Skipped Parts was a great book depite its vulgarity because of the touching storyline. Not so for this book, since it lacked any sweetness. Sam was robbed of all his goodness by the author, and at the end, he no longers resembles a Holden Caulfied kind of character. Instead he is like one of the Raskolnikovs or one of the sadistic characters in the gang of Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace from the Sea."
2,A disappointing ending to the trilogy,"Huh? I can't believe that mostly everyone gave this book at least four stars. To be blunt, I thought it sucked.Whereas I tore through the Sorrow Floats and Skipped Parts and loved them, I couldn't even finish Social Blunders. It doesn't embody the originality or freshness of the other books at all. The characters aren't even close to believable--they're completely one-dimensional. They don't at all resemble their former selves from the previous two books. They react to their given situations according to a predictable formula, which makes for some really boring reading.As for the plot, I found it overly contrived to make up for the lack of character development. Of course, I don't really know much about the plot since I couldn't even get through the entire book.Conclusion: read Sorrow Floats and Skipped Parts, and forget about this one. Don't spoil a good thing."
4,Funny series,"Sandlin has a such unexpected sens of humor, you cannot stop laughing, at almost every line. I started reading ""Rowdy in Paris"", so funny I decided to buy all of the series of which ""Social blunders"" is part of. Read all of his book, you will be surprised with every page, it will keep you in good moods for days!"
4,Family History,"The book is a very good publication; however, the picture that was shown with the product was the inside of the front cover and it turned out that I already owned the book. I had assumed the picture shown was the cover. Oh well, next time I'll pay more attention."
4,Beware of Stick'n-the-muds,"With the exception that one or two of the selections do not blend well with the piano, this is an exceptionally good CD. Different, and thank heavens. Much of Chopin sounds better with strings, say about 65 percent. The critic who dislikes this probably never mismatches colors in his or her wardrobe, a style very chic."
2,"ok, but not great","Now don't get me wrong,Catherine Manoukian is a good violinist. Her tone is impressive and intonation is quite good, but her style is too cheesy, and she sort of makes things drag. I can understand what she's trying to achieve, but Chopin is not meant for violin. If it was, Chopin would have have written for it. Furthermore, Manoukian says something in her notes that a sensible violinist would not understand. ""So would not a violin pierce more easily through the chords of its collaborator?"" Now I don't even think she wrote that! It's a bit too complicated for me! I mean if Perlman played these he would transform them. But then, Perlman is not that dumb as to make a Cd with only Chopin on violin. Anyways, I think I was a bit harsh but I hope and I know that she will excel in the future if she already hasn't."
1,Skips in CD's,All of the CD's have major skips in them so you're not able to keep up with them. They would be good if the skips weren't there.
5,Fun Children's songs,Granddaughter loves the music. Fun to listen to. Cheap price for all the songs that you get on it. There were songs on the Cd I haven't heard in years. A good hour of listening and fun for the child.
2,lower tray,"I don't know if it's my MFC printer or the tray, but even though pdf size is selected, paper is not picked up according to size, but instead defaults to tray one. Instead, I need to select pages for each size, then print. Also, if I get too far ahead in selecting the pages, there are jams."
5,Lower tray works,"This is a lower tray for a Brother MFC printer. Aside from having to lift the heavy MFC up to attach the tray, everything was easy. The tray connected to the unit, was recognized by it and started functioning immediately.In other words, the tray did what it was supposed to do which is anout all you can expect."
5,"If you buy the printer, buy this tray.","I got a network printer because four of us use it - and nobody ever checks the paper supply.Why get frustrated when somebody runs the printer out of paper? If you buy this tray, running out will happen a lot less often.You won't get as frustrated, your blood pressure will stay lower, you will live a longer and happier life. Ok, perhaps not exactly true - but it is a great investment in a printer you will probably have for years."
4,Nice but expensive,Tray works great - just expensive for what it is. It cost as much as the printer itself - that seems wrong. No problems on the installation - very easy. !
5,Another winning title from Mark Tier,"In 1969, as a youthful 23 year old I invested in Australian mineral stocks which were then running hot. Poseidon was the leader and others were in hot pursuit. 6 weeks later the market came crashing down and I virtualy lost my entire investment. For the next 36 years I never bought another stock.Mark Tier's book has changed all that. In a little over 200 pages of well written and thoroughly reasoned text he has provided a succinct analysis of the strategies behind such successful investors as Warren Buffet and George Soros. He has converted me back to equities, and given me the encouragement to invest again. My only regret is that the book wasn't available 20 years ago.I'd thoroughly recommend this book to anyone wanting to adopt a relatively cautious but nevertheless winning strategy for investing in the stock market. Thanks Mark, it's never too late to start over. Warren Buffet, here I come!"
2,Inexpensive ups - poor software,The ups functions correctly as a ups.However if you are going to attempt to use the remote functions. BEWARE.This device will not work with any modern browser. ie 6 or 7 only.There will be no updates as confirmed by APC support.
1,Not as advertised,"This is advertised to have an 8' power cord, which is the only reason I purchased it. However, it only has a 6' cord, which made it useless for what I needed."
2,THE UPC FROM APC,"This unit is the best idea that was ever almost done right. We have been looking for a UPS with Remote Reboot forever. APC which is known for their excellent UPS's did a really poor job on the remote reboot side. You can't give it an outside IP so it has to be on an internal IP and I don't mean your network, I mean in the LAN not the WAN. It took forever to find the port to program it with nothing in the guide to help and when we did the software wouldn't allow us to navigate on a foreign OS called Windows. We ended up putting one in service as just a UPS and the other is in our office unused, it was a shame because the idea has so much potential but the actual product doesn't."
3,No good for Skype or VOIP,"Had this setup relatively quickly, but the router has occasional latency issues, lasing a few seconds (spiking from single digit ms to 100+ ms, from laptop to router), which negatively affects any VOIP (or Skype) traffic. I did have the router and the laptop in the same room, with a clean line of sight, with minimum to none radio interference (no other routers in the vicinity).Other reviewers stated VOIP/Skype were fine using this router, but I suspect they haven't used the router for long enough conversations for them to notice. I attend a lot of conference calls, and even 3-4 hiccups within a 30min call can be very embarrassing. For web surfing (or when not needing Skype or VOIP) it's a fine router, occasional latency won't be noticed."
3,Worked well for 18 months,"This worked very well as travel router. It was easy to set up and the size and power options made it a very useful. It worked well for about 18 months and I had no problems with devices connecting to it. I then started having problems with wifi devices connecting to it (in AP mode). After cycling power on dwl-g730ap 2-3 times, I could finally connect. Another couple of months later, I could no longer connect to it. No amount of cycling power helped."
1,Drops wireless connection once per minute,"I bought this to use with my Apple iBook, with internal Airport Extreme card. The iBook works well with all wireless networks I've encountered.Until the DWL-G730AP. The connection drops approximately once per minute, with the drop lasting about 3 seconds each time. That may not seem like much, but any TCP packet that gets sent during this interval will be lost, resulting in a delay that can last up to two minutes. After a while this becomes extremely aggravating.I have spent hours on the phone with D-Link tech support but they know nothing about Macs and just endlessly walk me through the same simple busywork (try different channels, try different speeds, move the computer around the room, verify that there are no cordless phones and other wireless networks, etc.).If you have a Mac, I would recommend that you avoid this router. I don't know whether it has the same problems with Windows machines."
4,"Horrible Q&A, other than that it's a nice little router","I bought one from CompUSA a month ago, but it was resetting itself every 10-15 seconds. Replaced it, and that one simply stopped responding while I was updating its firmware. Third one works in AP and router mode, but cannot connect to WPA-PSK networks under client mode. It works good if the wireless network is wep encrypted or completely open. I don't need the client mode anyway but still I prefer completely working units.I was thinking about giving it a 3 instead of 4 but since the AP and Router modes works flawless, I gave it a 4.All in all, great thinking, good style, excellent functions, but poor poor quality testing, which is and has been the worst thing about d-link."
5,Great for travelers,"I travel a lot in Europe. Most of the time I stay at Marriott brand hotels. Their nice & comfortable but they charge an arm and a leg for internet access. Data roaming is also very expensive and really not an option. So I bought this to take along with me to use when I'm at the hotel so I could use Skype and my other APPs. Got in to the hotel this morning and was wondering how the router would work, it worked flawlessly. Plugged it into the internet, booted up the laptop, paid 20 euro for the connection and both laptop and Iphone connected right up. Now I not limited by the cable and can use the wireless function on the Iphone. So ease of setup/use, very easy; Speed, seems about what I experience normally with Marriott. Recommend, yes it saved me from buying and carrying around a netbook."
3,Hard to setup,"The device is hard to set up and demanded numerous calls to a lackluster tech support but I still could never get the bridge mode to work, the router and acess point modes work, but the whole reason I bought it was for use with an Xbox 360. In that respect is still hasn't fufilled it's purpose."
1,D-saster,"I was warned off of D-Link products a few years ago by one who knows about such things. I should have listened to him. This particular item didn't function at all. After an hour on the phone with the polite, but ultimately useless, support agent, she admitted it was defective and it should be returned. No more D-Link products for me, I'll stick to Linksys--whose products have worked for me 100% of the time."
1,Garbage,"Like other reviews indicated, the unit cannot be setup. I tried multiple PC's in all different modes, none could aquire an IP address from this unit. I usually buy Linksys and setup is a breeze. Being in I.T. for many years I can usually workaround the most difficult setups...IF I could get to the setup! This thing is not worth the effort. I'll stick with Linksys. This is another D-Link failure."
1,"Cute, but doesn't do anything","It's easy to set up, but then just sits there. No connectivity. No errors. No help or instructions. It askes you to type in addresses in places that do not exist and gives errors to the default settings.It should not be called easy to use."
1,stay away from dlink,"amazon is a great company, but this particular product is terrible, if at all cost go with another brand. set up is not simple, and tech support is horrible. i dont down products without giving them a fair chance. but dlink has let me down big time. for those of u who have had success with this thing, im glad u did. but for me this was enough to run me off from dlink FOREVER!!!!"
1,This item doesn't work,I just want to complain about this seller because I bought from him this router and when it got home I realized that this item didn't work.I don't know if this person sells broken item or it is just bad luck. In addition I'm from Venezuela and it is very complicated and expensive to me to send it back for warranty.You should be careful while dealing with this seller.PS: I suggest that the seller should test the equipments before sending them so he can't be bad rate.
2,Buggy and poor QA,I purchased this unit after trying the Wyflyer and it was easier to get running however the documentation is poor. The AC adapter failed after about 2 weeks of use and all contacts with D-Link support have been ignored. I can still use the unit via the USB power supply however it seems to get unreasonably hot which leads me to question how much power it is pulling from the USB adapter. I think it has fried one USB port already but can not conclusively prove it was this units fault. If I try to use the AC adapter built in the unit gets frying hot in seconds and never does finish the boot.
5,Awesome travel router!,"I am actually writing this review using the DWL-G730AP access point. It's super tiny and works flawlessly.I've used it a a hotel conference where the conference room had 1 lan port and using this router I managed to securely share that connection with over 20 attendees. Performance was more than acceptable and signal strength, despite it's dimunitive size, is impressive.Overall a well balanced product. My only beef is that I wish they had made the power adapter even smaller, and oh yeah, the thing looks ugly. I wish they made it more stylish looking.But those 2 caveats do not affect the performance of the router in any way, they are just my comments.Go ahead and buy it! You'll be satisfied!"
4,Excellent product that could use better instructions,"Most importantly, this product does what it says it does and it works perfectly once it's setup. I've used it while traveling across Asia Pacific and it did just what I wanted: It gave me an quick and easy to establish portable wireless presence with all of the convenience and freedom that comes with that.My only complaint with the device -- and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars -- was that the setup documentation is lacking. I'm an IT professional and quite knowledgeable in this space. But I unnecessarily spent time trying to deal with setup because the documentation was not clear as to some options. To make matters worse, the D-Link support line was completely useless and, if anything, tried to lead me into choices that clearly would have made for more problems.But, again, once setup this router is a winner."
3,"A ""so-so"" of a product","I was looking for an inexpensive and portable wireless AP for all of my travelling and this seemed to fit my requirements - fit inside the backpack o'stuff and simple to configure. Everything is great, EXCEPT... I tend to drop the wireless connection a lot. While running one device (my laptop) over, it seems fairly stable. But as soon as I add a second wireless device, i.e. my iTouch, 90% of the time, it would drop both wireless connections, turn off one, and I was good. I went looking for firmware to update only to realize I have the latest version, and it's a couple of years old. So, you get what you pay for and I'm not overly impressed, but for just one device, I suppose it'll do for now."
1,Still cannot get it to work.,Very nice looking device in a sleek kit. Three modes of opperation. I spent two hours with it and could not get it to connect. I will contact tech support when I have some time.
1,Poor performance and connectability,"I had high hopes for this little thing to hook up to my (original) Xbox since it's in a room with no other connections. Unfortunately it barely worked at the best of times. First off, the setup instructions were useless, and I had to find better ones online that actually worked. Once setup, however, the device would refused to stay connected to the wireless signal for more than a few minuets, even though the router is only one room away and other wireless devices have never had any trouble with it. It also seems to randomly forget it's settings when turned off, requiring it to be setup again. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,Lifesaver,I used this with my job that did not allow wireless connections but I was able to use this to simulate my laptop and allow my transmits to pass through.
1,failed out of the box; tech support refused for linux Os,"After 2 successful experiences with this unit provided by Holiday Inn Express to its guests, I was excited about getting my own. I opened the box, started the router in AP mode, and it failed at the local public library where free wifi is provided. My laptop uses Ubuntu Linux, the same as I had during the travel described above, where it worked well.I called technical support for D-Link and was told that the router is only supported by the manufacturer for Windows (r) users. By reading the manual, I learned I could access the router with the IP address of 192.168.0.30, and it worked once only.With the failure out of box and uncooperative d-link tech support, I asked for an Amazon refund beyond the normal 30 day period. Amazon graciously responded in the affirmative.Score:Amazon 10D-Link 0"
2,Pocket Router unreliable,"I got the Pocket Router and tried it both at home for a week and on a business trip for a week. I found that you need to read the fine print - it works well for surfing when the computer and the pocket router are in the same room, but it is unreliable when a wall is placed between the router and the device using the router. During set up, I set the encryption to WPA2 and had issues until I downloaded the WPA2 patch from MSFT. After that it appeared to work well for surfing, but I discovered that it was not good for any sustained traffic - such as VOIP or an enterprise VPN."
4,Doesn't work as a repeater,"This router has multiple useful modes, but repeater is not one of them. While traveling, I needed the ability to set the router up where it could hear the hostel wireless and repeat it so we could use our laptops in our room instead of standing at the end of the hall. No dice.I had also been hoping to use it as a repeater when I got home. I'll either have to run a wire or buy something else."
1,Even D-Link Support Couldn't Get It To Work,"Before leaving on a trip, I tried to get this to work in client mode with my home network. The laptop worked just fine with the wireless network as it was, using WPA2 for security. After following the directions in the manual, I was able to see my network in the device's web page and select it to connect to, all the lights on the device were green, but the IP address my computer received through DHCP was garbage and I couldn't connect to the internet with Windows XP telling me the network adapter has limited or no connectivity. After spending about 2 hours on my own, I called D-Link support and while they were quite friendly, the call ended 2 hours later with the support person telling me to take the router back to where I bought it.I'm not interested in a product that will give me an open wireless connection, so I didn't even try this without using WPA or WPA2."
4,Works Great,"I spend a lot of time in hotel rooms and most of them have wired internet access. This handy little device has worked very well for me by allowing me to go wireless by using it in Access Point (AP) mode. As an added benefit, you can turn off your laptop when you go to bed and the pocket router will hold the connection for you overnight. That makes the start up in the morning much quicker. The only thing to watch out for is that the mode switch is on the bottom of the unit. When you first get the device you may not realize this."
4,Good Device,"This device worked well ONCE I GOT IT SET UP. I used my Win XP Pro laptop to set it up and the directions were not accurate. Thanks to D-Link's free phone support (and a 25 minute wait) I found that the device's wizard did not allow my PC to automatically acquire the device's TCP/IP settings. I then had to go into my network settings and tell the PC where to go to set it up. The only other issue I had was the DHCP settings. I had it set to ""enable"" when working with my home network but found that I had to ""disable"" it when working on a hotel network ???All told, and compared to other similar devices, I would say that this one works VERY WELL. It is VERY COMPACT. When I used it on my home networked it worked as well as my home router.If you are willing and able to spend a little time with the setup it's a good buy!!"
3,Quick Shipping,This was a gift so I don't know how the product turned out. The shipper is sending me SPAM now though.
1,Complete Garbage - insulation disintegrated within 4 months,"I am a corrosion engineer and a voltmeter and test leads is one of my primary tools. I purchased these leads to replace my Fluke leads so I could have the added convenience of these curled leads. It has been almost 4 months and the insulation is disintegrating, falling off, exposing bare wire, on the negative lead. I take care of my tools and this is unacceptable; especially when the description suggests they are extra rugged."
3,Good book to get your feet wet in MAX.,"Peterson does a good job of organizing a strong overview of all the features of MAX. This was my first introduction to MAX as well as 3D modeling and animation and his instruction has been a great starting place. The Lotus ScreenCams on the accompanying CD ROM were most helpful. MAX is a daunting program and it is nice to be able to see it in action as opposed to just reading about it. My only complaint is that he instructs you to enter values in a wide range of parameters in his example without telling you why he is doing it. I don't believe it would have taken much more effort to do so and it would have really added some needed clarity. For the most part the book gives you a quick glance at each topic and then it is up to you to experiment. Overall, it is a nice intro to MAX and has inspired me to look for more in-depth material."
1,Don't buy this book.,"Difficult to decipher, hardly any visual references, and just plain boring. For a really decent introduction to 3D Studio try the Visual Quickstart book."
3,It's ok,"I started out teaching myself with this book and it did ok. With many things, the book would tell you what they were but not how to use or manipulate them. I thought the CD was good at filling in where the book was lacking but I'd go with another book."
2,long winded with mistakes - but sorta ok if u got patience,"this is my first 3d book...it is a bit long winded and written in a dry manner. It does contain a lot of info for the beginner, but the tutorials are hard to understand.There are not enough photos of the interface, and 3dMax3 can be very confusing as there are heaps of commands.More photos would help with learning, and also, there were a few mistakes in the tutorials, very bad ones!If I didn't know how to use Adobe After Effects before this, it would have been hair pullingly difficult!! It would have been good if they got some people to check the tutorials before publishing the book!This book is for those with patience and a bit of time on their hands. I woulda have bought a better one, but publishers don't seem to publish enough....don't they want to make any money!?"
2,Don't do it!,"This book spends entirely too much time explaining the ""fundamentals"". That's okay if that's all you're interested in learning. Almost each tutorial requires that you load an almost complete project from the included CD. I wanted to learn how to create even basic objects using this program, not have someone show me how to finish theirs! HINT: Buy the book and read a little for yourself, BUT do not remove the CD. If you do most bookstores will not let you return it. I wish I knew this book was not going to help me before I dove into the CD. Good luck elsewhere."
5,Very readable and interesting; a great resource.,"A very ""user friendly"" book. I recommend it for adoptive parents, teachers, and anyone interested in Brazilian culture or Christmas around the world. Includes a brief history of Brazil appropriate for kids, great color photos, recipes, crafts, and detailed descriptions of celebrations before during and after Christmas in various parts of the country."
4,Not bad at all,"Not bad. Maybe 2 typos. I was getting my behind kicked on yahoo chess, but this book and a few puzzles has helped me to finally win some games. And I am only on page 95!! I hope I finish tonight since it is the weekend and I can go back and be more competitive. Good book, but you will need more to supplement this. I suggest puzzle books, and books dedicated to tactics, strategies, combos, sacrifices, and the openings. This books stuffs all of that into one and you can't do that in 224 pages.Overall, I would recommend it to a friend. It is a good starting place."
1,My Toddler Hated This DVD,"I am a try-before-you-buy kind of mom when it comes to DVDs, so I rented this DVD from Netflix with hopes that my 18-month-old daughter would love this new Sesame Street offering as she loves all things Elmo. She hated it! We didn't even get halfway through it.It is set up in a game show format and the ""host"" of the show is really loud and obnoxious and has a kind of scary toothy grin at one point and a big scary square head. Every time he came on the screen as the emcee of this game show that Elmo and Zoe are playing, my daughter started to cry and turned away from the show.The older Elmo DVDs have all been a big hit in our house, but the newer ones like the Sesame Beginnings series, which are REALLY boring, even for smaller babies and this one in particular, are really jumbled. This one jumps from shapes to colors to healthy food groups??? What the?!?Anyway, rent this if you must, but don't waste your money on buying it. There are much better Elmo videos out there."
1,My Elmo Fanatic 21 Month Old Will Not Watch This...,"...and I am fine with that! This is terribly annoying. The announcer is loud and frantic. Not entertaining. In fact, it is so chaotic that my daughter gets uncomfortable and leaves the room. This is the child who comes running when she hears the beginning of Elmo's World. Running. This film has her running in the opposite direction. I'd skip it. I'm selling mine on ebay soon...real cheap..."
5,Newly Annointed,"This is my first journey with the CM, but I will definately be looking for more of their products. This is an awesome CD with lyrics that are true to form. They speak volumes, a filled with strength, wisdom, the power to bless all with in listening distance. Psych Check, Press On, Dirgy Dancing are a few of my extra favorite but in all honesty the CD is presented progressive format, so that the songs get more intense & personified which ultimately makes it a total package. I am totally impressed and truly feel uplifted through my struggle."
5,Pussy Whipped praise,"This cd is a wonderful mix of fierce passion, anger, and guitar riffs. it's great to sing to and relate to kathleen hanna's lyrics. i highly recommend it. but i also want to say this-Courtney Love does not consider herself part of the ""riot grrrl"" movement, she does not like the people in it, and has never claimed to be riot grrrl and does not want to be associate with it. So you are not offending her any way by saying Bikini Kill's cd is more ""riot grrrl"" then Courtney Love/Hole because they are two completely different bands. ok? so compare Bikini Kill to Sleater-Kinney or someone."
5,Beautiful Rosary,This Rosary is absolutely beautiful. It is very well-made and truly an inspiration. I am Irish and I especially love the Celtic theme. The little hearts are quite inspiring during prayer.
2,Good looking but poor functional design,"It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos. There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards."
3,NO BELT LOOP,"This is a good looking, good quality case but it does not have any way to strap it to your belt as described. I will be returning this item."
4,Very good case,"This is a very good case. I've owned it for over 1 year now & love it. It has a soft interior that helps protect the LED screen from scratching. It also nice looking with attractive stitching. Very durable. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it adds to the thickness of the camera. The leather is approximately 1/8 inch thick, so when it covers the front & the back & then has a flap that goes over the front cover, we are talking about nearly a 1/2 inch more in width. I bought a small camera so I would take it more places & the case sort of defeats that purpose. However, it protects the camera & does it's job. If it were thinner it wouldn't be as protective. I still take the camera/case places, it fits nicely in my purse & I still recommend it. I only mention the thickness in case it's a deal-breaker for someone else. Nice case!"
1,Bad Birkenstock,"I am a longtime Birkenstock fan and bought these sandals for my son, but was horrified to see that after very few wearings (10 or less) the cork bed has cracked and split. It is on the instep side right where the front strap ends. Very dissatisfied."
5,birk sandals,"I found these shoes on Amazon when I couldn't find them anywhere else.Very, very happy with the quality and price. My son loves them and showed me how fast her can run them."
4,great as all birkenstocks,Great product! it looks great on my daughter! Birkenstock's products are always a slam dunk!
2,A Terrible Bore,"It's really excruciating work to slog through this tripe. Five chapters into it, I can't relate to any of the characters. They're just cardboard cutouts. I'm amazed another reviewer wrote so many paragraphs about this drivel. Not worth the minimum $4 you'll spend ordering this from Amazon. I've read better bus schedules."
4,the moontrane conductors,"cool vibe, goes through lots of grounds, yet all comes together right. already this is the disc i put on when friends are over. somehow it stands out and everyone comments on how much they like it"
5,empty sea,"I love all kinds of music, but this is intriguing. the versitility of the sound keeps you interested. I love to put empty sea on my DVD when I'm relaxing as well as when I have guests. My guests love it as well. We need more of Moontrane Conductors."
5,empty sea,"I was enthralled by the enchantment of the music, the sounds were smooth and flowing. It is refreshing to hear the sounds and lyrics of ""Empty Sea"" by Moontrane Conductors. I would like to hear more of this type of music. A fan of Moontrane Conductors.Fan of Innovative Music"
1,Terrible!,"This was a terrible documentary! You hear no Justin Bieber music and you never see him. They use a different kid to portray him and often use the wrong name!!! Do NOT purchase this, it's a fake!"
1,Do not buy! No Justin Beiber in this DVD!,Do not buy! DVD is a bunch of still pics like you would seeIn a magazine not even pics of Beiber withA voice over ofan English women talking! Awful!The only time you see Beiber is on the cover ofThe case
1,crap,"I got this for my kids who are big fans. I feel i cheated them, it has nothing to do with the Bieber. It is a joke, stay away"
1,dont buy this,wish i never bought this its waste of my money and now its in the trash will not buy crap like this again
1,Doesn't stay put,"After multiple attempts to adhere this to my Toyota Camry's rear window, it would not stay put. In fact, it fell down every time within only a few minutes and before the car ever moved. Not only is this obviously a safety hazard, but it annoying as all get-out. Since I cannot seem to find a suitable rear window shade that actually works and isn't a safety hazard, I am investing in window tinting - an expense I was hoping to avoid."
3,Engagement Gift,"The frame was beautiful,but the box was not acceptable to give as a gift. It looked banged up and old."
1,problems,"WAS HAPPY TILL IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY BY TWO WEEKS, RIGHT SIDE WENT BLACK AND BRAKE LIGHTS QUIT WORKING. CHECKED CONNECTIONS ALL OK, BUT MOISTURE INSIDE TUBE. GETTING ANOTHER ONE BUT WILL SUPER SEAL ALL SEAMS."
1,Quickly Break,"Recon lights are pretty cool, but I wish I'd paid more attention to the warranty when I bought one of these. 90 days. Yes, three months. So while most of industry is using LEDs for longevity and better energy consumption, RECON can promise theirs will last no more than a quarter of a year. Mine was great for a little while, and then seems to have lost a seal. For whatever reason, condensation built up slowly on the inside, and continued through the entire bar until the LEDs started dying. I think about 5 still work in the entire thing. It's just like Wal-Mart I suppose. Everything is shiny and looks good until you get it home and try to use it. Do yourself a favor and try a different manufacturer.""Any RECON products that are found to be defective in either material or craftsmanship will be covered under our Limited Lifetime Warranty. Lighting items that require electrical 12-volt power during operation are covered for a period of 90 days following the original purchase date. ..."""
5,White Lightning Tailgate Bar,Very pleased with this light bar. It looks great on my new GMC Sierra 2500.
4,Recon 60in LED Taillight Bar!,Sweet product and looks really good on my truck. Had a little problem when I got the bar it was broke so I had to send it back to recon and they sent me another one right away no hassel! Installed really easy and looks great. My truck has a 6in lift on it and the white LEDs really do help alot at night when backing up! I would buy this product again for any other truck I will get.
5,2005 DODGE RAM,I INSTALLED THIS LIGHT BAR ON MY 2005 DODGE RAM 1500 QUAD CAB IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES.I RECEIVED IT IN 3 DAYS NICELY PACKAGED (TUBE WITHIN A BOX)INSTALLATION WAS VERY EASY. I CHOSE TO REMOVE THE ADHESIVE STRIPS THAT CAME WITH THE KIT AND INSTALL USING SELF TAPPING SCREWS.(MAKES IT MUCH HARDER TO STEAL)ON THE NEWER DODGE TRUCKS LIKE MINE WITH A TOW PACKAGE THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL 4 PIN CONNECTOR UP BEHIND THE REAR BUMPER MAKING A PLUG IN INSTALL QUITE SIMPLE. THE REVERSE WIRE WAS SOLDERED TO THE HOT LINE INSIDE THE DRIVERS SIDE TAIL LIGHT FOR A PERMINANT INSTALL.AFTER READING OTHER REVIEWS I DECIDED TO PUT SOME CLEAR SILICONE ON THE END OF THE STRIP WHERE THE WIRES GO IN JUST TO BE SURE.SO FAR NO PROBLEMS WITH SHORTS OR NON WORKING BULBS. WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY I'M NOT REALLY WORRIED. BUY THE WAY THIS KIT IS MOUNTED ON A SOLID STRIP INSTEAD OF ON A FLIMSY FLEX SET UP LIKE OTHER LIGHT BARS. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT HIGHLY
2,easy to install but dissappointed with result,easy to install however i was not aware parking lights would not work without installing capacitors.there was no foot note or warning or anything. so i have blinkers brakes and reverse and no running lights on this light bar.im not real happy...
3,Second Time Around,Tailgate bar worked great until the second week. Then the driver's side running lights quit working. Amazon is sending me a replacement and hopefully this one will last.
