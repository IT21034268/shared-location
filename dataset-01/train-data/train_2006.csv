3,"Loved it, but the ending was an issue","!!!Beware, there might be spoilers in this!!!This game was AMAZING. I have one real issue with it- I wanted to buy the soundtrack because that is the only way to listen to the music. There is a massive amount of travel in this game- WITHOUT MUSIC. The superb music is only during boss fights.-semi-spoiler-This game pulled me in so well that when the game ended the way it did, I bawled for three hours straight. So I will warn anyone who is very sensitive (I have autism) to be prepared for the ending. It was actually horrible and the baby in the end did NOT make it better."
5,I have watched this game all the way through.,"I bought this for my husband. The game had contravercial reviews. I watched the beginning to make sure the game was ok. And I stayed till the end. We printed out the walkthrough from the internet, it's easier to play with the good walkthrough. It's like watching a movie. It looks so real and the story is beautiful and captivating. All the creatures have their own weaknesses and it takes a while to figure them out. For a couple weeks we were just captivated with this game. Have no doubts, you are going to love it."
4,"Awesome game, very challenging.",It seems like the challenge level jumps up pretty quickly after the first few bosses. Definitely one of the very best games for the PS2.
5,Extraordinary Gaming Experience,"I use the words 'gaming experience' intentionally, because that is what this game is. The game play is magnificent, and the visuals are incredible, besting almost everything else the PS2 has to offer. The characters are great, with my favorite character in the entire game being a horse. It is amazing how the story and action can make you so attached to a horse. Every fight is, in essence, a boss fight, and each colossus has its own unique strategy to master. There are several great fights, but a couple that stick out as being timeless gaming moments.Honesly one of the greatest games that I have ever experienced, I cannot wait to begin the fun again! There need to be many more games like this one. This game deserves 6 stars out of 5."
5,One of my favorites,"I really love this game. For all the people who say it has no storyline, most of it is at the end! Anyway, this game is great and definitely worth your money. It has some of the best graphics on the PS2 and has a great soundtrack (I listen to it quite often). The gameplay is simple but its fun to just look at the scenery in this game and raise your attributes. When your not fighting colossi you can eat fruit and lizards to raise your health and grip/strength meters. I really enjoyed this game and am happy that I bought it."
3,depends on what you like,"first of all, the sword-light thing kind of confused me.. but once i got the hang of it, it was pretty cool. you hold your sword up and the beam directs you to your next enemy, and you ride there on horseback. however, i got bored of this game really fast (after beating the first enemy). it's just not the game for me.. i do respect it, though (most games i don't respect at all). the story is great, the graphics are great, and it's an interesting idea. but i had more fun playing spartan: total warrior killing hundreds of enemies. this is supposed to be kind of a puzzle game... if i wanted to do a puzzle, i'd pull out the new york times. but if you're the type who doesn't mind sitting back and thinking about how to kill some giant before you start swinging and doesn't find that frustrating, this is the game for you."
4,Definitely a different type of game.,"It's short but well worth the price of admission. For $20 you are going to get about 12 hours of game time maybe more. I cheated by looking up walk throughs online when I got frustrated, so it might be longer for those who tough it out.This is a game you'll likely replay over the years. The story is well above average and the graphics are great for PS2. It's really one of a kind. If you are interested in playing a game with great story, graphics, music (epic) and killing giant colossi that are frakin huge then buy this game."
2,Not that thrilled,"I had really high expectations for this game since the reviews were great, but I never could get into it. It does have great graphics, but that was about as far as it went for me. Now it just sits and collects dust."
3,It wasnt what i exspected but enjoyed it just the same !,again i thought it might have been better . and it could have been longer as well . but overall i did enjoy the game !
3,"Beautiful, But Difficult","I'm not a great gamer. While I love video games, I'm terrible at them. Knowing that, I have to say that while this game is visually stunning and well put together, it is the most difficult game I have ever played. You can ride around practically anywhere in the game and it all is beautiful and amazing, but when it comes down to beating the giant, it is just too difficult. After trying many times, I got bored and aggravated. I can only recommend this game based on the visuals and not the actual gameplay."
1,What's all the hype about?,"There's not much to say about this other than it was BORING. The game is extremely repetitive. All you do is jump on your pretty little horse, and gallop around to find the next colossi. Beat it, repeat. If you're looking for a long game just to stare at the grass and pick your ... then this is the game for you. If you're looking for something fun, I definitely wouldn't recommend this."
1,Shadow of the Colossus Eval,"I really don't have an opinion of this product ecause it is a present for one of my grandchildren, but I believe it is supposed to be a game for a Playstation 2 whereas ehe description indicates that the product is both a game AND a soundtrack and even this questionaire indicates that it is ONLY a soundtrack, so I not sure what I bought, but I'm affraid to open the package in case it is only a sound track and I may have to try to return it."
2,Shadow of the Colossus.......,"I got this game because of the high rating it has on most game sites, but when I actually plaid it I found out that it didn't live up to the hype. The over world is giant and empty! The controls are pretty bad but you get use to them. The story is.. well I wouldn't know completely because I didn't want to finish the game. The boss battles (which are the only battles) where well staged and beautiful, they really made me feel epic and grand! However this feeling only lasted the first 5 minutes of the battle, then the feeling went completely away. The battles ranged about 5 to 20 minutes to complete, which means you could probably finish this game in about 5 to 6 hours.Overall:It's a short game with, an empty world, bad controls, looping 30 second music, simple story line, repetitive gameplay/experiences, good scenery, and barely good boss battles. The cons outweigh the pros. 2 out of 5 !"
3,very boring to play,"Everybody is right, good scenarios, graphics, etc, but very boring game to play, its all the same, it takes you 15 minutes to get to every colossus, and once you get there, you need help from internet to know how to finish with the colossus, and you kill them all the same way, there is not enough action, BORING,BORING,BORING"
2,bad and good,the battles were good but after u do all that work to save the girl u get turned into a baby wih horns stiking out of its head it was good battles bad adventures.
5,Loved this game when it first came out,Love it even more now having had it stolen...only to have a better copy than I originally had and it was soooo cheap and free delivery...amazon does it again
4,Awesome game.,"This is a great game! The controls take some getting used to but in like, 30 minutes youll be great! I suggest changing the controls. It makes things much easier. This game has great graphics. It can be frustrating at times but mostly its really cool. It does take a while to kill a Collossi though. It can really start to tick me off. I really suggest you buy this game at about 25-30 dollars. Give it some time and youll love it!"
3,Epic...but repetative,"Basically, not much goes on until you get to a boss then it's just an all out blast...until you've beaten all the bosses about 5+ times...All games get old, this one however just didn't have enough extra's for me and got old quickly...Call me greedy but I just need more! By the way I'm basing this review back when I played it years ago, games now are a lot more sophiscated and would not be a fair judgment on this game if I compared it to modern games."
5,This Game Is Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ok i have no idea were to start this game is so good. The graphics are great, the gameplay is awesome, and the game is really long. Although the controls take a little getting used to, it only took me 15 minutes to learn them. The game may look really slow when your watching it. But when your playing it, its pretty fast paced, because you have to watch your stamina bar. The stamina bar is the least of your worries in a battle though. You should really be watching out for huge bolts of lightning.I highly reccomend this game, its extreamly fun, and it doesent get old, although it can get frustrating at times. but you can always look up stuff in stratagey guids incase you cant find out how to do something. 5 OUTA 5"
5,Colossus,"This is a GREAT GAME . I like the Whole set up and adventure of it. Its very challenging and it gets to you. And the graphics are great to . Its one of those games you just cant lay down till you get done, and at the same time one of them that sets you off into a fit . I like the Concept and its exciting and very appealing . This one is a Must to have."
3,Good Game,I actually bought this game for my grandson and he really enjoys it. It is not his favorite but it is one game he plays frequently. He does have a problem with some of the tasks to move to the different levels.
4,Just the game i've been waiting for.,"I first played the demo a while back, and was convinced right away that this game would be the next big thing. Now that I bought, played and beaten it, I can really say that this game was worth the wait. The graphics are nice for PS2, the controls work just fine, the music is very entertaining as it adapts to the situations, and the story even, though not as grand as FF or Zelda is somewhat refreshing. I'm looking forward to playing thru this game a couple more times, cause the battles with the colossi are really addictive. My big gripe about the game is that it came out for PS2, I believe it would have been an even better game on Gamecube, the controller would have been just perfect for it, and I'm sure the graphics would have been even more beautiful. I know Sony made the game, and Nintendo has it's own ""fight with a sword, ride a horse and save the princess"" adventure game coming; but for the sake of the game, it would have been flawless."
1,boring,"The controls suck especially the camera angels, I got bored with this after an hour. One of the worst games I ever bought."
1,Pointless game ever?,"Agree with all the 1 and 2 star reviews. Excited after reading the good reviews and extremely disappointed after playing for 30 min. If all the negative reviews can't stop you from trying, rent it!"
1,Worst Game Ever,"This game is the biggest waste of $20 that I've ever seen. Stupid, boring, slow, pointless.Anybody want mine?"
1,Too complicated.,You have to be a kid to figure this one out. I guess I am too slow to figure it out. I wouldn't recommend this game.
5,:],My son got this for Christmas last year and he had asked specifically. He loved it and played it a lot!
4,Great hit,"The concept, it's great. A game with all boss fights and nothing in between. Each Colossus has it's own way of being beat. The only thing I did not care too much for was the camera control, but that comes with the territory."
2,Not much to do,"I think my initial reaction once I started the game was, ""Where is everyone?"" There is nothing in the game to do but kill these giants--which I admit is rather interesting. You don't level up, you don't get items, you don't use magic. All you do is find the next Colossus, figure out how to climb on its weak point, and stab it to death. For those of you that have never played the game, I'm sorry that I ruined the whole game for you. I, myself, was also shocked when I beat the game. I remember saying to myself, ""That's it?"" and yes... that's it."
2,Boring Overrated Game,"This game is so overrated.This is the most BORING video game I have ever played in my life.All you do is just walk around and fight these huge monsters.That's It.Nothing or Nobody else around,except for you and you're horse.Only good thing that I can say about this game,is the graphics.They are amazing.That's why I gave it a 2,instead of a 1.The graphics IMO are the ONLY good thing,this game has going for it.I say rent it,before you buy it.I bought it for twenty bucks.Now it just sits in my drawer."
2,HORRIBLE!.,HORRIBLE!! This game is horrible DON'T BUY IT.The controls suck.The storyline is horrible.The graphics ain't that good I don't know why people say they are so good.The only good thing about this game are the bosses. Don't buy this game.
1,Shadow of the Colossus,"Length:: 0:27 MinsFIRST OF MANY REVIEWS COMMING , I AM THE ORIGINAL MOVIES MAN...TEDSRAREMOVIES[..]HOUSE OF RARE MOVIES (AMAZON ZSHOP)Shadow of the Colossus"
4,BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS,"The first thing that i noticed about this game was the graphics. they're utterly beautiful. as in Final Fantasy graphics. this game isn't noteably had to beat. but it's fun. the horse is a nice touch. there aren't a lot of games that allow you to ride a horse. oh, and the lack of loading screen worth mentioning makes this a low-frustration game. the only even slightly annoying part is trying to find the colossus'. and then only sometimes. it wasn't an incredible game and would probably be average if it wasn't for the fact that i was getting off on the graphics before i even played the game. if you're an intense gamer, rent this game. it's not incredibly long and really doesn't have much, if any, replay value. it was undoubtably a nice distraction while waiting for another God of War or GTA to come along."
5,good deal,"product has good graphics, a storyline that is new, and amazingly simple controls so that you dont die avery five seconds, but game is still hard."
5,Amazing,"This game is truly a work of art. If you're thinking about buying it, I suggest you do; you won't regret it."
5,work shoes,These shoes are so comfortable. Not the greatest style but perfect for work. The sizes are pretty true so online ordering should not be a problem. I would definitely get these shoes again when my current ones wear out.
3,Ok,"Pros: cute, comfortable baseCons: front looks rounder than pictured, top lining at the back irritates my heel (near the tendons), base makes a clacking sound on tiles (which is embarrassing. I have to walk on my tip toe sometimes when walking in a quiet room full of people at church). My cheap Walmart shoes are better and more comfortable."
3,"Black pumps with low heel, by Naturalizer","These shoes are deceiving: they look better on the picturethan on your feet, esp. if you have small bunions near thebig toe - their low cut goes right through that area.Initially, they are hard like cardboard (don't live up to thebrand name ""Naturalizer"") and difficult to break in w/o pain...I am not too happy with my purchase and prefer other brands.I would only recommend these pumps if you have perfect feetand can tolerate hard leather shoes!"
4,great quality output - but....,"The results from this inexpensive camera are amazing. Dont be fooled by the description that says full display, it does not show pictures. Plus hard to know unless dark enough for flash when the picture has been taken.. downloads pictures almost instantly, however somewhat tedious to save them to disk. It does have a cable to display pictures on TV I'm not sure why you would want to do this but it's neat??!!?Great alternative to spending many hundred dollars on other digital cameras.. This is a very good value!"
3,Was great while it lasted...,"I got this camera as a wedding present a year ago. Trust me when I say that their year-warranty is just that. I turned on the camera the other day (had used it successfully two days earlier) all I got was a little green light. No display, nothing happened. Called support and they want a copy of the receipt before they'll fix it for free since I am right at a year. Well, it being a gift,I don't *have* a receipt. Grrr. I will not be paying ...to get this camera fixed. It's not worth it.On the upside, if you keep good batteries in the camera, it works well. Things are a little bluish when the light is dim, and I have several pictures of my white dog that are just glaring but...most of the pictures I took with it turned out ok."
1,Digital Paperweight,"Save your money and get something worthwhile. The pictures are horrible unless you've got exceptionally steady hands, the light sensor is useless and the colors are all washed with a grey-blue haze. I ended up giving it to my nephew in grade school and even HE hated it."
5,Great Value,I bought this camera for...and I am very satisfied. The pic quality is great and this flash works fine. The software included is awsome and the video cord for the TV is really cool. The only problem I have with it is that it takes a while to process a picture after you've taken it and you can't take another one while it's processing. I would recommend this camera to anyone.
2,cheeeeeeaaap - you get what you pay for,"I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone. The only time I got it to take completely in-focus photos was in bright daylight when the camera was resting on a table. Under any other conditions, at very best, the outer 15% of the picture will be blurry.This is if you can get the pictures to your PC... I used to have windows 98 on my PC, and things worked ok, but when I upgraded to windows 2000 I was no longer able to download the pictures from the camera, no matter what I tried.Also, the 640x480 pictures are small, and it won't focus on close objects.On the upside, it's cheap."
2,soft ware to load onto my computer (dell),i need software so i can download my pictures or tell me how i need to do this
5,GREAT BOOK! Helped me get a 5,"This book was amazing! It simplified the mass of confusing concepts covered in AP Bio into a concise and helpful guide. Although it by no means replaces the need to take an AP bio class, it focuses the topics you need to learn to pass the test. My own teacher tried to cover too much material in his class (including making us memorize every step in the production of ATP, which, as this book tells you, is totally unnecessary!). This book was a valuable aid and I give much of the credit for my score (a 5) to it."
1,What a disappointment!!,"I bought Jesse Malin's first CD, ""The Fine Art of Self-Destruction"" and thought that he was going to be the next Neil Young (or a close second). Unfortunately, ""The Heat"" sounds like it all runs together--I could hardly tell the songs apart from one another."
1,ridiculous,"there are no poets today because there are no ears to hear them; what passes for it is written by pretenders such as these, men to whom the muse has never spoken, illiterate, poorly trained, intellectually and emotionally stunted. do yourself a favor: tattoo your body and buy this book. one will poison your body, the other your mind. i cannot imagine a more appropriate fate for you."
5,When Homosexuality Hits Home,"This is a wonderful resource for those on the ""other side of the closet,"" who have a loved one coming out as gay. There are precious few books which address the pain and the necessary steps to begin recovering for the one left behind. Written in truth and compassion."
2,Too few biblical references,"I found book to be very repetitive throughout, could have been summarized in 3 or 4 chapters max. It had too few biblical references and did not elaborate on those highlighted. Overall, it is satisfatory but not the ""how - to"" guide it set out to be -"
1,My way or the highway,"Too many gay teenagers have been thrown out of the house just for being what they are. But to keep them at home and rant at them would also be miserable. Barry Goldwater (Mister Conservative) changed his mind about homosexuality because his grandson was gay. Many of his fans felt that he had betrayed their ideals by loving his grandson! If you have to choose between your child and your God, maybe you have the wrong God."
4,Great book,I love the recipes in this book. They are easy to make and they taste great.You can create life saving juices according to the area of health concern. Definately a must have.
5,A Great Reference Book,"If you believe that food is your first and best medicine - then buy this book. I've been juicing fresh organic produce from my garden all summer, and I can honestly see an improvement in my health."
2,JUICES,This book is not for me is for someone who has a juicer and time to make them might be good for someone else
3,Solid on the basics,"This book is a good choice for those very new to juicing.There is not a lot of depth in this book compared to others on this topic such asJuicing, Fasting, and Detoxing for Life: Unleash the Healing Power of Fresh Juices and Cleansing Dietsand others but it is an okay choice with some good content if you're really just after the basics. It is a very small book and a quick and easy read.Note that this book does not contain any type of in-depth discussion over which type of juicer to buy - centrifugal vs. single or twin gear.I agree strongly with the main premise of this book which is that having some vegetable juice daily is an excellent choice for your health, whether you are well or seriously ill or somewhere in-between. It can be really tasty as well!Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. (HFME) and Health, Healing & Hummingbirds (HHH)"
2,Just OK,"I didn't finish reading this book,it just didn't hold my interest. This author recommends her own supplements, which is not what I was looking for. Maybe others will enjoy it, it just wasn't for me."
4,FX Schmid Puzzle,"This is not a Ravensburger puzzle; however, The Ravensburger company acquired FX Schmid; so technically, it is Ravensburger now! I wish the puzzle pieces were much, much larger -- like the 100-piece Ravensburger ones for the younger kids. Then I could frame it and hang it on the wall. The finished puzzle really is beautiful, though. I am still going to frame it and hang it on the wall. It will just take up much less room now!"
3,Times Square Puzzle,"The product itself is good, but its transaction was not. The item was shipped horribly late. It took one week to even get it shipped out. The second reason I gave this 3 stars is because it is not a Ravensburger puzzle. The item detail is incorrect and deceitful."
4,Great Bowls For Casual Food Consumption!,"Although these very durable bowls are great for cereal or whatever else you might want to use them for, we like using them for snacks such as popcorn or ice cream or cut fruit. They are easy to clean and have taken a lot of banging around without any visible damage. Evidently they are made with a special vitrification process that ensures their color-safeness and their durability.They see alot of use at the cabin, and we use them ceaselessly. They are copies of the original Fiestaware dinnerware, created during the Depression and featuring a retro look we enjoy. This set of four bowls will complement one's kitchen ware and is both reliable and durable. It holds over fourteen ounzes of food without complaint or spilling. We can highly recommend them. Enjoy!"
4,nice bowls,I like and dislike these bowls. What I like about them is the shape and size for certain foods and for the dishwasher. They are actually too small for cereal if you would like to add fruit to your cereal. They are perfect for oatmeal or ice cream but too small for soup or stew. They are curved perfectly to drain and rinse well in the dishwasher.The depth of color is very attractive on the table.
5,Kitty cat size,I use these in a different color than our regular Fiesta dishes for the cats; they are small and have straight sides that the cats can push their food against without it coming over the top.
2,Glazing Over the Chips,"I'm not sure exactly where these purported Fiestaware bowls came from. Because it's very hard to read the mark on the bottom, and because one of the bowls was chipped, and then glazed over, it's like they WERE glazed a second time to get rid of flaws and so forth. I suppose I could have made a stink and returned them to the vendor from Amazon, but now I'm just not going to buy Fiestaware from anyone anymore."
3,Courageous but saddening,"Sun Ra recorded this live album near the end of his life. Almost anyone else would have retired at this point. His illness had clearly taken a toll on his playing, although the rest of the Arkestra are in fine form here, playing familiar Sun Ra material with great skill and singing with energy. It sounds like they're having fun. However, the great tenor sax player John Gilmore is missing from this performance. Another negative is that at this point there was very little if any new material from Sun Ra. Everything here is a standard. So, this isn't an essential recording, and hearing it makes me feel a little sad that Sun Ra's so-called life on this planet has ended. We'll never replace him."
1,Two shipments. Two broken handles.,"First shipment arrived with handle sheared off in a HUGE box. It was so huge, I could hardly find the product. (Please, save a tree, and ship responsibly Amazon.com).Second shipment arrived with the handle sheared off AGAIN. This time the handle could not be found in the box. Where it went is still a mystery. Again, the product was shipped in a huge box that was way overkill for a plastic toy. Amazon is my favorite online vendor by far, and they will pay the freight back both ways. But, come on guys. Hopefully, the next shipment will come in one piece, but it is now too late for ""Santa"" to bring it."
3,its good and not good,yes this is great but sorry not 70 ft nothing shoots that far i think the max is like 50 ft but thats real hard to get 50 ft also this goes through most of its water in 1 shot there is some left and that willl get you maebe 30 ft but it unleashes alot of water and drenches people in 1 or 2 shots (3 max) yeah and thats 0-2 refills but still despite that a cps 2500 can unleash more water than this in 3 seconds it is still great for the pool where it take 2 seconds to reload and 4 seconds to shoot this takes a toll on your arm get an artic shock if you want a good recent water gun or go on ebay and get a cps 2500 for a decent amount less than 30 bux maebe
5,Excellent Lantern,"This lantern does not put off as much light as the candelier (3 candles), but it packs a pretty good punch for one candle.I haven't put it through rigorous tests, but it seems very tough. The slider is very sturdy and I do not believe that this will be a weakness for the product. It puts off enough heat to be hot, but don't expect to be able to cook anything on top like you can with the candelier."
3,A little tricky to figure out.,"This lantern works well and sheds a good amount of light. It does get very hot while in use but with a burning candle inside that should be obvious.I did have a very hard time getting it put together and functioning correctly. The directions that came with it were inadequate, in my opinion. We were eventually able to figure it out and once it was all assembled correctly we were satisfied with the function. It will be a great addition to our emergency kit."
2,cheap,Very low quality for the money your better off going for the REI candle lantern. Paint is very easily scratched
5,"Can't go wrong with a Candle Lantern, glad they are still made","Great for emergency use and camping, no batteries. I've loaned them out in the past, and they seem to disappear. I'm glad they are still made, and consider them an essential."
2,UCO candle lantern,"The lantern is fairly durable.Easy to store in small spaces.Candles are a little pricey, but not bad.Here is the biggest problem. I used it alot when I first got it.I would blow it out, next time I used it, it would go out after a bit. I looked inside andthe wax melts the sides to the spring and plunger. I would have to take itapart, clean the wax, trim the candle so the spring and plunger would push the candle up inthe correct place.It is a pain."
4,Handy,"Handy for camping, I have the red one. Well made and when you collapse the unit, it protects the glass. After you slide the glass chimney down for lighting, it can be a bit tricky to grasp and pull it back up, but if you don't push it down all the way when lighting the wick, its easier to grasp. Or, after lighting you can push down slightly on the top of the frame and then pull back up, and then grasp the glass and pull it all the way up. The glass is made with a smooth edge so, no worries about sharp edges.Otherwise, what can you say about a candle? It puts out enough light to see around a picnic table at night and visit with friends, but you wont be doing much reading with the light from this thing.It is handy to pack, when camping, and you can set up 2 or 3 for more light. Get a few extra packs of the replacement candles and you're all set."
2,Julie Roberts Debut,"With everyone saying this album was a very good debut I decided to buy it. There are the occasional 1 or 2 songs that I do like to listen to, but this cd is a bore to listen to. Almost every song sounds like the last. While I am fond of her voice I'm not fond of the songs they chose for her. In my opinion it's not a strong debut album. I'd like to see another album from her that doesn't have music that one long long song."
2,Good Voice/Dull Songs,"There are about three well-written songs on this album. The rest sound like the usual ""nothing"" songs that have destroyed popular country music; the ones that sound like they were churned out of some Nashvillian machine. Listening to Julie Roberts fills me with a genuine dismay: she should be either writing her own material, or really taking the time to choose songs that have artistic merit. So often, great singers are paired up with mediocre, run-of-the-mill ""songs"" that are instantly forgettable. I do not recommend buying this album for these reasons; this is just not an album that you will want to listen to even 6 months from now."
2,B-oring,"Sorry but this cd is not all people say it is. Its very boring, and I was very disappointed. The only good song on there, is break down here. That song is not a good representation of what the rest of the album is like."
4,"Talented ,but mediocre material","Ms. Roberts makes a promising debut but I felt her material really didn't do her justice. I truly enjoyed ""You Ain't Down Home"" and ""Just Cause We Can"" far more than her current hit, ""Break Down Here."" Her delivery on ""Break Down"" sounds somewhat bored and so is the song....miiiilllle maarrkeer number.... Listening to it makes me feel as if I'm on an endless, dull road trip I can't get off of! Don't feel it does justice to her voice. ""Down Home"" is far more peppy and she sounds as if she's having a good time. Still, a good album from a talented newcomer. Look forward to more in the future."
4,Definitely Works!,"I popped this into my car and have been using it for about three weeks. I have noticed an improvement in all my interactions, so it has been well worth the purchase. Yeah, some of the music isn't the greatest...but I use the portion of the CD where Louise's voice is audible...it leaves enough silence between the affirmations for me to say it out loud myself...very beneficial."
4,Affirmations worth listening to,"I was in the process of changing jobs and needed a boost to stay positive. This CD did the trick. I don't know if the subliminal statements work to ""penetrate the subconscious."" But the out loud affirmations were (are) a big help. I listen to it when I am sick of public radio."
4,Very effective,"The cassette version has Louise Hay explaining about self-esteem and subliminal technology on the A-side, followed by the music and audible affirmations. On the B-side, all you can hear is the music. Yes, the phrases do sound a bit childish, but that is exactly what the subconscious mind responds to - simple positive statements delivered in a warm and friendly voice. Since self-esteem or the lack thereof lies at the root of many psychological problems, this is a great place to start in a programme of self-improvement. Hay is an expert in the field and is blessed with a very comforting voice. Listening to this cassette does work if you are consistent about it. What is even more effective, is when you memorise some of the affirmations and repeat them to yourself, silently in your mind, throughout the day. No cutting-edge brain entrainment methods (such as metronomes) are used here, but her reassuring voice makes up for that. Give it a try!"
2,Affirmations are good; music is not :(,"I love the idea of this, and if you're really in a pinch, I'm sure it can help. But if music is important to you at all, you will be disappointed by what you hear on this. For me, personally, it's so bad that it's distracting; it's like smelling something bad....unfortunately. So I can't listen to it.The other reviewers are correct about Louise's voice and presence; she sounds great and seems like a lovely person.There's also something funky they do with the sound to get the subliminal stuff in there that bugs me.I really really wanted to like this, and it kills me that I don't, because there's nothing much like it out there!"
4,Love Louise Hay,"Louise Hay is great. The affirmations are great. I wanted to use the subliminal ones when I sleep, but the music blares at times and wakes me up, so that part has been less useful."
3,Somethings wrong,"The CD is labeled wrong, even on the play list. I don't feel any better after listening to this, I feel worse. Not for everybody..."
4,Beautiful voice,"The voice was lovely - well modulated, clear, and soothing - just the kind of voice I like to hear on these CDs. The music was a bit loud for me (though not much), causing me to strain just a bit to hear clearly. Maybe this is deliberate to get you to listen harder, but I would prefer not to have to listen that hard.I thought the music was a little repetitive. This was more noticeable on the subliminal section where you heard only music. But I've noticed this is a common characteristic on this type of CD. I could not listen to the subliminal part all the way through because of this. Perhaps just personal taste.I liked most of the affirmations (there's a lot of them)but I found repeating every one in the 3rd person to be tedious. I guess I must have a short attention span, but I'd prefer to stick with either 1st or 3rd person all the way through for a less repetitive experience. But overall this is a pleasant CD."
3,Voice,The message is good and the affirmations help but I can't stand Louise's voice. It's too bad she didn't have someone else do the speaking. I don't listen to it very often because of this.
5,Results!,"This CD has really helped me, I got results almost immediately. Yes, the music is a little cheesy but its like eating your veggies, its good for you and healthy! I've been listening to it twice a day for a few weeks and I feel great! I am a huge louise L. Hay fan, and own several of her books and CDs, but this is the only one that has subliminal messages and it works like gangbusters! Louise is like a warm, loving fairy godmother with a lot of wisdom and encouragement."
4,Good Reference Guide for HTML Basics,"Lemay has been slammed lately for spreading herself too thin, and in many cases this criticism is deserved. But this book (or its predecessors) is what brought her enough notoriety to be able to spread herself thin, and I personally don't believe that it deserves the criticism other people are giving it on this page. Would I buy it to learn about HTML 4? No. But it is a good, solid reference guide for HTML and a well-used copy of the previous edition sits within reach of my desk. If you don't really care about all the cutting-edge intricacies of HTML, but are more concerned with creating a usable site, I would definitely recommend this book, along with a copy of the CGI/Perl Cookbook"
2,This book's been out since end of August!,Why does publication date say Novemember? Is this to fool us stupid readers into thinking the book covers the latest revisions to HTML 4? It doesn't! Get the book to learn HTML basics not HTML 4.
1,Just didn't make sense,Lemay didn't make sentse much of the time. Much of the problem is with the presentation and lack of insights. I agree with others who said you should get Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Reference Professional Edition instaed.
1,A REAL disappointment...,"The title and descriptions for this book are intentionally misleading. Don't be mislead by the pretty pictures and the reviews on the inside front cover. It a bunch of BS!HTML 4, Internet Explorer 4, Netscape 4, and other new technologies are barely a sidenote and what little coverage there sucks! The book also has lots of filler material from previous editions. It outdated and just plain idiotic to be in a book that costs this much.Lemay just doesn't understand the publishing reality of todays Web. Her writing is way behind the time and the 2 chapters inserted into the book on design dont even begin to make up ground for her backwards thinking and way of handling even the most basic tasks."
1,Yes a 2. Really a 2.,"Nothing I hate more than a bad book and this book really stinks. Why Lemay has her name on so many book covers is beyond me. The book is poorly written, poorly executed and poorly conceived.What I normally do with a bad book is use it as bird cage liner for the next few months. Sadly this book has a hardcover and its difficult to tear the pages out of the book. So when I give the book a 2 instead of a 1 I do so because of its durability. It certainly isn't because the author wrote anything worth reading.The book seems to droll on and on in a constant monotone. This interjected from time to time with poor attempts at humor and sidetracks that have nothing to do with Web publishing. To top it off the book has the worst organization. Thoughts seems to pop up here and there. Yuck!"
1,A real let down,Lemay doesn't bother telling her readers HTML 4 is a bunch of hocus pocus. No browser supports it. This includes Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape 4.0. I took the book back.
3,Lemay is YESTERDAYS news!,"Lemay wouldn't know reality if it jumped out and bit her nose. While she was dwelling on Plan 9 from Outerspace, the world of technology passed her by!Lemay's idea of design and HTML harken from the days of LYNX and MOSAIC. To say the least you should look elsewhere if you really want to be current with whats current.If you only want the bare necessities of simple plain-old HTML, consider this book but dont make it a priority. HOWEVER, you'll pay way too much for this hardcover if you only need the necessities. You're much better off going with thepaperback edition, it is cheaper and covers essentially the same thing WITHOUT all the fluff. HOWEVER, your best option may be to look elsewhere in the first place.For the basics and a small book, check out the HTML SourceBook. For comprehensive coverage including the basics and beyond, check out Web Publishing Unleashed Professional Reference Edition."
4,"A great reference tool, perhaps not a primary learning tool","I am presently using this book as a recommended text in an HTML college class. It is not the primary text, but I am CONSTANTLY referring to it because it is so thorough. I recommend it for anyone who is SERIOUS about learning HTML in depth."
1,Makes a handy doorstop,"This book came HIGHLY recommended and I have to admit I'm completely disappointed. If I hadn't opened the CD I'd return it. Tries to touch on everything but leaves you with an understanding of nothing. Makes the simplest things very complicated. I bought SAMS Teach Yourself HTML in 24 Hours ($20.00, 450 pages, paperback) prior to this purchase and find myself referencing that book because LeMay either covers the topic in such a disjointed manner or doesn't cover it at all. Buy a less expensive book. This one just isn't worth it."
2,More Carol coming soon?,"Given the considerable number of classic (and far from classic) TV shows available on DVD these days, it's hard to believe that fans of The Carol Burnett Show are still left with only a couple of TV specials and this poorly edited ""Collector's Edition"" to choose from. The specials are fine and worth watching again and again, but why not give fans more? How about a set of discs devoted to each of the performers similar to what one finds in the Monty Python and Saturday Night Live series--i.e., The Best of Tim Conway, The Best of Harvey Korman, etc.? Or why not a disc or two devoted to the best Eunice and Mama sketches or the best movie/Broadway parodies, or one featuring famous guest stars? The show ran for 11 years and won 25 Emmys. Doesn't it deserve more than a couple of clip shows?"
1,"Carol Burnett Show Collector's Edition, Volumes 1-5","I was very disappointed to discover there were only two episodes on each DVD. Since I am a Canadian consumer I paid more than my American counterpart, and it worked out to about $17.00 per episode, which is very disappointing. I was under the imnpression that I was going to receive the first 5 seasons of the show with every epsiode. This is a real rip off and the way it's advertised is very misleading. I don't recommend the purchase unless you or someone you know is a huge fan and you're willing to pay much more than it's worth."
3,Don't do it!,For the price this person is asking for this you can get the first 9 Volumes for the same price as here if you just do a little searching on google. Don't get ripped off!
1,Fake reviews,"I havent bought the set and thanks to these reviews i won't, but it is interesting that the top rated reviews sound like a commercial for the DVD's. Wonder who wrote them??"
5,"Charming, Funny Christmas Story is a Call to Action","Sharon Glassman's Love, Santa is the tender, witty and charming story of how one confused, shopping-challenged but thoroughly good-hearted young woman finds her way through the manic commercialism of the American holiday season to a deeper celebration of what it means to give. I laughed and wept in the same breath, and I came away from Ms. Glassman's book inspired to do my own part for Operation Santa Claus this season."
4,"Nice, But Requires Some Upkeep","I do enjoy this little device and feel like it does what it claims. A couple of caveats that prevent a 5 star rating are:1. It will absolutely melt your toothbrush if you aren't careful. Stick with thick, non clear handled.2. It requires some cleaning in order to get rid of grime and build up. Basically, that depends on your water quality. I live in a metro area so that isn't too much of an issue, but I have noticed some rust discoloration and grimey build up after a month of so on the inside. I just wash the basket and blue plastic topper in the dishwasher and clean the inside with white vinegar and hot water.I can see why the newer model that holds the toothbrushes upright would be a preferable choice. However, it's not a choice worth paying an additional $50+ for!"
1,Defective Product Do Not Buy From This Seller!,This seller is not authorized to sell the Germ Terminator!! These units are defective and were not meant to be sold. I spoke with The Germ Terminator company directly and they said the only way to buy their authorized product is through their web site. I'm currently in the process of trying to get my money back from this seller- Bedford Power!!Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer
1,Not the real germ terminator!,Do not buy this product from anyone other than the company that makes them. Germterminator.com. These ones were never meant to be sold. They run way too hot and melt the plastic basketinside the unit in time. Something that should definitely NOT be happening. The original never melts toothbrushes or the plastic basket. Do yourself a favor and don't buy these defective items. I have owned 3 of these and only recommend buying directly from the company that makes it. Great product that works.
2,What Happened?,"Germs, germs, germs. I do worry about them too much! So, to protect our toothbrushes, I bought the Germ Terminator. Used distilled water as suggested and guess what.....after a few uses, the inside bottom of the unit turned brown. Yucky brown that sprays/steams on our toothbrushes! I've tried to clean the brown stuff out, but can't get it out. It looks like the inside bottom of the unit burned. I still keep our brushes in it, but only use it every once in a while now; then turn around and wash the toothbrushes anyway. Will not waste money on another one of these."
4,Love it.,"I love this Germ Treminator Toothbrush Sanitizer. It makes me feel like I am doing somthing good for my mouth. The only problem is that the sanitizer has to be pluged in all the time, and only can fit in one electric brushhead at a time."
1,Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer,"My new tooth brush began to grow visible mold after only 48 hours of using this product. Needless to say, I am very dissatisfied and will be returning the product. Many others have experienced similar problems. Some of these items may be defective. Buyer beware..."
2,Good for 2 weeks,"This thing worked good for two weeks. I bought 2 of them. It completely bypasses the drying cycle after only 2 weeks.It gets so hot when you bypass the drying cycle that you have to watch it and then unplug it.Good idea on this product, and you can still use it if you unplug it to stop the steaming cycle. Once the chamber is dry, it is dry. Then you really start to feel the heat.I just unplug it, and use it that way as I would never leave home while it is plugged in.If you want something that you can depend on without babysitting it, look elsewhere."
3,Great concept!,"I have used the germ terminator before and the concept is great however, after a few uses something usually goes wrong. But with my new terminator I've discovered that you should unplug the unit every other day. Also, try to clean the opening where the steam comes from is very important. This area can really get caked up. The germ terminator cleans and sanitizes your brushes but this machines does last. Last thing always put your brushes in with the brushes up. The bristles will get fried."
2,Not built to last,"The concept is great, however the basket that holds the toothbrushes in place melted after less than 6 months of use. Warranty is useless. Stick with better product that is made to last."
2,"Not as Pictured, Older Model","Amazon shipping was super fast as usual, unfortunately the item shipped is not the one pictured. I received the (presumably) older model with the toothbrushes stored heads down. The picture shows the newer model with the brush stored heads up. Read the other reviews here to see the problems with the older model. The manufacturer sells this item direct for around fifty dollars. The less expensive price here on Amazon is apparently to dump the stock of the older inferior models. This item is going back unopened."
1,One of my first Amazon disappointments,"I purchased 2 of the Germ Terminator Sanitizers. My husband and I both had negative experiences in separate bathrooms. It melts some of the toothbrushes and, at best, can cause the bristles to be bent, dried out and twisted. Worst of all is the burning odor that caused us to search the entire house for the source of the fire. We tossed them both, even tho' we only had them in use for a few short weeks.Pass this one up!"
2,Does melt your toothbrush,"I was hopeful this product would work as described, but it really did melt my toothbrush. As I use an electric toothbrush, I don't have the option of trying different plastics to see if I can find one that doesn't melt."
1,Defective Units- Buyer Beware!!,"What an incredible situation! Thank you to the reviewers who contributed the information about these illegitimate units! I wish I had only paid $10! I got on Amazon today to purchase a Violight, which is what I had before I tried this product. I haven't had any brushes melt like some reviewers, as I followed enclosed instructions on specific brushes to purchase for the machine. However, I have had the pleasure of a mouth full of bristles on many occasions over the last few months. I've never had to replace brushes so regularly, and of recommended name brands so they won't melt! Oh, and I enjoyed the repulsive orange discoloration of the bristles which I thought meant we had some sort of oral hygiene problem. Nope (thank God!), it was just burning the plastic orange. Gross! Gross! Gross! Suck it up and pay quadruple for a genuine product, whichever brand, because, 'tis true...you get what you pay for! :)"
1,Threw it away.,I hate germy toothbrushes! Read the reviews on this and thought it was a good option. It gets so gunky and it was difficult to clean-- almost impossible. On the website they tell you to put the toothbrush handle down. If you do this your toothbrush handle is too hot. So I put them in upside down which solved that problem. The biggest problem was our bristles falling out of your toothbrush while brushing. YUCK! So instead I bought steripod clip- ons.
1,I wanted this to work - nope,"I have an immune compromised child and am always looking for gadgets to help make life safer. This product is going back. First - it will not accept many toothbrushes - due to the plastics they are made from, or rubber components, and no clear tooth brush handles....None of the normal toothbrushes in our house fit the bill for being acceptable...so I went to buy a solid colored simple toothbrush. I followed the directions and used distilled water....ran as directed, but the bristles that were once very soft came out harder than before and a terrible burning plastic smell came from the unit. Also the water chamber was burnt from a gray color to stinky burnt smelling brown inside. It is free to put your toothbrush in the microwave and boil it....just do that."
1,Not recommended!!!! Even by a dentist...,PROS:-NoneCONS:-No auto shutoff-Turned my toothbrushes brown-Toothbrushes tasted burned-Product feels cheap-Not good for electric toothbrush heads (it will either melt or deform)Recommendation:Use dishwasher or get yourself a UV sanitizer. Less hassle.
1,Do not buy!!!,"I purchased the Germ Terminator Toothbrush Sanitizer. At first I was quite pleased. However, when it is in the dry mode, the unit continues to heat up to unsafe levels. Hot to the touch. Having kids and dogs I could never leave this item plugged in, especially when not at home. Also, I had the impression that this was a refurbished item, which I believe the company is required to tell the purchaser. The instruction booklet looked like it had been handled before. I received an e-mail from the company asking for a review which included their phone number. I tried unsuccessfully to contact them with the customer service number they provided. Five days straight, the number was constantly busy.Only way to get in touch with them was via e-mail. I was finally given a full refund, however, there is something shaky going on with this company"
1,Does not work anymore,"I loved this product for the first 3 days I had it. Now it no longer works. The red light comes on, and it does steam, but the green (dry) light does not come on anymore. The red light is supposed to come on first, then the green light comes on to show it's ready (and also after the steaming part is done, the green light comes on and it dries the toothbrush), but after 3 days the green light no longer comes on. I thought maybe it would still dry, but it doesn't. Right now I'm trying to contact the manufacture to see what they can do."
2,Not enough good,"Only for 2 toothbrush, Whenever you use this, you have to pour water to it. You have to clean inside every few weeks.If you check inside after using, you will find out there is white water mold. If you are not lazy, you can buy this product.Personally, I do not recommend."
2,made my toothbrush fall apart,I have had the terminator for two weeks. It made the brissles on a brand new toothbrush fall out in five days! It needs to shut down after its done im affraid its going to burn up.
3,UV sterilizers are more convenient,"I understand the debate around steam vs. UV - i.e., UV only kills bacteria/viruses that live on the exposed surfaces of the toothbrush, whereas steam kills even the deepest recesses. My issue is balancing sterilization with convenience. It's a pain to clean this unit of accumulated gunk (which settles at the bottom...yuck), the cleaning cycle takes a long time, and it's too large to travel with. I think I'm okay with the trade-off of 99.995 UV kill rate vs. 99.999 steam kill rate, in exchange for not having to deal with water drips, discolored bristles, shorter life of my expensive Sonicare brush heads, etc. In addition to my big UV unit at home, I have a portable UV sterilizer that doubles as a toothbrush case for use when I travel."
5,Good Product,"After looking into toothbrush sanitizers, it seems that steam-based is better than UV. I've had the Germ Terminator for a few months and am very happy. It seems well made and I have no complaints. I am using mine 1-3 times a week to keep germs at a minimum. If I had a bigger bathroom with lots of counter space, I'd leave it out and use it a little more often."
5,Germs,"The germ Terminator should be a law that everyone own one it has got to be the best investment I have ever made for dentialhigene, If you have kids or teens I would get one for them."
1,Melted our toothbrushes,I would not recommend that you purchase this item. This version requires that the toothbrushes go head down (despite the picture). It also melted some of the bristles. Nope. Not a good buy.
4,Great sanitizer...really helped my gums,"I love this sanitizer. Just leave it on my counter, brush and then steam. It auto dries and the cover keeps it sanitized until next use. My dentist made note of the improved condition of my gums since beginning to use the germ termonator about a year and a half ago. The only thing is with tap water the coils get a build up. Msnufacturer reocommends distilled water."
1,Threw in Trash,"I rec'd this item in such poor, unsafe condition I threw it away for health and safety reasons. The electrical cord was discolored, moldy and smelled."
1,Worked Great for about 24 hours!,"This item seemed to be a great value, but shoudve known it was too good to be true. Like an idiot, I did not read reviews on this perticular model, just bought it real quick for a christmas gift. After about 24 hours of using it, it started leaving this brown colored stuff inside the pan and eventually on our toothbrushes, and only got worse. Once I noticed discoloration of the power cord itself I just unplugged it and left it alone afraid something might catch fire. I came on to Amazon and read the reviews (thank you to everyone who wrote them before me) and come to find out I wasnt alone in this. Send it back if its not too late!!! Go to the germterminator website and pay more for the right product. Still a great price in my opinion even from the factory. I hope Amazon eventually stops the rest of these from being sold, but at least their return process is quick and painless."
2,Gets too hot!,"At first I thought, what a great concept. Then my first two toothbrushes burned (bristles became crunchy, plastic melted). Then I replaced the toothbrushes with rubber toothbrushes and did not put them bristle side down and the ends get so hot you cannot touch the toothbrush at first use. I have decided to get ultraviolent protection. Cant keep buying toothbrushes and i want something battery operated (saves energy)"
2,Wreaks Toothbrushes!!,"After using the Germ Terminator for about a month, I noticed the ends of my toothbrushes were turning brown and were burning. I am using the companies recommended toothbrushes without any rubber and of high quality plastic, etc so I don't think I will be able to use it any longer. It also takes up too much space on the bathroom counter."
4,Great product,I've been using this product for about a week and it seems to work fine. I'm happy that I have a device that cleans our toothbrushes and feel it's a better alternative to UV sterilization (which can be harmful and expensive).About the only thing I don't like is that:1. There are few toothbrushes that I trust using in this device (almost none!)2. It stays on all the time. It really ought to shut off when it's done drying3. It gets hot and discolors the toothbrush (even when using distilled water - which I don't mind)#2 is why I'm really giving it a 4 instead of 5 stars. I'd like to see it automatically shut off. I don't feel comfortable leaving home with it on.
2,Not so great,"I have used this product for two months. It turns the bristles an unappitizing brown. I follow directions carefully (distilled water, rinse brush before inserting in machine, clean with vinegar every two weeks, etc). I can easily rid the brsuh of the brown tinge by flicking it with my finger, but still..."
2,not sure it really works,"Not to thrilled with this sanitizer. I am using distilled water, but the toothbrush bristles always turn a little discolored, and don't smell all that good after they steam. Makes me wonder if they are really getting sanitized or if it is just incubating the germs! I don't think I would buy it again if I would have known this."
1,Sonicare Electric Toothbrush Head - Do NOT Use in Germ Terminator,"I'm sure the Germ Terminator is great for solid, hard plastic toothbrushes, but it melts Sonicare toothbrush heads. I just put one in and the heat melted it, so I'm not happy."
4,Nursing Home Nightmares,Dr. Mollette provides a very accurate description of the nightmare of nursing home placement. Anyone who is facing the trauma of having to place a loved one could benefit greatly by reading this book. Using the knowledge provided by his experiences helps prepare both the patient and the family for the horror of placement. His advice offers much in ways to be pro-active with nursing home staff and in the care of your loved one.
5,Old Fashioned Fun,"Good,clean fun...from bygone days! POPEYE and BETTY BOOP are hilarious!If you like cartoons and want to laugh......don't miss this collection.The Big E"
2,disappointment,"this item was not AS DESCRIBED. there is ONE or TWO episodes of WOODYWOODPECKER AND I THINK ONE CASPER. GOOD ITEM FOR MONEY, GOOD SHIPPING TIME--but this item is not the one I ORDERED."
3,waterford wedding heirloom,This is a very small size and it is not as great looking as it shows in the picture it was a great price though :)
4,Good tape for tougher conditions,"The white on clear tape (this item) with strong adhesive is laminated and great for weather exposed conditions, or on places where you don't want the label to come off too easily. Because the text is white on a clear background, it's also an excellent choice when you don't want the label to stand out too much on a dark item. Even though the tape is about 26', you can conserve some of the length when printing multiple labels by setting your margin to 'Continuous' on your Brother labeler and printing several off in a row before cutting the last one from the device and using scissors to separate the individual labels where they are marked."
3,Adhesive is not as strong as advertised.,"This tape is advertised as having an extra strength adhesive. Maybe so, but it still does not stick well on textured paint."
4,Riot riot,"not well known band, but is good too, in the same vein as the Partisans. maybe you've heard better bands...me too, but give them a chance. the best songs are ""Each Dawn I Die"", ""Still Out of Order"", ""Catch 22"" and ""kids of the 80's"""
4,lifes a riot,"Infa Riot at there best.By the end of this album you will want to start your own riot,or at least knock a coppers helmet off.80,S football fighting songs ,that still pack a hard punch[or headbutt].Strap on your boots and sing allong.....with these hard men of Oi."
4,In Search of hannah Crafts: Critical Essays on the Bondwoman's Narrative,This company was easy to work with and sent the book quickly. The book was for a school essay and the readings are very interesting.
5,Good stuff,What is not too like. This is a toy any young toddler would love. It is as good as the one from your childhood!
1,Defrauded,I was defrauded. I paid $25.11 by these toy. The description of the dimensions product (6 X 8 X 23.2 inces; 1.3 pounds) no agree with the product that I received. I received a ridiculous key chain like a keepsake. I'm so disgusted and angy.
4,"Not made for my X3, but works.","Like another reviewer, I was surprised when I received this unit in a package that clearly stated it was made for a Toyota. It installed fairly easily and quickly, however, and works just fine."
4,Not exactly as shown,"I bought this to replace the pump on a BMW. I was assured that this pump was an OEM for my car. It says on the package that it is for a Toyota. With a little help from customer service (wires were different color) it does work, but it would have been nice to know in advance that is was not an OEM for my car. Seems to be a bargain purchase for me and would recommend this product with the above comment."
5,This audio tape was a pleasure to listen to ....,"I love the Instant Genius series. The tapes, especially the one on wine, are packed with a lot of information. There is no long drawn out time wasting introduction. I look forward to listening to this tape over and over."
3,pretty,I purchased this book because I thought it was a book of photographs by Rebecca Cole. It is a book in which to store your own photo's. Actually I find it to be more of a scrapbook type album. While I find the cover photo attractive and the book and pages high quality the description misrepresents the item.
4,Terrific value for money,"Many whisky books concentrate on labels and tasting notes. Murray, on the other hand, gives you not only a sense of the whisky but also a sense of the location and distillery it comes from.His prose is vigorous and direct, fully informed by his considerable experience, and the reader is carried along in long swells of pure pleasure in reading the work of a man who knows his stuff and is enthusiastic about it.Discussing whisky is like talking about great baseball players; there are honest differences of opinion, but Murray can be most persuasive, as well as entertaining.This is the only book I take to Scotland when I go to visit distilleries. Some people have lifetime bird lists; I have a distillery list, and Murray is my preferred guide.At the price, this is a terrific value."
3,Not a current title,The whisky world has changed alot in the last five years and while the reviews are extensive some listings are definitely out of date. The historical notes on distilleries are very informative and make for a very pleasurable read.
5,It'll make you a whisky lover....,"When I was given this book as a gift, I liked scotch, but was usually at a loss when choosing a new one to try. Jim Murray obviously loves whisky, and this book opened up so many different styles to me that it's been invaluable. I have literally worn this book out. The way he describes these whiskies makes your mouth water. And he helped me discover the difference between Tennessee whiskey and bourbon. Long live George Dickel!"
1,Cheap,"Sorry I bought these. They're too shallow to be a viable indoor planter. Too tippy and poorly made to be used outdoors. Two already cracked.I ended up buying the more substantial, bigger ones I originally wanted but didn't want to spend money on."
5,A pop sensation waiting to explode!,"Zack has a special mixture of tallent. Composing, arranging, and, of course performing are the main traits....and I must say, he does it WELL! Zack's first release ""Isn't It True"" caught my ear right after that STRONG pop choruses he's known for kicked in. His acoustic perception on how to put to tape what he wants to hear is PERFECT! I'm looking forward to hearing more from this gem. Keep'em com'em Zack."
2,needs more info,"this is a sad story, and you feel aweful for the little boy A.J. You want to kill the mother yourself! If I were her neighbor, I would've went over there and took those children from her after kicking her you know what! The story is drawn out for many chapters and very repetitive. All in all its a good story,but you only need to read the first few chapters and then the last few, and you will know the enire story. It's filled with a lof of bla bla bla bla bla...."
5,No whats funny,"I know the one daughter Jackie she's my best fried, her friend came across this book one day and jackie saw it and about died, her and her sister lauren were livid because they didnt know it exsisted to let everyone no right now...coming soon on hte discovery channel there will be a movie about him with interviews from the mother and everything...she fianlly barried it deep inside her that she helpped kill her lil brother by telling him to lie she goes to bed every night knowing that and it kills here.......since she was put into foster car then her sister lauren took her in and she couldn't take it anymore i never thought i would be reading a story abt my best friends brother but everytime i read it i get so angry i cant even look at jackie but i know deep down it kills her in side but that is my point of view on all this and to update everyone on what happened to jackie"
1,Disappointed with this one!,"Rarely do I give up reading a book-this one however I did. After struggling through the first thirty pages or so, I called it a day. Written without flare... down right boring. Maybe someone else's cup of tea, but not mine!"
2,Too simple,"This is an overly simplified introduction to Texas Hold'em and 7 card stud. The Texas Hold'em instruction is not much more than you would get watching any poker show's introduction such as the WPT. The dealer also didn't ""burn"" a card between streets which is not the correct way to deal. If you were a beginner you would never pick up on that, but it was an annoyance to me. The only thing I got out of this video is insight into why it is called the turn card, which is why it I gave this two stars. If you want to learn the basics of 7 card stud and you absolutely have to have it on video, this might be okay, but only because the number of available videos is much lower than for Texas Hold'em. Bottom line your money and time are better off somewhere else."
3,Cute,"The convertible halter is cute, and easy enough from which to make a pattern. It would have been nice to include pictures and/or instructions for the different suggested styles. I ended up searching their site for pictures.Some styles shown online are more practical than others - movement is restricted for the sake of modesty. Of the dozen or so styles, only a handful are truly practical.If you are clever, by all means, pick up one, use it as a pattern or stepping off point to create your own cute tops. Wider and longer fabric would help the slippage/coverage issues, using two together would add versatility as well."
4,A good book to start with,This is a good read and pretty good for picking up useful words when you are going to be travelling. Bear in mind that is was written some time ago and therefore some of the words/phrases listed might be a bit dated and have left the modern lingo. Good historical info and amusing misunderstandings also are featured.
4,i liked it,"Every time I think of this man, I remember ""Love and Happiness"" and dancing to his music when I was a little girl and liking it down in a friend's basement. Reading this book brought back the memories and more. Obviously, this man has truly paid his dues, I feel after reading it though, that he either had some more to say and or there is sequel coming. One thing I like is that when he was on his own, he never wanted to give up. He just kept on no matter what. He had doubts, but he kept on. His deference to Willie Mitchell is touching. A lot of folk don't remember the ones who helped them up. He did, and the thing with that was they both acted liked gentlemen in their business dealings. when they agreed to do business together, they were tight, and when they decided to part, it was still all good. I don't think we heard the end of the Rev.Green though. Stay tuned."
4,"For Music Lovers, An Inspiring Read","For the truly musically inclined, this book will touch your soul. Al Green's love of music is more than just words and songs, it goes to the core - the everyday sounds of life. True music lovers will identify with his use of poetic imagery to describe the impact music made throughout and how blessed his life has been through this gift. While I found the first half of the book, which covered his childhood thru his beginnings as a solo artist, absolutely engrossing, the second half felt a bit rushed. There was a need for more to fill in the details of his later years. I do commend Green and Seay for leaving out the gory details of life on the road and the wild stories that came with it."
5,Very Eye-Opening,Al Green is one of the Baddest talents the Music World has ever Heard.His Genius is Timeless.but after Reading this Book You Respect Him even more.alot of Artists have made music about being in different Worlds trying to balance them out but MR.AL Green did Live it.he paid his dues like so many Artists before&Since.it's a real Eye-Opener for Many who didn't know about this Man's Overcomings.a Must Read.
1,I got the wrong title when I rented this.,"I'm and old fan of these shows and was waiting a long time after the argument over rights to finish so I could see some of these again. I'll always love the show, but when I went to play this one, it was actually some old circa 1930's movie I had never heard of and wasn't particularly interested in seeing. Amazon refunded my money when I notified them, but I have no idea if they fixed the problem. Let the buyer beware."
1,"John Gray's ""PhD""","To the reviewer who said that John Gray has a PhD -- yes, he does...one he got via mail order."
4,It works for me.,"Okay, the book is repetitive and occasionally cloying (the 'love letters' are a little bit hilarious) but I have to say that when I look back at former relationships, there were arguments that could have been scripted from the pages of this book. Of course, it isn't going to apply to all individuals, nor do I think that it pretends to do so. I've found that by making some of the suggested adjustments, I really do get better results in dealing with men. Ultimately, that's the best testimonial that I can give."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book!,"I read voraciously on the topic of language, and had never in my life returned a book until I bought this one. For anyone interested in a vastly superior treatment of the topic which isn't written for 3rd graders, try ""You just don't understand"" by Deborah Tannen."
4,Very Empowering,"I found this book to be not only full of truths but empowering. Once you understand certain behaviors it makes it so much easier to deal with them. Now women don't have to take these things personally.HOWEVER--The one issue I did have with this book is that it may give a little too many excuses to men. Not all their behaviors can be explained by their being different. Some of the examples of 'acceptable' male behavior I thought were clearly caused by laziness or lack of caring. They were a little too extreme on each end. If you take what you read here for what its worth you will find lots of really helpful information mixed in with a few things that go over the top.Other books I found to be very insightful in matters of women and men are Nancy Madore's ""Enchanted"" and ""Our Bodies Ourselves"""
1,BAD,This book is superficial and stereotypes people. It is the worst of the pop psych genre. For really good books read THE ANGRY MARRIAGE BY DR. BONNIE MASLIN. This is the best of its kind and it really can open your eyes to the self defeating patterns couples can get locked into. Debra Tannen is also worth a read.
1,It would be O stars if that were an option!,"A dreadful apologia for the selfish, patrician behaviour that society allows men to exhibit. Go read some Germaine Greer"
1,Qualifications,"Before you buy this book and before you start applying these principles to your life, you have a right to know about John Gray's qualifications. Both his bachelors and masters degrees were awarded by a farcical unaccredited ""school"" run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, which is difficult to pin down, but rumored to have consisted of a few desks in a hotel in Seelisberg, Switzerland. His PHD was ""earned"" from Columbia Pacific University, a mail-order diploma mill that was shut down by the California attorney general. I'm not saying that his ideas are all worthless; I've read the book and there do seem to be a few common sense pointers. I'm just saying approach with caution, because Mr. Gray seems to have a huge credibility gap, as far as I am concerned."
4,Communication 101: Reading between the Lines,"This is a great fundamental guide to communication. In Mars & Venus, Gray uses the analogy of men and women originating from different planets,therefore speaking different languages, with different traditions and nonverbals. He then proceeds to translate the languages and characteristics as one might if you were travelling to a new and unfamiliar country. He provides ample examples of each of his points.My partner and I enjoyed many laughs after reading this book as we compared ourselves to the typical Martian or Venutian. The insights were spot on. I would recommend this book to anyone considering living or working with the opposite sex."
5,An invaluable resource.,"Yes, it is a bit gimicky, but that just adds to it's charm, and adding humor into a subject that makes everyone tense and emotional only helps lighten the mood. Like another person said in their review, this is an invaluable resource. This book doesn't focus on how to play games with the opposite sex to win them over. I hate books like that. No one is truly happy playing games and pretending to be someone else in order to get the person they want because deep down we want the opposite sex to understand and like us for who we are, and this book helps us learn how to be oursleves and get what we want, what we really want. This book has not only helped me connect more with my boyfriend, but has also allowed me to understand other men in my life, like my father and brother. =) The gimicky language makes reading it more fun."
1,-00000009 Very Poorly Written and Sexist,"According to John Gray,women are sexless,that women have to be brought into desire by romance. Also it implies that women need a men to sort their feelings out ...and without this women supposedly ""crash"" like waves...just more of the 90's rot about how women are this way or that.. ..."
1,"Simple-minded, stereotypical, clap-trap.",It is truly sad that this is the kind of simple-minded rhetoric that really gets a response in our society. It's easy to understand so its a runaway best seller. Is anyone out there thinking?
1,Stereotyping never did anyone any REAL good!,"Blech! Sometimes men and women do communicate in different ways, but often women do what Gray says men do, and vice versa. It's just two different STYLES, not biologically programmed ways of speaking or thinking. A much more intelligent, yet highly engaging, book, is Deborah Tannen's formerly bestselling YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. Don't give your money to Gray. He's pandering to society's ignorance and hunger for easy answers to complex relationship issues. Don't fall for his quick, short-term fixes. Intimacy can never result from seeing your partner as an alien creature."
4,Insightful view on relationships,"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus, by John Gray, is truly a great way to learn more about yourself and the opposite sex. I would rate this book 4 stars. One, complaint I had with it, was the book was too repetitive. This can be useful sometimes, but it gets old after a while. Also, it was very challenging to me as a reader, at least not as much as I thought it would be. The truth behind it is so true it is scary. When reading about the women, I found myself nodding all the time, in agreement. When I read bits and pieces to a couple of guy friends to get their opinion. They kept saying exactly. My step-dad even quoted the book, without reading it, about a guy's point of view. It is a very helpful guide to relationships that I think everyone in any type of relationship should read. You may even learn something about yourself."
1,"yes, I'm afraid it is garbage","Just another biologically determinist argument for the status quo. Force yourself to read it if you must, but, be warned, it is painful"
1,"most people are from earth, pop psychologists are from hell","if this book is so good and the answer to all our relationship problems, why has he come out with so many mutations including ""mars and venus single again""? my advice: don't give him your money!!!"
3,"good, but book is great!","I have a considerable drive to work so I decided to revisit this book via audiobook. I think a reader w a better voice would further benefit this audiobook. I knew the audiobook covered much less content then the book but some really good material was left out.If I had not read the book, I likely would have given this at least a 4. If you haven't read the book then I recommend this audiobook. If you have time, I highly recommend the book."
5,great book!,I wish i read this book long time ago. It helped me to understand so many things about my relationship. I would recommend this book of anyone that thinks his/her relationship needs help specially on how to understand your partner
2,Agonizingly Repetitive,"Mars/Venus has some good material that is repeated so many times that the book is not enjoyable to read. Also loses points for including a ""blame-it-on-your-repressed-childhood"" section."
4,New Insights,This book was really good from the start. It gave me new insights about myself and about the opposite sex. I would say it is a must have for any relationship. It can help make things work or make things work better.
4,Has helped my wife and me communicate better,John Gray may not be the most eloquent writer. He's writing stuff that should be common sense. However I found it quite helpful. My wife and I are communicating better.
3,Made some good points!,"Hi All,I have to say that the CD was not bad at all. I thought it would have been a little longer but it was still ok. It made some very interesting compeling points. I would recommend that anyone read this if they have any problems or current issues with their spouse.Reinhard"
1,Hard to believe anyone takes this book seriously,The advice is based on stereotypes. It is at best completely outdated if it was ever applicable. It certainly is unlike people I know in 2012. It is insulting to both men and women. What specific research was done for this book? What academicians agree with this guy? Just seems laughable.
5,Helpful for understanding the differences between the sexes.,"This is an excellent book to help understand the differences between men and women. Even if you are in the best relationship, it will help you to communicate your feelings and know what your partner is thinking. A must for anyone and everyone"
2,readable but not very useful,Gray's book offers a great deal of correct but superficial observations on men and women trying to work out better relationships. The book lacks depth and sorely needs it
4,"Profound, but profoundly secular.","I read this book partly for the same reasons as reviewer Charles Fichera stated: Elders of my church recomended it (and actually use it as a marriage counciling resource).I would recomend it, but only with the reservation that it has a profoundly secular outlook on Love. It speeks about ""Getting the Love you deserve"" and even the subtitle includes ""Getting what you want in your relationships."" True love is not about getting, but giving of yourself to another (1 Corinthians 13). I found that, with a few minor exceptions, keeping my mind on 'other-centeredness' while reading, I was able to easily adapt most of the book's very useful philosophy."
5,Couples need to read,Any couple that has been going through a rocky time in there relationship needs to read this book. It opened my eyes and it will definately open yours.
2,This book has obviously been written by a man.,"This book did have some enlightening ideas but still placed the burden of a successful relationship squarely on the woman. It continuously stressed that the woman should be more loving and giving and understanding. Sorry, but it's a two way street in a relationship, with EQUAL responsibility"
2,Totally One-Sided,"This book was a disappointment. Though some of the points were valid and the author was very insightful about the point values of large gifts vs small gifts, I felt as though it all boiled down to this: Women, put the needs of the man before your own. Let them go crawl in their caves until THEY are ready to deal with you or any issues that might need to be discussed. How convenient for the men and how sad that it didn't encourage the men to deal with issues."
1,Why Phds write so much junk?,I've never met anyone who read this book who didn't have a serious problem about their sexuality. It makes me vomit....
1,Beware pop psychology!,"Better to find books written by certified marital therapists, who also use legitimate research in the field to guide their writing. Much of what he writes goes against what most trained marital and family therapists advise."
3,"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus",Ideas are right on but repeated constantly. Gets a bit boring to hear the same idea restated over and over.
2,"Basically good, but incredibly repetitious","Having read this book during a time of need, I was pleased with the first couple of chapters. However, after that, the same idea was just rehashed over and over and over again, as though we were all idiots... Also, I object to the way he tends to generalize... ""All men..."" and ""All women"".. Irritating to say the least. However, if one takes this at a superficial level, rather as one would take a horoscope, one could sort out the chaff from the corn, altho' then it's an awfully thin book... :-) Has its good points, but definitely needs the Cliff notes. I couldn't finish it... Too self-serving for me, I'm afraid."
5,This is my other Bible. - Ursula Shepherd,"I use this book as a reference especially when I'm feeling down in my relationship. It has taught me so many things and I use it as a constant reminder. I have not found a more beautifully written book about relationships, be it from outta space. Thanks Dr Gray. You're something special, and even if only for me, your purpose on earth has been found!"
5,Excellent handbook -- park it by the toilet!,"Very good characterization of the subtle differences in the communication modes and thought processes of males and females. Wife & I found author's analogies to be right on target in many cases. It helps us identify ""hard spots"" we get in, which is the first step in getting through to a solution.Now, for example, both my wife and I can understand that/when I'm in my cave. Our next step: get Wife to stop climbing into my cave to see what's wrong and to help with whatever I might be doing in there!!I like to review portions of the book periodically to help keep things in perspective. That's why I keep it in the bathroom.I look forward to a sequel about ""Mars and Venus in the Workplace."""
4,Good backbone,I think this book has many great stategies in coping and understanding the opposite sex as well with dealing with difficult emotions. However I think it is somewhat manipulative and deceptive. I also feel that this book is more of a guide to helping a women get the love she needs rather than a man getting the love he needs.
1,What's the Deal with this book?,"The author should have named this one ""Men are from Mars, Women from Hell!!!"
3,Generally sound but a bit too many generalizations,"This book has been around for a while and I've finally read it myself. His insights are practical and his metaphoric language is memorable. For the most part, his generalizations are accurate, but I also believe that there are more individual traits that can't be generalized solely on gender that make some of what this author has to say inaccurate."
2,"MEN ARE FROM MARS , WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS",MY FRIEND HAD CD WITH SAME TITLE AND THAT CD HAD MORE INFORMATION THAN MINE
1,A rancid cesspool of misogyny,"Gray's nauseating, ill-begotten ""theories"" are rife with the kind of appalling views that rapists might use to justify their crimes. This wretched piece of vile, self-serving propaganda nearly made me reconsider my views on censorship."
1,this book won't help you,"Only people of compatible personality types can have a great relationship. You won't know what personality type you are unless you invest your money in Socionics by Rod Novichkov. Communication problems start with misunderstandings and misunderstandings are from the way we process information and give out the answers. Only C1 partners (you'll know what that is if you read Socionics) have the right combination of compatibility where when you say ""Honey, I want to be left alone for a few minutes because I want to think things over"" means just exactly what you meant to say and nothing more and your partners understands it that way."
4,Good book on fundamentals but it could go further,This is a timeless classic that is a good book to give the fundamentals of men and women. It would be helpful to have more information on what you can do or change in yourself to work with the opposite sex. A good read and worth having in your library.Michael CooganCo-AuthorKnow Your Pig - Playful Relationship Advice for Understanding Your Man(Pig)www.knowyourpig.com
3,A Simplistic Guide,"A rather simplistic approach that offers a minimum level of insight into the differences between men and women. Read it at face value and don't expect a real enlightening experience. Readers interested in a more insightful view of how men and women differ in their view of sex and relationships should read FRIED CALAMARI, a well written, funny novel between a man and a woman on a first date sharing their views of sex and relationships."
2,Yawn,Ho hum. This book is highly overrated in my opinion. Tell me something I didn't already know. THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE and DONT SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF IN LOVE are far more insightful and useful.
1,Only because zero isn't an option!,"This book was awful. Totally repetitive, simplistic, and sexist. Don't waste your time or money. It's authors like this who give the self-help genre a bad name. Gray is a terrible writer, and the information he gives is common sense."
1,Ready to have the obvious repeated to you for 300 pages?,"Forced by my girlfriend to go though this agonizing text, I was struck with the beastly style, overweening self-congradulations (golly, aren't I clever for coming up with these insights in to human relations!) and general bad writing. Egads! What madness is this? The point, if I gather correctly, is that men and women communicate differently. Only the truly credulous fools who bought into the whole ""gender-neutral"" revolution are surprised -- the rest of us just look puzzled and say: ""Well, DUH!""It is instructive to also note a dirty little secret: John Gray, PhD, the relationship expert/guru is a divorced man ... whose ex-wife, Barbara DeAngelis, PhD, is yet ANOTHER ""relationship expert/guru"". Dear reader, would you take legal advice from a convicted felon? Psychological advice from a schitzophenic?"
2,Simplistic and Patronizing,"Deborah Tannen's books are superior. I sensed a ""There, there little woman"" attitude that made my teeth hurt. The differences in communciation style, though helpful to adolescents, could have been set out in one chapter."
1,two disc set - missed too much of the VIP info,"i've read the book a few times, and had the whole unabridged version on CD rom. both were wonderful to read and use.this was two discs long, and it seemed to miss the most important points of the unabridged versions.if i had not read the book before buying this, i never would have read the book at all, as there was no useful information on it.there is SO much to learn in the books!thus, i recommend someone purchase the entire book, or the entire unabridged edition cd, and not this shortened set."
1,"Write a book about what people already believe, make $$$$$$$","Pop psychology at its worst. Mr. Gray (he purchased his Ph.D. from a mail-order university so I will not call him Dr.) basically makes a compilation of every stupid stereotype about men and women (true or not) and than passes it off as an original work. I could've gotten the same info from talking to a frat/sorority member! The worst part is that he claims that all these things are facts yet he doesn't once mention a source for these facts, or for his helpful hints (one doesn't even know if he's tried them aside from a few silly anecdotes, which may work for the people involved but are unlikely to help anyone else). If you really want to find out about sex differences (if any exist...) take a social psychology course!"
4,A lot of what the books says is true!,"A man takes pride in feeling competent, in being trusted, and in being respected by his mate/spouse. And when a woman corrects him, and nags him, and constantly tells him he's doing it wrong, a lot of what a man hears is: you're incompetent, I can't trust you even to do this simple task, and you don't do anything right. This book helped me, as a wife, stop harping on my husband so much. No, he doesn't always do things the way I would do them, but if I correct each and every thing he does wrong, he will: 1-stop trying to do things to help me out, and 2- feel like he has to ask permission or for instruction everytime he does the simplest task. I've seen men who have been so belittled by their wives that they are more like lapdogs instead of men, and that's not sexy!"
2,Ugh! Couldnt Make it past page 218,"I seriously kept trying to finish this book, but i could not handle the fact that it is the most REPETITIVE thing i have ever read in my life. He states the same thing in about a trillion different ways. I get the point after you tell me once. Each section is basically the same concept repeated over and over. Waste of time and money. Horrible read."
1,"If you don't finish the book, don't recommend it!","At least 5 people mentioned this book to me. None of them had finished it. And I can see why. It's poorly written. It's repitive. It's not worth reading through to the end.I'm the only person I know who has read the entire book. And that was a painful experience. There's not much worthwhile in the book. To summarize: men and women are different, view and see things differently, be aware of this when dealing with your spouse.That's all he wrote using the 'catchphrases' of Mars and Venus.To sum up the book - don't buy it - if anything take it out of the library. Then read any 2 chapters. The rest are all the same.And don't recommend this book to anyone if you don't read it entirely. You'll find that you won't be recommending it."
3,"Great Book, Horrible Digital Formatting","If you're looking for a book that helps to decode some of the mysteries that separate women from men, this book is a great start. It's not really what I would call an ""intellectual book,"" but a lot of the advice is good and very understandable. A very easy read, and I enjoyed it.The author does seem a little full of himself, but if you ignore that, a lot of the advice is solid. I don't know how easy it would be to implement versus read, but it'll definitely be an interesting experiment!So, I'd give the content four stars.The formatting for Kindle gets one star.Whoever formatted the book for Kindle did a HORRIBLE job. Most (if not all the ""charts"") are cut off and illegible. Since these charts are supposed to be helpful and practical examples that one can use in real life, this cuts out a good chunk of the useful advise offered by the author. Changing the direction of the text, and font sizes does not help. It almost made me want to get my money back."
1,Breaks more than it fixes,"I didn't read the book but my wife did. It caused way more problems in our relationship. Please be wary of it and take it for what it is, someone's opinions."
1,Amateurish psychobabble,"I pity the stupid woman who believes this and buys a copy for her spouse hoping for change. Not all guys are sweaty, beer-swilling, butt-scratching jocks from Mars. If you and your spouse have a problem, work it out, but don't expect any help from this book. MEN ARE FROM EARTH AND WOMEN ARE FROM EARTH... DEAL WITH IT!!!!!"
1,"3rd rate fiction, don't mistake it for fact!","This author is trying to pass some of his ungrounded, unscientific, unproven, PERSONAL FEELINGS as FACTS in his ""Mars vs. Venus"" series. I am lucky to have read many academic journals and books on gender studies to realize this author is laying FALSE claims ! Readers, don't get CHEATED!"
1,"John Gray has chutzpah, even if he doesn't have a PhD","Wow, this edition of ""Dr."" Gray's work was released even after his PhD has been debunked. And yet he still appears as ""John Gray, PhD"" on the cover of his book! He bought his PhD from a diploma mill. He's a fraud, a charlatan, a huckster.I'd like to think that after a man who rose to fame peddling himself as a relationship guru -- while using false credentials to bolster his claims -- would find himself humbled after his PhD was revealed to be a fraud. Apparently, John Gray lacks humility and basic human decency, as well as a PhD.What John Gray has is the ability to tell people what they want to hear. Maybe he should sell a diet & exercise book too, and tell us we can eat all the chocolate we want, and sit on our fat behinds while watching 7 hours of TV, followed by 5 hours in online chat rooms, and we'll get slim & trim by doing so!Sincerely,Madame Beige, PhD, B.S.A., XyZ, PdQ"
4,Men are from Mars,"Although since it came out in the early '90s it has achieved almost cult status, the book had never recommended itself to me. But I usually get stuck in reading jags, and sex has been the topic lately. This was one of the more obvious books to take up under the circumstances, and I must say, I wish I'd read it earlier. I certainly found myself and some of my relationships among the pages. I found the information very helpful in clearing up some of the causes of failed romances in the past. (I wish I could say I will learn from my mistakes but only time will tell). It was helpful also to learn that I am not especially unique in my state of confusion over or in my awkward efforts toward life and love."
3,Great title,"The title of the books just about sums it all up. Men and women are different. Some of the concepts explained are useful but overall the book is a little shallow on the ""how-to's"" of relating with the opposite sex. An excellent book my girlfriend bought me is THE ROMANTIC'S GUIDE. I guess it was a big hint from her."
5,Phenomenal!,"This has been such an eye opener for me. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone whether in a relationship or not or even if you'd like to be in one. For men and women, this book sheds light on why men and women behave the way they do. It's all about changing perspective and reaction rather than changing personality (the way you perceive vs. the way you are). It's about accepting and celebrating the difference between men and women. After reading many passages, I found myself saying, ""Oh my goodness, I can't believe I did that!""Buy it, read it, enjoy your partner better!"
2,Books by John Gottman are MUCH better.,"John Gottman's book, The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, which is based on years of solid research, is much, much, much better than this book by John Gray."
5,The BEST book I have EVER read!!!!,I fully recommend this book to EVERYONE. This book has made me feel like a whole new person from the second I read the first page. It really helps you UNDERSTAND yourself as well as your partner which in turn makes for a healthier relationship. All those times you tried to figure out WHY your partner acts the way they act will be answered. I have stopped trying to figure out my partner and instead I understand him and I have felt so much better knowing that it is not just ME or not just HIM it is just WOMEN and just MEN!!! This book will be worth every single penny!
2,Incomplete,"After reading MMWV, I read Susan Hamson's counterpoint, ""The Rebuttal from Uranus"" in ""Taking Sides: Human Sexuality, 6th ed."" by Francoeur and Taverner.I must say that Gray is incomplete without having a copy of Hamson nearby to refute (or at least temper) Gray's ""wisdom"".Plus, Francoeur and Taverner provide a lot of insight on other important sexuality issues. I recommend that everyone read Gray, but read him in Taking Sides."
1,Psychological blather,"I am angry with myself for spending time reading this drivel. Books like this and authors like Gray are part of the reason that American culture is an international embarrassment. Save your time and money, as insightful as an infomercial."
1,Don't bother,"The only thing this book taught me about relationships is to avoid like the plague any woman who owns a copy. Anyone stupid enough to think that the few simple rules, strategies and generalisations given here can help them understand 50% of the worlds population has their own problems before they even start getting into a relationship."
2,Take with a grain of salt,"""dr"" gray's PhD is actually in creative writing... which makes this book entertaining and easy to read but a bit simplistic in its concepts. As a woman, I found the men were given way too many buy outs for bad behaviour. Okay they are elastic bands, but doesn't recognizing a problem give you the responsibility of dealing with it yourself rather than saying ""I yam what I yam"" and expecting your partner to adjust themselves to you?"
1,"All marketing, no substance","Please! Gray has been repeating the obvious over and over for the past 6 or 7 years - men and women are different - and Americans keep lapping it up. I'm sure Gray's banker and publisher's accounting department take him seriously, but I can't fathom why anyone else should."
3,Good ideas that are repeated again and again and again,"By no means this is a good book that provides both men and women new sharp tools to have beautiful and promising relationships.The main drawback is that there are three or four main ideas that are repeated again and again... Probably with half pages it would be equally useful. There is no need for 20 examples that are exactly the same.Regards,"
5,A Classic!,"If you need to learn something about the opposite sex, this is the book for you! I'm amazed about how little we know about the opposite sex when I first read this book. First, it explains that men and women are really different (we all know that) but it further explains HOW they are different and this means that men and women deal with problems, stress, relationships, & pretty much everything else differently. It is when we know the difference will we be able to get a glimpse of the ""other side"" and get a fuller & better understanding of why some things are the way they are. It also gives us tips & solutions of how we can embrace this difference and deal with our partners and relationships the way they should be dealt with. No more walking around blind in our relationships. No wonder this book is a classic. Just great! A must have!"
3,Pinpoints some differences between men & women,"It points out some main differences beteen men and women, which helps you to look at your relationship from a new angle. The examples are repetitive, you can skip once you get the concepts."
5,Excellent book giving understanding,"I learnt a lot from this book, both about myself and about women. We can all learn from this (if we are willing and humble enough to learn) and improve our relationships, so long as we can also learn to not be selfish! Worth reading if you are dating, or looking, or about to get married, or already married AND willing to understand and change where necessary!"
1,If this is true ...,"According to the Rick Ross Institute research site: John Gray received a Ph.D. from California Pacific University, an institution that was shut down by the State of California's Attorney General's Office. Reason: A degree mill. California Pacific University was never accredited as an academic institution. Although accreditation does not mean that the theories isn't valuable, it does beg the question how credible it is in daily application."
1,"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus-CD","I am quite dissatified with this CD! When i put it into my cd player on my desk top, i only get all kinds of swirly lines, a mans voice and music. Is there suppose to be a live person on this cd or is it just to listen to and not view who is talking? I really do not like this cd if this is what is suppose to be! I don't even give it 1 star! I would much rather see live people or aanimated person than the said above that i see."
3,No answers here,"This books does an excellent job of explaining why Men act like such jerks and feel totally OK about their behavior and why women put up with it for so long before they finally snap. However, there is no advise for women in this other than being a doormat isn't enough, you need must also be a cheerful, sincere doormat."
2,Only two stars because someone took the time to write this!!,"I did not receive this book from amazon.com. Luckily I got it for free, because if I would've purchased this book I would have been pissed. This book does not apply to any relationship I know of. It is a total piece of crap! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! There are so many other relationship books out there, that actually are helpful, useful, and practical, this is not it."
3,obviously second-handed ...,"I like this book, but the paper seems to be a little bit too second-handed..not as new as described."
1,"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus: A Practical Guide for Improving Communication and Getting What You Want in Your Relatio",The book did not by any means meet my expectation. My boyfriend mentioned an extract from the book during one of our conversation and I thought it would be something spectacular in terms of learning new things.........but i was thoroughly disappointed. Very bland!!!!
5,WOMEN ARE FROM..?,"Fact is ladies don't get it, which is similar to the otehr book I recommend WHAT'S WRONG WITH BLACK WOMEN? by Monte Maddox. Anything someone goes negatiove against women, oh boy! Watch out! I love both of this texts, as they delve into areas that many of us (including women) do not want to deal with! BRAVO!"
4,Long Lost Best Reader Replaced,"I had this book years back and have longed to reread it. Library's in my rural area do not carry it. I found this book very enlightening, so entertaining and at the same time true to my path in this world. Thanks for the opportunity to own it again."
5,"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus","Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus created quite a stir when it was first written in 1992 because of the veracity of its information. Dr. Gray explained in vivid detail why it is that men and women just don't speak the same language and often misunderstand each other in relationships. After reading this book, it is obvious that men and women have completely different, and sometimes opposed, needs from their relationships. Any person interested in making their relationship better would benefit from reading this book with its practical and simple explanation of the opposite sex."
3,"Pretty basic, some great points, but over generalized","This books really covers some of the difficulties of generations where males and females did not try to become one another. In many cases the male is typified as being an ISTJ and the female as being the ENFP. This is not always the case, and a good portion, not all of it, is based upon these stereotypes."
4,good book,"this book is a good reminder of the differences between men and women. while i did not find a lot of the examples that way I think as a women. I have run into ladies I work with that use indirect communication. It was a good reminder in how to improve my communication with them and it was helpful in conversations with my partner...ie understand how he thinks. i would say even if you are not the typical person in this book, you can still learn good tips from it"
3,Gift for student,"Great gift for male students who perceive themselves as ""players"" . A great resource to teach young men how to treat women, a skill many lack."
1,Mars? Venus? Go Back Home!,"I feel like from different planet when I to read this book. English not hard, but little of book is to talk about space. No UFOs in the book, and I read to cover. Why is the point of this book, please to tell me. It not good for astronomer."
1,Stereotypical Nonsense,"I flipped through this book while at my parents house. According to its definition of man being like a rubber band and woman being like a wave, I should have a penis and my boyfriend is from Venus. Also, his recommendations to women are the most painfully offensive condescending statements I have read in a long time. ""What to do with when you hubby retreats and doesn't want to talk? How about a nice bubble bath!"" John Gray is a sick man."
5,A problem solver,"Bought the book after my last breakup. I was so fed-up with not knowing where the problem was. Fighting about nothing and making her upset even though all my intentions were good. I had no clue why we were fighting. I wanted to do something about it, read a few pages of this book and then bought it myself.Great book, very stereotypical but everything fits in how I used to think. Never knew I was such an typical Man. :) Its primary focus is explaining our differences and it does it very good. Now I know why women are not logical, and why she is upset for no reason. :)It also gives a method for dealing with your inner issues and feelings. Stuff you might not know you have until someone points them out.The book goes both ways, helping both men and women.They should teach this in school!"
1,Wish I could give it ZERO stars. Run away! Run away!,"If this book is true, it is a miracle men & women stay together long enough to perpetuate the race.This book is repugnant and redundant. Gray's view of most people's emotional lives is extremely shallow. Because I believe that there are all kinds of people in the world, I can believe that there are a few people that it might help. But I sure as HELL wouldn't want to be one of those people, or be married to one of those people!Go read a real relationship book by someone who has an actual clue, like John Gottman, Ph.D."
4,A must read!,"If you are a man, you need to read/hear this book.If you are a woman, you need to read/hear this book! Maybe even more!I read it 6 years ago and last week I listened to the cd. John Grays insite into how men and women think is amazing.I would say he hit's the nail on the head with everythign he says. Best of all, it makes you think and want to take action. Once you understand what the opposit sex needs, it's easier to give them what they need. Great CD's.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because John Grays reading of the story. I wanted to hear more excitement & feeling in his voice. I thought it was a bit to monotone. Really, this is a 5 star CD. Highly recommended."
3,An Ideal Relationship,"In many of the chapters the facts were diluted by John Gray's opinions. Many of the experiences were between John and his wife. This made the book very personalized and hard to apply into my own life. Many of chapters based on womens moods or mens manlyness are based on the indivisual. This also makes it hard to apply to your wife or girlfriend.This book is probably best for married couples. Though I am not married some of the chapters helped me understand how a typical woman would react to certain events. The points made are all very strong and are able to strengthen one's relationship if practiced properly. It is impossible to miss any of the points made because of the repition that John Gray uses. This caused me often times to skim the chapter instead of fully reading through it. Though many of the points were diluted by his opinion, all of them had a hint of truth in them."
2,Spend your money on another book,"Yes Gray did make some points but about men and women in relationships, but these points are- 1- Already rehashed ten different ways 2- Can be applied to either sex 3- And finaly this guy is stuck on how smart he thinks he is."
1,Zero help,"The book should be called, ""Men are whiney, delicate little things and women should bend over backwards to give them their space."" I agree that the differences in men and women should be an open subject between them and that each partner should try to understand and make allowances for the others moods, I just found the book focused a little too much on men's ""cave dwelling"" and how women should ""go shopping"" or ""talk to a friend on the phone"" until the man decides to come back out of his cave. Please!"
3,A good book but nothing special,"There are some good points. For example, women want a shoulder to lean on with someone to listen to them and not a quick answer to their problems. Also, I thought that the love letters was an excellent suggestion in communication. However, I thought that there was an overtone of woman bashing. For example, women want to give unsolicited advice. Ok, fine, what is wrong with that? Simply recognize that the intent is to be helpful in a loving way. Why should the woman stop with this advice? Why should the woman be the one adjusting to all of these situations? There is very little, if any, requirements that the man do the adjusting. In summary, some very good points but most of which are common knowledge by now."
2,Something missing for me,"As far as sci-fi goes, we can all do better. I mean, the characters, the plot, the subplots -- what the heck happened? I'm sure that Gray was trying to mimic the slice of life aspect, but he rode that starcruiser too many darn light years for my liking. There was no ambiguous moral message like you find in Clarke's work, just a lot of obvious ones like you'd find in Bradbury's weaker work. I do feel a little more comfortable with my sexuality though, but at what price? I could have been re-reading my Piers Anthony books instead."
2,Taking Sides,"I had started reading MMWV, but found that chapter after chapter was a merely a rephrasing of the same thoughts.Do you believe Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus? Or do you believe the Rebuttal from Uranus?Both Gray's and Hamson's opposing positions are neatly (and concisely) summed up in this book, ""Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in Human Sexuality,"" by Francoeur and Taverner."
3,Not as great as I had hoped,"I was advised to read this by a professor during my study of marriage and couples counseling. The beginning of the book turned me off with is overly simplistic stereotyping, but as I kept reading I found some of the generalizations to be eye opening and fairly accurate. Unfortunately, by the end of the book Gray takes to pushing his other materials: books, audiotapes and seminars. All in all I think this book is probably worth reading (although I'd wait for the paperback), especially for the lay person. This books is probably particularly helpful for people who have little experience in psychology and who generally do not spend a lot of time thinking about relationships."
2,simple concept but long bks,simple concept but book over 300 page !page of less than 100 page is more than enough
1,Complete Hogwash,"This book is flawed in every way-- factually, logically, stylistically. I suppose you've got to read it, but you'll discover that it is junk."
3,took to long to get here,wanted to listen to the CD on a six week vacation. There were 10 days from the time I was told the CD was mailed till I left on vacation. The CD did not arrive in those 10 days.
1,WORST BOOK EVER,if you want to solve your problems speak with each other. when me or my wife have a problem we just speak it out don't waist money on this book it woun't help you at all.
3,It's only a popular book. Relax.,"This book is just advice. Take it if it applies to you, leave it if it does not. Stop all of the misogynistic bickering. It's just a book that a lot of people bought. I thought it was okay, nothing to get too excited about. No advice book should raise such harsh criticism. If all of the naysayers on this review list think that they are so different and proper than why don't they get out their pad and pen and write their own best seller. Then a whole new group of ready to be offended people can come in and rip things up."
4,Good,"Good, very informative. It helped me to understand alot about myself, and also about my wife. I would recommend the book for any couple or someone wishing to get married soon or understand more about the other gender"
5,Great read,"My son was given the choice of a few books for a project and I chose this for him. He was skeptical, but after he read it, said it was really, really good. You'll enjoy it!"
4,Great Book..,This book should be read by both people in the relationship. It provides great insight to how the male and female respond to different circumstances. It will give you a better understanding of each other.
5,This book reveals the secret thoughts men and women.,"This book includes men and women's most intimate thoughts about love, life, and sex. I feel that this book shows men's true colors. Being a woman myself, this book helped me to understand what men are really thinking. Not only has this book helped my relationship, it has inspired me to take more control of my life."
2,"Ok for some basic general insights,","It was helpful in giving some general insights, but forgets that not ALL men are the same and react the same and not ALL women are the same are react the same. They dont take into account that as individuals we have different temperments and characters that are not gender related. It was like they are trying to offer a quick fix band-aid."
3,Raised some good points but gets awfully carried away ...,"I thought that he truly did make some interesting and valid points which gave me, as a woman, fresh insights into many communications problems with men in both the personal and professional arenas. However, I also found myself thinking that a lot of the traits and behaviors he described as masculine applied to me more than to the men I've known, and vice versa. That in itself was okay. I understand that his theories are obviously and understandably generalized. It's when he starts elaborating and expounding and repeating that it begins to get a little ridiculous. The ""men are like rubber bands"" and ""women are like waves"" metaphors really began to get on my nerves, if not a little seasick. My goodness, how will any couple ever get their timing right so that they're there for each other when they need it?"
1,John Gray: Phony Ph d.,"John Gray's babble about the differences between men and women stinks up a storm, and it's best relegated to the field of pop psychology, not actual men-women relationships.John's Ph.d is a fraud. If you don't believe me, then do an internet search on ""John Gray phony Ph.d"". You will get tons or articles pointing to the fact that he received his doctorate from the defunct university called Columbia Pacific University, which gave out degrees like they were going out of style for doing nothing.It's not surprising that John Gray was as popular as he was in the 1990s decade. The yuppies seemed to flock to him like flies on fresh cow manure. But then again, yuppies have never been known as progressively-minded people. They flock to whatever trend is promoted by the media, like buying things you can't afford.Hope this helps!"
1,Wrong and damaging,"I'm not one to usually say ""me too"", but I wanted to just pile on with the other 1 stars to make sure people understand how wrong this book is.It offers advice of not being completely open and honest with your partner in order to maintain the relationship. If a relationship can't maintain honesty AND still be interesting it isn't a relationship.Talk it out, take the time to listen, and honestly attempt to understand your partner."
2,a step down for earth,"Having read the book before taking numerous communication classes at a creditible university. My opinion of the book has changed. Many people who rarely read communication books will welcome this book with open arms. For their limited knowledge of other method of saving or perserving a relationship. That is why there is a large gap in the ratings from 5 stars-1 star, you either hate it or you love it. I believe most of the people who have rated this book 1 star have done their homework and feel that this book was just a bunch of bull. Because he does not complete the communication process and comes up with very few new ideas. For those that are extremely pleased with this book please read some other books listed here cause you will find that the study of communication is fasinating, and there are even more tools out there that not only helps you understand your partner, but also maintains your relationship. Don't just read one book."
1,Self-absorbed males get excused again!,"If all you want to learn is how to tolerate the self-absorbed male you live with, have at it! Yet another in a long line of books designed to convince females that it's okay if he's an oafish, selfish, non-communicative fixture who believes the only needs that count are his own. So he's in his cave again? Surely you can take care of all the problems that crop up in a household, by yourself, because he needs his cave-time. Hog wash! When women get equal cave-time, communication problems will resolve themselves. Meantime, don't waste your money on this sexist tripe."
4,Overhyped but still helpful,"I can understand why so many people find this book rather annoying. The title is a bit cutesy, it has the same media-hyped, undeserved popularity of teenybopper pop groups, it has spawned a whole cottage industry, and people usually don't levy that much trust on pop-psych books, anyway, especially if they are in trade paperback form. This books is just so easy to make fun of. But it isn't all cheese. MAFM,WAFV will at least help you remember that there ARE fundamental differences between most men and women (as indeed there are between all human beings), an important thing to keep in mind when you can't understand why your partner is being so incredibly dense. And it will help you understand the basic differences between men and women, even though it oversimplifies things a bit. Sure beats hauling out three thousand page psychology textbooks and taking a course when all you want to know is why your partner is being so obtuse."
1,Complete and utter Garbage,"""Dr."" Gray's bestseller is filled with unfair generalizations and gender biases that, in my opinion, should not even exist in today's society. Unfortunately, many people (including many of my close friends) have taken his advice to heart. Of course, that idea might just be by inbred ""caveman"" personality taken over again. YES, I'VE CHANGED MY MIND. ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO BECOME ONE WITH THE COUCH, DRINK BEER, AND WATCH SPORTS ALL DAY BECAUSE I KNOW MY PSYCHOTIC WIFE WILL LOVE ME NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS. MAYBE SHE'LL TAKE A NICE BUBBLE BATH TO RELAX WHILE SHE'S AT IT.I plan to either burn this book or sell it to some poor sap who thinks it will really make a difference."
1,Make that Zero stars!,"Please don't mistake John Gray for actual scholars in the field of communication, John Gottman, Ph.D., for example. Gray's doctorate degree is from an unacredited college. He has never been published in a scholarly journal. Gray has never participated in serious communication research of any sort. He appears on Oprah, but refuses to speak at universities where professors might ask him questions. John Gray can write what you want to read, and you might even relate to his depictions. If you feel you need to find out what all the fuss is about, then read this book, but read with caution. John Gray is far from qualified to be dispensing relationship advice."
2,The Other View,"I heard talk of an opposing viewpoint so I finally took up Susan Hamson's counterpoint, the ""Rebuttal from Uranus"" in TAKING SIDES/HUMAN SEXUALITY, 6e.Incredible!!At first view, the Mars and Venus metaphor seems to make good common sense. Hamson rips it to shreds and challenged me to question my assumptions.I feel like I have a brain again."
1,The popularity of this book scares me.,"Gray's theory could be summarized as this, ""Men, when faced with a problem are obsessed with solving the problem. Women, when faced with a problem become frustrated and overwhelmed and need to talk about the problem without having to deal with solutions. While this may be the case in some, even too many, women, it is not the response of a healthy intelligent woman."
3,VERY amateur writing,"This book is very difficult to read not because of the content or his perspective on men vs. women but because the writing is HORRIBLE. If I was the editor I would not have let this pass, I'm sorry if I was a 5th grade teacher I would not let this pass! Like others said he is overly repetitive (to the point of being painful to read), obviously is not creative or a good writer because he can't think of different ways to explain the same concept. While I don't disagree with most of his viewpoints on how to deal with the opposite gender (of course there are major generalizations so do read it with a grain of salt) I'm not sure I can continue reading it simply because of the writing"
3,A bit too repetative and simplifying,"John Greys book was recommendet to me by a good friend. Grey is right in the thesis that women and men feel and think differently. After all the book helps to calm down a bit when she or he reacts in a way oneself won't expect. While leading me to some ""aha... and oh i see"" reactions Grey tends to simplify a bit too much for my taste and is often repetative which started to annoy me from time to time. I rate it a 3 stars - worth reading but don't take it like a literal guideline for your relationship. A healthy relationship means WORK, sometimes HARD WORK but it's worth it !!!"
1,Insulting sexist blather,"I was absolutely appalled at the blatant sexism of this book. It is nothing but a collection of tired old gender stereotypes. The only thing good that can be said about this book is that Gray is impartial; he insults both men and women equally. He focusses on the most superficial aspects of human behavior as if they were profound, innate, and of the greatest importance. According to ""Doctor"" Gray, the secret to having a successful relationship is to resign yourself to the fact that your partner is petty and shallow and always will be. This book gives people dangerously bad advice. There are plenty of good books available on relationship psychology by knowledgeable authors. Read them and avoid this book. It is worthless."
1,Don't believe it!,"If you read it, you are wasting your time to look for solutions of relationship. ""Are you the one for me"" is much better."
1,A question,"Reading this book, a question pops into my mind: According to Dr. Gray,the important point in a relationship is that women should give men some space in a relationship, by occupying themselves with bubblebaths.Now here is my question: IF the stereotypes about men and women in the book are true, and IF the solution is that men and women should behave accordingly, why are there already problems in relationship? There are many cavemen, and many needs women and those cavemen try to get their girlfriends/wives to back off, and I am sure some of those needy women are trying to be happy by themselves, out of desperation that their men won't treat them right. IF this is Dr Gray's expert solution, why hasn't this worked already? This seems like a recipe for disaster, rather than any relationship solution...."
4,found it interesting,"It was a great introduction to basic differences in the thought processes between men and woman without pointing or ""blaming"". I make it a practice to re-read this annually."
4,A very insightful book on probably the most common issue facing most of us...,"This book gives a very accurate picture of the communication issues in relationships. It also has good, implementable suggestions to improve things. However, I managed to read this through the end, for one reason only - the accuracy of the content. I think it could have been better written, to make it a more interesting reading. All the same, this is highly recommended, since it gives you good insights into the key aspect of any successful relationship - communication."
5,Good for hear that!,This book is very good to learn relationship.It is fun to hear and goodfor married coples!!
2,This Book Doesn't Work!,After reading this book I have come to the conclusion that it is backwards. While most dating and relationship books like this focus on understanding the differences between men and women I suggest one focuses on the similarities between the sexes by exploring universal laws of human behavior. Check out the book STUMBLING NAKED IN THE DARK. It simply makes more sense and it actually works!
3,Why Not?,"Men Are From Mars.."" is similar to most self-help writings in that it must not simply be read as a novel and discarded. Doing so will produce no benefit to the reader whatsoever. Don't bother with MAFM if searching for short-term miracles. The astute reader will take notes and refer back to them from time to time. (S)he should expect no immediate, glossy results. Was this reviewer helped by MAFM? Ask me a year or two from now. One particular nugget: 90% of what we believe is bothering us is caused by an incident from the past, not the current crisis itself. Another: ""Would you"" beats ""Could you"". Get the picture? What do we have to lose?"
2,Mostly fluff. Spend an hour reading just the chapter titles,"This book makes about two or three good points. Not enough volume for a bestseller, so he pads it with hundreds of pages of really annoying cutesie talk about ""life on Mars"" and ""life on Venus"". Could be mildly useful, and you can get through it in an hour by just reading the inset text and chapter/section headings and not have missed anything."
4,You can't go wrong with this one!,"If you're a fan of bands like the Muffs, Buck, racecar, red dye #5 and the late-lamented Cub, you'll dig this record. Quick, razor-sharp bursts of pop explode from the speakers--particularly good is ""Shut Up Now,"" which rocks hard without ever losing sight of its ultra-listenable pop center."
4,livin it,"This is a great tool to use in reaching young people today. Stephen Baldwin has truely followed the passion he has to relate to our youth.BrianSt. Louis, MO"
2,Livin' a lie,"Growing up in a conservative Baptist home, it was through music and skateboarding that I found my refuge away from religion. Though there is some great skating and BMX footage, I can't help but feel disgusted that my culture is being used as a promotional tool for the same kind of dogmatic nonsense I was trying to get away from. Stephen Baldwin is much like a missionary. Missionaries believe they do good, and in a sense they do when they aim to nurture and care for those who need caring. But they also simultaneously inject their Biblical BS into their works."
1,"Banal, boring and undercooked","This book, one more in a continuation of the Emma Harte saga proves that it's difficult to create an encore that rivals the performance of the wonderful 'A Woman of Substance'. This book had too many characters, storylines and insufficient detail. I had the feeling the writing was rushed, written too quickly to get it to press and not enough time was taken to give both the characters and storyline the depth that Emma's descendants deserve and that was originally created in the first book. I thought the twin tower replay was in poor taste and was both overdramatized and underutilized in the story line. This book was, in short, boring and disappointing. A pity, because so much more could have been done with this series, as I have found that each successive book is rather lackluster."
2,Unexpected is right!,"I am only half way through it and am struggling. I feel as if she loaned her name out to a new author or something. There is alot of repetition in the book and the characters are lifeless. Mind you, I couldn't write a book but I sure know what I like to read. I have read all the other books about Emma Harte but I loved them but if I have to read one more time about Emma's philosophy, which is repeated alot in this book, I might scream. I will get to the end but I certainly will think twice about getting the next one."
2,Ho Hum,"I did finish the book, so I guess it wasn't all that bad, but it didn't seem to have much purpose and it wasn't that entertaining or interesting. Despite the list of 'characters' at the beginning of the book, there are simply to many folks and generations to keep track of. Usually I like this type of book, this one was disappointing."
4,nancy w,I have read everything Mrs Bradford has ever written and the Hart family are my favorite. The first is the best and is listed as my favorite of all time books. The saga continues. I hope it never ends.
4,Unexpected Blessings,I cannot review the book because it was a christmas gift.But I can tell you that Amazon does a outstanding job filling ordersand the service and follow up is just fantastic...good Job....
3,No Solution to the Murder,"UNEXPECTED BLESSINGS by Barbara Taylor Bradford continues the sage of Emma Harte's family, but leaves the reader in a quandary as a murder is left unsolved at the end. Does this mean there is to be a sixth book in the series or is murder unimportant to the story line.Linnet has struggle all her life to win the reins of the Harte empire from her mother Paula (Emma Harte's granddaughter) and have a peaceful relationship with her sister Tessa. Are the two goals compatible within the confines of this ambitious family?A good visit with old friends, but it doesn't have the punch of prior installments.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
1,In very poor taste,I agree with other reviewers that this well is dry and the family is no longer interesting. But that disappointment is mild compared to the disgust I felt that she used the Twin Towers tragedy to plump up her character's adventures. First time I'd seen our national tradedy experienced by fictional characters and it is in very poor taste and so lacking in sensitivity that I won't read her again.
3,Unexpected Blessings,"TOO WORDY. WHILE TELLING A STORY ONE FORGETS THE ""PLOT"" LINESOUNDS LIKE REPEAT OF PREVIOUS BOOKS. WILL NOT BUY ANYMORE OF HER BOOKS."
1,Too many characters,"I really should not be reviewing this book as I quit reading it after the first chapter. There were simply too many characters to keep straight. The list of family members preceding the start of the book lists 57 members. I started with good intentions, but by page 9 I was thinking . . . who cares about all of these rich, beautiful people."
3,Good but not exciting,It is OK but not as interesting as the 1st couple in the series. Needs more action and excitement loke the 1st novel in the series.
5,LOVE the rug!,"The rug is extremely soft, has not frayed or come apart at all - we have two cats pawing at it. It is easy to spot clean and it also stays in place! Our son will carry it from his room to the kitchen and move other throw rugs we have in place out of the way, so his can go under foot. It is a wonderful product and he enjoys it!"
5,excellent book,"Who Loves You Like This is a powerful, moving account of a woman's experience during World War II and the years just after it, covering her life in Eastern Europe, in a concentration camp, and in Israel."
1,This game sucks,"If you are a serious hockey fan stay away from this game. This game absolutely sucks. The controls make you feel like a robot and the passing is absolutely horrible. Sometimes the computer makes the game feel like keepaway (impossible to do for the user). The checks are just plain stupid, because they are so overpowering. For example, when you get to the goal everyone crowds and tries knocking you over as hard as possible. The game really sucks. Graphics look like 16 bit graphics. If you seriously want a good hockey game, go get NHL 2K6 or NHL 2K5 (I really loved 2K5). Stay away from this one. You've been warned."
3,Air Force Band,This is a free CD provided by the US Air Force paid for by our tax dollars and they clearly say on the booklet that they are NOT for sale.
2,Biased and dated,"This book is extremely biased and dated. The research was done in 1980. Many of the scenarios may be interesting historically, but are not a relevant critique in todays age."
5,Just starting out,"I've really just started out with this camera, so my rating at the moment is based on the ease of use. It's incredibly easy to get up and running in no time at all. All the controls are easy to reach and understand, and the video quality is very good. The only problems I've had was the first time I attempted to hook it up to my computer through the FireWire. It took Windows ME a long time to ""install"" the camera, but once it did, it took next to nothing to download the video in Windows Moviemaker. I'll be exploring other software soon. I'll update this review when I'm more familiar with the camera, but for beginners like me, I think this is a great choice."
4,Uses same batteries as JVC DVL500U,"As stated in an earlier review, you will have virtually no luck finding batteries under the RCA listing. However this camera is able to use all batteries compatible with the JVC DVL500U. (I believe that this camera is actually built by them.)Haven't had it long enough to make any detailed comments. So far so good. I have been succesful transferring files/videos via 1394 to a PC running Sonic Fusion Video Factory. However, I did not have success using Ulead Video Studio that wasa bundled with my 1394 I/O card. (I believe that this is a problem with the Ulead software, not the camera however.)"
2,Good camera if you don't have a problem.,"Got this camera 3 weeks ago. The first moment I used it I realazied that some thing is wrong, I could hear the motors inside, the are loud and every the noise got recorded on the tape. Conntacted RCA and they refferd me to a repair center. After 2 days the repair center called me back saying that the camera is fixed. Picked the camera and gess what? same noise, nothing has been fixed. The guy said that they ""cleaned"" and the sound seems to be lower... what a joke. Since I wasn't happy they said that they will contact RCA and order parts, that will take 3 weeks. I can't return the camera since I purched it from uBid - another misstake..."
3,PC connection??,"This camcorder seems to work great, and the price is unbeatable. The problem that I have been having is that I have not been able to get it to work on my PC. I've tried two different firewire card, on 2 different PCs, and it just will not work. RCA customer service were terrible, totally clueless. I pluged it into a mac at work, and it seemed to work fine. Anyone got any ideas?"
3,Worked great for a while,"I purchased this camera in July 2001 and generally it has worked very well. It took great movies and I had no trouble connecting it to my firewire card to download movies. However, since we purchased it we received intermittant e04 errors that we could not always correct by resetting the camera. The RCA website is no help, in fact it will not even allow you to register a camcorder as a product! Overall the it did take great movies, however I have been very dissatisfied with the camera's reliability and with RCA's support of it."
1,Don't Buy RCA ...,I purchased this camcorder a few months ago from Amazon. The camcorder all of sudden stopped playing the tapes. We received [an] estimate to get fix the problem with no guarantees that this new part will be long term fix....
4,Having PC Problems.,The cc9370 is the first large ticket item that I have paid for ... and it was worth every dollar. I am trying to glean information from everywhere about connecting this thing to my PC. I have a Legend PCI Firewire card and my machine is running an early version of Windows 98. Does anyone know if I need Win 98 SE or Windows ME or better? This is my suspicion because Windows has no problems with my Firewire card and it sees the camcorder when I plug it in. It just asks for a driver named 1394/A02D&10001 If anyone has info on the OS needed to run this camcorder please email me. Thank You!
3,Firewire problems,"Firewire worked great for about three months, tried touse it today and no output.I am truly disappointed because that is the one featureI used the most with Adaptec Firewire card.I will talk to RCA on Monday to see if they can help me,Otherwise I will post the pictures of me burning it on my BBQand eating it ....[money] down the drain!!!!!"
3,good but not great,"I own all of this German series of chill out CDs, and unfortunately this one is the worst. I suppose there are great expectations in a series as good as this, but I think they started going in the wrong direction with their song selection. There are many great tracks, and artists like Kinobe & Morcheeba are as good as anybody, but I thought this had too many non-chillout songs. It seemed that many of them didn't fit in with the genre, so I just couldn't get into this one as much as the other 3. It is still a great album when you compare it to the other chill out CDs you see in stores, but I'm not sure if it's worth $40. The other 3 in the series are vastly better, so try those out instead. Maybe I'm biased because I like the darker, more electronic sounds, but I would recommend this only to hard-core electronica fans."
5,"Perfect bed for a Little girl""s Danica patrick themed bedroom!","I don't know why this bed isn't more mass produced anymore? as far as I have researched it's the most popular bed color little tikes has made, yet currently as of mid 2011, Walmart is the only place selling it. Can't even get it direct from little tikes. This bed is awesome for my little girl's Danica Patrick themed bedroom, it just ties the room together. Yes be careful with the screws, don't over do it. and I do plan on getting a piece of plywood later on to cover the wood supports. but this bed was easy to put together, even with two little helpers!"
5,Outstanding! A true reference standard DVD,"I ordered this DVD as the Studio was deciding to stop producing. I could not be happier. You must get a copy. My children marvel at the depth and color in every sceen. This is now my reference DVD. If you have a true media room with accurate equipment this DVD will not let you down. As I said earlier, You must get a copy!"
2,Beware - tips way too easily!!!!,"My mother in law bought this for my 14 month old son based on the positive reviews. My son is a strong walker but as with any pushing toy it should be able to withstand some counter pressure. This mower is so back heavy that it falls very easily and in one instance caught my sons fingers underneath as he fell with it. This has been the only toy whether pusher or other that has actually hurt him, leaving both his Grandmother and I very wary of why it was rated so well. It tips at the slightest pressure and if I put one finger on the handle it falls backwards. My son has great balance and isn't being rough but simply trying to use it. In my book playing with any toy that ends in tears is not only a bad toy but has serious design flaws.The only reason I rated it a 2 is because he loves the idea and the fun popping sound. So... fun concept but definite need for improvement."
5,Great fun and it lasts the years,We bought this for our 18 month old son and he still plays with it at four years old. Every time we cut the real grass he joins in. The product is very durable and there are no small parts to lose. No batteries either to worry about. A classic.
1,Hard to push,"My daughter recieved this mower for her second birthday. She was excited about being able to ""help"" me cut the grass. I don't know if the handle is too tall or just at the wrong angle, but she is unable to push it on the grass. As soon as she would start pushing, the mower's back wheels would come off the ground and it would tip forward. She's three now, and still has trouble with it on the grass. I have watched our friend's children try it also, with the same result. The mower seems to be well made, but just hasn't seen much use. Not much fun pushing a lawn mower when your not on the lawn."
3,Not great for young walkers,"My son was an early walker and needed some toys he could stand behind and push through the house. I searched the aisles at Toys R Us and finally found this mower, purchased it and brought it home. This mower is heavily weighted in the back, so children that are unstable on their feet have great problems keeping this upright. Not only did my 10-month-old walker have problems, but his 15-month-old walking pal had problems with this as well. I'm sure by the time he's 2-or-3 years old it will be fine, but it is absolutely not for young ones that need the support in their early walking endeavors."
4,"Fun, in the right places!","My almost 2 year old loves this mower, but it can be impossible to push on grass that is not extremely short. He has more fun pushing it on the dirt and rocks than the grass. I have friends whose children have other mowers that are much more ""push friendly"" in all lengths of grass."
4,Fun way to be just like Dad,"Our little guy likes to push the mower when his Dad is mowing the lawn. A little cumbersome when he first started using it, but he's gotten used to how it moves."
4,Fun but noisy,"I bought this mower for my grandson who is 2. He played with it right away, running through the house ""mowing"". It is pretty noisy with the popping action which can get annoying for adults but kids love it. My 3 yr. old grandaughter tried to take the mower away from my grandson as he played. Seems to be really durable."
4,My son does everything but slep with it....,"I bought it for my 15 year old because I can't seem to get him to use the real &%((^_+^+ one.Actually my son is 3 and has had it for a year and I would bet he has pushed it for 20+ miles following me around the yard. If you have a toddler that likes ""bullbozers"" and ""dumpstrucks"" then this is your toy."
1,Gets no use!,"I am dissapointed and very surprised to say that this toy has not captured my boys interest at all. I've had it for a year,and the boys are now 2 1/2 and 3 1/2. I thought it would be a huge hit, but it has just sat gathering dust. It is very sturdy and has great eye appeal like all Little Tikes toys. My personal complaint is that I think it is VERY noisy-perhaps this is what makes it so unappealing to my children. My kids have loved push toys of all kinds (even a doll stroller!), but this mower has been a total flop in our household.(I had first tried the FP Bubble Mower-way to messy and very poor bubble output/ quickly returned.) At least I'll get a decent price for it's like new condition at a yard sale or as a donation. I'd suggest giving the mower a good trial run in the store and make your own opinion of the noise it makes before purchasing it. Recently while shopping at [a local store] my child was inseparable with a [less expensive] plastic mower-go figure!!"
5,Durable and Fun,"My son loves his lawnmower. We had to get him something to push, so he would stop stealing his sister's baby stroller! It seems really durable. It is a little loud, but what fun is a toy that isn't??!! The only problem that I can see with it, is that it is hard to push in longer grass, and it frustrates him. But, he likes it and I'm sure he will use it for a long time!"
5,worth every penny!,"My son got this at age 19 months and took to it immediately. We now ""mow the lawn"" to the park, around the block, and of course all around the house. It is extremely durable and never tips over while he is pushing it. He doesn't like walking places by himself (prefers to be carried, but now that he's 2 he weighs 31 lbs)...but if I let him bring the mower, he'll walk for blocks independently."
3,Beware...pictured item is NOT what is available,"Not only has the color changed again, this time to yellow & red, but there is no more ""confetti"" flying around the mulching compartment to view. Only a corn popper effect, which you can only see if you are in front of the mower!! This will cause you toddler to fall over as he leans forward to watch the balls. The item described/pictured was much better - and nobody warns you that a different item will ship."
5,So much fun!,"My grandson, who is 23 months, loves this lawnmower. Everytime he comes over, he says ""lawnmow"" & wants to go out & mow the lawn. Can also be played with inside if you don't mind the noise. This is well made & lots of fun!"
4,Aaron loves his little Tikes Mulching Mower,"We bought this for our grandson. He's almost two. He loves imitating his parents. He has a little vacuum, which he uses all over the house, so we thought he would really like this mower, and we were right. It seems durable and can be left out without worrying it will be damaged by moisture. It makes a popping sound when pushed, which he likes also."
4,Much loved toy,"Our grandson in GA has always liked to ""work in the yard"". This has already been and will contimue to be used constantly by him as well as his little sister and brother as they get bigger. His parents are not crazy about the noise it makes. The popping sound of the ""mulching"" is fairly loud."
5,Nice stylish watch,"I bought this for my wife a couple of weeks ago and she really loves it. The watchband is somewhat long so I had to purchase a cheap pin remover from Amazon (see my other reviews) to remove two links on either side of the band. If someone has a very small diameter pin punch they probably could do it without purchasing the tool. Otherwise no problems so far and she is happy with it, so I'm happy. The price is right!"
2,"Old fashioned, but cute","This is a very oldfashioned looking, ""luxury"" watch. The gold finish is nice, the face is nice, but there's nothing about this watch which warrant the stated retail price. For the sale price, though, it makes a nice gift for very occasional wear."
4,Hatful of Seuss,This book is great for children. I rated it 4 stars because I think the book is larger than it should be for children. The book has several stories in it and is rather thick. The stories are great for children learning to read on their own and learning rhyming.
4,"A good buy, but Six by Seuss is better","Two of the books collected here are classics (Sleep Book and The Sneetches) and the other three are also pretty good, so this is well worth buying. The now out-of-print ""Six by Seuss"" however, is an even better value, since it includes five of his very best stories (Yertle, Mulberry Street, the Grinch, the Lorax, and Horton Hatches the Egg) under one cover. I would recommend looking for that book first, then getting this if your child turns out to be a hardcore Seuss fan."
3,Vol. I Only,"Although the reproduction is well-done, unlike another digitally reproduced book I recently purchased from Amazon, it is only Volume One of O'Rorke's two-volume history. Vol. I concentrates on the town of Sligo and the Barony of Carbury, while the missing volume discusses Leyny, Corran, Tireragh, and Tirerril. Still, half a loaf is better than none."
4,Meditations,"I really like Louise Hay's Meditation early AM to late PM. It's is when I was in High School, but it still resonates with me. Louise Hay has an understanding of Meditation. You know, I often listen To Marianne Williamson's Meditation too, and that is a subsidery of Hay's Publishing. It's all very GOOD!"
3,Stihl .034,"Oregon 105671 Replacement Bar And Chain ComboThis chainsaw bar is fine for the Stihl..However you need to get the right chain pitch which is written on the outer clutch housing. This one comes with a .325..Chances are your .034 is a 3/8"" pitch this chain will not work, unless you have swapped out your clutch housing to .325"
5,Works great,"Stihl 028 super, bar and chain are as described and work great. I wish i had upgrade from my old 16"" bar years ago."
1,bar &chain not compatable with 032 stihl saw,the 74 link chain was not compatable with the drive gear on saw & the 18 inch bar
2,Useless,"I bought this sofa for my daughter who is very into Groovy Girls. She saw this and had to have it. She was very disappointed in it because the Groovy Girls cannot sit down in it. They just don't stay bent so that they can sit. The sofa is cute, but useless to her and it sits in a corner."
1,Not a good choice,The Mucha Lucha backpack is small and the zipper is very difficult to operate. The price was good and my son loves it but I don't think it is going to work well for school.
5,A must read,This book should be read by every young woman or girl. This book will be a good resource and allow a young woman to make the right choices and not end up in some dead end relationship or life.
2,"quite dissapointing, stopped reading after a few chapters","This book talks about how wrong it is to trick a man to have a baby so that a man will be stuck to you and your baby. I do not need to read a book to know it is a wrong thing to do. After that I stopped reading any farther. What a waist of my time. I am a financially secure Japanese software engineer. Maybe this book is catered toward a women with no job, no game, a type of women who sit around and watch these TV talk shows all day. The contents of this book is about the same level of these day time talk shows. I bought this book with high expectation. I was looking forwared to learning something. I was very dissapointed."
2,Duh! Use Common Sense!,"I checked this book out of the library because the title was intriguing... I'm 19 years old and I wanted to get good advice for my future. Well, I found the book ridiculous! Everything she wrote about was based on common sense! Honestly! I've always known that it is wrong to manipulate and trick someone into having a baby in order to create or maintain a relationship! All I can say is that I'm SO glad that I did not purchase this book. It would have been a definate waste of money."
1,HARMFUL TO WOMEN,"I read this book years ago and I was absolutely appalled and insulted. She treats women like they are absolute idiots! If you are open minded this book is NOT for you, if you are easily swayed then good luck... you may become one of Dr. Laura Schlessinger's drones."
3,not very deep,"It does not have much depth. It basically tells you one thing: as a woman, be independent, do not mentally(emphasis of the book) or economically rely on men. I do not think I learned much by reading the book. Some case stories are interesting but I would expect more depth in explaning why this is so and why this is not so.But if you are upset or depressed because a man rejected you or something like that, this book may help you feel better because you will know that it does not just happen to you becuase there are so many other more unfortunate women."
3,"Boring read, Didn't apply to alot of people reading it.","I found this book hard to read & had to make myself keep reading. I didn't feel she was referring to me or my husband, I don't think that if you don't have problems then this is not a good book for you to read. I find some of the women she refers to as stupid women, a disgrace of womanhood."
5,The best,Things you know but you wont apply until you read this book. It is going to change your life
4,someone is retarded,"i havent actually read this book, although i plan to. i would just like to say that mike rotch, the retard a few comments down, really should learn how to speak/write english before he knocks a book.i could not for the life of me understand what the hell he is talking about. sneezing? from a book? issues man, issues.hmmm, will he ever be published? a resounding no."
1,Mysogynistic text,"Laura Schlessinger skewers her own sex in this surprisingly dull tome. Painting all women with the same broad brush, she presumes to inform females of their multiple failings. Fans of her show will love this book."
3,"take the good, leave the bad","There is a lot of good information in this book, but in my opinion, it isn't always presented in the best way. Dr Laura is a jerk sometimes and that is not helpful. Was hoping for a little more understanding from somebody who has apparently been there. Instead, she comes across as ""my situation failed because it was different.""Still, if you can get around her bad attitude and huge ego, I think there is a lot of good information here. You are in the situation you're in because you want to be. There are options, even though it may appear there are none. We all have options."
1,Read For Women's Psychology Class,"I had to read and review this book for my Women's Psychology class. It was so hard for me to even read the whole thing. I was so upset with much of what she was writing. I don't understand how many women could take what she was saying and not honestly get offended. Also from my understaning she is not even a true psychologist/therapist. I would not reccomned people reading this, and I know for a fact that when I am practing therapy myself I will NOT be telling my clients about things from this book. I wish women out there luck with finding something that is good self help for them and doing what works, but in my honest opinion I don't think this should be it."
3,"Dee Lundgren, Bucks County PA Licenced Professional Counselor","Like her typical nononsense approach Dr. Laura she doesn't hold back when pointing out what woman commonly do to ruin their lives. As I read through this book I can totally agree that I counsel smart educated women that when it comes to men get involved with obvious losers. However, the book doesn't give enough attention as to why women do this and what to do about it. The obvious is pointed out but I did not find the book motivating."
5,Great advice for Women!,"Again, in this book Dr. Laura doesn't talk around the issues; instead she's right to the point. Some advice may sound tough, and perhaps it is, but it's helpful advice based on keen insight. This is a great book for us ladies and I think it will help especially all married women. Another book that I highly recommend as it is so very helpful, and which has been written by a man who is frequently assigned the title of Dr. Laura's twin brother, is Dietmar Scherf's ""I Love Me: Avoiding & Overcoming Depression."""
4,Real honest book,Still reading book at this time; some of the information is very honest and forces you to look at yourself and some of stupid stuff woman fall into and how to avoid ths situation all together.
4,All too true...,"It's one woman's opinion for sure, but very true. Young women should read this long before they get involved with anyone at all.Anyone would come away from reading this book a whole lot wiser."
3,good,"i read 10 stupid things couples do to mess up their relationships and thought it was awesome, when I read this I felt like duh? maybe it just didn't apply to me as at the time I was looking for answers to why I wasn't happy and it just wasn't in this book. a lot of the things she says are really really obvious I cant imagine any girl is that stupid, like sleeping with a guy and all of his friends. or looking like crap every time they go out, or being the guy's servant, ie. being available 24/7 without him giving anything in return, for me it was just eh"
2,Not So Great,"Some good information in this book; however, most of the book is common sense. I have read better books like this from the public library."
2,dr. know it all,I can't stand her. I shouldn't have even listed to the tapes! She's just a mean woman.
2,What was I thinking . . .,"Not sure what I was thinking when I bought this one. Haven't made the time to read it quite yet, so not sure if I will gain any knowledge from it. Hopefully some day I will be able to see what it is I have done so wrong!Product received as described."
1,ten stupid things women do to mess up their lives,this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha gas
5,Very insightful,"This is one of those rare books that have become incorporated into my personal philosophy. She holds a combination mirror/magnifying glass up to your behaviors and doesn't allow you to look away from what you see. I highly recommend this book for its content to any woman who, at the end of her life, doesn't want to look back on it with regret."
3,Good Book,This book is a must for any 20 some year old. Women need to understand how to be a strong individual before becoming a happy couple. I am making my 18 and 19 year old daughters read this book so they are aware of the common pitfalls that are out there.
5,History of Results,I bought Dr. Laura book in 2005 for my daughter and for my other two daughters in later years. I had each of them right a short essay on each of the 10 stupid things. Some of the points they found useful and some they did not agree and some they claimed they already knew. What I found interesting over the years is that they see what there friends are doing and point out behavior that is one of the ten stupid things women do. Being there father I know the difference between boys and men. This book helps women to see what a good man is and identify a weak useless boy.It is a great book that every young girl should read. For every father out there this is a must read for your daughter(s).
4,excellent book for young women,"I loved reading this book, having been a woman who's done almost all the stupid things mentioned! I bought the book to pass around to my daughter (21) and her friends.I love the easy to read format... a quick read which makes great points. My daughter doesn't want to read it! she says she wants to make her own mistakes! sigh! So maybe it defeats the purpose, as I find most of us don't understand these stupid things until after the event! self delusion seems to be what young women do best!! Anyway, I loved it! thanks"
3,Better for younger age women,I bought the cassette tape of this book. It was good but it really has several scenerios more for younger women than myself. I'm in my late 40's. There are several good messages and points regardless of age but I think it leans more towards the younger 20's crowd.
5,"Well, Duh! How stupid can you get?","As a father of daughter who SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, but can't get her to read it all I can say is Dr. Laura is 100% on track with this book. Now I guess I'll have to go read the book for guys to give equal time"
5,For Women Who Desperately Need ANY KIND of Man,"This book is written for women who need a shove or a kick in the a**. The book basically says, in my opinion: ""What are you doing to yourself"" -- and speaks to the woman who so desperately needs any kind of man (even if he's abusive) because she's lonely or filling a void in her lifespace with a body, and is completely ignorant in seeing the consequences of her action, in terms of hurting herself and maybe her children. This book is written for women who have no control over their lives and most especially themselves. Dr. Laura is right on. Her book will help those women to make healthy decisions.Yeah, this book is for those self-deprecating women."
5,Life changing,I bought this book for a good friend of mine and asked her to read it. She was able to see herself in so many of the situations that Dr. Laura addressed and is now making healthier choices in her dating life. I have known this friend for 15 years and she is currently in the first healthy relationship she has ever had.Thanks for writing this book.
4,Very good animation but confusing plot.,"Eternal Story is about a group of women in their late teens/early 20s who are part of the race of humanoids called the Solonoids. They are: Rumi, Lufi, Catty, Elusa, Rabby, Patty, and their 'droids Toil and Al (that is the way it all sounded, i'm not sure about spelling). They are a part of the 9th starbuilt project which has made a planet called Chaos, near Terra. However, the evil Paranoids will stop at nothing to kill them all and take Chaos for themselves."
4,Action Packed From Start to Finish,"The plot centers around a group of soldiers who are involved in a centuries-long war between two alien races. The story follows the group's escape from a fierce space battle and their subsequent bouts with the enemy as they make their retreat. This small story branches out into an even bigger story involving their enemy's motives behind their relentless pursuit and the origins of another ""alien"" race.This movie contains some really spectacular fight scenes and some neat gadgets too. It is the first movie in the ""Gall Force"" series and is probably the best."
3,Worth watch,"I enjoy watching Salman Khan's films very much because of his ability to portray the brave and romantic person who finds the woman he loves,in addition to the lovely songs,and the beautiful landscapes of India which are always present. Salman plays the role of Raju, a handsome young man who loves his childhood friend Juti and both them are determined to get married but they face some obstacles in their path when a prostitute and her ruthless brother interfere into the lives of Raju's sister and her wealthy husband who is Juti's older brother. The plot was written very well and it deserves 10 out 10 and of course,Bollywood always produces the best films that touch our souls and hearts."
3,Nice but not what I expected.,I love the voices of these wonderful singers but was disappointed that the CD's were somewhat boring. I don't think I would buy Libera again. I give 3 stars but really think 2 is more accurate.
5,Simply Beautiful,"A truly wonderful piece of music, this was the first of their albums that I purchased and it had me coming back for more, I now have all their work and recommend any of their music to those who would enjoy an uplifting and quite emotional musical experience. I especially loved ""Sanctus"" I'll never tire of that track. I've heard these melodious boys described as ""average"" but they are anything but. All I can say is that the harmonics of theses voices can not only be heard but also felt, like a chill up the spine and goosebumps across the skin, if that doesn't illustrate the point I don't know what can!"
4,A good choice for first time buyers of Libera,"A lot of reviewers have complained that Angel Voices is mostly a compilation that takes a few songs from each previous Libera album and reworks it. I imagine it is somewhat like a greatest hits, or favorites album, only all the songs have been re-recorded by the current set of boys that makes up the group.Personally, this album was our first exposure to the group. We enjoy its mellowness, and the soaring vocals and harmonies. I am not sure that we would buy many of their other albums since this one has a nice mix of songs that are included on the other CDs.We have given this CD as a gift as well as having it ourselves and everyone we have shared it with has loved it."
5,Libera CD - Angel Voices,The voices of these boys are so beautiful. I first heard them sing when I went to New York to see the Pope... they performed there. I love the CD and those voices are just magnificent!
3,New agey,"Nice boys choir, the kids are quite talented. Pleasant music. Nobody really stands out. I'll still take Jean Baptiste Maunier and ""The Chorus""--greater variety of works (especially if you catch one of the European recordings of the group in concert) and a soloist with a voice that will make you cry."
2,Censoring of Be Still My Soul,"On the fifth track, Be Still My Soul, the arrangers reworked the original lyrics of Katharina A. von Schlegel and taken the third verse:Be still, my soul:when dearest friends depart,And all is darkenedin the vale of tears,Then shalt thou better knowHis love, His heart,Who comes to soothethy sorrow and thy fears.Be still, my soul:thy Jesus can repayFrom His own fullnessall He takes away.And made it a combination of the third and second verse:Be still, my soul:when dearest friends depart,And all is darkenedin the vale of tears,Then shalt thou better knowHis love, His heart,Who comes to soothethy sorrow and thy fears.Be still, my soul,the waves and windsstill know His voiceWho ruled themwhile He dwelt below.In other words, they have taken the name of Jesus out of the original lyrics. The verse doesn't even make sense now. I feel it is awful that the one who can soothe all our sorrow and thy fears, Jesus, was censored from this beautiful work."
1,Disappointed customer,I ordered this bed for my 22 month old son. After receiving it my son and I put it together as a team. To my surprise it was not the bed I ordered. Trying to get a hold of customer service is almost as fustrating as receiving the wrong bed. It has now been 6 days and I have yet to receive a call back reguarding this situation. I highly recommend that you purchase a high priced item in person and trhough a company that returns calls. I will NEVER shop through amazon again.
5,More Than A One Time Read,"The book has eighty pages and is writen in a devotional style.

2,Water frequently runs continuously,"I'll add my vote to find another brand.Like many others, I've had the problem where it runs continuously after use.I installed a shutoff in the supply line under the sink, which is a pain.The TDS isn't as good as I would have hoped; the kettle ends up with a thin skin of hard water deposits after as little as a couple of weeks boiling perhaps 3-5 litres a day - perhaps 4 times as much as it used to take, but not the nearly zero TDS I expected.It broke my icemaker catastrophically - the output pressure was too low, and the icemaker value stuck open, filling the freezer with about 50 pounds of icicles which made it impossible to even remove the components. After I disconnected it, it took a couple of months for the icicles to sublimate (evaporate) so I could pull out the tray and clean it up."
2,Great for the first year...,"At first, this unit worked absolutely great - just as you would expect with great tasting, clear water. But after only a year it has developed a problem where 1 out of 10 times, the internal valve won't shut off and keeps wasting water from the drain line after the faucet is shut off. This is with 65psi line pressure and brand new pre/post fliters. In typical GE tradition and value, they have sold off their residential water division - so now customers are left with ZERO support on these units."
2,loud and wasteful,"I've had this for two years and it has been loud from day one. Ahh, day one, how I remember the grey hair. Installing was a real pain. The directions seem to be written for a professional, though it was indicated to me that installing would be easy. Far from it.The noise... it grugles really loudly through the air gap when ever I use it. Much more than is acceptable. Beware.Now, there is a syphoning problem. After usage I can often hear water running down the drain that does not stop until I turn off the water. Once I turn it back on I'm fine, but not prior. I replaced the filters, but not the membranes and that fixed it for a while. Now it is back to syphoning. I don't know if $200 worth of membranes will help but I really don't want to find out they don't!I will say that I'm very happy with the water quality though."
2,Not for everyone. Didn't pass the wife test.,"Pros: I used to have the more typical sears RO system but was frustrated by low capacity. I bought one of these last summer. It was great to be able to fill a 5 gal water jug in minutes instead of hours. Cool design.Cons: LOUD! The air-break in the spigot sounds like a jet engine. Because it is filtering so much more water per unit time than the low capacity systems, it sounds like you are pouring a bucket of water down the drain the entire time it is running. It has startled people in the next room when the ice maker goes off. Replacing filters is a $250 exercise. Mine lasted 9 months before the flow rate dropped to the point where it was no longer acceptable. Now it keeps turning on spontaneously with a trickle of water. It may be because of a bad valve or because the filers need replacing."
3,"Merlin Lacks Magic, it can't make water.","The ""Merlin"" reverse osmosis filter does the job. Our 'problem' with this filter, as in another brand we had before, is water waste. All these low pressure, below 90 PSI, filters, waste ten times more water then they produce.We know exactly, because we recycle light 'grey' water for toilet flushing. In water shortage regions , we are on a poorly producing well, I recomend spending an extra thousand for a small salt water desalination unit such as used on ocean going ships. Run THAT motor on 12V, solar and one has the purest fresh water, free.Desalinating 'fresh' water should be a snap with few if any, ""filter"" changes.With plenty of fresh water available, one could simply redirect ""Merlin's"" waste water for garden or other non drinking uses. In most regions of North America,GE Merlin Reverse Osmosis Drinking Water Systemclean drinking water will soon have more issues then Readers Digest."

4,LA meets Brazil,"I find Kleber to be one of the great modern composers in the Brazilian jazz realm. I've loved his music since I first heard it on Kevyn Lettau's early work, and this CD contains many beautiful samples of his compositions. The band is made up of largely LA studio players and Sergio Mendes Alum who have made a big contribution to what would be considered the modern Brazilian jazz sound. That sound can be a little polished at times, but it is always grooving and the band members seem to gel quite well. Most of the lyrics are in Portuguese, but that language is so beautiful and flows with the music so well that not understanding the lyrics is not a drawback, and in someways actually enhances the beauty of the music. These compositions can be a bit more challenging than the now familiar Jobim songbook, but the CD is well worth the effort, and gets better with each listening."
4,Holiday Purchase Of Cannon Camera,"Product itself was all I expected and delivery was quick and simple. However, I did not receive the camera case, battery or roll of film as advertised in description of product. No contact phone number given for supplier. I let it go because my time is more valuable than chasing supplier for missing items. Happy with primary product, but disappointed with supplier."
4,Excellent overview,"This is an excellent overview of the subject. Presents comprehensive information in plain and simple language. It didn't get the fifth star only because it lacks a bibliography. There are no references for someone who'd like to read further on the subject. Otherwise, recommended."
4,"Sensual, Funky, Hypnotic","I picked up this disc after hearing ""Sandpaper Kisses"" used as part of the soundtrack to a video game I was playing, believe it or not. After patiently completing the game (""Indigo Prophecy"") and lingering to see the credits, I purchased this album from amazon, and was not disappointed.A mixture of trance, soul/R&B;, rock and folk stylings, this album is such a relaxing, cool and mesmerizing experience, held together by Martina's breathless, almost childlike vocals and layers of music and effects pushing you into an altered state of mind. Great stuff, no matter what kind of music you like!"
4,Very Good,Great mix of styles. Soul Food is FANTASTIC! This CD is worth it just for that track alone. Now I wish I would have gotten the UK version though.
3,kids love it but what a backache,"so it may well be a HUGE hit with the kids but what a royal pain to change the sheets on this thing. Think I'm kidding? Try having to lift the entire mattress up every time you have to change the sheets. Takes 2 to change the sheets.But I give it a good review in spite because my son loved it. If you are getting it just beware and if you have a bad back, steer clear.Also you will have to stuff a few blankets in between the mattress and the frame otherwise a foot or leg will get stuck. Since we KNOW that all kids jump in the bed when you are not looking. The gap in between doesnt seem safe.Oh, and my son DID break his arm after he fell out of the bed walking on the side of it...but I can't fault the bed for that."
5,Medieval Family Camp,The family really enjoyed playing and acting out the stories of medieval times with this toy!
4,Amazing story of the men who fought WWII,"Danny Esposito, aka Abe Cohen, is a man hiding from his past. He's changed his identity and joined the army, in an effort to escape those who might want to find him. What he doesn't count on is the war. When the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, he finds himself sucked into the vast conflict. What he learns about himself and the world while fighting we change his destiny forever.Interweaving Danny/Abe's story with a detailed acounting of the fateful attack on the Rumanian oil fields at Ploesti, this story combines a gripping story of the terrors and triumphs of combat with one man's story of self-discovery. The descriptions of combat are detailed and utterly convincing, and provide the backdrop for Abe's growing realization that there is more to life than he's ever expected. As someone who has always been fascinated by the men and machines that made up the Army Air Forces in World War II, this story kept me engrossed from beginning to end."
3,One out of two didn't work,The first Walkman i bought just didn't work at all. The second one works fine.
3,"Button, Button, Who's Got the Button?","Have to echo the prior complaint about the less-than-easy battery change. Also, why can't the operating controls/buttons be larger? Or, at least, colored differently to help distinguish the various functions? My prior discman players had the buttons on top--bigger and easier to use. When this one dies, if they're still available (hate you IPod), I'll look for one with more user-friendly controls--even if I have to consider a non-Sony (Gasp!! Did I really say that?)."
2,Who designed this nonsense?,"I bought this to replace an iRiver player that received a fatal drop to the floor. I was sad to find that iRiver no longer makes CD players and began looking elsewhere. This device was not the correct place to look.Whoever decided that the battery compartment should be INSIDE, requiring the removal of the CD, was an idiot. And to make it worse, the battery compartment is near the hinge. If it had at least been placed near the outer edge, it would have been easier to remove and replace the batteries. On my dear departed iRiver unit, the battery compartment was on the back side. I could literally change batteries in the dark...with one hand if needed.The display is small, unlighted and hard to see.It plays fine and has adequate sound quality for me.Overall, I'm not happy with this unit and will continue to look for a logical replacement."
1,utter disappointment,I can't understand how Sony would have the nerve to sell a portable cd player that depletes the batteries within four hours. A total waste of money and loss of faith in the quality of Sony products.
3,Mixed feelings about my Walkman,"I use my Walkman as a stationary CD player in conjunction with a high end amplifier and speakers. It sits on a shelf in a cabinet. The button controls are all but recessed. There is no way to activate the controls by touch. They need to protroud and be individualized. Also, in contrast to an earlier model that has since died, it reverts to the spot on the CD where it was turned off the previous time, instead of starting to play from the beginning of track 1. It took time and patience to get tech support from SONY to find how to defeat this; it isn't stated in the printed instructions. And SONY tech support is hard to track down in the first place."
3,"Nice cd player,cheaply built .",The sound is good and its easy to carry around. The compartment for the batteries and earphones are very flimsy and could break easily. I like that it keeps your place when listening to books on tape.
3,Could be better,I do love this cd player except the buttons are very small and the batteries are very diffucult to remove. The sound is great and it does not skip.
4,perfect once it was opened,"I bought this CD player for my husband for Christmas, and was a little upset because the packaging looked somewhat battered, as if it had been on a shelf for a LONG time. However, it is indeed new and works perfectly."
4,Sony DEJ011 CD Walkman,"It does the job well for my purposes. I use it mainly when I walk, and haven't noticed any problems with music playback. I like it."
2,"First time, lasted 6 months; 2nd time, scratched my CD's","I've had two of these now. It plays well and sounds good at first. Then just when you think it's your trusted friend, it starts giving you trouble. The first one broke after six months. The second one put a knick in one of my CD's and scratched another to the point of being unplayable (i.e. you can see light through the scratch when you hold it up to the light), so now I will have to replace the CD. Fortunately the ruined CD is a disc I can replace relatively easily (the disc it ruined was ""Vortex"" by Amon Düül II in case you're wondering), but I'm still not happy about it; that's $14 I could have spent on something else. I should also mention that at least the second one has lasted about 9 months, so better, but come on now..."
5,walkman,got it for my Dad to walk with.He found it had too many buttons! He's 83 and can't see well. It kept gettign stuck on pause which frustrated him! When he had it working he LOVED it and couldn't believe it's great sound!
3,Teeney tiny buttons,"This item works OK, the only problem I have is the size and location of the operating buttons. Wearing bifocals, some things are harder to see than others. but I think that there are plenty of people who have great eyesight that would have a problem with this.I probably should have shopped for one that specialized in easy operation, and easy to read buttons for operation."
4,back to the 80's,"My local library has an extensive selection of books on CD so thought this would be a good investment. I have listened to three books so far on it and it really does work great. Not as convenient as an MP3 player, but loading all those CDs into my computer and then transferring them to my MP3 would be a big hassle."
2,Sony DEJO11 CD Walkman Portable Player,"Sony DEJ011 Portable CD player: The batteries are hard to install,and inside the case and requires the removal of the disc. The controls are hard to manipulate. I do not know whether it is the disc or player, but it often sticks on the sound, and requires moving the voices forward. Depending on how long the player lasts will determine whether I would consider buying another one, but I think I would purchase another brand."
4,Great to listen to my CD collection,I use the CD player to listen to my collection of CDs while I am on the treadmill. It works GREAT
5,EXCELLENT PORTABLE CD PLAYER,Reliable. Long-lasting. I especially like that the story restarted exactly where it was when I turned it off - not the case with less-expensive CD players.
3,CD WALKMAN,"This item is becoming a thing of the past, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. I am a fan of books on tape and now the new ones at the library are all on CD. The Sony Walkman, however, does skip at times and all of a sudden go back to the beginning of the story. This does not happen if I play the CD on my boom box or in the CD player in my car."
2,Sony portable CD player,it has not held up and easily was inferior to the older model I previously owned. I would not recommend it.
1,Poor Quality,"My walkman failed (sony) after a couple of years. It would not shuffle and would get stuck trying to play the next song. I purchased this one and after a couple of months the same thing happened. I tried various things as I thought it was the cd, but I realize now it is a design flaw with sony products. I had a cheaper cd palyer before not sure who from but it lasted waaaaayyyyyyy longer. Very disappointed indeed. Do not buy!"
2,Audiobook Warning!,"Warning! This cd player does not work with all audiobooks.I am a dedicated audio book listener and mostly usedmy ipod for audiobooks. However, I recently obtain someaudiobooks cds and decided to purchase a cd player,Unfortunately, although it played music cds well,it would not play the audiobooks at all! Message wasreceived no disc when attempting. This was to saythe least, very disappointing!"
1,Do not buy.,"Unfortunately, there are so few choices today for portable CD players that I bought one of these in spite of the terrible reviews. Quality control and poor design are legitimate problems here, I can confirm.I bought this as a gift and was testing it out beforehand, because of the bad reviews. Sure enough, my model had a problem where it would not detect that the lid was closed. If I squeezed the unit a certain way as I was closing the lid, I could get it to work sometimes. Pathetic. It's pretty bad when you know the thing isn't going to work before you even open the package. It was just a matter of finding out what the specific problem would be, and I found out immediately.There probably are some working units out there but who has the time or inclination to keep buying and returning them until you get a good one? Spare yourself the trouble."
4,Christine's review,"Can't beat a Sony product. I had a really old CD player, and I wanted the best, so I shelled out a couple extra bucks and it was worth it. Sound quality is spot on, the only thing is the headphones that come with it are not the best. But otherwise, another great product from Sony. Highly recommended."
3,Great So Far But BEWARE!!!!!,"I don't know how long it lasts but I've had it for about a month. I want everyone to know that this CD player WILL NOT PLAY ANY SCRATCHES WHAT SO EVER so if you don't take good care of your CD's you should either re-buy them or don't buy this CD player. Other than that, this player has been magnificent so far and I love it"
1,Disappointing,"I had an old cherry red Sony Walkman that worked great for years until it died. I thought it would be wise to spend a little extra money on a replacement, thinking it, too would last for awhile.In less than a year of owning it, the performance has deteriorated rapidly and the noise the player makes as it's getting ready to play has gotten worse. It is also very sensitive, and so skips or stops playing easily on disks that play without any issues on other players. Coupled with the horrible button design mentioned by other reviewers and obviously flimsy plastic construction, I would not recommend that anyone spend $40 on this player.I should add that I do not walk with this walkman, or use it as a personal cd player. It has a cushy life hooked up through my record player to a pair of speakers and plays the occasional CD (that friends bring over, or before I get around to importing it to my iPod)."
1,A Dud,"CD completely failed to play after approximately 5 hours.It was a Christmas gift and the recipeint had thrown out the original shipping material so he cannot send it back. Also, not worth the time and the two way shipping. Sometimes you lose."
1,Does not play MP3's,"Got it and now I need to return it. Won't play MP3's. It will play CD-R and CD-RW's cut as music and not data. It's not clear on the packaging nor in the manual. If you need to play MP3's, avoid this player."
4,"Good Price, Great Sound, But...","Good Price, Light weight, and Great Sound, but the battery compartment is located beneath the CD Tray. You need to remove your CD before opening the battery compartment. Changing the battery is not easy, especially for anyone with big fingers. The player's Lid will always get in your way. Also, the battery life is not quite impressive. I used to have Panasonic CD Player with the battery life 5X outlast this Sony. However, if you have small fingers and plenty of battery in stock, it worth buying."
4,Sony CD Player,"I purchased this for listening to books on tape. I mainly use it while doing yard work. The sound quality when used with my noise canceling headphones is fine. I keep it in the pocket of my shorts and it doesn't skip or jump. If I take a cd out and put it back in, it picks up exactly where it left off before removing the cd. The batteries last a long time and the player is easy to use. If you are looking for a rugged reliable product I would recommend the Sony."
3,Ease of Use,"In the past we have bought used CD players because the buttons are easier to use for my almost blind husband. However, they did not last long so I decided to buy this new one. So far he has not learned to use it."
5,walkman,"I HATE TO ADMIT IT, BUT I HAVE NOT USED IT YET! I AM SURE IT WILL BE AS GOOD AS ALL T'OTHER SONY PRODUCTS I HAVE BOUGHT."
2,Poorly Designed CD Player,"The controls and display on this Walkman are very poorly designed. The control buttons are difficult to find, and are overly sensitive to touch. It is difficult to handle the unit without inadvertently turning it off. The display is hard to see. The batteries are difficult to replace, and battery life is much shorter than my previous Sony. I can still remember when Sony made better quality products."
2,Cheap with tiny display and hard to see push buttons!,"Apparently, Sony has really gone downhill with many of their products. It used to be that Sony made products that last, with superior design and ergonomics. This CD player reeks 'cost cutting' and cheapness throughout. It's not made of anodized aluminum, but cheap plastic, and the display is tiny to read. Even the push buttons are tiny, and even though they are embossed, they have no coloring so you cannot readily see what function you are pressing, especially in low light."
2,Does not play MP3 cd's,I got this product for my mom who likes to listen classes on cd. Little I knew about them because most of them are burned as MP3. I focus on anti skip mode rather than reading it carefully. Otherwise its great. Headphones are flexible and plays beautifully.
3,Sony c.d. player hard to read !,I have many Sony products and they are fine. Now as for this c.d. player it's nice but for these cons. No instructions inside of package. I finally found them on the back of the plastic holder c.d. came in. They are at bottom and the print is VERY SMALL. Next the controls are very hard to read because of the tiny print. I would say if you really good vision and under forty years old then it would be a great item to use on excirsea .Dennis B.
2,CD Player,"The CD player had adequate sound capability, but my CDs were not new and apparently had some defects. I was not able to play through a single CD. The machine was returned."
1,This Walkman breaks if you breath on it,"I bought three of these on amazon. None of them lasted longer than a month before they began failing to load the CD properly and play it. The sound quality might be better but durability matters to for those who are mobile. The last one lasted less than a week before it stopped working, started making funny noises and failed to play the CD. Other cheaper brands are much more durable.This one is a piece of junk. A complete waste of money. Who wants to pay for something that lasts less than a month before breaking? I just bought my last Sony product."
5,Walkman Review,This is a great CD player and well worth the money. I use it when I walk and find that it doesn't skip or jump with motion. It has good sound quality. Delivery was prompt. I am very satisfied with the product and service from Amazon.
5,"Sleek look, long battery life","I use CD player mainly for listening to audio books, gone through 3 or 4 CD players in the past few years. In the past, I bought the cheapest ones out there, big mistake. Two AA batteries only last 3-4 CDs, with this Sony CD player, two batteries lasts more than 10 CDs."
3,Batteries,"I've only had this for 2 weeks and have already gone through 6 batteries, other than that I like it. I haven't played it that much so I can't understand what is going on with the batteries."
2,"Affordable, but Poorly Made","After several weeks with this player, I've come to the conclusion that this is a case of ""you get what you pay for"".On the plus side, the player is attractive, affordable, and not susceptible to mistracking while in motion.On the minus side, the sound is harsh and distorted on many CDs (even when not played at loud levels). The player goes through batteries too quickly. And, as mentioned by other reviewers, the display is too small; and the idiotic placement of the battery compartment makes changing batteries a chore.I would gladly pay twice as much to have a portable that sounds better and is more competently designed."
1,piece of junk,"I'm very disappointed in this. There are very few portable cd players on the market and I thought the Sony would be a good product. I'm old enough to have owned more than one Walkman and so I know they used to build durable electronics. I guess that's no longer the case. I bought this in late June 2008. As of December 2008, it will no longer play. It has never played well-skipping at times on cds that don't skip on my other players.I'm very disappointed and from now on will only buy cheapo cd players. At least then, I haven't spent 40 bucks on something that lasts 6 months."
1,Sony cd player,I'm disappointed in this cd player. I only have it a short time and it plays for a few minutes and then stops. It's useless and a waste of my money. You can't listen to something if it keeps stopping and then you have to shut it and start it again in a few minutes.
5,Walkman by Sony,Works great. I use it every day at the gym and around the house. It's the only personal CD player available that returns to the same place you left off when you turn it off in the middle of a book on CD.
2,Sony Walkman,"I really do not like this product. The buttons on the side are clumsy and not the best. I will buy my next Walkman with the buttons on the top and the battery inserts on the bottom. Not worth the money.The product, however got here quickly and efficiently. Nothing wrong with the mailing."
2,would not play,"The unit woulf not play my bible study cd's. They played on my old walkman but the new ones from sony would not work. Sony made a lame excuse and Amazon refunded my money and paid shipping to return them. Way to keep a customer,Amazon!"
3,A big disappointment,I've always liked Sony and will always consider buying their products. This particular product is a little disappointment. I bought it to use on the plane during a trip. The volume was not loud enough to hear my CD during the flight. Needless to say I was not able to use it for the purpose I purchased it for. Another disappointment was the labels for the controls. It was hard to read them because they were in black on black.I would not recommend it to anybody.
1,NICE WHILE IT LASTED -- 6 months!,"I bought this Sony CD player in July 2012. By December it was dead ... just quit, no warning. I tried using a CD cleaner disc, changing batteries several times. Nothing. I have had 2 Sony players previous to this one. The longevity has decreased from 5 yrs, to 2 years & now 6 months. Enough! No more Sony."
2,No charger,I had to go and buy a charger in addition to the player. Did not provide that info when we purchased the product
3,Walkman,I thought it would look newer because it was described as Like New and the volume is a bit soft.. not lowd enough.
1,Very disappointed,I have bought Sony Walkmans before and this one was horrible. The buttons are very small and putting in batteries is real difficult. I could barely get the old batteries out and I had to really force the new ones in. Also the player is draining the batteries at a very fast pace. I will go to Walmart or Target and try to buy a better player.PS I reviewed the instructions and there was very specific battery size- AA - LR6. I used generic AA batteries which may be my problem.
2,Skips songs sometimes,This CD Player skips songs sometimes if I were you I'd go with a different brand alltogether! Good luck if you decide to buy it.
1,No power!,"This does not come with an a/c adaptor. Maybe it is a fine CD player otherwise, but it is useless to me."
1,A narrowly hermeneutic account of language,"The author has a very particular point of view of what the study of language should be like, based on hermeneutics. From this basis, he fiercely criticizes what he calls the Chomskyan view of language. However, the ideas ascribed to Chomsky have little if anything to do with what Chomsky intends. For most of the ideas ascribed to Chomsky, no references are given, and as far as they are to be had at all, I guess they will all be from the 1960s. This is not a proper basis to criticize the Chomskyan view of language and certainly not in such a scornful, sour tone. The book really put me off."
3,Doesn't stand the test of time,"The mixer seems to be working well, but one of the speakers has completely crapped out on me, and sometimes I have to crank the volume in order to get one of the speaker outputs to start working. Granted, I've trucked this system around to various gigs, and it's given me plenty of good performances."
5,Left me a bit shocked...,"This was a well written book. No doubt about it, and the story itself was amazing. I read a lot and so generally, i can see when certain things are coming in stories that i read. This story through me for a serious loop. Not in a bad way at all, but in an ""aww man, i didn't even see that one coming kind of way."" I feel praise should go to the author for such a compelling plot, that i feel may people could probably even relate to. The lengths that we would go to to keep a love that we have struggled to find for so long. This world can be a lonely place when there is no one to share it with, and this book shows us that i think."
5,Wonderful Read,"Christopher David delivered a great debut novel; despite some of the editing issues it was a great read. The characters were well written and many of their individual views were expressed just as the main character. I took away many realistic messages that can be applied to my life especially related to love and the importance of friendship.I am a reader of all types of novels but this book really hit home for me. I have yet to read a novel until this one that talked about the importance of self love in this crazy world today. People are so consumed with loving and pleasing another person and forget about themselves. Its unfortunate the main character Jared wasn't able to cope with the pain of losing love again and realize life does go on no matter how painful. You can't love anyone else unless your learn to be comfortable, content, and love yourself."
2,"Over the Top, Indeed!","While I applaud Mr. David in his effort, it's clear he is a developing writer. This story could have benefited a great deal more from more effective editing; some of the oversights are unforgivable.The characters were colorful and interesting, but there was not a clear sense of time or place as the story unfolded, which was confusing and frustrating.The sense of internal conflict that Jared was experiencing that led to the murder-suicide seemed extraneous and a bit far-fetched, giving the story a loopy, unbalanced quality.I'll look forward to his next work to see his progress.Michael Sainte-Andress"
4,Good Read,"It had great elements to it, The story line and plot twist; especially the ending made me get up outta my seat, it sent me somewhere that no writer hasn't honestly sent me before."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Some of the challenges of managing global teams are obvious. For example, team members will probably speak different languages and come from different cultures. So how do you function in the Tower of Babel? Authors Michael J. Marquardt and Lisa Horvath recommend designating a common language, usually English for American companies. On the other hand, some of the challenges global team managers confront are not so obvious. For instance, what reward system do you use when everyone values different things? Can you just give everyone a pat on the back and a bonus, or must you individualize feedback mechanisms? What etiquette do you follow if everyone has a different sense of what is polite? If these issues haven't occurred to you already, you need this book. If they have, well, We still suggests this rundown on the very basics. As you may have guessed, all the issues you have already confronted with international employees get magnified with global teams."
4,Interesting views,"This is mostly about common sense, but it does provide some clever insight into today's multinationals and it's worth for anyone interested in how our different cultures can work together in one organization, and perform at their best. The authors start from an interesting premise, that is ""you can never completely understand a culture that is not yours / or that you haven't been living in""."

5,totally underrated,I can't believe there was only one review of Life Mirrors. This project produced in the US by London-based Alex Attias & Paul Martin is a great compilation of soulful beats and hip-hop featuring various artists(very influenced by African roots/ African American music) yet all stringed together in a very unique and smooth drum&bass/NuJazz style! Lyrically it is also mostly socially/politically conscious! WAY ahead of it's time... Definitely recommended !
5,Love this comic,I just started reading this comic on a regular basis last year. It's now one of my very favorite ones each day. Don't know why I waited.
4,Fake poo fan here and proud of it!,It is kind of difficult to write a review for a fake turd. You basically know what you are getting. The kid in me loves to strategically place this were guessed can spot it. With 3 cats it isn't hard to imagine that a real poo would randomly show up in the most undersireable places. Fun toy for the kid in you.
2,Poop,Didn't look at all realistic. Joke didn't work. Plastic was too shiny and not flexible. I wasn't able to put on the toilet seat as suggested in the photo. It was too stiff and fake looking. Poor joke.
5,Looks pretty realistic,"I got this to play a trick on fellow adults. When it came, I noticed it looked quite real in design and color. The only problem was that it was slightly curved, so it had to be on a curved surface, like a toilet seat, to be most effective. I had a good time with my prank."
2,Doesn't look real enough to fool anyone,This is very plastic looking.Wouldn't fool anyone unless they were under the influence or had an IQ less than 50.
2,"This is Crap, Not Poop","Come on people! Don't you know the difference between poop and crap?? The turd length/turd width ratio (also known as the s... ratio) is consistent with that of crap, not poop. Crap has a shiny finish, poop is dull in appearance. Before we can ever hope to have an intelligent conversation about the Party Pooper Fake Poop, we must first get the nomenclature right!What really makes this a piece of crap is the convex shape. The curve kills the prank. When you place it on something that is not a toilet seat, it looks like the turd is trying to crawl away like a worm. You can see daylight underneath it! I've never seen poop like that. I'm telling you, this is not poop! It's crap!The prank worked on the kids, but the wife knew it was fake right away. Let's see what kind of trouble I can get into with this thing at work...."
1,Who Needs It?,"Ray Price is, was, and probably always be a great singer, but this is not the album to buy if you're looking for an overview of his biggest hits. His original hits were made for Columbia starting in the '50s, and you need to hear the originals to get the full impact of this great man's work. These ""warmed-over"" versions just don't have the edge and energy of the originals, which in addition to Ray's great vocals also feature groundbreaking instrumental work from some of the greatest country musicians of all time. Look for albums on Columbia/Sony to hear what a great artist Ray REALLY is. I would suggest ""The Essential Ray Price"" as a great place to start."
2,"No pictures, also very basic stuff","This cookbook is alright, but not work the $14 i paid for. There are no pictures and the recipes are way easy, stuff that I already kind of knew"
5,Finally,It has easy to follow steps to make all 3 meals a day and snacks too. Thanks for the assist.I'd reccomend this to anyone who cant cook. :-)
4,Great for a beginner,Given as a gift and they love all the information as well as the recipes. TThe basic tips and explanations are great.
4,Great cook book! Buy it!,It was a great cook book! I love the baked chicken provolone. Only problem is that it doesn't have any steak recipes. But all the other ones are great! Buy it. It is worth it.
5,Must have,"This is a great book for adults who don't know how to bake a potato, not only does it give you so many delicious recipes with easy to find ingredients but it gives you lots of tips and must-haves if your kitchen is empty. yesterday I made ""twice-baked potato casserole"", "" curried vegetable soup"", and ""hummus pocket sandwiches"", today i made ""garlicky pasta with shrimp"", ""baked lemon chicken"" and for breakfast ""apple oatmeal... from scratch"" :D"
4,An all Stooge/detective/Kenneth MacDonald tape.,"STUDIO STOOPS, CRIME ON THEIR HANDS, and SHIVERING SHERLOCKS. This tape would be a LOT better without CRIME ON THEIR HANDS.STUDIO STOOPS is an excellent Three Stooges short. The scenes where Shemp is hanging out the window are great. Vernon Dent is very funny as a detective. A very funny short.CRIME ON THEIR HANDS is a pretty bad short. I don't like the scenes where Kenneth MacDonald is trying to cut Shemp open with a knife. If this short was replaced with DOPEY DICKS, SPOOKS, or WHO DONE IT?, this tape would be five stars.SHIVERING SHERLOCKS is a very funny short, although little is new here. After the lie detector scene, the short goes into plot which basically combines BUSY BUDDIES, DUTIFUL BUT DUMB, and IDLE ROOMERS. Those are all great shorts, but I prefer those instead. This is still a pretty good short, though.The first and last short were great, but I do not like CRIME ON THEIR HANDS."
5,Love this smell!,Loved it enough to look for it online when I could no longer find it in the local stores. . . .
3,Fun gets no simpler,"Add explicit titles and sometimes themes to MIDI Casio demos and you've got a superficial taste of DK. To dismiss the album as such ignores the joys of their inanity. For as trivial as the tracks are, they are reasonably well-constructed. I must still complain, however, of its slight length. This is a fine novelty, but I can think of no reason to choose it over established names in electronica. Funk off is amusing, though. tee hee!"
4,Great style,"This 1980's attempt to recreate the world of film noir might be a little thin on story or substance, but worth its weight in style. Outstanding sets and atmosphere, along with well paced direction and smooth transition keep the film from getting too trite. It's no 'Murder My Sweet' or 'Double Indemnity' but well worth seeing anyway."
5,Great Little Film!,"Possibly one of the best works to come out of Zoetrope Studios, Hammett is worth the price just for the set design work alone. Beautifully done!"
2,Pansy Leading Man,"Casting the lead with a masculine personality would go a long way in improving this movie. The plot was interesting but the acting was so poorly done that the viewer was on his own to find it. I would watch it again, but only if the tv remote was on the other side of the room and both my legs were in casts."
2,A Missed Op,"Not a true biopic and not a real adaptation, just a good-looking drag. The picture's like Frederick Forest's take on the lead character. It looks remarkably authentic, but doesn't hold the interest for long. (Do scenes of writers at work ever really succeed on screen?) While the picture opens with Chandler's lauding Hammett's groundbreaking work, all we see here are cliches in action. We never get a sense of what he was rendering at the time that was different than what others were doing or noticeably realistic. We end up with scenes we've seen a hundred times before and some that explicitly foreshadow better bits in the Falcon. Dean Tavoularis' art direction looks terrific though, and there's some good John Barry scoring."
1,The lid is warped ... over $100 down the drain!,"My husband looked at this, tested both pots and then realized the pressure lid is warped.So it is useless.I have written two emails to this seller with no response.I am beginning to this these guys are ripoff artists.The terms to return the pot are ridiculous and include sending a check for return shipping of the unit if they decide it's not defective.Bad out fit.Amazon should have nothing to do with them."
2,Takes longer to cook,"I really liked the quality of the product, very heavy stainless steel, excellent construction work. But it took much longer to cook as was expected, didn't worked like a pressure cooker. Many nice features but its not for me. I wanted something which will cut the cooking time, but it didn't."
3,Murder is a Family Affair,"The Henshaw family vacation at Yellowstone National Park turns tragic when George Ericksen -- whose family has been befriended by the Henshaws -- is found murdered at the foot of Old Faithful. When amateur sleuth Susan Henshaw is asked to solve the murder, a web of twisted emotions and buried secrets quickly unfolds, and Susan finds that everyone had a reason to kill George."
2,Cheaply made,"The game was pricey considering the very thin wood and small pegs. I was very disappointed with the quality,, but could not return it as it was a gift."
2,Plastic Pegs,"I purchased this set of Chinese Checkers for my octogenerian mom, who always loved this game. I was disappointed in the quality of the pegs. They are plastic and shallow and tend to slip out of their holes during play."
2,Didn't like the plastic pieces,"I agree with another review I saw about the quality of the pieces. They are cheap plastic pieces that often fall out of the holes when you barely graze you hand or sleeve over the board while trying to move a piece. This happened frequently when my kids played. I really like the wood board, and that is why I bought this game. But if I would have actually seen this in a store and touched it with my hands, then I would not have purchased it. The pieces just fall over because they are not heavy enough to stay in place."
1,"wood board, bad pegs",We wanted a peg version so the kids could play easily. The pegs are so light and hollow that they move around worse than marbles. Don't buy it. Get something better.
1,"Plastic pieces fall out of holes, not ""solid wood""",We intended to purchase a solid wood game with solid wood pieces and instead ended up with a wood board and plastic pieces. The pieces do not fit well in the holes and are easily knocked out of the holes when moving other pieces. Spend just a little more to get a game that is less frustrating to play.
3,solid wood is not true,"Chinese checkers is a great game for teaching strategic thinking. I ordered this one for our family thinking that solid wood would be a pleasant tactile experience. I don't really like plastic. Imagine my disappointment when I find, yes, a solid wood playing board, but a jumble of cheap little plastic checkers. Brightly colored, yes. Wood, no. Ick. I had a version that used marbles when I was a kid and I may try to find some marbles to use with this board. As for durability, the board will last forever, but the pieces didn't come with a bag (bring your own Ziploc) and the box is very cheap and will fall apart after a few uses, making it necessary to figure out a way to keep the pieces with the board. I thought we were getting a good value when I read the description, but I recommend looking a little further for a higher quality product."
1,Broke in half after one drop,"One of my kids dropped it one time and the thing broke in half. We were disappointed. The board is made up of multiple pieces of wood glued together, and I guess the glue was weak in one spot."
2,Lost my Marbles,"It's too bad that we can't find a Chinese Checkers game with Marbles anymore. The moves are faster, and they don't have to be as exact. During a speed-round, the pegs are much too slow. THX!"
4,A Classic!,"Chinese checkers, possibly as well liked as normal checkers, is a fun game that requires a good strategy. The goal of the game is to move your marbles into your opponent's triangle. You can move your marbles one space at a time, unless your marbles are placed so that you can jump them. The marbles are pretty, and the board is just as lovely and mesmerizing. My only caution is to keep track of the marbles, because they are easy to lose!I would definately recommend this game. Even slightly younger children might learn to enjoy this game, as long as you keep the marbles away from their mouth!"
3,Chinese Checkers,"This product arrived with 11 other sets in a box. I contacted the company and sent the 11 back I didn't pay for. I noticed that the board was smaller than I thought, and instead of using marbles, it uses pegs. I guess I didn't read the info close enough. It did arrive in good shape and in a timely fashion."
3,Great read,Another excellent story be Lee driver. Love this series and can't wait to read the rest of the series to see how the love story evolves
5,chase dagger rocks,"you need to red this series - oh, by the way - this book is #3 in the series.....as you can see above, the TITLE has only the # sign - they seemed to have forgotten the #3"
1,What a Lousy Deck,"The artwork in this deck is simplistic and childish, which isn't always a bad thing, and certainly makes for an unusual-looking deck. The minor arcana are not illustrated, which some people prefer, and some detest. However, I objected to the fact that it is titled ""The 'Witches' Tarot."" As a Witch, I can say that a great deal of the symbolism is just plain wrong. The Tarot was originally derived from medieval Christian mysticism, which is why decks geared toward modern pagans substitute certain traditional elements with more appropriate themes. As an example, 'The Devil' would not appear in many 'real' Witches decks. Most of us do not believe in the devil, and a substitution of a pagan god such as Osiris or the Celtic Antlered God would be prefered. Poorly done and misleadingly titled."
1,The ugliest deck I've ever seen.,"This deck has the worst art I have ever seen in a tarot deck.The minor arcana is repretitive - each of the numbered cards simply has the appropriate number of suit items, copied by computer, which is as boring and uninspiring as possible.The major arcana are the simplest I've seen, with tasteless art - the people are pictured unproportionaly, and are too similar to one another (e.g. the hair).Some people criticize the art of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck as being plain, but this deck is just ugly, uninspiring, and I'm not surprised I havent seen or heard of anybody using this deck to read for himself or anybody else."
1,"The Doors??? no, no, no!","I like not all but most of Geoege Winstons music. So I tried this CD. I just can't get past the overall music.I never liked the doors music at all! Some folks love the doors nothing more than ""rambling on to me"" and as good as GW pulls this off ""100% better than the original"" I still do not like the overall music. I would give 5 stars for GW's interpretation and ""0"" for the overall Doors music."
2,Eine Kleine Elevator Music,"What would you get, I wonder, if you took the Doors- one of the greatest of all rock and roll bands- and toook away Morrison's rich baritone, the dark lyrics, Kreiger's sitar-like droning guitar lines, and arranged it all for a skating rink? This is what you'd get.Because as great as the Doors music was, the songs were just not terribly complex melodically. ""Light My Fire"" is basically a two-chord song with a couple of very short themes that repeat, and unless you're Mozart there's just not a lot to improvise on. And Winston, for all his charm, is not Mozart.What Winston has produced is 45 minutes of noodling of the sort done by thousands of amateur pianists. There's nothing discordant or annoying about it, but at the same time there's nothing terribly interesting, either. It's just background music of the sort that made the phrase ""New Age Music"" the butt of a thousand musicians' jokes."
1,The revolution is over.,"I wanted to like this cd I really did. I like George Winston and own December, Autumn and others. I like the Doors and own their music as well. I did I really did want to like this. Instead I feel as though my music has been reduced to cocktail lounge stuff. You can tell by how its being played, ole George is thinking he's really working it but it just doesn't work. At least not for me. I cringed, I skipped songs, I went back and listened. Oh I know the intent was good but the end does not justify the means. In a word ... YUCK!"
1,Stick with Doors' originals,"George Winston is talented, and his December CD is really beautiful. But I feel he is worlds away from Ray Manzarek, the Doors' keyboardist, in temperament and style. The leap is just too great. I kept thinking of the Doors' originals while listening to ""Night Divides the Day,"" and that is never a good sign.A rock critic once wrote that all cover albums ..., and this is no exception, sad to say."
1,great disapointment,Not much to say about this one. So poor I wouldn't even resell it to someone else. Possibly good frisbee material.
1,ENHANCED - It has been destroyed!!,"I love George Winston and I love the Doors, so this album should be heaven to me - but alas I have wasted my money. I may be a bit of a techno geek, but you see I don't own a CD player anymore. All of my music gets loaded onto a computer and is served up to whatever room in the house that I want it listen to it. This CD has been ""protected"" so that computers cannot read it. All you get is the screen saver. I didn't buy a screen saver, I bought music and I am being denied access to it."
3,The Doors of Perception.,"These are skilled and insightful interpretations from George (and the recording is first class) but ultimately it's only novelty value for me - and I'm both a Winston and Doors fan. Ray Manzarek was gracious in his accolades featured on the CD cover, but maybe there was also an element of flattery for Ray. Some of the classic songs interpreted by Winston end up sounding too reductionist - even though George works hard to straddle both vocal and instrumental lines with panache. I found myself filling in Morrison's vocals and other instruments in my mind, and perhaps that evocation is a measure of Winston's skill - but I ended up feeling just a little deprived of the full spectrum. Still, its worth a play every now and then - and who knows, I may even end up playing it more than Radiohead's Greatest Hits by The Hawaiian Ukelele Collective."
1,Big Disappointment - No Bright Spots Here,"As a dedicated fan of George Winston and The Doors, I eagerly awaited my first listen to this CD. I was bitterly disappointed however. Seems like a good idea, but it just doesn't work. Some of the songs that should sound bright and uplifting get turned into dirges. The spirit of The Doors is missing. What makes so much of the Doors music gratifying is Jim Morrison's voice or the intricate solos by Robby or Ray, neither, of course, are here. The engineering bothered me a lot too and was distracting -- the piano just sounds odd. I hear distortion, key thunks, the higher notes get lost in noise and turn into clinks. One listen to this CD was more than enough for me."
3,"John McCormack, Irish Tenor","When I was growing up and the Beatles just coming to prominence, my late father repeatedly tried to get me interested in my cultural heritage and specifically, the Irish tenor, John McCormack. This hour-long tribute to McCormack's life and accomplishments provides information about his quick rise to fame and about the body of his work. I was also impressed to hear of his many charitable works. Very enjoyable."
3,Atlantis Underwater Camera,"I was not real impressed with this product. The camera has to be maneuvered to get a good picture. You cannot see anything when it starts to get dark. I thought I would get a clear image of fish, instead we find ourselves staring at the screen saying ""I think I might have seen one"". I have seen other underwater cameras that give a much clearer picture."
2,"""Not expensive"" yes, But...","I found that the infrared system was a joke at best. They say 15 feet in complete darkness, I think maybe 15 inches!...I have a friend who bought a different brand and he was real happy so I know there are better systems available. I wish I would have spent a little more $$$ for the good stuff."
4,Love it!,"I absolutely love this espresso pot. I bought the 2 cup (3 oz) version and it really makes less than 2 oz - which is fine with me, but would have been nice to know when I was considering purchasing it. I have the Bialetti aluminium espresso pot that makes a lot more and I am happy with it. I wanted to get one that was stainless steel and smaller. I bought the Bialetti brand stainless steel that was made in India and it was a piece of junk. It was really poorly made. I returned that one and bought the Vev Vigano which was made in Italy and the quality of the craftsmanship is top notch."
3,rust,it came with some rust inside the base and i already complained and have not heard back from any one
2,Save your money,"I've spent a long time looking for a copy of this movie at an affordable price, and was surprised when I found it in a double pack. The package descibes it as digitally remasterd, it's not. And the worst part is the movie cuts off during the final fight scene, maybe 90 seconds left in the movie and it jumps back to the menu screen."
4,Yangtze thru the eyes of millions,"A funny account of one man's cruise down the Yangtze with a group of American millionaires... Insightful, biting humor. An accurate description of tour-isms."
2,hmmm...,"I liked the idea of this product, but it broke after a few months. I can't quite recommend it to everyone because it's so cheaply made.I still like the idea though..."
2,Unarmed Combatives 2,"Hello! This is Hock. This old video was part of a old training set. Without the other fundamentals, it is not worth much at all. Instead? I would search on my name, W. Hock Hochheim on the internet and see all the new, improved material, in training order and on DVD! That is where I would spend my money. This whole subject has been reshot, redone and is so much better on DVD and cheaper too! Given the new DVD, I wouldn't waste my time with this old video at all."
5,Apurimac III Is the Best,"I heard this CD while in a Seattle's Best getting espresso. Had to have it so I ordered it as soon as I was back at my desk. It is a CD that I can play over and over and never tire of hearing. I have loaned it to friends, and each time they had to have it. I highly recommend it."
1,smells good,"This product has a really nice sent, but does not create a good lather to shave with. A bay rum aftershave would be a better buy, and get a glycerin based shaving soap, it's really the only way to go."
5,"Child's ""Eye"" View","I work in an optometric office, and we purchased two copies for our waiting area. This book gives not only accurate descriptions of vision issues that our young patients may have, but also describes in quite un-scary language, with great illustrations, what a detailed eye exam will involve, including receiving the drops to dilate their eyes. It sends the message that, although the equipment used may be quite intimidating to the young patients, the end result, improved eyesight, is indeed a blessing."
3,"Not a fan, but my daughter is","We bought this book for our daughter when she needed to get glasses at 15 months. The premise is good, but the execution annoys me. The illustrations are poor and make some of the characters look downright scary. The author tries to get cute and use ""I's"" instead of ""eyes"", but does so inconsistently which just makes it seem wrong instead of cute. But who am I to judge, my daughter loves it."
2,A bit out there,"If you are looking for an easy read, you have found it here! This is probably because we are unfortunately subjected to the same ""wedding planning list"" again and again throughout the book. The main character is whiny and thoroughly unlikable. Even her angst seems contrived and cliche as she plods through the story. I found myself wanting it to end way before it did."
2,Not worth your time,"I found this book to be surprisingly dull and predictable. I may have smiled once while reading it. I'd call it mildly amusing at best, certainly not funny. This is the first time I've considered not finishing a book once I started it. I found the use of so many footnotes throughout to be distracting. Overall- disappointing!"
1,"Derivative, shallow, dull","If you just adore sentimental relationship/wedding stories (that pretend to be biting satire but are really just mildly snarky puff pieces), this book might be a fun time-waster for a few hours (you can skim most of it since it's plenty repetitive). On the other hand, if you are alienated by the Wedding Industrial Complex that insists that your invitations must match your reception tablecloths, OR by the notion that weddings are the pinnacle of women's lives, skip it. While the protagonist is supposedly ever-so-modern (whoa, she has a job! she briefly considers not changing her name! she has sex with her boyfriend BEFORE marriage!), the tale is the usual trite oh-the-wedding-planning-was-so-stressful-but-it-was-all-WORTH-it goo. Sorry, but I'm tired of the ""desperate but kooky single women"" genre."
1,Couldn't finish it.,I had to stop reading this book because as a bride-to-be I found it extremely negative and depressing. I also thought it read like a bad comedy show. I gave it away and am dissapointed I wasted [$$] on it.
1,Shallow,"Sorry girls, I just couldn't get past how shallow this chick is. I guess, six-months post-wedding myself, I realize that the wedding was a beautiful event but I'm glad it's over so we could get to the good stuff."
4,good diversion,"This was a good diversionary book, such as for reading on a plane. It was amusing, sometimes making me chuckle to myself, and did not require a great deal of concentration. I just hope no brides are reading it looking for pointers on how to plan a wedding!I think this book appealed to me because I recently helped my daughter plan her wedding. Reading ""Diary of a Mad Bride"", I found myself feeling glad that she was more organized and decisive than Amy. No wonder Amy was nervous...it's a wonder her wedding ever came together!"
2,Don't read it if you're planning a wedding.,"This book was okay--very Bridget Jones-ish, some truths (I'm planning my own wedding and I've been sleepless quite a bit), and lots of lazy writing. Count the number of times someone is ""hip checked""--it seems to happen in every chapter. I don't believe the ""I couldn't find a wedding dress"" for a second; there are just too many of them out there. If you're at all nervous about planning your wedding, don't read it. The shrill tone and hysterics on every page will just needlessly raise your already heightened anxiety."
2,Take Off of Bridget Jones's Diary,"From the quirky family to the cooking disaster to her career in publishing with troublesome co-workers and beyond, it's clear that this book is a take off of BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY. If you're interested in a really funny book stick with the original.I gave this two stars instead of one because Laura Wolf showed that she has the potential to be a talented writer."
4,Funny,"What a quick, funny story! Told in diary form, we get to follow Amy - who wants nothing more than to NOT get married - especially after having to deal with her friend Mandy whose wedding is fast approaching and has turned into a complete bridezilla. Shortly before Mandy's big day, Amy's boyfriend Stephen proposes to her (in line for refreshments at the movie theater) and POOF!!! Amy is now a bride-to-be!We're introduced to Amy's family, Stephen's family, and a few of Amy's friends and co-workers and watch everything start to unravel as she tries to slap together a wedding on a shoestring budget. The book was funny - perfect for the summer. I found it incredibly relatable as I am also planning a wedding, which is why I picked up the book.If you're getting married, or you're a bridesmaid in a wedding, definitely grab this book - you will laugh yourself silly!"
2,Cute -- but it could have been better,"Diary of a Mad Bride is the journal of Amy Thomas who, after complaining about how annoying her bride-to-be friend is, gets engaged herself. She decides to be organized; she makes a list of everything she has to do to make her wedding come off; and her journal recounts everything that actually happens.It's an amusing read, and one that should draw chuckles of recognition from just about everybody, but at almost 300 pages it starts to feel like too much of the same thing. There's a nod to family relations, a few details about work, but nothing to give the book a little more depth or texture or even a little variety."
5,Lovely Story,"I loved this book! The story is sweet, simple, and does not demand so much concentration. It is the sort of book you would want to read before going to bed. I enjoyed the writer's sense of humor and always had a big smile while reading the book. If you are planning your wedding, the story will not help you much with your wedding preparations, but you might find a few helpful tips. I am a bride-to-be and reading the book comforted me about how my wedding would turn out. Even if you are not a bride-to-be nor a person who enjoys reading, you will still enjoy reading this book :)"
4,Very funny!!!,"This book was absolutely hilarious!! I picked it up seeking a funny, light, enjoyable read after some of the heavier themed books I've finished, and I sure found it!This book zips right along, formatted as diary entries of Amy Thomas, whose friends it seems are all getting married, and going crazy. Amy vows never to become a crazy, delusional bride-to-be. But when Stephen her boyfriend proposes to her, things quickly start spinning out of control. Before she knows what's happening, she's second guessing her antique engagement ring, the way Stephen proposed, her wedding dress, and fighting in public about her bridal flowers!As soon I finished this book I IMMEDIATELY picked up the next one, Diary of a Mad Mother-To-Be, and am half-way through already. I highly recommend this book, it's fast-paced and VERY funny! A great book for future brides, married women, or anyone even remotely interested in weddings!"
4,Enjoyable and quick read,"I enjoyed this book and read it in two days. It had a lot of funny parts to it and the journal entry format made it a fun read. The ending wasn't as great as I expected, it seemed the whole book built up to the big day and then it got rushed, but none the less it was still worth reading."
2,"So-so book, horrible wedding.","I am not a Bride, a bridesmaid, and I am not engaged, so maybe I could not enjoy this book properly. I didn't think this book was very realistic and I was dissapointed with some of the events that unfolded. I mean who gives their son $5000 to plan a wedding then a list of 200 guests they expect to be invited? Cough up some more dough or tear up the list!! And, I hated Amy's wedding. I wanted to cry for her. I hated her dress, I hated her reception, her buffet..and most of all her parents. I would have eloped. To be fair, I should read this again when I am engaged and I might change my mind. For now I give it a 2."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!,"The other reviewers have pretty much covered my feelings about this book. It's light, its funny, and its true to life. The bride starts out sensible and sane - not wanting to be like any of her friends who have gotten married. She thinks all she needs to keep her perspective is a good list and maybe one bridal book to refer to.She makes the list, buys the bridal book, then adds to the list. She has to change the wedding date so it doesn't interfere with basketball season (or any other sport) and slowly loses her sense of humor, her friends and even her groom (temporarily).Her wedding dress is a story in itself and the final madness seems to hinge on the search for wedding shoes!I enjoyed the book immensely - could there maybe be a sequel??"
5,an excellent gag gift for any bride-to-be,"The author did a remarkable job in desribing the many crazy thoughts and actions of a bride-to-be. As someone who was married about a year ago, this book not only provided me many reasons to laugh, but also chances to remember the endless hilarious moments I went through during wedding planning!"
3,not bad,"The book was not terrible, but was a little boring. Having gone through planning a wedding, I could relate to the pressures, but nothing in this novel had me laughing out loud. I think it was a good explanation of the wedding stresses to expect, but could have been a bit funnier. After all, planning a wedding can get ridiculous at times, and I don't think the author capitolized on that."
5,All Brides are alike,"I recieved this book from my husband's grandmother just before our wedding. I wish I had read it PRIOR to our wedding so then I would know that what I was experienceing was ""just a typical bride"". I read this after our wedding and laughed out loud with tears in my eyes...many times proclaiming, ""THAT""S ME!"". Laura Wolf nailed the emotions of a bride-to-be on the button. I always thought I too would be a logical bride yet once the planning began, my vision grew & my mind was lost :0). If you know anyone getting married BUY THIS for them, if you're getting married, READ THIS! It will put your mind at ease, give you the much needed laughter and give you a break from the 24/7 planning process! Looking forward to the Diary of a Mad-Mom-to-be & learn what my life is going to experience next."
4,Great for Brides,"This book is great for brides. It made me realize that no matter what, brides are a little crazy and it helped me see the humor in planning a wedding."
5,Laugh out loud hilarious!,"This is the funniest book I have ever read. If you attend a lot of weddings, and have close friends getting married, you will love this book."
4,If you need a good laugh (and you do)...,"I bought this book about a month before my wedding, not realizing how desperately I needed a good laugh. But, boy, this book didn't disappoint! I laughed so hard I cried & not just because some points do hit home; it was comforting to see that I hadn't totally lost my marbles. Despite how calm & collected you may be--and believe me, you always think you're doing better than you are--you still need this book. If for no other reason than to have a much-needed chuckle & prove to yourself that you aren't as hung up on Ginger Blossoms than some brides."
2,"Do yourself a favor and try ""Otherwise Engaged""....","this book is fluffy and OK, but it seems to mimic an earlier (and in my opinion, much better) novel that Knopf published in 1999...""Otherwise Engaged,"" by Suzanne Finnamore. while Mad Bride goes for the broad laughs, Otherwise delves much deeper and is way funnier. The critics agree, apparently...."
3,Bristle Are very Long,"Not much to say about this product. Its a brush made out of a wire with nylon bristles. Extremely cheaply made. The hard part to judge is the length of the bristles. In this case they match the width of a beer bottle, as a matter of fact the whole brush is the size of a long neck bottle."
5,Tall and sturdy,"This is great brush. I have a 12"" glass water bottle with a narrow opening and was cleaning it with baking soda and vinegar because I couldn't find anything to get all the way to the bottom. This brush is long enough that I don't have to reach my fingers in the bottle to try to get the scrubby head all the way to the end. The bristles are sturdy and I am confident in its cleaning. I even used it on my stubborn vacuum cleaner!"
1,Pure Fiction,Pure Fiction.....not accurate. If you knew the truth about Russ Brice and the Discovery Channel....it would make you sick. Some people will do ANYTHING for money.I know...I was there. I was part of the 2006 Himex expedition and I am on the DVD.Brett Merrell
3,"Uninteresting, focus on climbers not on climb","I purchased this with high hopes of seeing a dramatic presentation on the effort and details on climbing Everest, with spectacular views of the region and some information too about the Sherpas who make a living guiding good and bad climbers up the mountainside. The views and the Sherpas are here, but the focus is almost completely on the people and their personalities. I got bored in the first episode and it went downhill for me afterwards. Lots of worrying, grandstanding, sorrowing, and so on. Very emotional at times, but again, not much about the climbing or climbing techniques. Not informative but perhaps best described as a passionate human-interest story."
2,This was not inspirational in the slightest,"Did no one else find it incredibly disturbing that, in the first episode alone, a young Sherpa passed away during the show's first few minutes and a very severely ill man was shown labouring for breath and turning white as his brain swelled? It was played as a heroic story of the climbers rescuing a man, but I just found it deeply unsettling. I couldn't take away the inspirational messages of conquering the mountain and all that tripe. I could only sit there and wonder, ""Is climbing a mountain for entertainment really worth it?"" as, on the screen in front of me, a man's eyelids were peeled open to reveal blank and unresponsive eyes, before the camera cut away to dramatic closeups of the climbers. Not to mention that Sherpa. Everyone is concerned over David Sharp's death, but what about the young man who died? Is he less important?This was too disturbing and voyeuristic. I couldn't stomach it."
2,Beyond what limits?,"Only a Discovery reality series could take climbing the highest mountain on earth and make it seem as melodramatic as The Real Housewives of New Jersey. Some of the characters (that's what they are after all) are truly inspiring, but when you get down to it, commercial summit expeditions aren't really very interesting. The dramatic focus of the last few episodes of Season 1 is basically a bunch of guys standing around waiting for a bunch of other guys to climb up a ladder (yes, a ladder like you get from the hardware store). Doesn't sound very exciting, does it?"
1,Don't Buy,"I looked forward to listening to jazz on my deck, porch and garage. Hooked it up to two tvs, stereo,Sirus sat. Never worked, Don't waste your time"
5,Got no complaints,Just hooked it up and it works great. We've got the Reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we won't miss anything! So far so good.
1,The Gift that keeps Costing,"I gave as a gift. When the recipients tried to hook it up, it did not work (yes, they read the directions thoroughly and called the 800#). DynaDirect has such a restrictive return policy that there is no way a buyer could receive the product, hook it up, determine it doesn't work and return it within the 7 day return (from their shipping date) policy. Needless to say, the 7 days has passed to return it to DynaDirect and I can get no help to contact the manufacturer / warehouse / North Pole to get the unit replaced or repaired. I'm out $100 and my gift is a pile of electronic junk in the corner of my friends closet!Don't waste your money on this product!Don't purchase electronic gifts through the internet.and Don't buy anything from DynaDirect if there is any chance you may need to return the inoperable mess the ship to you."
2,Works but only with batteries.,"I had the same problem as other reviewers with these speakers but tried to move them outside as another person suggested. Once I did that, they worked for a while. I found though that if you use batteries and not the AC adaptor, they seem to work just fine. It takes 8 C batteries though so prepare to spend some money on rechargables!Advent (aka RCA) need to shield these speakers from outside interferance for these to get a better review.Once they finally started working, they sound pretty good for a low-end speaker system."
1,Don't buy,This wireless speaker had a usable range of about 5 to 10 feet. Not 300 feet like the description says. I even called tech support and they were no help.
1,did not work for me,I like to think that I am at least fairly competant and can follow simple instructions. I purchased two advent speakers neither of these items would work. I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with tech support (Thompson provides the support for these units) the tech support was very patient and helpful but we still could not get the units to work. I returned both units and subsituded with a set of acoustic research wireless which work flawlessly.
4,Good product for the price.,"This speaker has met my expectations and works well. We use it both outside on battery power, as well as inside in one of the upstairs rooms plugged in with the AC cord. I read some of the other reviews about interference etc., so was a little hesitant when I bought it. But, it was the only reasonably priced wireless indoor/outdoor speaker I could find. I was happy after I bought the product and would recommend this product (though I don't think it's the highest quality speaker for those looking for a high end speaker)."
4,This is not for audiophiles,"These are not for audiophiles, who spend all night waffling on about the depth of a speakers sound, pretending they can hear the difference between speakers that costs $1500 and $1600! However that said, if you want a speaker that within 5 minutes of setting up let's you listen to your favourite cd's on your home system, and not eat up the batteries go ahead and buy these you won't be dissapointed.Expecting these speakers to have the performance of high end speakers costing several hundred or thousands of dollars is absurd. By the way for those moaning about low volume levels and static, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!"
2,Does not travel through walls well,"If you're looking for a wireless speaker system that works well through walls then this is NOT the speaker you want. I bought it expecting it to work from my living room (where the transmitter was) to my deck (25 ft. away). If I moved the unit into the outside window line-of-sight to the transmitter then the speaker clarity was better. However, I was disappointed overall with the performance."
4,Great item,This item is exactly what we were looking for. Its range reaches over 100 feet into our back yard. Those who complain about range probably didn't read the manual throughly. While the frequency response isn't as good as my regular stereo speakers (natch) this is just the ticket for providing music while I'm firing up the grill.
3,"Does the job, but, noise in background","I bought this to go listen on our deck to the digital cable music channels from the television in the house. I can't get the transmitter to show a red light of any kind, no matter what I try. Very noisy interference until I turned off the speakers to the television and only used the Advent speaker. Thats ok if I only want music in one place. I rate this fair because of this."
1,no good!,very poor sound quality. It barely works. lots of static. I had to install hard wired outdoor speakers. I have bought items from Amazon before and this one is not a keeper.
1,"Second Chance, this time works","Update 2006.08.03This time it worked like a charm as soon as I plugged it in. I guess they require a better quality control to avoid exchanges.------------I followed the instructions step by step (as recommended by some reviewers), I installed the transmitter in a RCA out (fixed volume), turned on the home theater, waited until the red light was blinking on the transmitter, adjusted the frequency, turned on the speaker, adjusted the frequency, incresed the volume, all perfect. 2 minutes later, game over. I tried again numerous times, and I even called Advent Customer Support to see if I was missing something. After all the troubleshooting they confirmed that the speaker was dead, possibly due to an internal amplifier problem.I am giving it a second change. Returning the item tomorrow and expecting a replacement. I will update the review when I get it."
3,Advent AW810 900 MHz Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Speaker System,"I ordered two speakers- one worked the other did for about 30 seconds. Amazon was quick to process the return and credit. I wouldn't recommend these if you are looking for high end acoustics, but they do the job if you aren't picky."
1,Do NOT Buy This,It doesn't work! This may seem like a bargain compared to the price for comparable products at any electronics store. It's not! It didn't work. I bought a comparable product at Best Buy for about $100 - worked fine.
1,Piece of junk,"Brought it and tried everything the instructional booklet says but still won't work. And the refund process is overly complicated since I don't even mail this back to Amazon's warehouse, I have to directly give this back to EEK. God knows how the hell will I get my refund back. One of biggest mistake of my online purchase.DO NOT, for your own sake, NO NOT but this!!"
1,Piece of JUNK ! ! !,"Followed all of the directions - still couldn't get it to make a peep. Don't waste your time or your money trying at any price,"
1,Don't buy this junk!,"The speaker didn't work when I got it from Amazon. I decided to call the vendor for help. After waiting for about 30 minutes, I finally got a technical woman to answer my call. She confirmed the speaker is defective because there is no sound even if the lights of both transmitter and speaker are on.. I returned it to Amazon.BTW, I bought Accurian AWS-1475 wireless speacker at RadioShack for about $99. It's more expensive but it's crystal clear and extremely easy to be setup ( less than five minutes and you don't need to tune it! ). Too bad, Amazon doesn't carry it."
3,Receiver Drifts,"Sounds great! The receiver drifts off frequency occasionally. This results in a loud hissing which wakes me up. Not recommended for the bedroom. Rather than 900 Mhz., what about 2.4 Ghz?"
1,did not work,"I ordered this quite a while ago, it does not work, never has worked. I haven't been able to return it and probably will just have to throw it out. Useless and a waste of money."
1,Stay far away! Zero stars,"Wish I read the reviews here more completely. This was a complete piece of trash. Like with others, the speaker would not play for more than 30 seconds at a time no matter what I did. After a while I could feel that the speaker was over heating so I left it unplugged. Sure enough it came back and played for another 30 seconds and then quit. It's going back to Amazon immediately!"
2,"Unfortunately, too good to be true","I had read the negative reviews that complained of this product ceasing to work shortly after receiving it, but figured I would roll the dice because the price was so good and I knew I could return it if it didn't work. Well folks, it didn't. It played for about 30 seconds and then quit. If I turned it off and then turned it back on, it would play for about five seconds before quitting. If I left it off for a long time, it would return to playing for 30 seconds before quitting. Really weird. I can't imagine what would make it do this. Regardless, I've returned it to Amazon, who also paid for the shipping.I gave it two stars because it sounded fine while it worked. If you get lucky and get one that works, you will probably like this product. But if I were Amazon, I'd drop it to avoid all of the additional shipping charges for returns."
2,"good sound, limited range.","The sound from the unit is descent given the size and construction. The wireless system, however is pretty bad. In an urban area you might be able to get 20', but even then you'll get periodic interference. In a more rural setting it becomes moderately usable, with more like 40' and fewer blasts of junk."
1,Junk,"I hooked the speaker up as soon as I got it out of the box. Turned it on, thought wow that's rather impressive. Let me change it to one of the music channels. Then it stopped once I changed the channel. Called the customer service # on the transmitter, and sat on the phone for 15 to 20 minutes with an incompetent person who really didn't know anything about the product. On that note, I will be returning it to amazon."
3,"Good product, but limited range and touchy.....","Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. The speakers perform well and provide better sound than I expected.I'm only disappointed by two things. First, the range seems to be much less than advertised, especially in my house that has concrete and plaster walls. Second, the tuning of the speakers is very touchy. It sometimes takes a few iterations to get everything working well."
4,Four Stars for Now!,"Just purchased the Advent Speaker. Sounds Great on initial test. For the long haul, only time will tell. Have yet to move it 300ft away as advertised. Did not have huge expectations of massive distance performance going in, so I won't be to dissapointed if I can't plant this in my neighbors yard to scare him."
1,Wireless is not there yet!,"If you are looking for quality, and reliability, pay much more or wait 10 years. Use wired speakers if you want any sort of sound quality. If you are just looking for noise and are will to tune in your speaker occasional this product might be rated a 2 star. But.. hide the wire and get a good speaker"
2,Advent AW810 wireless speaker,"I can't recommend this product. I've fiddled with tuning it hours after hours and keep it only 60 yds from my indoor receiver. Yes the signal is traveling through a glass baCK DOOR AND WALLS OF THE HOUSE - BUT GIVE ME A BREAK. The consistent,annoying, crackling interference that transmits lessen the overall experience. - Technology isn't quite there yet."
1,2yr user,I buoght this speaker for my husband to use on the deck with our sony receiver and 5 disc player.we have bose speakers in the house.The sound quality is fair and I am always fiddling with the dial to get decent sound.Now after a few years use and less than 30 hours of use the speaker doesnt work anymore.Frankly I am gravely disappointed.I would not buy one again.
3,colour,"Looks like a winner for distance and extra features,but why only cream for outside,are the advent from another planet.Also no technical data available."
1,speaker,"this product did not work and was missing jacks needed to operate that you said were included. Very dissappointed. Plus, you won't let me return it now."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!,"I just received the unit today and after spending 1 hour on the phone with the manufacturers service department, I have to send it back because it is defective. This is a piece of junk and should not be sold!"
1,What the heck?,"This is a joke of a DVD. The package says it shows you advanced strategy on the game. Yet, the author states that each spin is independent of the last;Therefore, no stategy could be accurate in a totally random game. In my opinion, this guy has no business touting a ""how to play"" DVD. Most of this video is other people playing the game with obviously some kind of stategy, since they are hitting but we are not entitled to see that."
4,New Version Of A Classic Car,"I've been a big fan of the T.V. Batmobile since I was a kid. I've collected several versions over the decades including the Corgi, and the Husky diecasts, but I was never quite satisfied because, no matter how nice they were, they just weren't quite right.This new Hot Wheels version is really no better or worse than the previous versions. The shape of the car has been compromised somewhat to make it more 'Hot Wheels' style. I do like the red pinstriping down the sides, although it would've been nice if it continued around the front and rear of the car. But hey, this is a toy. If you really want a more accurate replica, you'll have to go for the 1:50 or 1:18 scale Hot Wheels diecast, which has been scanned from the original #1 car used in the '66 television show."
1,OVER PRICED,"To the people who gave this rewinder a good review: Did you actually pay $ 140.00 for this thing. A tape rewinder is a $30.00 item, at most. And that includes profit. There is NOTHING you can put inside a simple rewinder(I've taken them apart. It's a ""rubber band drive""), to make it cost that much. You can buy a DVD / tape PLAYER, for that price and those are loaded with electronics. Let's not even talk about the one for $ 170.00"
4,A Good Rewinder,"This unit is very smooth & efficient in operation. Vey quiet, too. The only catch is that one has to press down the lid just right way or it won't kick on. Once you get the knack for that, it works great."
3,No damaged tapes,"I've used this rewinder about 10 times. It is somewhat loud during use, and the noise when it finishes is a bit alarming, but the tapes have been fine. I only use my vcr to record/watch tv shows, so the tapes I'm using have all been used more that 8 times. Great deal, product works as described."
3,No Light,AMBICO VHS Rewinder. Light indicating winder is in use burned out after one tape was rewound. Works well except for that malfunction. Not very good qualify controlI believe.
4,Good Deal,It works fine for what it does which is rewind tapes. It is no frills but what we needed and the price is right. I have had no problems with it so far..
3,Video Rewinders,Purchased two for Children's Hospital to rewind 20-50 movies daily. One of the rewinders stopped working after only 3 days. Amazon was great in sending a replacement before I even had time to return the defective one. I just hope these rewinders last for at least 6 months. Seems like these soon-to-be-obsolete items can't hold up with lots of use.
2,tape rewinder - short life,Ordered 2 tape rewinders at the same time. One already not working right. Sent back under warranty. Never heard from them nor have I receieved it back repaired or a new onw. DO NOT BUY...they do not honor warranty.
4,cute for boys room,Cute curtains for boys room. Not as well made as anticipated but my son doesn't mess with them so they will be fine until he's tired of them.
4,"Not all new info, but still a good read ....","I've read several of the M/V books and this one isn't all new info, but it did help me to understand some basic differences in men and women. I wouldn't put it at the top of the list of must-reads, but I think overall, it's worth your time."
4,Must read for male to female relationships,"This book provides a true map of how to navigate the sexes. A great book for male to female discussions, and it gives excellent insight into the behaviors that people exhibit. An easy, intelligent, great book. Read It!"
1,Only 160 words!,I cannot believe it when I bought this CD set and discovered you only get to learn 160 words with his teaching method. Yes I counted them! Actually this is more like a infocommercial to sign up for his classes. A title named Learn in Your Car gives you 1800 words for less money and it actually works. I can't beleive any company would put this type of product out and call it a true learning experience.
1,Can't believe how bad this is!,"This is the most boring, slow-moving, patronizing product imaginable! You'll fall asleep before getting very far. It's mostly marketing and very little substance. If you think learning a language without effort with no drills and nothing to memorize sounds too good to be true, trust your good sense and avoid this product!"
2,Too many annoyances to focus on the Spanish Content,"Before you decide to spend money on this, I just want to give a general warning to potential buyers. The content of the CDs may be good; however, there are a few things that may annoy you to the point where you can't focus on the lessons.I borrowed this from my library to listen to on my way to work. Because the main speaker (Michel Thomas) speaks at a low volume and with an accent, I was forced to turn my stereo up rather loud in order to understand what he was saying in English. This made it difficult to begin with. Then during every pause, Michel Thomas makes a noise with his mouth like he is swallowing. It is very noticable and really starts to get to you. I could only listen about 20 minutes before I had to turn it off for my personal sanity. It reminded me of someone who said ""um"" after every phrase.I am glad I previewed it from my library first, otherwise I would be upset that I spent so much money on something I could not listen to."
2,Frenchman Teaches Spanish,"I invested in this set based on the reviews and recommendations. I have been disappointed and have not gotten past the first CD simply because Michel Thomas sounds like a Frenchman trying to speak Spanish. I'm sure his teaching technique is fine, but his Spanish pronunciation is poor. I've had several years of Spanish in school in the past, and native Spanish speakers have told me that my pronunciation and accent are very good, so I hesitate to listen to 8 hours of Spanish with a French accent. I'd have to say opt for something else if you want to both learn the vocabulary and the proper speaking habits for Spanish."
4,Excellent start to learning spanish!,"I am half way through this set up CD's, and I am very impressed. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is just starting out in the spanish language or looking for a review of the spanish they learned years ago. I took 3 years of spanish in high school about 10 years ago and learned very little. I feel as if I have learned more in the first 4 cd's than I did in my entire 3 years of high school spanish. This CD definetly gives you a great start in the spanish language.Why not 5 stars? Yes the male student is a bit annoying. There is a little too much time spent on pronuciation, and not enough spent on expanding your vocabulary. I also think there should be some work on comprehension. I hope that Michel Thomas does some follow-on lessons to this one, if so I will be the first in line to buy it!"
5,Brilliant. Can't recommend it enough.,"Amazing. My first study of Spanish. Listened to CDs in car for 2 weeks before trip to Cuba last December, and I was easily conversing in broken Spanish with Cubanos; in fact I occasionally helped translate for our group of 25... exceeding some who'd studied in high school, even college. Have listened (passively...) a few more times, and this unique approach to the language has given me such a good foundation that i'm able to pick up more and more with suprising ease. Learning new verbs, and conjugating them... obviously not with perfection, but i'm able to understand, and, especially, be understood. My friend who's marrying a Latina used it to be able to communicate with his mother-in-law on his wedding day. I've never written an online review, but this CD demands it. If you want to quickly and easily start learning, this is the way."
2,Horrible pronunciation,"From what I've listened to so far, this is the most horribly pronounced Spanish program I've ever heard. The Spanish is not spoken by native speakers, and one cannot even make allowances for the poor pronunciation by considering that it is a non-native who is speaking. This is Spanish spoken with a British accent. A British accent is lovely if you're speaking English in England. It doesn't fly well if one is making a real effort to learn to speak Spanish correctly and well. To add to this, listening to Michel Thomas, himself, is tedious and boring. Don't waste your money. Go for Pimsleur or Spanish Now! or Living Language. I am glad I only borrowed the CDs from a friend to preview them."
3,OK but could be a whole lot better,"I purchased this based on the reviews here. I was somewhat disappointed. This course goes very slowly and really does not cover much. It does teach you how to pronounce the words. But the same leason material is repeated over and over until it brought tears to my eyes.The format is that the instructor is teaching 2 students how to speak Spanish, a boy and a girl. The boy is kind of slow and the instructor has to keep correcting him. This became rather tiring after the first 10 or 20 leasons.Now learning to speak a language is only half the problem. You also must learn to understand the spoken words. This does not do a very good job training ones ear to understand the words because the sentences are short and spoken by the students who barely understand what they are saying and do not speak it with authority."
5,MTSPANISH,"A wonderful way for a beginner to learn Spanish. It is clear,and easy to understand.I would recommend it highly."
5,Spanish with Michel Thomas,"I am very pleased with this course, clear, easy to understand, convenient to listen to on the way to work."
4,Good for beginners,I found this CD set excellent for learning to pronouce words and also with grammar.
1,poor product,"I bought the deluxe course on the basis of these online reviews.This course is possibly the worst spanish course on the market.1. no native speakers2. minimal vocabulary3. minimal grammerafter all eight cds the course does not even begin to take the user to a conversational level. yes the participants can string words together, fantastic. The reason this course is touted as being so easy is that so little is taught. The vast majority of the time is spent correcting the male speaker. The contents of these eight cds can be condensed to about 2.do not buy this product.consider a more comprehenive course or for the same $50 you can buy LEARN IN YOUR CAR SPANISH by penton which although difficultcontains months of work tn the same 8cds."
4,Wow...,I can't believe no one has written a review of this disk yet. It's excellent. The songs have tons of energy and are catchy.It kind of sounds like the direction Soilwork should have taken instead of trying to sing. I strongly recommend this disk...
2,Publish Date Incorrect,"The publish date shown for this book is March, 1997, the book was actually written in the early nineteen hundreds. Dr. Hazzard D.O., did apparently fast hundreds of patients, however, the medical basis of her comments are very dated."
1,Psycho!,"This woman was a murderer and starved people to death. Even after numerous people had died, she still believed that fasting could cure many ailments. She was so dillusional that when she was diagnosed with cancer, she actually followed her own fasting diet and ended up dying from it."
3,cartoon festival,it was nice to watch and brought back some memories. too bad the new cartoons couldn't be as much fun to watch as the old ones.
1,Cartoon Festival 76 Episode Pack,This Cartoon Festival is of very old cartoons most from the 30s & 40s and in Black and White. The video is of poor quality and the sophistication is seriously lacking.
1,copier cartridge review,We didnt even run 50 copies with this new ink cartridge and something to happened so that all of our copies are barely readable because they are covered in ink. We never had a problem with our HP cartridges. We were just trying to save a litte money. I would not recommend this manufacturer.
3,Aretha Franklin's here too,"Because Amazon didn't, I'm posting this list of the tracks on this CD. ""FT"" means Four Tops, ""SRTM"" means Smoky Robinson & The Miracles, and ""AF"" means Aretha Franklin is featured on the track too.1. Santa Claus is Coming to Town, SRTM2. Merry Christmas Baby, FT3. Winter Wonderland, SRTM4. Christmas Here With You, FT & AF5. Let it Snow, SRTM6. Twas the Night before Christmas, FT7. Christmas Every Day, SRTM8. Away in a Manger, FT9. The Christmas Song, SRTM10. This Christmas, FT11. Silver Bells, SRTM12. Little Drummer Boy, FT13. I'll be Home for Christmas, SRTM14. Silent Night, FT & AF15. Noel, SRTM16. White Christmas, FT & AF17. O Holy Night, SRTM18. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, FTI assume that all these tracks have appeared on other CDs. I liked some much more than others, but enjoyed the chance to hear so many songs on one CD."
2,Film clips from their shows,Nostalgic Film Clips from their shows. My father likes comedy and enjoyed the trip down memory lane.
4,ok little puppet,"My almost 2 year old son is obsessed with chicks, eggs, and hatching. When I found this and saw it was Folkmanis I ordered it right away. He LOVES it. We play with it ALL THE TIME. However, I was disappointed in the puppet. The egg is not cloth like I had assumed it would be, it is latex, and smells like stinky latex. The chick is a little squashed in the face, not super cute. Personally I would have rated this at 2 or 3 stars at the most, but considering how much enjoyment we are getting out of it, and how unique the puppet is, I give it 4 stars."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD,"Greg Kihn is actually one of the best muscians I've heard in my lifetime but this LIVE album wasnt for me. The hit songs are all interupted by him talking and HE TALKS A LOT on this recording. HE talks nonsense almost as if he was drunk when he did this performance. This CD shoould have been a standup comedy album for all intents and purposes, but May i say he shouldnt quit his day job as a musician. Overall the song list was pretty decent but I recomend you buy his actual recording of these songs not this LIVE album. But I paid $5 so, it wasnt all that bad. IF your looking to collect his music then this CD is for you otherwise you WONT find anything good here."
2,Run-of-the-mill Christian fiction,"I was disappointed in the writing style of this book. I have read quite a bit of Christian fiction and sad to say a lot of it is mediocre, even though I always hold out hope for another Lori Wick, Francine Rivers or Beverly Lewis to come along. This book had a good plot premise but fell flat. It seemed a bit far-fetched to start off with having Mrs. O'Leary of Chicago Fire fame being one of the characters, and while I understand the concept of historical fiction, this took some big liberties. The dialog is too saccharine and trite, especially the endless 'mommy, mommy' by the little boy; and there is far too little depth in the descriptions of people and circumstances. I finished it, hoping it would get better but it was just too juvenile for me. Perhaps a teen audience would appreciate it better, although I can't say it seems like it was intended to be that way."
2,Secrets of the Heart,Basic love story with too much religious emphasis. Unlikely ending....I couldn't even finish it.
5,Works Well,This remote controller works well! The button is quite large and easy to push and the initial set-up is really easy to do. A great option if you need extra remotes!
5,nice,"This shipped quickly, worked out of the box. I can now open my garage again, thanks for keeping an old product around."
3,garage remote,Item arrived in new condition and withih a couple of days from being ordered.Would purchase from seller again.
5,Aboriginal Australian naked,Kenneally delivers to the reader a carefully crafted and authentic story which evokes the nature and conditions of living in the Australian Bush before the arrival of the motor car. The alienated spirit of Jimmy Blacksmith cannot rest. The author gives his characters a humanity that displays empathy and understanding without sugar-coating.Why otherwise good people do bad things and how that effects those involved is insightfully portrayed.James Pope
3,Decent book for group work,"This book has a pretty good amount of information on conflict resolution. It is laid out in a pretty organized, logical way. My only complaints are that it doesn't discuss enough about listening skills and that it is only geared towards the teen population (the case studies are VERY teen-specific)."
3,Tire pressure gauge,"The gauge works well. However, it woud be easier to use if it had a longer rigid section on the tyre connector. For older persons it would enable a firmer grasp of that section, since it requires both hands in practice (one hand is required to hold the meter section)"
3,Good gauge,"Somewhere someone had written that this gauge is made ""in the good ol' USA."" Well, it isn't. It's made in bad ol' China. I wouldn't have bought had I known; but live and learn. It functions well, but has that cheap, Chinese look to it, and had the famous Chinese ""burned rubber"" smell."
2,Only skims the surface,"The first chapter is a re-hash of the on-line tutorials in the game itself. The bulk of this paperback is taken up by descriptions of the various activities in the game. The different game editors are discussed in the last third of the book.If you're looking for better instructions on how to run the steam engines, look elsewhere. The on-line tutorials actually provide more information than is printed here. The authors claim it is ""impossible"" to go into more detail in the book. Disappointing."
2,Spend five minutes with it at the bookstore.,It is a nice book to scan in the bookstore. That's really all the time you need with it. The information that it provides is really worthless after you play the game a couple times. I would love for the coverage of the editor to be better. If you're thinking about buying the game and your not sure buy the book. It gives more detail than the box. But if you have passed the tutorials in the game the book is really not worth it.
2,Beginner's Manual,"This book is really a basic tutorial and not much else. A lotof space is dedicated to geographical description of the train routes and less to the technical issues, especially the Tools and Editors. The coverage for this topic is very elemetary. This is the kind of manual that used to come with the software. There are, however, some useful pieces of information which are not included in the MSTS documentation. It's a good place to start...but not to finish"
2,Pricey Book,Ife you must bye by cheap (new is about three times when it first come out).I dout that it has been updatedNo Secrets.Plenty of of secrets in the simulator itself
3,not what i expected,"First of all I must say that I love Lee Williams & The Spiritual QCs. I buy every CD and DVD that they record because they are one of favorite groups. This DVD ""Fall on Me"" was a dissappointment to me. I bought the CD and it seemed rather dull so I ordered the DVD and immediately felt as if they were holding back and not allowing the spirit to move in them. It is not the Lee Williams that I know and love. Most of the songs were more depressing than uplifting. I am still a fan but I pray that the next CD and DVD will be much better than this one. I also agree with the review about the poor quality of this DVD, the quality seem homemade and not professional. Lee we know that God has even greater things in store for you. I will continue to support you!"
4,bearing buddy,"Original BB product. If you know what this is, you know that BB is the gest producer of these items. I used ""lowest price"" to get the best deal."
5,Their best ever!,"You may be aware that Burn The Priest is now called Lamb of God. This is without a doubt their best album. It is B R U T A L!If you like LoG, you MUST get this album. If you are more in to shrink wrapped, corporate nu-metal... you won't understand this album."
5,"Brutal Cd, A must have!","i picked this cd up because a coworker and me were talking about different metal bands around the other day and he mentioned burn the priest. He told me that they were formally lamb of god and the whole history and the only way he could possible say to describe them was is that it was brutal and one of the most insane cds ever. It was so convincing i picked up the cd(i never do this) and the only thing i can say is wow he was right. This cd is more than brutal, its insane. The double bass, the vocals are leaps and bounds better than LoG in my opinion, and the guitar riffs are mind shattering. My favorite song is Bloodletting by far.....but all of them are amazing, if you like some good straight up metal, thats a lot heavier than lamb of god and most other metal bands out there today pick up this cd you wont be dissapointed. Its worth every penny. When i get mad i just blast this cd and wow....it makes me go crazy. Pick up this cd!"
3,O.K. (for a first album),"I've always thought that you have to give a band a little slack on their first release. BtP is really Lamb of God's first album. It has a lot going for it: it's brutal and heavy and the production is good (this is a re-release). Obviously, as a new band, they didn't have the songwriting maturity that they do now. There were times I heard hints of Pantera and even (if you take away the vocals) Black Sabbath. I think most LoG fans will appreciate this release. Don't buy this as your first LoG purchase. It's pretty good but not something I would recommend that people rush out and buy.Not bad but not recommended."
4,on the streets of new york,"again, the disaster remind us that middle aged punx can still do it. never mind roger's home, Agnostic Front, teh disasters prove that there is more than one way to get it out. while the music is what you'ld expect, straight up punk rock, tehy could have suspended tradition in leu of a slightly longer album, as the only flaw is it's over too soon. (that's why i mix it in the changer with ""another voice"", keeps it fresh!)all in all, another knock out punch."
2,waste if time,This CD wastes too much time on getting someone to relax and not enough time on reinforcement
3,Motivational but I wan't hypnotized,"I didn't expect to fall into a trance or anything like that. But I wasn't hypnotized. Meaning, I didn't find myself viewing food any differently from listening to this CD. I did however, find the message and mental imagery of my ""new"" and thin self to be motivational...especially the big white room part. It also helped me to relax and fall asleep. So I still listen to it when I'm having trouble sleeping."
1,I did not care for this CD,"I found the narrators voice to be sappy and phony. The pace was too slow for me personally. I have tried several times to just listen to the message, however this CD just does not work for me."
3,Ang in CA,"I haven't had too much success with this. The sessions are 40+ minutes. I don't know about anyone else but in my life, the only time I have that much time to myself is on the weekends. I realize I should MAKE TIME, but come on, it's not like I don't try. I wish the sessions were broken up into 15-20 minutes, so I could do on my lunch break (30min). So I'm not saying it works, I'm not saying it doesn't work, I'm saying it's tough to make that much time EVERYDAY. Heck anything that could MAKE me like excercise is worth trying, but by the time I excercise in a day I don't have time for the Hypnosis. That's irony for you!"
2,Annoying Voice,"I found the voice on this CD to be extremely annoying. I listened all the way through the first night, but the second night, I could only stand it for about 10 minutes. Unlike other reviews I read, I did not find her voice soothing nor relaxing. The speaking seemed unnatural, going to a high note in the middle of a sentence. One reviewer referred to this as ""lilting."" I just couldn't stand to listen to it, even though I thought the message was very good."
3,mixed feelings,"I was very pleased with the speedy delivery. I've only owned this for one week, and I am trying to increase my tolerance and committing to listening every day....I find that the first 20 minutes is unnecessarily long, as though Miss Rosa is trying not only to convince the listener, but herself as well to enter a state of relaxation....entirely too wordy. It takes too long to cut to the chase which ultimately is The Staircase....she also sounds like she's reading a picture book to a roomful of kindergardeners.....toward the end, which comes quite abruptly, she becomes very excitable, speaking very quickly, as though 3/4's of the way thru she realizes her recording time is almost up, and is scrambling to make an effective finish...the only redeeming quality is that you get 2 for 1, at the cost of $19.99....all in all, this is not the first suggestion I would offer up as a weight-loss cd"
4,Interesting,"The book has a good format. Each contributor presents his view, the others respond, and then the contributor replies to the responses.It presents a good introduction to four viewpoints on Christian salvation. I don't think anyone will change their mind as a result of reading, but the contributors did a good job, and you will find yourself intrigued. I personally found Hick's arguments to be weak (numerous places) and was a bit surprised that I agreed with McGrath more than the others."
5,Damn' good!!,"""City of Glass"" is not a simple adaptation from the original book, but a real translation, from literature to sequential art. Mazzuchelli's drawings provides a very good trip to Auster's universe, his unusual characters, enlarging at same time the limits of comics language. One of the best comic books ever!"
3,"Eh, it was okay.","City of Glass is a graphic novel interpretation of Paul Auster's well received book, originally published in 1985. Halfway through the graphic novel I picked up the original book to see how some of the wild imagery was portrayed in written form. I was surprised (though should I have been?) that there seemed to be greater depth to the literary version, which supplemented the imagery as I continued to move deeper into the graphic novel.The only reason I didn't give this work a better rating was due to the storyline building up in a way that insisted more in the end. I enjoyed the graphic novel, but after reading it I realized I would have appreciated the original even more. I feet it would probably be best to read the original novel and then try the shorter graphic version again...but I honestly have some difficulty committing myself to a detective yarn when I already know how it will end."
1,Poor,"Very cheap and poorly made, Did not hold up as it wore very fast. Never buy again as Belkin products are not the best"
4,it's good!,The mouse pad is really good for the price paid. I have been using this for a few months and it's good as new.
4,"I'd have preferred slightly bluer, but looks good","The picture is slightly purple, but it was called blue so I took a chance as it was cheap. This pad is blue enough that I would call it blue, but I can see why it looks slightly purplish in the picture. I'm fine with the color but would have liked slightly bluer towards an dark tropical ocean color.The surface is a nice cloth surface. Every cloth mouse pad I've had has de-laminated at some point, which is what happened to the last one. Usually takes years though so hopefully this lasts that long. For the price, this is was a good value."
1,Cheap,"Came apart after about a week. Not worth bothering with it. Laminations come unglued, Tried to fix, but is trash"
4,Mouse Pads,The mouse pads were exactly what was expected and they have worked as expected. I am completely satisfied with them.
1,Poor Quality,"The cloth has seperated from the rubber pad in 2 months. It only cost $1.99, but you would think it would last longer than that."
4,"Cheaply made, but cheaply priced","It's a basic mousepad with foam backing, and the cheapest option I've seen (assuming you can get it with free shipping). Cheap enough to justify the lightweight material. It is NOT the nice, heavy rubber backing that some people might expect.Works fine with optical and laser mice."
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"Price is good, but cloth surface quickly delaminated from the rubber backing at the edge where my palm and/or arm rests on the pad. Recommend spending 2 - 3 bucks more, and get more for your buck!"
2,Ok for light use. Overpriced.,I have purchased over 200 of these for my company. Users seem to destroy them every few months. The are really light and wont stick to the desk which means most of the time they move along with the mouse. I get them from my vendor for $1.25 but I just saw them on a major techie webstore for $0.99 cents. I wouldn't pay more than $3 or $4 for them.
2,"Good product, but not what I needed.","I would rather have a mousepad with a more slippery surface. It is a good, basic mousepad and very inexpensive."
4,mouse pad review,My new mouse pad is compatible with my mouse. I like the color (blue) and it fits fine beside my laptop. I feel silly as there is not much to say - but I was asked to review my purchase and here it is. Thank you Amazon !
3,mouse pad,They are a vivid blue and perfect for classroom use. They seem to be pretty durable. We use them daily in our preschool classroom.
4,Get a Razer if you play video games.,"Within 2 days of receiving this mouse pad, the bottom edge of cloth that my palm rests on started to peel and come off the rubber pad. Once it gets bad, I plan to superglue it to the pad, which should keep it attached for much longer. The reason I am still giving this 4 stars is because it was literally just 2 bucks; no tax, no shipping. You can't beat that deal. For gamers, I'd suggest going with a Razer mousepad. Once this one starts to really wear out, I plan on purchasing a Razer. But if you just want something cheap that maintains the basic functionality, look no further."
2,cheap mouse pad,It was cheap and simple. problem is we've only had it a short time and the cloth top is already starting to peel! i didnt want a temporary product.
1,Cloth cover came off within months,"The mouse pad I had before lasted for years. I even washed it in the machine and it still came out fine. When the backing finally started disintegrating, I bought this one. The cloth cover started coming off within weeks. Obviously, they are not gluing the covers properly. I will not buy this again."
2,Its ok,Ordered this for my desktop. Disappointed with quality.PROS:LargeCheapCONS:Blue part started peeling off after first week.
2,"Cheap, but cheap",This is the lightest mousepad I have ever felt. Doesn't even sit flat on the table.
1,Plastic top - NOT jersey as described,"The top of this mousepad is plastic, not jersey as described. Scratchy loud noise when used - less smooth tracking than a table top. Used for 30 seconds then tossed into the trash."
5,Decent for the price.,I got two of these. They are great for the price. They're lighter than expected which I was initially worried about but they seem to be working fine. Can't beat the price and I ordered them from Amazon.com through a great deal I found on DailyTool.com.
2,Inflexible and thick,After some time this pad's shape becomes concave. And it is too thick. Just spend extra 1 dollar and get twice better pad. I even stopped using this.
3,Nike Sports Watch (Black),"This is a very stylish and functional watch. It has a purposeful design and useful features for an active person. The display is good when one depresses the light, otherwise It can be difficult to see the numbers in poor light."
5,A funny thing happened on my way to the DVD player,"I love Hogan's Heroes, one of my favorite shows growing up, boy was I surprised when my season 1 DVDs were mislabeled. Disc 1 has Disc 2 labeling and vice versa. Hopefully this is a fluke and not the status quo."
5,Wow ! TV at it's best !,"This is one TV series that I have waited a long time for and it was worth the wait ! My wife and I remember watching this while growing up and are sharing this with our children (21, 17, and 10) and all three of them (plus my wife and I) roll over laughing !""I see nothing!""""Dissmissed""Can't wait for the rest of the seasons !"
3,"Great Show, No Extras","I think the show is wonderful, but the collection has zero extras. I also disliked the packaging; it seems cheap to me compared with other TV collections. The picture quality is very nice, but CBS should have made some sort of minimal effort to include something else. Yes, the set is less expensive than other TV collections, but this a 40-year old show, they are not paying residuals to the actors or anything. It's just disappointing that they didn't do a better job in honouring this great show."
4,Pilot edited???,A scene is cut out from this episode where Hogan calls Olsen on the radio telling him to come back.Hogan is seen calling him butb then it immediatly cuts to the arrival of Burkhalter.Columbia House has DVDs of the show two and in it's edition the scene is NOT cut. Im gonna compare the two and see if any of the other episodes are cut as well.
5,PURE HILARITY AND ENTERTAINMENT,GOOD QUALITY DVD. I'D FORGOTTEN HOW FUNNY ALL THE CHARACTERS WERE. PURE FAMILY FUN!
1,Hogans Heroes--The complete 1st Season,Very funny--Great Quality--It's good to see the entire episodes again without so many minuts being cut out of them for more and more meaningless commercials.
3,"Slice and dice, you won't miss what you don't know","I was very excited to get this first season of Hogan's Heroes on DVD. If you are a fan of the show who has only had the pleasure of watching it on late night UHF then the complete first season will be a great pleasure. The lack of special features will not upset you very much.If you however like myself you have the VHS tapes you will notice that the pilot is cut. Whole scenes are missing as well as key lines and jokes. I was planning to dump my VHS copes after buying this. I don't plan to do so now.As this is 17 hours of episodes I don't expect I'll notice every missing scene, but if you are going to make a collection is it too much to ask that the actual broadcast episodes as opposed to the cut versions (for extra ads) from UHF be used? I would think not but apparently we beggers can't be choosers.My advice is to pick up the VHS versions whenever possible, but for episodes not available this collection will fill the bill."
5,RIP Gen. Berkhaltar,"In one episode Newkirk asks Kinch ""Who's on the coffee pot today?"" Kinch replies ""Klink & Berkhaltar."" Newkirk says ""Turn it up. They're my favorite comedy team."" He was right- Werner Klempner (Klink) and Leon Askin (Berkhaltar) worked very well together.Leon Askin died June 3rd 2005 at the age of 97! As a young Jewish actor in Austria in the 30s he was arrested- and TOURCHERED- by the Gestapo! They released him (!) and Askin headed for the USA where, 30 years after that moment, he got the final revenge on those Gestapo clowns not only by out living them but by making fun of them. (Working s a translator for the US Army during the War didn't help the 1000 Year Reich much either!) Mel Brooks once defended his Hitler parodies by saying ""wit is deadlier than the sharpest dagger!"" That also applies to Askin, as well as Klempner and John Banner (Schultz), all Jewish actors who escaped Austria and made fools of the Nazies with ""Hogan's Heroes""!Leon Askin: 1907-2005."
4,Simple review...for a change,"* The DVD picture and sound are very good. This is amazing, considering the material is 40+ years old.* There are no bonus features...disappointing"
4,Great series ... DVD quality is poor,"Hogan's Heroes is one of those series which you just can't stop watching. There is always a great laugh.Unfortunately the DVD quality leaves a lot to be desired. DISCs 1 and 2 are mis-labeled. DISC 2 suffers from technical problems in the remastering. One of the worst tracks on DISC 2 was Happiness is a Warm Sergeant. The episode tended to jump back in a loop during certain parts, the sound would go in and out, and some other annoying glitchs.It is a shame that the quality control for this release is so poor."
4,"Nice, different, works well","Very nice finish and everyone who sees it remarks on how unsual it is. Many people aren't quite sure how it works until they try it. The one I ordered came with one very (very) small imperfection on the back of the body. Since it was in a spot where no one would see it and water should not hit, I didn't return it but you may feel differently. The only other concern I have is that the waterfall of water is difficult to control. Right now it works fine but flows slightly off to one side. Oh yes, there were no instructions included but if you have any experience with installing faucets you should have no problems."
5,Where is it?,"I've been waiting a long time for this movie to come out on DVD, but it is only good in Region 2! When the heck is a version going to come out for us red-blooded American folks here in Region 1?"
4,Great concept for storyline,"Back in the 80s when this was made, i think it was a pretty good flick, it has a weak plot though and some areas could have been expanded upon. But the idea of this movie is so original, I like the idea of our guys stealing one of our own nukes to threaten the Russians who stole some of our nuclear fuel to make a bomb and put it in the Saudi oil fields in an attempt to get the Israeli's off the west bank. It feels like a class B movie, but it is enjoyable all the same. This movie would make a great remake if done today, and considering some of the garbage that has been released lately, this one would be a big hit."
5,Excellent!,"This seller managed to get my sign to me in time for Christmas when I only ordered a few days before! The sign was perfect! It was very carefully packaged, and well worth the money."
1,Just a bit dogmatic,"There are so many ways to quilt, so many systems, and not all work for everyone. However, this author seams (pun intended) to believe in the old saying...""My way or the highway"". She is very disparaging of any method other than hers, bringing an assertive and unpleasant tone to the book. Certainly not an atmosphere conducive to learning, especially something that can be so enjoyable. I'm sorry I wasted my money!"
5,Sought after Beckham Jacket 2006,Finally... Iv'e been trying to get this adidas replica jacket through eurosport for months! What lamers. I'll add more when my jacket arrives but if its like my other beckham adidas prditor apperal; it will have an excellent fit great material lasting for a lifetime.This jacket Rocks like all addidas appearel. Rare jacket show it off on the street. My advice is if you run accross this jacket don't hessitate to buy it for it's rare to find.
1,Very Disappointing,"I consider myself to be one of the biggest Elaine Paige fans ever, certainly in the US. I was so excited to hear that this release was coming, and equally as disappointed to hear it.It is a soft hushed style of singing, with odd arrangements and often it feels like the orchestration drowns out her singing.Someone Else's Story is the one I was REALLY waiting for since Chess is my favorite musical, but sadly it is just as disappointing as the rest. To have a voice as powerful and as magnificent as Elaine's and then to not have it come across on the recording is puzzling.I never thought I could say this, but there is really no reason to get this CD. Her other music really stirs the soul but there is nothing on this CD that has this effect. The song selection was brilliant, but it was a wasted opportunity."
2,Only TWO Songs Make This Mandatory...,"Ditto to ALL the negative comments you'll read from the other reviews here... but two songs make this a must-buy for any lover of Elaine Paige: ""You Must Love Me"" and ""Someone Else's Story"". And Thank God these are the only two songs where the orchestrations don't destroy the original melody. These songs ""complete"" the characters that Elaine originated on stage(especially for CHESS), and Elaine's vocals are just fine on both numbers. However, how she could destroy OTHER songs from shows she's appeared in(HAIR and SUNSET BOULEVARD in particular) is totally beyond comprehension. Outside an ""Andrew Sisters"" swing version of ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair"", I don't think you'll be listening to this CD more than once."
1,Poor arrangements & orchestrations,"Like a few other reviewers, I was really looking forward to hearing this CD based upon the excellent song lineup Elaine had chosen. Her Centre Stage double CD is a treasure, and I could just hear Ms. Paige deliver some definitive versions of these great showstoppers. However, this is a rotten album; the arrangements are off-beat, discordant, and distracting. As the CD played through, I kept hoping the next track would be better, but each successive song was just as unpleasant as the one prior. We waited two or three years for this mess? Sad. This was a real missed opportunity to deliver a superior collection of classics. What a bomb."
1,Shakespeare Synergy 15 Reel,"The reel seemed to work quite well last year when I used it about 5 times. However, this year I took it out and found that the drag was locked up and couldn't be adjusted. I will contact manufacturer to see if there any suggested fixes. It may be that it was not designed for brackish water use and that corrosion developed over the winter??? Also the reel seemed to be a little on the heavy side and was sometimes difficult to cast properly on a 5.5' rod. Maybe on a different rod this may not happen."
5,Always Buy OEM Genuine Toner for your Laser Printer,Always Buy OEM Genuine Toner for your Laser Printer. It may cost a little more than refilled / remanufactured toner but it will keep your laser printer needing a cleaning longer. The refilled toner shortens the life of your laser printer.Ways around the cost of OEM genuine toner is to troll the Amazon and Ebay and pay up to 70% off retail.
2,Horrifically expensive but unfortunately necessary.,"Stratospherically priced like all HP branded toner cartridges. The toner price is probably the reason for the recent major price reduction on the 3005 series.However, hp cartridges do last longer than the replacements and will not gum up your printer. Luckily, I managed to get mine for less than $100."
5,Not just for nerds (though it helps...),"Tired of the same-old gags in your newspaper comics? Looking for a new comic artist to enjoy? Perry's perspective on high school life (the highs, the lows, the inane) is refreshing. (And funny.)"
2,Do not go by Amazon compatibility chart,I am not the only one who was told that these were compatible with my car and they simply ARE NOT. Amazon compatibility chart is INCORRECT.
2,Does not fit BMW as the site said,"I had to force it in after enlarging the holder in order to fit. Also, it leaves streaks after a few uses."
5,On Cloud Nine,"A must for all Higher Octave Music lovers, this sampler, released in 1997, features a cool selection from some of the best groups in the genre - 3rd Force, William Aura, Craig Chaquico. What's special is that it's also a CD rom loaded with free stuff, like a music video of 3rd Force's Here Comes the Night. It's truly music for the cyberactive mind, cool grooves to satisfy the new age mind, body and soul, great music for creative writing."
3,Just what I expected--a little light reading,"I have read this entire series as a little light reading for those evenings when I don't want my brain to work. I thoroughly enjoyed the flow of the story, even with the predictable ending. The light personalities are a bit sketchy, but drawn nicely enough that I pretty much got the picture. The characters remind me of my aunts and their friends. They'd be the type to get into just the same type of mischief as Sister Mary Helen and crew. If you liked the other Sister Mary Helen books, you'll like this one. If you thought the others were too much fluff for your liking, then this is no different."
1,Bad copy of part of an old book,Recommend a visit to the library to look at the original book by C. Baldwin as this is just an excerpt from the book and is almost illegible.
5,great read....for anyone,The book is comptivating and an easy read. It has sparked an interest as to what happened after the end of Alexander the Great. It also has me wanting to understand what he was like just a little more. Anyone wanting to learn a little about history and a great warrior would find this book of interest.
4,A fun primer on Alexander,"Cleverly written from the perspective of a boy in the Macedonian court, this book provides a gentle and reasonably accurate, if glossed over, introduction to Alexander for young readers. (Note: I read the translated version, since I am not familiar with modern Greek.)"
4,Very ineresting film,"This is an Hindi classic that is the story of very, very realistic poor Indian village everyone ought to view."
5,brilliant film.....,"This is the second installment in the ""Apu Trilogy,"" by masterful Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray.Apu (Pinaki Sengupta, as the young Apu and Smaran Ghosal, as the adolescent) has relocated with his mother (Karuna Bannerjee) and father (Kanu Bannerjee) to Banares. Apu's father is working as a medicine man there, and Apu is very ambitious to start school with the other young boys. This follows the life of this family, its joys, struggles and the choice Apu must make to either pursue the life of his father (as a priest) or venture out to Calcutta, as a scholarship student, to build a foundation for himself.This film was shot beautifully and is really a great example of marvelous storytelling. Also, the acting is brilliant. The two young men who portray Apu as a child and a young man are wonderful and engaging--particularly Pinaki Sengupta whose eyes say so much in the scenes between him and his parents that there is very little need for dialogue. Beautiful......."
4,Protect colored hair from chlorinated pools with this cap.,"I've been using this brand/style cap for years, but I needed a new one. There is no other swim cap designed to protect ones hair when swimming in a chorinated pool."
4,"Cheap, and very amusing.","As usual I was wary about cheap movies. But I enjoyed it. Better than some ""blockbusters"" which can be boring. Lotsa gore. Funny. Worth the price."
4,evil aliens,"to me this is a solid four it kinda a comedy but serious and little different it has alo t of different act and aliens, really can understand the low star from others but hey dumb is dumb and ther planty out there, really i have ten thousand movies i know what im talking about but i cant make peoples IQ go up from dumb."
4,I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD HATE IT!,"The beginning scene was a massive, disgusting, puke all over my couch scene. I really did not puke...but I could have if I had any food in my stomach. All in all, I laughed quite hard during this movie. I was not expecting to like it as much as I did. To be one hundred percent honest, this is the kind of movie that you will either love or hate it. For a low budget film, they did one heck of a job!"
1,The Perfect Travel Bag,"5 Star Item! Have carried this bag all over the world- now buying it in taupe. It's large: 12 1/2"" length, 10"" tall, 2 1/2"" width. Security features abound: 6""clip strap attached inside purse for zippered coin purse w/ clear ID space, inside zippered compartment, inside 2 divided sections; outside zippered flap with credit card slots plus zippered internal pocket, outside snap-closing pocket for tix, magazine, outside and side open pockets, etc. It's got so much going for it the big problem is remembering where you stashed everything! Well made, heavy microfiber fabric. Steel cable in adjustable strap. Can use inside clip strap to secure primary bag zippers or the outside zippered flap. I also have the fanny pack."
3,There's just... something wrong here,"Now, I don't claim to be either the biggest comic book nerd or literary critic but let me just preface and say that I really did like this arc. I loved the threat of natural disaster out of left field, I like the way it brought out new sides of all involved, I even liked the quasi-philosophy of Ras Al'Gul and the weird turn with the Penguin alliance.My problem is and shall remain, that... this is in the DC universe. We consider this earthquake to be so devastating because Gotham's resident hero is a crime fighter, a detective, with no power over the natural elements, but to be honest, I couldn't go a page without screaming, ""Where's Superman?! Where's the Flash and the Green Lantern?!"" These other heroes that supposedly coexist in this world, who could come in and fix the problem and save countless lives, are simply discarded for plot convenience and as such, on the deepest of levels, this really doesn't make sense."
2,Pretty Boring,"There's at least a dozen better Batman stories out there. This one throws in the usual earthquake cliches, the Huntress's usual rants, repeated deification of Bruce Wayne regarding the quake-proofing of his real estate, and so many ham-handed attempts at heart-string-tugging that you'll think you're a cadaver in a medical school. (That was a terrible metaphor, wasn't it? I'm very sorry.) There's really three plot threads: the destruction caused by the quake, a Blackgate breakout, and the ""Quakemaster."" The whole Quakemaster subplot is just awful; I was hoping that he would actually level the rest of the city just so the story would end. The best sequences are three short vignettes with Two-Face, Penguin, and Leslie Thompkins. As a final complaint, the book is cheap. Physically, as well as literally. Cheap paper."
4,Great Read but.....,"Overall a great book. Gotham City faces something worse than even the Joker or Penguin could do to it, Earthquake! Batman battles those who come out of the darkness to take advantage of the destruction while Bruce Wayne fights to save his city politically. Only mistake I made was reading the No Mans Land Comics(which were even better) before I read this so It spoiled some of the suspense for me. I would advise against doing that."
5,Exceptional Suspense and Plot,I was very impressed with the plot of Thief in the Dawn. My heart pounded as I traveled the frighning journey of Mandie in the Florida Keys. It was truley a suspensful love story that kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. The steamy love scenes and building supense were very well done in this authors first novel.
2,Poor quality rewinder.,"I had one of these and I replaced it with a Gemini 2 way rewinder which is of a much higher build quality and runs more reliably than this one. The problems I experienced with this Ambico rewinder are: Very noisy, flimsy construction, Door getting stuck at times, Some tapes actually got tangled inside the reel of the tape itself while rewinding the last 12 inches or so. Like I said, if you can still find a Gemini rewinder go for it and ditch this piece of garbage."
4,Would be really great if...,"This 2 way rewinder works great! Insert the tape, press Fast Foward or Rewind close it up and it's done in no time. BUT the ""counter"" feature that would idealy help you locate a certain spot on your video tape is the antiquated type that starts off at ""000"". I pushed FF on a tape that was listed as ""aprox. runnig time 60 min."" and the counter showed up at 875? Huh? Not too convenient!"
4,Fabulous movie but Beware-Dubbed!,"Fabulous movie...unfortunately, it was dubbed into english with an actress that sounded NOTHING like Gina Lollabrigida.I would not have bought it if I had known that it was dubbed. Otherwise, perfect!"
3,"Yerra, Be-Jaysus, not another one of the lot","Another dreadful sceal on mBealoideas e seo (a story from the folklore this is)about the horrors of Loife in Oul' Oireland, the bogs, mud, eternal rain, crucified mothers, drunken, good-fer-nothin' Da's, poverty so crushing it could be called Gaelic, emotional poverty so deep it's a wonder everyone doesn't commit suicide. Except they are Catholic, with all of those penitential burdens. They just run off--to Sasana, Boston. This story needs Myles na gCopalin to do it justice. Are any people as deeply self-deprecating as the Irish? Are they soon to be done with this penitential flogging of themselves in books and go back to ascending Croagh Patrick barefoot? My relatives came out of County Galway, Irish speaking, long ago and had as much good as bad to say about the Old Country. I wish this guy, who can write, at least in short bursts, would lend his story-telling more balance.That said, he has promise when he matures."
5,Excellent rhythmic spacemusic,"This is an excellent CD to use as either listening material or auditory input to relax. Spacemusic that features ""world rhythms"" (frame drums, tablas, etc.) that work well together. Similar to Steve Roach. IMHO, much better than ""Brainscapes"" since they dropped the diggerdoo(what is this instrument adding to music? I think it just must be fun to play). Excellent recording quality. All the tracks are great. END"
2,Not very helpful,"Was hoping book would be helpful, but it was not. Some of the links were out of date and the sites were not intuitive. Some sites required money to download any information. The book itself did not pulled together any information on frozen shoulder. Over 3/4 of the book was general information on researching any medical condition. Frozen shoulder hurts, I would'nt waste my money or hope on this book."
3,Hmmmmmmmmmmm,"I did not read this book quickly. This is unusual for me. This was a slow starter and then I just slowly moved through the book until about 1/3 of the way through. Maybe it is because I am not a frequent reader of the ""English"" mystery -- although I do really enjoy contemporary mysteries. I also like mysteries that ""teach"" me something. This book got me into antique and collectible books and kept my interest in discussions about the Masons, revisionism, forgeries, book clubs (Folio B), publishers and revisionism. I enjoyed this book after all of my adjusting to the ""English-ness"" of it all."
3,ehhh.,Hard to comment. I'm more of a Couture Couture fan so I just wasn't really impressed. Was kind of a strong smell to me.
1,gave it to my grandmother.,cuz it smells like old lady. nothing like juicy. a little disappointed. it was a blind buy so i knew it would be a hit or miss and it was a miss for me.
3,It's all right,"I got this so that the fish in my tank would have a chance to hide from my baby red-eared sliders, who have gotten way too good at hunting. It works well for that purpose (though the turtles have managed to shove themselves into it a few times-- they are beasts) but it looks kinda cheap and boring. Very dentist-office-y, but sometimes that's what you're going for!"
1,Not Worth It.,"Don't judge a book by its title or author. I expected some more insight into the world of biotech and pharma, instead what I got amounted to no more than a school girl reminiscing about her college days. Robbins-Roth proves herself adept at name dropping and anecdotal stores which in the end amount to nothing. Even worse are the endless lists of companies which could be downloaded from any of a hundred internet sites or the black & white charts which are basically unreadable.Don't waste your money.For real insight in the world of Biotech, get a copy of The Billion Dollar Molecule."
4,Good introductory text and overview of the industry,"I read From Alchemy to IPO for an MBA course on entrepreneurialism in the pharmaceutical industry. Given my background (undergraduate business, financial analyst role, limited in-depth scientific knowledge), I found this book to be a very useful and balanced guide to both the business and technical aspects of biotechnology.Robbins-Roth includes enough information on initial public offerings (IPOs) and merger activity among biotech firms to warm the hearts of the most resolute business student, but the drug discovery and development process is also covered in sufficient detail to give the lay reader an understanding for the operational challenges faced by firms in this sector.Add to this the competent yet necessarily superficial descriptions of more esoteric terms such as monoclonal antibodies and combinatorial chemistry, and you have a solid text that covers the industry and its ongoing challenges very well."
4,the perfect book to start with,"after reading this book, i took an online biotech seminar at fool.com that suggested all subscribers to read this book... luckily i did and found the seminar to be more interesting than i had thought.this book essentially gets you through the basics about biotech... from how a drug is discovered, tested, approved and marketed. you will learn about the industries various facets; financial, technical, biological etc.highly rated and a wise choice indeed!"
5,"Well written, fast paced, yet thorough","The author's expertise in science, finance, management strategy, and journalism all pay off in this very well written book. It's both lively and fact-packed, with quite a few tables covering dozens or hundreds of IPOs in the biotech industry. It gives a spectrum of biotech probably much broader than what any one reader would be familiar with. In a few places, I would have liked a bit more detail: for example, in the IPO chapter, a paragraph about exactly what the investment bank ""does"", how it ""does"" it, what its risks are in taking on an IPO, etc."
5,Excellent overview for the non-scientist,"I have to say this is required reading for anyone with an interest in biotech - be it they have a PhD and working in industry, or an MBA student with aspirations of getting into it. It's relatively up to date, contains great explanations of some very esoteric technologies, and puts it all into a business perspective."
3,decent primer for those starting in the industry,"the author's tone was a bit weird at times, and the organization was poor at times, but nonetheless a decent basic primer on biotech innovations for those starting out business or investing in the industry"
3,Not Exactly What I Had In Mind,"I am a student planning on majoring in molecular biology, with the goal of getting into a biotechnology company. I thought that this book was going to have a little more technical information, but I found that it was mainly a book geared towards investors, not students, or scientists. It has a lot of interesting information on how companies start up, and stock info, but this book is definately not for a person who is mainly interested in the science."
4,Good Introduction,"For someone interested in investing in Biotech and wanting to do homework, this a great book to start with. I have read it twice."
5,COFFEE,"JUST RECEIVED. SM. AIR TIGHT INDIVUAL POT PACKAGES. EXCELLENT AROMA. EXCELLENT TASTE. WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN FOR SURE SINCE I LIVE ALONE, THE LARGE BAGS OF FLAVORED COFFEE OFTEN SIT IN THE CUPBOARD AWHILE."
3,Just average,Wasn't bad.. wasnt' good. Just average.. bit below average I think. Usually I find hazelnut coffee a amazing experince. Wont be purchasing this one again.
4,Jess and her comming into her self and power.,"I picked this book for my Girl Scout troop to read over the summer.I just loved it and can't wait to order more by this author and in this series.Jessica is a high school girl with a hi sprit.She is very protective of her older brother. That protective side to her gets her into trouble.She has a wonderful girl friend - Ruth, who she has known forever.She is struck by lightning and begins to know where missing children are.This changes her life in many ways.I also love the chracter - Rob. He sounds like any boy that a head strong girl would love.This is a great book for ages 11 to 15. I'm 36 and I loved reading it - I think you will too."
3,"Hey, that's a book of psychic you're telepathic-ing!!","after two-days of reading, i found that this book is particularly satisfying. The writer is very superbly creative in bringing the characters alive, as such Jess Matsriani's character as a 16-year-old-teenager who doesn't give a damn about what other people thinks about her and this girl is quite a pain-on-the-butt.However, there is some part of the book in which I think is a little irrational.Do Jess's psychic powers do come out when she's sleeping? Obviously, I think telepathicp power works when someone's awake. I don't know why it goes that way but maybe Meg Cabot wants to make the story a little uncanny."
4,a lot better then I expected,"While the story of a teenager with superpowers is getting a little over done, Jenny Caroll makes this story a winner becuase of her fantastic protagonist, Jessica Mastriani a proud tomboy who loved playing the flute and riding on motercycles with equal passion. Other characters like Doug, Ruth and Roy are pleasant departures from the typical cliches in teen books. Also caroll's writing is above par. I'm looking foward to reading the sequal."
3,"Good idea, needs some work","I enjoyed the book When Lightning Strikes, but I think that it needs some more work. The story is really interesting and unusual but it doesn't play out as well as it could. I enjoy Meg Cabot's other series much better and think that they are better written. I did enjoy the book enough though that I am going to read the next book in the series, Code Name Cassandra."
1,Pretty disappointing....,"When I picked up this book, I had high expectations because Jenny Carroll did a great job with her other book series, The Mediator. I was disappointed. This book didn't keep me laughing or suspended and I found many errors about the military base, what with my father being in the military. This book was so boring that it took me a few weeks to read. When I picked the book back up, it was with hesitation. This book was a total let down and I recommend The Mediator series to everyone, not this series. I won't even bother reading the rest of the 1-800-WHERE-R-YOU series."
1,"Read her other series, The Mediator","It was hard to get in touch with this chacter. While I'm by no means a goody-goody, I've only had detition once in my life (stupid gym class). So i didn't have much in common with chacter, nor could i figure her out. she seems to have a death wish and she doesn't seem too friendly either. i'm not saying shes has to be prefect. she can be detiotion girl all she wants, but she reminded me of the main chacter in Demon in My View. they both seem angry at the world for no reason.the mitary base where she is taken too and the army guys there are all very sterotpyical. while i'm not saying our government is perfect, i'm tired of these conspriy theory stories. yes, big brother is watching you, but he's not right on top of you. she was risking national secruity by not giving all the names she knew.read the The Mediator or the author (under her real name) other series, the Princess Daires. just leave this mess be"
2,cant see,i t dose what it says but the white splatters are not thay visible for rifle at more then 25 yards. might be good for postal or .22 at close range
3,Dirty bird targets,"Cheaper version of shoot n c targets but not as good. Non-adhesive, harder to see and still pricey. Ok for handgun shooting, but beyond 10 yds they are difficult to see without a scope."
2,"Dirty Bird Target with 16 - 3"" targets per sheet","Yep, these targets (12 sheets of 16 - 3"" targets) really are NON adhesive backed. If you want to separate the 3"" targets and put them on cardboard or a larger white target, you're going to have to cut each 3"" target off the sheet and affix them (glue or rubber cement) to your larger target. Otherwise you have 16 - 3"" targets touching each other which doesn't make much sense unless you are shooting at very close range or have a very accurate gun with a very good scope. Great targets but why not have them adhesive backed?"
5,Now I see it !,"Great product.I was having a hard time seeing my shots on the biege targets I was using at 15 yards, now I see them all. Great deal, well worth it."
5,An excellent in-depth look at a football coaches preparation,"Run to Daylight was published in 1963 and was instantly recognized as a classic. Written by legendary Green Bay Packer head coach Vince Lombardi, RTD details Lombardi and the Packers preparation for an unnammed opponnet in the 1962 championship season. The book is a must read for the aspiring coach or anyone interested in pro football coaching. RTD provides the psychological motivation of both the players and coaches and a highly readable account of a week in a pro football season. Along with John Wooden's ""They Call Me Coach"", this is a must read for coaches of any sport."
3,fine and definitely not prog,"Fans of Spock's Beard rushing to buy this album may be slightly disappointed that this album lacks the musical noodling that marks them out as prog rock leaders, the rest of us will simply be relieved. This is an album of solid songs well sung. It has the rough, live feel that Morse was clearly looking for - particularly the drumming and the songs benfit from that. Some of the album is a bit aor and the quality dips by the end where some of the songs are a bit too long but overall an enjoyable album."
1,Oh No They Didn't!,"SoundTracks 1-2 and 3 were great. Ive listened to them constantly since the first day I got them. Two of them are in my car now. In one of the interviews with a QAF Director, the director said people all over the world send him music that they hope get played on the show....So, why in the world would you take the absolute worst songs people send you, and call it Season 4? The opening track is good...But the other songs? Its like Jazz with a mix...Not at all what I expected and not at all what I'll listen to. Better luck next time...."
3,Kind of a sleeper,"What a let down after the first three seasons. I was expecting some true QAF club music that I can hardly stop listening to. Instead, it is full of a lot of slow, sappy songs. I am sure this CD won't get played too much."
4,Great volume in the series,"Honestly, this cd is worth the price for ""Cue the Pulse to begin"" alone. As others have said, that right there should get you to buy this cd without hesitiation. But, there are other fantastic songs on this cd that are equally great and make this cd satisfying. It ends, for instance, with ""Wonderful Life"" by Black. I hadn't heard that for almost 15 years or so, when I first had the Black full length cassette, which had an equally awesome song on it called ""Everything is Coming Up Roses"" that got tremendous airplay here in SF. So, point being, it was great to see the song included here, and brought back great memories, outside of the fact that it's a song with a great message.Other songs on here...yes, others have mentioned, some are weaker than others. But overall, you get a great deal. Highly recommend this cd as something of a middle ground when you want something other than the constant thumpa-thumpa of Club Babylon.Enjoy."
5,Just like the fourth season: completely brilliant!,"Like this season of Queer as Folk, the music is delightfully dark and mature. It seems that in order to keep with the feel of the season, they had to change the sound and format, and by taking a risk, the fourth season soundtrack definitely works!This season takes us beyond Babylon, to the lives and struggles of the protagonists, rather than showing them having a great time dancing at the club, and I feel the soundtrack nicely mirrors this, with songs with an edge.I thoroughly enjoy this season more, and this soundtrack more, than previous seasons besides the magical first season. If you like what you see presently, this CD is highly recommended!"
1,What happened here?,I purchased the Season 4 soundtrack with anticipation of greatness and what I found was certainly a let down. This is the worst of all the soundtracks; I was expecting so much more. When they started this new season with this great new opening and the Cue to Begin song I thought wow. The music that is in the show is so much better than what they placed on the soundtrack. The mix that was chosen for Cue to Begin was a sad one and a major let down. The mix that is actually on the show is so much better and I guess that I was expecting to hear something similar. I would not suggest purchasing this seasons sountrack and hopefully they will hear our pleas for better music in the future. The first three seasons are worth the purchase.
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!,"For anyone hoping that this new cd of Season 4 music will be anything like the previous season discs....you will be VERY disappointed. There is basically one song (out of 14) that has anything resembling a happy dance song. The remaining 13 songs run the gamut from dull to boring. It sounds like if someone made a greatest hits package of pretentious, mid 80's Euro-pop. Previous QAF soundtracks have always been our ""Summer Pride Anthems"", but this one wouldn't even belong in a chillout room. It's just depressing..."
2,Utterly Disappointing....,"If you love the excellent QAF Second Season CD or Third Season's CD1 then this Fourth Season CD is NOT for you. Save your money!!! However, if you're a fan of CD2 from Season Three then you will probably like this disc but don't rush out (..). I agree with the previous reviewer. Wait until it hits the bargain bin because there are actually 3 or 4 good songs on the disc."
2,WORTH BUYING JUST FOR THE MARC BOLAN SAMPLE,"Being the 4th I really didn't expect nothing that brilliant, I find that with Queer as Folk 90 per-cent of the good stuff never makes the official soundtrack....but hey!......if you're a Marc Bolan fan it is well worth buying for the Jason Nevins' track ""I'm the main man"", taking total credit for Marc Bolan/T.Rex's ""Telegram Sam"" which was number one back in the UK in 1972, it's brilliant, it's fabulous, timeless and so full of energy. I don't mind this guy taking the credit if it means Marc's music gets listened to by a whole new generation. Looking at Amazon.co.uk, the track is to be released September 6th...wow can't wait. With regard to the rest of the soundtrack it was great to hear Black's ""Wonderful life"". At the end of the day, if you've bought the other three soundtracks I think you know what to expect by now."
1,Just plain awful!,"The previous three seasons of soundtracks from the Television shows was great. Season three's dance mix disc is 100% energy and fun! However, the second disc from the season three package was very strange and incongruent with the dance music theme. This latest installment from season four is delving further into the strangeness mentioned. I was ready for upbeat, uplifting, power dance oriented motivational music. Instead, I got a bland, boring, Quaalude party downer of a CD. I'll never play it again. Okay, I KNOW that not all gay people like dance music, so if that's the case, then don't buy dance music CDs. QAF discs are supposed to be dance music as that's the whole scene of the show. I know there's other music out there, but it doesn't belong on a QAF disc. All I can say to the executive producers of this product is ""Whatever!!!"" Save you money and don't bother with this lame compilation."
2,Change for the sake of change?,"This CD sounds like a cross between early Pearl Jam and a bad acid trip. While a departure from the thumping dance beat is welcome, there is much better music of this genre out there. Overall, it's just a bad mix."
2,Disappointing,I have to agree that this latest installment of the QaF series pretty much sucks. I don't mind that it's not all dance music - although that would have been my preference - but most of the cuts are just boring. I don't remember the music in the show being this bad. Just a bad selection of the season 4 music???I recommend a pass on this one.
1,Cool Water Deep by Davinoff,"Cool Water Deep by Davinoff bad quality, no the same as in the pass...old ? expired?"
3,Same old chick-lit complaints,"She can't find a guy who's good enough for her. A pretty standard rehash of all the usual dating problems, especially for women as they get older. (Older men remain desirable, damn it!)It is better written than most of the genre and the author is a fitness enthusiast, which adds a different and interesting dimension to her story. At one point she examines her life, determines what she wants and relocates to a small town in Oregon which seems pretty good. But it doesn' meet her needs re: men, so she's off again to pursue the elusive Mr. Right.It's possible to be a happy, single, older woman. I'd love to see a book that celebrates that!"
3,"1,000 nights without is a big deal?","The premise for this book is nothing special, and I can't say I feel sorry for the author as she bemoans her carnal drought. Plenty of people have gone far longer without intimacy -- some never experience it. The author displays a witty and engaging style, but as someone whose own drought has extended to 12,560 nights (I'm the same age as the author) I don't exactly consider her tale high adventure."
2,"OK, so I'm not alone","When I happened upon this book, I thought, ""Ha, sounds like me!"" and picked it up. So, yes, as I suspected, I am not the only one who is looking for the right guy, and encoutering a lot of wrong guys along the way. That being said, do I really need to read about somebody else's bad dates, followed by more bad dates? Not really. I'm also not interested in somebody else's escapes from reality, cycling events or oddball family (I have one too). Schlosberg is an amusing writer, and I won't NOT read one of her books again, but I just didn't get much out of this book. I didn't learn what to do, or not what to do. I knew it already - just wait it out!"
5,Made me laugh again!,"I bought ""Singles Table"" on the advice of a friend.... While going through a really bad break up of a long term relationship he seemed to think that I would relate to this book... and Ohhh was he ever right!!... This is the book that brought me back from the brink of being one of the bitter ""I hate men"" ladies - to actually having hope that it's not over... That it won't be... and that there are still actually 'good guys' out there...I just know that if Suzanne can go through this long journey and find her man... mine can't be far behind!!..WONDERFUL book....be ready to laugh so hard you snort and try not drinking while reading!!.... lol... For anyone who has ever just 'had enough'...Buy this book ASAP!!!"
1,Confused,"i thought I was downloading a books called Sisters, but I got a book about things to see and do in Boston."
2,Glean the Best and Toss the Rest,"This book is a mixed bag. As you will see from some of the other reviews there are good points, but if you are in a difficult marriage, or just want to improve your marriage, you could find more help in books that focus on your love relationship with God, such as books by: Bob Sorge, or the book by Beth Moore ""Praying God's Word - Breaking Free From Strongholds""."
3,Mixed reviews...,"As a spouse that is standing for their marriage (what you'd call a prodigal spouse) I cannot say that I have seen any results with the prayers. I find them to be written as a ""one size fits all"" for marriages, husbands, or wives. I have had other friends and relatives who have had great results by praying Stormie's prayers... But I, on the other hand have a little more complicated situation for the Lord to handle. Some of the prayers do not apply to my marriage and I skip over those. I have had the book since summer of 2008 and have repeatedly prayed them multiple times to no avail. I have seen more response from God by my own, self-generated prayers than this book. It is a lovely book and is written by someone who seems very kindhearted. But I do not find it to be helpful."
5,Wonderful Book of Prayers,I love this book. The prayers express the unconditional love of a wife. The author also relates the prayers to her own personal experiences with her husband. It has helped me to have faith in the power of prayer when my marriage was in crisis. I also purchased the audio CD to listen to while driving. I would choose the book over the CD because you can pick it up at any time to seek a particular prayer. This book would be a great gift for a Christian Bride
4,Great Read!,This book is a great read whether your marriage is great or in trouble. I recommend it to anyone who wants to improve.
5,Eyeopening!,"This book is sooo convicting! I had no idea that when I started to earnestly pray for my husband, God would show me all the areas where I was harboring resentment, anger, fear, etc. What an eyeopener! I am keeping a journal day by day as I work through the book and the issues that arise. It's funny to discover some areas that are really hard to get through (sometimes requiring praying and re-reading several times) and the ones that are a breeze (and worthy of praise!) I really wish I'd read this book during my first marriage. Many of the issues with my current husband are similar, and I realize they begin with me. I am so thankful to finally see the light!"
5,Anointed and Powerfully lead by the Holy Spirit(Transforming,"Stormie, I thank you for be so humble before the Lord,to share your experiences and transformation with us. I pray Blessings upon you and your family,for you have been a major Blessing to my life and many others out there. My eyes was fully opened to what needed transformed in my life, to be what God has created me to be! And to allow Peace and Joy and Love back into my families life and to repair a falling marriage.If the willingness does not start somewhere for change you may never know what God has created you to be.Change starting in you does not make you right or wrong it makes you what God has created you to be and allows him to work through you.And I promise that your eyes will be opened and transformation will happen when you read ""The Power of a Praying Wife"" When you read see through the eyes of the Spirit and listen through the ears of the Spirit."
5,Testimonies of women all over the world are the same!,"I have bought this book for so many of my friends and relatives. When I read parts of this book, it reminded me of how Great God is! What God does for one He will do for someone else. HALLELUJAH TO THE MOST HIGH GOD!! THANK YOU JESUS!!"
3,Useful for women in struggling marriages,"My marriage is relatively strong and healthy, but I bought this book because I had heard good things about it. I ended up not finishing it because many of the prayers and struggles didn't relate to my own life. One thing I did appreciate, though, in the introduction, was Stormie's emphasis on our need as Christian wives to deal with our own heart attitudes toward our husbands.I'd recommend the book particularly to women who have non-Christian husbands or who are in difficult marriages."
5,Every Wife Should Have One!!,"This is a book that every married woman should have, and every woman who is about to be married. Not only has this helped my marriage(which I have been looking to do for years), but it also helped my relationship with God...whom I had lost touch with long ago.I plan on giving these as gifts to as many people as possible. I also recommend ""The Power of a Praying Woman"" which is just as wonderful, if not more."
5,Highly recommend to EVERY wife and wife to be.,"Can't recommend this book enough. I've been using it for about two years. After the first round, I don't read the introductions any more, I just pray the prayers over and over and over. The first year and a half, God was intensely working on MY heart. Many of the prayers I was praying for my husband, I realized I need them just as much to pray for my self. So I would add: ""Lord, please do this in my heart as well."" Then just a few months ago, as I was going through the prayers again, I started to see the specific prayers God had already begun to answer. I was SO encouraged! Use it if you are struggling in your marriage, in whatever form. God will honor your dedication to pray for your husband, and don't be surprised if God works on your heart before he starts working on your husbands heart. Our hearts need to be transformed just as much or even more :)."
5,Awesome book,This is the best book and I highly recommend it for all wives and women who desire to be married. LOVE IT!!! Will be re-reading and applying to my life.
3,Power of a praying wife,"Have just started to read this but I gave a few of her other books, that I have enjoyed. Hoping that this one is a good one too."
5,This is a book for every wife.,"This book covers every aspect of marriage. It is for every wife who desires a marriage blessed by God and a closer relationship with her husband. It is backed by God's word. God truly uses this author to teach women about their relationships with their husbands. It is an especially effective tool which helps you to summarize your thoughts on different subjects and put them into your prayers. Whatever your concerns may be (health, fatherhood, etc.), Stormie has covered a variety of subjects. You may go into this book thinking about changing your husband, but this book will also change your life in many ways and bring you closer to God. God Bless You, Stormie Omartian."
5,Excellent!,"The book was a gift to me from a dear friend. My husband and I have always had a solid foundation just several issues of miscommunications and so on. I began reading the book and our lives are changing and we both or transforming into the couple that God wants us to be, we are so much happier now and our lives together are becoming better than I've ever imagined possible. This book is a must for all couples, it teaches you how to pray for your husband as well as yourself or anyone that is in need. My friends are all getting it for Christmas!"
5,AWESOME!,This book helped me know how to pray for myself and my husband in a deeper way. I would highly recommend it to all wives who want to pray more effectively.
5,amazingi love,"I love this book and I read it over and over. When I find struggles with my marriage, I read this book as a reminder. Highly recommended."
5,My heart overflowed reading this. Just what I need!!!,"What a book!! The prayers of this lady melted my old hard heart! I would read and read her prayers over and over! How does this woman know MY desires? She, through the leading of the Holy Spirit, understands the needs of husbands and wives. It is so evident how much the marriage as well as the husband, depends upon the praying wife. She saw miraclous changes in her marriage,through the power of prayers, and as she states, she is no more special to God than I am, and I can have the same kind of marriage, which is my heart's desire! God Bless Stormie Omartain for putting her heart to words and being open enough to share her experiences with us! I will read and re-read this book many times. I bought a copy for my three married daughters and some other friends."
5,We Have Power!,"I was truly blessed by this book. Stormie Omartian really brought this message in a way that any woman, of any walk of life would be able to embrace. This book was recommended to me by a friend. I am so grateful that I bought it. I have given it to family members.This book talks about alot of the aspects of your husbands life. From his sex life to his relationship with the Lord. It is awesome the effect we have on our husbands life just by praying for him in a specific way. I am sure if you are like me, you pray for your spouse anyway, but Stormie really helps you put things into perspective. She even gives you prayers at the end of each chapter to help you.IF YOU ARE MARRIED OR ENGAGED, PLEASE PICK UP THIS BOOK YOU WILL REFER TO IT TIME AND AGAIN EVEN AFTER YOU HAVE READ IT.BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD!"
5,Great Starter Book to Pray for Husband,This book was helpful in helping to teach me how to pray for my husband on a daily basis. The author pretty much covers every aspect of marital life as well as daily life on how wives should pray for their husbands. Good read; fast read.
5,"a ""God-Inspired Awesome Book""","This book is awesome. My husband and I were married in October of 1999. This book has helped me to see the tremendous power in praying for specific key areas of my husband's life. As I read the the first chapter, I realized that I was in need of prayer first. I read the chapters and pray the prayers everyday; and I plan to continue for the rest of our married lives. The words of the prayers are powerful and exact. I feel spiritual power just from saying the prayers. I thank God for blessing me with a wonderful husband and I know that God is going to continue blessing our marriage because of what I am implementing from this book. I recently shared some of the prayers with my husband and he was blessed. He was amazed to know that I am praying such in-depth prayers for him daily. The prayers really ministered to his heart."
5,A Blessing to Our Marriage,This book has been such a blessing to me and my marriage. I recommend it to all my married friends and I refer to it all the time. The introduction and the first chapter alone are worth it. The power of prayer is awesome.
2,Not something I can recommend.,"My church did a series on the book ""His Needs, Her Needs"". After years of counseling married couples the author discovered that men honestly believe sex is one of a man's basic needs. The bible in I Cor. 7:5 says not to ""deprive each other"" except by mutual consent for a time"" so that Satan will not tempt you for your lack of self control. If your husband desires sex, as his only source for the rest of his life you should not scorn the idea that it is something he ""needs"" from you. As for the part about not praying together with your spouse, since the two of you are one flesh you have more prayer power together than apart. That said I don't think this book is for me, since I am a newlywed and haven't hit the point of any of the problems in this book. Also, if I had reached the point where a spouse was physically abusive or using drugs I can't ever say I would condone staying with that kind of man. I dated a man like that and I can only say ""Run. Run like hell."""
5,A MUST READ!!!,"I read this book, and no matter what you are going through in your marriage this book is an extremely helpful tool. If you are newly married, married 25 years, separated, at the brink of divorce this book can help you turn things around and get back on track. The book helps by allowing you to realize your role, what to accept, and not to accept. It reveals what you need to change in yourself through prayer. I found this book extremely helpful, and an excellent referral source. I have gone back and read it at least three times. I have also been able to help others with the knowledge I have gained from it.Thankful"
5,Best Book My Wife Has Read in A Long Time,"I have had The Power of a Praying Husband since last year, So i decided to buy my wife The Power of a Praying wife, I am amazed at how fast this books works, We pray more as a couple, argue less, She knows when to let go and i certainly knows when to take the lead more, bottom line, our relationship has improved tremendously. we refer to this book for simple instructions, of course we have a long way to go as our marriage is in its 8th month, and Life is so good with these books. Thnaks Stormie Omartian"
5,Great Book,The book is really good and I have enjoyed reading it. I read it daily and it has helped me see another way of looking at things in life.
5,A must have for ALL married women.,"Wow!This book is amazing. Believe me, it'll make you look at yourself and see how good of a wife you really are!! This book will help you become calmer, more loving and eventually a regal wife that carries a wonderful spririt in her home. Prayer is the answer, it really is.Stormie goes right to the scriptures to prove it. That's what I love the most about this book - the direct reference to the Word and a guideline to know how to pray better. It doesn't matter where you are in your marriage. Even if you have a wonderful and healthy marriage - you'll learn God's definition of wonderful and healthy - not your own. Guaranteed your relationship with your husband will be nurtured by this powerful and well written book. I thought I would pass it around when I was done - but i can't let go as it has become a continuous reference for me. This book is outstanding."
5,Terrific and life-changing!,"This book will change you and your marriage. It changes your perspective and attitude. A must for anyone in a difficult marriage, struggling relationship or even to strengthen a good marriage! I bought two for my step-sisters."
4,Excellent Book,"This book is a great guide for the Christian wife. I found that I often refer to it, even though I've read it twice. Whenever there is a moment where my marriage needs prayer, I can simply turn to the index/TOC and find the relevant prayer to get my marriage back on track. Excellent book and a must read for all wives."
2,Preaching from a Pedestal,"I am a Christian wife and I found this book sorely lacking. The author of this book wrote from the perspective of one who has seen little or no difficulty in her life and yet, I believe that the average person encounters many more hardships than were presented in the book. I do not know Stormie and she certainly revealed very little about herself through this book. To me, she seemed to be speaking from a very high platform, preaching what a ""good"" Christian should preach, with no real prayer-conquered marriage difficulties to stand on. If your marrriage already has very few, minor problems, perhaps this book would tone your relationship. However, if you live in the real world, where there are hardships constantly around the bend, I'd avoid this book and just stick with the good old Bible. Her words seemed far from heart-felt and down-to-earth."
1,For divorcing women only,"As a new Christian bride, I was excited to begin a strong foundation in my marriage through God's word. I began reading this book and was discouraged that it was only applicable to women who are unhappy in their marriage and having serious problems. Once I got to the section entitled, ""I don't even like him, how can I pray for him"", I decided that this book was only applicable to women with serious marriage problems."
1,Good Book for women to stay abused!!!!,"Thanks to this backward book that teaches women to not stand up for themselves and let a man verbally abuse them is the reason women will stay in bad marriages and teach their kids its ok to accept poor behavior. Its the life they were taught to live.I believe God wants children in safe positive healthy environments. A wife can pray and be a strong single parent without taking insults from an abusive or addictive husband bringing everyone down. Pray and care for yourself and your children and provide a safe happy home. Pray for the husband and pray he will seek therapy and learn to respect women.Stormie get a clue, women are not on this earth to cater to men and their every whim!I hope Stormie will one day donate her book profits to a women's shelter and pray for them, they have some very sad stories to tell!"
3,Well written from experience,"I did not give this book the highest ratings, though it was written well from Stormy's point of view. Her years as an angry wife behind her, this authr writes as one who has endured and won the endearing love of her husband and life is smooth now. She talks about her tears and personnal life and hardships. Her advice is, of course, to hang in there. I only disagreed with her sexual advice to all woman to say YES, no matter how they are feeling or what is going on. Describing the male need and to totally overlooking the woman. This is old world thinking and I would only say that honesty should prevail in a Christian home. Other things I may disagree with, but at least this author speaks from her heart and her ideas seemed to work for her. Many serious depressions can result from Stormy's prescription, but who can tell which is the best course. I believe prayer and the Spirits guidance can still lead .. and prayer is the Rx."
5,Great Book full of wisdom,"My sister-in-law told me about this book when my marriage hit a rock bottom....Unfortunatley after almost 2 years of praying, my marriage ended in divorce...Maybe it will help with my next marriage God willing...I do BELIEVE God CAN work miracles, but it wasn't meant to be for me.."
5,The Power of A Praying Wife,"I bought this book as a gift. I already owned it and have bought several for friends and family. I highly recommend this book, it definitely changed my life. One of the very few nonfiction books I have read, I can't get into them."
5,The Power of a Praying Wife,I did not realize I had ordered the Deluxe edition and I was pleased with this selection. Purchased for a friend - I seemed to be in brand new condition.
5,praying wife,"this book gets right to point. the chapters are very short and easy to get through. the most powerful part of Stormie Omartian's writing is her use of scripture. I have been compelled to spend time praying for my husband in so many more areas of his life so that he is surrounded by God's Spirit, directing and guiding him in all he does."
5,An excellent book if you desire a life-long marriage,"I have been praying from this book for about three weeks, and already I have seen my good marriage become stronger. I received my book as a gift, and have already given two away as gifts, and plan to give several more copies to friends. I highly recommend this book."
4,Good focus -easy to read,"This is a good book with short chapters that are easy to read and apply. It helps you to focus of praying for your husband in every aspect of his life such as his mind, reputation, safety, health, etc. It has definitely stretched me and help me pray specifically for aspects of my husband's life that I never prayer for in the past. We are using this in a women's small group Bible study in conjunction with the workbook (but not using the videos)."
4,"Powerful book, Powerful Prayer","I got this book thinking it would help my marriage, make me feel like a better wife. In reality, it helped me to focus on me, what I needed and what I needed to turn over to God, what I needed to change in me, and once I did that, the changes I saw in my family life, things I had prayed for for years, were suddenly happening when i changed me.It was a wonderful book, and I have read it through a number of times. I do the prayers for a month, then I wil lgo back a month or two later and start it again, espically when I feel that I am not ""doing it right"". i have also went back over specific chapets and prayed them over and over abotu certain areas that were important.It is great. I recommend it for every wife!"
4,The Power of a Praying Wife,"I like this book, she hits problems right on the mark and the prayers are good as well."
5,Tool for a Successful Marriage,"Stormie has used her gifts to help many women tap into the power of prayer. Through sharing her own personal challenges,victories and praying God's Word, Stormie gives wives the ultimate tool for a successful marriage. This book is a must have for wives and any woman who desires to live out God's design for marriage. This book will bless you. The Power is Real!"
5,Insightful help & hope for any marriage,I picked this book up just a week before my husband moved out after just 3 years of marriage. This book is still giving me encouragement & prayer sources. I highly recommend this book for women of all ages - no matter how good or how bad you think your marriage is.
5,Excellent seller,"I ordered a book from this seller last April and contacted the customer service regarding my questions. I will say this seller is one of the best who care really her customers. I appreciate her business attitude, and if possible, I will order books from this seller again."
2,For Struggling traditional conservative marriages,"I committed to praying through this book. The Holy Spirit has used it in some ways to speak to me. But, mostly I find it advocating a type of marriage that I do not see in scripture. This book is geared to marriages that place wives as the submissive server in the family not the equal helpmate. This book is based on an extremely conservative traditional view of marriage. Also, this book is geared towards people who are harboring anger and resentment toward their spouse. I was looking and hoping for a book that would be able to be used in a marriage full of love and vibrancy. This is not that book. BUT, I do think at times she brings up good points and did feel like parts of it spoke to me. This book is best for a conservative submissive wife struggling to love her husband."
2,Why the hype?,"I purchased this book BECAUSE of all the excitement and was quite disappointed. The Power of a Praying Wife is (at its best) a mediocre attempt at explaining the importance of praying for our husbands. Most of the time, Omartian sounds trite and superficial."
5,Awesome!,"I am LOVING this book & study guide! Every woman should read this... even if she is currently single and has a ""future"" Husband :) Our group of girls from our church lifegroup is doing this as our bi-weekly Bible study... powerful stuff!"
4,A Wife's Battle Plan,"Too often we neglect the most important person in our life in our prayer times - our husband. Stormie Omartian gives us a powerful tool to use daily to be a soldier for our husband. Each prayer allows us to protect our husbands, to nurture our husbands and to love our husbands as christian wives should. It's a battle armor we cannot afford to miss out on."
5,Power of the Praying Wife,"This book helped me so much! I have developed greater patience with my husband, and a closer relationship with God through prayer. Everytime I pray for him, whatever I pray for happens! I HIGHLY recommend this book for any wife who is not sure exactly what her role in the marriage is according to God, and who really wants to be a ""helper"" to her husband. I plan on getting their other books also --- ""Power of a Praying Parent"" and the study guide for ""Power of a Praying Wife""."
2,A Big Disappointment,"As an avid reader of Civil War history and historical novels, I was very disappointed in this book. The characters never developed so that I could care for them. The story was also peppered with annoying little historical inaccuracies. While starting off well, the story quickly collapsed. It seemed as if the author didn't quite know who he wanted the main characters to be. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,Unrealistic and poorly researched,"I don't know who E. Randall Floyd is, but this book was very poor when compared with others in its field. He had many historical facts wrong. I recommend the author do his research before writing another."
2,"Oh, my God -- Just put it down","Floyd had real, original Civil War letters to work from in writing this book, and it is my firm belief that the author of said letters should come back from the dead and run Floyd through with a bayonet, or at least give him lice or something. The parts of the book -- mostly battle scenes -- that appear to have been taken from original documents are fairly good, but Floyd has failed to flesh them out, so that what we end up with is a disjointed, scattered account that lacks dramatic tension. The reader gets to the end of the book and thinks ""wait... did I just read something?"". The plot line concerning Wiley's wife waiting at home was treacly. And, as if that wasn't enough, the book is full of small but annoying errors: a piece of jewelry inscribed *19*-something for the year; the Orange Plank Road as ""a dirt path"". Overall, I'd say don't bother."
1,Very disappointed,"I heard this author interviewed on Georgia Public Radio and was excited to hear about the book, because my great-great grandfather was in the same Company A of Georgia's 49th Regiment as was the book's main character. What a let-down. I have never been so disappointed in a book. I thought it was very poorly written. Amateurish even. I could not even finish the book, because I was so disappointed at how poorly it was done. There was no sense of setting or characterization, or feeling for the characters. They felt like cardboard cut-outs. ""Cold Mountain,"" this ain't."
2,"Despite the title, a rather shallow story.","After reading The Black Flower, this book definitely ended up being a disappointment. The characters don't have much much depth, and the book may contain some historical inacuracy. Two Georgia teenagers are discussing the fame of ""General"" Sheridan during the summer of 1862. Colonel Sheridan's promotion to brigadier general did not happen until September 13, 1862 (although it was then effective back to July 1, 1862). Maybe the kids were psychic? There is also a reference to an inscription on a silver cross belonging to a dead child that is dated 1948. Back to the future once again. Seems to me this book was rushed to press to capitalize on the success of books like Cold Mountain. At $24.95 for a paperback, the price is too steep for the contents. Is it a good book? Maybe. Is it a great book? No way. Save your money and check it out of the library."
5,Another CD to LOVE,"Mr. Munsch is ""the man"" we all listen to on a daily basis. I purchased this CD to go along with the Love You Forever one and my boys' love it just as much! Great gift for all ages!"
2,GET THE OTHER VERSION,"Unless you need to save a few bucks, get the Image Entertainment version. I purchased this version and was acutually suprised by the plot and acting, it's pretty good. The picture and sound quality are terrible. The images seem bleached and washed out. Many of the opening credits are not discernable."
3,"3 stars for the movie, but it is available elsewhere","I want to mention that while the movie is entertaining, it is available (without the extras, of course) on theHorror 250 Movie Pack. While that pack is a bit more expensive, you're getting another 249 movies! Also, in the extras on this DVD edition, the photo shoot of women staging deaths for paperback covers is lifted directly fromMondo Cane 2, which is really worth a buy if you're at all a fan of exploitation or shockumentaries.Three stars for the film, which is entertaining and goofy, but this edition might not be the one to buy."
1,Fast forward review,"Oh boy, we're really dating the old ffr here, but I actually saw this in a drive-in theatre, it had some other name. OK, there's some plot about a movie being made in a castle and some dude gets possessed or something like that, dresses up in red leotards and goes about getting all the actresses in his torture chamber where he stumbles from girl to girl in these silly stylized demented hunchback-style movements, oh man.So anyway, we're interested in sex sleaze scenes, not historical horror movies, and there are a couple, to be fair. The best is in the final torture chamber scene, where we got (a) a hanging babe with hot tar poured on her back, (b) two spinning babes whose bras are threatened by adjustable blades and (c) a face-down reclining babe riding an oven. Zero nudity, all naughty bits carefully hidden. I don't know, one star for nostalgia?"
5,Hip HOT Pop Shot Hits tha Spot,"One of my favorite CD's, an elegant blend of pop and eclectic edge keep it funky. The lyrics are beguiling, on the surface simple, but full of meaning on mulitple levels. Solid line up of songs! Looking forward to the next CD from this artist."
2,To be valued as history rather than entertainment,"Captain Video was one fo the first (1949) television hits. It had a zero budget (they filmed next to a department store and borrowed props minutes before televising, the scripts were nonsense and nearly incoherent, the uniforms were army surplus, 15 minutes of live action were followed by a grade ""D"" movie serial that had nothing to do with Captain Video, etc.) but it was popular with those who were enjoying the novelty of their new television sets. These are the only remaining kinescopes of this series (The Dumont Network junked everything in their warehouses). To see how crude early television was, see this but don't expect to be entertained."
4,Lyrics that cut to the core,"Tiffany Arbuckle Lee's voice is what first caught my ear--sounding like Evanescence's Amy Lee, but I purchased this album because I was genuinely touch by the lyrics, and the emotional power in Lee's voice as she sings Cut. No less powerful are the songs Jekyll and Hyde, Manic, Better, and Damaged.There are a couple of songs on this album that are too pop for my taste, but not pop enough to keep me from listening to this album over and over again."
4,Plumb - Chaotic Resolve,This is personally my favorite Plumb album. The lyrics are creative and the vocals are brilliant. One of the best female voices out there. I highly recommend this CD!
5,Justin's review,If you are interested in listening to a powerful album you should check out Chaotic Resolve by Plumb. She is one of my favorite Christian female artists.
5,Chaotic Resolve,"I have to say, I was very impressed during the first listen of Plumb's new offering! It sounds to me like she's back to her Candy Coated Waterdrop days, but with more edge. I'm a traditional metal/hard rock listener, so honestly, I don't listen to too many ""Christian"" artist. Plumb is the exception for me though, because she truly does her thing and does it well!Tiffany seems to put more elements into her music using traditional instruments, but adding strings, piano, etc. This gives her music more than just the basic cookie cutter, one dimensional sound. I commend her for staying true to her sound and for what she does. It seems to me that there are alot of us that respect her for that."
3,Not as good as past albums,"Don't get me wrong; I am a huge fan. I adore Plumb and her amazingly unique voice and style. This was the first album put out by her that I was even disappointed in. While there are a few very nice songs, some which resemble her original cds (Cut, Better, Jekyll and Hyde, Manic, Bittersweet) the rest of the songs have started to resemble pop/dance music(Blush, Real Life Fairytale, and especially Motion), which really disappointed me.Also, this album put so much more emphasis on Christianity than her other albums which really limits her audience.It is worth buying for some of the songs, but it is not one of those cds that blow you away."
5,My Favorite Album of Plumb,"Chaotic Resolve surpasses CandyCoated. I find the tracks in the album are songs which everyone can relate to. It's the best one yet by Plumb...I like it better than any of their albums... well done, Tiffany!"
5,"Great musicianship, beautiful voice","Kate Price's second album Deep Heart's Core is one of the best CD I've purchased ever. She has an innovative style, with beautiful rhythms and great musicianship. Besides her enchanting voice made a joyous listening to this album. The only problem I've got is that this album was released in 1995 (4 years ago!). Who knows if she is in the music biz yet or not anymore?"
3,The jury is still out...,"Great concept. I liked removing the bread box from my counter and utilizing a drawer that was just holding plastic bags. Installation, though no instructions accompanied the item, is not too difficult to figure out. But the jury is still out on the effectiveness. I think I am noticing that bread, particularly sliced bread, is getting moldy quickly, maybe more quickly than when I stored it in my counter bread box."
5,Very nice,"These are great and the packaging is very nice and professional. To administer the needles, it comes with a handy applicator that keeps the needles very sanitary."
5,A must for Solitary Pagans!,I say Pagans because the book deals with numerous different traditions and denominations. It is a wonderful resource for any Solitary looking to creating her/his own rituals and lore. Each Sabbat is thoroughly described in it's own chapter.
2,not much there,"i don't think this is a _bad_ book, it's just that there's not much there. it may be helpful for beginners, but i got it looking more involved activities and information related to the holidays and it just wasn't there. in particular, i found the crafts and activities simplistic- again, nothing wrong with them but if you can go through the holidays naming them, saying a few words about when they occur and what they mean and listing a few activities and other things associated with each, it is my opinion that you won't get much from this book. i bought it and gave it away."
4,A good book of holiday fun,"Length:: 1:38 MinsThis is a good holiday book, but some of the information could be wrong. Just some of the recipes and activities seemed to not really fit with the holidays they were listed under. Other than that, it is a great book for ideas, recipes, and activities to do for each of the holidays. It does contain historical information about how each holiday came about, it's significance, if it's being celebrated today and more. It reads really nice like a regular book or manual. I'd recommend as a resource book for anyone from beginner to master."
1,Poor Quality,This looks nice in red and is large. However after a couple of months it is peeling apart. Would not recommend this product.
2,"Exactly what I paid for, unfortunately.","It's a mousepad, and so you have to understand that certain expectations of aesthetic pleasingness will be left at the door. It is also a sub-five dollar mousepad. And so a certain quality is also left outside, beyond the wooden portal.That being said, I still do not like this mousepad. It has near to no weight behind it (making it liable to shifts in position with even a small gust of wind from a nearby fan), the texture is unpleasantly rough and cheap feeling, and the red color is not even close to vibrant as I had hoped but rather is dull and depressing. It has the feeling of a wet suit that has been left out in the sun for several days.I spend a large amount of time with my mousepad, and I will be purchasing one of this particular variety's more expensive cousins to replace it."
3,Red peals like crazy,I have had this for a few weeks now and the red is peeling... Sigh. You get what you pay for.
5,Great travel shoes,"I bought these shoes (black) just 2 weeks before a trip to Italy, desperate for a comfortable decent-looking walking shoe. I had purchased a pair of Mephistos (3 times the price of this shoe!) several years ago for a trip and have never been able to wear them without getting blisters at the heel.These shoes were so comfortable, I never got one blister wearomg these shoes 12 hours a day for 12 days, and my feet did not get hot in them, either. Merrell shoes are the best I've tried, and I've tried a lot of them. While they are not high-fashion in their design, they are certainly an acceptable shoe to wear with nice slacks."
4,Holy Bible: The Word of God Alive and Active NRSV with Apocrypha,"I thoroughly enjoy the purchased book, although the version is slightly different than the one I was seeking. However the ease and the receiving of the book was the best."
1,Wrong product name,"I didn't buy one of these, but anyone who does any work with insulated wire can tell you that this is a standard wire stripper. It's a great tool, but NOT for anything having to do with standard RG6 or RG59 video cable or their connectors."
3,Not recommended for beginners,"I would not recommend this Tarot deck for beginners as it makes it difficult to understand the correlation to other more ""common"" Tarot decks such as Rider-Waite."
2,Omelet pan review,"Precise Heat 8-Inch Element Omelet PanWas disappointed in the pan because the handle was broken off when it arrive. It was shipped during a very cold time of year, so I speculate cold did not help, but they need to improve the product."
5,Cycling equipment has definitively improve over the last decade,"Hi. Elite trainers' Fluid technology is amazing, specially for someone buying a new trainer 10 years after purchasing his first one. I'll stick with this one despite the appeareance of the new Elite Cronos line which promises further improvements.SincerelyRodrigo"
5,"as I recall, I say, as I recall","Funny to watch a northerner playing a southern gentleman and a truly original character. Sorry to find out what Warner Bros did to him after they developed Foghorn Leghorn cartoon character. Obviously Kenny Delmar was no, I say, no Groucho Marx to put those carpetbaggers in their place. His character will live on with the South even though he was no southern planter, that is."
1,Don't Buy the Full-Price Title!,This is a terrific CD but don't buy the full-price version of this title. The exact same performances have been recently reissued at a mid-line price in EMI's Great Recordings of the Century series (see my review). Same great music at a much lower price! Don't make the same mistake I did!
4,Good New Age music,Love his style. Unique ! The whole cd is good and worth purchasing. I bought the the cd for the first song - overture which is still my favorite
1,Christians should have two-sided views.,Anybody who read this book and wants an honest opinion should see the debate between Dr. William Campbell and Dr. Zakir Naik. The Christians will be shocked to see how miserably Dr. Campbell lost the debate. They will also learn that there are thousands of serious errors in the bible which is supposedly from God. It is a great shame that the Christians are motivated by hatred and deception. That video is available at islamicbookstore.com in the video section and then follow the Debates and Speeches of Dr. Zakir Naik link.
4,SIMPLE & FUN!!!,"This is not a cheap wallet mart YoYo. I have always been a fan of simple toys and have enjoyed playing with the Yomega. It will provide any kid hours of fun. I would suggest this to anyone that has kids that are spending too much time on video games. I found this to be true after my daughter plays video games for hours and this is a great method of exercise and skill. While it will not compete with action games it does provide simple fun.It is well made and has lasted over four months thus far. This is much better than a five dollar novelty YoYo that I purchased at the big walletmart store. It is priced very well thru Amazon and if you or your child needs a break from online or video type games, I found this to do the trick. I do like the lights and while it is not in the league of professional YoYo's, it will entertain people of all ages."
4,Could sleep longer - but still works very well,"Good weight, light display is awesome and the stock cord that this YoYo ships with is sturdy. Could sleep longer, but does the job for the majority of my tricks. Bottom line: solid, well constructed YoYo with a great light display. Suitable for the novice and the advanced user!"
4,"Love it, but one side is blinking out..... :-(","This is an awesome yo-yo, and I totally love it. You read the reviews, calling it the 'cadillac' of yo-yo's. It's true and you really feel like you've got a piece of quality in your hands.That said, I haven't used it very much (probably 90 minutes total, max) since I got it and already one of the sides is dying off. I will have to pop the side open and replace the battery. Wish it had lasted longer.But I'd actually buy one again... it's that cool."
5,Definitely Lights Up!,Length:: 1:08 MinsDefinitely a cool and reliable light-up yo-yo - it also comes with a trick DVD that you can watch to learn how to do more tricks as well!
4,Impressive yo-yo,"While I'm not an avid yo-yo person, I can execute the ""around the world"" and ""walk the dog"" tricks competently, so those are the ones I first attempted. The action of the yo-yo on the string was quite smooth, with no twisting, thus the yo-yo moved up and down without spinning out of control (i.e. in the horizontal fashion common to cheaper yo-yos, where the string rubs on a yo-yo edge). Another feature of the yo-yo is the multi-colored strobe effect. The lights flash when the yo-yo leaves your hand and keep flashing until the yo-yo is back in your palm. In addition, the yo-yo comes with Brain Lube, a lubricant, so that the yo-yo's out-of-the-package performance can be maintained. And that's not all! There's also an extra string AND a DVD of tips and tricks. Pretty good bang for the buck. If you want a quality yo-yo, this one fits the bill."
5,Excellent Book for people with Crohn's,"I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's Disease. This means that my diet has had to change dramatically. This book is filled with reciepes I can digest easily, but more than that ones that I have thoroughly enjoyed."
4,Grain Free Gourmet,i bought this book to get more recipes for my adult daughterwho has crohn's.the recipes turned out to be more gourmet than just legal for theSCD diet she is on (which is a life saver). the book gives her recipes she can serve to others as a special treat.the tacos are the best!
5,GREAT Product,"This is such a great book! I have a gluten allergy and the variety of recipes here is astounding - much more than just eggs or a muffin made from 5 different kinds of flour and potato starches, etc.Thanks!"
2,Disappointing Choice,"When searching Amazon for a grain free cookbook, I came across the Grain-Free Gourmet cookbook by Jodi Bager and Jenny Lass. In looking through the cookbook, I was disappointed as the book is far from gourmet material and more of a high school introduction to cooking basics. The first 33 pages contain an introduction and very basic cooking facts along with how to store food in the fridge. In keeping with the nutritional component of the cookbook, honey is used in the majority of the published recipes. As someone who rarely uses any kind of sweetener in cooking, I found the use of honey to be a bit too much ex: honey in tomato sauce. From an artistic perspective, The cookbook itself is lovely. The photography is nice, and the pages are constructed in a visually appealing way. However, the recipes are quite boring and I feel that it was a waste of money."
4,classic rock/psych album.,"there's some good psychedelic songs on here and some good rock and maybe one strange song,but it's agood cd to have in your collection ,if you like music from the late '60's -early '70's era!"
5,A wild ride!,"Tessa Jones' first novel is an excellent work that takes a horrific reality, blends it with plausible science fantasy, and produced a riveting book. The reader is along for a wild ride as she delves into the deepest pit of human behavior and emerges on the other side. Unexpected twists and turns keep the reader guessing right up to the finish. This is a book that teaches about a little understood disorder, exposes a rarely discussed taboo, and keeps the reader hooked right to the end. Bravo!"
5,Excellent Read,I read the book in a matter of a few hours. I couldn't put it down. It kept me interested to the very end. Very well written book.
4,Excellent jazzy pop/disco/funk,"This is a nice album from a woman with a fantastic voice. Sophie's voice is reminiscent of N'Dea Davenport in the early Brand New Heavies days in that it has a refreshing directness about it without all the R&B; flutterings that I'm used to hearing. Standout tracks include ""Back Together"" and ""Over Again"", two disco-infused jazz pop tunes that are incredibly catchy; you can't help but sing out loud. ""27 C"" shows a bit of experimentation with some Latin flavor and is a great showcase for Sophie's smooth and delicate vocals. ""Fly"" is a straight jazz pop tune that is nevertheless soothing and pleasant.Overall this is a worthwhile first effort for a promising singer, let's hear some more!"
1,It last only a week,I did use this crap for only one week and the digital display stop working.Lucky me that I have another micrometer.
3,"good dvd/show, but very short","First off - I love Steve Winwood, especially his stuff with Traffic and his newest album - Nine Lives. So I really enjoyed most of the songs on this DVD. The picture quality is obviously 1080p. DTS sound is available and is superb. However, this is a very short set. I can't believe they put out a DVD that's only about as long as a 45 minutes long. I probably wouldn't have paid as much if I would've known this.Track listing: Can't find my way Home, Empty Pages, Bully, Glad, Freedom Rider, Back in the High Life (ugh), Dear Mr. Fantasy, and Why Can't we Live Together. All very short versions, to the point, with very little jamming."
5,Steve Winwood: Live in Concert (Blu-Ray),"Wow, just wow!!! This is excellent. Five skilled musicians at the peak of the game and enjoying themselves. Lots of attention to acoustics and the stage is beautiful. Audio is crystal clear and well mixed. Solid camera work. I highly recommend!"
5,A splendid performance,"This is the same concert released in DVD format around 2006, no new tunes, no extra material, no interviews, no bonuses. Now, there may not be much difference in sound quality between DVD and BR, you'd need either to be quite young, to (still) have very good hearing or own a super Hi-Fi set to notice any significant improvement. But the full HD video makes the whole difference. Be aware though, there's no cheap way to remove all the imperfections of the master video tape and surely this transfer didn't attempt to do it. The picture is extremely grainy in many parts and throughout the concert you get different color temperatures coming from the stage lights (from bluish at the beginning to red-orange near the end). But this is an old show so what would you expect. I already had the DVD and now I bought the BR disc happily. This is one of my favorites taped performances and I'm glad they finally put it out on Blu Ray."
3,Leaky bottles,While I am very happy with the product itself when I received it the bottles were leaking. It is simply bad packaging on the part of the manufacurer. There were no separators to hold the bottles in place in the carton and as a result some of the torque on the caps backed off and caused leakage in the original carton not the one amazon had packed it in.
4,An Old Classic on the Colorado Plateau,"Crampton has long been revered by Colorado Plateau fans for this hardbound classic, with its many black and white photos of key spots all over the area, and its old technicolored full-page shots of special scenes. Crampton knows his stuff, both inhistory and in having put his boots on the ground he writes about. There's a glossy color reprint of Standing Up Country that's been issued, but it still can't compete with this early edition, dated as some of the info might be."
1,Do NOT Use This Stuff,Do not use this product on Anti-glare screens. I am looking right now at a NEC monitor here at work that was just fine until I cleaned it with this stuff last week. Now I have patches of the anti-glare coating missing.
2,Kinda worked,"This screen cleaner did clean the monitor of stuck on matter with ease, but it left an after haze that despite much rubbing with a soft cloth would not remove, and the resulting fibers from the soft cloth we as annoying as the dirt I had intentionally washed off"
2,It's kind of Boring,"I ordered Vol. 1 & 2, I only liked Vol.1 because it has more singing than talking and that caught my 17month old attention. And I think that's what most parent's want, something that will keep their kids entertained, not bored with talking."
2,Your kid will find it boring,"I ordered this because I grew up with it; ""El Show de Topo Gigio"" was very popular in Hispanic markets and as a kid I enjoyed it quite a bit. Adults liked it too, I believe that for a while it was shown as part of the evening fare. So I thought it would be a good idea to buy Volumes 1-4 for my daughter, who's two-and-a-half years old.She hated it.The show begins with Topo Gigio conversing with an older gentleman, sort of the interchange Johnny Carson had with Ed McMann...that goes on for several minutes and gets monotonous quick. Then it switches to Topo Gigio doing some cutesy skits.I've seen my daughter disinterested in some children's videos, this is the first one that actually made her cry. I think it's just too outdated compared to modern fare.If you're a diehard Topo Gigio fan and want this as a collectible or to reminisce, it's fine. But as children's fare, I cannot recommend it."
3,Una edición que puede mejorarse,"El contenido de esta biblia es excelente para aquellos que buscan estudiar con más profundidad las escrituras. Sin embargo, hay que decir que esta edición tiene el problema de que han tratado de reducir el tamaño y cantidad de hojas sacrificando el tamaño de las letras haciéndolas bastante pequeñas y por otra parte las hojas son bastante delgadas, lo cual puede dificultar la lectura sobre todo a aquellas personas con problemas de visión. Algunos mapas presentados pueden no ser suficientemente visibles para este tipo de personas debido al tamaño de los caractéres. Por lo demás, el contenido es excelente"
4,Review of Macarthur Spanish Study Bible,"The Macarthur Study Bible in spanish is great because you get the commentaries of John Macarthur who is a learned man. His insight into many of difficult passages help clear the mind of wrong conceptions. I like the outlines, introductions to each book of the Bible, the topical study on the back of it and also the maps that come with this bible.What i don't like is that there are no words in red to refer to the words of Jesus. I don't like that there is little cross referencing to other parallel passages. The number of the verses are in the middle of the text which makes it difficult to find.I would highly recommend this bible to anyone who would like to get deeper into the Word of God. Since studying from study bibles, i have grown great in the knowledge of Scriptures.Thanks,"
5,A book any horror film fan should be ashamed to be without!!,"I bought this book as a supplement to research on a term paper. Wow, was I surprised!! This is the end-all be-all of horror film books. Mike Mayo is amazingly honest, and though there are some strange entries (The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-up Zombies rates 3 stars), he never becomes defensive. He lists some excellent sources, and as with all Videohound books, cross-indexes everything. Those movies that are not included are not included for good reason. Those movies that are included...well, let's just say this is the ultimate horror book."
4,A must for horror fans!,"Though boasting reviews of only 999 horror films (it's only downfall), this book contains loads of other information, an amazing glossary with cross references and a great design!"
1,Are we looking at the same book?...,"The reviews are terrible, the non-horror choices are ridiculous (Apocalypse Now?, that's the horror of war, not horror), and the cast and director indices leave something to be desired. The author will give a film a great review, then short it in the # of bones rating. I have to recommend trimming off the fat before expanding into another edition."
5,Delightfully readable; very thorough,"I'm not extremely knowledgable about the Middle Ages, much less the scholars that interpreted them, but Cantor's work left me feeling much more informed and eager to read some of the primary sources.Cantor tells the story of the lives of ""the great medievalists of the 20th century"" and shows how their context--historical, cultural, religious, family, academic, etc.--affected their scholarship. (I kept wondering what someone would write about Cantor in a few decades! *grin*) He obviously interacted personally with many of these ""greats.""I'm not sure if I learned more about the Middle Ages or the twentieth century but I know I learned alot about both. In either case, this work is well worth reading."
2,Cantor's Inventions,"When I received this book for Christmas, I was excited. As I read the book, my excitement palled and has become dismay. I find it, though somewhat informative--at least the names of prominent medievalists are given--generally a venomous reflection on those with whom Cantor did not agree. His ascription of venal motives to a number of historians, particularly the Annales school, is not an objective assessment of their contributions to historiography. Were this book billed as a personal polemic, it would be correctly labeled. One may gain some insight into the construction of Medieval history, but if one lacks any prior introduction to the subject, this is NOT the book for them"
1,A waste of time,"Norman Cantor's book, ""Inventing the Middle Ages,"" hardly deserves being classified as non-fiction. The main feature of this work is Cantor's inability to prove any of his assertions. Instead of resting on solid arguments and dealing with the core beliefs of the historians he attempts to critique, he rests upon immature insults and a bizarre, ineffective attempt at providing an historical context to their works. Cantor displays more of his own biases, from his individual center, right wing version of history to his repetitive complaints about the homosexuality of various historians. Cantor's work fails to provide the historical context, the historical tradition or explain the vivid historiography of medieval writings. Above all else, this book is uninteresting, uninformed, and intensely monotonous. I am highly skeptical of the selection process by which Cantor adjudges the who's who of medieval historians."
3,Not a history of the Middle Ages,"It is important to realize that, as the title implies, this is not a history of the Middle Ages; it IS a history of the history of the Middle Ages. That is to say this book is a description of about 20 historians of the twentieth century in Medieval studies, and how they interpreted the Middle Ages of Europe. Despite what the dust jacket comments say, it is certainly not an accessible book for the general public, as a firm understanding of historiographical and interpretive methods and jargon is required as background in order to make sense of this study. I also point out that Cantor is very opinionated!"
5,Everything You Need To Pass,This Study Course is everything you will need to pass the Network+ exam. The study guide is invitingly simple to read and learn from. I had no problems understanding the infomation that was given in the course. When it came time to take the practice tests the software showed me where my mistakes lay and gave me the correct information on the subject. Over all I feel MindWorks study course is the way to go if you are in the market to pass the exam.
2,Poor printing,The dictionary is very heavy compared to the number of words it contains.Very poor quality of ink which still has a strong smell each time i open the book.
1,Stop Jack Naked,The was no content and no point to this documentary/ movie. Stupid indulgence by the director of another movie who thought he could make a movie out of the outtakes of the original. Meaningless Rubbish
3,"Half Excellent, Half Bad Dancers","I was very pleased with the filming because the camera was right in front of the dancers, so you can watch all their movements with precision. I must say, though, that if you decide to buy a Gala DVD, you'd expect to see the best dancers around. Unfortunately that's not what happened. Apparently Yousry or Nourhan allowed certain dancers to perform at the Gala, but I don't have to be professional to conclude that many of these dancers were really bad. If I had to choose, I'd only buy the DVD because of the performances by Virginia , Aireen (the one from Miami), Yasser, and maybe 2 or 3 more. Next time, Yousry and Nourhan must make sure that there are really good dancers at the Gala; otherwise, they should be edited out of the DVD."
3,"Really cute, but really small.","I looked for some kind of measurements, but didn't find any. (I didn't get any answers either. Don't know what happened.) I got it anyway, out of curiosity. It's really really cute, but really really small too: 3.5"" x 2.5""."
2,Not what I expected (not helpful),This is a handle/holder for a utility blade. It doesn't do much when trying to cut through the thick windshield sealant. Don't waste your time with this item.
4,Great starter book,"I have no background in marketing, however, I found this book simple enough to follow while still making intriguing points on each of the 22 laws."
1,Contradictory platitudes that don't teach,"I expected this book to lay out rules of marketing, to help with a marketing department. All that i found was the author's shoehorning their 'laws' into each successful business. For instance: HP, perfect marketers. IBM: poor marketers. Why? HP diversified into the laser jet business when their strength was computers. IBM diversified from the mainframe, which was a mistake. The 'laws' are self-contradictory. There is no way i would know how to make a marketing decision after reading this book. Talk about arm-chair quarterback management."
4,"Great Insights but perhaps out of date now - not quite ""immutable""","This was a great read, and short enough that I never felt anything was too drawn out. I definitely recommend it for anyone interested or involved in marketing, however I will advise to read it with the fact in mind that times have changed. I don't believe all the ""laws"" are immutable. I think the internet age has changed the game. You can refute several of the laws with real-world examples. Google was not at all first in the game of search engines yet now it owns most of that market share. Microsoft deviated from its ""line"" and creates all kinds of software and technology (MS office, Bing, etc) and while not all have been successful, it definitely has achieved success by ""violating the law"" of line extension. Still a great read, just be critical."
3,Whet Your Marketing Appetite,"If you are ""new"" to the subject of business marketing or just want to get back to basics, this book is a great place to start. The authors support their arguments with abundant examples and the book is a quick, easy read. If you want more explanation or detail, you will need to look elsewhere. Anyone who owns or runs a business needs to realize that there are many marketing variables to be considered and this book certainly helps to underscore that point. The 3 most significant ""laws"" to me were the Laws of Perception, Perspective, and Line Extension. Re-read and think about these often."
1,A book that practises what it preaches: perception is all,"The whole book is very seductive. Look at this company, they understood this principle, they were successful. Look at this other company they didn't understand it, they weren't successful. Except that many of his examples have had time to become contradictions of his original claims. It all reminds me of the answer given by the famous communist when asked why the socialist republics failed at the end of the cold war: ""Marxist theory is correct, but the practice was never carried out in full accordance with it, so it is hardly surprising that they all failed"". I'm sure Ries and Trout ought to seriously consider this as an escape route. A better use of their time might be spent looking at the real reasons why so many of the 'predictions' in this book have ultimately proved to be so appallingly inaccurate."
1,"Illogical, Simplistic and Impractical Advice","This collection of anecdotes and contradictory ""laws"" is probably the worst marketing book I have ever read. The only so-called law that Ries and Trout have provided ample evidence to support is the ""law of hype,"" which says that the more a product is hyped the more likely it is to be a dud. The 17 executives in the front of the book who were somehow cajoled into hyping it certainly supports the theory. The only way they could honestly say this was the ""best marketing book"" they ever read was if it was the ONLY marketing book they ever read."
2,It is Okay,The substance of this book would make a great blog post. I am a bit disappointed to have to spend the price of a book for the wisdom a few fortune cookies.
3,An insight into marketing world...,"This book was recommended by my employer to read. I have found a few good points. Having no marketing background, I've found this book helpful. But I wouldn't pay the full price for the book. The book contains actually 132 pages.It has very short chapters, and the book is losing another 22 pages of it on the titles and drawings.This book is okay to read within one sitting or two sittings at the library. Buy it cheap or borrow from the library. This book may become useless if you're not rich, don't have money to invest, or do not make corporate decisions. Read it at your own risk -- some of the info might be of no use."
3,"Once great, now dated and deficient","Like Marketing, times and preferences change. Very little of this book addresses the fast paced changes that have occured.This book is the equivalent to an ancient text from which you can pull some lasting principles but for modern marketing in action you would need to look elsewhere."
3,Recycled Material,"If you haven't yet read anything by Ries and Trout, this could be a five star book. In and of itself, it's a solid book, chock full of uncommon, common sense marketing approaches.If, on the other hand you've read ""Positioning"" or ""Focus"" (Both Superb!) you will have just purchased that which you already have. Reading something by Reis/Trout is an absolute must; they are simply brilliant when it comes to defining, and illustrating, and writing about critical marketing principles.If you've got the time, read ""Positioning"" and ""Focus"". If you'd prefer a Cliffs Notes of those two, ""The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing"" will fit the bill."
3,Helpful but outdated,"The book has useful information and is very straightforward and to the point. But, the examples used are so outdated that it is difficult to determine whether some of the ideas apply in today's technology-driven marketplace. One example states that Microsoft is setting itself up to fail like IBM because it is not concentrating on just operating systems. Anyone knows that not only did Microsoft not turn into IBM, but IBM also has turned things around by changing and expanding product lines. Such examples make it seem like the authors don't know what they're talking about, but I think they do -- it just needs updated info."
4,excellent,"Are you a student of marketing? Then don't miss it... It can be read in one sitting, just like a novel...examples given in the book are practical and excellent"
2,22 Short Chapters of Common Sense,"While an interesting light read, these 'laws' are not immutable. Nor would your business be in peril if you ignored them, as the authors suggest.In general, these laws are only for those obsessed with being number one. People going for those few #1 slots would find this book useless. For everyone else, there are a few small pearls to be gathered, but digging through the muck to find them makes them difficult to spot."
3,"Those who can't do, teach","My belief is that most people who are seriously involved in the Internet business will find this book to be around an even mix of things that are a) useful, b) completely obvious, c) probably only partly correct.I don't regret reading it, but I wouldn't particularly recommend it if you are in the business and, like most people in the business, have limited time."
3,Light and fluffy,"Reading the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing is a lot like eating a Twinkie. It's light and yummy, with no pesky nutrition to slow you down. An enjoyable and easy read, but not much substance. There are some principles presented here that are indeed central to the field of marketing - the Law of the Mind and the Law of Resources to name two. And you wouldn't want to be the marketer who hasn't read Ries and Trout. But this is just a taste of marketing. You'll need to read more to get a full meal."
5,Good Book,I have the audio CD and felt I needed it in a book format for safe keeping of the info. Very informative and I would suggest it to anyone trying to understand marketing.
2,OUTDATED!,"The basic principles in this book may or may not be valid. It's hard to tell, because most of the examples given are no longer valid. So much time is spent on IBM and computers in general, and we all know how much has changed in those areas in the last 8 years. The authors couldn't predict how things would go. They grossly underestimated the popularity of the PC and gave virtually no credit to Microsoft as a company that would be viable in the future. They touted Lotus 1-2-3 and were skeptical that ""office suites"" would ever catch on. (Microsoft Office, anyone?). I think the book is interesting from a historical perspective, but would be dangerous to apply to business today."
5,Don't risk it !!!,"Are you trying to sell an idea or a product or a service to someone. If yes, you need this book. I have been using the laws mentioned in this book and they have transformed the way my business is doing.The book is written with an ""I don't care what you think -- I say it like it is"" attitude. It converts several 'sacred cows' to 'hamburger'. Read it or perish"
2,OUTDATED!!,"The basic principles in this book may or may not be valid. It's hard to tell, because most of the examples given are no longer valid.

4,more than just marketing...,"If you just see this book as a markeing guideline, it is probably not worth buying, but... ... it cites the critical points and makes you thinking. You can even transfer these rules to finance, the stock market,your life. The best chapter is the last one."
4,"""Great Place to start for the beginner"".","This book was fun to read. It is straight to the point, a quick read, easy to follow and written for the novice or expert with lots of meaningful contents, great ideas and examples. It is not a book that will leave you confused, it will leave you with a full understanding of what it takes to be successful in marketing. This book is not going to turn you into a marketing guru over night. ""Marketing situations are subject to a zillion of circumstances"" as Alexander Repiev puts it. This is just a primer on the subject. However, this book's concept is very faddish. It is very contradictory and deceptive as some of the laws depict, but by the time most people realize it they would have already spent their money on the book."
2,Not a very useful book,"Really mediocre guidance, not very detailed and the ideas are really unoriginal. Maybe check it out from the library. Definitely not worth a buy."
5,Surprised,I had expected this book to be dry and dull but I was pleasantly surprised. It has a conversational tone and is perfect for the beginner for a BA thesis. It is written with to do lists and highlight points that make it easy to follow and less intimidating.
5,How To Write A BA Thesis,"The product was delivered promptly an ontime. No writing was on the pages, none of them were tore, bent, or anything. I would buy other products from this person - highly recommended."
1,Meditation Express ???,"This book is not a introduction to meditation. It contains some seperate ideas that could be used to meditate upon, but I found the title ""Meditation Express"" misleading.This is a book for meditating people who like to have some more ideas to meditate upon. I suggest you look in the excerpts of the book, this is all the book contains for the rest of the pages."
5,Paper Plates are'nt just for eating off of,"This book is perfect for your little ones. My 2 1/2 year old daughter loved the crafts we have already done out of the book. I also work with children as my job and also at my church. I highly recommend this book to all you parents, grandparents, Aunt & Uncles, All care givers, and even the expecting parents. A+ Book."
2,Not so great,The instructions in this book are minimal and tiny - all black and white - no color illustrations. The hats are lame. It did not live up to a 5 start rating by any measure.
3,A Little Disappointed,The pattern booklet I received was in rough shape but since is it is 20+ yrs old I won't complain too much. I thought the shipping and handling charges were very expensive as well.
3,Good Selection of Jesuit Prayer,"As someone who is regularly called on to pray before meetings, having a variety of prayer books on my shelf is a great help. ""Hearts on Fire: Praying with the Jesuits"" has been a good addition to my shelves. It includes a variety of prayers from various points in the Jesuits' history, from the great Jesuit saints to more modern members.My only criticism of the book is that many of the selections are more poetical than prayerful. While I acknowledge that poems can be prayers, it is not a form that particularly speaks to me; your mileage may vary."
5,Humility and kindness abound!,"I was looking for this book as I had given my copy away. Luckily, Amazon had it! It is a place that I can 'travel' that offers kindness and hope. Hearts on Fire fulfills me with the strength to stay fully present to others."
5,I.T. for Incredibly Tremendous,"Sure, one can dissect this film the way a film-dissector dissects films. Throw those dissections away, though, and watch this film for the pure beauty of writing, acting, direction, score, cinematography, and genuine zaniness of ecclectica that ensues from the very opening scene til the last. I love this movie for everything that it offers and everything that a film-dissector says it could never offer. To me, it is a cult classic - it cannot be dissected like any other flick.P.S. My favorite scene, other than all of them in general, is when Bernard sees Barbara Darling dance for the first time at the Go-Go club. It's as raw and real as life gets, or at least got at that time. Man alive, this movie gets 6 stars on a 5-star basis."
5,An excelant resource.,"This is a very difficult volume to find as it is rare and out of publication. It is a vast improvement from the first volume""The Scrimshaw Connection"". The photo quality is excellant and many of the photos from the first volume are reintroduced here with better clarity. Both volumes are a must have in your resource library. Both books, in any condition, are an investment as the value continues to increase over time."
4,Great Read,"I really liked this book. It's got detestable hoodlums, likable hired killers, dead housewives, and page after page of sexual tension. And not ""normal"" sexual tension either. What more could you ask for?The writer, John Alvar, is able to take a seriously screwed-up main character, (who has some issues with teenage girls), and make him likable and sympathetic. But at the same time, I kept waiting for the other shoe, or the other dead body, to drop.The action is fast-paced and kept me reading all the way through. I would recommend this to anyone that likes Elmore Leonard or Barry Gifford.I can't wait for the sequel, or better yet, the movie."
2,"Gripping concept, but poor style and development","The premise of the book was strong enough to keep me reading, although I almost gave up on it during a few implausible moments. Coincidences and unlikely occurrences are too frequent throughout the story. It seems strange, for example, that two people who are on the run from unknown killers would accept unsolicited help from a suspicious stranger. Characters occasionally make abrupt decisions that seem to have no basis in reason, but are necessary for the story's progression. Grammatical errors and awkward prose also subtract from the book's impact. Nonetheless, several scenes were effective. If the author's style matures both technically and subjectively, he may be worth looking for in the future."
4,Fun for storytellers,"The illustrations are wonderful. Please know that there are no words in this book. That makes you the storyteller or your child. It's a great way to stoke their imagination when you let them be the ""author""."
1,editor?,"I find it very interesting that a person who manages to edit a work such as this receives as much credit as Mr. Williams does. I am actually dumbfounded and flabbergasted by the amount of errors that actually make reading these 13 essays a struggle. It is hard enough, having to fight to understand all of the profound and complicated non-english words. Williams felt it was better to leave his explanation of these words to the end of the book, so when you finish reading and are completely lost you can only begin to start understanding what the essay writers meant to say. The essays themselves are no more than information presented in a very non-appealing and very text-book like manner. I found it extremely difficult to read through them, nevermind attempting to keep my mind from straying away from the topics. I have never been more dissapointed in a book as I was in this one."
5,More Than Just Weapons,"When I bought this book I was under the impression that it would just cover the individual weapons used by Rangers. The first section goes into detail on the 75th Ranger Regiment and it's history. Individual weapons are covered, including the various M4 configurations. I was pleasantly surprised to see that support weapons and support vehicles (both land and air) are covered as well."
3,I got your HUSKY alright,"I purchased thinking this mat would go well in the rear of my truck for the few times I have riders with the unwanted elements embedded in their shoes. It does work well and high quality except for one thing which really upsets me. That thing is that it is NOT one mat which extends completely across the rear area but TWO mats which BUTT-UP to one another hence a crack in the middle where the water, mud, and or snow can make its way to the carpeting. If you look at the advertising photo it appears it's one mat. Bottom line it is a truck but I won't buy another one like this when these wear out!"
4,Are you ready,"We are actually using this as a bible study. Are you ready to totally submit to your Lord, and truly have a heart ABlaze in his holy spirit.It is very inspiring and challenging, as the flesh wants what it wants and you have the free will to turn away from sin,and can you totally give yourself to God.Chapter 5 bible study tonight. It is an excellent book, that is enhanced by doing it with a group of fellow believers."
5,Bood,"We are using this for a study, and again it is understandable and very easy to apply to our lives. bjh"
5,A Heart Ablaze: Igniting a Passion for God,"What an excellent book. John will challenge you to come up higher in your walk with God. He warns against the dangers of lukewarmness in Christianity; being a Christian is a calling to be holy even as He is holy. This book has helped me to be more conscious of my relationship with the Lord. It has helped me to think more of being a servant for the Lord. When I keep in mind that whatever I do, I do it for the Lord, then my personal happiness in this life is secondary. My Sunday school class has been using this book as our study for the year & I look forward to studying out of more of his books. John is excellent. If you want to have a closer walk with the Lord & live a life of holiness (without holiness, no man shall see the Lord) read all of John's books."
4,Good Book and Reminder of Our Purpose on Earth,"This book was excellent because it reminded me that you must chase after God. That is our purpose: ""Seek ye the kingdom of God and all other things shall be added unto you."" I couldn't put down the book and finished it in 2 days. Today, the church has introduced some doctrines that pulls us away from the purpose of truly being God's servant in terms of helping other Christians and the unsaved. We have become so focused on ourselves and what benefits we could receive from God instead of getting back to the basics. We must as believers redeem the time and make the most of the time God has given us on earth. Time to have God's heart and see things as he sees it."
4,A Heart Ablaze: Igniting a Passion for God,"As usual, John Bevere can show me I'm missing the mark. I thought it was o.k. to go to church, read my bible, and pray. John showed me where the most important time should be spent; in intense prayer with God. Listening to hear His voice, because prayer is a two way conversation. And lately I haven't given God much time to talk,and if I don't I'll never be able to have a stronger relationship with God.John does a great job without beating you over the head with his message.I'd highly recommend it."
4,Hidden tracks,This is a beautiful CD. Nicely textured and very relaxing. The hidden tracks 11-13 are repeats of other tracks on the CD. They are different in length from the first but I could not say what else makes them different.
4,Another fine release,"Again (Chaquico) starts off on the right track, with the wonderfully catchy ""Midnight Swim"". Just the perfect tune to unwind after a hard day at the office."
4,Great new artist!,"I saw a small snippet on CBS Saturday Morning that featured Danielle, and decided to purchase her new CD. What a fantastic surprise! Danielle is a great songwriter and has the support of her band to aid in crafting her songs for her listening audience.A little bit of Melissa Etheridge, Patty Larkin and Jann Arden thrown in help describe Danielle's style. Take a chance. You won't be dissapointed."
5,Great show,"My wife and I can't wait to watch the next episode. We already bought season 3, a must watch for everyone. Love it"
5,Never thought I'd love a PBS show,My wife and I are loving this series! We really connect with a lot of the characters and are anxious to see their stories develop. It's a refreshing change from the sensationalist media that we are flooded with here in the US. I highly recommend this series!
5,love it!,"I love Downton Anney, great show! Great characters and plot. Can't wait for season 4! Great job Masterpiece Theater, writers and producers"
3,Terrible video streaming,"The content of this series is normally 5 star, but the video streaming quality was terrible so we missed a lot of the dialogue. Not good. I'll only try it again if you give us a credit or refund to do so. Thanks!"
3,"Series isn't the problem, it's Amazon Instant Video","Have loved watching Season 1&2 of Downton Abbey using Amazon Prime, but once it hit the last episode of Season 2, #9..it won't load. For three days days ""Network Down"". Everything else is working, so why isn't this!?!?!Might not be worth paying for, especially since item I ordered for Christmas wasn't eligible for the Prime shipping which was touted as part of the package. :("
5,Downton Abbey,"Fantastic with great actors, beautiful surroundings and very good storyline. Fell in love with this series. Keep them coming. The history is alive."
4,Entertaining period drama,"I try to avoid getting hooked on TV shows, but this one is only 8-ish episodes per season so it's not too much of a time commitment. Fascinating portrayal of a bygone era. I didn't expect to like this show but I was hooked after the second episode in Season 1. Lots of great acting in this show, the cast is very good overall. I have to call out Maggie Smith (AKA the crusty professor in the Harry Potter movies) in particular for her role as the dowager countess, she has some great lines."
5,Loved it...,"Love this series,,, hope it never ends!!!! Can't wait for the rest of the seasons!! Fabulous cast!! Great locations scenes..."
5,"5-star Great Mini Series, 2-star Streaming video","Loved the mini-series, with recent visits from family, I believe I have watched the first two seasons at least twice. Story still holds up the next time around, although you do have to question what they woudl do without Daisey - she seems to be in the middle of everything.As for the streaming video - two things that make the streaming Video two stars. First it does not have subtitles - why on earth is that! Second, I cannot save the file to my home NAS (Network Attached Storage) that is the whole reason I bought it. Amazon needs to fix bot of these problems."
5,Superb,Perfectly done period drama. Addictive and compelling. Superb performances Maggie Smith is the absolute dowager duchess and a haunting musical score.
5,Steady on!,"Sad times, happy times, this household perseveres. Great acting of a good story in a fabulous house. All who leave the story are sadly missed."
5,Downton Abby,"Great for those who like period pieces. I watched the whole first season in 1 weekend, I couldn't stop watching."
5,"""Downton Abbey"" grabs you and won't let go!","The ""Downton Abbey"" series is so entertaining in so many ways! I love the history and the characters are so real. The setting is beautiful and you feel transported to another time. When I received my Season 2 DVD, I popped it in the player and watched 4 episodes non-stop. I can't wait for my Season 3 to arrive!"
5,Bouchee,"Another British hit...drama that draws into daily life thus entertaining you without all the glitzy, foul, cheap filming so popular on this side of the Atlantic. Desperate Housewife...Kardashian fans don't bother you not only will not identify with this type of entertainment....you also won't ""get it""!"
5,Downton Abbey Season 2,Have watched Season 1 and 3 episodes of season 2. We are addicted. We are taping season 3 to watch afterseason 2
5,Wonderful!,It is a wonderful episode and series. I can't wait to see what comes in the next episodes. WIll Mary and Mathew ever get together?
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased the Season 2 instant video first in non-HD, and then in HD at the recommendation of Amazon due to awful visual quality, only to find that the quality of the HD version is also terrible! Season 1 came through crystal clear so why there is a difference with Season 2 I don't know...maybe because these are the original UK versions (the only thing available at present - my Season 1 is the US version)? Judging by the other reviews I am the only one who has experienced this, so maybe it is my computer although I doubt it since everything else I watch is fine. I have been enjoying this series so I am very disappointed and hope the problem is ""fixed"" soon."
4,Great acting saves the abbey,"Not a great fan even though I'm still watching all the episodes. I like the actors, like the detail of how the house works, don't like the story all that much."
5,Downton Abbey,I am really enjoying this program. I find it is a higher standard of art and intertainment than what I have seen these past 10 years. Keep up the good work. I hope it lasts as there are very few programs left which I enjoy watching with my family.
5,authentic,The acting makes the entire series seem real. Wished Amazon prime did not have such a connection problem sometimes during the viewing.
2,Season 2,Episode #2 is really slow. I wish I knew they were for free on PBS. Hopefully the rest of the episodes pick up.Plus Lady Mary Crawley is tiring. Im tired of her character and Matthew for that matter.
4,Aristocracy and the working class,"It is interesting to me in how the aristocracy treated the working class with considerable dignity in England during this period of time, although I am not supportive of the extreme classicism of that time."
4,Loved watching the show this way but...,"I loved seeing season 2 of Downton Abbey on my IPad, but the constant buffering and momentary loss of video that occurred throughout made it a real trial. Love of the show gave me the patience to get keep going with it!"
5,LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!!! I lost a night of sleep watching the entire season...,"I had seen marketing for this series but had not been particularly drawn to it. But, with the impending Season 3, I read that even Michelle Obama wanted the scoop on what would be happening. I thought, OK I have got to see what all the fuss is about.I am hooked!!! I love all the characters, the writing, the direction, the imagery, the performances!! It is wonderful and addictive. I hope this series runs for a very long time."
5,A wedding at last,"Who doesn't like a good wedding scene?This one does not disappoint and the season brings a lot of turns and surprises, the plot thickens and we are drawn even deeper in this falling of era and the precarious future of Downton Abbey and its family and servants."
2,"poor quality DVD, case arrived broken","The whole picture doesn't appear on the tv screen. The subtitles are only partly visible, part on one side of the screen and part on the other side. The container of the DVD's arrived broken altho the discs weren't damaged."
4,Worth Watching,SURPRISINGLY GOOD - better then the first season. Many twists and turns and unexpected events. I was glad I got these.
5,Downton Abbey,Love this series. My 10 year-old daughter and I are addicted! Wonderful to watch a series without worrying about the language or explicit scenes. Have watched all 3 seasons and can't wait for the 4th.
5,Landed Gentry,Excellent opportunity to drift away for a while into the historical aristocracy of the landed gentry of England. Always interesting and even dramatic at times!
5,What television was invented to do,"I can hardly wait for season 3 to be broadcast in early 2013. I have season 1&2 on DVD..............treat yourself; start with season 1, don't start the DVD until you are prepared to watch because to get the true flavor for the entire series you need to watch the first 15 min. uninterrupted ."
5,great series...can't wait for more,True to life situations....great character development. Made me laugh and cry along with the upstairs and downstairs families. Highly recommend.
5,Classy and Trashy - perfect combination!,"Wonderful mix of great acting, sets, costumes, and unadulterated soapy drama. Very interesting pace of the show moves the plot and characters through time quickly without feeling like you missed anything."
3,Good show marred by lack of captions,"This show would have gotten 5 stars from me if captions had been available, and the streaming videos were the main reason I signed up for Amazon Prime. It is inexplicable to me that a show like this would be broadcast on Amazon Prime without captions. There are hundreds of millions of hearing impaired people around the world, and it only takes a little diminishment of hearing ability to miss a lot of the dialog, especially with the unfamiliar British accents of the characters. Since apparently none of the videos on this service offer captions I opted not to upgrade my trial membership."
3,Content great but viewing not so great.,"I was looking forward to viewing all 9 episodes to catch up on missed ones. However, each episode was interrupted 1 to 3 times by a poor connection. I had to reboot my router and exited the website to reconnect. That helped for a time but then had to repeat that. I have little or no problem with Netflix."
5,Downtown abbey is awesome,"This is a fun family event to wittness, safe for any age...refreshing. We hope that they continue to produce this story."
5,great drama!,"complex characters..interesting interwoven history.. upstairs and downstairs provides a glimpse into the life of the ""upper""class.Look forward to season 3."
4,Good series,This is a good series but a little soap opera. I do like the historical aspect which deals with the people and their way of life.
5,Great show Love every minute of it,This is the best show on TV right now. Great acting and many great story lines. I hope it continues.
5,I love DowntonAbbey,Trying to catch up... I am new to Downton Abbey. Started watching Season 3 and need to fill in the background
5,Fantastic!,"One of the best series I've ever seen! Would definitely recommend to everyone. Entertaining, captivating, lots of suspense and even some action."
5,Love it - NOW,"I had seen a few episodes of Downton on PBS, season 1, and wondered what all the hype was about. Seemed like just another period piece, with fancy dresses and more money than brains 'upstairs', and overworked and unappreciated servants 'downstairs. The classic (for then and maybe still) story of a 'royal' marrying an American heiress to bail out the family fortune. Maggie Smith (love her) was perfect, but I found it hard to 'like' any of the others.After watching both Seasons 1 and 2 from the beginning, I have changed my mind a bit. And am looking forward to Season 3's release."
2,"EXCELLENT SERIES, WHY NO SUBTITLES?","My family and I love this series and after enjoying the first season with Netflix, we were pleased to find that we could stream Season 2 using amazon prime. Unfortunately, unlike the Netflix product, Amazon does not provide subtitles, which makes streaming of limited use for family members who are non-native English speakers, those with hearing impairments, or those who simply are not used to various English accents. We were particularly disappointed to learn this only AFTER we had paid and started streaming the first episode. I understand that Amazon has exclusive rights to Downton Abbey Season 2. What a shame we won't be watching it here. Hope that they work on getting a subtitled product like their competitors did for Season 1."
5,"Downton Abbey, A house in history","I bought this video $0.00 in Amazon in my Amazon Video, I love to watch this movie relaxed in bed at home instead to drive to the City. I recommended, I love it."
5,DowntonAbby Season 2,"I like the characters and the setting. Shows the relationship between the help and the family. The history is interesting. Downton Abby, Season 2"
5,I am addicted to Downton Abby!!!,I missed season 2 and low and behold Amazon Prime had it!! It is intriguing and captivating! Its a refreshing break from all the graphic sex and violence on TV. Its done tastefully!
5,Still awesome,"Season 2 lived up to season 1. Still and awesome show that is hard to resist. My wife and I love watching it together, we just wish it was not so addictive."
4,Excellent period piece.,"Praise for this continuation of the Downton Abbey spectacular. Fine plots and subplots, twists, turns -- unexpected but delightful character developments. A great moment in entertainment."
5,Best thing I've watched in a long time...,The characters are developing constantly--nothing static about them. The story lines are continuing seamlessy from season one. I just wish I could watch it more than once on Amazon Prime...
5,Outstanding,"Downton Abbey is what we've been missing for years if not decades on TV. Loved Season 1, and Season 2 is just what we expected and more. I've heard of this show not long ago and with my daughter we watched all the episodes during the winter brake.Really love this Masterpiece."
1,defective disc,One of the discs was defective and skipped a whole section of the disc. The other 2 discs were fine. Came in the mail and I threw the envelope out so not sure how to return it.
1,To be fair to thetimeisnow...,"Sept 22, 2012I went to order Masterpiece Classic Downton Abbey Season 3, and stop thought I don't have Downton Abbey Season 2. Started looking back and found that I order Downton Abbey Season 2 back in March,2012...but I didn't get it...look everywhere....I love the Downton Abbey.... I found that the Post Office deliver it to someone else and I was not paying attention. I can't hold thetimeisnow responsible for what the Post Office did."
1,disappointment,"I ordered both season one and season two if Downton Abby as a gift Christmas gift. I had no problem waiting until February for season two to arrive and because I've always had great luck with Amazon, I had no reason to open and review the cd when it did arrive. Besides, it was a gift so of course I didn't open it. So, when I did view the cd in May, I was very disappointed to find what should have been Season Two of Downton Abby is actually random portions of Season one! It's not even the entire season! The return policy is 30 days. I guess I've been taken!"
1,Nowhere close to Netflix,The video takes forever to load and freezes often. Will never rent again. Netflix is infinitely better. I gave up halfway through the episodes.
2,The series is good but he sound is awful. I will rent from Netflix.,"It's all in the title. The series is good - I am enjoying it. The free to Amazon Prime Series 1 sounded fine but the purchased Series 2, Episode 1 has terrible sound. I will rent the rest from Netflix."
5,One of the very best,"Fantastic series! Watched the entire season is two nights. Maggie smith is just wonderful, as well as Jim Carter and all of the other staff"
2,Disappointing,"I found season one for Downton Abbey to be a real masterpiece. However, after watching season two, I was quite disappointed. Each episode and in fact, the whole of season two, came across to me as ""rushed, poorly put together, poor scripting."" Everything I loved most aboutseason one, I found lacking terribly in season two - cinematograpy, character and story development, etc.I hope Julian Fellowes and company take their time on season three and restore Downton Abbey to its original ""masterpiece"" status. Do away with these trivial sub-plots!"
2,i liked the 1st season.,"I really liked the first season, but at the end of the season they announce WW1, now it is too much of a war drama and I lost intrest. I do not care to see trenches and explosions. I hate action films."
4,Interesting stories!!,Wish you had close caption. English accent is at times hard to understand. Will you be offering close caption soon?
3,Good things and not-so-good things,"I guess because it is an ongoing drama, it has to be, but I don't like not having anything resolved. I don't like the fact that there is so much hiding and covering one's feelings and ending up being unhappy. It is a sad thing to constantly see the villain- Thomas - get away with everything all the time. I do like the fact that it does not portray sexual scenes. I rather wish I had not started in the series."
4,Great,Nice way to catch up on missed shows. I definitely will be using this method to catch up on all that I have not watched. Thankyou for offering this service.
5,Downton again!,"I couldnt stop watching.Spent way too many late nights trying to race to the end...Addicting, mesmerizing, surprizing, wonderful cast"
3,...too 21st Century!,I was drawn in then pushed away for all the reasons others have said. DA 2 was written from a 21st century perspective and it's characters would fit right in comfortably today. Too bad.
1,There is no closed captioning available and no opportunity to cancel!,"Nothing against Downton Abbey the TV series, but I have a lot against amazon.com's digital service if I'm unable to be refunded for a series which I'm unable to watch."
2,Underwhelmed.,"I find that I'm severely underwhelmed by Downton Abbey. As much as I like many of the actors/actresses in the cast, the writing is average at best and the characters too variable and inconsistent to sustain an engaging drama. Part of this is due to the fact that the creators cannot commit to the defining parameters. Is this a soap opera or is it a serious drama? The two are mutually exclusive genres."
3,Not entirely happy,The series is good but we recieved an US region disc 3 (even though it say UK edition). Amazon where good and sent us another set but that had exactly the same problem (discs 1 & 2 worked fine as where UK disc 3 didn't work as said US region - neither work on my PC either which has a region free player).Gave up and will wait for to be on sale at the shops.
5,Downton Abbey is FABULOUS!,"From the first show of Season 1, I was hooked! The cast is marvelous...Dame Maggie Smith is superb in her role as the matriarch...and the intertwining story lines keep you coming back for more. Anxiously awaiting Season 3 beginning January 6 in the U.S."
5,Very enjoyable,"In this DVD of season 2 you see more from the characters you know... lots of new developments, and nobody's happy."
5,"Actors, writing, cinematography - this is the best of it all.","Actors, writing, cinematography - this is the best of it all. The cast is fantastic. The history is accurate. The writing is intelligent and captivating. This is a brilliant show."
5,Love it!,This is such a great show that not a lot of people know about. I am so glad I was able to download it for free with my amazon prime account.
5,SPLENDID ERA PIECE,THE PRODUCERS HAVE METICOUSOULY PRESENTED THE INTER WEAVINGS OF THE PERSONALITIES SUPERB COSTUMING THE VEHICLES DEPICTED CHANGE WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME AS THE METICILOUS RENDERING OF ARTIFICATS ONE WOULD EXPECTIN DOWNTOWN
5,Awesome.,This series is a new addiction. It is so easy to get involved with this family and friends. There is something intriguing and endearing about every character.
5,"Downton Abbey, Season 2","Downton Abbey, Season 2 is just as entertaining as Season 1. One gets lost in all the extravagance; the set decoration, the costumes, the house and the wonderful acting. So much attention to detail is appreciated by this viewer and I long for more from this amazing ensemble cast. Maggie Smith should get an Oscar for this one....just love her."
5,Part 4 Best Turning Point of Series,Part four is for me where it all is at. A lot of the stories from the beginning of this series are tied together in some ways. I like this episode a lot.
5,Best Show Ever Seen on PBS Downton Abbey,I have never enjoyed watching a series as much as Downton Abbey. I cannot wait to see the next episode!
5,Best series ever!,"What a great series! Drama, romance, and history all wrapped up in one! So happy to have learned about it and it is truly a masterpiece."
5,Can't stop watching!,"Best series ever. Beautiful setting, costumes, actors and content. Want to own every season. Well worth the investment and time."
5,Incredible,This series is so engaging and rich that I fully expected my hand to vibrate when I touched the package when it was delivered.
5,Never a Downer but a Ton of Great Storytelling,"Masterpiece Theatre production of ""Downton Abbey"" continues its excellence. The cast is quite formidable, especially the great Maggie Smith.She is one of England's treasures. Even though they are the upper class you care about the members of the household upstairs and downstairs.The only negative I have is that one of the discs was warped and the pixels kept breaking up. All of the other discs were in perfect condition."
5,It doesn't get any better....,"There is no better television available anywhere today- this is top-notch in all areas of content and production! No sooner had I started watching the series via a different source, I devoured it and came to Amazon to purchase the next season. It's THAT good."
4,This UK version is slightly better,"This UK version of the series is better because it seems to use slightly different cuts of some parts and some of the terminology used seems to be different. All of this adds up and, seeing this version is better and the storyline makes more sense than the version they seem to have cut for the US PBS version.It isn't all that much different but, these subtleties seem to make a difference and makes one wonder why either PBS or more likely, the UK producers thought they needed to make a ""US"" version at all!"
5,adored season 2,this program is better than any movies playing today in local theaters. The acting is outstandingand the story line gets better and better each session.
5,Best ever,"Anyone that watches this series only wants more. If all television was this good, people would read less - God forbid. It's sad once the season ends."
5,Downton Abbey,"My husband and I are both hooked. Great cast, great costumes, great story. Do not want this series to end."
5,Amazing Show!,"Having a glimpse of an early to mid 1900s Brittish family has truly been a treat. There is something so compelling about the characters, you never want to stop watching! This is truly a classic!"
5,"intrigue, drama, suspense","All the above descriptions apply to DA, season 2. Time travel back to WWI era reminds me of my English history classes in college, yet the trials and challenges experienced by these characters are timeless."
1,Ordered the wrong thing!,"I cannot get my $ back because I ordered the wrong thing and now I ""own it."" Son-of-a-gun, I will not sit at my computer and watch this thing. (I'm over 70)"
1,Show is great Love it,But part 2 has a dics missingpart of the show is missingdon't know what happend but when i opened it1 of the shows is not there
