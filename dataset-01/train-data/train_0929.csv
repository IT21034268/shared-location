4,Fills in an important gap on the German-Soviet war,"An excellent book which gives an insight into how the Red Army's strategic thinking evolved after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. For the first time we do not only get the German side of the picture but the Russian one. Moreover, this episode is usually only dealt with very briefly in most histories. This book offers a wealth of detail on this almost neglected period which is usually only described as a footnote in books on Fall Blau. I especially liked the fact that we first read the Soviet official report which is then followed by a critical comment. The only criticism I have concerns the maps. One: I hate computer generated maps of this kind, two: I would have added arrows indicating directions of attack and lines reached (I have added them in my copy in red)."
4,About Bruce,There is some amount of mystical sub plot here - but all the rest is Bruce Lee. This is as good a representation of his actual life as anyone has made to date.
4,"The Real ""Game of Death""","Though ""A Warrior's Journey"" provides an insightful overview of Bruce Lee's life and art, the unfinished ""Game of Death"" remains the documentary's focal point. For years, martial-arts aficionados have debated the merits of Lee's ambitious project, which died with him in 1973. Based on Lee's notes, historian John Little has painstakingly assembled the existing 32 minutes in the context that Lee intended. The surviving remnants from ""Game of Death"" display Lee's maturity as a filmmaker and martial artist who was striving for more realism and less fantasy in Hong Kong action cinema. Long overdue, ""A Warrior's Journey"" erases the bad taste of ""Bruce Lee's Game of Death"" - a 1979 fiasco that made money yet pleased no one."
1,BEWARE OF THE US DVD VERSION!!,"I bought this DVD today, and I am very disappointed. On the package it advertises special features: audio commentary by the director, a special enactment of the script shot in Korea, and a music video for the song ""Ode to An Artist"". None of these things are actually on the DVD. It is misleading, if not downright fraudulent, and I am going to demand a refund."
5,At Last The Real Game of Death,"This DVD at last attempts (and succeeds) in portraying the essence of Bruce Lee's art and the Game of Death's real storyline. Fantastic original footage of the Game of Death - with dialogue together with credible interviews with those who knew him are woven into the footage. The last 30 minutes are a definite highlight. There are also plenty of exerpts from other movies, home movies and TV appearances to savour as well."
5,Insight to the brilliance of Bruce Lee,"For any Bruce Lee fan, finding footage of him is always a joy. Seeing what Bruce Lee intended for the actual Game of Death rights the travesty that was released by Hollywood as the ""Game of Death."" I always had heard of what Bruce Lee had intended for the Game of Death as having a multi-level pagoda that had different disciplines on each level. That was cool. Seeing the footage and learning what he really intended instead of just rumors was better than what I had hoped. Watching a documentary on Bruce Lee and seeing more footage of him in films and home movies than I had before will make me treasure this DVD all the more.A great buy for any Bruce Lee fan and even those that are curious to know more about one of the most influential martial artists and Asian Americans."
3,Great product in cheap packaging,"I love all of Bruce Lee's products and this is also a great product with which I was not disappointed. However, for the price I paid for it, the CD/DVD could have been packaged in a a better-quality case than the Wal-Mart-like case it was wrapped in. I intend to keep this for a long time and that is why I thought you might just pull up your socks on packaging. Otherwise, as for the movie itself, excellent, but that is to Bruce Lee's credit because he was a perfectionist."
4,Included as an extra on Enter the Dragon (Two-Disc Special Edition),This program is included as an extra on Enter the Dragon (Two-Disc Special Edition).
3,not affordable,i feel sorrrry for this band... they try but technically could not affor this music from GREAT MICKE KATZ
5,Wonderful Story!,"Having grown up in the south, and living very near the setting of this story added to the joy of it all. So far at least five of my family members have read this on my recomendation - all have called to say ""Thank you"". If you want to remember what warmth and goodness are, or if you want to meet them for the first time, this is a great story to read!Thank you Fannie!"
4,Things Can Change,"A Red Bird Christmas is a story about kind, charitable, and talented people. The main character is a man who would be considered a loser. He's divorced, is seriously sick, has never been successful with jobs, and lives in a boarding house in Chicago. He takes a chance and moves down South. There he meets people and an animal that will change his life forever. The story has just a drop a sugery sweetness but that's okay. Ms Flagg has written a novel that has no violence or sarcasim. It's a lovely Christmas story. Read it and cry for happiness. Believe in people."
4,A Redbird Christmas,"Really 4 1/2 stars. This was such an endearing book. The characters were great, you felt like you knew all of them and loved all of them. A feel good book. The character development was just incredible, even the ancillary characters. I would definitely reccomend this book."
5,Warm and Sincere,"Fannie Flagg is one of the few authors that can tell a touching story without getting bogged down in the character's emotions. The reader is allowed to feel for each character. This book is thoroughly engrossing. Really -- I laughed, I cried...and loved it."
3,A feel good book great for a Christmas Read,Kind of an old fashion story situated in the South. Every one ends up just doing fine. Delightful easy read.
4,Witty yet Bittersweet,"I've read all of Fannie Flagg's books and she has never dissappointed me. Her books are not fluff, they are thoughtful, funny and sometimes pleasantly quirky. I purchased this book through Amazon.com from ""Trinity City Books"" in Texas (cost approximatey: $2.50). Considering the quick delivery and great condition of the book I would definitely buy from them again."
4,Hope abounds in Lost River,"I've loved this book since the first time I read it several years ago. I shared it with some friends, who also promptly fell in love with it. So, this year, one of them asked if I knew where she could buy it, and so I bought it from Amazon --a beautiful hand-bound edition-- and gave it to her for her birthday. She was thrilled. Fanny Flagg's inimitable wit and charm abound in this book, and her favorite theme of family and close community relationships brings hope and good health ( mental and physical) back to the protagonist, a Chicagoan suffering from emphysema and all the health problems that come along with that condition. What an uplifting, funny, hopeful book!"
4,Gentle gift,"Fannie Flagg has give us a gentle gift in ""A Redbird Christmas."" Her telling of the journey of a man from the threshold of emotional oblivion to the bosom of a community whose kindess and quirks heal his wounds reminds us all that relationships are important and that simple joys can be the most profound.My only criticism is that the book ends a bit abruptly.All in all, a sweet and comforting read."
4,Get Ready For Warm Fuzzies!,"I had to read this book for a book club I belong to and faced it with some dread. I was hooked by the second page! Maybe it was because I live in the area of the Florida Panhandle near where the story takes place and the people resonate with my neighbors. Yes, the story is predictable and the characters needed to be fleshed out more but maybe I feel that way because I liked the book so well and loved the characters so much that I just didn't want the book to end!"
4,A Redbird Christmas,A good story that is entertaining to read that develops the characters in depth. You get the feel of this small town asyou meet and get to know thetownspeople .
3,Cozy sappy,"I have loved Fannie Flagg books, but this one is just too unrealistic and almost silly. I have no idea where she comes up with these quirky characters but they are all there. I would love to move to the toqn of ""Lost River"". I loved the little girl Patsy but the rest of the cast of characters you can leave. I expected much more and I got tired of listening to Ms. Flaggs voice. I wish she would get professional readers for her books. It just got to be to mundane with her voice through 5 CD's.I love the idea of the novel, but this Redbird did not fly for me..."
4,A Redbird Christmas,"This is a nice ""feel good"" story in which Fanny Flagg suggests that simple, wholesome, small town values among caring friends can bring about healing of both physical and emotional woes. As in all of Fanny Flagg's stories, there is a lot of humor and some quirky characters. It may not have enough excitement for young folks but others will get a nice ""warm, fuzzy"" feeling. It makes a great Christmas gift."
5,redbird family christmas,"This is another great work of Fannie Flagg ! I would rank this as one of her best books ,it has that southern flavor with good character development and touches the heart as all her books do!I remember watching Fannie on channel 6 in Birmingham Al. and tried to keep up with her thru the years.....although shes a character herself and i enjoyed watching her over the years ---writing is her ''stuff'' !read this book -you'll feel better! john d."
3,A Redbird Christmas,"A heart warming story as the title suggests. Not a""gripping page turner"", but a comforting Fannie Flaggentertainment."
5,Enchantment on Each Page,"Fanny Flagg delivers a Christmas tale to delight even the Grinch (and Scrooge too) - why even my sister loved it! With slush in his shoes and a life that lacks color, Oswald T. Campbell bids farewell to a bleak and wintry Chicago after the doctor delivers an unexpected death sentence. A very old brochure magically directs Oswald to Lost River, Baldwin County, Alabama, for his last months. As Oswald settles in, life suddenly becomes Technicolor and the kind of ""family is where you find it"" interaction gives all the characters of Lost River a reason to live and love. Jack, the redbird, is conniving little pest who knits the disparate characters into a wonderful whole.This is an easy recommendation for ALL ages. About halfway through the book, my reading slowed down, I savored each page, and knew that more enchantment would appear but that it would eventually end. Sigh. Mamalinda has already bought several copies for gifts."
4,I liked it!,We read this book for bookclub this past Christmas and I really enjoyed the story line easy to follow. It wasn't a page turner but still liked it.
2,Disappointing,"I just finished A Redbird Christmas. Our book club chose it for the December meeting. I was very disappointed in the book. The characters never seemed to ""flesh out"". I also could never figure out the time period of the book. The language was of the 1940's or 1950's, but then something would appear, like tatoos or $100,000 for surgery - very confusing. The best part of the book was finding recipes at the end."
2,About as SatisfyingTomato Aspic served with Mayo! Blech,"C'mon Ms. Flagg, you can do better. I guess Fried Green Tomatos was a fluke.This is a paint-by-numbers, feel good book that could have been written by amateur writer, Dottie. The plot starts out interesting enough. Will Oswald T. Campbell live to see another Christmas? Turns out he's a minor character and so is Redbird.Flagg introduces characters that could become interesting if all their problems weren't so predicable and weren't solved with various deus ex machina-esque pretty red bows.This is an easy, pleasant read for readers who like sappy happy endings.For the literary ""snobs"" who want something deeper, look elsewhere because in the land of Lost River, Alabama, you're rowing your literary oars in cheese."
1,Simply not worth your time,"I can't stand schmaltz like this. It's simplistic and barely there. I try hard not to be a literary snob, but some things are just too childish to waste your time on. The characters are stereotypical and flat, every problem is tied up like a present with a bow, and it borders on boring. If you can stand those Mitford books, then this is your cup of tea."
3,No surprises,Enjoyable read for the money. Easy to connect with the characters. It was predictable but entertaining. Easy and quick to read.
5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"This is a book, that once you start reading it, you can't put it down.If you want a feel-good story, and you love to laugh (I laughed out loud!), then this is the book for you.I highly recommend this book!"
5,A wonderful book,"I love Fannie Flagg's books so I knew I'd enjoy this one. I was really hooked when I read that the main character was an orphan who was named Oswald T.(for tomato)Campbell for the can of soup that was in the basket when he was left outside of the orphanage.I grew up in the country near a small town and now again live in the country. There are the usual characters as in Lost River, AL.We have at least two resident cardinal couples here year round and they are at the feeders every day. They aren't as friendly as Jack. However, I'll think of him when I see them from now on.A great book with happy endings for all."
5,Just a cute book!,"The best way to describe this book is ""Cute"". The characters are richly drawn and cute. The redbird is cute. The writing is cute. The reader cannot help but feel good reading this novel. The colors and people are vivid. The reader is transported into a calm world with delightful characters. It is truly a Christmas story that is destined to become a classic. If you enjoy Fanny Flagg's writing do not miss this one."
5,A great christmas novel that will make you smile and you can read anytime of the year,"A great book from start to finish. The book will leave you smiling. The book is about Oswald T. Campbell who's doctor tells him he has just a year left to leave so he live's Chicago and heads down to Lost River, Alabama. There he meets lots of people including a redbird named Jake and a little girl named Patsy. There on christmas a miracle happends that you wont belive. The book is a christmas novel but it's not just about christmas it focus on the whole yoear so it's a book you can read anytime of the year. The book made me want to go down to Alabama and see if theres a place like this. the book has many memrable charactors and is written great. One of the best Christmas books."
2,OK book but no surprise,Sorry to say this was not a good book. Easy read and has some funny moments but not good.
3,A halfhearted effort,"Fannie Flagg relies heavily on good old-fashioned Southern-fried cliches with this one, and doesn't bother to throw in any of the wit or originality that made some of her earlier books so wonderful. Between the crippled orphan who may or may not be healed (I won't spoil it) and the star-crossed lovers who may or may not reunite and live happily ever after (what do you think?), your heart will most decidedly be warmed. However, alongside those Christmas fuzzies you may have a bit of a cheap feeling, as you wonder if you just spent more energy reading the book than Fannie spent writing it."
5,Great Christmas book!,"I started reading it one night and couldn't put it down! I highly recommend it, especially during the Christmas season."
4,Red Bird Christmas by Fannie Flagg,Another good book by Fannie Flagg. This book was an easy read and well worth the purchase. An interesting read about the a small town in the southern United States.
5,Great Book for the Christmas Season,This book was an early Christmas Gift for a young 20-something girl who is learning the pleasure of reading. She was enthralled with the book and more enthusiastic for reading than before.
5,Perfect for the Excel user,"I started reading this book because I was interested in creating decision support systems for Microsoft Excel. Because of time constraints, i did not get to read the whole book. However, the first 6 or 7 chapters of this book have helped me grasp the basics of VBA perfectly. I have saved a great many hours (spent previously doing repetitive mind-numbing tasks in excel) by writing a few simple lines of code (and remember, I have very little programming experience). I hope to learn even more by reading the whole book, but trust me, this book is worth its price, just for the first few chapters"
5,Excellent Book. More then satisfied !!!,"Absolutely agree with Mr.Weiqin Xie. I took this book from corporative library with intention to get help for my first degree completion project in Industrial management, where I really needed to increase my productivity in processing a lot of data,and just can't bring it back extending my holding over and over again. I have already ordered it and waiting for delivery. I not only successfully completed the project but started to develop useful utilities in my job and decision support application for my investments needs and all of this owing to just few first chapters."
5,Excellent,Many Excel VBA books are a bunch of clever examples that you won't be able to apply to anything. This is the only book I have found with good examples about how to move around a spreadsheet using VBA. For some reason this is left out of most books.
4,Really good stuff,"I bought the book to get up to speed with VBA and I found the pace of the book good with some excellent examples which I found reasonably easy to understand. Good sections to test your knowledge at the end of each chptr ""well advised to do these it really helped me"". Only missed out on 5 stars as some areas we lightly covered."
4,Nice Book,It's a very nice book. makes it simple for Excel 2003. I hope we should get same kind of book for Excel 2007. This is my text book for my masters.
3,Not what they are marketing!,"This is not definitely a book for someone that doesn't know the basics of VBA. Even that the book claims to be useful for beginners, which is the main marketing hook, many things simply doesn't makes any sense if you don't have some background in VBA. I recommend this book for anyone with an intermediate or advance level knowledge of VBA, who wants to get an insight on how to use its power for developing ""management science type"" modeling solutions."
1,Did not receive correct item,"I do not know how often this kind of stuff happens with 3rd party sellers, but it happened to me. I ordered FAQ frequently asked question and when I got the package the wrong dvd was in the case. I was not super upset, but just disappointed that I did not get the item I ordered. I will make sure to not purchase anything from this seller in the future to avoid this happening again. Amazon refunded my purchase promptly."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I am the mother of a 15 month old now and everytime I have referenced this book, it has been inaccurate with something. Hep B according to every other source is an immunization that children should receive whether the mother tested positive or not; this source states it as optional. I have the mayo clinic book and what to expect the first year and toddler years and they have proven to be the most accurate. I would not trust this book."
3,Are boys really that much more difficult?,"I'm expecting my first, and halfway through this book I became very concerned about Dr.Stoppard's view in raising boys. It seemed that in every single point-by-point comparison, girls far outshine boys in terms of cleaniness, behavior, needs ... in general, girls were portrayed as little angels while boys are much more difficult, aggressive, prone to playing with thier feces, twice as long to potty-train, etc. etc. Is this the truth?? I'm getting scared if I have a boy. Did other readers find her views a little skewed in favor of girls? On the other hand, her ""Conception, Pregnancy & Birth"" book is excellent."
4,A good choice,"I like that this book breaks developmental stages down into age levels and sometimes even further into months. I referred to this book often when my daughter was a newborn. GREAT illustrations...photographs of real babies and parents and items! What I didn't like were the 2-page bios of babies with special needs or developmental issues. None of them pertained to my situation, and because they were so short anyone with that problem probably wouldn't get a lot of help. However, this was just a small part of the book. Overall the information given was very good, never preachy, and very thorough."
3,very good,Why can't this be shipped to countries other than US.Is there any Indian agents for this.If not I would like to be . send your feed backregardssudha
4,1 yr old has fun,daughter likes this. she has an easier time with the knobby puzzles at her young age.
5,terrible two fun,"We gave this puzzle to our two year old nephew and he spent alot of time playing with it and loved surprising us with the pictures beneath the puzzle pieces.this product is very well made, and the price is right."
5,Excellent writing with a surprise ending,"I actually enjoyed the unique style of writing by Mr. Harris. It is written almost entirely in dialogue. The book iscreatively and excellently written. The story is easy to follow,and it is certainly a page-turner.Excellent!"
1,Sorry I bought the book,"The story was written using almost all dialag. I did not care for the writing style, although the plot was good. Long before the end I figured out the twist. I am also an amateur genealogist and the book was light on genealogy and way too heavy on genetics - really lost me at times."
2,Turd Uk'n,"Tried the Turducken this year. I was very disappointed. The bird doesn't stay together like the photos you see. After it's cooked, you don't know to slice or scoop out the bird. There was very little turkey meat on the outside and the inside had more rice than duck or sausage. Plus, it was dry. There were no juices when I cooked it. Luckily, we also cooked a traditional turkey which fed everyone. After all said and done, after $110, the Turducken was stuffing. I will never buy again."
3,Not exactly as advertised.,The Tur-Duc-Hen I ordered was advertized having corn bread stuffing and sausage. The one I received was stuffed with only rice. The bird itself was good and delivery was fast. If it was not for the mix up between rice and corn bread stuffing I would have given this Item a 4 out of 5.
3,Pretty Good,"Let me caveat this by saying I paid $10 for this product at my local Kroger and with that, I was more than pleased with it. The turkey was good as was the duck. I have not detected any hen as of yet, but no big deal. The stuff was very tasty, though the way we cooked it, in a raised pan, caused some of it to fall out of the bottom. We thawed it for 4 days and followed the cooking directions, but still had to cut the legs off and split the beast in half to cook for another 45 minutes. My family was pleased with the results and we had an enjoyable Christmas dinner. Based on what I paid, I would give this 5 stars. If I had paid over $100, I would give it 1 star."
1,Not worth it.,"This ""dictionary"" is more or less based on visits to a few American organ-builders and a few large organs. The reader should be warned that there are several inaccuracies in this book. Cross referencing is highly reccommended! The price of this book outweighs it's value."
5,A Small Wonder!,"Me and my dad are in love with Grey Delisle and we don't even know her!The Small Time is an old fashioned ,heart-felt, masterpiece full of whiskey,pick-ups,catchy hooks and d-i-v-o-r-c-e ---just the way real country was meant to be. We highly recommend this record and we've been known to be two downright picky bastards!Buy this cd but be careful ----you just may get your heart stolen, too!"
4,Needs a Sequel!!!,"I thought Twilight of Courage was a great book. I like reading stories about World war 2, and I thought this story really captured the meaning of the war and the real life struggles. The one thing that it could use is a sequel. It leaves you hanging and wanting to know what will happen next. Other than that I thought it deserves a round of applause."
5,IT MADE ME THINK,THE BOOK'S INTERTWINED STORIES AND QUESTIONS OF MORALS IN A TIME OF WAR MADE ME QUESTION MY OWN MORALS.
5,"Fine, sweeping WWII epic in search of a sequel.","Excellent historical novel with enough situations and characters to give a feel for the huge sweep of the war itself, but needs a sequel to finish the history and the stories."
3,A step down,"I was disappointed with this continuation of the Zion Covenant story. My key frustration was the lack of vital dynamic relationships between the key characters and God. In the other Zion books, characters wrestled with questions about God's role in the devastation around them. In Twilight, such heart-changing action is relegated to side characters."
2,diappointed,I was expecting the author to go into more detail on the characters. It was just a mashing together of all the Zion books.I truly love these authors but they leave you longing to know more of the characters. There delivery of the time in history is great.
3,Coming of Age Story....,"Wannabe, a coming of age story, focuses on caucasion Kimmy growing up in a primarily Cuban-American neighborhood in West New York. Each chapter is a mini-short story that will remind you of yourself as a young girl, approaching and delving into your teenage years. From getting along with the girls, wearing make-up and liking boys, all of the events and angsts of a young girl are explored with humor and touches of advise & wisdom. Kathy Coudle King does a good job of remembering what it's like to be a young girl moving into adulthood, searching to find oneself and achieve self-acceptance."
2,Don't Bother,"Looking at the cast of actors one would think a good movie was in the offering. I knew Shelley Long wasn't a very good actress but I hoped the rest could pull this movie through.The basic idea for the movie is pretty cool: Santa is captured by a little girl (Judy Emerson played by Sierra Abel who is just a dreadful actress) and hauled off to jail by the local Keystone cops. OK, OK, it's a little hokey I know but I thought it had potential.The dialogue was just awful. Everyone, including the good actors spoke in monotone and appeared to be reading their lines off cue cards. The camerawork was average with several occasions of un-centered characters and shifting too soon. Scenes in the beginning of the movie were shifting faster than a NFL quarterback running from Ray Lewis.Other than these complaints the movie was fine."
4,The Santa Trap,"I received the movie in the time period specified. The movie itself is cute, but dated."
5,"If you like ""Le Bad Cinema"" this movie's a classic!","I first saw this movie on a bus in the middle of rural China, and I knew it was a ""keeper."" This movie is a wacky, inoffensive screwball comedy, which has virtually nothing to do with reality. To see it as I did, on a bus in the midst of rural China, only added to the absurdity.The ""plot"" features a dorky magician named Canon Wong (does anybody get what that might mean in English? I mean this movie was made in Hong Kong...), who gets marooned on a desert island with a bevy of beauties some of whom think he's trying to seduce them.The movie features wacky inoffensive musical numbers on rythim instruments, the finding of costumes for not other apparent reason than that the director had them around, and a guy in a gorilla suit.Get this movie! It will change your life...well, maybe not..."
5,Smooth Sailing...,"If you're looking for some great background music for work, reading, or for smoothing-out your driving in heavy traffic situations where some beautiful sounds might help to sooth your savage beast... slip in this CD. It puts me in a very peaceful place... in fact I had in my car's CD for about a week before I took it out. This will help you let-off and relax."
3,Road Movie,"Just recently rented this movie. The plot was a little slow, but all three of leads were great! A must for cult freaks!"
5,Great calculator!,"I've had this calculator for about 5 years now. I use it everywhere -- in the office, the kitchen, the shop...it's perfect. Tough, easy to see, big buttons. It's a really well-designed simple calculator."
3,Okay but not great,"It is good but compared to the other one I have, office depot brand, it is just okay. The problem is that the number screen dips away from you making it harder to see and closer to what using a traditional non desktop (flat) calculator feels like. It is thin and not easy to see. The design is okay I like the silver color but it is not a sheet of real metal like the other one. In short it is just okay ergonomically and cosmetically but I'm sure it is durable as it is made by TI. Don't expect anything more than a basic calculator."
5,"Nice design, works well, great value","This is a well-designed, simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large, easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time, and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g., has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times."
2,keys are on the other side?,"Very attractive calculator, but note that it's discontinued. On/Off, +/-, % are all on the left side and I just couldn't get used to it."
4,Nice and large,"Nice and large, but needs slightly better pads on the bottom to grip the table surface for those times when you're entering numbers wildly to keep the unit from sliding a bit. Overall, its just what I needed."
5,Great Calculator,I love this calculator. It is easy to use. It is just the right size. I have used other calculators and this one is by far my favorite.
1,defective,I PURCHASED THIS ITEM IN JULY AND THE NUMBER 9 IS FROZEN IN THE WINDOW.I CAN NOT ENTER ANY NUMBERS OR DELETE THE #9. HOW DO I RETURN THIS ITEM?
5,Perfect calculator,We were looking for a calculator that was large enough to actually use our fingers instead of some kind of pointer to hit the keys with. Seems like most were either too small or jumbo size (way too large) This one was just right and at a good price too.
4,Texas Instruments TI1795SV Solar Calculator,"In the spring of 2000 I went to Peru to help a rural commumity build a school for the local children. Needless to say, they had almost nothing in the way of school supplies. I bought a number of these solar calculators to donate to the new school. I chose the TI1795SV because the large display and large buttons. The children and teachers did not need a complex calculator but more than just plus and minus; so this one fit the bill just right. Also, because this community is poor and has limited access to technology the solar cells of the calculator will keep it up and running even if the battery were to lose power. It was a little bulky to carry 20 of these to Peru but well worth the looks on their faces when I donated them. All-in-all a worthwhile investment!"
4,LARGE KEYS,Has large keys. The angle of your eye to display needs to be adjusted then you see well.I'm done.
2,The TI-1795SV calculator,I purchased this item at the Navy Exchange yesterday thinking it was a good price. It looked good in the plastic wrapping but now that I have it on my desk at home I'm not real happy with it. It is cheaply made although it looks okay. The buttons on it are not set well and some are loose and you twist them to make them upright. I always thought Texas Instruments made great products but not sure now.....email me at jerryjackson@hawaii.rr.com.
4,another good one!,"Although perhaps not Bill Harley's best, this was still far and away better than the vast majority of kids' stuff out there. I'd get ""Battle of the Mad Scientists"" before this one, if you had to choose one over the other; but still worth purchasing in its own right."
5,A Grammy Nominee! We LOVE Moonpies!,"We are fortunate to live in Bill Harley's neck of the woods, and have seen him perform several times. This CD is a favorite, for both my own children and my fifth graders.We all sing the Moonpie song, and we have been heard to say, ""Put your tray in the window, there's no seconds for you, you're done for the day.""Bill Harley rocks!!"
3,Wish there was something better,"I've had to replace these a few times. They don't last forever, but I assumed they'd last more than a couple of years. At $15 a pop, it isn't so much to replace them even once a year, but it is hard to trouble shoot that this is the part that went bad when the lights don't go on. Yeah, I know, just disconnect the thing and see - but it isn't that easy since you have to move the low voltage wiring to the lights to different terminals on the transformer when installing this or removing it. By the way, to everyone who says they can't figure out how to connect it? Every one of these I've bought has included instructions. And if it doesn't, just Google ""ML814PR instructions"" and the very first link that shows up is the full instructions. Here's a link to them (if Amazon will let me include it): [...]"
2,Worked great while it lasted!!,"I bought this unit November 2007. Mine did come with instructions, thank goodness. The unit was great and worked like a charm until April 2008 when the lights went off and the only way I could get them back on was to disconnect the photocell unit."
4,Lacks depth,"I like the doorbell and it adds a nice touch. I bought it to replace a super cheap plastic one. I wish that it came in a finish other than copper and gold. That being said, the cheap one it replaced protruded a bit from the wall like a 5 sided cover, leaving room for the push button and the wires behind it. This one is completely flat. (This could account for its reasonable price.) My house is vinyl siding and I was able to cut a hole in the siding and mush the backside into the hole. So, in my case, all's well that ends well. However, that option may not exist for everyone."
1,URGENT INFO! READ CAREFULLY!,"NOTE TO DIRECTORS: DO NOT CAST SPORTS STARS AS LEADING ACTORS, EVER! AND WHAT ABOUT THE PROP GUYS AND CONTINUITY EDITORS, THEY'RE PROBABLY THE SAME GENIUSES THAT GAVE US UNDER SIEGE 2. I JUST LOVED THE WAY THAT A CHARACTER GRABBED A ""MYSTERY AXE"" FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE. DID HE GET IT FROM JASON? ANOTHER INSTANCE IS WHERE HOWIE LONG DROVE OFF THE ROOF ON A MOTORCYLE AND IT SHOWS HIM DRIVNG OFF THE OPPOSITE SIDE THAT HE WAS AIMING FOR! YET ANOTHER INSTANCE IS HOW HOWIE GETS HIS KNEE SET BACK INTO PLACE AND HE'S GOOD AS NEW, WHY COULDN'T YOU BE LIKE THAT IN YOUR PRO DAYS, HUH? I'VE ALSO SEEN BETTER SPECIAL EFFECTS IN AN ED WOOD MOVIE."
2,Above-average budget can't save sub-par script,"Howie Long must save the girl and foil the plans of some escaped convicts during an intentionally set forest fire. Watchable, but not enjoyable script falls flat on several occassions, not the least of which is determining who set the blaze (a pathetically easy mystery to solve for anyone who's seen BACKDRAFT). Talent is wasted everywhere, including Howie Long, who has some appeal in the context of an action hero. For action fans, see it when it hits the bargain bin; For everyone else...get someone else to rent it."
2,Not an accurate portrayal of forest firefighting,"This may be above average as an action film. However, as a portrayal of forest fires and firefighting it is horrendously bad and full of technical inaccuracies. This becomes apparent during the first few minutes of the film as we see smokejumpers freefalling (they don't), and it doesn't get any better from there folks; the computer generated fire blowup at the end that burns a zillion acres at once is just as absurd. This film is also full of ridiculous stunts that would be impossible in real life, like the one-handed chainsaw throw, the head being pushed through the metal boat at the end, and that motorcycle jump through the roof of the burning building. They really should have spent some time on technical accuracy and then it might have been a halfway decent film."
2,FIRES AND A PRIDSON BREAK,OK MOVIE TOO BAD IT FOCUSES MORE ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF LONG'S AND AMIS(GIRL FROM TITANIC). THE PRISON BREAK IS OK. GOOD FOR RENTAL?ANY WORD FOR IT ON DVD?IF IT WAS ON DVD I WOULD BUY IT!GOOD EXPLOSIONS AND ACTION!
4,HEROIC HOWIE,"Sports stars turned actors have never been serious threats at the Academy awards, and big Howie Long is certainly no exception. However, with his buff bod, icy blue eyes and a hint of malevolent humor, he acquits himself quite nicely in this blazing adventure. He plays the news fire chief of the Smoke Jumpers when buddy Scott Glenn is injured in a frightening opening rescue scene. The pyrotechnics in this movie are awesome and heat up the screen (ha ha). Suzy Amis is fun as the ornithologist who just happens to walk into the thick of things; William Forsythe is painfully effective as the cold-hearted killer who offs his prison escapee buddies so he can get all of his 37,000,000 dollars! There are some mind-blowing fire scenes and the firestorm itself is awesome.A great kickbutt type of movie, and Howie's the man!!!"
3,Could have been MUCH better...,"I take a screenwriting class taught by the man who wrote this script. If only you all could read the version of this film he wrote before the studios got their cheap, dirty little hands on it. I wish I could tell you the differences without putting all his ideas out there to be stolen (yes, stolen, they were that good). I'm so sorry the original scripted version of this fell through the cracks."
5,Firestorm,"I received the product on time and it was in great shape, as advertised. I am very happy with this product and the service. I would definately buy from this seller again in the future."
1,Howie Long sucks,Howie Long should stick to football. He is an awful actor and should stay in the broadcasting business. I can't believe I wasted my money to rent this film. The action is nothing like an overtime football game. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. The action doesn't go long in this film. Anyone who liked this movie should be shot. -MNF Rules
4,GREAT MOVIE DON'T LISTEN TO THE VIEWER,"THIS IS A ACTION PACKED MOVIE WITH PLENTY OF ACTION AND GOOD ACTING IT SEEMS [...]. I CARE ABOUT PLOT IT'S GOT IT , ACTION IT'S GOT IT AND OVERALL PLOT. SOME MOVIES HOLD YOUR ATTENTION EVEN IF THE PLOT IS WEAK BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT GRABS YOU. [...] THIS COULD HAVE EASY BEEN A 4 STAR. THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH A SITE THAT NO ONE WATCHES.[...]. AGAING GREAT MOVIE. IT'S VERY EASY TO FIND ME!!! ANY TIME"
2,A disappointing offering,"I had high expectations for this disappointing book. Some of the rhymes are clumsy: """"Don't lose your keys,"" all zookeepers say. Changing locks is expensive. Key starts with the letter K."" Others are just foolish: """"X are those things animals leave everywhere. Zookeepers pick them up with the greatest of care."" While the expository text for more advanced readers is interesting, the text for the younger students leaves a lot be be desired."
4,Very informative and accurate,"Some of the rhymes may be clumsy, but speaking as an animal (zoo) keeper, this book is a real look for kids at what animal keepers really do. The illustrations are beautiful, and the information is incredibly accurate for the small ones. That's a big pet peeve for me... when books seem to consider kids too young to worry about the accuracy of scientific or animal related information.That being said, it's also geared perfectly to kids' interests without losing a spark for adults. The animal keepers I know gathered around this book with delight when it was given at a baby shower. And believe me, we are TOUGH critics on animal books."
2,Too dark,"I liked the picture, but it was too dark to see the beautiful picture and enjoy it while putting together the puzzle. The beautiful design was there, but so very faint and hidden in the darkness that it was not enjoyable."
1,"not ""The Art of Acting""","Like many acting teachers, this acting course is a self imaginations of Stanislavski's work, Her techniques are Stanislavski's but change to make her own technique, I feel the Book, misses the fundamentals of teaching a technique that really produces Great, not just good, Actors."
4,engaging characters,I found the characters engaging and the world was well built. The plot needed some tightening but I would love a sequel.
2,Railway Children - flash in the pan,"""Every beat of the heart"" is probably the only track that's good in this album. The rest are just mind-numbing repetitions of the same beat and ensemble of instruments. Don't waste your money on this album, just my personal 2 cents. So disappointed, I did not rip it to be included in my vast library of mp3 collection."
3,annoying,"It works, it has lots of functions, it's inexpensive. But it feels cheap. I bought this on short notice when I misplaced my beloved HP11C. I suppose I shouldn't expect much, but I am disappointed in1. the shallow rubber keys. Hard to be sure if you've really pressed them. Too close together. Unsatisfying feel. (Harder plastic keys as on HP11C or 12C make operations much quicker.)2. its solar power, which only works well under direct light. The calculator dims out two feet from my desk lamp. There's a button that's supposed to switch it between solar and battery, but it only seems to work half the time.3. the flimsy cheap vinyl case/sleeve.It works in standard order of operations, as opposed to reverse polish (e.g. the 11C).I haven't tried comparably-priced calculators so can't recommend an alternative except that if you're going to use a calculator routinely it's worth investing in something that feels more substantial."
4,Flashback,This calculator makes me remember tha time tha I enter in college and my father bought once like this to me
3,An easy and entertaining read,"This was the first or second World War II book that I ever read. It is ironic that Amazon requires that you be over thirteen to write a review because I was about that age when I read this book, it certainly was the first World War II book that I bought on my own. There is another irony there. I paid about a dime for it (possibly as much as a quarter) and now nearly fifty years later you can buy a copy on Amazon for about the same price. I really enjoyed the book. It is an entertaining and easy read. I remember that even then I could not determine that the characters ever existed. I knew that it was sold as nonfiction, but there was no other documentation. The story is about an Allied sailor or airman (I do not remember which) who is stranded on a Pacific island with, you guessed it, 70,000 Japanese soldiers. Since it is such an easy read I can recommend it for entertainment, but hardly as a scholarly pursuit."
1,Don't waste your money,"This product is difficult to use, and the bags and accessories are too expensive. There is nothing to retain the bag end in the vacuum channel so it's very difficult to achieve a vacuum and seal. Any moisture in the item to be sealed completley defeats the bag weld. If an item is completely dry or frozen solid the sealer works to some extent as long as the bag is considerably longer than the item to be sealed. Considering the cost of the bags and accessories, it's much cheaper to buy things in smaller quantities and use them in a reasonable amount of time. The unit I bought through Amazon and Cooking.Com was missing the accessory hose."
5,Glad I finally bought one,"You don't have to have a large family or eat a lot of meat to find plenty of uses for a FoodSaver. I bought one primarily to freeze the vegetarian casseroles that my husband I love to eat. I also wanted to take advantage of buying items in bulk without them going bad. Well, we got our FoodSaver two weeks ago, and I cannot believe the uses I've found for it. I opened the ground coffee that's been sealed in a canister for almost two weeks, and the aroma took me right back to Starbucks. I can't attest to the long-term quality of this machine, but I can certainly recommend it from a usefulness standpoint. Be sure to watch the video before you start. It contains helpful hints as well as does a super job of explaining how to operate the machine."
5,Scrumptious,"Smooth, silky, melt in you mouth candy with the refreshing tingle of peppermint. The combination of the not too sweet toothsome chocolate covering ontop of the silky filling is a winning combination."
3,Junk Food for Dogs,"Mrs. Spudman picked up a bag of this canine treat because it was on sale. I don't think Beggin Strips are much of a deal at any price. Just read the list of ingredients. It's a wheat/corn product with a little bit of bacon and cheese far down on the ingredient list. There was a time when most of the dog treat products were of this low caliber. Today there are far better choices with more wholesome ingredients and even real meat listed first.Beggin Treats are soft and easy to break into small pieces. Our dogs do seem to enjoy this offering, but in the world of dog snacks, this one resides near the bottom of my list, a treat I wouldn't consider no matter the price."
4,Beyond Stammering,Couldn't believe the last negative review of the book and the course. I attended the course last year with 27 other new students. Most of that intake have stayed with the course as the ongoing supprt is free. All have taken great strides forward although th course is not advertised as a cure. The book maybe a useful introduction but to get full benefit you need to take the course and have experts talk you through the techniques and show you how to put it into practice. I've tried most therapies in the past but this is the only one that has helped over the long term. The other reviewer blamed the costal brething for giving him a bad back but all I can say is that he nust have been doing it wrong or had a precondition.Beyond Stammering: The McGuire Programme for Getting Good at the Sport of Speaking
4,McGuire course honestly changed my life,"As a stutterer the McGuire course honestly changed my life. I've done things in the past year that I never thought I would be able to do. The book outlines the technique used to combat the core physical cause of stuttering and goes deeper into the emotional / and psychological aspects of stuttering, like overcoming anxiety and improving self-image. If you're a stutterer who is interested in the McGuire technique this book is a great resource, but in order to get the full experience, go to a course. The fee for the first course is rather sizeable and can be paid in installments, but you can go back to as many courses as you wish for only $90. It is worth it if you are a life-long stutterer. Don't take my word for it; do your own research. This book is a good place to start."
4,Kindle Version Review,"I've started reading the kindle version of ""Beyond Stammering"" as a refresher. I hope to attend another McGuire course before entering into an upcoming major transition in my life, so this book is getting me pretty excited!I'm just impressed with the layout of this kindle book. For such a niche publication, the creators of this edition have gone all out to make it readable, navigable and accessible. I especially love the function that allows you to click on an image and magnify it. I own many kindle books and this feature I admit I have never seen before.The TOC is extensive and complete, allowing me to click to virtually any part of the book (not just chapters, but sections within chapters)."
5,The search,"Very interesting, but you have to have the courage to gamble with your health. Yet if you already took a dive from a mountain top ""a la Castaneda"" you might enjoy it."
3,Valuable source material about transforming vital energy,"Yang uses Buddhist and Taoist documents, reproduced and translated section by section, to explain the esoteric training methods Yi Jin Jing and Xi Sui Jing. The first method generate qi to strengthen muscles and tendons, the second teaches Huan Jing or how to return vital energy through the spine to energize the brain. Evidently very baffled by certain aspects of these exercises, Yang sometimes has to conjecture. His translation is uncertain, yet this description includes valuable source material withheld in the popular books by Mantak Chia. This is an early work of a prolific writer who could really use an editor, and readers may find the non-standard Cantonese transliterations rather puzzling."
1,Horrible,"Horrible, Could not even fishish it! I wasted my money. I love Erotica and love romance but this was just bad!!! Do not waste your money!!!!"
3,Poor broken platter,"I received this item broken into pieces, ordered it again and received it again in pieces. It looked like the exact platter I wanted, but I gave up trying to get it in one piece. Whoever packaged it for shipping should be reprimanded as it was not protected at all."
2,"Thumbs up for Margaret Rutherford, thumbs down on everything else.","Although it is a pleasure watching Margaret Rutherford steal every scene she is in (not hard, given that the supporting players in this movie are all grade B performers), this is not a very good film...much less a good story. There are too many convenient elements that occur, too many convoluted plot and character threads, too many red herrings, and no real reason to care who did it or why. This is one of those mysteries where the viewer is not given enough information to figure it out along with the protagonist, and as a result I felt manipulated. Not recommended unless you are a big fan of Margaret Rutherford."
4,Murder Most Foul,"I have discovered Margaret Rutherford and don't even remember seeing her on TV as a child. I just love her and everything she is in. She is very, very good in this series and also The Importance of Being Ernest. Love this whole series."
5,Margaret Rutherford is wonderful!,"I didn't know if I would like this adaption of Agatha Christie's Miss Marple...but was pleasantly surprised! Very enjoyable, so I ended up purchasing the entire set on DVD."
5,Margaret Rutherford is superb,A fun and clever movie.Margaret Rutherford is the perfect Jane Marpel. I would recommend this movie to any Agatha Christie fan.
3,HARD TO ASSEMBLE,"This lamp looks great on the wall. Unfortunately, because of the poor workmanship, putting it together is difficult. The wall mount on one of the lamps wasn't straight and the swing arm wasn't lined up properly. On the other lamp,the harp that holds the shade had to be adjusted in order to get the light bulb in correctly. The shade was crooked, as well. My husband managed to fix the problems, but beware!"
3,A little disappointing. . .,"I am a HUGE fan of AIO I have collected 32 albums alone, however this one was a bit of a disappointment.For one the picture shows the new album art, but I received the old one, that is not AIO's fault, but Amazons.Second, unless it was just a defect I got, this only listed 11 episodes on the back, the twelfth on is on the discs however.Not only that I feel this is not up to the Odyssey standards, they're sort of poor and, dull. I like some of the episodes but others were a let down. I would give just about all my AIO's a five star, but I feel this only deserves a three."
1,"will carrie wind up with zhivago or stalin? oops, i must be mixing up my stories ...","an insufferable view of life among a claque of ruskie girlfriends from the late 50s to the late 70s. nothing more than ""sex & the city"" transplanted to moscow in the khruschev and brezhnev eras -- if thats your cup of borscht, more power to you!"
3,Average/below average release by KINO,"The film requires no introduction, however, the KINO ""regular"" edition (the special edition is out of print) is a bitter disappointment, moreso for the price it goes by. The subtitles are not optional (hardcoded into the mpeg) - so VERY poor DVD authoring workmanship there! Try to get the SE if possible (supposedly with extra features, and optional, multi-language subtitles.)"
4,we can look after ourselves,"The movie is fantastic until the end. It demonstrates an intelligent capable women looking after herself, bringing up her daughter and being an allround super woman. There is of course the fairy tale element... she who is good and honest and works hard succeeds, her friend who would rather win by lottery falls to ill-fortune. However, we see all charcters able to redeem themselves through changing their ways. It is the ending that is rubbish. The heroine can only find complete and true happiness by finding herself a good honest proletarian man. (Who also happens to be patriarchal and chauvanistic) She didn't need a man to achieve a happy ending. The man who she found immediately takes over the power role in her house, but at the same time is portrayed as good and wholesome. Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish... I'm all for the proletarian man, but for such a successful and capable women to allow any man to come into her life and completely take over... I don't think so!!!!!!"
5,Moscow does not believ in tears,"My second favorite Russian movie. Great, have watched it a number of times. The best way to introduce modern Russian culture to foreigners. I palied it for my Amercian friends during ""Russian Party"". I know the words by heart and before today, I had to interprete word by word the moview to non-Russian speaking people, now they can enjoy professioanl translation. Thank you"
3,Good movie,"This is one of the first foreign movies I ever saw and it is still one of my favorites. If you like foreign movies, please check this one out. It is a really good movie. The acting and the script are very believable. A Russian friend said this movie was very realistic to how the Soviet Union was for many ppl."
5,Oscar winner,a real classic russian movie! make you smile millions time!!! just watch and enjoy a play of good actors and script!
1,Don't order from Scamazon,"I'll be amazed if this review gets posted. We ordered it in August 2006. Two months later, we're still waiting for it to arrive. We chose standard shipping...which must mean a slow boat from China. Every few weeks we get an email pushing back the shipping date. Why would overnight shipping be offered on a product they can't get their hands on for two months not two days? Check the website, they'll still offering expedited shipping, yet no product for two months. A nice fellow on the customer service website placed the blame on Activision. Funny, Walmart and Toys R Us have no problem getting it in stock. I would have given this game the goose egg in terms of starts but the system would not let me, so we give one star as a lifetime achievement award."
4,A More Raw Paulson,"I picked up ""Variations"" after devouring Paulson's second LP ""All At Once."" This record, while amazing in it's own right, I think is a little over-shadowed by the bands follow up record. ""Variations"" starts of with an instrumental piece that gives a sense of a great build up, but to me it seems to not deliver on that end as if the whole song is build up. But then the album really kicks in with ""A Great Pretending,"" a tune with somewhat somber verses (but listen to their drummer!) and a really driving chorus. The next two songs ""Convertible"" and ""Nightfall"" keep the pace going. The middle of the album is a bit slow to me and doesn't pick up to the same level as the earlier songs until ""Feast Or Famine"" and the closing track ""Convertible (reprise)."""
5,No sugar grape flavored sparkling H2O,"I love stevia. I no longer drink sodas not even diet sodas. I use stevia at home, at work and even when I go out to eat. In resturants I order sparkling water or soda water and add stevia drops to create healthy bubbly drinks. Using the grape flavor reminds me of when I was a kid. It is wonderful!! I use Stevia to sweeten everything."
5,My own flavored water,I do not like drinking flavored water with aspertame in it so I ordered the Grape Stevia. Added it to my water and got it to the consistency I like and it was delicious.
4,Another Excellent Product,"This is the third flavored stevia I have tried from this company and it is as excellent as the previous two. The aroma is excellent, however the flavor is mild. I have yet to find a flavored stevia that is both good tasting AND highly flavored."
5,grape tootsie pop,I mix this with the chocolate flavor and put it in my carbonated water. It tastes like I'm drinking a grape tootsie pop.
2,too weak,"Grape Flavor is too weak and the Stevia is too sweet.I buy this brand of unflavored Stevia and I like it a lot, but this isn't a very good product.If you could add some more Grape Flavor it would work for me"
2,stevia,was not happy with this product. the flavor changed rather dramaticly after being mixed with bottled water and stored in a refrigirator for use the next day
1,"Great idea, poor execution","These Sweetleaf ""flavored"" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution."
2,ANGELITO ?,I Don't Know If This is The Song I have Loved Since I was a kid ?I would Like to get a Audio Clip to Hear if it is ?
5,Extraordinary Voice,"This is an album that people will love or hate. Mandy Patinkin's voice is very unusual... does he sing falsetto, or tenor or is he a baritone? Perhaps he is all of this - a singer with a huge range. If you are expecting something predictable, you'll be disappointed.As the title says, Mandy experiments with this album, in ways that are reminiscent of Streisand in the 70s. The results are exciting and surprising.This is the album that I listen to whilst driving long distances. The variety keeps me alert and eagerly anticipating the next track. This is, I think, Mandy Patinkin's greatest album. I love it."
1,My Kingdom For Some Earplugs!!!,"Atrocious. Patinkin does a remarkable impression of a castrato being slow-tortured with a powerdrill. Self-indulgent, vulgar, pretentious, and without an ounce of evident talent. Put this on at the very end of a party to make those unwanted stragglers run screaming from the premises."
1,Torture,"So I thought I'd give this another listen, just to see if it was as bad as I thought it was originally.Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was orignally.IT WAS EVEN WORSE!!Patinkin's ghastly braying is the foulest noise yet to assault the human ear. He makes gangsta rap sound downright soothing. I will never listen to this crap again."
4,Still wonderful voice although the cd lacks a little vigor,"Mandy Pitinkin has an extremely original voice. I was shocked when I found out that the man whose name I remembered usually as 'Inigo Montoya'(from his role in ""The Princess Bride"") could sing! My friend had his cd ""The Secret Garden"" and he was just amazing in it! Especially ""Lily's Eyes'! His fire and passion in the song was magnificent so naturally I have wanted to hear other cd's (after I bought the Secret Garden, of course). This one was very good. Soothing, and with his highy recognizable tenor falsetto voice. I can't quite give it five stars because it is, as I said, very mellow, but if you want a mellow cd- this is it! (By the way, I have very little trouble remembering his real name anymore! :])"
4,from a reader's point of view,"This book deals with the issues teens are faced with growing up within a mythical, gripping setting. This book riveted me with the realistic choices and the problems that the main characters were faced with. And I loved the way the characters were strong minded and grew more mature as the plot thickened."
4,Chillin' With Illin' in Philly,"Ok, Tommy Davidson is so funny and this comedy show helps convey the wild side of him. He is so good at making someone laugh. I cry with laughter each time I watch this video. I think that if you have never seen Tommy in standup, then this will be the perfect first choice."
5,Perfect!,I purchased this bed for my min pin who is always hinding under blankets. She loves it! Almost immediately she was curled up fast asleep. I even had to buy a second one to keep my other min from kicking her out. They both couldn't be happier. Great product!
4,The next best thing if they can't be under the covers next to you,"My 6 pound long haired, miniature dachsund loves to crawl under the hood of this bed. Her first choice, is of course, to be under the bed covers and pressed up against me. But, if you have to sometimes be out of your bed and away from your pet, this is a nice alternative. It won't close completely over them like covers will, but they can burrow under the hood and have some warmth and privacy a regular bed won't allow."
4,"Perfect for my dog, almost perfect for me","Sprocket loves this bed. She curls up on it, sprawls across it, digs at it, and, of course, sleeps on it. She likes to get under covers and likes to ""dig"" at her bed to make it cozier. She had one just like it previous to this, but it needed replacing.I looked all over for this bed that was at a great price and I found it. My quibble with it is that the padding on the base of the bed is thinner than I'd like it to be (although it doesn't seem to bother her) and when she digs in it, it sometimes moves across the floor. If I had to buy it again, I might buy the more expensive deluxe bed.Nevertheless, it's great. She loves it and I love to see her in it. I absolutely recommend it."
2,"25"" before assembled?","The interior space is less than 11""..... I guess when they gave the size they meant the fabric before it was sown together.... there is no way my 40 lb terrier get fit in there...It is well made just very untruthful about the sizing in their ad... I am saving it to re-gift for Xmas to someone with a cat....."
4,"Great bed, but wears out quickly","This bed is great for any dog that loves to burrow under the sheets in your bed. Without this thing i'm not sure we would have been able to ever convince our dog to stop begging and crying to get under the sheets. He can hop in, lay down, and stay warm.My one and only issue with this is that the stuffing inside of it is pretty lack luster and he had worn it out to a flat state within a month or so. Luckily this is easily remedied with a trip to the craft store back to Amazon for some stuffing. We unzipped it, stuffed it back full with more fluff, and the dog was back on cloud 9."
5,Just right,"We had been looking for a good bed for our 23 lb beagle for a while, and had a little trepidation about trying this one based just on the product photo and reviews (given that reviewers use them for a variety of pets.). I thought he would not want to use it or it would be too small.It's actually just the right size for him if he curls up (too small to stretch out on), and he used it right off the bat. The pillow makes it usable on any floor surface, and the pocket allows him to snuggle in on chilly days. Also, it's not unwieldy like other beds we've seen, which is nice for us because we some times need to toss it into the car when we travel."
1,Full of Nothin,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. The bed does not have nearly enough filling in it. I have ceramic tile and when my dachshund goes into it she sinks to the floor. No, she is not one of those grossly overweight ones that you see waddling around town. LOL I guess if you have padded carpeting then the bed would be fine but if you are planning on using this bed on hard surfaces then I don't recommend it."
3,Shih Tzu doesn't like it,"The opening is too small - the cover is attached nearly 3/4 the way around, which only leaves a small entry. Thought my Shih Tzu would like, but she never slept in it. She only got treats and toys I hid in it. My mistake - she's a nester, not a burrower (never burrows under covers). She sleeps in a nesting bed, similar to this one,Slumber Pet Dimple Plush Nesting Bed 18 In Pink, where she curls up next to the sides.Update - gave bed to the neighbor's puppy dachshund. He LOVES it! He doesn't have to sleep in his crate anymore! Yay!"
3,"Bed kinda sags, didn't happen to be a hit for my cat","as mentioned in other reviews the hood does not stay up by itself. learn if that is something your pet likes (do they hide under covers or do they prefer to be in shelters). if they don't like being under covers it's going to be hard to convince them this is for them. in addition, the bed kinda sags when the pet gets in, in my opinion making it an even harder sell for the pet."
3,Not for all dogs,I bought this for my toy poodle and he refused to get into it. Even though he loves to burrow under the covers with my husband and me he wanted nothing to do with the bed. Make sure your dog is a true burrowing dog before buying it.
2,Not Exactly What Is Pictured,"1. I bought this bed totally because of the hood, which is shown standing up on its own. The only problem is that it does not stand up on its own. My two little dogs lie on top of the whole thing with the hood folded under them. If I had known this, I never would have bought it.Obviously if your pet (like mine) does not burrow, this bed will not fulfil its advertised function.2. A second issue is the fleece, which is cheap and sheds easily. After only 3 days of use, the bed is covered all over with tiny bits of it.If my pooches learn to burrow, I will follow up with a review of the bed's durability and washability. (In the meantime, anyone know how to teach a dog to burrow?)"
3,burrow bed,The bed is not exactly what I was looking for but it is quite nice. I was disappointed with Amazon though because of the length of time it took it to arrive and the box it came in looked like it had been in a train wreck. One of the slips of the packing information had even slipped out of the box and torn off so it was not legible.... I will really have to think before I order through Amazon again.
3,Good but too small,I was excited to find this bed. My Westie (12lbs) loves to sleep under the covers and burrow. The quality was very good but the fabric on top was too small. He could not burrow in the bed because the fabric wouldn't even cover his head. I returned the item disappointed.
4,Comfy Pet Bed,This bed is very soft and comfy for my animals. It cuddles them and that is what they like.
5,happy kids,My Jack Russells have a similar bed that has been used constantly. They are burrowers by nature. I ordered two of these beds and am very pleased. May order two more to keep on hand. I would recommend this bed for anyone with a terrier or any small dog actually. My cats are also enjoying these beds. I may get to actually sit in my recliner without all five Jacks!
3,Cuddly and soft but hard to wash,"The Pet Mate Burrow Bed is cuddly, soft and lightweight. My only problem with it is that the cover doesn't come off for washing, and the whole bed is too big to put in my washing machine. The fleece on the inside is a fabric that I know will collect pet fur like mad, and since my cat sheds heavily, if I can't wash the bed regularly it will be disgusting in no more than a week. If you have a pet that doesn't shed, then this bed would be great."
4,great product for dogs that like to hide and sleep,"this product was perfect for a small miniture pincher that liked to hide in a small space when it would go to sleep. It kept it warm, and it liked to sleep inside it with just its nose peeking out."
2,Not durable: my dog ripped it to shreds,"This pet bed was pretty good quality from what I could tell when I first got it. The size was perfect for a smaller dog. I have a chihuahua mix and it's slightly too big for him.However, the real test came when I let him sleep in it. He figured out how to use it in no time, but my little beast likes to play with his beds too. The bed didn't last a week before he ripped it to shreds. Most of the filling is out and the zippers were ripped off (which is a nice feature). This might be a great bed for a gentle dog, but not for one that likes to rip things apart.I just wish this bed was more durable. It feels like a waste of money and would not purchase again; at least for my dog. It might work for yours."
4,my chihuahua loves it,"I have a dog who likes to sleep in a dark and covered place, this bed really does the trick...i saw this at the store and decided to buy it...it was worth the moneyonly flaw is that your have to adjust the cover to your dog's or cat's liking.the cushion is soft and plush"
2,Cheaply made compared to the Snoozer Cozy Cave,I bought this and my terrier loves it. It does have some issues. The piling from the fleece ends up all over. It's a bit smaller than advertised and the flap above it doesn't cover much. I was thinking about buying another one since my cats like to also try to cram in there with the dog. Since they didn't have a large in this item I found the Snoozer Cozy Cave which also comes in large and xlarge. Night and day in quality and durability. The top flap covers more and it has a plastic insert across it that keeps the flap in place. This one can be washed in the wash machine unlike the Petmate. It's expensive on Amazon but I found the LARGE for 59.00 including handling from Drs. Foster & Smith. Well worth every penny. The dog and both cats can easily fit in it.
4,"Nice Dog Bed, If A Bit Smaller Than I thought","Like this dog bed, well-constructed and very sturdy. Will be a warm snuggly bed. I guess I didn't really appreciate the size though. I have 2 Italian Greyhound puppies, 4 months old. Thought it would accommodate both easily, but it barely does. The 25-inches is outside diameter--not inside sleeping area. Good thing they usually sleep wrapped around each other. It will do for the present, during these cold winter months, until they outgrow it.I'm very unhappy with FedEx right now. This was Amazon Prime, ordered & shipped 11/26 (a Friday) for delivery 11/30 (a Tuesday) in Denver, Co. FedEx somehow mis-delivered it to St Paul, MN, then finally re-routed it and delivered on 12/3 (Friday, one week after ordering). They never admitted any error, just kept telling me it was ""in transit and on time."" Hah!"
4,A little too small,I bought this for my 20-lb dog and it's a bit too small for her. She likes it very much but when she sleeps in it her head is hanging on the floor. I had read that this size was good for up to 25 lb but this didn't work for my dog.
3,Size is SMALLER than you may think,"My 22 pound dog does not fit inside the inner area of the bed. He still sleeps on top of it, but burrowing is out for him. I think the 25 inch claim is misleading. This would be great for a very small dog, however."
2,Not worthy of your money,"This bed seemed great at first. My doggie is 12lbs and walked right in. She seemed happy but had a problem staying in the bed. Her problem was getting comfortable in it and she seemed to slip off the center of the bed into the edge between the padded portion and the hood. I tried and tried to help her get back up onto the bed, but she just kept slipping back down. Needless to say the bed is in the closet, and her new bed ($9.99 at CVS Pharmacy,just down the street) is in it's place. She loves it and has no trouble sleeping now. Sorry I bought this bed and hope you don't have the same problem if you buy it."
3,Dog Bed Is OKAY. IT DOES WORK FOR SMALL DOGS,I WOULD LIKE TO REVISE MY REVIEW. AFTER HAVING THIS BED FOR AWHILE I STARTED NOTICING THAT MY DOG DOES LIKE IT. ESPECIALLY MY LITTLE CHIHUAHUA. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BED FOR SMALL DOGS DEFINITELY. BUT WATCH FOR THEM EATING THE FUR. THAT DOES HAPPEN AND THE FLAP DOES NOT STAY UP THAT WELL.I would not recommend this dog bed. It is not made of good quality. My little dog eats the fluff in it and won't get in it. It's too high to step in and it rocks from side to side. They do not want to burrow in it at all. It is not cozy and my pets just don't like it. I cannot return a dog bed for sanitary reasons but buyer beware. My animals did not take to it and I have a 4 pound dog that DOES NOT EVEN LIKE THIS BED. Sorry but don't buy. Get one that is flatter and does not have that overlap on it. That is a waste. It simply does not work right like it is described. I wish I had gotten another one instead.
2,Got flat and lumpy within a month!,Got this bed for my little minpin who loves to burrow. Was great at first but within a months time was lumpy and uneven and substantially less fluffy. I would say that there was not enough fill in this bed and what was there was of poor quality. Bought a new bed a costco that is holding up great!
2,Burrow Pet Bed,"This bed looks as pictured, but is for a smaller dog (less than 12/13 lbs. My dog is a 19 lb. rat terrier and barely fits inside. She loves to burrow, but not inside this bed. I think the padding could be better also."
2,"Okay quality, cats have no interest in it","My cats love burrowing, love sitting on fabric of mine, but they have zero interest in this. I can't complain much about the quality, but I can't give it the same rating as something they love playing with (like their cat tree or scratching post). One thing I thought could be better was more room to burrow in. With all the fluffing materials in the bottom and size of the cover, there didn't seem much room to nuzzle inside, they preferred the cavernous grocery paper bags. This ended up being a waste of space that I gave away for free."
5,Mini dogs and any cat will love this,"We purchased this for our cat, but our dog found it first. The top is really pliable, and acts as a blanket. Our dog (about 10 lbs) spends all of his free time in this thing. He is teething, and the fabric is holding up to all his chewing. It's nice and plump. He's comfortable on it both indoors and out, including when we place it on hard surfaces.The top is soft enough for our pup to sleep on top of the flap, but he also likes to go under the flap and use the flap as a blanket.This was purchased for $16. At that price it is a total bargain. I would not pay more than $35 for it though."
4,J-Hop put in style,"This album finally makes music speak words as much as the poets and and singers on here do themselves. This was a album that comes together and puts another piece to the music world, not like bands who frantically make albums. This album was composed by Ikey Owens the aw inspiring keyboardist of sublime, long beach dub allstars, mars volta and those are just a few. Hip hop jazz in a way with experimentation every track has this face to it, and it slowly shows it self every song reveals hope happiness and inspiration. This album will get it's notice no doubt about it. If you like good music and thats a bold statement I'm putting out there because if you really like good music then this album is all good."
2,Unhappy,"I thought this was a Electronic Organizer, but it turned out to be a Momo Master Alarm...........I kept and have been able to use it although difficult for my use.The product is fine........just not what I expected or wanted"
3,I'm Judging This Drink Without Nostalgia,"First off, I'd like to say that I'm judging this drink without nostalgia. I never grew up with it and I'm basing is purely on its taste. So, how does it taste? Well, it is a peculiar drink. It feels thicker on your tongue than most sodas, and is a bit sweeter (although not overly sweet), and it has a strong pear flavor. Also the amount of fizz is not what you would find in a Coca-Cola, but it has a good enough amount. If you like the taste of pears, then I would definitely recommend this. What you think depends on how much you like the fruit. I'm not a gigantic pear fan myself, so you should keep that in mind."
2,needs to much work,"like the gentleman said in previous review you can make it better with work. mine leaked bad when i got it, unusable. so i patched the seams with furnace cement, helped a lot but you still get smoke from openings , if you want to work on those areas as well maybe you could get it to stop leaking smoke. after all the sealing i did, i put out the lights and shined a flash light in the room and there was a haze of smoke all through the room. it seems to eat wood quit a bit also all and all there are too many problems with it and i don't consider something a good product if you have to do so much work to it just to be able to put up with it. if you can get it for a couple hundred bucks it may be worth it to put in a work shed or area outside. don't waste your money on this one."
4,Key German Memoir,"'With the German Guns' is the English version of a book originally published in German. It has the major strength that few other memoirs by German soldiers of the period are availiable in English. It contains fascinating passages describing bombardments (from the perspective of those doing the shooting !) Its coverage may be criticised as uneven - but then as an accurate memoir of real war service this is almost inevitable. A 'top twenty' book for anyone interested in WW1 memoirs, or the German army of 1914-1918."
5,insight into despair,Fascinating account of the German soldier who stood firm throughout the war only to find that his nation had crumbled behind the front. Even at the war's end he had been able to travel to travel by train to see his parents while his unit was still in France and Belgium slowly retreating toward their Seigfried Line. His attitudes toward the righteousness of the German cause are clearly expressed as is his confidence in ultimate victory. Defeat came hard.
4,Easily Readable in a Day,"This book provides a window into the experiences of a German artillery soldier that took part in many of the largest battles on the Western Front in WWI. The stories which the author shares, particularly those about his trips on leave, provide the reader with a look at the impact the war had on those people still living in Germany.As the war ends the book sheds light on how there were many German soldiers that still believed in the fight they were fighting, although they must have known they were beaten. The author effectively transmits his sadness at the end of the war. One of the other aspects of this book that I liked was that it appeared the author did not write the diary with the intention of having the document published; this gave the book more of a real feeling."
2,Great Period 70's Look- Or Shoddy film making?,"The trailer for this film is on IMDB.The film was shot nearby my home in Schenectady NY.There was no budget for this, they asked extras to bring their own original 70's clothes and hired people who had them.It by-passed theaters and is going straight to DVD and the Lifetime movie network...The shoddy work seen in the trailer makes it look like it was actually shot on Super 8 film in the 70's.."
3,SOGGY SERIAL,PROS:*Good cinematography*Thora Birch's performance*Keith Carradine*Dean Winters' slimy pimpCONS:*Awkward pacing*Muddled ending*Opening reveals the verdict which sabotages suspenseSUMMARY: Average biopic with little suspense or thrills buoyed by Birch's portrayal
1,Winter of Frozen Dreams Movie,"The acting in this movie was good. Keith Carradine and Thora Birch are experienced actors and did an admirable job despite a deplorable screenplay. I was in Madison when the ""drama"" for this play was unfolding. I have read the book. There is so much that could have been done with this story, but the movie never focuses on anything. It is like a movie version of Cliff's Notes."" It ""covers the bases,"" but never gets into the character's heads much, especially Birch's character, Barbara Hoffman. That is where the interest of this story lies. But again, all we see is a flat portrayl of a complex character. Again, the fault is in the screenplay and directing, not the acting."
3,Waste Management...,"I love Thora Birch (DARK CORNERS, THE HOLE). However, her talents are mostly wasted in WINTER OF FROZEN DREAMS. It starts out fine, w/ a murder and the ensuing cover-up. Unfortunately, things bog down in a big way, leaving Thora w/ little to do as the (rather bizarre) Barbara Hoffman. Keith Carradine's cop-near-retirement character isn't all that exciting, but then no one in this movie is very dynamic! I actually drifted into dreamland a few times, something I NEVER do when Ms. Birch is on screen! Alas, I re-watched it and found that I hadn't missed a thing... P.S.- Don't even get me started on the mega-whimp played by Brendan Sexton III! His character was so spineless I could barely watch him! Ugh..."
2,Winter of Frozen Dreams,"Movie was O.K.I knew Barbara.She was beautiful, smart, and came from a wonderful family.Read the book.It was better"
1,Batteries Are Impossible To Find,"This is a cute little book, but as-soon-as the battery runs out, it's impossible to find one to replace it. And they are expensive to replace. NOT worth the cost."
5,Love Bug Books,"Have this book for my granddaughters. Bought two more for gifts. It is too cute. Perfect for baby shower, new arrival or toddler. My 6 year old granddaughter likes to read it to her little sister as the words are so fun. Sweet story, as well as, music and lights. Features include on/off switch and, a place for baby's photo, to personalize."
3,Scratched & Scarred,"For a new book, the cover was very scratched and scarred. It's a gift & it looks used. Other items from this same vendorwere great, but on this one I was disappointed!"
4,Love Bug,"So, nowhere in the reviews I read before buying this book did I learn of it's religious nature. At the end of the book it says you're god's best gift or something to that effect. I was stunned and dismayed as I was reading it aloud to my 2 year old son. He loves the book of course b/c of the music it plays when you open the book. The music ends about half way thru reading the book. If you close the book enough as you turn the pages, you can get the music to start again so it plays for the rest of the read."
1,Cringe Inducing,"This book is difficult to read. It is written in embarrassingly cutesy language that is demeaning for both parent and child. The first time I read the book I was stunned at how lame it was. The words will sound insincere if you don't typically speak in the most grating, annoying, infantile baby talk on a constant basis. I put the book on the shelf for many months and then last night started reading it to my son again, I got to the third page and had to stop. There are so many great children's books and books for babies out there, please avoid this cringe inducing, syrupy sweet catastrophe."
4,"Loved the Book, but misleading about the batteries","I read this to my granddaughter every time I was with her, which was quite frequently. Slowly the batteries died, so I went to the site given on the back of the book only to get a list of sites offering the batteries at cost. It clearly says, ""Free Replacement Batteries."" Very disappointed in the promise that is not kept by the publisher. Did buy another new copy, as it is that good."
4,You're My Little Love Bug,"We love the book. We've purchased it before for another grandchild. However, the music in this book does not begin until the second page is turned, or at least lifted. This did not seem to be the case with the book we bought earlier.Perhaps a small thing, but a bit of a frustration.MJ"
5,You're My Little Love Bug,This has to be the best book for children. Our grandchildren are in love with this one. All of Heidi Weimer's books are loving and reassuring to small children. They also have lights and sound (thanks to button batteries) which also serve to entertain. I think we now have all of her light and sound books (board books).
5,My son loves this book!!!,The sweet music and thick cardboard pages are perfect for kids. My son Matthew always perks up and smiles when this book is opened. We have even used it to cheer him up during vaccinations and haircuts. Great book.
5,HIGHLY Recommend! My little one's favorite!,"This is the BEST little kids book....it is short enough to keep their attention and the music and lights also are very entertaining. My little girl is only 3 months old, but she just stares at the pages as I read. Great Story! I will be buying many more of these for friends."
5,Great book!!!!!!,"This is a sweet, fun book that children of all ages will like. My 8 month old nephew likes it because of the lights and sounds, and a friend's 6 year old likes it because of the silly rhymes. I have purchased 4 for various children now. Recommended for everyone!!!!!"
4,great service,Great service but book was a little beat up and battery did not last more than a month.
4,"Fun, but the original still better","People refer to the ""piano"" version as if Bach wrote this for the piano, rather than the harpsichord. This string version is very nicely done, but it loses the crispness and velocity of attack that is only possible with a solo instrument, whether in the original harpsichord or piano version. It gains something in sonority and the mellowness of the string sound. But in the end, Bach wrote this for a keyboard instrument, and to suggest that the piece would sound equally good in an orchestra transcription would imply that Bach was not really thinking about what he was doing in the first place, when he wrote it for the harpsichord. No, he was taking full advantage of the potentiality in the harpsichord. And while a piano transcription deviates from that, it is still a solo keyboard.This string version is a nice one to add to one's Bach library, but it will never replace either the harpsichord or piano versions."
2,Not what I expected,I have been a long time house music lover all the way back in the days of Chicago. This was a devastating disappointment. The result didn't match the intention in this project. Very cheaply done. :-(
2,A Girl Thing,"The performances in this movie were pretty good, which saves it, but the script and direction...oh honey! This film was so obviously done by men who really wish they could get into women's heads, but just can't. The most glaring example was the relationship between the women. I'm a lesbian and during the love scenes I just couldn't figure out what they were supposed to be doing. That might be because no one involved in making the film, including the actresses, had a single clue of what women do in bed. Not that it had to be explicit, that would just be gross, but the implication of what they were doing made no sense."
5,A Girl Thing,"The entire DVD is good. The lesbian component was sensitive, emotional and romantic. The lesbian love scenes were incredible. I would love to see a sequel to the lesbian part."
2,Old not very up to date,I am sure that this was racy for it day but it not much by todays standards. Try lip service or the L word they are much better.
5,Wonderful movie,"I really liked this movie, its got a wonderful cast of women in it. The ending was a suprise as well."
3,"Not the best acting, BUT...","...the scenes with Kate Capshaw and Elle Macpherson are SIZZLING!! Stockard Channing is always wonderful, and has obviously waited it out to ""come of age"" and into the roles of her career. Cameryn Manheim and and a few of the other actresses were really fun to see outside of the familiar roles we are used to. I'd recommend ""Things You Can Tell Just By Looking At Her"" if you like this ""vignette"" format...it's a little better."
4,Sophisticated and engaging,"Star-studded and thought-provoking; we expect great things from Stockard Channing and Mia Farrow and Camryn Manheim, and I've long been a fan of Kate Capshaw, but who knew she could be so convincing and so....,well,..hot in this role. I blush to think of the love scenes. Amazingly sensual and beautifully acted and filmed. And the Joni Mitchell score was a perfect complement. I really enjoyed parts II and IV, too, but, Lordy, those love scenes..."
4,Great dialogue and superb acting too!!!,"I stumbled to this movie on Lifetime, love it. Then I ran out and rent the DVD, love it even more.The script writer had done a wonderful job. The first story captures me and the last one just wrap it up incredibly. I denfinetly would buy the sequel to the first story."
5,Obscure sensation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This band was very popular in the early '90s among the college students. It took forever for me to find the cd & it is one of my faves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Set Sails Free is by far the best song of theirs. I was finally able to get this on my Ipod. Prior to finding it; I always went on youtube to listen to it. Amazon is a fantastic way to find obscure items!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,A terrible mastering job!,"If you are thinking of buying this CD because you believe it to be remastered then don't do it! While nowhere on the packaging does it claim to be remastered the sound is definitely a letdown. Especially, on ""Jamboree"", the sound is muddled and sounds like it came from a 10th-generation master tape. My clean vinyl record sounds a lot better than this CD. ""Walking in the Shadow..."" sounds a bit better than ""Jamboree"" but if that is the main reason you want this CD then try for Rhino's REMASTERED version of ""Walking"", because it sounds great. I am hoping that Rhino is considering remastering ""Jamboree"" because this version just plain stinks!"
4,"Great deal, but not the best sound quality","I'm sure I have plenty of discs in my collection that don't sound much better than this, but it's still a bit of a disappointment after all this time that ""Jamboree"" sounds average at best. Quite frankly, I'm not going to complain too loudly since I waited over 15 years to have ""Jamboree"" on CD. Getting both of these recordings on one disc is a very good deal, but I docked it a star for the sound and even a couple of obvious mistakes in the liner notes (Marietta is a suburb of Athens? Think I might move to Marietta then!).When this twofer came out on CD I was about to run out and buy it and then noticed on the GD website that ""Jamboree"" would soon get the makeover treatment that ""Walking... "" got from Rhino. I'm tired of waiting for that to happen, so I purchased this pup even though I already owned the first pressing of ""Walking..."". ""Jamboree"" is THAT good of a recording that I really had to have it in my collection."
2,Disappointed,I expected to receive a good quality throw. It is quite thin and cheap looking. It certainly is not worth the price.
4,You have planted your garden; now what?,"Janet Macunovich has provided a very detailed account of what to do after you have planted your perennial garden. It is very informative as we follow her tending an actual perennial garden; a great concept. Mistakes and all, we see the problems, challenges, and joys of perennial gardening the way most of us do it. From early spring cleanup, to plant division, to weeding, plant choice and more, this is an excellent book for those who have a perennial garden, or those who are considering one. No punches pulled; highly recommended. Why four stars? I live in Arizona; if the book was written for desert gardens, five stars. (I know, I know...)Bob Burke"
3,Good resource,"This book is a good resource book. The author makes it interesting, and takes you through her garden in a great way. Although I think it is a great resource book, it would have been much better for me, if it had been written more under the plant's common name, as opposed to the scientific names. That is kind of rough for beginners looking for info on how to care for certain plants, but still inexperienced at scientific species..."
1,"Review of "" Perennials: What to Do..... etc","Caring for perennials is often a gardening area that many people either avoid or misunderstand . Just because a plant is "" scheduled "" to re-appear for another year, there ARE certain conditions which should be provided for plants to ensure that event. This book clearly and concisely, does that. It assists both novices and master gardeners with wonderful information. Highly recommended for ANY gardener or level of ability. Carl Kokes- Peru, New York ( very northern NY State)"
2,Not the best,"I am a Master Gardener- have gardened for 20 years.I just thought I would check this out, for new techniques.Dont waste your money""The Flower Gardener's Bible"" is alot better and more indepth.Conclusion: If you have never had a flower bed- or delt with leaf blite- then this may be the book for you."
5,Not a six pack!,"Note the ""6-pack"" at the end of the description - THIS IS AN ERROR! This bulb will ship one at a time. It's a good bulb, but it ain't a ""6-pack."""
1,Cannot hook it up because Amazon doesn't carry cables,"This product requires special cables. Not only are they not included, but Amazon doesn't tell you 1) they don't carry them and 2) apparently they are not obtainable in the U. S. So right now I have an expensive paperweight and nothing else."
3,I might have gotten a bad pair,"I have the Extreme version of these. They are good, with a fantastic field of vision but I have a distortion in the lower outside corners of both lenses that I find very distracting. I also have the Nikon 7 X 50 Action Extreme and can't imagine how I'd be happier with them other than the front lens cap issue mentioned by others, so I know it's not all Nikons. My wife notices the distortion also and she prefers the 7 X 50's. I suggest trying before buying if possible. Another pair may not have the distortion or it may not bother you.Other than that, the filed of vision makes them very good for birding or other action-packed viewing.If you decide to get these, consider the Action Extreme if you will be using these in harsh conditions. Also, check the chart on the ""Nikon Action 7x50 EX Extreme ATB Binocular"" page to choose the right size for your needs. It applies to both the Action and Action Extreme models."
5,High quality,"The binoculars cost a little more than some of the off brands, but I figured that Nikon would know how to a quality product. Images are razor sharp."
2,Not worth the $$$$$,"I received these as a christmas gift from my wife. While the quality seemed good, I was not impressed on the zoom. These binoculars are for viewing things. such as a bird right in front of you, not at a ballgame or event where you are trying to see further out. I bought an $18 pair of bushels 12x25 right here on amazon for my kids to use. They are a 1/3 of this price and completely blow the nikons out of the water with the zoom and clarity. I would not recommend this item for people who are wanting to see things that are more than 25 yards in front of them. They simply don't have the magnification power for that."
4,Nikon wide-angle 7x35 action binocs very good deal,"The optics are excellent. I found viewing excellent, ranging from viewing stars and Jupiter and the Moon to birds in the woods. The only slightly irritating aspect is that, while there is a strap for the binocs, there is no strap for the case. I found myself accidentally dropping the case when taking the binoculars out, assuming the case was attached to something.On the whole, this was an excellent purchase. RC"
4,"Nice binoculars, but don't lose the lens cap!","We bought these binoculars for a trip to Alaska. They are fairly compact and lightweight, which made them perfect for viewing wildlife and scenery while backpacking. My only complaint is that we lost one of the objective lens caps, and it has been pretty much impossible to replace it. Nikon says that part has been backordered for 7 months, and I can't find any dealers who sell it. It seems crazy, especially after reading the other reviewer's comment about how easy it is to lose the cap.... we must not be the only ones with this problem."
4,"Nikon binocular good, but not great.","I bought these binoculars to replace a cheap pair that I had used for years. The new ones are very good, but not that much better than the old cheap pair I had. I thought there would be a much greater differance."
3,Angry Giraffe???,"I bought this for my 18 month old as a potential Christmas present. I think I am going to hold onto it for a bit due to the giraffe looking a little angry. In the picture the giraffe looks as though its eyes are 2/3 of the way open which is a little ""off"" looking as it is. In Actuality the eyelids are angled sharply toward the nose literally making the puppet look angry...I also ordered the puppy and the monkey. Both of which are super cute. All of their eyes are very securely attached so no worries for a mouthy toddler. Additionally, the material is very soft making for very inviting hugs! Definitely recommend if you have a child who likes puppets!"
3,Cute but not great,This was cute and it's a puppet so it's not like it has to be amazing but the mouth is a little stiff and hard to mainpulate. The eyes look a bit weird too but my son gets a kick out of it so that's what counts.
5,Very cute,My grand daughter is into puppets. We got this as an entry level puppet. It is easy to use for smaller hands.
2,Rotated eyes make this puppet ANGRY looking,"In general, the puppet I received is nice - large enough to put my hand into (and I have larger hands than most) and seems durable and well constructed. One things ruins the whole puppet though. Whereas the eyes in the picture on the Amazon page are horizontally oriented making the puppet look friendly, the eyes on the one we received are vertically oriented, making the puppet look ANGRY! We actually named the puppet ""Scary"" due to its eye situation. Not sure why the difference in manufacturing, but I'm hesitant to use it with my baby, lest she get an unwarranted fear of angry giraffes."
5,Aurora Plush Hand Puppets are Great!,My grandchildren have favorite animals so it was really nice to find these hand puppets in so many different animal styles. They are sturdy and soft/fuzzy and very nice for young ones to play with.
1,Don't know much about 50 states,"I have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:Washington is the Evergreen State, not the ""CHINOOK State"", Mt.St. Helens did not have ""LAVA"" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the Chinook winds are a ""PAIR of winds"" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. As a native of Washington, I began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. After reading the section I did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as I knew that I certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal."
2,Fluff and animation...,"... but very little real information. At 65 pages of large print and sprawling cartoons, rather devoid of anything exceptional.I'd skip it and find something more informative for your child."
3,Don't Know Much About the 50 States,I have found this book to be an excellent way to introduce ESL students to a study of the United States.......it gives them (students) a chance to tell more of what they know about the states and also an opportunity to become somewhat knowledgeable about the history of this country. They were surprised that the people called Americans came(immigrated legally and illegally)to this country. They were very surprised to know that the Native Americans owned the land.I would have liked the book to have had some type of evaluation (test) and reference guide to accompany this book.
2,I STILL don't know that much...,"Granted... this is a book for 9 to 12 year olds and I'm 28, but I still expected more than I got. In my quest for easy knowledge I picked up this little book hoping to get a quick overview of the different states. Like pointed out in previous reviews, I got a lot of fluff and not that much content. The information for some states was so trivial that it sounded like a joke. I guess I will have to wait for the guys from the ""Everything You Need to Know About..."" collection to do one about the 50 states.:)"
1,Waste of time.,"Reading this book put me in a thorny place (everyone who has read the book will understand this). My book club read this book and we all disliked it.From a promising beginning, the book could have been so much more than it was. I was disappointed in the cardboard portrayal of the characters who each had a catharsis that left me thinking ""yeah - and your point is..."" I guess I felt that the characters were not adequately developed - so that the reader couldn't really care about them, their lives, or their future.The premise of the book was great, the writing wasn't too bad, yet the reality of the story rated a C- at best."
1,A poor man's Phil Collins!,"True to say that Paul Carrack is a bit of a nothing artist. One of those musicians who supposedly has a great voice but just flits from band to band because he thinks that band is desperate to use his ""great voice"". Poor Squeeze, Ace and Mike and the Mechanics. I suppose his equilvant in the US would be Michael McDonald another chronic bland artist who people think has a great voice.Avoid!!!!!!"
4,A Novella Worth the Read,"I read this novella for a Middle Eastern Humanities course sixteen years ago in college and, through my instructor, had the good fortune of meeting Etel Adnan. The book was powerful and moving, granting me insight into a world so foreign from mine and yet similar in strange ways. I relished the discussions with Ms. Adnan after reading it. Her experiences, skill with language and unique vision make anything she writes worth reading. This novella is easy reading, but will definitely leave a lasting impression. After ten years in education, I still loan my copy to students for summer reading and have had each student I've loaned it to thank me for the experience."
1,BORING AND USELESS!!!!!!!!,This book is BORING and USELESS; it only leaves you with anawful feeling that you've wasted one minute too many evenlooking at it.
1,Lame customer service,"Similar situation as Amazon Jack. I placed the order, then waited several days without a change in order status. I contacted customer service to see what the delay was. Their response: ""We estimate shipment and delivery dates based on the availability of the items you ordered and the shipping options you selected.""My response: ""Is the item in stock, then?""The next day they gave me a refund without even contacting me. While I appreciate being refunded, I don't appreciate not being contacted, and especially not being told upfront that the item was out of stock. I could have already bought from another merchant and had the item by now.Not a very good way to do business if you ask me."
1,Wrong card,Antonline has the 256mb card for this price. Advertising should be corrected as it is not correct.
5,Great for Coffee Americano,"I love all of the Bodum double wall glass products....they keep my espresso and Cafe Americano preparations hot long enough so that the beverage can be savored at leisure, and the crystal clear glass gives one the opportunity to admire the crema as it rises to the top. Although the glass is thin, it is very strong....I wash in the dishwasher with no problems."
4,bodum double wall glasses,"Great glasses, though the description does not indicate the size, so they were a little bigger than i anticipated. Still nice and useful."
5,keeps my coffee hot!,I love the way these little glasses keep my coffee hot. I drink small cups at a time and usually my coffee gets cold too quickly. These are just the right size. They keep my coffee hot and eliminate the need for a coaster!
1,Peanuts,Very disappointed ordered 4 glasseds 2 have slready broken poor judgement on my part for purchasing--I was going to order more and also different sizes however after thids experience I am not
1,Don't judge Pickford by this,"Well, each to his own taste, but now that many of Pickford's best silents are out on video, it would be a shame to start with such an atypical role. This was a stage success for Helen Hayes, and probably Pickford copies her fairly well, but it's an ordinary Suth'n melodrama, produced at a typically glacial 1929 pace, and playing a bad girl of good family isn't what Pickford specialized in-- or ought to be remembered for. Check out Suds, Sparrows, My Best Girl, or any of the other silents in which she plays a delightfully spunky and mischievous young girl instead."
3,A Downer,"I love Mary Pickford but I guess I like her better in romantic comedies and comedies. The sound isn't that great, it's her first talkie. It's nice to hear her voice but it's too melodramatic for me. I miss her long curls too.That's why I'm elated to find this newly released collectionMary Pickford Signature Collectionwhich has 4 films for $4."
1,Even the best have bad moments,"There is no doubt that Mary Pickford is one of America's all time greatest and most beloved actresses. That doesn't mean she was exempted from mistakes, though. This movie is awful all the way through. It's boring, paceless an has the stiffest acting imaginable. Mary was especially nervous in her performance and I don't think that's because it was her first talking film. The problem is that she's playing completely against type. The sweet, lovable, smart and spunky little girl persona that she had perfected is gone and in it's place is the consummate man - controlling flapper. Sorry Mary, it just doesn't work."
2,I can't believe this had Mary Pickford in it!,"If you want to know why Mary Pickford was one of the best actresses of all time...don't judge her work on this movie. I had a hard time watching it all the way through. I kept thinking it'd get better. I think Mary even won an Academy Award for this one, although I don't know how, unless they were basically honoring her lifetime achievements. This movie definately did not stand the test of time."
2,not even an inch,To describe that what you got with this dvd was disappointingly brief would be litotes of hyperbolic proportions.
1,Awful,"I could print just 20 pages and it's powercard was broken down, awful product, happy it's not available any more"
1,Terrible product,"I received this printer several months ago, and haven't been able to print even one page on it. You should drop this seller from Amazon.com. I am very disappointed.Susan Farago"
5,Good Enough that I Keep a Spare,RPN is an excellent system and I love the features on this calculator as well as the feel of the keys. I bought a backup in case my original 32S (10 years old) failed and HP stopped making RPN calculators. It finally broke (my fault) so now I'm buying another spare.
5,Sniff - I'll miss it.,"This is the best calculator I have ever used. It was perfect, small and elegant. RPN made calulations quick, and the 4 stacks made multiple operations or complex equations easy to solve. It had everything I needed, if not graphing which i rarely do anyway save with a computer. I wish It hadn't been discontinued. I've used these since 1993, and would still have one now, if it hadn't been stolen."
5,baseball...,"This is a great soundtrack. We have and ""opening day"" hot dog party at my work every year. This was an awesome background sound track."
4,An excellent march through baseball time,"This CD contains classic and unheard-of selections through baseball's history. Seasoned with radio calls (again, famous and not), it is an excellent relaxing companion, either as background sounds while driving or reading the paper, or to just relax and listen to."
1,ZZZZZ,"This is one of the most boring literary novels I have ever read! The only good thing about the book was the beautiful cover w/ Fiennes & Blanchett. Carey's writing is at times beautiful, but the snail's pace put me to sleep."
2,Boring,"Sorry, but this book is not interesting. There are so many other good books I could have read instead. Don't recommend."
3,Surprised if not Shocked,"I found it amazing that so many enjoyed Oscar and Lucinder as much as they did. It was annoying long and extremely drawn out. I felt that the author could have done without the detail he used, and made Oscar and Lucinder much more creditable. A personal option, yes, but before entering into Oscar and Lucinder, read Bliss. You finish with a much higher opinion of Carey and his style of writing."
2,Way too Slow,"I thought that this book was going to be a romance. The title characters did not meet each other until page 193! I enjoy historical fiction, so the details do not bother me, but at half way through the book, I didn't feel like it had started. I am surprised at the acclaim that this book has received."
5,Oscar Winner,"For the first couple of, short, chapters I wondered whether this was my type of book. It was.We meet the appropriately nick-named 'Odd Bodd' Hopkins, whose appearance is as eccentric as his theological obsessions. Peter Carey explores his relationship with his Plymouth Brethren father. Neither fully admits the love for the other. Odd Bodd's other obsession, gambling, leads him to the equally compulsive Lucinda. From this moment on the novel took on a new dimension for me. The undeclared love, the social repression, the misunderstandings, the emotional gambling left me wanting to cry,laugh and bang their stupid heads together. The most frustrating love story since Remains of the Day.The opening paragraph prepares us for the inevitable tragedy. The finale does not disappoint."
5,Enchantingly Tangible,"As someone who hates perfect endings and neat little packages, this novel came as a wonderful surprise. Carey's off-the-wall, misfitted characters were delightfully real. His descriptions of Oscar and Lucinda--especially their eyes--made them tangible. I especially appreciated the way Carey addressed the problems women faced in Victorian society. Lucinda's struggles to be her own person and her determination in spite of ridicule were an inspiration. I found Carey's writing voice enchanting and rich in color and texture. I devoured this book and was delighted by my first encounter with Peter Carey."
4,the aftermath,"I just finished this book on my subway ride home. I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that my initial shock has subsided to the sort of wisdom and sadness that accompanies the ending of many great books. I do think that Carey's writing suffered a bit during the transport of the glass church; he reminded me a little of John Barth at his most self-indulgent, or something like that. However, it was still compelling, and evidence of the importance of the rest of the story-- the way he built the characters and set the stage.Interestingly, I read this immediately after Julian Barnes's ""Arthur and George,"" and in retrospect find the beginning of that book heavily influenced by this one. ""Oscar and Lucinda"" is a worthy read and one that will often hit you in the gut with laughter and pain."
2,Oscar and Lucinda review,"This book was chosen for my book club to read in May. One of our members had recently traveled to Australia and wanted a book that was set there. I had high hopes for this book but was disappointed. I love to read and read on average 3 books a month, but I could not get interested in this one. I felt the author got bogged down in too much religious philosophy and introduced too many unnecessary characters. I was glad to read it on my Kindle however. The dictionary feature was very handy."
3,Good but not as economical as rolls,"I got these because they were on sale and I wanted to see if having a pre-made bag was worth the time savings as compared to making bags out of rolls. In short, if you use your FoodSaver a lot, it probably isn't worth it. I keep a roll in my FoodSaver at all times anyway, so I only save the time it takes to seal the one end. And being able to custom size my bags does save a lot of bag material and, consequently, drop the cost. I'm glad I made the experiment, but I'll stick to the rolls."
5,Great noise-pop,"I heard about this hard-to-find album through a friend, and it's well worth your attempt to get it. ""Main Spirit Weind"" is noisy, straightforward and really catchy. The easiest way to describe their sound is that it's a cross between My Bloody Valentine (production), Pavement (vocals, vocal delivery) and the Beach Boys (pop sensibility). I can't stop listening to it!"
4,A great music cocktail!,"This is one of the records that make us think that we live in a global village. You can find a lot of references of many diferent cultures, but it's not a world music album, it's a transglobal record with lots of energy. I saw a live concert in Oporto with few people in the audience, but the band gave us an excelent performance. If you are bored with the mainstream, buy it now."
1,How did Manu get from here to Clandestino?,"I love Clandestino by Manu Chao. So I went looking for more by the same guys and decided to try Puta's Fever. Don't make my mistake. You have been warned, save yourselves now!"
4,Great movie,Strange Bedfellows is a lot like the full monty. It's a quaint Australian movie that will leave you with a smile. Ot's funny (not hillarious) A good movie.
3,A GAY CROCODILE DUNDEE?,"STRANGE BEDFELLOWS is a somewhat lighthearted examination of relationships, perceptions and masculine bonding. In an attempt to avoid bankruptcy, Paul Hogan (Crocodile Dundee himself) convinces his lifelong friend (a superb Michael Caton) to pose as his life partner to capitalize on a new tax law supporting gay couples. Of course, there is the expected coaching from the local male hairdresser (who is really straight but fakes his homosexuality because it's expected); a trip to a gay bar in Syndey where they bond with a collection of ""fops""; and the showdown at the big local dance. The movie is to be admired for its refusal to fall into the general stereotypical emotions about homsexuals, and for its sensitivity to relationships in general. It's not riotously funny, but is mildly amusing. Hogan seems a little too removed from the film to be effective, but Caton and the other supporting players (including Pete Postelthwaite as the investigator) are charming."
5,A Hogan Classic,"Some films are considered ""sleepers"". This is definitely one of them. I would recommend this film for adults. Just take the time and enjoy the tongue-in-cheek humor of this irreverent look at tax-evasion.Paul Hogan plays an amazing performance in this laugh-out-loud classic that shows how much a man can love his fellow man and still be a ""man"". Different that characters of the past, Hogan embraces a new ""life-style"" and creates havoc at every turn.Also starring Michael Caton, Alan Cassell, and a supporting cast that do a superb job."
5,Strange Bedfellows,"I saw this on cable before I bought it & knew I had to have it! It's funny & relevant.Strange BedfellowsA divorced man wants a tax break, newly introduced in Australia for gay partners.His widowed best friend goes along with it & hilarity ensues!"
4,"Not a breakthrough, but still entertaining","The subject of ""Strange bedfellows"" is nothing new - two straight men decide to pretend they are gays. We could see it in ""Boat trip"" for example.Nevertheless, there are two main differences: the background of the story and our main characters. Because of them, the plot isn't so corny and repetetive.The action takes place in rural Australia and our heros are in their 60's - the latter should be a clear message to those, who look for fresh bodies and some bare skin action.I am pretty sure that for some this film isn't so amusing, but I enjoyed it very much. The way it presents intolerance against homosexuality, typical for small comunities and older generations is true to form, thus funny at some moments, sad at other.In general it's a well made movie, with good acting and direction. Of course it has its place in my dvdteque :)"
4,Better than the remake,"The remake ( I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry) was a copy of this. Maybe I am biased being an Aussie, but this film is much better than the copy. OK...so you Yanks don't always understand the Aussie sense of humour. I love it...."
2,I have to agree....,"With the last review about this film. Working at a video store these days, my manager (who was going to send it back due to the content) decided to watch it and told me that it was funny...she must have a real bad sense of humor or something....not ""hilarious"" in the least. The story is cute, but both actors (although good in other films) failed to bring this one home. As mentioned in the last review, the humor is sub-par, and the overall picture is BORING!!! I chuckled a couple of times, but I did not ""laugh even after the credits have rolled"", as the box suggested. There needed to be more to this movie than what was offered.Dissapointed viewer!! I am not sure how this is going to sell to my customers...I may steer them clear of this one!!"
5,Passionate and Intelligent Playing,"Richard Goode has released a set here that is perhaps only equaled in interpretation by Schnabel. While he is passionate and emotional, he also brings intelligence and precision to the musical table. He has made his mark as a musician's musician, picking only those works to record which he feels are of the utmost importance to the repertoire. I love the fact that Goode is able to give us something this vital and heartfelt and yet never lose his head with raw emotion that is unshaped. This is my most treasured collection."
2,YIKES!!!,"I really wanted to just give this one-star, but what the heck, it's Christmas! I just finished listening (again) to Gieseking's magical early Beethoven sonatas (please see my review). This is the antithesis. The reason I'm going to cut Goode some slack (an apt term given his lackluster to the extreme playing) is that the recorded sound - maybe it's the piano itself - is so abysmal, and therefore the performance, maybe, isn't totally at fault. Who knows? Now to be fair, in this entire set there are some good renditions, and some excellent individual movements. But to get to them requires slogging through some of the most uninspired Beethoven playing ever set to vinyl-er metal. Run, don't walk---away!"
2,Never Knew Beethoven Could Be That Dull....,"All right -- he CAN play. But if he is ""correct"" in how he plays Beethoven -- especially the middle sonatas -- then Richter, Horowitz, Schnabel, Serkin, Ashkenazy, and even Brendel are wrong. So you make the call....Worse, it's dull listening. There is little spaciousness to the recording quality, and no atmosphere.Beethoven can be SO exciting -- but you'd never know it from these recordings.Pedestrian is the right word."
1,Elevator Music,"I tried to like this set- I really did. This was my first set of Beethoven's complete sonata's - it got great reviews and I was excited to get it but try as I might I had trouble enjoying it. Where was the passion, the dynamism, the creativity I associated with Beethoven? It was work getting through it - the music seemed dull, lacking in profundity and spontaneity. There was a kind of elegaic beauty to it to be sure but Goode seemed to me to be connecting with this music as from a great distance, as if it was a story he was telling about long, long ago.Then I picked up the Gulda set and there it was; the power, the dyanmism, the felicity, poetry and spontaneity of Beethoven. I tried Goode again, I thought maybe I had missed something but no, while it was pretty and elegant, the magic of Beethoven was gone again. For me this was homogenized Beethoven."
1,Vile...,"...truly vile.I've had this set for over five years. Sometimes I return to it, thinking it can't possibly be as bad as I remembered. I usually find it's worse. It's boring, unemotional, empty, pedestrian rubbish. Having forked out for it, after reading some 'reviews' (ha ha) from supposedly authoratative sources, I tried so hard to like it...but I just can't. There's just nothing here except the notes. The recorded sound is suffocatingly close, the piano tones hard and ungiving. Was the set recorded in a telephone booth by any chance?I guess the best performances are the ones of the late sonatas. The wonderful op.90 sonata in E minor is ok as is the tremendous 'Hammerklavier', op.106, even if the opening movement is under-powered. The fugue is a wild ride but compared with Gilels for example, there's no intricacy here. No thought.Oh well. Buy it at your peril. I've got a set for sale..."
5,Complete Box Set of Beethoven's Sonatas,"I agonized over what pianist's recordings to order for Beethoven's Sonatas, and enjoyed all the comments about people's favorite recordings. I'm very happy with Richard Goode's performance, and glad I ordered his set.The set came in good time and good shape - what I've come to expect from Amazon and its sub-sellers."
5,Havin' A Great Time,"Jerry Herman (piano and vocals) and Michael Feinstein (piano and vocals) have a great time singing a collection of Jerry's wonderful show tunes. It's great hearing them the way Jerry probably wanted them performed. If you like Jerry Herman's stuff and Micahel's singing and playing, you need this album."
2,Not Good,Very disappointed in this album. I own Michael Feinstein sings Irving Berlin and it is one of my favorite albums. But this Jerry Herman songbook album is just not very good. Michael's voice seems strained.
1,Learn to speak Vietnamese WRONG,"I bought this CD series to learn Vietnamese before I visited as a tourist. It was not easy as there is no written material The first thing I did was embarrass myself in thanking the airline clerk. I said, ""Come on ang.""Later I learned that ""ang"" was used with young children, not younger adults. The material never introduced the far more useful word for you, ""em"" which is used for colleagues, merchants and service people. It also did not teach the word, ""seen"" which is used for formal and plural you. Thus you can't properly say hello or thank you.Some of the phrases used are archaic or incorrect. This material is ""unsafe at any speed.""It amazes me that the Vietnamese people who did the speaking did not tell the producer of his error. I wonder if Pimsleur's other products are equally bad. Oh that there is not a ""Learn in the Car: Vietnamese."" That series is excellent in teaching tourists just what they need to know."
4,Better than expected,"After I gave up on a search for a good quality, new, wool blanket, I settled on this fleece one for outdoor use. As it turns out, this blanket is adequate for sleeping in fairly low temperatures and it keeps the wind out quite well. I was pleasantly surprised. It's also lightweight and rolls up nicely for attaching to my pack. Until I find the perfect wool blanket, I'll be happy with this fleece one."
5,Excellent memoir avoids devolving into syncophancy,"A very insightful, eminently readable memoir about the Narnia tales. David Colbert applies a judicious mixture of admiration and criticism in this volume, providing excellent references from mythology and Lewis' own life along the way. Of particular value is the afterword, ""Why Would Anyone Hate Narnia?"", in which Colbert delivers an unblinking assessment of the many prejudices and bigotries of C.S. Lewis."
4,Timeless assessment of American culture,"Though Chesterton died in 1936, his What I Saw In America presents an analysis of American (and British) life and culture which is as pertinent today as ever. Delivered with his delicately delightful wit, only his mild tendency toward wordiness keeps this book from a 5-star rating."
4,Great soundtrack,"I wouldn't call this the most consistent old-school game soundtrack, but I feel it has some of the best old game tracks out there. One flaw is that the songs do not loop; they only play once and then fade out in order to get all the tracks squeezed onto one CD ; nonetheless if you want some incredible tracks with thoughtful melodies, counterpoints, and atmosphere, this is a must-have!"
4,Must-have for fans!,"This is the original soundtrack from ""Seiken Densetsu 2 aka ""Secret of Mana"". The sound quality is crisp and clear. Each song plays only once (doesn't loop) but with this many songs they have to to get all of them on one disc. There's 44 tracks with a total 66:20 play time. The booklet and the track listing is all in japanese but you can find the track listing in english on freedb."
4,From Colors to Ray tracing with pseudo code,"This book is for the serious graphics programmer who wants to learn the techniques and how to apply them. I don't promise ""easy"": I do say necessary! With block diagrams for algorithms you can make code in any language from the discussion in this book!"
3,major flaw: heterosexism,"This book claims that it is on Chinese masculinity, but it gives no room to homosexuality in Chinese literature, as (not) shown in its index. It is very confusing. If this book is so into the crisis of Chinese masculinity, why does it entirely overlook homosexuals in China? Such a lack is even more puzzling, when the reader finds that thiis book in question heavily relies on Kaja Silverman's famous work ""Male Subjectivity at the Margins."" Silverman's book is so concerned with gay men and their representation. However, Zhong Xueping, the writer who relies on Silverman, simply ignores the possibility of gay representation in the Chinese context. This lack needs explanation. Or, it is a symptom of heterosexism of the seemingly gender-studies-concerned book."
2,Review of Camille,"I ordered the movie, Camille, because I love the actor, Colin Firth. He was very young in this movie. It was a beautiful period piece. But, O my, the plot was lame. Ben Kingsley and Greta Scacchi were wonderful, but you knew what was going to happen almost from the beginning. Next time, I order a movie I will do some research before I buy it. Great acting can't rescue a lame story."
3,As Bad As I Remembered It,"I remember seeing this on tv when it first came out. My impression then was that Scacchi was a horrible actress who just sat on screen trying to look pretty. I had forgotten that Firth was also in it, so I'd say his performance was forgettable.My tastes have changed so I was hoping that my take on the movie would also change. I love Dumas and know this to be a great story; however, this presentation of it falls short of the book. The movie lacks emotion. The viewer never gets a sense of Camille's motivation. She never becomes a sympathetic character. There is also very little chemistry between Firth and Scacchi. As the story relies on these two loving each other, this is a big blot on the enjoyment of the film."
2,Badly acted,"I am so grateful that Colin Firth became such a well loved acting figure. If he had stayed in the level he had achieved in Camille, he would be broke today. Yes, he was young, but there had to be better young actors at the time. I have a feeling he was chosen for this role because he was then, as he is now, mesmerising to look at."
2,So boring,I walked away from this movie before seeing the ending. It was boring. I did not like the sappy character Colin Firth played or the unfeeling tramp Camille was portrayed as. I gotta fall in love with someone in the story in order for the love story to make me feel the passion. Can I send it back for The Birds?
3,Camille,Colin firth in his early years. He shows his acting ability leading up to his academy award winning role in the King's Speech.
1,No Thanks,This was depressing and I did not like this movie. It's one of those story lines that you hope will get better by the end and it did not. Disappointed.
2,Camille Redoubt,"Famous nineteenth century melodrama about the consumptive courtesan and her affair (and death) with an impetuous love stuck youth. Top flight cast, including the VERY youthful Colin Firth as Armand and a ponderous Ben Kingsley as his father, cannot help the plodding drama although they struggle valiantly on. She dies and the event goes with her. Watch Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor instead."
2,Camille,I did not like the movie as much as I had hoped. When buying a movie or book I have found that Amazon does not allow for the customer to preview what the subject is about. I doubt I would have purchased the movie Camille if I had known what the story was about.
4,Camille,"This is an excellent story, beautifully produced.It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.I have never received any item from amazon that was anything less."
5,awesome!,Such a good movie. Keanu Reeves is so romantic.I thought it was filmed in Italy.Love this movie! Very romantic. I watched it three times already. Keanna Reeves is so sweet in this film. The grandpa has such a good understanding about the heart.Very well put together.Love this movie1
1,Movie Babe,"I think I bought Camille as a package with another English movie knowing nothing about Camille, but alsoknowing that I really like Colin Firth. While I don't always enjoy older movies, sometimes they are thebest. This one, however, was just too dated to be entertaining."
1,vapid film,"worth neither the time nor the money, escept for the beauty of sets and costumes, there is nothing to applaud in this flick. not even colin firth can redeem the picture. can you guess i did not care for this piece of cinematic emptyness?"
3,Better Colin Firth Movies Available,"Compared to other Colin Firth movies, this movie was very flat. I love period movies, and comparing to the likes of Jane Austin, this one pales in comparison. I had higher hopes for this film so was disappointed when I finished watching it.The character of Camille was not well formed. She gave a sub-par performance. Firth seemed stilted and robotic at times.The story line was a good one, and the potential for it being much more fleshed out would have made it much more endearing. So, it left me feeling like I wasted 100 minutes of my day.So, chalk it up to one not so hot purchase.I'll loan it to my daughter, with whom I LOVE to watch movies like this, but with a forwarning not to expect too much.I would recommend saving the $$$ and watching Pride and Prejudice again!"
2,Made for TV Movie,I tried to find information on this movie prior to purchasing the DVD but didn't find much. This is a 'made for TV movie' which means the budget wasn't that great and it shows. I purchased it for the great cast but even they could not elevate the quality of the production.
5,Colin Firth,I purchased this movie because I will watch anything with Colin Firth starring in it. This did not disappoint me. I found the movie very touching. I gave it 5 stars because of Colin Firth and Greta Scacchi.
3,"Great cast, not well written","Although I am a fan of Colin Firth, and it is interesting to see an early performance of his, this movie left me cold. The young Greta Sacchi was good. The scenery was good. The costumes, especially the men's hats, were cheesy and off-putting. The writing and direction and production are below average.Instead of this DVD, I recommend the wonderful Franco Zeferilli version of the opera starring Placido Domingo and the lovely Teresa Stratas. Search on Amazon is: Verdi: La Traviata Teresa Stratas. The opera is fast moving and of course a classic. This is the same story as Camille.Verdi: La Traviata"
1,"Even ""New"" tapes are poor quality video","I love to watch Colin Firth act so I bought this tape, twice.The first purchase was labeled as used, but the quality was terrible. It looked like someone had taped it from the tv, stopping at commercials, and then made hundreds of copies. This tape being the hundred and first incarnation. So when it showed up in an auction as ""New"" I hoped for a better quality video. Nope. Poor quality just like the other. Whatever you do, don't pay much for it."
3,Those tired stereotypes,"If you still believe that all French waiters are rude, that Parisians structure their lives around making unsuspecting Americans feel bad, and that being in France's commercial establishments means always being on your guard, then this is the book for you. Unevenly written (can't Frommer afford copy editors?) and sometimes downright silly, what this book nevertheless has going for it is an excellent and up-to-date list of restaurants, shops, bars, and hot spots (although look elsewhere for accommodations). That alone makes the book worth a look. The map of recommended establishments and the excellent bits of advice on how to take care of daily necessities make this book valuable, but it is unnecessarily smug, ultimately feeding into the same tired stereotypes of the French we've heard for years. As in any major city, no one in Paris much cares about insulting or dissing you, but this book would sometimes have you believe that it's the national pastime."
2,"Not so irreverent, and not so complete","If being irreverent is stating that Parisian waiters can be rude, then I've missed the point of this book somewhere. Everbody KNOWS that Parisian waiters can be rude. Just be rude back!I can't help feeling that Alexander F. Lobrano (Heidi Ellison in the first edition) have just dug around to exaggerate the things they don't like, and played down (or even omitted) the good things. For example, in a section marked 'Secret Gardens', how can Parc Andre Citroen be considered secret and Jardins Albert Kahn completely missed? It makes a mockery of claiming to be a true guide. Much better (if you're French-speaking) to get yourself a copy of 'Paris inattendu' by Michel Dansel. You get the truth AND a lot of fresh information."
1,Useless and without worth,"If you have bought other travel guides to Paris such as Frommer's or Fodor's, this ""Irreverent Guide"" will add nothing of value to your experience of Paris. It seems to me that the title is misleading and very gimmicky. Invest the ... + shipping in a good lunch for one. Or give it away to someone who needs it, or simply save it. This book is not worth it. I rate this book one star."
4,Extremely beautiful,This item is very detail and just beautiful to look at. The wings look so fragile and she is stepping on a real mirror. Tink's face was the only set back. It looked a bit odd. Overall it captures the pose very well.
4,Great for Japanese learning English,"I bought this book thinking it would b user friendly for English speakers learning Japanese, but it looks to be intended for Japanese learning English. Unless you have a good working knowledge of written Japanese, especially kanji, this may not be the book for you. I rated it at 4 stars because it is a very good book for it's intended auience."
4,This book is for Japanese to learn English!!,"If you are English speaker, and try to learn Japanese, this is not the right book for you. The picture is in both English and Japanese, but the guild and practice are for English learners. If you are trying to learn Japanese from this book, you will be very disappointed if you can't read Japanese Kanzi."
1,For Japanese Only,"This book is totally mis-reperesented on the basis of its title. It is NOT for use by English speakers. It is directed exclusively and only toward Japanese speakers and readers who wish to improve their English. It's a great book for the Japanese. If you're looking to learn Japanese from it, forget it."
3,"Great Lists, but many out-of-date resources","While I like the format, content, and applicability of the MANY lists included in this book, when searching for various sources listed as ""additional information"" I found many of the Online URLs don't work or have changed and books are not available or are out-of-print. Although this is a useful resource material, I'd like to see the ""additional information"" sources updated, then it would be one of the best resources I've found."
4,At My Place,"My wife and I (my girlfriend at the time) saw Venice back in the early 90's at AT MY PLACE in Santa Monica (a very missed venue) and fell in love with the group. Wonderful melodies and great energy on stage. TO my surprise, I was listening to another AT MY PLACE alum (Micheal Ruff) and could pick out Mark Lennon's voice on that CD also. I do wish they had a bigger fan base so we could hear much more music from this fantastic band"
5,One of Venice's early efforts-great addition to your collection!!,"Venice has been around for years and is one of the most underrated bands in America. They are wildly famous in parts of Europe and have two lead singers, Kipp and Mark Lennon, who along with their bandmates boast an amazing range of talents, from classic rock, to world beat, to pop, to acoustic harmonies remininsent of the 70s and 80s. Check them out-you'll love them!!"
1,DON'T BOTHER,"The light works, but that's about it. The wiring instructions in the manual and the wiring picture in the manual for the fan conflict. Customer service and technical support doesn't have a clue as to how to get the fan to work. But it doesn't matter, because the internal wiring is such that, well, no matter what, the fan will not work.On the positive side, Customer Service agrees that the electrical instructions for the fan are screwed up."
2,A mixture of linguistics & history,"This book tells the story of Italy, with emphasis on the languages spoken there. I don't like it so much because I was looking for something that is more a treatment of the development of Romance, with special attention to the hows & whys of the various languages & dialects that evolved in Italy."
4,"""Paper Garden""","Anthologies are not meant to be read from cover to cover. Fiddling some notion that fictional characters and non-fictional authors have disdain for one another? Anthologies are, perhaps, best read as bathroom bookshelf literature. With that said, the first story I read was ""Paper Garden"" and guess what, I forgot I was reading on a throne. Mission accomplished... America, replete with variegated archetypes, is an experiment in progress. Well done.Anthony James"
3,Ehh. Whatever. Take it or leave it.,"The concept for the format of this book is really intriguing. The content, however, is not especially dazzling. As I suspect most readers of this book will do, I jumped from story to story instead of reading from start to finish. And each time I finished a story and scanned up and down the table of contents looking for something to catch my interest, I was struck by the notion that I was reading a collection of stories by the crew of the Enterprise from Star Trek. There's a Russian guy, a Chinese guy, a Black guy, a White guy, a Southern guy, a French guy, a Native American guy, etc. And just because I'm saying ""guy"" doesn't mean there aren't exactly as many women as there are men (though I haven't counted, I'm sure there are.) There's certainly nothing wrong with that, but if that's what I was thinking about while I read the book, it should tell you something about how interesting the stories are."
4,Standard Tomtom One 3rd edition for 2nd car (minus dash mount),"The mount is the standard one that comes with the TomTom One 3rd edtion and it's nice the car charger is included, but it should come with the little black dash mount (not included). Also TomTom should sell the mount separate (incase you just want the mount)without having to buy this kit.If you plan on using this with a beanbag dash non-slip mount for CA or MN, it won't fit. Recommend TomTom part 9A00.183 Goose Neck mount for any beanbag dash non-slip pad."
2,Didn't get what is advertised!,"I ordered this expecting to get what was pictured, a window mount and a USB Car Charger. What I received was a standard car charger and a window mount. Contacted Amazon and a replacement was sent for delivery the next day. I received a replacement of the exact same item. Contacted them again and they said it must be an issue with the seller. I had to keep one of them as I needed to use my GPS that weekend. Be aware you may not get the USB Charger."
1,Would return this. . .,". . . if I'd been smart enough to retain my receipt. My TomTom doesn't fit in this, so it's absolutely, 100% useless! I thought it was just the placement in my vehicle that was making it difficult to mount the TomTom, but when I removed the mount from the window & tried to insert the TomTom, I found that the grooves in the mount are slightly closer together than the ridges in the TomTom. Useless, completely useless! I do, of course, have the extra charger, but maybe that doens't fit either; I haven't the heart to try it."
4,Tom Tom One - 3rd edition,Tom Tom GPS was just as described. It even provided more information than I expected. I would definitely recommend this product.
1,I can't believe that this is sold separately!,Haven't you people ever heard of velcro? Get a kit from any hardware store and make your own mount in about 5 minutes!
2,Only sticks on glass,"The only problem with this product is it only sticks on glass, not any other smooth surface. Other than that, it is fine."
4,Works as expected to.,Suction works well on window. I just needed the electrical adapter but they apparently only sell the adapter with the mount. The original adapter that came with the Tom Tom unit was quite flimsy and the wires came out of the unit within 6 months. I'll see how long this new one lasts.
4,TomTom Additional Mount Review,The product is fine but a little overpriced in my opinion! The shipping was efficient and it arrived in great condition. I think the price is driven by TOMTOM not this seller.
3,kinna pricey,"... it stays on the windshield even in cold weather, to much money for what it is though ..."
3,This does not fit a TOMTOM ONE 3rd Edition,"It is the same as the original TOMTOM mount, so it is great, but it DOES NOT fit the TOMTOM ONE 3rd Edition. Not sure what it does fit, but I know what it does not fit!"
2,tom-tom,"this does not come with the flat disc thaat glues to the dash, and will not mount securely without it. it is cumbersome to use, and would benefit from better software."
3,NOT Los Super 7,"Before even considering the quality of the music, let me say that I felt cheated by this CD. To sell this CD as the third from Los Super 7 is, to say the least, questionable. The first and second Los Super 7 CD's gave us a blend of Latino and Americana music, played with pioneering spirit. This third Los Super 7 CD just gives you Texas Americana. It is not particularly spirited or pioneering. Some songs are nice, but not more than that. Nowhere do the artists go beyond their normal scope. Furthermore, nowhere in the booklet the Los Lobos members, that to me formed the core of Los Super 7,are mentioned. Why aren't they here? Had I known beforehand I would not have bought this CD. The name Los Super 7 is misused for commercial reasons and the many fine musicians on this CD are not taken beyond there usual borders, which to me is the real betrayal."
2,ok- but there are better books on subject,Check out Bill Parkhurst's HOW TO GET PUBLICITY or Levinson's GUERRILLA MARKETING FOR WRITERS. They will teach you more.
2,Unimpressive,"Book Blitz,Getting Your Book In the News has some good basic ideas, but nothing particularly original. In addition, it lacks the level of detail that makes some other similar books superior to it. It is not the best choice for someone looking to move their new book."
3,"Wouldn't call it a ""pocket"" calculator.","It's bigger than I expected; however, it fits well in one hand.The hard cover, however, must be completely taken off the back of it and put on the front to protect it. It feels kind of flimsy. It could have been designed better.It's more comfortable to hold the calculator in your hand without the cover attached to it."
3,Larger than I anticipated.,"I once had a TI ""pocket"" calculator that was similar to the one pictured in this discription. It was small, compact, easy to use. The item I received was, unfortunately, significantly bigger than the one I had before (by about 30-40%). Functionally, it is the same and with its larger size, actually easier to use (somewhat larger buttons). Still, it was not what I expected."
1,IMPRESSIVE,FOR A SMALL CALCULATOR IT DOES A WONDERFUL JOB. LOVE THE CASE THAT PROTECTS THE SCREEN. KEYS ARE EASY TO USE AND WELL SPACED.
5,Helps break fighting patterns!,"Reading this book helped me identify why my husband and I keep fighting, over what appears to be nothing. I like that the list of 9 toxic thoughts are near the beginning - it makes it fast to identify what behavior you or your partner do that leads to a particular argument or creates tension in the relationship. Has helpful examples and questions to ask yourself. I liked the friendly, non-condescending tone of the writing."
2,you get what u pay for,i made a real mistake and took about 5 shoots after the first 1 because i wanted to post picture of what a mid power air rifle at over 20 did to the little target. i can tell u that this trap will not hold up to its own rated cal to use to give an example a beeman p17 pistol shoots a .177 pellet at 400fps give or take even these left a dent that removed paint on the outside of the housing any way only reason i give it 2 stars is because it looks nice and if you use it at over 30 yard with very low power rifle IT MIGHT STAND UP TO IT. for me it was no good the smallest thing i have is my p17 which is a target pistol since im not a pro marksman i don't think i can use a 10 yard gun at 30 with any accuracy everything else i have will probably damage this thing to much with one tin of pellet to use it again just spend a little more money and get something more solid.
1,Not worth the money,Do not waste your time this is a cheap flimsy item Use an old box your better off.
2,Spend an extra 5 to 10 bucks to get a better one.,Do not get this trap it's really not even that good. I did not buy this off amazon I got it from my gun club but it's the same exact thing so I thought I might rate it on here. I am A competitive pellet shooter down in AZ and I got this trap. My gun dented this trap up so bad it's warping on the back. 2/5 stars.
4,Works as described,This trap works well- stops and traps the pellets. I shoot .177 domed pellets at 525 fps and no dents or anything. The spinners are neat and have also held up to 100's of pellet hits. My only complaint is it is a little small.
2,Disappointed,"John Thaw is good as Regan, as is Waterman but the rest of the cast are pretty bad. The background music/sound drowns out the dialogue and it is difficult to hear what the actors are saying. Too bad there isn't any cc but I didn't expect that there would be and I don't think that it would have improved the series. Lots of shouting and racing around and I am sorry that I watched the early acting of John Thaw. I so enjoyed Morse and it is obvious how much his acting skills improved. Really disappointed with ""The Sweeney"" and would not recommend it as it is too dated."
2,Too out of date for me,"I have to agree with the other viewer who found this too 70's to be of much interest now. What may have been gritty and hard-hitting in the 70's is pretty tame stuff now. Compared to NYPD Blue, and even Hill Street Blues, this is simple, slow and feels much more like TV than reality.If you weren't a fan of this show when it aired, I'd try to rent a disc before investing in this set."
1,Does not fit 2008 Nissan Frontier,"States that it fits 2008 Nissan Frontier but it does not, install attempt as per instruction, yet posterior hole of step is 4 inches too far rearward. Returned item and charged for return shipping. How is it that Amazon claims that it this matter not their error. I will no longer order items that Amazon claims it fits or is compatible with existing or specific types of vehicles."
1,Too Large,"Lots of reviews warned this type of shoulder pad was too large under most fashions. Yes, unfortunately this is true. They are much too large and do not stay in place very well, so this was not a great purchase for me. But on the up side, the seller sent them very quickly!"
1,Football anyone?,"These shoulder pads are ENORMOUS! I called to exchange and was put on hold for atleast 10 minutes. The seller, Lauren Silva, has a lousy return policy. They will not let you exchange your item which means you have to pay full shipping again, which is overpriced to begin with. Normally I do not do negative reviews however I would like to save you all from grief. I would not purchase from this company again!"
2,Hard to Handle,"Personally, I found this device difficult to work. It looks like it should be easy but all I wound up with was a mess of knotted hair. It doesn't seem to ""braid"" your hair as much as it just twists it. You slide the ends of two strands of hair under these little metal clamps and then press the button which spins them like mad. Maybe someone with more coordination than myself would enjoy this product but it didn't work it's magic for me."
1,More Trouble than it's worth,"I thought this product would save me time but it actually took longer to produce a head full of two-strand twists than had I just used my own two hands. If you like gadgets, maybe this is for you but if you are looking to save time, don't both. Do it yourself."
2,This book is designed for every human to improve skills.,This book is a fine reference for anyone wishing to be in the wide world of buisness. It will show you how to deal with people when in a tight spot or how to convince people of your thinking and put your words so that they demand attention fropm the listner sop that you are chosen or they are convince of your worthyness.
1,one of the worst,"I feel very sorry for all the actors that had to play in this gruesome movie.Terrible plot, dialogs and score.Well, if you like watching half-naked guys in a swimming pool it might cover your expenses, otherwise I suggest you choose something else."
1,YOUNG BORELOCKS,"Having seen the first of this series, we could immediately guess when DeCocteau would use slow motion scenes where the studs walk around the campus. These scenes are ridiculously stupid, as they serve no means whatsoever.Again, we see lots of studly beefcake in their underwear, and yes, Virginia, this is a homo-erotic movie. Didn't you notice the way Luc looked at John while he was supposedly screwing Torrie? And the scene in the swimming pool, kissing the tears. Come on, DeCocteau is obviously heading for the gay audience; even though there are not homosexual scenes, the inferences are there.And the long drawn out rape scene is so stupid, the music is something out of the eighties and nineties, and there is not one genuine thrill in the whole movie.And the ending....these kids have no remorse over the people that have died due to their own selfish motives.Yuck, what a waste of time."
2,Boo - hiss,"Not much more to say about this movie than has already been said in other reviews. I thought it was just me who had these views on this movie, obviously not. If I could give this movie a -20 I would, and that is no exaggeration"
4,Bad Gay Porn,"First of all, I was at Hollywood video getting ""The Brood"" and when I popped the movie in that night, I didn't notice it was the wrong movie until it was over and I took it out my VCR.Don't get me wrong, there are some nice looking guys in this film and I was pissed they didn't do(...) to each other but this movie is kinda gay. Like with the pool scene and when the guys are rapping the girl. And these so called models they casted in this movie were alright but one dude in there had some big (...)lips. They were so big he could kiss two people at the same time, but other than that, the movie is about this new guy comes to town and he offers these 3 guys to offer they're souls to the devil by breaking all 10 commandments.It was alright, but I wouldn't get emotional and say it was grrrrrreat."
2,"Trashy, but at core has some good ideas","It makes sense that this film has some sort of Roger Corman 8-10 day shoot schedule at the core of it.The film NEEDS desperately to have at least a few scares in it, but it fails there.The Sexuality? Who cares???This film fails as a Horror film. Hopefully someone might take the central ideas and rewrite the film with a bit of a budget.Even so, if Scarecrow can do what it did for a low budget, and even the somewhat larger budget BUBBA HO TEP can basically run on the sniff of an oily rag, I think something needs a fix for this failed horror flic."
3,The brotherhood 2 young warlock,"If you are a fan of David Decoteau film, which I am, you will love this cheesey,homoerotic movie. Lots to laugh at and a good time. If you like half naked men a plus"
3,Evil Boys In Boxer Briefs,I was really looking forward to this sequel but I was disspointed- the story is weaker- frat boys practicing withchcraft-but of course the real reason to see this flick is the cast of good looking young men running around in boxer briefs- Sean Farris (the Tom Cruise look alike) is worth the price of admission- too bad his bisexual threeway scene does not go far enough- I guess we'll have to wait for the directors cut...
1,A total mess,It seemed like a very low budget film with terrible special effects. The acting and directing were horrible. I think I laughed through most of the movie. It was a complete waste of money.
4,Great movie!,"Okay, I think this is the best David DeCoteau movie! Of course it has homerotic overtones, but doesn't just about every one of the DeCoteau movies. I think some of the half naked scenes are long, but that is his trademark. Good movie!"
1,One I could have done without ...,"If you're expecting a horror/thriller/suspense movie here like I was, forget it. Really. A complete waste of time.I made the mistake of buying the entire series because of the write-ups on the back covers. The only all-pervasive theme that ties this ""series"" together is swelling music and close-ups of rippling muscles and young male bodies undressing down to their identical boxer briefs. Oh, one more theme that ties the series together comes to mind ... major head-tripping male ego follow-the-leader games.Pure silliness is simply not my thing. If it's yours, hey ... go for it!:-)"
4,DVD format,We could only view the movie on our computer. Neither of our DVD players in the house would accept the format. It was a bit of an inconvenience. Other than that the movie was good.
4,"Nice sheets, Great value","While these are not quite as thick as some of our more expensive flannel sheets, they are nice and soft, cute and excellent for the price!"
3,Nice for the price,"I really didn't expect too much considering the low price but these are ok flannel sheets that wash and dry nice - I didn't have any pilling or lint problems like others have reported. They aren't the best flannel sheets I ever had and expect they will only be good for 2 seasons, maybe 3,but for the price they are good."
1,Flaw in the flannel....,"Disappointing. The sheets looked good, put them on the bed, two days later found a hole right in the center of the bottom sheet...looked frayed around the edges as if the material was flawed. Cute sheets though I had to return them."
4,rolls vs. bags,"The 8x11.5"" quart bags are more convenient to use, but I figured the 8"" x 22' rolls would be more cost-effective. As it turns out, the rolls (at $18.69 for 44 bags' worth - assuming a foot per use) are slightly more expensive than the bags (at $18 for 48), so you might as well get the bags. As for being able to use more or less as needed, I've found that I can re-seal or re-use the bags, thus leaving me an assortment of available sizes when I've used their previous contents. It is occasionally useful to have larger sizes, so I would recommend purchasing the bags in the quart size & the rolls in the larger 11"" x 18' to give a wide range of useful applications."
4,Food Saver Bags,"I have been an amazon customer for quite a few years now. The food saver bags are really great for storing, and i like there product. But shop around for a better deal on pricing, because amazon is not always the cheapest place to buy this item. After i bought 4 bags of diferent sizes an paid what i thought was a great price,only to find out later i could have gotten the same items at Sams for a whole lot cheaper! Now don't get me wrong, I still will shop at amazon, an will still be looking for the super saver on shipping, which i don't think any other competitor can match."
5,works excellently with foodsaver unit,"The quality of these bags surprised me. I'm so used to the common supermarket variety, that I was plesantly surprised at the heft of these bags and how well they took a vacuum and held it."
3,Pretty Good,Price is right and it controls iPhones and iPods well. Plus the sound quality is pretty good.
4,Surprisingly Good Album from Prince's ex-bandmates,"It's almost a travesty to refer to Wendy and Lisa as Prince's bandmates. The older I get, and the more Prince continues to put out nominal work, the more I realize and appreciate the musical talents of Wendy and Lisa. They are highly gifted musicians/arrangers, and though we may never know how much they wrote or didn't write (thanks to Prince's legal contracts) for the Revolution we can still get a taste of it here. Giving a nod to the Beethoven symphony of the same name, Eroica demonstrates all the things that made prince music so cool for me up until 1988. So do yourself a favor and buy this album today. I guarantee that you will be quite pleasantly surprised by what you hear. I'm constantly playing this album for people and they are shocked that it didn't make mainstream radio."
5,A PIECE OF ROCK AND ROLL HISTORY!!!!!!,"so the ladies pulled a 360!!!!!this wasn't a r&b funk album!this was a rock influenced jam session!i can highlight this album by saying""mother of pearl"",""skeleton key"",""strung out""and the awesome lisa on""dont try to tell me""!!!!!i never buy an album that has less than three cuts on it!this is the type of album you by and not hear a track!it is a masterpiece!!!!!cpoe it while its around because it was and is a all-around vicious album!!!!!"
2,Pretty Lame,"This book received such good reviews that I ordered it for my first-grader, thinking it would certainly be a winner. I sent it back without giving it to him, however, because I found the riddles to be VERY lame. I give it 2 stars, because the book quality is quite nice: nice hardback, feels good in your hands, well constructed, colorful, fun illustrations... I almost kept it because of all of those positive features, but for a child who loves jokes and riddles, the content would have been a big disappointment."
1,Terrible battery. not worth the price,"What can i say. This battery lied to me. It would show great batter life in the beginning, but faded fast. After a few months i couldn't even get 5 minutes of shooting out of it. Bought a true Sony battery and all is now fine. Stay away. I saved $30 but it cost me some priceless moments and wasn't worth it."
1,Died Young,"The original Sony batteries (made in Japan) lasted over 8 years. The Ultralast (made in China) barely made it a year. The original battery stopped charging when it was full. The Ultralast seems to just keep on charging, which may be the factor that shortens battery life. It worked great for a while, but is all but dead now. It died too young."
4,Good to have a spare,"I no longer have the Sony camera that this fit but it was well priced, held its charge and was the correct product delivered as promised."
4,Nice Job,"This was nicely done all round. Voice/Music/arrangement. She has a clear sound with smooth verbrata.Some songs are very athletic. Especially""Glitter and be Gay"". Those high notes must feel like her head is going to explode.This stays in my favorite section for musical (most of my collection is art songs)."
5,Fun and effective!,My Great Dane rescue has a permanent injury on his front paw which requires it to be covered so he won't chew it. He chews it even though its healed so that's why I say permanent. The old solid colors were so boring but these add a little style. Dog's don't care but it spruces my big guy up for his walks around town. The tape is great and reusable for a time. It stays put and holds in place.
2,Disappointing,"I am a HUGE Armistead Maupin fan. I love ""Tales of the City"" and I really liked the book this movie was based on. However, a quirky novel was turned into an extremely dark movie. Many of the side stories in the book that alleviated the tension of the main story line were omitted. At only 82 minutes running time, they could have added more of the book to the movie. Also, while not a real ""San Francisco"" story like Tales, it was a mistake to relocate the action from San Francisco to New York City."
1,"bad plot, bad script, not worth even renting","This film wouldn't have survived the old Twilight Zone's selection process even for 30 minutes. Repetitive dreary score underlines this shabby short little attempt at drama, surely not much mystery involved, and as to ""Thriller"", we were plain thrilled when it was over, or was it? Willams is Williams but this baby must have not only been a cheapo to produce, but apparently they avoided the cost of a good director and screenwriter in the bargain. Robin's rehab bills must be piling up to take this kind of gig.Buy it? We wouldn't even recommend renting it!"
4,"Not bad, intense...","this is a pretty good movie, it keeps you thinking. it a pretty good meystery. Robin williams is great."
5,A Mystery for Adults,"A brilliant book turned into a moody, mysterious, atmospheric film for adults only. The characters are well developed in surprisingly little time; the plot keeps you watching as the book kept the pages turning. The pacing, style, dialogue are all aimed at adults who think as they watch, so that they can fill in what, at first, seems to be missing (but isn't). This is not for those looking for action, neat plot tie-ups, or answers to everything life puts in our way. Positively not for the 12 - 25 year old set. Sit back, turn the lights way down low, turn off the cell phone, put the kids to bed, and watch! You won't regret it."
3,Compelling and creepy,Went to this movie knowing almost nothing about the plot so that made it all the more interesting. The acting by Robin Williams and Toni Colette are what carry the movie along. To me this movie is reminescent of the Sixth Sense but with 2 less stars.
2,The Night Listener will hear you snoring!,"The night listener will hear you snoring. It will because this film will put you to sleep. Robin Williams is a great actor but not even he could save this film. Some of the story has bite in the mystery and suspense department, but the department soon gets shut down. Some of the characters are so unbelievable that it really takes away from a story that had promise. I rented this movie and I did not buy it. I do not feel it has any value as a must own for future viewings. It would not even do good collecting dust in your DVD collection. There are much better, more qualified films out there when it comes to keeping dark suspense around every corner, instead of zig zagging like supernatural shadows with no direction. It might be that this film is enjoyed more by those who liked the book it was taken from."
2,"Sadly, it just doesn't cut it","I love Maupin and I loved The Night Listener. When I heard that it was being made into a film, I was rather surprised but very curious to see how it would work. Unfortunately, the results are just fair. The cast (some of them surprising choices) acquit themselves quite well here and I have no quibbles with that. However some of the other choices are more unfortunate: the move to NY from SF, the Disneyfied core issues of Jess and Gabriel's relationship, and the extremely visible Toni Collette. Her performance (as is usual) is excellent, but her physical presence is too much there from the beginning and distracts from the mystery at the core of the story. The novel had a much more palpable sense of loneliness and desperation throughout that kept the readers' emotions much more on edge.A brave try, though."
2,Not interested,"I didn't like I though that it could be interesting, since I like his movies, but I did not like, the end is make non-sense"
2,Wanted to Like but Just Couldn't,The Night Listener is a dark (mild) suspense about a gay radio personality who develops a phone relationship with a sexually abused 14-year-old writer with AIDS and his foster mother. A series of circumstances cause him to begin doubting the existence of these two people and he begins investigating them to the point of becoming a stalker.It was a weird convoluted and confusing film; especially in the opening scenes where the boy and woman are shown on the other line. Once was enough and I'm glad I didn't pay to watch it at the theatre. It was one of those movies where we kept checking the time and hoped it would be over soon.
1,Hitchcock - I think not!,"Why this is touted as a thriller is beyond me. The movie is really about 2 things. The title character's being fooled by a woman (and it takes him years to figure it out) and his breakup with his boyfriend. There is no substance beyond that. There are no thrills. It is self-indulgent and tedious. It is an insult to the Hitchcock's memory to classify this film as similar to anything he ever did. His worst film (and he made some stinkers) is ten times better than this clinker. The only reason I kept watching was in the fond hope that somehow there would be a surprise or a revelation that wasn't self-evident to anyone with even a few functioning brain cells.Please, Mr. Williams, stick to comedy!"
2,Sleepy Time,"An unsatisfying film version of Armistad Maupin's equally unsatisfying roman a clef, THE NIGHT LISTENER is carefully made, but doesn't add up to much. Like fellow comic Lily Tomlin, Robin Williams in dramatic roles manages to damp down the brilliance of his gift without coming up with a satisfactory replacement for that rapid-fire wit. He works hard here, but it's a safe bet many other actors would have been more successful in this role. On the other hand, the always-impressive Toni Collette adds another indelible portrait to her gallery of screen women; eerie and frightening, she's like some creature hauled, gasping and blinking, from a subterranean lake. An excellent supporting cast and handsome cinematography can't help much, either. This material's simply too inconclusive for its own good."
3,hmmmmm........,"interesting movie; sandra oh plays robin's friend. at the end the last 2 phone call voices, to me, sound just like sandra oh and that threw me a little. i started to think that she might be in on the scam. i guess i must have been wrong. still, i challenge you to try and disagree with me. the voices were suppose to be toni collette's character and or her doing 'pete'. sure sounded more like sandra oh to me. does anyone else think this ? if so - email me at jackielang@charter.net"
4,I mostly liked this one...it kept me guessing until the end,"It was a bit confusing though, more of a mystery than a thriller (be sure to watch the deleted scene in the bonus section of the dvd - it clears a few things up.). Toni Collette's performance was incredible - I was both intrigued and terrified of her. I was also terrified of her house and the water tower. Seeing Robin Williams in a non-comic role is always a bit disquieting...such as his role inOne Hour Photo (Widescreen Edition). Sandra Oh seemed underused, but I liked the few lines she did have, such as the Southern drawl impersonation. Also, the sad, haunting music fit very well throughout the movie.Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy is quite an intriguing disorder - but that is all I will say about that."
3,Dreary and Scary,"Dreary because the film was shot in such a cold atmosphere of a dark setting, but the contents were scary enough. Excellent Acting! Robin Williams gets better and better!"
4,Haunting,"It skirts with melodrama, but The Night Listener is saved by great acting from Robin Williams and the always wonderful Toni Collette, who is particularly remarkable in this role. The fact that the film is based on a true story adds additional value, and weight, to this haunting story. If you rent the DVD, don't miss the extra features: Armistead Maupin and his ex boyfriend, Terry Anderson, talk about the fascinating real-life event that inspired the film."
4,Good little suspense movie,"This is a nice departure for robin williams again, and tells the tale of a radio show host who in the business of promoting books, he stubles across a pre-published book from his publisher that is shocking, and written by a 14 year old. Through a few channels, the kid gets ahold of his number and over a 9 month period they strike up a relationship. Then, a revalation occurs, and doubt is cast over the whole book and legitimacy of the novel. Rent or buy this movie, you will not be dissapointed. A great film for robin williams fans if you liked his performaces in Insomnia or Final Cut. The funny man has a lot of depth to offer."
4,"Interesting little movie, creepy & strange","If I hadn't had watched the TV program in regards to this moviethis wouldn't have made much sense, not that it actually doesbut the acting fits the mood of the movie. This story is a strange one, it would have made a nice twilight zone, short and full of questionsthat never really get answered(bad childhood?) but if you're looking for a moviewith a touch of the strange this one fit the bill pretty well. RobinWilliams plays it straight while Toni Collette shines perfectly in her errie little role."
4,Interesting film,"Inspired by a true story, this sad tale of an abused boy becoming phone friends with a gentle radio show host is heart breaking. When a publisher friend considers publishing the boy's book without having met the boy or checked out the story, William's character grows concerned. He decides to try to check the story out himself and finds he's getting the run around from the boy's adoptive mother. Is the boy and his story real, or is it a mentally disturbed woman's cruel hoax? The movie can get slow at times, but the acting definitely shows prowess and the versatility of Robyn Williams and the very talented Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Cosi, Little Miss Sunshine).Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,Gay overtones,Robin has some good works but this is not one. Would not recommend this movie. There are lots of better chooses.
3,decent,"Have not seen this movie before, but it's pretty good. Have not seen this movie before, but it's pretty good."
2,Fair,"New York writer and radio show host Gabriel Noon is breaking up with his male lover. He is so dustraught he cannot work. He seems lost when his agent puts him in contact with a boy prodigy writer, Pete, based in Wisconson. When he finally visits he finds the boy may not exist but be the invention of a blind women, Donna.The Night Listener has a better premice than execution. When Gabriel arrives in Wisconsin he discovers Donna gave him a false address. Most people would have returned to the Big Apple right there, but Gabriel goes to extraordinary lengths to confirm Pete's exsistance.There is not enough at stake here for the search to seem plausaible, and you wonder why a sophisticated New York writer would waste his time on such an obvious hoax. By the end you really don't care.I like the acting here of both Robin Williams and Toni Collette, but as a film, I don't buy it."
2,The other side of Robin Williams,"Robin Williams is a very funny and entertaining man. He has been able to make comedy films (Patch Adams) and serious films (One Hour Photo) succesfully. ""The Night Listener"" would fall under the serious side of Robin Williams.""The Night Listener"" is about a gay man Gabriel Noone (Williams) who has his own late-night radio program. Noone starts talking to one of his biggest fans on the phone. This mysterious person is very sick, so Noone decides to pay a visit to this person he has only talked to on the phone. On his journey, Noone has reason to question the identity of this person.""The Night Listener"" had great potential, but never really developed into a great mystery film. Also, I don't think Williams's character needed to be gay."
3,"great acting, predicatbale storytelling","An interesting mystery that would've been better left off unresolved in the end. Toni Colette is enchanting as a blind woman who might or might not have adopted a child who was viciously sexually abused. The film plays up on our emotions, but never goes as far as to shake our core and make us question the reality. In other words, it never transcends the screen. Robin Williams also churns out an impressive performance as a gay anchor of a radio show."
2,Lacking Substance,"A lonely gay man begins a telephone relationship with an abused young boy. Later he sets off to find him and his female caretaker after convincing himself the boy really doesn't exist. This movie is supposed to be based on truth, but I couldn't believe any stable adult would do what he did. The film focused too much on the main character being homosexual. The phone friendship between the boy child and the adult male seemed inappropriate from the onset. Their conversations included cursing and light sexual content. There were a few creepy moments, but certainly not enough to call this a thriller. It ended rather abruptly and loosely. The saving grace to this film is that it is only 75 minutes in length."
4,GOOD MUSIC,"GREAT MUSIC FROM A ONE OF THE BEST COMPOSERS OF THE XX CENTURY ALONG WITH BURT BACHARCH, BRIAN WILSON AND PAUL MCcARTNEY."
1,Buy some other Gershwin,"There is a reason this show closed after 46 performances. One critic called it ""devastatingly routine"" and that it is. Ira Gershwin called one of the songs he did for this show ""the worst lyric I ever wrote"".If you did a blind listening of the music, it would be hard to tell it was written by George Gershwin. Ditto the lyrics by Ira. This recording would be useful only to Gershwin scholars. I found it useful in a practical way---just to remind myself that giants like the Gershwins are not gods. They did have an all-too-human flop. I'd buy another Gershwin instead of this disappointment. I gave it just one star and that for effort, not results."
4,Good as far as it goes,"While this is a very good and exhaustive compendium of the British ships involved, this book, like so many other written in English, gives quite short shrift to the fleets of France and Spain. 162 pages are given to the British fleet, and a total of 72 pages to include BOTH the Spanish and French fleets! Further, the detail given about the Spanish and French ships themselves is quite sketchy, and includes few drawings or diagrams, and in most cases these are from British sources.Granted, most of the French and Spanish ships simply did not have the kind of lengthy and varied careers that most of the British ships had, but all the more reason to have a better look at their design particulars. What a pity the authors did not stir themselves and collaborate with the inestimable Mr. Boudriot of France for a proper view of 'the other side!'All that said, this is an excellent volume, especially if your main interest is the British ships involved (they DID win the battle after all!)."
1,looks can be decieving...,"When i saw this on the internet i thought it looked amazing, the silver beads looked nice. When it arrived to my house the box didn't weigh a thing, i opened it and the bracelet looked horrible. I couldn't believe i spent 13 dollars on this crummy bracelet. The only thing that seemed to interest me anymore was the heart shaped charm so i replaced all the beads and spacers and made my own bracelet."
2,power of un,"Have you ever traveled back in time then the power of un is a good book for you. The main characters in the power of un is Roxy, Gib, Ash,and Raeny. I would like to recommend this book to people that like to think when they read. It is about this kid Gib whose sister gets hit by a tramedsily fast truck. A misteris man gives him a michein that can un do mistacs. He uses it to save his sister and they live. The dog that Roxy was chasing when she got hit by a truck they capt for a pet and that is why I like this book"
4,"Good indy release from Dallas, TX","The Golden Falcons (now apparently disbanded) released this album, The Honduras Album, in 2006. Despite the complete misconception by the previous reviewer, this band has no pretense of representing Honduran folk music. Quite to the contrary, The Golden Falcons a represent lo-fi / dark rock / garage rock sound. My favorite tracks on this album are ""The Crush"" (imagine The Cure + NIN), Tracy Rabbit & The One Gin Fakie. The Golden Falcons were a very good live performance band and the tracks on this album do a good job of reflecting that. If you're into indy rock that carves a dynamic soundscape, The Honduras Album will probably find a place in your favorite play list."
2,"Smell-good oils, not essential oils",The gardenia and lilac smell ok. These are not powerful pure essential oils though. They are just kinda nice smelling oils.
3,Smell is a Little Different...,"The oil smells lovely, but is not quite what I expected. I have a sandalwood sculpture as well as sandalwood incense and the oil doesn't smell like them. It may be that the oil is too concentrated and will smell more like sandalwood when used. At the moment it smells a great deal like pine."
2,Holy cow this is boring,"I love Philip Glass. I listened to the Koyaanisqatsi soundtrack for six months straight. I love Glassworks. I have several soundtracks and enjoy them all. So it was with a much excitement that I ordered this three-CD set. It's been a big disappointment. As another reviewer said, the pieces are unpleasant to listen to and contain very little variation. In a word, they're grating. You can click ahead in five-minute increments within a piece and hear no difference. The only pleasure I get from this is turning it off. Ahhhh....peace."
3,"Well, maybe not the *best,* but pretty good.","Projects in this volume include traditional samplers, framed pieces, contemporary motifs, afghans, florals, door hangers, pillows, coasters, table linens and napkin rings, picture frames, birth samplers, tags, pouches, nameplates, stockings and more.The color photos are nice, though most projects do not have close-up images. They do depict how the project might be used in a room setting. The charts are symbols of black and red ink on blue graphs.This book is a nice, inexpensive supplement to a cross-stitch library."
4,"a pretty good book, something for everyone","I checked this book out of my local library, and it's actually pretty good. There are color photos of every finished pattern, and the charts (several in color) are very easy to follow.Most of the patterns can be stitched by beginner to intermediate stitchers and do not involve specialty stitches. There are some nice samplers, a really cool nautical alphabet design, and a cute alphabet pattern for children.The book is chock-full of patterns. There really should be something of interest to everyone in this book."
3,Nice,"This book has some very lovely patterns in it. The only down fall is that the patterns are not in color, so they're a bit hard to follow. A lot of the patterns have a little bit of an ""antique"" feel. Very pretty patterns and also some original designs are included with this book. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this purchase."
4,It's a pretty book,I really haven't started any project in the book but the illustions in the book is beautiful. I am very glad I got it. I will be making lots of cushions and pillows using the patterns in the book.
4,Highly overlooked 80's pop with some hidden classics,"Culture Club's third album, like all the other reviewers have noted, was very underrated when first released. This is a shame as it has some great music on it, particularly for Culture Club fans. Best tracks are ""The Dive"", ""Unfortunate Thing"", ""Mannequin"" and ""Mistake No. 3"". Both ""The Medal Song"" and ""The War Song"" are quite silly but they're still a lot of fun in the context of the album. Despite the atrocious cover artwork and the obviously rushed lyrics, this is still a great place to rediscover all that was great about the 80's. Also recommended is CC's new release ""Don't Mind If I Do""."
3,A Hurried Effort,"I bought this album when it first came out and was a little disapointed. But I was expecting asequel to Colour By Numbers. Its a far cry from that album,BUT it is amust have for any Culture Club fan.The songs dont seem to make much sense but they have a catchy tune to them. ""Mistake #3"" is probably the best track on the album. And ""HelloGoodbye"" is the most fun to listen to. Cant quite explain ""The War Song"" but it made a great video.All and all its a nice album to listen to and just relax. If you come across it I would buy it because this CD is hard to find.(rare) Enjoy!!"
5,Eclectic and Fun Mix of Songs,"This CD is a must-have for any true Boy George/Culture Club fan. Although this album was not commercially successful, it's a solid release with a true sound of the 80's. What I find most amazing about this release is George's vocals; powerful and at their most soulful. I really enjoy each track on this collection, but my favorites are ""the Dive"" and ""Crime Time"". As with most of George's lyrics, there are underlying messages in each song, with the exception of ""The War Song"" with it's in-your-face, blunt statement that ""War is Stupid and People are Stupid"", which offended the overly sensitive when released in 1984.Overall, this is a great effort by CC that most people overlooked."
1,Horrible set,"Not at all happy with these sheets. They barely fit on the bed- even before being washed for the first time. Afterwards, it is nearly impossible to get around all 4 corners. I get quite the workout! The sheets are constantly wrinkled and are thin and seem cheap. I stopped putting them on my son's bed entirely. Fairly cheap, but still not worth it."
1,Poor,"I liked this sheet set at first but then after a few washings, the fitted sheet shrunk and barely fits on the mattress. I am now shopping for new sheets!! Although I did like that the flat sheet was fitted on one side so it does stay on nicely. I just wish it didn't shrink!!"
4,Good inexpensive sheets,"I purchased this not really knowing what to expect. The sheets fit tightly, but I had no problems putting them on compared to the other fitted crib sheets I've used. The sheets were softer than I anticpated too. They do wrinkle since they are 100% cotton, but are still good quality for the price."
4,Quality Product - but it gives you FISH BURPS,"I just bought this product. Fish Oil is great! A month ago, I took Nature's Bounty Fish Oil for a few weeks, and to my surprise, I was more productive at work -> my mind was clearer; it improved my brain functioning, and no fish burps. I advise you to take it in the morning - however, be wary of the side effects - for now, all I notice is small fish burps - and some stinky farts. I'm a businessman, so it's important that I don't burp/fart around the client! :) That said, PureGels Omega-3 seems to be a better quality product - with a detailed title like ""Cold Water Fish Oil EPA 300 mg/dha"" sure sounds like they know what they're talking about. We'll see how I do in a month."
2,No argument with the thesis but:,"I have no argument with Dillehay's thesis but for the non-specialist the mind-numbing recitation of obscure dates (Before Present) and obscure locations is not enlightening.I suspect that his research that refutes the Clovis theory is correct and that those academics who are not threatened by this refutation will find it useful but for the non-specialist I suggest that ""The Zuni Enigma"" by Nancy Yaw Davis which speculates on some of the same theories for the possible ""Settlement of the Americas"" is much more readable and accessible.Also a minimally competent editor would have been helpful. On page 228 is the following statement: ""Although calculations are interesting, however, they are not evidence."""
4,Settlement of the Americas,The book is the correct blend of scientifc facts and interpretation. It methodically brings the reader through the basis for the current wisdom on the settlement of the Americas as well as providing a basis for a layperson such as myself to understand how this current wisdom may be ultimately challenged.
4,Great product - great price.,"This case is as good as any $30 case, and more attractive than most of them. Mine does not have any of the issues the previous reviewer identified. I have a Nano 2G - the case fits it snugly and locks around it. There are a few odd design choices to be aware of, however. First, as previously noted, the Ipod hangs right-side up (in other words, looking down at it hanging around your neck, it is up-side down, and therefore slightly less convenient to fiddle with). There is a rigid belt ""loop"" on the back, not a clip, so if you want to put the case on your belt, you'll have to actually thread your belt through it. Finally, the lanyard snaps together behind your neck like a necklace. The connection is snug, but it seems kind of pointless. Nevertheless, this is a great product for $4 bucks."
2,It's alright,It's a good idea but it does not allow you to use with theLanyard headphone set so it is not much use to me
2,Crystal Case for iPod Nano,"Although the case is lightweight and easy to use, I was very disappointed that the screen is not protected. I had no idea that a square would have been cut into the plastic case; if I realized this I would not have purchased it."
1,50 foot flat sewer rod,"This thing isn't worth having, it's so flimsy and cheap that i'm just going to throw it in the junk pile! Don't waste your time and money, it's not worth even trying to use. very disappointed Joe Crocker"
3,Works as hard as you do,"3 1/2One of this maestro of minimalism's most surface-level repetitions, though also one of his most rewarding. He's worked close to these themes before, but rarely stayed as committed to intellectual endeavors the whole seventy-five minutes long. The result is a work that gives out as much as it gets in- put it on in a meditative mood and the tonal transitions will near profound, but listen to it casually or from an analytical viewpoint and shallow frustration may occur."
3,"Sabri Brothers ""Ya Habib""","I was somewhat disappointed by the quality of the 27-minute version of Saqia Aur Pila. The 10-minute version at the concert in Abu Dhabi which is available on YouTube for free listening has so much more energy than this one. Also the inclusion of the Punjabi language segment in this track did not do much for me. If you want quantity, get this. For quality, I prefer the other version.The other three tracks are so so.Sound quality is average.Anwar Hossain"
4,Thoroughly enjoyable page turner.,"Once agains Hunter turns out a strong, just minded, flawed hero. A perfect beach read in its own right made more enjoyable for Hunter fans in its continuation of the Swaggart family history and a blend of real historic figures and events."
5,"""Hot Springs"" a novel by Stephen Hunter","""Hot Springs"" a novel by Stephen HunterI especially enjoyed ""Hot Springs"" since I was born and grew up in Hot Springs. The amazing accuracy and knowledge of the city and other areas of Arkansas by the writer indicates a great deal of research. I am familiar with all the places and locations depicted in the novel. I knew some of the characters in the novel even though the names had been changed.. How the writer could be so accurate is much, much more than just looking at a street map. Stephen Hunter's writing style kept me in suspense and interested while reading the novel. Hunter's background indicates he was born in Kansas City, MO and grew up in Evanston, IL. There is no record that he ever lived in Hot Springs, AR.Spencer Moore"
4,A Manly Book!,Stephen Hunter offers plenty of sex and violence.Entertaining to my husband;annoying to me.
3,Pretty OK,"This was my first Hunter, after reading the review. It's a pretty good yarn, pretty well written, pretty well paced and well, overall, a little labored, but I read it quickly and pretty well enjoyed it. I'm also pretty well fed up with lousy editing that can't catch one or two glaring discrepancies in time (for example, on one page, a watch reads 6 p.m. On the next, it's 5 p.m.), the usual handful of jarring typos, and a gap or two in the action (how is it that Earl shows up for the final shoot-'em-up dressed out in Tommy gun and magazines when all that armament was taken away from him and he was spanked home hard by Hot Springs finest? Who was his supplier? We don't know). C'mon, boys and girls, pretty-up your publications before asking good money for them."
5,"Well, there went a holiday weekend...","Okay. Bought the darn thing right before the 4th of July weekend. Then I read it... Which meant I that then I had to go back and read the others in the saga... Argh! Should Mr. Hunter ever be in St. Louis, and desire a trip to a benchrest rifle club, where the shooters are after the ultimate in accuracy, I'll be happy to have him as my guest. Oh, and from what I understand, the average joe can't weld titanium (grin). Only goof I've ever seen in his books..."
4,Bullseye,Another page-turning chapter in the Swagger family saga is sure fire summer fun. Earl Swagger returns from heroic WWII duty to confront the demons in his past and the uncertain post war future. Hunter knows how to tell a story and keeps getting leaner and meaner.
4,The elder Swagger Hero rides again....,"The Mythic Figure Earl Swagger is back and subdues all the bad guys (including the Americans) in Cuba. This is a fun read but the plotline requires considerable willing suspension of disbelief. A guilty pleasure for me, I guess."
5,Swagger saga continues.,"This is probably the strongest of the Swagger saga, despitesome opinions to the contrary. The plot is tight and thestory flows effortlessly from start to finish, testament toHunter's developed sense of pacing and storytelling.I especially liked the post-WWII setting, in that Hunterreally places the reader in that time with simple touchesand some astute observations about things we take forgranted or never considered: Bell telephone, the life ofreturning veterans and war heroes, the social structure ofthe South and America in general in the late 40s, and so forth.Hunter did his research but he didn't let it get in the wayof telling a story; like any good writer, he just used it tohelp tell a better story.Call it a prequel, call it an addition to the Swagger saga,but call it your next Stephen Hunter book."
4,Stephen Hunter continues to build on the legends he created.,"Stephen Hunter continues to write in his multi-perspective style. This latest book is a prequel to Blacklight. In my readings, only Tom Clancy brings more in-depth detail to his characters and plots. He passionately and meticulously describes the locations, and the equipment used. The story flows very well, as is typical of the Swagger series books. He is able to intertwine characters and events from many books into one believable timeline. Personally, I like how he borrows characters from his other books and shows them at different points in their lives. Hunter allows himself the opportunity to expand on this series with future books. While doing all this, he tells an exciting story. A Hunter novel veteran knows that the hero will triumph in the end, but getting there is an adventure. It's just a question of how many bad guys will die at the hands of the hero."
2,Surprised by the Positive Reviews,"While Hot Springs isn't an awful book, it is a book with atrocious dialog, a predictable plot, and only a handful of interesting characters. In over 500 pages, I didn't find a surprise or a moment that captured my attention. Earl's nobility irritated, the stereotypical mobsters and molls were mere window-dressing, and the backwoods hicks were ridiculous caricatures.I will try others by the author as my wife swears that this is the worst of his books, and I generally trust her taste. For me, though, this was a disappointment. I can forgive a story that lacks originality if the writing is compelling; this isn't that book. Before I give Mr. Hunter another go, though, I'm going to retreat to my world of Paul Theroux, Sean Stewart, and Victor Davis Hanson."
2,Might have been a good comic book,"Let's be honest: S. Hunter may be a proficient professional writer with a commercial following, but this book is... The mob characters are all paper-thin cliche figures. Earl Swagger dominates every physical encounter with the powers of a super hero. The writer takes an interesting subject - Hot Springs - and turns it into cheese.Are all Stephen Hunter's books designed for an adolescent male mentality like this one? This was my first. It will be my last."
3,o.k.....,I enjoyed her own personal odessey better because I felt this was just basically a copy of her book but smaller with details taken out of it.If you are wanting to read a small book then this book would be good.If not then read her biography 'She Got Game' : )
2,Meini Nino energy chimes small,I like the price but it sounds a litty tinney. I am using it to start class and get everyone's attention. So it works fine for that.
5,"One of the greatest ""folk-rock"" recordings of all time","At last...Peace on You is available on CD. Unquestionably, one of the greatest of the folk-rock genre. There are few albums where every song holds up. This is one of the few. Ironically, this album never got the acclaim it deserves. Lots of 12 string, great arrangements, great vocals, a lot of variety and full of the signature sounds that make McGuinn a rock legend. This album is a must in every folk-rock lovers collection!!"
4,"Sexy, entertaining read","I'm currently writing a novel for Harlequin's Blaze catalogue, and so I've decided to familiarize myself with said catalogue by reading its installments. Cathy Yardley's Working It is a fun, romantic romp about a go-getter PR agent and her reluctant client. Jade Morrow wants to land a promotion, and the only way to achieve that is by helping Drew Robson's troubled company. However, Drew isn't keen with the aforementioned idea. Sexual tension rises during a road trip, and Jade gets more than she bargains for with Drew.What I like about this romance line is that it is as feisty and provocative as it is fun and romantic. Perfect for sheer romantic escapism! Also, Cathy Yardley is a wonderful contemporary romance writer. I liked L.A. Woman, her Red Dress Ink offering, and I also like this one. And I love Blaze. I look forward to reading more books from this series."
4,Thick but worth the effort,"I've been Eucerin for a few years now for extremely dry skin (flaky, itchy and not conducive to going without sleeves or in shorts/skirts). It's very thick so you need patience to put it on and to wait for it to be absorbed before you get dressed, but it is so effective that it's worth the effort. It has virtually no smell which is great if you wear perfume. I would have given it a full 5 points if it were a little easier to spread on your skin, but don't let that put you off. As I said before, it's worth the effort."
3,Can't beat the Ballads,"Well unfortunetly i can't say very much for the upbeat songs on the CD. But the 3 ballads, You Are, Longer then Time and Got to be wherever you are, are worth the cost of the cd alone. They are very good with love ballads. Especially, Got to be wherever you are. That has a serious 70s flavor sound to it. Just like on their previous cd, the song Taste of your love is a definite winner. My advice to them, give up on the dance tunes and stick to the Ballads. That's what they're good at."
4,crescent pot strainer,"RSVP Endurance Crescent Pot StrainerI have a rubbermaid pot strainer similar to this one. It is about 40 years old. I have been seeking a new one, and several friends have asked me where to find one. Besides serving as a pot strainer, the opposite edge of my old rubbermaid tool is straight, perfect for leveling dry measuring cups and even measuring spoons of flour, sugar, etc when baking. I love this strainer, but it would be perfect if the opposite edge were straight. The rubbermaid model was designed for leveling (as well for for draining). The leveling side is even reinforced about a half inch from the straight edge. I use mine almost every day for cooking or baking."
4,Great!,How much can you say about a pan strainer? Ha! We love it. It does it's job and didn't cost a fortune!
5,This is a great product,I found a left handed strainer in my Mother's kitchen and fell in love with it but it was hard to use as I am righthanded. I looked all over for one and finally found this one on Amazon which is a right or left handed utensil. It is great when straining grease from a frying pan or liquid from any large pot. I've been cooking for 35 years and wish I had one of these from the beginning!
5,Super handy,"I've used this on my largest pots and smallest bowls, for draining anything from boiling on the stove to defrosting in the microwave. This is a great tool to have on hand, seems well made, and is very versatile."
5,great replacement for a colander,"This is an awesome product that makes straining anything you cook quick and easy. This Stainless Steel Pot strainer is so well made and durable! It is fairly large, but gets the job done quickly with half the clean-up! This is a great gift item as well! (my husband loved it)"
5,Great strainer,"Very sturdy and durable strainer. Great for draining liquids from skillets. I could never find one of these in stores, but finally found it on Amazon."
2,"Sorry, didn't like this item",I had an old plastic Rubbermaid crescent pot strainer and loved it. My grand-daughter used it while she was at our house. She loved it so I gave her mine. I searched for another Rubbermaid one but to no avail. I then saw this stainless steel one. It is sturdy but narrower & heavier than the Rubbermaid one. It tends to slip off the pan for me most of the time. I donated it to the thrift store.
4,Works as advertised,"Not much to say. I've used about 4' of this and so far it works well. Its more heavy duty than I thought it would be, that's a good thing. Takes labeling well with a sharpie."
3,continuous roll vs bags,"I like the continuous rolls but find that the slightest uneven edge can give problems when sealing food items. With the precut bags, there are no uneven edges to have to deal with and you are less likely to waste bags."
1,Not a bargain,"You can get a better deal at Wal Mart by buying their ""extra value pack"" for the food saver which has 3 rolls of 11"" x 18' and 2 rolls of 8"" x 22' for about $40."
1,I never recieved this item!,"I can't review this item objectivly, because I never recieved it. I haven't recieved any explainations from Amazon, either.I have used these for packaging fish and meat in the past and the textured bags allow better air flow when packaging."
2,Be Cautious when ordering this product,I had difficulty sealing the bags with this product. I called customer service and ordered new seals which took care of the problem. Customer service told me this particular Food Saver is and '06 model and I should take care not too lose the receipt for the first year. I am inclined to believe this Food Saver may have been defective & refurbished.
2,Avoid these bags - they are not FoodSaver,The title of this product is misleading - FoodSaver is a trade name not a product name. I expected to receive bags made under the FoodSaver brand and instead received FoodShell (whatever that brand is) which are inferior quality. The material is thinner which detracts from the quality of the seal. This is the first time that I have been fooled by an Amazon product description.
5,Nothing like a FoodSaver,These bags are durable and work everytime. I like the size which seems hard to find locally.
5,Prosonly,"I have been purchasing these rolls for years, and you just cannot beat the price. I use my food saver everyday for a multitude of things, and I use literally thousands of bags yearly. This is by far the best price guarenteed you can find anywhere! I invite you to check them out, you will be very happy with the price! Thanks again Amazon for providing us with a great product for a great price!Prosonly, a weekly shopper on Amazon.com"
5,Great new book.,"Your book is excellent. Seriously, click purchase right now! This book explains everything in an easy to understand way."
2,FrontPage(r) 2002: A Beginner's Guide,"I was persuaded to buy this book after reading the reviews (...) and also the fact that it received 5 star ratings.However, I was disappointed to the fact that it had so many typing errors and I don't think it was well written. I only read the first 40 pages and decided I have had enough and will return the book."
2,Needs to be reworked.,"This is not the best written book. I am learning a lot of stuff about FrontPage 2002, but I while reading the book I get the filling that it was by more than one person. Sometimes the 1st person is used, sometimes it is not. The steps in the books are not always clear and are overly wordy. Some of the steps seem to over explain process that had already be explain earlier, almost as if the author did not realize he had already explain them. You can learn with this book, but unless you're buying it at a very discounted price, by some other book."
2,Not Good,"While this book is good at providing an overview of all of the features that are contained within FP, do not even try to use it as a reference book. The steps are so geared to his specific downloaded examples that you cannot translate the steps to whatever you are working on. More theory and less ""...and now do this..."" kind of content would have been way more helpful. The number of typos are extraordinary - here is my favorite ""...you can set an included page with the text Welcome to automatically change to Merry Christams on December 31."" Merry Christmas, Mr. Channathambi!"
4,DARNED GOOD,"Good songs, different vocalists, demo's with new guy, nice mix. Interesting booklet, the history of Zao. 60 minutes of pure clean christian hardcore, metalcore, whatever, heavy metal? Okay. Support Zao, buy their cds, they are amazing!"
5,Legendary is right!. Zao with Ferret Records!!,"Legendary is a great cd, especially for the people who have never heard zao and would like to hear their best without buying all of the cd's. But to other news. ZAO's with Ferret Records, and I couldnt be happier, because we all know, or should that bands that are with solidstate seem to be limited in publicity and production quality. Now the production part isnt too bad, but you can tell the difference between a Killswitch Engage cd and a Zao cd, Zao's music, mainly the giutar work is pretty distant, where as killswitch with ferret, now with RR, is up in your face loud and heavy. So Ferret Records will be a great way for Zao to unleash like the beast of a band they are, while they lead the first ever Ferret Records tour! When the cd hits stores in July, we will all witness the Re-Bitrth of ZAO!! To hear more about the new material check out. www.zaoonline.com"
4,great glasses,"the canteen shape is not as nice as the 'pavina', but these are still very cool glasses.. who knew thermally insulated glasses could be so lovely?"
3,ok but very large for a shot glass,"these are great but I was surprised at how they are much larger than standard shot glasses. I should have noticed that it says 6.4 ounces! They are more like a small juice cup, much too big for espresso."
1,Not Microwave Safe,"I tried to heat some milk in the microwave with this, and the inside glass wall cracked. It is a very pretty product but should not be sold as microwave-safe."
5,hot's hot; cold's cold,"These little glasses work great. Keeps the espresso hot and the vodka cold. I don't dump them in with other dishes to wash them, they appear too fragile, but a little wash and wipe and they're back on the espresso maker."
2,"Nice design, misleading size","I own some of the larger Bodum glasses and have been pleased with all of them. However, these glasses are far too big to be practically used as espresso shot glasses. The review claims they are 3oz glasses, though they can actually fit 4.5 oz to the brim. A double-shot of espresso takes up less than half of the available volume. The outside of the glass itself is significantly more than twice the size of any other actual 3oz shot glass. The glass filled with espresso as shown on the box must be roughly 4oz of liquid.They are nicely designed and nothing is physically wrong with the glasses as long as your are gentle. They are perfect for espresso macchiato."
5,keeps the espresso hot!,"I received an espresso maker for Christmas but no Espresso cups. After using regular mugs and ending up with cold Espresso rather quickly, we decided we needed some Espresso glasses. These are very affordable and do an excellent job at keeping the espresso hot while we eat breakfast. They are light-weight, easy to clean, and cool to look at."
2,They leak,"I have bought a set of different Bodum Canten Double wall glases, and within the first month of light use water has leaked inside the double wall through the silicon valve, so some of the glasses have steam inside, or are full of water. It looks dirty and I am not using those anymore. I have tried heating the glasses to see if the steam leak out and its still not good. I really love the glasses so I have contacted Bodum in order to get an answer on how to fix the problem"
3,No page numbers,"This Kindle book does not have page numbers. The book does lay out the life of Christ very well. It has great section such as the Baptism, the Temptation, the Miracles and so much more. I love that each chapter has separate sections for each and explores each subject very well."
2,Just a Summary...,"Well, the subject is very interesting, so I decided to buy this book.. But inside, I expected to find the full story of great people.. but I found only 5-6 lines telling what happened.I read the whole book in 10 minutes.. And I think I could write it in a very short time. So a good idea and a good incouragement, but please improve!"
4,Do you have a problem with boating jargon.,When I started sailing I found the jargon hard to pick up. This book got me around all that. It is laid out like an illustrated dictionary and clearly explains all those confusing terms. You quickly learn that a lot of the people who use these terms don't really know what they are talking about. This is the ultimate bluffers guide for the sailor. A great book if you can find a copy.
5,Great movie,This movie is a must have for any WWII buff. It is a stunning portrayal of the Nazi meeting to decide the fate of the Jews in Europe. The acting is superb and the depiction of the people involved is very real.
4,Historic record,"This movie gives the viewer an insight into the twisted minds of the characters portrayed in the story. 100 % Accurate or not I don't know, but it's an eye opener to an evil side of mankind that should never be allowed to raise it's ugly head again."
4,Those Who Do Not Learn From History,Probably the most horrible movie I have ever watched. Extremely well done. The type of quality you expect from Kenneth Branagh. A must see for all students of history.
3,Interesting,"The Conspiracy is an English version of a 1984 film ""The Wannsee Conference"" by Heinz Schirk. The former is much better than ""The Conspiracy"". The Conspiracy speaks of the house the conference took place in as being from a Jewish family which is not the truth (it was donated by a loyal nazi to the SS, after the war all SS property was turned over to the Allies). The movie fails to take into account recent scholarship about Wilhelm Stuckart (who is portrayed as being sympathetic to the Jews). To see a better movie of this horrific event, one must see the 1984 version in German with English subtitles. The 84 version shows more accurately the personalities of those involved. It also shows accurately German military customs, discipline and uniforms. Still, if you can't get the 84 version see this movie but also read the minutes of the conference on the internet."
5,The Banality of Evil,"Nobody gets strangled, nobody gets slashed, nobody gets shot, nobody gets stabbed, yet this movie ranks as one of my favorite ""horror"" movies. Taken from an actual transcript of the meeting, this movie shows the banality of true evil. These 15 men take about 90 minutes to determine how best to implement the Final Solution. That solution meant the death of millions of people. Given that many deaths happened before the meeting in early 1942, we can still easily assign at least 4.5 million deaths to people at the meeting. That means 300,000 each. Freddy Kruger, Jason - you guys are slackers compared to these evil men."
5,As promised,"The DVD was in great condition (even though I purchased it as ""previously viewed"") and it arrived sooner than expected. Great overall experience!"
5,A wonderful record of one the most important events in human history,"This movie is a record of one of the most important events in human history. It is also the finest example of an animated documentary.In the late 1990s and early 2000s a group of Englishmen, recorded for posterity, the Art of English Rhetoric, in a series of movies - Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing, Othello, Conspiracy, Shackleton and others. I hope those who watch these movies will remember that they convey much more than the facts - they are an audio visual record of the history of the English Speaking Peoples."
4,"Beautifully done, but lacking in depth","The subject matter of the film is indeed important, the characters and filming is well done, but you leave the film with a feeling that there should have been more....more storyline. Basically in my view it is a dry film of the 2 hour meeting in which the SS and other Nazi party officials and military command put their heads together to agree on the ""final solution"" to the ""Jewish problem""....i.e. how to either house or dispose of millions of humans. Of course it was a tragic and cold blooded story, and the film does a great job of showing how the Nazis approached this is a mechanical/business-like manner, as if they were discussing how to meet the yearly quota for beer. However there is little else in the film, to add punch to the story. I think a different writer and director would have added something, to give it some punch...similar to Schinlder's List.....the more I watch this movie, the more I like it. I raise my rating to 4 stars."
3,Coldly brilliant,"The film documents a meeting held during WW2, when SS second-in-command, Reinhard Heydrich, assembles a group of Nazi bureaucrats and functionaries to 'discuss the final solution of the Jewish question'. In the sublime surroundings of a German country house, the assembled mingle for drinks, enjoy a first class buffet lunch and debate whether execution or sterilisation is the most efficient option of eliminating an entire race of people.Credit must be given to Kenneth Branagh who propels the entire piece with one of the best portrayals on screen in memory. He is utterly convincing in the role of a man who epitomises the classic definition of evil: not just the doing of wrong, but the perversion of the human spirit so that it no longer has any perception of the good.Overall this is an excellent film that benefits from great acting, a great script and great direction."
3,Hollywood Spoils It,I would have preferred this movie be made in German with English subtitles. It detracts from reality when Hollywood stars play Eichmann etc. Too bad.
2,Neither fact nor fiction,"Let's begin with the positives: the acting is superb, and the costumes and sets are surprisingly accurate (note the bronze swastika-emblazoned napkin holders being polished in the opening scene.) Now the negatives: as a film, it drags. It is the story of a meeting of bureaucrats; how could it not? As history, it is largely speculative. The minutes of this infamous conference, from the ""one surviving copy"", are barely 8 1/2 typed pages, including the list of attendees. Three of those who attended spoke on the conference after the war, when their recollections were somewhat hazy & their commentary geared towards pleasing their Allied captors. My point is there is not enough documentation available to build a movie on the subject of Wannsee. The director et al attempted to make both an entertainment and a documentary, and failed at both."
3,Solid movie!,Solid movie ! ther's no action just 20 members of the Nazi party and others talking at a table.I liked it.
5,Outstanding,"Exceptional acting, direction, and writing. Wastes no time to get to the core of the story of what took place at the meeting. Recreates, through the interaction of the meeting members, the gravity and tension of what was being discussed: the Final Solution. Outstanding filmaking and story telling.I went to the Wannsee Conference House outside Berlin in Spring, 2008, and the head librarian told me that the scenes outside the villa were shot on site, and that the filmakers measured the inside of the house so that the movie sets would be as close to the real villa as possible.Note: The ""story"" picks up immediately. There is very little in the way of history, background, or context, so, if you don't already know a little of the history, I highly recommend doing a little reading in order to get the most out of this film. You can get some of that by reading the Wannsee Conference posting at Wikipedia."
4,it's important to know what words mean.,"I lazily fell on HBO one afternoon and found this movie. I was enthralled similar to the way I was the first time I saw 12 angry men. How can a movie around lunch be so compelling? this is brilliantly acted and the cinematography is stunning. I absolutely deplore the topic and found this a most riveting movie due to the acting and intellectual justification for murder. I have read the Wannsee Conference minutes and there certainly was a tremendous amount of creative liberties taken with the script, but just the same, it was well done and I am drawn to it like a moth to a flame. I suspect the power of the performances is the greatest draw but I also think the topic adds a sureal and unexpected weight to the performances as only genocide could. I highly recommend this if for the acting alone. The dynamics between attendee's is amazing due in large part by some 1st class acting."
5,exceptional film,"In a time of movies like Saving Private Ryan and The Great Raid,HBO makes a film that is in its tradition of quality film making.Although there is no action and gore in this film,the story is every bit chilling as any war film could be. As an amateur WW2historian,I was well aware of the Wannsee conference. If you have ever wondered why the Nazis did what they did,this film demonstrates the rational the Nazis had for there madness. If you think that this film sounds boring,remember that more then 10,000,000 people died in the death camps(6,000,000 Jews) and this meeting made it Germain State policy. So take a chance,forget about Saving Private Ryan and watch this film. Remember,""those who forget the past are condemed to repeat it"""
5,The evil that men do...,"An utterly horrific and captivating character study of the mid-level bureaucratic personalities that put the ""Final Solution"" into motion. The politicking, hidden agendas, carrot'n'stick manipulations in this portrayal** of the Wannsee Conference are frighteningly reminiscent of boardroom meetings and other corporate management functions. Well produced and superbly acted, this film is a chilling case study into the ""banality of evil"". Highly recommended.** Presumably somewhat fictionalized - they do have a ""cleaned up"" transcript of the conference minutes, but I suspect the writers had to dramatize a bit here to fill in the gaps."
5,stunning tv,"Television doesn't get much better than this. A superb film with top notch performances with Branagh, Stanley Tucci and David Threlfall standing out. Do not miss this under any cicumstances."
5,FANTASTIC,This is an excellent character study. Lots of dialogue and lots of great... GREAT acting. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves great acting. I have watched it over and over.
3,Cute but...,"This set is cute and colorful and holds up well to repeated washings, however the fitted sheet shrunk so much in the dryer (even on the low setting) that it no longer fits the mattress."
5,Great Little Book,"This book was very informative both on ayurveda and it's treatment modalities as well as aromatherapy. I like that the authors gave a lot of real life experiences with the specific oils. There is also a section on rare oils and ayurvedic oils. There are many references to other resources of related material too, which are good as well. I was very pleased with the overall content."
3,Mel Bays Modern Guitar Method: Grade 2,"I am a professional musician, and I teach guitar part time. I believe that Grade 2, 3, and so forth are excellent introductory books that I recommend for anyone who desires to play a guitar while reading sheet music. (I would not recommend the additional grades for students who only intend to play guitar by ear.)"
2,Dont buy it,Hey. I started guitar a year ago and have used this book. It is not good at all. I know none of the songs I would like to no and I am not having any fun at all from using this stupid book. Im quitting this book and moving on to a better book because I havent learned a thing. If I keep going with this I will probabl quit.
1,Extremly Poor Product,"I have now owned 3 Professional II machines, one of which was repaired under warranty. All have failed with light to moderate use! All 3 ultimately failed to vacuum. I would have voted zero stars but that was not an option!"
2,Only works with Tilia Foodsaver bags,"This vacuum sealer works wonders, and I would rate it a 5 based on it's performance. The one problem is that you cannot use your own bags, so you have to keep re-ordering your vacuum sealer bags from Tilia. These bags are quite expensive, (and are patented by Tilia Foodsaver), and this vacuum sealer only works with them due to diamond shaped plastic featured on one side."
1,"Eneryone would buy one,if.","I would love to purchase this item,along with countless other people.It is just beyond the budgets of the very same people that it could help.A reminder to Tilia....The more people that can afford this product,the more would purchase.Sacrafice a litle profit and it will come back 10 fold in long term sales and profit. But as far as the product itself.This is the best on the market.A great design,and is on my wish list.(Along with a winning lotto ticket)."
5,"It's a risk, but a great product.","Just want to confirm that I'm not fond of the company itself, but the vacuum system works great. I've tried to buy accessories directly from the company and they ARE a pain to work with. Fortunately, I hadn't seen the infomercial, so I'm not disappointed with freezing things before sealing. Doing so is really not too bad. You simply line the container you'll reheat the food in with plastic wrap, spoon in the food, freeze it, remove the container and wrap, then bag and seal. I did it with baked ziti and it worked great. Shows that expectations contributes to half of satisfaction."
1,There Are Better Books Available,"I agree with Person. I have this book, and the drawings inside are very poorly done by someone who obviously knows next to nothing about horses. They are misleading and are cartoony caricatures at best.As an equine artist, one of my pet gripes is the number of how to draw horses books which are illustrated by artists who do not know horses well. How can you learn to draw a horse properly from inaccurate drawings and instructions.There are better books out there for all ages. ""Draw Horses with Sam Savitt"" is tops in my book and also the Walter Foster books are better."
1,"never looked at it, but listen to me people","For those of you who have never really been around a horse, I'd like to point something out. The horses ears are incorrectly placed, and I wouldn't go buying this book and open it to find a bunch of donkey like horses. I'm just warning you, becuse that's probably what you're going to find. And as for the people who HAVE been around horses for awhile, you should know about a horses anatomy and see that this is incorrect. Again, just a warning, I've never tried this book, but I've been around and ridden horses for 3 years, so I'd think I'd know where a horses ears go, and that's not where they go. Another thing; the horses eyes are too small, and the neck is way too short. Also, the horses upper lip looks like a chunk was cut out of it. Their upper lips are not that pronounced. Just warnin' ya..."
4,Great CD,"Really good cd, include the hit ""where you going now"", I think this band is one of the best hairmetal bands in the world"
4,Tex Avery Goes Nuts In Eight Comedy Classics,"Screwball Classics Two compiles eight of Tex Avery's MGM cartoons, each one piling on fast cuts, fast animation, and complete lunacy.Red Hot Riding Hood plays up the sexual undertones common to Avery's cartoons as it lampoons the famed fairy tail.One Ham's Family is a Christmas tale featuring an obnoxious young pig and a hungry wolf.Screwball Squirrel stars in Happy Go Nutty as he bewilders a pursuing dog.Bill Thompson is featured as Big Heel Watha, a fat Indian trying to catch Screwy Squirrel in order to win the hand of the tribe's maiden, Minnie Hotcha.The Avery chase theme is best shown in an early Droopy cartoon, Northwest Hounded Police."
5,You could do a whole lot worse.,"This is a beautifully written book! This is a great place to start and perhaps end one's study of boundary and eigenvalue problems. The first chapter even provides one of the best treatments of first variation I have seen in print. The vibrating string, heat conduction, PDEs, Fourier series,special functions, self-adjoint operators, it is all there and written in an easy to understand format. Some may find the notation a little dated but that is little price to pay for such a treasure of knowledge. Read and enjoy."
2,Overbearing and dreary...,"I'm disappointed to report that the first major Steve Reich work to appear in quite some time is a total drag. I hope his music doesn't continue down this dead-end path. The rhythmic and harmonic freshness and appeal heard in such brilliant and varied pieces as Different Trains, Music for 18 Musicians, Octet, and The Desert Music is distilled here into short episodes of watered-down Reich-isms. The spoken samples that were so seamlessly interwoven into Different Trains just sort of sit there in The Cave. And the socio-spiritual elements are totally overbearing, dragging the music down further. Steve Reich has always been one of my favorite composers...I hope he finds a way to develop his unique style more successfully in future projects. It's somewhat disturbing that the most interesting Steve Reich release in the past 10 years was all remixes by other artists. I think he should re-focus on the music and avoid musical-theatre concepts like ""The Cave""."
2,Uncompelling,This music is hard to listen to. Perhaps the performance was better. Fans of pop-minimalism won't like this CD set.
4,great running shoe,"First you put the shoe on, and you feel like you're walking on a cloud. You start running, and the lack of shock traveling up your leg into your back surprises you. Finally, as you're edging up into higher mileage, you notice that your feet are actually breathing and feel cool (instead of hot and wet). Best running shoe I've ever experienced. Worried how long it'll last, though."
2,Yaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwnnnnnnn,"I bought this movie because I am a fan of Maynard James Keenan. I am also a fan of hot chicks and muscle cars. All of which are served up in heavy doses throughout the flick. Regardless, I bairly made it through my initial viewing, and to date I haven't even considered giving it a second look. Save your money."
1,Where did my time go?,"This is 2 hours that you will want back so bad you will go looking for them with an automatic weapon. This movie makes you temporary as dumb as an army cook. It's funny and Maynard as the devil was cool to see. Hearing the pope (Dee Dee Ramone) say ""Hey, f*ck you Satan!"" is the best part of the movie, after that turn it off go watch something from A&E to get back the brain cells you lost."
5,Babelicious,"Babes in Bikinis and some hot cars, where can I get some... bikinis that girls wear that is? This movie is kewl!"
5,underated.,"This is probally my favorite cd of all time. granted it is not for everyone and is very late 80s in style. the song 'let an angel' that is on this cd is by far my favorite. I am still hoping she will make another cd. For the most part people will listen to this cd and not think about it again. but if singers like Tiffany, Debbie gibson, Expose and the like are your cup of tea then i strongly recomend listening to this one."
3,on demand download is not same resolution as DVD.,"I downloaded the on-demand version of this movie and it lacks the resolution of a DVD. FYI, in my opinion."
4,This movie is genious!,"My God, this movie really let one inside the mind of the Mob! The performances were stellar! Brando was great, and so was Pacino...Sure, the movie is a bit long, so those with no attention span go home! But the plot is great, and it should keep you hooked!"
3,Not the best version of this classic film,"I want to warn other fans of this film that this particular version is just the movie - those of you who are looking for any sort of special features or product enhancements should try another version of the film. If you want a good quality copy of the movie - okay, it's fine. If you are looking for any sort of value enhancement features - try the other versions and check the contents carefully."
4,a good story,"This is a great story, though its romanticization and glorification of organized crime gets a little ridiculous. It's a well made movie but it's excellent sequel is better in every way. Much better than the third film though.Ivan Rorick"
5,Watch this movie.,"The Godfather is a simple movie. It's so simple it approaches the level of Zen. It deals with very basic things: family, power, vengeance, corruption, strangers in a strange land, the aged king passing crown and sword to his son. It is one of the rare movies where each scene flows easily to the next. Nor do you feel that the director is building a story--it all seems inevitable and natural. It all takes place within the Corleones' universe, which exists completely inside itself--Old School, Old World, gentlemanly (on the surface), Catholic in its quiet ritual manner, boisterous with the family."
4,not bad for a 3 hour movie,i have never seen a movie with diane keaton so young but she has grown into a beautiful woman. she looks better now then she did in this movie. the movie is really long but it is well worth it. i loved the end of the movie when she looks over. and i can't wait to see the rest
2,"As with GodFather 2, 2 Stars Only.","Will start from the Begining EVERYTIME you Stop the DVD. Just like GodFather 2. Thought it was the Samsung Player, but today I have Panasonics Best Player and the results are the same. Will Start from the Begining every time it is Stoped."
1,Coppola is a money hungry mongoloid,".Hey Francis, take your restoration and stick it where the sun don't shine!!! How many different versions of the movie are you going to milk it for? We are onto all you money hungry mongoloids and we aint buying it any more."
1,How can this be one of the greatest movies ever made?,"I finally saw this movie with my family and after an half hour I was thinking of running out in the middle of rush hour traffic, that would have been more exciting than watching this all the way through...but I watched it anyway.Francis Ford Coppola is a good director but I think Apacoplypse now is a much better film than the Godfather.....I think mostly people just say its so great to go along with the crowd, but seriously I think this movie was too pretentious and boringIf you want a good movie about the mob, then go rent GoodfellasThat movie has all the violence swearing and drug use you could expect in a crime movie, except it has rich charaterizations, a hilarious Joe Pesci,a great storyline that will hold your attention to the very last frame, and an awesome 60's and 70's soundtrack that wont bore you to death like the music in the Godfather......This is a boring movie, please go rent Goodfellas"
5,not without fredo...,this movie is not remembered without fredo... let us remember fredo... thank you...
5,The Best Movie Ever,This movie is still the best. It's study of power is amazing. It shows that there is a fine line between big legal and illegal power.
5,What can I say- Magnifico,"I can't think of one single negative thing to say about "" The Godfather"". I read the book back in 1972 and was very impressed. Then when I saw the movie the next year I was happier still. The acting was superb(especially Marlon Brando) , the screenplay was a virtual copy of the book, and the editing was fantastic. It easily deserved every Oscar that it got in 1974. I have since seen the movie several times since 1973 and would see it again tomorrow. If you purchase one movie, this would be the one."
2,Great Movie! Crappy DVD!,"I love this movie.But I hate Paramount for treating such a classic this way. This editon of THE GODFATHER is one of the poorest transfers to DVD that I've ever seen. Light and color levels fluctuate like a bad 60s acid flashback. Trash and dirt specks fly through several scenes like swarms of insects.There's a Coppola commentary, but no other extras. And I can live without too many extra features, as long as the movie itself has been remastered with respect not only for its artistic merit, but also for its intended audience.Do NOT buy this DVD, unless you're willing to view the movie as it would be seen through a tank of murky water. This is an insult to every fan of this movie, and Paramount should be very, very ashamed."
4,NM Praise,This is an excellent entertainment. Each story in the plot and each character contributes to a complete picture of a time and place.
4,A Classic!,"This movie is a classic.It's right up there with Scarface,Carlito's Way, and Good Fellas.Marlon Brando is brilliant in this movie.Al Pacino has true""StarPower"" in the movie that you can't deny."
1,Don't rent this film...from Amazon,"The Godfather is a classic, and a wonderful movie. The quality of this film from Amazon was HORRIBLE. I have high-speed internet service, and streamed it on a fast computer, but it was like watching a scratched DVD, and the audio was off. Watch on Netflix or rent BluRay...or even VHS would be better....."
2,A Boring Hype,"I dunno why everybody likes ""The Godfather"" somuch. It's a boring hype, with not enough action.... just because of the cast."
1,Why is this still being made on VHS,"That one star is for the format, not the movie. VHS is past it's prime and why a movie of this statue is being put out on it is beyond me."
1,What is the big deal?,The most over rated movie of all time. If you want to watch a good Al Pacino movie then watch one of his other movies.
1,The most overrated movie ever made!,"I did indeed sit through all 57 hours of the Godfather and not only is it one of the most boring movies ever made it's completely pointless garbage. I have no clue why it's considered the greatest film ever made but then again most people are dumb so yea no suprise. The only good thing about this film is the music, if you haven't seen it don't buy into the hype that's all it is hype... BUT if you have insomnia put this movie in you should be asleep within the first 30 minutes."
4,I'm 26 years old...,"...and I saw the first Godfather for the first time today. Of course I've ""always"" known about the famous trilogy -but for some reason (perhaps because these movies are so long) I haven't taken time to sit down and watch the entire collection (I'm a great moviefan by the way).It's not like it's the best movie I've ever seen, but now I can sure understand its' reputation. Without doubt it is a masterpiece, Brando and Pacino are great and unique for their parts. It's a movie one shouldn't die before've seen (if you get my meaning), so realistic and engaging. And despite its' lenght it never becomes boring though there's not much action, it's mostly pshycological -and brutal at the same time.Give it a try, Coppola wont let you down -I guarantee!"
2,restoration--what restoration?!,"I am a Godfather fanatic. I have 2 VHS sets and the DVD set. I bought the Part I restoration the other day. I can't believe how disappointed I was! All they did was lighten the picture, which I could have done with my TV remote control. I am extremely disappointed with the so-called restoration."
4,slightly disappointed,"Like it's counterpart ""GODFATHER II""; while the movie is fantastic, it is not a restoration. The missing parts are still missing. This is basically the version aired on quality television stations such as TURNER CLASSICS."
5,Family Life the Coppola Version,It's always nice to view a motion picture the way its creator intended. The film is slightly different from the cinema we've seen since 1972. We must be glad that the extra footage does not sleep with the fishes.
5,Simply one of the greatest films of all time,"There is not much to say about this movie except that it is pure genius, every single moment of it. It more than lives up to all the praise it has gotten over the years."
3,Sad to see the packing of such a master piece...,"I bought I & II on bluray and the first movie came with no hard paper cover as the number II, thus giving the plastic cover a already worn out look. Pretty disappointing packaging wise... About the bluray superb quality and the all time masterpiece the movie already is... Well, just a delight!"
2,recall time,"Terrible, terrible transfer. Until Michael gets to Sicily, anything white is complete digital burn out. If FFC is going to put his signature on this restoration, he must insist on better quality control. Recall these, please."
2,Killing the blu-ray format ...,"This Godfather blu-ray is one of the worst video quality I have seen. It is a shame. If this can't be better so let in the DVD format. We want quality ! Reviewer at Highdef Digest must have seen a ""special copy"". I am shure it was not this."
3,The Godfather Blu Ray,"I saw this classic movie for the first time ever this weekend. The beginning gets you hooked although I feel it has a couple slow parts to it. Overall, it is worth seeing. However, I agree with another customer that the quality of this blu ray is so bad, they should stick with standard DVD until they figure out a way to make it better. I have seen movies from the 1960's that look fabulous like James Bond. However, this movie, although worth watching, needs a major overhaul in picture quality."
2,Streaming trouble,"One of 3 Movies I couldn't finish because streaming had trouble. Very frustrating. It was one of the reasons that I purchased Prime for. I got a refund on one movie.But I don't want refunds, I just want it to work."
5,classic!,This movie is a classic and one of my favorites. I think it's awesome to be able to watch it on my Kindle now.
4,Good movie - well acted,"This is an old classic, high action, and the acting is good. I read the book before watching the movie and that was beneficial. If I hadn't read the book first, I recommend watching the movie twice because it moves fast with a number of different story lines."
4,.,"I saw this classic only recently, and although I doubt it lives up to all of the worship it receives, I wasn't exactly disappointed. Superbly acted, stylish, involving, generally well-made, and rather dark film. The thing that most struck me about the movie was the evolution of Pacino's character, which, although a bit inexplicable, is chilling and interesting. I very much look forward to seeing the 2nd and 3rd parts."
5,Best Movie Ever,After I saw The Godfather I relized what true acting and perfection was. Marlon Brando is pure genius and Al Pacino is outstanding. This movie sets the standered for not only gangster flicks but all pictures.
5,Deserves all the praise it gets,"This is one for the time capsule.It seems to look better every year. The performances are stunningly good (Brando, Pacino, Duvall, and Caan were all Oscar-worthy here), the script a genius retelling of the epic novel, and Coppola knocks it out of the park with his flawless eye for framing emotions.Inspired in every sense of the word, The Godfather is peerless, except for Godfather 2, which is somehow almost as good (and where Pacino enters the Pantheon).The music, the colors, the darkness and chiaroscuro, the overall feeling of being in the midst of greatness on every level...this is what moviemaking can be. The bar was raised with this one, and in some ways only Apocalypse Now has topped it since.Coming on the heels of Coppola's incredibly dull The Conversation, this film seems even more miraculous. G 1, G 2, and Apocalypse, all in less than eight years; how many directors have had a hat trick like that?"
5,The Godfather,"I have always found this film fascinating. It is a character study of Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone. In the beginning he is wise to his family's business and all that it implies but clearly wants none of it. As the film progresses you can study him and watch him become the mafia Don --- to borrow from Star Wars -- he is seduced by the ""dark side"". A fascinating story with fascinating character studies. Watch the entire saga beginning with this film."
5,The all-time greatest movie,"The Godfather is probably the greatest movie of all time. Built closely around Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, the movie captures quite brilliantly the transistion of power from Don Vito Corleone to his son Michael. Perhaps this is one movie that follows the book almost page to page. Some of the dialogues are exactly the same.This film also saw the best of Marlon Brando, and the first of some sterling perfomances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall.Just like the book, the movie will keep you tied to it, it'll give you a hangover that's too good to beat.Two last words - 'SEE IT'."
5,Oh yeah baby,"Easily one of the greatest ever made. That music, that scenery, that acting. And those terrific close ups on Pacino's dark, brooding eyes...Mmmm. That man is very sexy. Classy script, great dialogue and famous one-liners. ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"", etc etc. A bit hard on the arse (over 3 hours) but a definite must-see."
3,Movie is Fantastic but...,"do not buy just the single DVD of Godfather 1. it comes with no extra features. if you're interested at all in any extra features, just suck it up and buy the three pack of the whole trilogy."
5,"The original ""family values"" movie. . .","Anyone who thinks this movie is merely about ""the Mafia"" is missing the point. It's about honor, courage, loyalty, trust, and love, and how a good son makes a bad choice because he loves his father and wants to protect his family. The gangster theme may draw some to see it, but these more important concepts -- not to mention Coppola's excellent directing -- are what make _The Godfather_ a classic."
5,"A good ""family"" movie","This flick is simply classic... no other words do it justice. I had seen a bunch of gangster movies before I saw this one, and I realize they are all just pale reflections of this masterpeice!The soundtrack was pretty good, the story was told excellently, and the ending was awesome!This is a movie, you simply cannot refuse!"
5,An All-time Classic,"One of the best films I have ever seen with a lot of memorable scenes and classic lines. On top of that probably the best directing ever and a perfect cast.Don Corleone, I honor you!Memorable dialogue to the last word (Michael is it true? No!)."
2,An Offer you should refuse.,"I'm very disappointed in the Blu-ray version of The Godfather. The picture quality, compared with the DVD version (which I also have), is very bad -- it is noticeably darker than the DVD - so much as to make it almost unwatchable. Parts are also very grainy (pixalated?). The color is super saturated, adding to the darkness. This is certainly not what I expected when shelling out for the Blu-ray edition. It is not worthy of the description ""Restoration""."
2,Soundtrack not synchronized with lips,There are sections of this DVD where the sound of the actor's voices are not synchronized with the movement of their lips.
4,great ending terrible beginning,i loved the ending every time i see this movie. when kay looks over it just so perfect. it was kinda long and a lot of people died in it but over all it was a good movie
2,I was some what disapointed....,"...with the movie. I went to the store last night, and baought it, came home and watched it. As I said, I was disapointed, espeacially after reading such good reviews on it. I found it tedious and overly long, espeacially the wedding at the beginning. Nevertheless, if you're looking into this movie, then you're obviously interested. But before you buy it, rent it and figure out for yourself if it's as good as everyone claims, and if you dont like it, then you've saved your self a couple bucks, if you do, then e-mail me, and you can have my copy for 10$."
3,To bad no Joe Pesci,"This movie would have been better if Joe Pesci had been in it. I think he is one fine actor. Still good though, but I really think Goodfellas was better. If anyone actually beleives this, please hurt yourself. THIS MOVIE RULES!"
3,The Godfather,It didn't work in one of my dvd players. It did work on my laptop and sister's dvd player. For this reason I'd give it 3 stars.
5,Superb!,"This movie is one of the very very best ever made. Its only shortcoming is that it glorifies organized crime. Still, it's a movie nobody should miss."
2,Disappointing,"Pretty packaging and useful box, but the reason for purchasing was for the scent.Only lasted 24 hours. Very disappointing. Would not order this product again."
4,boogie-woogie barnburner,"""De Styjl"" is one of the great postminimalist, postmodern pieces. It combines funky horn riffs with boogie-woogie piano, and a bizarre choral overlay that somehow all works together. There is an almost Ivesian feel to the way, for example, the brass chugs away as the chorus seems to be off in a different harmonic world moving at its own rate. A whacky spoken interlude concerning Piet Mondrian (whose painting inspired ""De Styjl"") brings the work to yet another unexpected place and the whole thing finally gives way static series of isolated chords that wouldn't seem too out of place in the music of Luciano Berio, Andriessen's erstwhile teacher. The performance is committed but perhaps could, at times, swing a bit more.I wish I could say something more positive about ""M is for Man, Music, and Mozart."" The music is, I think, trying to be charming but it ends up simply being cloying. I'm not qualified to judge the performance here which seems to be intentionally rough."
4,music book,"The service was good, the book was a bit more worn than I expected but still very usable. Pleased with it."
3,covers all the bases,"The surprise of this disc is that A LOT of it is good. Where most compilations suffer from the one hit wonder disease, there are a ton of killer tracks. Mr. Smiley (by Mustard Plug) is my favorite ska track of all time. Another surprise is that the songs didn't all come out within 6 months of each other; there's actually some variety to it. If I were rating only disc 1, I'd give it 4 stars, but the second disc is a bit weak. Other hilights include Hoosier Love, with such timeless lyrics as ""...gettin laid at Dairy Queen"", and Big Haired Girl."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"My experience with this product was COMPLETELY NEGATIVE. It did NOT erase the hard drive data- instead it erased the Windows operating system. The data was still on the hard drive, but the computer could not be started again. To dispose of the computer I had to remove the hard drive from the machine and destroy it with a sledge hammer. I did not need useless software to destroy the drive. this software does not work and causes additional damage to the computer.This company's customer service is even worse than the software-- consider yourself WARNED!"
5,Did the job completely,"The software worked for me. The software comes with a 30 day money back guarentee from the manufacturer, Nova. It also comes with free telephone and email tech support. If it didn't work, why would they offer a money back guarentee and unlimited support?"
3,Doesn't work with SATA drives,"I tried using the erase boot disc on an old laptop and a new desktop. It worked perfectly on the old laptop. Easy to use and did the job (5 stars). It didn't work at all on the desktop. I contacted Nova's customer service, who replied quickly (w/in 24hrs) by email. This was their suggestion.""Hello,Thank you for contacting Avanquest Technical Support.Try going into your bios and changing the Hard Drive mode for SATA to IDE. You might need to contact your computer manufacturer to find out how to do this.Thank you,...""Messing with the bios to wipe the drive sounds like a risky suggestion to me. I think I'll wait and find a product that works with SATA drives."
5,Excellent Product,"I was very impressed with the results using Drive Erase Pro. I wish there were more products out there. I had Windows Vista on my new computer, and wanted to install Windows XP. this seems like the only program I could purchase to remove Vista. Just by following the simple instructions, I was able to remove Vista. I notice several people complaining about this wonderful product. It worked great for me!! I guess you always seem to find people who complain just because they like to. lol I recommend this product to do exactly what it says it will do. It did for me."
1,What a waste of my time,"I bought this so I could completely erase the hard drive on my old desktop before I donated it.The Boot CD is supposed to erase a hard drive in 3 easy steps. It flat out does not work! I spent several hours trying to get it to work and trolled the web for suggestions. I changed BIOS settings, rebooted numerous times, tried the DVD and CD drives...nothing worked. It's supposed to be as simple as ""1. insert the Boot CD into your CD-ROM drive, 2. restart your computer, and 3. delete your data with confidence."" NopeSo then I tried the other CD hoping I could erase most data since the Boot CD didn't work. The other CD prompts for serial number but rejects the one it came with.The 80+ page user guide had no troubleshooting suggestions for either of these issues.I ultimately downloaded DBAN for free and successfully used that."
4,Simple enough for a novice,This was a very simple process for someone who does not do this type of work on a regular basis. It took less than an hour to do the entire process and have my old computer ready to give to someone to use for their children. I feel very confident that all of our personal information is off of the hard drive.
3,Partially Disapppointed,"Drive Erase Pro did what it said it would do: wipe my old HD clean. But there was no flexibility allowing my to keep Windows XP on as an operating system. That was wiped, too."
1,Product ID key does not work. Manufacturer does not respond,I am very disappointed as the product key was rejected when attempting to register. Further to give the manufacturer a second chance I contacted them in writing on their form on their website and I have not been responded to! I even stated I would like to avoid an A-Z claim/ return but they apparently care *NOT* about servicing their product. Dont Buy.
1,This software is useless!,"Don't waste your money on this software. I purchased this software to erase a hard drive before donating the computer. I initially tried running this software from the hard drive after installing it. It would not run with all of the many little programs that Windows opens running. I then created a boot disk from the software and used it to boot the computer. It then said it couldn't erase the hard drive as configured, despite the fact that the BIOS showed that it was configured correctly for Drive Erase. I eventually purchased Webroot's Wndow Washer, which worked perfectly."
1,Works with old machines only!!,"This product is outdated junk. It is effective for machines that are XP and older, but not any of today's machines. Will not work with SATA drives (more than likely the computer you are viewing this with contains a SATA drive...). When you go to boot the disk up you will get an error message stating ""hard disk drive not found"". It is there and functioning properly it is just that this old school software is not compatible with SATA drives. If you call customer support as I did on 12/28/2010, they can not help you and openly state that this software was written years ago for machines that are now dinosaurs and that ""Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't"". That said, this software is out-of-date garbage. Take a pass unless you have an very old machine."
1,Another Return :(,Like some others the S/N for this product was rejected by the product. No product support on the weekend. Not in the mood to make an already difficult job worse by fighting with tech support issues. I'll be returning this to the makers for the full refund. I bought WiveDrive System Saver and will not have to reinstall the OS which will be a good time saver.Forget this program and try a different one. This was a waste of time.Disappointed.
5,Well Writen & Enjoyable,"As Isobel (Izzy) looks back at her 99 years, she slowly realizes her life has been anything but plain, the way she perceived herself. Her son Thomas fades in and out at her side following a stroke, but so do her best friend, her daughter, and others long gone. She and Thomas discover a clearer awareness of their love for each other. She understood clearly when Jack taught her that it's the small things you need to see. This well-written book kept my interest all the way through, with descriptions that made me feel I was right there in the tailor and millinery shop; flashbacks to earlier times transitioned smoothly. I look forward to reading more from this author, Sarah Stonich."
5,these granite islands,I wondered when a really great novel would surface this summer. This book makes me believe that publishers still care about quality of writing. This is a marvelous debut novel but at the same time could stand toe to toe with more seasoned writer's work. Ms. Stonich is a breath of fresh air and a much needed voice at a time when quality work is at an all time low. I look forward to seeing more of her work. Her characters are believable and the story is sentimental and yet full of life. Ms. Stonich where have you been?
1,Very disappointing waste of time . . .,"After reading all of the glowing editorial and reader reviews of this novel, I had to ask my self, ""Did I read the same book?"" I found this novel to be nothing more than a poorly written, poorly edited, badly characterized melodrama masquerading as literature. I'm sorry I wasted my time with it when there are so many better books to enjoy."
4,grab this book,"This story, set in Minnesota, tells the tale of an elderly woman at the end of her life. She drifts in and out of conversations with her son and her memories of a special, unforgettable summer. This author is a great storyteller and I didn't want this one to end. The characters, relationships and conflicts are mesmerizing and I felt I really wanted to know this old woman and talk to her. It is truly one of the best things I have read in a long time. I expect we will be hearing a lot about this book and whatever she writes next."
3,Fluid and beautiful.,"Water. There are lovely, disturbing and peaceful images of water in this novel of love and friendship. Also this is about what it means to be a mother, even as you are dying and your children are old as well. Though an easy read, I found the sweetness and innocence of the main character refreshing. I also enjoyed the deep love two women can have for one another as friends in an age when women could not really share their hearts completely and openly with their husbands. There is some beautiful writing here."
5,floatation its the future..,I can't recommend floatation tanks enough and this is a fantastic and informative book[...]
5,"Life, Blood, Soul is captivating, but what type of book is it?","Malathronas' Brazil: Life, Blood, Soul is the best kind of book out there - I went in thinking it was going to be a travelogue of sorts, but it is that and so much more. First and foremost, Malathronas has the life I envy the most - exploring places outside the comfort zone, whether the big tourist cities or the often-overlooked locales. I've traveled to Brazil a few times, but the stories shared about the people of Brazil (and some of the tourists) bring a deeper understanding of who they are and what makes them tick. The history shared and the sites revealed make me want to buy a ticket and visit new places. Truely, it reads like the best book out there - the kind you don't want to put down, but if you do set it aside, you can pick it back up and not lose anything. Malathronas may be my new favorite author."
5,Great Alternative Travelogue,"John Malathronas achieves the right balance of memoir and cultural survey in ""Brazil: Life, Blood, and Soul."" If only all travel writing was so colorful! I read Malathronas's book on a recent trip through Brazil, and found that he answered many of my questions better than the standard Lonely Planet or Fodor's-type guides. In fact, the historical details that he wove throughout were far better than I had expected.I suspect that some readers may be put off by the casual sex and one-night stands that the author engages in (whose homosexuality plays a big part in this travelogue). Then again, he has a unique perspective and doesn't shy away from writing honestly about his experiences in Brazil. Highly recommended for those looking for an alternative to boring travel guides."
3,Be Careful!!!,"I just read a review that said they used the FoodSaver on mushrooms- NO!!! If you read through the product information on FoodSaver's website it clearly states to NEVER vacuum seal mushrooms, raw garlic, or raw potatoes. This is due to anaerobic bacterial growth (ie, bacteria that love no/low oxygen environments) and can result in life threatening botchulism! DO NOT USE ON THESE FOOD ITEMS!!!"
4,Great for DRY Foods!!!!,"Very effective for most foods. Have had lots of problems with veggies though. If you are like me, you wash your veggies before use/storage but beware, you will have a hard time trying to seal freshly washed salad greens and the like. We found that placing a paper towel/napkin over veggies before sealing will help. Take note, if product is used frequently in short space of time (20 bags in hour), product will stop working for some time. We found that we had to take 3-5 min. breaks between each seal so as to let product cool. Not recommended for meals like stew/soup."
2,Don't throw away your $$ - Mis-represented,"I was not happy with this purchase. The item is mis-represented in description. It talks about the accessories, but does not give you what is promised. Only 5 bags included - not 10. Also, only came with 1 roll of bags, not 2. When I questioned this I was told I could return the item since it was defective. I did not want to return item, just get the extra accessories. I was told that I wouldn't receive them. Maybe they should advertise this correctly, give you the promised items, or at least a discount for not delivering all items mentioned in ad."
1,WARNING - CAN'T USE IN HIGH ALTITUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I live in Colorado at 5960 feet about sea level. This product does not work unless you ship it back to the manufacturer for them to adjust at the factory. Wished I had known that before I bought it.
5,Life Saver,"I have found that the Food Saver has been a life saver for us, I can now buy in bulk and save money. It is only my husband and I home now, I just wish that I had this when the rest of the family was home. Our daughter was here one day and I showed her and her husband how it works and they went out and got one to, they love it also. For the lady that got one off of ebay, sorry it didn't work because you would like it if you had a good one!"
3,New or Used?,"I ordered the retail version from Amazon (sold from Target), but I believe that I received a used and defective product.I give the FoodSaver models 5 stars because they are amazing products and handy tools that I use for everything. I bought this because I needed a new one.I opened the package and there were scrapes and scratches on the FoodSaver. I really needed it at the time, so I just shook that off as bad luck that I received a previously returned item. When I tried to use the FoodSaver, it would vaccum the air out, but it would not seal the bag. Also, the vaccum motor would stutter violently and occasionally stop altogether.I have used FoodSaver models before and I highly recommend them, but Since this item is sent from Target and not directly from Tilia, be warned, you might get stuck with a lemon.The replacment seems to be working fine."
1,False Advertising,"Do not order this product on line if expect to get what you are paying for. The items that are listed as coming with this product you do not in fact get. I was extremely disappointed. I think the product itself is good, but the false advertising is not. Target did not go out of their way to help in the matter either."
3,Works well... until it breaks!!,"We got ours as a wedding gift over two years ago; wife loved the concept and thought we'd get much use out of it. The Foodsaver is handy and can prolong the shelf life of many foods; we used ours almost entirely when freezing raw meats and leftovers. Watch the video, practice a few times and you get the hang of it. Supplies can be expensive; re-use whatever bags you can.I would have rated this product higher; unfortunately ours decided to die tonight! The motor just gave up; we called customer service, expecting to have to RMA the thing for repair; unfortunately that's NOT an option! They convinced us to buy a newer model at what they claim was a 20% discount, but it's just as cheap elsewhere on the web so they did us no favors there. If this replacement dies again after two years of light use, I'll NEVER buy another Tilia product!!"
2,it's a drag,"My wife and I were excited after seeing the ads on TV, but after seeing the video that came with the FoodSaver 550, we realized that the vacuum sealing is much more involved than the commercials lead you to believe (duh).For starters:--Vegetables need to be blanched (boiled) before you seal them.--Sealing fresh meat is also problematic, given that the juices are sucked into the pump (the video suggests adding paper towels to the bags with meat to keep the juices from running into the pump).--Bread and meat should be frozen before being vacuum sealed.--The unit requires significant counterspace.--vacuum sealing stuff takes time, it's sooo much easier just to grab a ziplock.All that said, I will admit I had fun vacuum-sealing stuff in our fridge (whether it needed it or not). If you are thrifty and very frugal, you will enjoy this -- otherwise, I would consider the rational alternative: buying smaller portions."
3,Mostly Belgian Flemish recipes,My family is from Walloon and I was hoping this book had more recipes from that region. I was disappointed mostly because I was preparing a Walloon Belgian breakfast for 12 family members. It goes into a lot of history. I would have preferred more Walloon recipes.
4,Not your Dad's Axis & Allies!,"This A&A is a real-time strategy game with awesome game play and graphics and a learn as you play tutorial to get you into the line of fire quickly. This game is no pushovers! If you want to win a scenario, you have to use real tactics!"
1,Warning! Not the original board game!,"I have been playing A&A for about 10 years (as a board game). I also played the Hasbro PC game when I had Windows 95/98. This version of A&A is so unlike the original board game and Hasbro product that I found it incredibly distasteful! Don't waste your money on this PC version. It's a real load of crap. If you have never been exposed to the original board game, you may like it because you won't lnow what you are missing. If they had given the option to switch to ""A&A Classic"" then all would have been right with the world...oh well, maybe someday soon they will have another version that is like the real board game, which has to be the best strategy game of ALL TIME!"
1,NOT the regular Axis and Allies game,"If you are looking for the regular computerized Axis and Allies game, this isn't it. If you want a RTS type game loosely based on A&A;, you may like this.I wanted a regular A&A; game, so this game dissapointed me. The description wasn't sufficient to warn me that it might not be what I wanted."
4,Prelude to Copper blue,"Let's get something straight. This and and workbook came long before Sugar and Bob's post sugar work. That said, this is a brilliant shot across the bow. Sugar far more sounds like this than Hubcab and the Dog and Pong show....and now there is a new album, which I don't know the name of or have heard, yet. If you loved Husker Du or Sugar, this is a must to own."
4,An authentic Les Noces,"For those not familiar with the work, it is subtitled ""Scenes of Pagan Russia"" and is Stravinsky's portrait of several tableaus from a traditional Russian pagan wedding. I found this recordng years ago after performing the work with a mid-sized university choir. While our performance was correct, this one captures the ""pagan"" sound which, in retrospect, seems every bit as important as the notes and rhythms. Here we find an energetic, gutsy vocal sound which now seems inseperable from the musical structure. While originally orchestrated for four pianos and percussion, this recording is sequenced using computers, and it seems to work reasonably well (i.e. it doesn't come off sounding mechanical, but the tone is not that of real instruments). There is plenty else on this recording that is not Stravinsky but is equally exciting, all on the theme of Russian wedding music. This is the best recording of Les Noces that I have come across."
5,"Exciting, in fact electrifying","I could hardly believe my ears when I heard this, and played it three times over because it's so damned exciting. Then I checked out the other recordings by the Pokrovsky Ensemble and there's some marvellous singing and acting too if you see them on Youtube.This is intense, jazzy and overflowing with energy.Stravinsky's own version has been my go-to version until I heard this. I absolutely can't stand Bernstein, and this version makes it look bloated and pretentious (I'd even say ridiculous)."
5,articulately ugly,"This music well expresses ugliness.The word 'psychotic', seems to suit the sound of many of the tracks.There is no denying that most people would dislike the severity of this cd.The chaos is applied, however, with great detail (using chorus as the main, with countless traditional + classical instruments).'Atonal' is the classical term for the absense of key signature - The notes are all over place.The singing is especially akward sounding.The links this music has to Russian folklore are very confusing, but well explained in the (excellent) liner notes.This music's sound though, is like 20th century Russian classical."
5,Great memory card!,"This card holds a lot of space, and is still small enough to fit in my rio500. I have no experience with using it in cameras, but it never has messed up with my mp3 player, and is great in storage capacity. The only thing better is more space, and you certainly get what you pay for with any of these meory cards by San Disk."
1,Slow card and almost useless for digital cameras,"The card turned out to be horribly slow. The digital camera takes 4-5 seconds to write to it if more than 100 images stored. First we thought it was due to the size of the card, but having bought a viking and a crucial 64 mb compactFlash card we realise that it is not the size of the card, but the brand of card which is making the process slow.We later found following comparison which does seem to support our findings that the card IS SLOW..http://www.dpreview.com/articles/mediacompare/page4.asp?sort=cp995jpeg"
1,Too easy to order,A friend was browsing this item on my iPad. He isn't familiar with the iPad and ending up ordering the product to be shipped to my home in Florida. But I'm not in Florida for another 2 months so this is a real problem. How was he able to order without entering my password? Liver Biscotti isn't going to keep well on my front steps in the hot sun of southern Florida. I guess this is more of an Amazon problem than this vendor's problem. It is much too easy for someone unfamiliar with the device to make an order.
5,Hard to Find,I live in Va.and love to trout fish.I met with a game warden and he recommend this book.I looked everwhere and finally found it here.It has been very helpful!
1,This is an old edition,"WARNING -- WARNING -- WARNINGDelorme published a 5th edition in 2003. This edition (4th edition) is an older one. If you want the most currecnt edition you will need to look else where. This edition is copywright 2000 with information that appears to be accurate to 1999. New roads, etc not on this edition.Although it will probably be acceptable for many uses, just make certain that you are willing to buy the older edition."
2,Only shows major roads,This is an atlas for recreational travel. Most of the pages aren't the actual maps; they are listings of things like fishing spots. The map scale is useless if you are doing more than passing through the state on major highways.
2,"Neat idea, but WAY too fragrant","We have many allergies in our house, and the scent on these cloths is one of them. Would be great if these were fragrance free, but as is they are unusable for us and possibly dangerous to those with more severe allergies. Caution to those."
4,"Work well, but stink!",The wipes work well; they do not irritate my daughter's face. BUT they STINK!!!!! I usually use them before she goes to bed so that I don't have to smell her skin as it makes me nauseous.
2,Stinky wipes,"I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad."
3,"Good, not great","I used to buy these five plus years ago & was crazy about them. They smelled great, left no sticky residue & were perfect for quick clean ups. I just bought these for our baby & they left a filmy residue on him, still smell great but he felt like he needed a bath after using them."
5,Love Mustela,I love all the Mustela products I have tried. Great for adults with sensitive skin not just babies. These are perfect for plane travel with new restrictions.
5,trusted brand,great product. My daughter took them on a camping trip and I use them to remove make-up. They smell so good.
4,Very good album from Kevin Paige.,"I liked this album. It should have gotten more attention than it got back in 1989. This was very creatively done pop from Kevin Paige at the time. Anything I Want has that ""I'll do what I want!"" approach in the lyrics. There is a sense of optimism in the lyrics in most of the songs. Don't Shut Me Out the hit single, is one of the more standout dance numbers to come out of the late '80s. It's very inspired by Janet Jackson's dance hits, but it suceeds on his own. Paige has a strong voice here that dominates the dance numbers and the ballads. This should have gotten more promotion back then because Paige was a star waiting to happen. Guess the record label he was on didn't understand that."
4,Rain Forest by Helen Cowcher,"Cowcher has written a thoughtful brightly colored book about the rain forest for younger elementary aged students. It introduces the reader to the rainforest and the creatures that are living there peacefully. Sloths, aneaters, and tapis roam it's cool floor. Toucans and macaws nest in its canopy. And, high above its exotic foliage, butterflies flutter. As the Jaguar prowls his lush kingdom, a cry of alarm is sounded throughout the rain forest. Something even more powerful than a Jaguar is threatening this world, and the creatures know a change is coming. This is a great book for use as a tool to involve young readers in the issue of conservation of the rainforests, it is a powerful way to show the effects of deforestation to young children through the eyes of the creatures and plantlife who inhabit this ecosystem. (fiction grades K-4)."
1,One Star is a hundred stars too many,"This is the worst example of literature I have ever torutred my eyes with. I feel significantly dumber having read this. The picture on the front of the book is of his son, who by his own merit is very unatractive, however he pales in comparison to his parents ugliness. The general lack of genetic merit to the family is illustrated by the complete lack of literary talent. In summation do not read this book or you will be dumb and ugly too."
5,"No better way of ""Passing the time ...""can be found !","This wonderful book allows the reader to experience a place and a people now gone. The ""stars"" of Ballymenone come alive again in story, song and the descriptions of their lives by Henry Glassie. Unlike most academic books, this one is written by a poet...lyrical, powerful and evocative prose by a writer with suberb descriptive powers and spiritual impact. My husband and I recently visited Ballymenone and spent the day searching for what we had read about...but the people described are mostly gone, the landscape altered, the old replaced by new. For anyone who loves Ireland and wants to understand its ways and its culture this book is a must."
4,France: The Loire,"Talking about details! Everything you would want to know(and some you don't)about the history, chateau, architecture, accommodations, restaurants, etc. of the Loire Valley. A ""must read"" for someone wanting to get into the deep things-it is packed full."
4,downright spooky,"Like the concentrated energy of an atom, if this lengthy piece is condensed, note for note, down to 2.5 minutes, it sounds like Ike Turner's ""Rocket 88"" played backwards."
4,Kronos and Takahashi don't go together well,"Morton FeldmanPiano and String Quartet (1985) (79: 33)Aki TakahashiKronos QuartetRecorded: 1991NonesuchI like it. But I think Kronos and Takahashi don't go together well. Takahashi is good, Kronos is bad. I want to erase the sound of Kronos."
3,More than I expected,"I was afraid of this music and was hesitant to buy it. It sounded like your emotions when you have to walk through a bad neighborhood at night. I ended up buying it for far less than here and I'm pleasantly surprised. It's still a bit scary, but there is enough variation to pique one's interest and there are some beautiful stretches.This is indeed minimalism with a capital M. You can put it on and go about your business with it as a backdrop. When you do, you'll find that in the few seconds where your mind isn't busy, you'll hear this piece playing and you'll have a rush of familiarity and curiosity at the same time. It's new, it's old. It will all be different tomorrow even though tomorrow will be just like today."
2,Same Old,"Nothing new, same stuff as other programs. I didn't watch it all the way through, because I got bored about a quarter of the way in."
5,A Crude Awakening,Very informative and relevant in light of the rising prices at the pump. Americans need to realize that the days of cheap energy are over.We need to seek out alternatives that are renewable or face the day when we will run out of oil.
1,here's the problem,"many of the interviewees have been discredited in the past with their words and actions so it's hard to take this fear prop seriously. this was basically an excuse to put president bush in front of unhinged pinkos to make them crazy. is it wise to ween ourselves off oil? certainly. will civilization collapse tomorrow? no, no it won't. the crisis this film warns off will be manufactured by socialists and communists before a legitimate supply crisis will ever happen. they (democrats, progressives, socialists, communists) want the world to burn."
4,I still need help but my issue is between my ears and NOT this chess set,I have long wished to learn the game of chess - but easily get irritated with my lack of knowledge. One thing I really love about this set is that they show the range of moves on each of the pieces - although I still get a bit confused. I need more time and practice and have to ignore my husband's smiles while I struggle with this set...but I'm convinced that it is going to help me one of these days.
3,Arrived Missing a piece!,"I was pretty surprised to find that I was missing a piece considering the package was sealed. I contacted the manufacturer but have not heard anything back yet. My daughter really wanted to learn to play chess & I'm hoping they respond soon so she can start learning. Other than that, I like that the ""directions"" are printed right on the pieces. Helps a lot since my daughter can't read yet."
5,Chess Players,My son is six and caught on very quick to the game of chess. Makes it very easy to learn and remember which pieces can go where. Love it.
5,Terrific alternative to video games,My kids love this game and play it over and over. I have four children and it makes me feel great when this is their choice.
5,This was a great purchase!,"I was a little skeptical about this purchase when it was ordered but once we unpacked it and played chess the first time, I was convinced it was a great find and will help my special needs child learn and enjoy playing chess!!"
1,"OK, I guess","I had an ""Educator"" Chess Set when I was a kid. It looked just like this one. Big difference was that the pieces of that set were solid plastic where-as in this set they are hollow and open-bottomed. That set had a nice weight and feel to it. This one just seems cheap.I guess I got what I paid for. Used to be that plastic items where the mark of inexpensive/cheap products. Today, we wouldn't want you to have too much plastic-it would seem tacky."
3,"It is ok, I guess.",I don't think the learning part was necessary if you know somebody who knows how to play chess.
3,"Helpful to learn moves, but instructions are very weak","My 6 yr old son really enjoys checkers, so I thought he would like this game too. He does, but after just playing a few times we have run into a couple of situations where I was unsure of the rules, and the rule booklet did not help at all (i.e. my son's move inadvertently left his king open and put it in check, the rules do not say what to do in this situation). I had to look to the internet for the answers. The diagrams for the possible moves are quite helpful for my son (I have very basic knowledge) and he really enjoys the game, so I would recommend it, but I wish the manufacturer would improve the rule booklet."
3,Teacher needs a teacher,"In general, I would support Mr. Farr's product review.I would add the following observations: First, the photograph of the set shows an illegal position. It is not very helpful for the beginner player to be misled in this way.Second, Mr. Farr's review indicates that the pieces are labelled with their ""value"". Actually, it appears that they are marked with the number of squares that they may move. The piece value or strength would actually be much more valuable information for the beginner. It would be more helpful to know that you were about to make a bad trade of a Queen (Val:9) for a Rook (Val:5) instead of an apparently equal trade of a Queen (Moves:7) for a Rook (Moves:7).Nonetheless, this set may be helpful for the player who insists that they cannot remember how the pieces move. But only for a short time."
1,BEWARE,This game uses the invasive Starforce drivers. This form of copy protection causes a lot of issues on your computer including shutting down CD/DVD drives and often times barring you from a game you legitimately own. I purchased this game and had multiple issues related to the driver. It locked me from playing and would reset my computer at boot up. Finally managed in Safe Mode to figure out what was causing it and deleted the stupid thing. WASTE OF MONEY. Legitimate game companies don't need to resort to cheap tricks like that.
1,Stubbs the Zombie,Currently unable to review as my computer with XP is not working. Wish we could have it for PS3 or Windows 7
4,A evening of Brain eating Enjoyment,"I looked foward to recieving this game and I was not let down. I've always been a big Zombie fan and when I got the chance to see how the other side unlives I truely enjoyed it. The tongue in cheek style of this game fits me really well.The only let down is the camrea angles that can get confusing at times, butu once you get use to it you can adjust yourself to it."
1,STARFORCE !!!,"Great, another game I have to give to charity. I wish I would have read Jeremy's review before purchasing: haste makes waste.I know people who have had STARFORCE related issues. I've read forums where many have had problems with STARFORCE and had more problens when trying to remove STARFORCE. Plus, more drivers; another way for viruses to get into my computer.Maybe I'll learn to wait for reviews before purchasing ?"
1,ONE STAR TOO MANY,"You pay your money. You take your chances. If it runs on your computer consider yourself lucky. If it doesn't, don't say you weren't warned. My PC has run every major FPS from Doom3 to HL2 with no problem, but cannot even launch this game. Aspyr's tech support simply consists of telling you to download either a newer or older video driver. If that doesn't work, then too bad, or to use Aspyr's support terminology ""Resolved"". Seems ""resolved"" doesn't mean they got the game to run. It just means they stop trying. There are over 10,000 hits related to Stubbs error messages on Aspyr's own support site. Guess they're all ""resolved"" too."
1,incredibly bad,"this is one of the worst games i have EVER played, maybe the worst. even in really terrible games, i can usually find something good to say about it, but this one fails on EVERY single level. play the demo before buying. if you enjoy it, you have mental problems."
1,Games like this aren't Christian,"I'm a 552 year old elf, just using the kid's review because I'm tired of getting spammed after people read my real name at Amazon.This is the most horrid, evil, filthy unChristian game I've seen in years, and when I say that I mean that, cause I'm over 5 centuries old. Anyway, you play as an evil zombie that rips other people's heads off and eats their brains. That's it. I've played a full demo of this horrible game, and the whole time I was not only bored out of my wits, I was shocked and angered by the content of Randy the Zombie or whatever the name of this piece of crap is.Did you like this game? Well, somebody else liked this game too: Vladmire.Sincerely, Haldir"
2,"Cute bear, fake sounds","The bear itself is cute, but the ""womb sounds"" are extremely fake.Rather than a real ""lub-dub"" sound, the heartbeat is a single repeating dry knocking sound with an abuse of artificial reverb. And, other than the tail of the reverb, there's no background sound or acoustics resembling blood flow or a liquid-filled space. This is not only the least-realistic heartbeat sound I've ever heard; if I had listened to it without knowing where it was coming from, I would have never guessed it was supposed to be a heartbeat, let alone womb sounds.Don't underestimate your baby--buy this bear for the looks, not the sounds."
3,Dexbaby Womb Sounds,I cannot say how this works . I gave this as a baby shower gift and the parent has not yet delivered so it is something I hope will work for her . Looked ok in the package . Was something the mother wanted.
4,New Mother's Helper,THIS ITEM WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A NEW MOTHER AS THE BEST GIFT SHE HAD EVER RECEIVED FOR HER NEW BABY. BOUGHT IT AS A GIFT AND HOPE IT WORKED AS ADVERTISED!
1,Pricey!,"This bear is a really great idea, however, my son just didn't go for it. So now...all I have is a really expensive teddy bear. My boy is 9weeks old and we've had the bear for about a month or so. I bought the bear because I was desperate for something to soothe my baby besides me holding him. I thought if I could lay him down to sleep while he was drowsy that the bear may help him to go to sleep. Nope. Oh well, I tried. I just feel kinda sick now that I've spent so much money on what has turned out to be just a stuffed animal. Maybe when he gets a bit older he'll choose this bear as his ""security blanket"" and we'll get some use out of it. Or maybe if we have more children the next baby will dig it. We shall see."
3,3 Problems,Batteries were DOASound is loud even on lowest setting; I have to muffle the bear with a blanket so as not to be too disruptive in the middle of nightMine does not shut-off after 40 minutes... it keeps going; I finally shut off manually after 3 hours
2,"It's Cute, but....","The bear is really cute, but I can't say that it has helped my baby fall asleep. My son is 8 weeks old, I put it in the crib with him, but it doesn't help him go to sleep or stay asleep."
5,"This was a gift for a newborn, Mom says it calms the baby when cranky, it works!","I bought this for a gift. New mom just out of hospital, says like most moms that the baby has its days & nights mixed up, but the infant is about 1 week old now. Received the gift in 3 days of delivery. If mom says the ""womb sound"" helps. I am a happy shopper & excited that it works!"
2,Bear does not shut off,Bear does not shut off after 40 min like its suppose to and even on the lowest setting the fuzzy heart beat sound it makes is very loud. Gave it 2 stars only because a little constant noise helps my son go into deeper sleep as long as I turn the bear off as soon as he does or else it wakes him up.
2,baby hated it,"Stella hated this bear and screamed at it! Will try it again when she is a little older,and if not then it will just be a toy."
3,the timer does not work,Timer does not work at all. Volume has basically 2 settings high and very high.Would get more stars if it were cheaper.
4,Soothing for baby,"This bear works great to soothe my 8 week old baby. I can't get her to sleep without it. Only problem with it is that it does not shut off after 40 minutes like they said it would. Other than that, i definitely recommend this bear for anyone with a baby or even as a gift"
3,Transitional work for Glass,"Most critics agree that this is where Glass began a new phase in his career, eschewing hardcore minimalism for a more conventional neo-Romantic style. It has proven to be the template for his later compositions; they have reflected an increasing distance from the dramatically stark rhythms of EINSTEIN ON THE BEACH and taken on a softer dreamlike quality. It's not incidental that Glass chose the surrealist masterpiece LA BELLE ET LA BETE as the basis for his formal departure from the minimalist idiom he helped to create."
3,OK for late Glass,"I saw this work performed live in Chicago years ago, and bought the CD. I was lukewarm.I've long been a fanatic, mesmerized by the early Glass recordings, up through ""Akhnaten"" (and I saw the Ensemble live in concert a few times, and I even saw ""Einstein on the Beach"" live), but I never got so turned on by his subsequent works.Probably ""La Belle"" is one of the best of his later works. Maybe I'll eventually be able to get more into them in a few years."
5,So Cute,My daughter wanted a unicorn for Christmas so I got her this one. She loved it. The best part I think is that she can carry it around everywhere she goes in her own little carrier.
5,super cute,my daughter loves this unicorn and named her milkshake. for 10 bucks it make a really cute gift. well made.
2,Poorly made,My daughter wanted a unicorn for Christmas so I bought this one. I have sewn up twice since we opened it (3 days ago). If my daughter wasn't in love with it I'd send it back. Stuffed animals should be durable enough for a five year old.
3,Lacking Quality,"Sparkle is a cute and fun take along toy. Small, but not too small, Sparkle will make kids happy. My 5 year old daughter loves Sparkle. I do not love the quality of sparkle. Sparkle keeps having to be repaired because she comes apart at the seams. In fact, most of the Aurora plush toys we have come apart at the seems and require Mommy to play stuffed animal surgeon. Cute toy, but seriously poor quality."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the first book I have ever returned to Amazon. Not only does this account lack any analysis, it fails to contribute any new information about Hurricane Katrina. The book reads like a brief summary of news reports. I was disapointed with the quality and depth of the information."
1,Sleazy way to take advantage of a disaster,There's somebody who will take advantage of every disaster. This book is one way.
1,The book is fine - but don't get the kindle version,"The book is fine. It is a fairly technical review of the scholarship used to understand the parables, with some new insight from cultural anecdotes. The kindle version does not work well - the footnotes are hard to follow and the second half of the book is almost impossible to find."
5,An eye opener,WOW - cultural differences and contexts make us miss the real meaning of what Jesus was trying to say. Dr Bailey really brings truth to life!
2,Best and the Worst,I agree with others that say this book is the best. Unfortunately this book is the driest work I have ever read. One the other hand Mr. Bailey's videotapes are incredibly interesting and well done.
4,Beautiful exhibition,"After visiting Chihuly's exhibition at De-Young museum in San Francisco, Ca, we were looking for other chihuly exhibitions, and this one was recommended by a friend... it is beautiful show and a fine video, made us feel like we were at the actual exhibition."
1,Lust for the real IGGY!,"This is a regrettable Iggy album. Its all synths and new wave crap. I get irritated listening to it. Its embarrassing from the Godfather of punk. Get Bowie out of your life IGGY! For Iggy at his best, try ""Raw Power"" Beat Em Up"", ""Fun House"" or ""Skull Ring"". Leave this lame, Bowie induced, glam, new wave, queer junk in the bargain bin where it can fester forever."
3,Not a must-have.,"I am truly a fan of Iggy. One thing about his albums though is that they are either hit or miss for me. His style varies from one album to another, so everyone will have his or her favorites. Lust For Life is close, but not the most rocking album .... a few of these songs are just too repetative and lack the kind of raw energy that his really good stuff contains. Notably lame are the songs ""Success"" and ""Sixteen"". For my money, my first recommendation would be the albums SOLDIER and the classic NEW VALUES as must-haves. Get more bang for your buck. After Soldier and Values, get the album ZOMBIE BIRDHOUSE."
1,Awful!,"I loved Funhouse (especially), the first Stooges album, and Raw Power. This, however, is music to fall asleep to. Soooooooooooooo boring."
4,Great Album,"This is a great album, but at times Bowie's influence through the production and vocals overpowers the overall Iggy-ness of the album, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Bowie makes it come off feeling overproduced at times."
4,Great Muffler,I installed this on my 2002 Mazda Protege 5. This fit right into the existing bolt on exhaust system. The only problem was with the gasket (seperate item #31332). The Walker muffler does not have a recessed area on the flange that allows space for that gasket. I just used the gasket from the old muffler and added some high temp silicone gasket. Everything works perfectly and the new muffler is nice and quite.
3,A So So Book On George Benson Transcriptions,"Hello Folks....Unfortunately you will never find perfect transcriptions on Jazz Guitarists especially this one on George Benson. The transcritpions are somewhat inaccurate. For instance, for the Affirmation Intro there are mistakes on the tablature for the beginning 1st measure. The notes are not at the location specified in the F# Phyrgian Mode. I hope I'm not the only one that notices this. This is my observation so far and the chords for Bm7 are not accurate either. Guitar transcritpions are only used as an study aid and not for copying the artist style note for note."
1,fusongs,The book is great the CD was damaged So be careful I didn't use the book until it was too late for a refund or exchange (30) days
5,Perfect!,I have had these clippers for a couple of years. I didn't use them for much more than whiskers and bridle paths. I didn't change the blades up until this year. I used them to body clip my horse for the first time this week and they were fantastic! Quick and resilient. I LOVE these clippers! I even use them to clip fun quarter marks on my horse. :)
5,Wahl Equine Clipper,"I used these clippers to clip the hair off of my Elk hound dog. she is 11 years old and this Texas heat is about to kill her.It took a little while to get the job done, but for the money, it think they were a great buy"
3,Better video quality than the movie,"Phil Karlson made back to back movies with John Payne as a hapless film noir protagonist (the other was 99 RIVER STREET) and this is the lesser effort. I think this movie would have played better if the lead had gone to Preston Foster's crooked cop than Payne's fall guy, who goes from unlucky to stupid to clever to stupid again. And the naivete of Colleen Gray's character is hard to swallow. On the plus side, who can resist Neville Brand, Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam as the trio of baddies. The video quality is excellent as well."
5,Great Crime Story,"I acquired this title with an inexpensive Film Noir set I purchased a few years ago and finally got around to watching it. This is a great crime drama. I don't consider it noir in the fullest degree, like say, Double Indemnity or Scarlet Street, but it holds your interest. The style of masks the criminals wear were an interesting addition to the film - I highly recommend this one."
4,Kansas City Confidential,"If you love the old movies of the Silver Screen era you will probably like this movie. The movie has several well know supporting cast ""Bad Guy"" type actors. If you are lookng for high tech action forget this one."
4,FAST-PACED CRIME NOIR OF REVENGE & JUSTICE,"From 1952, this taut crime noir with its perfect cast has been widely noted as a prime influence on Quentin Tarantino's RESEVOIR DOGS.John Payne is Joe Rolfe, he's a reformed ex-con whose florist delivery van matches an identical truck used in a Kansas City bank robbery. Picked at random (fate is like that, you see) Joe is being framed by Tim Foster (Preston Foster), a bitter ex-cop who's the mastermind of the heist. Joe tries to clear his name and follows the trail to a Mexican hideaway and a confrontation with Tim's gang of bad guys beautifully played by Jack Elam, Neville Brand and Lee Van Cleef. Phil Karlson directed from a story and screenplay by a team of writers including George Bruce and Harry Essex. Don't miss this fast-paced thriller of revenge and justice now in a nice HD transfer."
1,hogan,"I received the cover for the movie, but no movie. I was frustrated because Im a kansas citian, when i opened the case there was no movie."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"My recent purchase of one of my all time favorite movies, ""Kansas City Confidential"" through Amazon.com was one of my wiser entertainment purchases. It arrived earlier than expected in great condition and the price was much better than another well-known purveyor of entertainment over the internet. In fact, I was so satisfied that I will use Amazon for future movie pu rchases as I have used them for years for my book buys. Believe this: you won't fret over the product you get!"
3,"Good noir flick, lame HD transfer","Being a huge booster of Blu-Ray as the ideal (so far) medium for improving the sight and sound of older movies I was fairly disappointed with this and HD Cinema's concurrent release, ""The Stranger"". While Blu-Ray transfers typically make details sharper, shadows blacker and faces more detailed, these two films' details seem softer and less focused despite the BD transfers.Ironically, this can be proven by watching the short side-by-side comparison each disc offers as an extra feature. The non-Blu-Ray half of the screen looks sharper with more relief. First time I've seen that."
4,kansas city confidental,very good story product arrived as advertised product was in very good shape
5,Nice Soap,"This soap has a nice smell. It's not a very big bar, which is good because it's easy to hold. It seems to last a while too."
5,"great product, great price","product works exactly as described, and the price was reasonable. their support line was also friendly and fast."
4,Why does Amazon lie about retail prices?,The Amazon site states that the retail price for the FoodSaver Vac 300 is $119.99. Where do they get this nonsense? The Tilia site list the retail as $79.99 with a price cut to $59.99. I like Amazon but they do have some sleazy practices.
4,A satisfied customer,The product arrived in a reasonable time and has served us well thus far. Would recommend to others.
5,Food Saver,This was a gift for my mother. She used it while we were visiting and it was awesome! She made a to-go plate for us and sealed it with the food saver. It works just like you see on those commercials.
3,"Starts Great, Falters quickly","I do alot of fishing and felt this would help me save fish easier and longer. It did! Worked great for about a month, then started falling apart, not keeping a seal, etc. So, I bought 1 just for ""non-fish"" thinking that the amount of water/fluid that was being forced into the machine with my fish might have been too much for the product. Same deal. Maybe I'm just too rough, but this particular FoodSaver just didn't last."
1,Worked just one time,"This product is worthless. I used it to seal one test batch of marshmallows, and it failed to seal anything after that. Even with perfect unwrinkled bag position, it sucks and sucks, but never seals. I read the manual, as far as I can tell I'm doing the same thing as with the marshmallows, but it just doesn't work. Plus, you have to lean very hard on the machine to get it to start, so it gets tiring very quickly. Unless you have good upper body strength and a strong masochistic streak, I would avoid this product."
5,waited too long....,The product is everything I wanted. I waited probably too long before making this purchase and I probably have the bottom of the line merchandise but it is so helpful and so easy to use.Being a single person who loves to cook...I buy big sizes and this allows me to portion and freeze for a long time. The additional bags and rolls of plastic are available in my local Fry's....how convenient is that!!!! Happy...Happy...Happy
3,it's alright,Thank goodness I only use it once in a while. The first day I tried using it and it didn't work. I call customer service and they had me remove the rubber seal and make sure there wasn't any dirt and placed it back. It finally did work. The product is simple to use and it seal nicely when it works. The seal doesn't always seal properly. I just have to cross my fingers and hope for the best. I wouldn't purchase another one.
1,jagmag,"It is too bad that they don't have a O star rating. I would use that instead of a one. This is the second Food Saver Vacuum that I have used. The first one, a different model, worked the first time I used it and then died. This one also worked the first time and never worked after that. The first was purchased at BJs and this one from Amazon.com. The vacuum part on both machines failed to work after the first time. I am so frustrated with Food Saver that I will never buy another one of their product. I am now trying to find how to return this for credit toward a different brand."
5,Great documentary about a great radio network,"I have been listening to Air America almost from its inception when I discovered that I could stream it on my computer. This documentary does a great job of showing us how Air America got started and it's great to see the radio personalities learning this new (for some of them) craft. It was Al Franken and his book ""Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right"" that brought me to Air American, but it has been Marc Maron and Sam Sedar who make me stay (and keep me sane!). With this DVD, there is the added plus of listening to the commentary of Randi Rhodes and Marc Maron as well as the filmakers themselves, and they all offer some nice tidbits from behind the scenes. Hopefully Air American will become stronger and the local radio stations (KQKE in my area) can broadcast nothing but progressive/liberal talk radio that will ultimately make our country and the world a better place."
3,They've done better!,"This is the first CD of theirs that didn't hook me with even one song. I found that sometimes they've been hit and miss musically. When I need a Disciple fix I'd reach for (in this order) ""Disciple"" (self-titled, ltd ed. CD/DVD includes ""Things Left Unsaid""), ""This May Sting A Little"", ""Scars Remain"", ""By God"", ""My Daddy Can Whip Your Daddy"", ""What Was I Thinking"" and lastly, ""Back Again""."
1,"Shallow, misses the mark","With all of the material written about this remarkable man, this is the best HBO could come up with? This is the man that put Chamberlain in his place, stood up to Herr Moustache and saved England from the certain defeat of pacifism.And what dialogue do we have from him in this yawn? (spoiler warning)""Please Mrs. Pussycat, come out. Mr. Pug is lonely.""Yikes!"
5,The Right Man in the Right Place at the Right Time.,"Churchill did not create the circumstances that surrounded Europe and Great Britain in the first half of the twentieth century, but he did recognize the dangers that existed and sought to protect the England that he loved from them. In Gathering Storm, Churchill is portayed magnificently by a portly Albert Finney as the egomaniacal, multi-talented genius that he truly was. The movie succeeds in providing telling glimpses into Churchill's private life with his wife Clementine (Vanessa Redgrave), his children, his household staff and friends as well as into his public dealings and persona. I was left wishing for the movie to continue from the point at which it concludes its story.Winston Churchill was not a man of his times, he was a man FOR his times."
4,An outstanding movie,"In the mid 1930's a struggling politician fails to make his voice heard by the English people. He faces a depression, the loss of his family's fortune, and the temporary absence of his wife. Against all odds Winston Churchill attempts to warn his country about the threat of Adolf Hitler. But is anyone willing to listen.This is an excellent movie. It covers the life of Winston Churchill during the years before he became Prime Minister. It is a moving and emotional film. There are many great actors in it as well. it's a very unique and enjoyable watch. If you are a fan of history movies then this is for you."
2,One positve came from this...,I notice most people thought Holly Hunter was great in this film but she just annoyed me! Basically she drove me nuts-It felt like forced acting from her. This movie basically was terrible-the parts that made me laugh were towards the end and should have started the movie and continuted from there! I didn't really care for any of it except one part and that was the cameo by Gavin Rossdale (Bush-lead singer) and that was it. That is the only reason I am keeping this DVD is because Bush was and still one of my favorite bands of all time! Watch if you want but warning it is not the best movie ever made.
5,Its really good,"This is not your classical romantic comedy its different and fun and real. i would suggest this to everyone, the music is really good too."
1,Save your MONEY!,I bought this for $4.00 @ Walmart and guess why it was $4.00. This is one of the worst movies ever and the ending is horrible!!!!!! Save your money and avoid the plague of bad movies!!!! Make hollywood put out good movies for a change!!!!!!Steve
3,people don't know what to make of this movie?,"I looked at the spread of reviewsand it is understandable:reality TV as a chick flick is just hard to deal with.I'm a really Holly Hunter fan andshe is the villain here?But Brittany Murphy is a young sexy Holly Hunter.When faced with her investigation of her boy friend'sold girl friends, she just takes the wrong trackand pays for it?I kind of liked the movie which is entertaining,butthe result is a modern social decay theme?"
2,Waste of Time!,"Brittany Murphy is cute and a decent actress. Unfortunately, this movie stinks! It was marketed as a romantic comedy, and it sure wasn't. If it was anything, it was a drama. Once more, Holly Hunter played her true self -- rude, crude, and cynical. To 'top' it all off, not once did Holly wear a blouse or a tank that didn't bear her belly. Finally, to add insult to injury, the last 10 minutes of the film treats us to a sermon on how life can't be scripted. Anyone over 20 already knows this. Anyone under 20 shouldn't watch this clap-trap."
3,"Four Reasons to Watch this ""Movie""","2004 was a year full of mindless fluff movies that for some reason satisfy the moviegoing public. This slight effort LITTLE BLACK BOOK has only four reasons for viewing it: Holly Hunter, Brittany Murphy, Kathy Bates and Ron Livingston. These are all fine actors and prove that even with a substandard script and heavyhanded direction their talents shine through. The plot, what little there is of it, deals with the consequences of betrayal, all centered on the updated little black palm pilot that unfortunately is a symbol of our preoccupation with technology and how the new knowledge is manipulated for tired old reasons.Watch it for some of the facial language of Murphy and Hunter and for the way all four main characters toss off lines with a bit of tongue in cheek that keeps this flimsy film afloat. Grady Harp"
5,Feel-Good Comedy Thru Mishap,"Actually, as my title suggest, a feel good movie, yet, thru mishaps. Cute personalities, great acting, beautiful women, interesting enough story line, make this movie a hit. Take modern day talk-show TV (Think Jerry Springer); mix it up with young love, stir, bake, and you get the stuff life provides. A bit silly. A bit unrealistic. Still, a satisfying watch. Along life's journey, Brittany's character travels with the perfect plan in mind, hoping to make her life-long dreams come to fruition. Through a tremendous amount of self-made troubles, tears, betrayal, secrets, love and hate, comes panic-stricken ordeals and, still, without giving up hope, her life pans out, and delivers. I found this movie to be effective, and emotional. I loved the ending. Well worth the time to watch. Good date flick."
1,Don't waste your time,"As much as I like Brittany Murphy, I was disappointed & thought this movie would have been better. Brittany got to sing in 2 scenes which is probably a promo for her new album that she will be releasing. Do yourself a favor a skip this one."
2,"A twit, her bo, and lets not forget the dogs past.","In summary I will state that this is a movie about the guy from Office Spaces' PDA. It was mildly entertaining at best.Let's face it; Brittany Murphy is a bad actor. And since we are talking about face, is it just me or does Brittany turn into a monster in the wrong light conditions and facial expressions? It's like she is ugly but cute at the same time.Excuse me while I extract my eyes from their socket with a rusty spoon."
2,Cute at first...downhill after that.,"I was so happy when I was going to see this movie...everyone I heard talk about it just loved it! Why? I have no clue! It was cute when it got started, enjoyable enough, but it was like the same thing over and over again! She thinks her boyfriend is cheating on her so she meets up with all of his ex-girlfriends. The first one was ok, but after all of them I got really tired of it! Some people may enjoy this movie if they don't have any other to watch, but it is not on the top of my list."
3,Ok,"This movie is about a woman who wants to work in broadcast journalism. It starts of simply enough - she is living with her boyfriend. Her boyfriend goes out of town and she looks through his stuff, as well as other things. But I won't go into too much detail, I don't want to ruin the story for you.Basically, if you can not find anything better to rent, I recommend this. It is a very simple, lighthearted movie. It was ok. It deserves 2 stars because of the storyline and acting but I gave it 3 because the movie does have a twist in it."
1,Was Disappointed,This movie was mediocre and not well written. The storyline was very out there and did not make sense. I expected much better.
3,"Very lightweight, but chicks will like this flick","Super duper chick flick supreme. So why did I watch it? I don't know. I can't explain. Much of the acting is a bit lame, especially the female lead who is the worst of the bunch. The others are okay. The script is incredible, and by that I mean not credible. This sends up daytime TV confessional shows in a decent way."
3,Different,"In this movie we are introduced to a young woman named Stacy and her boyfriend Derek. Stacy secures a job on a daytime talkshow, hosted by Kathy Bates. She is befriended by a co-worker named Barb, who plants seeds against Stacy's relationship with Derek. Stacy begans to spy on him, using his Palm Pilot, and finds out he has many secrets. However, Barb turns out to be anything but a friend and Stacy is betrayed, turning her entire world and those of others unside down.The story takes many twists and turns and I suppose if one were to get anything out of it, it would be just to be honest with whoever you are in a relationship with, especially if you are planning a future with that person. Nothing remains a secret forever."
4,It wasn't that horrible,"A lot of you that wrote reviews thought that it was a bad movie. I personally think that Murphy did a great job as an actress and really showed herself in character. With the huge twist in the ending, the movie seemed different than most. This movie also showed that someone who can have such a huge setback can also recover and follow your dreams. Murphey prooved that you should never quit. I, along with some friends, really enjoyed this movie. It taught us something about ourselves, that we can accomplish ANYTHING, if we just believe."
3,Crack open this 'little black book' once.,"I rented this last night. I thought this would be better than it ended up being. I like Brittany Murphy, but this movie isn't her best performance (I think Uptown Girls would be closer to that) I actually fell asleep during one point in this movie. The best part is the end, everything leading up to it is so-so, I was even bored at one point. Overall, I would say rent and watch once, it's average."
1,Something stinks oh this movie,There were a few funny parts..but I didnt like this movie at all. There was nothing there to keep you captivated enough.I was so bored. Had I not been waiting on my husband in another theater I would have left
1,Real fun - if you're a masochist,I can honestly think of hundreds(if not thousands) of better ways to spend my time than watch this drivel. I fell asleep watching it and did not regret it in the least(falling asleep that is). The whole Carly Simon thing is overblown and not in the least bit funny or endearing. Didn't laugh once. Pure torture.
5,A haunting splendid album...,I bought this album used and I wasn't sure what it was exactly but I was able to preview it before I purchased it. Very beautiful and interesting spoken word with interesting ambient/instrumental music accompanying it. I'd recommend this if you like interesting narrative albums with strange sounds. The themes of the album are about AIDS and decease. Very Good Recording!
1,toe ring,Would not buy another one! This ring didn't even look like real silver and once cleaned it looked worse. Very disappointed.
5,Just the right toe ring for me,I love my toe rings. I wear them year round and this one is perfect for that. It is comfortable and is plenty large enough for me. I wear a size 7 shoe and have a medium sized toe and the ring is plenty big for me. I noticed another reviewer thought it was small. Not so for me. It is great. It looks good and I will really enjoy having it on my vacation down south this winter.
5,Death in Gaza,"This documentary is both extremely sad and extremely powerful. I first saw Death in Gaza when it originally aired on HBO a couple years ago. Since then, I've periodically searched for it to no avail. When I found out Amazon.com would be carrying it, I immediately purchased it. This is a must-see for anyone interested in Middle East politics or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is both heart-breaking and disturbing to see what reality is for so many. One of the most moving scenes for me is the funerals for the martyrs. Some are crying, some are chanting militant anthems, and a man on a megaphone incites the people to Jihad. ""We must continue the struggle until victory or martyrdom"" he urges, his voice reverberating while an eerie soundtrack plays in the background. Seeing the impact on the children is also difficult to watch. This is a reality that should be seen by all."
2,"[Two-and-a-half stars out of four] Should be better, but undone...","by Zionist Propaganda...What did we expect fromJames Miller. All arabs are terrorists and allIsraelis are angels is pretty much what is exem-plified here! Yes, the gazans who strp bobms tothemselves don't make it easy for the rest of thenon-israelis trying to get to the peace table.But how about the ending, where Miller IS SHOTDEAD BY AN ISRAELI SOLDIER IN THE GAZA STRIP!It turns out to be the saving grave from justanother film bashing arabs and siding w/ theisraeli arressors. A good enogh effort but stillnot as good as Jay Pilger, the Australians film,shown several times on world link t.v., ""PalestineIs Still The issue."""
5,Gaza review,"Death in Gaza was an extraordinary documentary on the war and violence along the Gaza strip. As a consumer, it was shipped to me in a timely manner took only 4 days, and I was pleased with the packaging as well.Two thumbs up for this company if i ever make a purchase again online i hope its with these people!"
5,Awesome and Informative,"This DVD is packed with interviews from Palestinians in Israel - from mothers who lost children in gun fire, to children studying at school, to militant leaders of fanatical Islamic suicide groups allowing very small children hold rocket launchers while telling them to ""be a man"".Unfortunately, the journalist who films the majority of this documentary was shot in the neck and died before he was able to interview Jewish children. This film documents the tragic problems that the children must endure and the hate that keeps any peace from occuring.If you want to know what's going on in Israel... look no further than the mouths of babes. Absolutely amazing! Why isn't this on the news? Everyone should watch this video. You'll understand the terrorist's point of view."
4,fair,"There were some scenes in here I was glad I saw. Nothing was quite so powerful was watching boys throwing stones at tanks and seeing tanks fire back. Stones versus tanks. To those that say the movie is biased because it doesn't cover the Israeli point of view, I will reiterate what has been said over and over--he was killed before he got a chance. The crew seemed rightly appalled at the way Palestinian miltants used children--this is no blind propaganda for the Palestinian cause. But you know, if ever anyone had a good reason to be biased, it would certainly be one who was killed by the mighty while weilding only a white flag"
5,Wonderful to Read Aloud,"I read this book to my 7 year old twin girls, and the three of us loved it. The vocabulary, the humor, the characters were all wonderful. I have high hopes that the author will continue to write children's books."
2,I had major downloading problems with this one,"This flash memory card offered good storage capacity per dollar (about $1 per Meg) and works fine in my camera (a Kodak 4800 that I had used with Kodak 16 Meg and Viking 32 Meg cards), but when I tried to download the pictures to my iMac, all hell broke loose. I get error messages saying that there is not enough memory to download the thumbnnails, but no amount of memory reallocation seems to work, and the problems I have been getting are nonreproducible. The person at the Kodak help line was sympathetic but said he could not solve the problem with a non-Kodak product. They offered to transfer my 250 pictures from the Sandisk onto a CD-rom for free once, but I can't do this every time I use the darned card.SanDisk offers no troubleshooting help line.I wish I'd bought a Kodak or Viking card now. Sandisk is also chintzy not providing a plastic protective disc container, as others do."
5,Gorecki and the Kronos Quartet at their most profound,"Though obviously not ideal, some quartet music can be played in the background where it will stay. Other compositions demand to be heard, and so we have Gorecki's first and second string quartets. I hear them as profound explorations of the human interior and of external forces that consistently oppose it. This is particularly true in String Quartet 2, which begins with a pensive largo, passes through an ominous - if not terrifying - march and ends with ecstatic perseverance.The Kronos Quartet plays beautifully here, and with assurance, conviction and understanding.This is one of the most important end-of-the-century quartet recordings that I know of. One afternoon I listened to both quartets after Beethoven's String Quartet No. 13 and Bartok's String Quartet No. 3. It was a moving experience, and I can't help but think that I emerged from it a slightly better man."
5,Just what I wanted,"I got this chime to ring to catch audience's (mostly children) attention before making announcements. Works great. Sound carries nicely.The only issue I have is that the stick to ring the chime isn't very sturdy. It's fine for me to use, but I'd be wary of letting a child play with the stick portion."
2,Don't Bother,"I've seen worse. I never cared for any of the characters (though Corey was mildly sympathetic), so why should I care what happens to them? Occasionally interesting, usually boring, and not worth even a rental. Cool music video, though (""Beautiful"" by Joydrop)."
1,I May Have Seen Worse Movies...,"but thankfully I don't remember any of them. This is another turkey destined to hopefully fade into the oblivion of time. It amazes me that with all the equipment and actors available that they would turn this junk out. There was no credible and cohesive plot-just a hodgepodge of scenes thrown together.The slipbox at the rental store made it look so good but it bombed from the first five minutes on. Do yourself a favor and rent something, ANYthing else! This is a total waste of time."
2,Not the ultimate guide,I enjoyed watching this DVD but for being a student and beginner this DVD was not for beginners but more to enhance already learned skills. No doubt this DVD will come in handy but beware if you are new to hairdressing.
1,didnt fit!,I have an ipod classic 7th generation and the circle opening for the click wheel doesn't line up! Also it doesn't have credit card slots as mentioned in the description.Crap.
3,Did not fit my 5th gen Ipod video 30GB,"I bought this case for my Ipod video 30GB. The leather quality is pretty good. The case looks attractive, but the bad news is that it doesn't fit (too small) for my Ipod. I tried very hard to slide it inside, which I regret now as I can't take my Ipod out because it's too tight inside. However the customer service is good. After all I decided to keep the case as I won't be able to take my Ipod out without damaging either the case or the Ipod. Anyone planning to buy this case for you Ipod 30GB beware!"
1,Do the Math Before You Buy,"You have only enough disposable income to buy one Bo Diddley album. You want the original Chess recordings, so it needs to be something on MCA (which purchased the Chess catalog years ago). Here are your choices:1) 20 Century Masters (2000) - 12 songs of classic Bo Diddley: ""Bo Diddley,"" ""I'm a Man, ""Who Do You Love,"" ""Road Runner"" and others.2) Chess 50th Anniversary Collection (1997) - 20 songs of classic Bo Diddley. Ten of the 12 songs on the 20th Century Masters disc, plus another 10 songs, including ""Pretty Thing,"" ""Before You Accuse Me"" and ""The Story of Bo Diddley."" [And this album is still in print!]It's examples like this where MCA has two competing anthologies by the same artist in its catalog that it becomes obvious their biggest concern is getting your money instead of meeting your music needs."
5,Excellent read!,"This was a bizarre freaky ready! Truly nothing else like this one out there. Like an LSD trip from beginning to end, as Farmer uses many images and scenes that were frightening and almost psychotic at times. Make sure you read this one if you are a Farmer fan!"
3,Where the hell is the sequel?,"One of the best, most interesting sci-fi books I've ever read, EXCEPT that the ending is clearly setting us up for a sequel. What the hell kind of book leaves us hanging in the middle of a plot? Another reviewer said, ""Oh, I get it."" But there's nothing to get. Farmer simply quit in the middle of this because he's arrogant and got busy with something else."
5,Ryan's Room Firefighters,"My two year old son loves these ""guys"" and keeps track of them as he takes them everywhere on adventures with us (with and without the fire truck and fire station in tow...). They work well with the fire set and are easy for him to manipulate.Highly recommend this product."
4,good but confusing,"i love this book it shows all the things that starfleet officers need to think about when contacting new races (something that you never see in the television series!). it does however get confusing with regards to the morals of the sivoans (cat people) another disappointing factor was the portrayl of Mr Spock, i much prefer Diane Duane's portrayl of this significant chracter. however i have to say that Dr McCoy character was written to perfection. all in all a good book if confusing at times"
2,"""Mary Sue"" hits space...","The most egregious ""Mary Sue"" Trek book on record, ""Uhura's Song"" presages some of the more extravagant fan-fiction missives by putting the author, the late Janet Kagan, into the narrative as the puckish Dr. Evan Wilson. Wilson dominates the story, solving every crisis, somehow knowing the solution to every dilemma, and generally leading the entire Trek crew around by the nose. Uhura's character, ostensibly the book's subject, is reduced even further to a bit player in the drama.The plot is basically straight out of the mind of a shut-in cat person - a race of noble, intelligent felines attempt to overcome an AIDS-type epidemic by connecting to their long-lost cousins, a primitive yet honorable society of talking meowers.Kagan wasn't devoid of writing skill - her Hugo Award wins certainly indicate otherwise - but this novel definitely does not represent her as anything other than a glorified Star Trek fan-fiction author. Disappointing..."
2,Mary Sue syndrome,"This could have been a very good Star Trek novel. The plot is engaging and the alien culture-building is excellent. Unfortunately its one flaw is a fatal one. The very annoying Dr Wilson ruins every scene she's in, and in the fashion of a Mary Sue she's in almost every scene. Cut out the author's pet character and give her part of the story to the others--especially Uhura, who is reduced to a supporting cast role in what is supposedly her story--and this would have been one of the best of the TOS novels, but as it is it is nigh unreadable."
2,Agonizingly Slow,"Very, very slow plot. Pages and pages of mindless interaction with talking cats. And this is a old Trek novel, so the print is 2/3's the size of the modern print...making it even longer.After suffering through the entire book, the ending is, well, eh.Pick up 'Doctors Orders' for a more interesting 'native population interaction' novel. This one isn't even worth a penny."
3,Still the same vinyl source used for mastering!,"This so called remaster is taken from the same vinyl source as all the previous CD releases (you can easily hear the vinyl noises in the paus between track 3 and 4 if you turn up the volume). This CD is just a bit EQ-ed and has extra reverb added. If you have one of the earlier CDs (or even better the original vinyl) you don't need to get this one.The music itself is great beeing one of the heaviest productions Vangelis was ever involved in, but there are also some spacey moments very typical for V's 70s style. I guess this is how Aphrodite's Child could have sounded if they had continued during the 70s. VANGELIS ROCKS!!"
1,Stupid and Annoying,"I made it through 32 minutes of this tripe. The narrator/main character speaks in overly simplistic terms in an annoying, whining voice throughout. The plot is interrupted far too frequently with clips from news reels and old movies. I wasted $9.99. Save your money."
2,Vaughan Williams The Royal Philharmonic The Wasps (excerpts),"The sound is fine for the first three, but then goes quiet, louder, very very quiet... can't hear the music, louder. It is irritating. Anyone else have this problem?"
4,cheap but works good,"for the price it does everything it should, everyone needs one close by because we have forgotten to add thanks to these things."
4,OK for the purpose of SAT and ACT exams,I purchased these for students in foster care homes who need calculators for the ACT exams. Seems that our child protective services do not extend to actually assisting children to exit the system.
3,What I expected,"The calculator arrived on time as it was scheduled to, and it was what I expected it to be. Simple calculator for basic math."
5,simple calculator,"I just needed a cheap, simple calculator and this is it.It is a bit light and small, but this was the cheap."
5,"Good, simple calculator",This is a great calculator for basic functions. I like having a battery power calculator that still works in low light. My wife has the same model and has been using it for years on the same battery. The display is easy to read and the buttons are easy to push.
5,An excellent HD transfer,"Have been waiting for a long time for this film to come in HD format. Bought it today and the image is excellent, sharp, 3D with warm and saturated, rich colour. Have to admit that having watched it several times, feel the pace is a little bit slow, nevertheless it blends wonderfully with the music."
5,Beautiful and Profoundly Sad,"There's more here than can be appreciated in a single viewing. I just finished my third pass and the film just blows me away.If you think it's too slow you're just skimming the surface of what's there.And if the final scene doesn't make your heart ache, you're not the kind of person I want to know!"
4,another great move,"This movie is one of my favorites, the look, the music the wardrobe,the love story, great all round and i'm sure you will agree"
2,MOODY ADULTEROUS MELODRAMA,"Wong Kar-Wai's dramatic romance ""IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE"" set in 1960's Hong Kong stars Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung as married friends who discover their respective spouses are having an affair. This beautifully filmed, sophisticated love story has won a trunk load of awards. The profusive two disc set is up to Criterion's high standards and includes hours of extras and wonderful documentary on the making of the film. For an alternative tale that sets up simlar circumstances but goes in a deliciously dangerous direction, see Chabrol's ""CRY OF THE OWL."""
2,yawn!,"I can't understand all the hype. This movie was quite booring. As I left the theater another man and I looked at each other and said ""what was that?"" I'll give it 5 stars for beautiful shots, but the unrequited love thing didn't appeal to me and it went nowhere. Don't bother unless you can see it for free. And then maybe do it on an empty stomach so you will fall asleep."
1,Most boring movie i've seen in years,"I'm generally a fan of art-house films... But honestly, this movie was just really boring. Many of the scenes are like 10 minutes long where the camera just pans back and forth with little dialogue."
4,A huge upgrade from dvd version,I have watched the dvd version several times. The bluray version is far better in VQ & AQ .HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
4,Unsure,My product arrived on time and was in excellent condition. I really apperciate the booklet. It was presented as advertise. This should be require by all sellers to give as much information as possible about their product. This cost me more than I usually spend on dvds but was well worth it.
4,More than one viewing required,"Ok guys..I'll have to admit there are flaws but like jazz improvisation there are miracles too. Wong Kar Wai is a love/hate director at times. Had he not had Tony & Maggie's charismatic talent..it might have failed in many ways. But he knows his stars and how to push them. The last scene w/ the ruins,the monk observing Tony whispering the secret, is still worth repeated viewings! Can't wait for 2046 (his next film) which by the way was the room # in IMFL's deleted love scene. See..he wants you to watch these over and over. Gotta love the guy."
2,"Started to like it, then...","I immediately fell in love with this film. It was beautifully acted, and photographed. But that later changed. I loved the story of the 2 main characters and wanted to see their relationship develop (by either moving forward or even backward). Instead (about half way through the film), it was as if the director had run out of ideas. The plot/film just ran out of steam. The music cues (once beautiful) now became unintentioinally funny. The slow pacing became more exposed and obvious (since the story simply stopped) and the film dragged on to it's obvious conclusion. Overly self conscious. A shame really, as it started so promisingly."
3,For fans of Wong Kar Wai only,"Tony Leung (as Mr. Chow) has never brooded better, Maggie Cheung (as Mrs. Chan) never more the solitary and quirky female we are so fond of seeing in a Wong Kar Wai film... unfortunately, it's all let down by a plot that's wafer-thin! Amazon.com's in-house reviewer (Jeff Shannon) has basically spelt out the entire story in two sentences. Yes, the cinematography is immaculate but so mannered with its scenes of curling smoke, rain falling on pavement, of significant glances exchanged that it also leaves the central characters sadly unengaging. MOOD and POSE alone does not a great film make. For a truly great film by this director, get ""Happy Together""."
3,lacking something,"Nice music,nice performing, nice -yeah, beautiful actors- and a feature lacks of something anyway as ""Additional scenes"" in DVD Extras testify to.Up till date,Happy Togetheris the best work of Kar Wai-Wong, believe it or not to!"
5,"in love with the idea of ""in the mood for love""","The film was absolutely mesmerizing. The music, re-creation of 1960's HK, Ms. Cheung's costumes to that incredible closing scene with Mr. Leung's character in Angkor Wat left me breathless.It's a very well-crafted film. But almost too composed.There is no sense of spontaneity as with Wong Kar Wai's earlier films, Chungking Express, Fallen Angels and Happy Together most notably. Perhaps it speaks of more restrictive times.It felt like we were watching Wong Kar Wai's childhood memories through rose-colored filters.This film is very richly textured and tighter compositionally than his earlier works. The pace is slow and I kept waiting for something to ""happen"". As with all his works it left me yearning for more. This film deserves more than one viewing."
4,a smooth one,"really exciting love story. But not what you expect, if you hear the name Wong Kar-Wai: no gangstar flick here. The famous Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung playing neighbors, betrayed by their husband eg. wife. Coming up with a touching loveaffair between these two, Wong Kar-Wai shows another time his genius narrative skills. This text refers to the german DVD with mandarin language and german subtitles. Also available subs: English, Spanish, French, Italian..."
3,One note song,"I was more engrossed in this film than I should have been. It has a very simple plot. No twists and turns. Just the one question: ""Will they or won't they?""Basically, it's the prolonged musings of a man and woman thrown together because their spouses are having an affair. They, however, seem too principled to give into their own obvious chemistry.Like the other Wong Kar Wai films I have seen, this is beautifully directed and photographed. It is set in Hong Kong of the 1960s, therefore, vaguely familiar to us Westerners who remember the 1960s.To be honest, if I watch it again, it will be to revel in Maggie Cheung in the form-fitting cheongsom dresses popular in Hong Kong the 60s. (She's also very pretty in the special features contained on the DVD.)"
5,My first chemistry book.,I enjoyed reading it when I was 12. I am surprised so many copies are available.
3,Cable security for laptop,"easy to use . long flexible cable, 4 digit code lock. The down side is it adds more weight to your gear and the small numbers are getting harder to see each year. Most hotels do not have what I'd consider a good place to secure the cable. a wood desk leg, 3 good kicks and it's gone, OTOH kinda obvious when hanging off your laptop. My lever seems to hangup somethings (poor alignment) on pushing it to align for insertion or removal, but for the cost of the cable I guess I can't expect a machined frame. Bottom line, it will deter the lightweight thieves from physical removal. Now is your data secured on it?"
3,Not for finicky felines,"I purchased this product for my cat because she has a shedding problem that I had hoped would be easily remedied by adding this to her wet food. Not so! Not only would she not eat ANY of the wet food after this product was added, but she wouldn't even go near the bowl. She'd take one snife from a distance and walk away. Admittedly, my finicky feline does not care for seafood entrees, and I had no idea that this product would smell so strongly of fish. So, I can't say whether it would have worked or not, thus the 3 stars."
4,Miserere,"Although the CD tends toward the somber, there is a majestic quality to Gorecki's music. The harmonies in Broad Waters are especially stunning."
1,It Doesn't Get Any Worse,"Imagine the worst porn movie you've ever seen - the acting and plot in this film is ten times worse. And like a bad porn movie, you'll be embarrassed if you watch this film with anyone but yourself.Not even a fifth of good whiskey will make this film entertaining - you'll just sit there with the dry heaves, praying you can throw up, go to bed, and forget about it. Unfortunately, this movie is like the stomach flu - it'll stay with you for days.I know, with a review like this, you just have to see it. Trust me, you're wrong. Don't go to the ""White Light."""
3,What were you looking for?,"I've read some of the reviews of this film (good and bad) and I cannot believe the people who wrote the bad reviews actually thought it was supposed to be real. Did you really think the Blair Witch Project was real as well? These are MOVIES!If you accept BLAIR WITCH and ST. FRANCISVILLE for what their producers intended; Cheaply made, scripted movies pretending to be documentaries, then you'll begin to see the fun in them.And St. Francisville was a fun film. There were actually some very good (and frightful) moments. The chair flying across the room, for one. The people who are upset that B.W. and ST. Francisville are ""obvious fakes"" are probably confused as to why The Beatles allowed Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band to perform on one of their albums."
5,A Spook-tacular Time!,"This is one one the Cheesiest, Silly, Predictable, Cliched,Shock-O-Rama movies to come out in 30 years that actually works. I'm sorry, this movie is tons of fun and contains some real scares that will raise the hairs on your neck. Is it a rip-off of ""Blair Witch Project""? Yes! But you know what? It works. It has great scares and would be perfect for a little girls sleepover at Halloween Time. I am a sucker for this type of flick! Boo!"
1,Here's the bottom line ...,"Based on an intriguing premise, the filmmakers hired four bad actors to spend the night in a haunted house, which in actuality is a very nice home somebody obviously left for the weekend so the film could be fabricated. A legitimate ghost hunter was brought in to make things even more authentic.But, alas, nothing does happen in the house, so a bunch of dumb, cheap and non-scary sight gags (no pun intended) had to be created to fill in the gaps. The result is a cross between ""The Real World"" (with participants only half as intelligent -- now that's saying something) and a day in the worst amusement park haunted house ever."
5,"To: viewer from nevada january 9, 2001",you are a major d-u-m-b-a-s-s. you wouldn`t know a good movie if you were in it. and its not a comedy.
1,I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM,"... so my review is a wee bit more objective than some of the phony ""4-star"" ratings you'll see here.If you have relatives or friends under the age of 14, give them a video camera and turn them loose in a dark house after instructing them to ""make a scary movie."" I guarantee you, they will make a more frightening film than this 77-minute wad of bad-intentions-gone-worse piece of drek. It's hard to determine what's worse in this movie-- the acting or the production values.No one enjoys a good horror film more than I, and no one enjoys a BAD horror film more than I, but the ""St. Francisville Experiment"" is neither. It's a shameless, moronic ""Blair Witch"" ripoff that will make you wonder just how embarrassed you can be simply by watching TV."
1,Blech,"This movie is so pointless. They say it is real, but the only thing real about this crapfest is the fact that it is an idiotic Blair-Witch rip-off that couldn't generate any chills evan if it had the chance to. I saw this movie 2 days ago, and I'm still washing the taste out of my mouth. AVOID."
1,Stupid piece of trash,This is a stupid movie. The things they said the woman did to her slaves creeped me out. Other than that it isn't scary. Don't bother renting it or buying it. It's just not worth watching.
3,Descent,"The movie started out pretty slow. The interviews weren't anywhere close to being interesting, I almost fast-forwarded it. Luckily I had my girlfriend over and she was doing the whole scared girl thing, just because I told her it was going to be a horror movie. The roach on the sandwich was a very obvious touch to the already predictable movie. Like some of the others I thought the ending saved the whole movie. The actors were crap and untalented. Just a bunch college brats who thought it'd be ""cool"" to be in a haunted house. So i'd rent it or buy it anyway, just for the hell of it."
3,Er.... I guess it was ok,"I just finished watching this movie and before I began to watch it, I thought it was ""real"" as it was hyped in the trailer and website. The legend = true, the movie = fake. It was obvious that it was fake withing the first 20 minutes of the film where it was obvious that some of the events were staged, not to mention the horrible and fake reactions of the actors. This movie would've worked so well if the staged events weren't so obvious nor off the wall. It could have even been plausible, with the proper ating that is. Over all, it was entertaining and it was funny so I won't go so far as to call it a horrible film. I guess I was just a little disappointed that it wasn't real : ( But it's ok in my book and I would definately buy the DVD because despite it being fake, the movie does provide some scares... I said some : )"
3,Review from a local...,"I was born and raised in the small town of St. Francisville, LA, so it definitely caught my eye when I spotted this film on the shelf at the video store. Being a local, I've heard all the ghost stories associated with the local plantations... particularly the ones known for being haunted. ""The St. Francisville Experiment"" obviously used a group of unknown actors...probably unknown because of their acting abilities. However, the story behind the film is accurate...the stories behind some of the local plantations have been scaring the bejeebers out of me for years. It would have been nice, though, if a little bit more money had been put into the film to help the events seem a little more realistic. I do recommend this film, but warn you not to have high expectations. It gets off to a slow start, but things pick up a little as the story unfolds."
2,"ANOTHER SORRY ""COULD'VE BEEN""","This movie was an obvious attempt to ride the coat-tails of ""The Blair Witch Project"" as far as ""reality-based"" supernatural thriller films go. Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Blair Witch."" However, both movies are perfect examples of what could have been perfect executions of an ingenius idea.""St. Francisville"" had all the potential of being the scariest movie ever. However, much of that potential was lost due largely to its female lead. It must be a rule that every recent horror movie has to have that annoying young psychic know-it-all egg to spoil near the beginning of the film and then stink up the rest of the picture.The movie was genuinely terrifying for a total of 40 seconds out of 76 minutes. Worth seeing once for the ""mirror"" scene (thus the two out of five rating).I hope someone gets this idea right someday. It's a crying shame..."
4,not bad at all,"Hey, we've all seen the Blair Witch by now, and some of us liked it. Well, this movie shows you everything. Even though it's obviously fake, this movie is still way freaky. The ending was so amazingly over the top, and it satisfied oh so much. I had all the lights off, and the SurroundSound WAY up on this one. so, real, fake.... what does it matter? give it a shot, i don't think you'll be upset that you did."
3,i wanna be the blair witch,"just like the blair witch, this movie is scary but only if you are alone with no lights on in a big house. The best part of the movie is the last 20minutes. The rest of the movie is kind of stupid. I think that they need to remake the movie just about the end. Then that might really get the attention that it deserves."
3,"Better then the pitiful remake of ""The Haunting""","This movie starts slowly and is pretty dull for the first half hour or so. The middle of the movie is okay and the end is actually pretty good. The ""Psychic"" is the most unlikeable of the four main characters-the kind of person who won't leave the house unless her horoscope says it's okay. Not believable in many aspects--but as believable as ""Blair Witch"" if you're the sort of person PT Barnum used to allude to. Worth watching, probably a little better if you watch it alone in the middle of the night like I did."
1,File this movie under comedy!,"Are you kidding me? ""Everything you've heard is true""?!?!?! What a farce. Somebody please explain to me why the subject of this film never made the headlines, the news, or even one of those paranormal shows on TV. Further, if it is real, why did it go straight to the shelves of Blockbuster rather than to the big screen? And hmmmm...coincidence that it was made right after the Blair Witch buzz?It is so obvious from the start that this so-called documentary is really just a ....film laced with horrible acting and directing. I love how those cameras the actors are carrying always seem to fall in the perfect position when they are dropped - filming that bug in ths sandwhich, filming that kid getting dragged away, filming their own faces perfectly in the center of the screen.This is a horrible movie. I'd rather wash my car then rent it again."
2,"Good Concept and Back Story, Bad writing and Execution","This movie took a real screwed up story and had a decent concept for it, but they butchered it by not providing a good outlet for it. For example, they took a real true story about a woman who tortured her slaves and attempted to make a documentary/ghost story out of it, but they failed because they had it take place in a house where she ""may"" have hid for awhile. They should have had this take place in her actual house (or a house that was supposed to be it) and scared the crap out of the kids and viewers, there were tons of ghostly things that could have happened to them with the idea of Madame's slaves in mind.The characters were all likable other then the Psychic who just annoyed the crap out of me and made me want to shut it off.For a much more in depth review for this stinky movie, please check out my horror movie/book review blog Shivers of Horror. Link in profile."
3,"Good, but not THAT good!","I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""St. Francisville Experiment"" at the same time. The hype over this one is way, WAY over the top, but I was interested in seeing how these films handled their offbeat ""documentary"" approach, and I was satisifed. It takes an awful lot of talent to make even a BAD movie, so I have to give these filmmakers their due -- but not one iota more than they deserve. And to paraphrase Lewis Black: If you saw either one of these movies and, for even one moment, thought that they were ""based on a true story,"" etc. then I want you to wear tinfoil on your head so the rest of us know who you are...."
1,77 minutes I'll never get back,"To call this one of the worst movies I've ever seen is an insult to the worst movies I've ever seen. With a ""plot"" obviously lifted from a certain witch project you'd think at least you'd be mildly scared. WRONG. Not only does this ""real"" documentary contain every horror house cliche known to man it presents them without one bit of style or suspense. Bad acting, obviously scripted and contrived situations, plot inconsitencies large enough to drive 1,000 trucks through and the cleanest abandoned haunted house you or I will ever come across do not make for a good movie. I'll play by the rules and not give any spoilers-but any child can see that props were obvious plants. Even if you hated ""Blair Witch"" seeing it again is better than seeing this once. Not scary. Not funny. Not worth a look. Oh, BTW, I believe in ghosts and haunted houses-only not ineptly portrayed shams."
3,I gave this 3 stars because it is a special film...,I gave this movie 3 stars. This all depends on what you are looking for in a movie. This movie is embarassingly horrible... it is a great laugh... it is a travesty caught on tape. But if you are in the video store looking for the worst movie ever made... THIS IS IT. The St. F Experiment is the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! So rent it while expectations are at an all time low and have some fun. Trash does not always need to be taken out...James
4,"BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IT'S WHAT YOU DON'T SEE!!!","this movie is one of my favorites. it'll spook the crap out of you. believe me you'll be watching your back, and think twice whenever the hair on your neck stands on end. true or not there are such things out there, and you don't have to see them to believe. i recommend this it is a good film, and you will enjoy it. it has enough scares to make you look around and be afraid even if it's for just a short while."
3,"Obviously just a movie, but still pretty creepy","I didn't expect much from this movie since it was straight-to-video..., but it did have its moments. While it stated in the beginning that it is all real, there were moments when I believed it, and many moments when I didn't. For instance, Madison, the so-called psychic was so overdramatic and seemed like she was reading lines off a cue card. Certain camera angles (the bug-in-the-sandwich shot), and the somewhat over-the-top ending made me question the reality of it all. Also, they had a seance with a Ouija board! You can buy those things at K-Mart, so that was a give away that it was all staged. However, the reactions the actors had when something scary happened was believable and I can honestly say I could feel myself tense up with fear and suspense when someone would enter a dark room or passageway. My advice: rent it for a few good scares, but don't buy into the whole ""this is real"" nonsense."
2,Not convincing or even interesting,"Unlike The Blair Witch Project, where I debated for several days whether or not it was real, this movie left me zero doubt that it was fake. Very early in the show, a chandelier falls to the ground after some hapless thrill seeker dares to flip its light switch to the ON position. Gimme a break. The rest of the film was just more cheap scare tactics and unbelievable stuff that left no doubt that this movie was just that - a movie. And not a very good one at that. The Blair Witch Project was plausible, which is what made it so scary. This movie is just dumb. I gave it two stars for the scary effects. That's about all it had going for it."
2,Sometimes Low-Budget Cheese isn't so bad,"For such a low-budget, cheesey movie, St. Francisville Experiment actually packs a few thrills. It's slow going at the beginning, and it's a real toss-up as to who is the most annoying character (although Madison really tries hard to earn that title). But if you can sit through it without falling asleep, you will be rewarded with a few honst to goodness scares."
3,A good example of Upshaw's adventurous programming,"Early on Dawn Upshaw carveda niche for herself on the New York music scene with daring song recitlas, often at the 92nd St. Y, that critics adored. This CD gives us a perfect example, ranging form Dowland and Monteverdi to Crumb and Schwantner. Except for the Villa-Lobos, most of the selections will be obscure for the average listener. I wish I could say the results totally delighted me. But Upshaw seems a little uninvolved here, and the theme of Morpheus, god of sleep, suggests that the tone is too consistently nocturnal. There's no denying her artistry, but this is one Upshaw recital I rarely pull out of a listen all the way through."
2,Crashlanding.,"Unfortunately not their best album but it still has some merit, it has a very strong English flavour to it probably has something to do with the fact that they are all born there.The style is for want of a better description alternate pop."
5,Great addition to the family hauler,"Before installing these Monroe Air Shocks whenever I loaded the van for a family trip (4 children, 2 adults, roof rack box full of gear, etc.) and filled up the gas tank to hit the road the back of the van would be nearly scraping the concrete. After installing these shocks I can load up the van and then pressurize the shocks leveling the van perfectly! Fabulous! Keeps my headlights shining down the road where they belong and helps keep things on an even keel. Installation was very simple, the kit includes air-line routing hardware and instructions. Several thousand miles since installation and all is on the level."
3,It's okay,"I thought about 3 of the songs were good. #2 is my favorite and that is why I bought the CD, Hippychick is a song I haven't heard since I was 10 yrs old. It's been great to hear it again after 13 years of not hearing it. That guitar begining was something I was never able to get out of my head. Overall, the CD is okay, not great, but I still like track #2!"
4,Hird Moving On,"This CD took me by surprise. Nice blend of jazz, downtempo and housey tracks. Yukimi Nagano Is on a few tracks. Her voice is silky smooth and perfect for Hird's production. The first 3 tracks will get you. The truly stand out tracks are:Fading BluesMoving OnKeep you KimiI love you myGetting closerTHe only reason that the cd does not get 5 stars is that there are a couple of tracks that don't flow with the mood the CD sets. Other than that it is well worth the purchase."
4,Good for tired muscles?,"I bought an aromatherapy gift set a year ago, and this is one of the oils that was inside. I thought nothing of it until my sister wanted it. she said she heard that geranium oil was good on tired sore muscles. Since she teaches karate i thought i would let her try it. she told me that it did work great, and the smell wasn't too bad at all. I ordered her some more, but have not yet tried it myself. Haven't been sore enough to use it."
4,Worthwhile read,"This is a classic of the genre.As a recreational read, it's prose is ponderous. There are whole paragraphs which are virtually incomprehensible unless one is willing spend twenty minutes with a dictionary reading and re-reading.But, I have been interested in the ability of ""Hollow Earth Theory"" (The theories of John Symmes and the subsequent books by Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Jules Verne) to capture the popular nineteenth century imagination and its influence into the twentieth century. This text influenced some of the concepts in Theosophy and Ariosophy. It's a book with interesting historical connections."
5,2 live crew rock's,"hi i'm a white boy from australia ,I think this album is the bomb ! luke and the 2 live are at there best in this album i think although I have only the pleasure to listen to 3 albums in total .. they are the best and set the grounds for rap/hiphop for the future ...."
3,Works but so would the piece you could get at Home depot,This is obivoiusly a connection for air lines. I'm using mine as a reducer on a hose real. That said it's overpriced here. Home Depot or Lowes should have something very similar in their plumbing isles. Anything that is marked with NPT (North American Pipe Thread) will work. Save yourself a few bucks and do that instead. The only exception I can recommend is if your situation is the same as mine in that you have very limited space to work in.
5,10 out of 5,"Simply superb. All tracks are beautifully orchestrated with lush tones and harmonics. Deep meaningful lyrics underpin exquisite musical virtuosity. Innocence was and still are ahead of their time. Innocence exudes similar spiritual overtones to early Santana classics such as Welcome, Borboletta and Caravanserai.Their musical greatness is probably magnified by their absence. If only they would return with more."
5,From Age to Age,"This is a beautiful and interesting book, ideal for people wanting a good history of the Church."
1,BUGS!!!,Bought this product from our local Publix where it's often buy 1 get 1 free.We ate it a couple of times and I must saw we did like the taste.One day I tore open the packaging when my son started crying. I went to him and left the packaging on the counter. I came back a minute later and my countertop was crawling with tiny little bugs that could have been mistaken for spices if they weren't moving! I emptied the back in a zip-loc and it was full of these little bugs crawling around. If I would of put the packaging directly in the water i'm sure the bugs would have died instantly in the water.I was completely disgusted and called the company. The woman on the line was completely unfazed saying it seemed that my product was contaminated and that these things happen! Happen to who?!!She continued to say she could send me free boxes or some coupons if I would provide my address.I informed her that the last thing I want is an other box of this stuff in my house and hung up.DO NOT BUY!
5,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent alternative to the ""real thing"". If you don't have time to prepare the ingredients from scratch, this is a great substitute. Being Creole, I am an expert on Louisiana/Cajun spices. This mix is pretty close to the real thing. Even though the box calls for one pound of meat, I recommend using 1lb of sausage, 1lb of shrimp or crawfish tails, and 1/2lb of chicken. Laissez Les Bons Temp Rouler!!!"
3,Should have gotten a smaller pack,"It's an OK product, but we got tired of the taste after 3 packages and the rest just sits in the cabinet."
4,A Prince cover and more!,"For the most part this Cd is great. Lite modern rock with a few upbeat rockers thrown in. For the rockers theres The Emporiors New Clothes and I Am Streached On Your Groove. they really stand out. on the lighter side. Sidead's Cover of the Prince song Nothing Compaires 2 U was one of the best singles released that year. The song had it all. Emotion, Tenderness and above all you could hear the pain in her voice. a job well done. there was one let down. The closer is an overlong song with Sinead just singing. No music just her singing. It's too long and very annoying. That song cost the cd it's 5th star. aside from that song is album is brilliant"
3,Transcends trite,O'Connor gets by mildly generic early 90's production and Marley-Redemption Song-itis with strong vocal convictions that usually incur emotional pull regardless of much stale composition.
4,Beautiful in an unusual way,"Nobody sings the way Sinéad O'Connor does. Her voice is fragile yet aggressive, her lyrics are poetic yet controversial. Her mind is sad yet aware.Each song on I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (such an uncommercial album title would only work out for Sinéad) has its own soul, its own story, its own sadness. Beautifully sung by the Irishwoman, and in a way that no cover version will be able to keep up with the depth that she has put into it all.A unique album that is very hard not to be touched by. It will always stand as a legendary album."
5,"Irish Folk-Rock Torch Songs? Yeah, it works.",Sinead is a great modern example of underdeveloped beliefs obscuring stunning talent. This is her masterpiece. 'You Cause As Much Sorrow' and 'Last Day of Our Acquaintance' stand nicely with the best of Billie Holiday and Nina Simone within the Torch Song cannon of the 20th century.
4,Husband's Surprise,"I bought this gift for my husband, who is a huge Andy Griffith Show fan. He hates to play games because he loses at them most of the time, but this one he won with no problem. It is a lot like a Trivia Pursuit type game and you really learn a lot about the Andy Griffith Show.The game was in very good condition. Except for a couple of small cracks in the game board, it was perfect."
2,Not much fun,"First off, we're big fans of Andy and the gang.Just not fans of this ""game"".Granted, they have tons of trivia questions, some of which you'll never guess even being a fan of the show.But they could have done a lot more with this product. It consist of bascially trivia cards, dice, tokens and a very bland board.There is no game fun to this product. No ""Go back 10 spaces"", ""Go ahead 10 spaces"" ""Lose a turn"" or anythingThey could have at least made the board to look like Mayberry, and have the Courthouse with corresponding questions, Floyds Barber shop with questions, Lake Myers etcVery disappointing"
1,Tan flat,"I don't think that I have ever worn these shoes. I ended up not liking the style and they aren't very comfortable. If you purchase these shoes, I recommend getting a heel guard."
4,The Original,"This 1986 book has spawned many children, as some reviewers have noted. I read Visser's book because it was, as far as I know, the first of its kind. The book is structured around a chapter for each ingredient in a common dinner, a technique that was highly original in its day. The content is very detailed, sometimes too much so for my taste. For instance, the early chapter on corn contains much information that has been restated over the years to the point where it has become common knowledge. As a result, her treatment of corn's history feels like overkill. But it was a fairly ""new"" subject for general readers in its day. If you are interested in the history of humankind's interactions with foods that are common to America's dining table today, then Much Depends On Dinner is an excellent place to start."
4,Fascinating culinary lore!,"If you enjoy learning the trivia about the basics of your daily existence this book will amaze you! Who ever dreamed that corn was so omnipresent in our lives? That white food was associated with mildness and innocence and is considered appropriate for children and sick folks? That vegetables and salads were considered female foods, unnecessary luxuries for men, right up until the 20th century? You'll be quoting tidbits from this book over dinner for months!"
4,solid southern,Excellent obscure southern rock. Tight solid band. Well worth purchasing as well as their first cd. If you like Hatchet you'll love these guys. Highly recommended.
4,A silly and fun read,"This was a cute book, I picked it up for lazy days but it really sucks you in. Sometimes the author comes off a bit arrogant (considering she wanted the job, and doesn't quit). Best of all, you can figure out the stars shes writing about by doing a bit of fact checking!! Nice peak behind the curtain."
5,Classic Fading Captain Series Must Haves,"The Fading Captain Series was a dream collection of material from the majestic song craft of Robert Pollard's Guided by Voices machines. Bob is a catalyst for the rock music soundtrack of your life. Yes, you! Unless you hate late 60s British invasion influenced psychedelic power punk pop. Then go back to your Radiohead and Dave Matthews Band innocuous nightmares. If you do like spectacular and original rock tunes and shows, then buy all this stuff you can find. I did, and it motivates me to work harder and earn more money to pay for the near constant stream of output. None of it sucks, but if maniacal record buying is not your cup of tea....get lost. Beat it.This one is hard to find as well, so execute on your intentions before you loose out. You will never take this out of your car, unless you sell it. The car newbits."
2,Just OK,"This bullet box worked ok I suppose, but not for what I wanted. You have to be a very long distance away for this to be used safely (manufacturer reccomends 100+ yards) so no pistol training here. I did try it at about 10 yards just to see, and after the first shot I was hit in the face with hot lead that came from the box. Upon closer inspection the .22 almost penetrated the steel back of the box. Again, might work well for long distance rifle practice, but don't plan to use a pistol."
4,"revised - parts showed up, after wards...???","the body of the Bullet Box were all there, but all the hardware was missing, now, I have to contact the company and ask them for the pieces that are missing - not a good thing at Xmas. I didn't find this particular problem w/ any of the other reviews...well, after I contacted Amazon to return the product, I suddenly got a phone call from the company, and they finally showed-up... funny, after I called them repeatedly and could not get a response...oh well, all things are good now...God bless the USA."
4,bullet trap,"I would like to see one able to accommodate a larger caliber than a .22, maybe up to a .38. Also it could stand to be a bit larger in diameter. It does work great and I did know what I was getting when it was ordered. Will recomend it..."
3,Do-All 22/17 Bullet Trap Review,"Great for 22 S, L, or LRs. The 17 HMRs will eventually punch a hole if shot at close range (in my basement at 20 yds). I have two because the manufacturer sent me one for free after a hole developed and I complained. I welded two 3/8"" AR400 steel plates on the inside of the backing and now they can handle most lead pistol bullets. For a 17 HMR the trap must be set to 100 yds where the energy has dropped enough not to damage the trap. The plates I added for $15 each roughly make the traps twice as heavy but they are now more useful."
1,Its a trap,"The only reason I didn't send it back was it is heavy to ship back. The company obviously went to the lowest overseas bidder for construction, and I got what I paid for, a trap that had gaps in the metal due to poor quality workmanship. The pieces did not fit tight at all, I was glad I had a welder to fill in the 1/8 inch gaps in the metal. I repainted it and now sits on my bench were I shoot at it all the time. Wouldn't recommend the purchase to anyone unless they have access to a welder."
1,Open box....poor fit,obviously returned by someone else because of poor fitscrew holes did not align
3,no indoor use,"planned on evaluating 4 10-22 barrels for accuracy with 15 different bullets in my basement. when it arrived, the box says 25 yds minimum for .22I don't know whether to reinforce it or give it away. wish this would have been in prelimary info."
5,Fantastic!!!,This doll was purchased for my 2 1/2 year daughter. She loves to play with dolls that have hair so she can brush it and put it up. We have one other corolle doll but it is the baby. She loves that as well but is now getting into the dolls with hair. I wanted to get one from Corolle since the quality is unbeatable. I went with the Poupette because of the size. This is an adorable doll. My daughter loves it and has to take it wherever she goes. The hair is so soft and you can do just about anything to it. Highly recomend and I'm planning on purchasing another Poupette to add to the collection. Love all Corolle products!!!!
2,Not a first choice,"The constant ingredient in most recipes in this cookbook is maple syrup. While using maple syrup in recipes is not unusual for vegan baking, needing it for most of these recipes tends to get outrageously expensive. It's not my first choice when reaching for a vegan dessert cookbook. There are NO pictures in this cookbook.I prefer Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World."
2,Meh,"The cheesecake is the only recipe in this book that I actually liked enough to make again. The brownie recipes turn out like rubber and the cake and cookie recipes have twice the flour and half the sugar as normal recipes, resulting in dry, flavorless things. I keep trying new recipes hoping there will be a redeeming quality in this book, but I have yet to find one. Any dessert recipe by Isa Chandra Moskowitz has turned out delightfully. Or I just find a non vegan recipe and veganize it with similar ingredients. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Just bad,"I was so excited to buy this book since I've been vegan for over 10 years and I have a HUGE sweet tooth. Unfortunately, it was horribly disappointing. I have only found one recipe out of the many I've tried that was actually edible (and even that recipe had to be modified in several ways before it tasted ok). The book is riddled with typos, missing ingredients/information, etc. In many cases, the ingredients are not listed in the order used, which I find very irritating. More importantly, almost all the recipes I tried were awful. I tried to make the fudge recipe for Christmas, and it was indescribably terrible. It almost broke my blender, was a disgusting pale color, tasted horrible, and had a bizarre consistency. I had to throw the whole thing out. I honestly don't even understand how such awful recipes could have been published."
1,"awful. As a long term vegan and baker, I threw this book out","I ordered this book as soon as it came out (years ago). I was so hopeful... It's awful. I couldn't believe how awful. I've been a vegan for 10 years and an avid dessert maker. I know good vegan desserts, and these are NOT good vegan desserts. I tried a good 10 or so before giving up entirely. I honestly don't know when I've felt so betrayed by a cookbook. I recycled it (instead of donating it) because I didn't want to poison other people's impressions of what vegan baked goods should be. Avoid this book at all costs."
4,Sin-sational,"This book has proven itself to be an important book for my vegan library. I was initially trying to find Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, but it wasn't in stock when I was there. So, rather than leave empty handed, I picked up Sinfully Vegan -- and, obviously, I'm glad!So far I've made the Cinn-sational Apple Cake and the Orange You Glad There's Chocolate Cake (or something to that effect). Both of the cakes were easy to make and delicious. The first cake I made, the orange cake, was a little dense, and they left out when to add the chocolate chips, but otherwise was really good -- I love orange and chocolate together. I made the apple cake for class, complete with vegan-haters, and everyone seemed to enjoy the cake. At least, if they didn't like it, they lied and told me they did.This is a book everyone should have in their kitchen, even if you're not vegan, because you may have the desire to bake for one someday... and what better way to make an impression?!"
5,Mmmm...(cheese)cake,"The ""cheese""cakes in this book are incredible. They are on-par with what you would order from a bakery. I looking forward to trying out the doughnut recipies.A nice feature: there are flags on some of the recipies for non-wheat desserts, for anyone who has wheat sensitivity.I would condsider this a must-have for any sweet-toothed vegan."
1,"awful, awful, awful","i will definitely be selling this at my next yard sale.this book gives veganism a bad name. i'm actually afraid to sell it at the yard sale, because i'm afraid i'll just be furthering the belief that vegan food is disgusting and bland. not to mention, the textures of these recipes are all wrong.i am afraid to try any other recipes, because i don't want to waste any more good ingredients."
1,Not Healthy,"I had high hopes for this book, and was excited when it finally came in the mail. I Soon found out that this book does not contain healthy desserts. The recipes call for white flour, white sugar, and fake foods such as soy cream cheese. As a macrobiotic baker, it is possible to make desserts that are both healthy, delicious, and whole grain to boot."
1,Disappointing,"I am an avid baker and vegetarian. I have recently begun experimenting with vegan desserts. I tried several of the brownie recipes and a cookie recipe in this book. They were all awful (poor in both taste and texture) and had to be thrown away. It is unfortunate to have to give this book a bad review, but I would hate for other people to waste their money as I did.I would recommend the book ""The Artful Vegan"". There are excellent dessert recipes in the back (using mostly unprocessed ingredients). The German Chocolate Cake recipe in there is outstanding."
1,Peanut butter cookies,"Let me warn you that the recipe for peanut butter cookies in this book is BAD. I made these and they came out really dry and tasteless. If you want a truly delicious recipe for vegan peanut butter cookies, as well as other treats, then buy Dreena Burton's book Vive le Vegan. Now that's a good cookie!! As a vegan I refuse to compromise taste and texture when it comes to baking, and I won't recommend a book just because it's vegan. It's really important that veganism not have a reputation for bad cooking. It IS possible to make truly delicious vegan treats, so if you aren't finding the right recipes, keep looking, and don't compromise!"
2,Nothing to rave about,"I bought this book because of the great reviews on this site but have been a bit disappointed. The cakes that I have made have been much too dense, almost wet and the chocolate chip cookies were gross. The cream cheese icing is way too soft even after refrigerating it for 2 days. The only good thing I have made from this book has been the cheesecake (yummy!) and the chocolate frosting."
1,Yuck!,"I've tried a handful of recipes from this book; all were gross. I am unwilling to waste time and ingredients trying any more. I have had much better success with vegan desserts from Peter Berley, Myra Kornfeld, and Isa Chandra Moskowitz. I cannot recommend this book. In fact, I recycled the book because I thought it unkind to pass it on to anyone else."
5,Must Have Vegan Book,"Sinfully Vegan is a truly awesome book. The chocolate frosting is to die for and the yellow gold cake is amazing and moist. Tasted just like the yellow cakes I used to love. I recommend this book highly for every vegan/vegetarian interested in amazing treats. I must have spent hours simply reading the recipes drooling at the mouth. I honestly cannot decide which one to make next, they all sound so scrumptious. I have over 20 vegan/vegetarian cookbooks and this one filled the decadent dessert void brilliantly. I am immensely pleased with it.If you are a vegan or have a vegan friend, BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"
5,Love these recipes!,"After having many recipe books where I use perhaps one or two recipes on a regular basis, Sinfully Vegan is the first where I use many! Everyone I have tried is delicious. Its so nice to be able to eat scrumptious desserts without dairy. I recommend this book to anyone who asks about my favorite vegan cookbooks."
2,Not so great,"I found the recipes to be overly complicated and not very healthy. For creative vegan desserts that actually have food value, I like Great Good Desserts and More Great Good Desserts by Fran Costigan."
3,Too processed,"I have been a vegan for about 4 years and have recently looked to expand a somewhat limited number of good dessert recipies. Unfortunately, I found this book to be full of processed ingredients like vegetable shortening, white flour, and margarine. In addition, the few recipies I tried all flopped - and I follow exactly. Other vegan cookbooks offer great desserts,that turn out every time, and don't rely so much on processed ingredients. Try Millenium, vegan planet, or vegan fusion cookbooks instead."
2,worst recipe for chocolate chip cookies EVER,"Although I really love the premise of this book, I have to agree with a previous reviewer indicating that this author has limited background and basic understanding in baking. The recipes rely way too heavily on maple syrup and some of the recipes just turn out AWFUL. I made the chocolate chip cookie recipe. They were so bad I could not eat them. It tasted like dough drenched in maple syrup.Save your money and go buy some treats heretheir vegan chocolate chip cookies are to die [...]"
1,Very disappointing,"I received this book as a gift. I jumped into trying some of the great-sounding recipes. Each one I tried more clearly showed the sad truth that this book is full of false promises. As other reviewers have noted, some of the cakes are inedible. I love to bake and make some excellent vegan desserts. None of them came from this book. Spend your money elsewhere."
3,Not bad for the price.,"I love flannel sheets in the winter. These have a nice design for male or female. Even though they aren't the best I've seen they are still pretty good for the price. I haven't washed them yet so I don't know how they do in the drier, etc. Worth the money!"
5,Great Value,I found this product to be of high quality. I bought the sheets for a gift and was so pleased I purchased another set.
4,nice,I bought quite a few sets and have washed one set at least 3 times and have not had a problem with them ripping on corners or anything. They are a little on the thin side but what would one expect for 8.99? I am pleased
1,worst dvr I've ever owned. Hands down.,"The main reason I dropped DirecTV is this piece of equipment. DirecTV used to license their dvr's from TiVo, but started making their own product in 2004 I think. The unit required reformatting on multiple occasions and then just died. DirecTV sent me a replacement which did the same thing and promptly died on its 95th day and it had a 90 day warranty.I switched to Verizon FIOS in 2007 and have had the same HD DVR since then, and it still works fine, so in retrospect, my 1-star rating on this DirecTV garbage still holds true."
2,Rips easy.,We bought this for our 6 year old daughter who asked for one for Christmas. It ripped within the first week.
5,A Beautiful and Inspiring Gift,"I've enjoyed reading these excerpts again and again. This book makes a great gift for anyone who is a fan of Khayyam's Rubaiyat. Yogananda's interpretations and paraphrases add new meaning and life to an old classic.I quote one here, from Stanza 6:""God is Eternal Silence. To those who love Him purely He speaks through the voice of silent intuition."""
1,A PARAPHRASED EDITION,"In editing the commentaries of Yogananda, JD Walters has lost a lot of the beauty that his master was bringing out. Most of the master's wordings are completely changed. Instead of normal editing, this work contains a mass paraphrasing and watering down of Yogananda's fine work.Also recomended:WINE OF THE MYSTIC, by Paramahansa Yogananda,(SRF publishers)contains a very beautifully edited true representation of the masters expressions.Plus many commissioned works of art and a unique forward."
4,A good read,"Sex is the first priority with this book. The plot was decent, it didn't leave any holes or have you saying,""why did she have sex with him?"" You understood why the Louise did the things she did. The sex was definitely first rate. ""Searching for Venus"" is the kind of book you want to read in a nice warm bath."
2,Not goood enough,"While somewhat entertaining from a plot standpoint, the sex scenes were quite vanilla and didn't go very far. This book is best for those relatively unfamiliar with the Black Lace series."
5,Would make a great movie,"Part Larry David, part Office Space, part The Job From Hell, this entertaining and informative story really captures what it's like to work at a large company. Could not put it down. Highly recommended."
4,"The usual, for a Delorme atlas","Like other Delorme atlases, this is nicely detailed - though like other atlas, it can be annoying to use when you have to move from one page to another to follow a route. We also purchased (on Amazon) a Martinsburg - Charles Town - Eastern West Virginia road map that would be a better choice if you are looking for something to use while driving around Eastern West Virginia."
4,Where is he now????,"I also picked this disc up many years ago in the ""bargain bin"", And I echo the sentiments of the other reviewers, this is gtreat rootsy stuff.My question being, how can you produce a debut album this strong and fall off the face of the earth?? Nick, if you're still out there, give us another one!!!!!"
3,S.N.A.K fires up!,"Sensitive New Age Killer (S.N.A.K) is a classic little film. Director Mark Savage has created a dark,weird little world with some very sick, twisted characters. Highlights for me were Frank Bren as ""the Snake"" and Kevin Hopkins as ""George"", both of which had me in fits of laughter with their demented antics and equally sick dialogue.Some great action too in the style of early John Woo, especially a shootout early in the piece in an old abandoned train carriage. Very nice indeed."
5,"Finally, a framework to intelligently discuss political science and economics.","Most people who get politics don't get economics. And most people who get economics don't get politics. The Member of Congress and the professional economist are, with rare exception, very different creatures that inhabit very different worlds. This is the one work of social science I've seen that has the theoretical and empirical chops to bridge this gap. Ostrom does this clearly and concisely by drawing on her extensive field experience, the results of game theory lab experiments, and building a framework around adding a delta to the explicit payoffs of the prisoners' dilemma problem to represent common sense contextual factors.Brilliant throughout, the framework and supporting empirical and theoretical material are incredibly powerful and relevant for any social scientist or policy analyst who wishes to maintain a practical orientation without sacrificing theoretical rigor."
3,Bizarrely insighful garbage,"The genre is garbage. The obvious plot of the book is garbage. The characters are over-the-top garbage. Still, Hunter (is that your real name, Jack? Jack D. Ripper is more believable) writes with an educated hand and inserts enough humor and accurate observations of human nature to make this book, for moments, transcend its garbage status. Then you're back to the bread and butter of this genre, which is shifty Soviet agents, cynical Germans, dangerous sluts and lots of lurid and very cheesy violence. I cannot claim this book is other than garbage, and from a garbage genre. It has no redeeming features to its plot or characters. Still, the writing is good enough, if you're going to read garbage from this garbage genre (as many of you will) this one is a droolingly hilarious secondhand find. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes garbage written by ironic, overeducated slackers like Jack D. Hunter, who is probably a housewife named Priscilla from Minneapolis."
4,true old school west coast,"the last we heard from jj fad this was'nt a bad cd but good and dr. dre's production is top notch asd usual and you miss the old days of rap get this along with compton's most wanted, rodney o and joe cooley, and l trimm hell even sir mix a lot b4 he started making booty tiunes."
3,It was ok,The book was ok. It wasn't the greatest. I didn't really like Molly I found her to be whinny. I liked reading more about the history.
4,Excellent insulator; quite fragile,This tumbler does exactly as advertised: the glass remains cool to the touch even while holding boiling water. The only negative is that it will break easily if tapped with any hard object..so be careful with it!
5,Another Bodum Great Glass,These glasses are GREAT as nice and functional as all the other Bodum line AND... they can stack.
5,Thermo Tumbler,Very pleased. It keep ice from melting over a long period. Great for that mixed drink. Temperature of liquid stays steady for quite a long time. Great1
5,10 years using this calculator and still working,"I have had this TI-30Xa for at least 10 years, still using the same batteries. Simple and works great."
5,A very logical and friendly calculator,"As a mathematics instructor in the computerized machine tool industry, I have trained thousands of students since 1989 -- all using the TI-30 calculator (model numbers having changed slightly through the years). It does everything necessary in my industry. I have created several ultra-simple ""button-pushing"" charts, for use with the TI-30 calculator, and the students all learn trig and conversions with ease.I'll use no other (especially for the price!)"
3,not as good as they used to be,This replaced an old Ti30 solar that no longer functioned. I prefer the old one but as long as the trig functions work it will do.
2,not in the condition it said it was,"the calculator was in poor condition when i got it. even though the reviewer said that it in good condition. however you get what you pay for, so the price is fair for what i got it for."
2,Terrible keypad,"The terrible keypad on this calculator ruins all of its good points for me. Keys are sloppy, don't provide any feedback and are very easily bumped without knowing it. The calulator has a great price for a nice basic scientific calculator. It perfoms all of it functions flawlessly. Replacing batteries is easy. I just can not stand using the thing because of the horrible keypad."
3,Texas Instruments TI30XA,"This is a basic scientific calculator. It gets the job done. There is a few things I don't like, such as having to type in the negative sign after the number, and that the screen does not have two lines to work with, but otherwise for the price, you can't go wrong."
3,Not the same product....(3 1/2 Stars),"This is the second TI-30XA I have owned. The one I owned before lasted 6 years and I was happy with the product; so happy that I bought the same exact product. This current one that I bought just about three months ago is not any good. It went dead on me after only 6 weeks! I was really hoping for the same great product, but I guess they have went downhill such as many of my favorite items. If my new one lasts half the time as my old one then my rating will go up-yet, we will have to wait and see."
1,Terrible Product.,"This product stopped working after just a month and a week.Just about the time warranty was over ,oh well."
5,GREAT PRICE,"THIS IS EXCELLENT PRODUCT, THE PRICE IS LOW AND I GET ALL I NEED IN THIS SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR. IF YOU NEED ANY SCIENTIFIC CALCULATOR YOU MUST BUY THIS TEXAS INSTRUMENT."
3,Good calc,"It is a good calculator. In High school it helps you with everything in math (Fractions, exponents, +/- numbers, but this year I have had over 10, one the battery went out, another the 0 and 8 stoped working, some stolen, one the screen cracked. But overall it is good"
3,"1st one faulty, 2nd one ok",The original calculator I received became faulty within 1 week of use. CambridgeWorld sent me a new one to replace it in 2 weeks.
1,Piece of Garbage!,"What a piece of garbage! Yet another faulty product made in China. Texas Instruments should be ashamed. After only 4 months, the calculator failed. It has no reset button or battery chamber to easily rectify a problem. I took out all the screws and found out the case had been glued together so there was no way to fix it. The problem that manifested itself was that the display was on, the keypad was frozen, and it would not shut off. Piece of garbage!Texas Instruments TI30XA Scientific Calculator"
1,"Sent me the ""school edition""","I was sent the ""school edition"" of this calculator which is missing the 2 buttons on the bottom left of the calculator - the ""backspace"" key and the ""fraction"" key. This calculator is USELESS to me. It also came wrapped in bubble wrap...nothing else...not new..SCAM!!"
1,Robbed,I received the calculator promptly. After 3 days the calculator stopped working and right in the middle of a test I was taking! Don't buy used scientific calculators. Just go to Walmart and buy a new one. It's not worth the couple of dollars you might save.
3,Math,"It adds, subtracts, and clears, just about everything I needed, It even came with batteries! Far better than a broken abacus."
3,Ok,"This is a good calculator for simple calculations but I would highly reccommend the Texas Instruments TI30XIIS 2-Line Scientific Calculator. It has a two line display, which makes it easy to compare answers and formulas, and is powered by both solar and battery so it works in and out of the sun."
4,Small decimal point,Nice calculator but the decimal point is hard to see. Too small. Wish I'd known that before I bought it.
2,Over 40? Don't buy this calculator,"Decent calculator, but the decimal point is so small it's practically invisible. If you're over 40, forget it."
2,Can't see decimal point,"Similar to my T1 35 but I can't see the decimal point in the display. Unless you have 20-20 vision, pick another model."
2,A.W.F.U.L.-AVOID,"Terrible terrible song. What happened to them? I have almost everything by the Army Of Lovers and can't believe they actually did this song. The base sounds like some latest tracks, but the melody/song/lyrics is really awful. Really. The remix is a little better, but this is for die-hard fans only. If!"
4,For husbands female co-workers,"I bought these for my husband, becuz he bought real cigars for his co-workers but the females didn't want to smoke and with him being in Iraq I couldn't send milk chocolate So when I saw these I thought it was Perfect... Well They thought they were really good also too bad I didnt get to eat one LOL"
1,This was a horrible book!,"This book is so boring, the characters seem to not even know what's going on. They don't have a clue about anything, until the last chapter. This book was so hard to read because it was so boring. Sorry I'm being so harsh, but I have to recommend for people not to read this book!"
1,Blatant plagiarism,"This book blatantly plagiarises material from 'Engineering Design Methods' by Nigel Cross. Several design method procedures are copied word-for-word, and other chunks of text, wihout acknowledgement. [...]"
4,capsule review,"expensive, but does seem to help with the dog's dry skin problem,and persistent scratching during the heating-low humidity season."
1,Save the aluminum for something else,"A complete and utter waste of packaging. When I bought this originally, I was on a Henry Rollins binge--we're talking about 13 years ago, and the store in question advertised this as a 'Rollins Band' release. What a crock.This EP has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I mean, it's not hardcore industral a la Neubauten, it's not spoken word, it's not ambient noise/orchestration like Xenakis, or even an experiment in spacial tonalities--the John Cage nod. It's just a bunch of rambling basslines and TV soundbites, conducted as some kind of throwaway with both Rollins and his then-bass guitarist Andrew Weiss (who he never got along with; I can't figure it out either).It makes a great coaster, or it might be useful as a Christmas tree ornament, but not much else."
3,"Great laptop lock, ipod lock doesn't work","I recently bought this lock so that I could keep my computer and ipod secure. I bought Targus because it is a trusted brand and I thought I would get everything that was advertised. The laptop lock is great - secure, easy to use, set your own combo - 5 stars. The ipod lock, however, does not actually stay in the ipod. I have tried it with two different ipods (one old, one new) that are compatible with the lock, and the lock just slips right out of both with only a slight tug. Luckily the set isn't any more expensive than a laptop lock alone, so nothing was really lost, but don't rely on this to keep your ipod safe!"
1,"A LIE, wrapped in a DECEIT, surrounded by a FRAUD","This book has spawned an entire genre of books, publications and videos, and also strongly influenced Dan Brown's ""Da Vinci Code"". But, at the end of the day, the truth ALWAYS comes out. Pierre Plantard, the self-styled ""Grand Master"" of the imaginary ""Priory of Scion"" who is at the very heart of this story, turns out to have been nothing more than a bitter old anti-Semite and an admitted fraud. If Baigent, Lincoln & Leigh could not deduce this (considering all of the investigatory gymnastics they claim to have undertaken) then their breath-taking credulity staggers comprehension. If they were parties to Plantard's fraud... well, YOU figure it out.Since the foundation is faulty, the entire superstructure of books, videos and wild speculation spawned by this fiction must also fall to earth. But this book DOES prove ONE THING: Some people will believe ANYTHING!"
3,Well ....,"It's too bad: the contents of this book are pretty okay, except for the fact that Scott Cunningham sort've sugarcoats everything. Not everything in magick is positive and good and warm and happy and fluffly and peaceful. Some of it is downright disgusting, evil, bitter, and cruel. That's just how it is. There must be a balance. If magick were ONLY positive and good, then we would seriously be unbalanced.Anyway, what I'm saying is that most of the book is good - you just kind've have the keep in mind what I said and make your own conclusions."
2,Un-impressed....,"I personally found this book to be a disapointment, save for the chapter on formulating your own, personal rituals. This book lacked some of the basic knowledge that beginners need to learn in order to be successful...for example,,effective ways to raise and focus your personal energies."
1,Poor book,The books views on the elements are very limited. I was expecting a broader scope than one of pure wiccan pseudo-elementalism.
3,Start Here!,"Cunningham is great at writing helpful guides for beginners on the path of the Goddess. This book is no exception. The spells are simple and the ingrediants are easily found. No climbing to the top of a maple tree to get the highest leaf to throw in a stream running east. =P Don't you hate that?! ;) This book is a continuation of Earth Power, but you don't have to read that one first. This book has instructions for doing spells using each of the elements. There are also spells that use snow and stars which is rather unique. Also, there is a chapter at the end on how to write and perform your own spells! This is refreshing because it truly does help when your own energy goes into your rituals. I would also recommend Wicca: The Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Cunningham. It is still my favorite of all time for beginners. Best of luck on your journey, and Blessed Be!"
5,Perfect,"Came in perfect condition, and sooner than expected. An excellent addition to any collection. Definitely a keeper. I would be confident in doing business with this company any time."
4,"earth, air, fire & water - scott cunningham","I havn't worked much with the elements, apart from inviting them into my rituals. This is an interesting read. I recommend this book if you are starting out in your magick path."
5,Perfect!,"I'm kinda new to this kinda stuff, but I always was interested by natural powers and magick. This book is a really good start for people like me. Really interesting to read!"
5,Earth Air Fire & Water.,"I got this book for a friend, she has enjoyed the other book by Scott Cunningham I have gave her for gifts. Have not yet to read this book, but hopefully she will share. She had stated that he is a very good writer on this subject and has made it very interesting for her."
1,skip it,"Earth Power is a fairly acceptable book that Earth, Air Fire and Water tries to expand upon and fails.Neither book is REALLY worth purchasing, but this one less so.His Wicca books are FANTASTIC, and these lesser works skate on the quality of those good ones."
5,"Another solid, beginners book of natural magick","Basically an extension of Eatrh Power, this book takes you through many of the same steps. New additions include Snow Magick. Recomended for those interested in exploring natural magick."
4,Works well,"This product works well. Our son was teething and we didn't want to give him tylenol every 4-6 hours, so we tried this. He took the beeds very well (disolve on the tounge) and within minutes he stopped screaming from pain. We liked that we could give it to him as needed every 20 minutes, but usually we only had to do a couple times a day. However, as we got closer to the teeth actually coming in, the product stopped working for him, so we did end up having to go to orajel. But for a baby who is starting to teeth - I would try this first."
4,Wonderful story!,I saw it years ago & I have been searching the internet for this for hours!It's based on a true story & the acting is superb. I loved it.
1,Died after second use.,"Mine stop working after second test.Didn't came with any instruction manual or any instructions whatsoever.In my experience this tester resulted in a low quality product.I returned it for a full refund.Thanks to Amazon, its service is awesome."
2,Bad,"I give it 2 stars because the lower digits didn't work.The lower digits are suppose to show you the +12V but it wasn't showing any known numbers,it was showing unknown characters. Besides this the device was constantly beeping (why?). Don't buy this product it's not worth it."
1,Almost worthless,"This item (or at least the one I received) is almost worthless because the power supply main plug will not fit into the tester, the tester socket is too tight. I tried for 15 minutes antil my fingers got sore. They could have spent 50 cents more on a better socket, but they didn't. You can test molex and sata power connections but you can't test the main motherbord connector which is the primary reason to buy it."
4,works as advertised but dont expect any help from the directions,This item worked as advertised. One feature I didnt like is that you have to hold down the power button to get any readings to display. It reads all rails correctly. The case is made of metal and is sturdy enough for frequent use. The directions are pretty vague and if you are not that savvy with computers it takes some figuring out to get it to work correctly.
2,CHEAP!,I did a test of one power supply to try it out. Then about a week later I tried it again and the second power supply I tested it died. I knew it died before trying it again because I could smell a burnt smell. Tried it again to make sure and yep its fried!. Couldn't get my money back since its past the 30 days AMAZON offers so I am getting a replacement. I wonder how long the new one will last....?
4,Coolmax 14909 PS-224 LCD 24-Pin ATX Power Supply Tester,"As a pc tech, you know that the tools you have define the scope of your skills and capacity for servicing the client. To that end you must have a ps tester in your tool kit. This unit is a handy device for quick and accurate testing of atx power supply's that you will encounter in the field. It's faster that using a mulltimeter and can deliver all the pertinant power stats at a glance with it's lcd display. I only gave it 4 stars due to the very tight fit of the 24 connector port. The plastic mold must be a little off. Great otherwise."
4,"Brilliant work, great pianist, lousy dresser","The back story is that Kastle was a child prodigy who became a bit of a punk - not in his music, but in his attitude. He plays with a unique style and flawless technique, and the music on this album is ""must have"" stuff. The label liked his talent, and his look - they thought it might help classical music appeal to a younger audience, which it probably did. Kastle has performed on a lot of college campuses. He is also an accomplished composer in his own right.I loved this album when I had it on disc. Now that is ruined, and I don't like buying music that way anymore. If you do, I highly recommend it. I just wish it were available for download."
4,"Ignore the cover art -- it's pure, good classical music","I agree with the other reviewer about the cover art. I suppose Kastle, or his manager, felt he needed a gimmick. But the fact is, he doesn't. He's a fine pianist with good technique, if at time a bit rambunctious. Selections include some favorites, like Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodie, Bache's Joy of Man's Desiring, and even Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue. He adds a few orchestral pieces of his own, which might be a little presumptious but what they heck -- they aren't Mozart, but they aren't bad. An interesting addition to a classical audio library."
2,This is a hilarious CD to own,"What's the deal with the packaging? Is there a side story? He's dressed up in leather, but it's all classical music."
3,so - so,"I was a bit surprised that the ""book"" is only a couple pages and a painting kit. Not cool. I think it should be advertised as a kit. The few pages that are there are fine, really good actually, but it definitely seemed like too little."
5,This album shows that Jose Cura is more than just a voice.,"This is a wonderful album which not only shows Cura's talent as a singer, but as a composer and conductor. He captures the feel of the music and passion of Argentina in his selections. His interpretation of Cien Sonetos de Amor by Pablo Neruda shows an ability to bring to music the intense feelings expressed in poetry. Even if you don't speak Spanish, the music alone is a joy to listen to. Let's hope Senor Cura takes on more projects like this in the future."
3,Had to grow on me,"Love the voice, but didn't like the overall selection of his music. If you like him alot worth it, if not pass."
1,Everysong's a loser,"Ok, obviously I hated this CD. I was looking for the radio version of Brother Louie and I got this. What the hell is this sh--? This is the kind of cheesy crap that caused the whole disco sucks movement. I've come to appreciate the music of many styles and generations but this is so bad I was embarrassed that someone might here me playing this in my appartment. It sounds as though these guys are trying(and failing miserably) to sound black. If you want to laugh or be disgusted, buy this CD."
4,"Excellent book for beginning umpires, coaches and players.","Easy to read and understand. I train 16 to 60 year olds to umpire and they all love this book. I could not find the factual errors referred to by another reviewer. I highly recommend this to your recalcitrant ""non readers"" who think they know everything about baseball!"
2,Egypt Globetrotter Travel Map,Egypt Travel Map (Globetrotter Travel Map)This is a good map but the bad thing is that after 5 days of purchasing it some misterious stains appeared in the map what makes me think that this map is not made from good quality paper
1,Beware Shipping Charges,"Sleazy shipping rates. For 6 cards = $27 shipping. You know where you can insert it. Oddly, Amazon also stocks this card, listed elsewhere for a dollar more. wtf?? Search ""Kingston 2GB Secure Digital Memory Card (SD/2GB, Retail Package)"""
1,Becareful buying ANY Juicy Juice,"Look at Juicy Juice GRAPE Juice. It has a nice PURPLE label. It says GRAPE JUICE. READ the ingredients.The #1 ingredient is NOT grape juice. It's APPLE JUICE. The same with their ""orange"" juice. It's NOT orange juice at all with its pretty orange label. It's APPLE JUICE. Watch your ingredients."
2,A big disappointment,"I was really shocked at this book (and not in a good way) after being impressed with his first three excellent books. The whole idea of this book is that a ""true female"" is willing to be and needs to be ""led"". I was really stunned when he stated that females can't create - only men can. Yeah, right. Carlos Castaneda and Don Juan beg to differ. While Mr. Mares does make some good points in the book - which is why I give it 2 stars instead of one - it reeks of the social conditioning that Carlos Castaneda, Don Juan, Taisha Abelar, and Florinda Donner-Grau denounced in their teachings. It also speaks volumes that Mr. Mares wrote this book instead of his nagual woman, Marianne. Evidently she cannot create. If you want to read about true females, read Castaneda's works and those of his cohorts, Abelar and Donner-Grau."
1,Truely a Myth,"If a woman believes that her true purpose is to follow the males purpose and that she in and of her right can not create anything new then this is the book for her. If she believes that she needs a males purpose to give her meaning in life/this incarnation then this is the book for her. If she doesn't believe females are innately creative and create a myriad things in many different ways this is the book for her. If she believes that women cannot lead and indeed should not lead because by virtue of being female these are qualities denied her , then this is the book for her. if she believes that a man is in the best position to tell her how to be female since , naturally she would not have access to that information herself then this book is an indispensible companion . Indeed if she believes that there is only one way of being female and it is that which Mares preaches in this book , then this book will ensure support for that myth."
5,what a delight,"I would like to give this book to many people if only copies were available at a reasonable price.I love this book and think it needs to be a part of every piano studio. The history of the piano is not well known, but should be."
5,BUY IT NOW!,"This book is incredible! It tells the story of how the piano was invented. It was actually an accident! It is historical fiction but it has a lot of neat facts incorporated in it. I stumbled upon the title online but when I went to check it out at the local library I came up empty. It was nowhere to be found, so I took a chance and purchased it. I'm so glad I did. I want to use it in a lesson plan for my future classroom to teach kids that ANYONE can be successful because they can with determination!"
2,dieux du stade: making of the 2008 calender,"highly disappointing. no frontal nudity, even by stars that have posed in the previous calender dvd. some nice men, a beautiful location but as i said disappointing."
3,Funny but..,"It is a funy and at the same time give you courage to live with the desision of being proud and feeling beautiful with your natural hair, BUT it could have been a litle bit more elaborated for example the essays .You find great material in many websites so you would expect that in a book is even better."
4,I can see why Rik had to leave Triumph,"I saw Triumph for the first time on their Allied Forces tour. Rik's performance was jaw dropping. That said, the direction Triumph was going before Rik left, and the songs offered on this CD makes it quite obvious why Rik had to leave. This isn't a Triumph album. Absolutely is Rik's attempt to put the 'ist' back into artist. There's a lot more texture and thought in this CD than anything Triumph released. It's pop AOR, and for that some people might complain. I don't mind though. If an artist can't expand their range and experiment, then they might as well fold up and retire. I glad Rik didn't retire."
3,No TRIUMPH for Rik here,"Aside from ""Saved By Love"" the songs on this CD are poor to weak.That said, the guitar playing is top notch! Anyone who knows who Rik is would buy the disc for the playing anyhow. Aside from the chicks who buy this for the quoted track, most folks probably will not enjoy this if they aren't guitar freaks. TRIUMPH fans will be let down by the weak songwriting.Bottom line, if you like great guitar playing pick it up, otherwise keep your money"
1,Poor product,"The ""fog-free"" aspect of this mirror lasted about 2 showers before I had to keep wiping it down between razor strokes. The radio is awful - bad reception and terrible speakers. About the only good thing is the digital clock. At least I know what time it is in the shower.After this failure I bought a Showertek Fogless MirrorShowerTek Fog Free Shower Mirrorthat hooks into the shower pipe so the mirror warms up and stays clear. Works much better. Get that instead of this one. (It's cheaper too)"
4,"arrived early, works well","when I bought it online, it said to expect a long time for delivery, that it would not come before christmas, but it came very early.it works pretty well, too. Sometimes it gets a little foggy, but if you just wipe it off with your hand, it is fine again."
2,Almost good,"Bought this as a gift for my husband last year. Liked the radio function. Unfortunately, radio reception was horrible (and we lived in Houston)and the sound quality was weak. The mirror began fogging up after a few months. It was trashed after 5 months, when splashing water, wiping down, etc., no longer helped. Still searching for the right mirror..."
3,Innacurate Description,I bought this for a Christmas gift for my husband mainly because it was described as having an alarm but it DOES NOT have an alarm.
4,it is very useful and time saving,"I got this from Bed Bath & Beyond (for $19.95) and so far I love it. This has proven to be a very useful item to me. Because I am now able to shave in the shower; and the adjustable fog-free mirror is a perfect addition. This comes with suction cups to mount it in the shower, or you can use the shower string and put it over the showerhead. And it even comes with a stand built in if you want to stand it up on the counter. I was able to get a very strong signal on the radio. I am picking up stations from both NY and Philly. I did have a little bit of difficulty getting the batteries in it; for some reason the clock will work with used batteries but the radio will not. Once I put in brand-new batteries everything worked fine. I recommend this to anyone that shaves in the shower because it is very useful and time saving. There is nothing about this that I would change."
2,"Nice radio, but eats batteries like candy","I like the radio itself very much. It gets nice reception. My problem with this unit is that it eats batteries like crazy. It takes 3 AA batteries and I have to change them about every 3 weeks. I feel like if I could figure out how to disable the clock, then the batteries would work better. I use the radio about 15 minutes a day (just while in the shower, right!), and that's not such good battery life."
1,Zadro Z' Rock It Shower mirror/clock/radio,This item is junk. The mirror distorts the reflection and I originally had trouble with the radio. It eventually did work but not that well.
2,"durable, but the mirror fogs","I've had it for two years and it frequently falls in the shower. It hasn't broken though, so the product is durable. The reception isn't great, but the mirror is practically worthless. With age, it ""fog-free"" quality has gotten worse and it is practically worthless."
4,Fun with the DVD,"This black and white DVD is called ""Vintage Striptease"" but there is no 'Bumb and Grind' here.Instead we watch a pretty female with beautiful breasts doing the simplest things to show those breasts in all thier glory. Worth a look."
3,misleading title,"Contrary to the title, this video contains no ""striptease"". The women all pretty much start topless. There is some removal of clothing, but not done in any way that could be considered ""teasing"". The videos are black-and-white with analog noise, appearing perhaps to be 1980's though the Amazon write-up says 1950's and 1960's. The original video had no sound. A monotonous and repeating sound track is added; that is, they used the same boring music for all clips. In its favor, the women are all quite pretty."
5,Used on a Surefire G2,"I bought this along with the 450 Lumen drop in LED for an old Surefire G2 I had lying around to cobble together a working weapon light.This pressure switch worked for me without any modifications at all. First thing I did was put it on my G2, made sure it functioned correctly, then dropped it into a sink full of water for about 3 minutes before trying it again. Nowhere on the packaging does it claim water resistance, but it still functioned flawlessly.Not that I'll be submerging my AR in a puddle for any lengths of time, but at least I know I wont have to worry about a little rain or even dropping it into a puddle accidentally.Best thing is....the price. I'm happy I purchased this one instead of a higher priced one.Only thing I dont like is the fact I cant find a country of origin on it or the packaging anywhere."
4,"Good now, gonna get better","Well, it starts out kinda slow, but to all appearances is gonna start heating up soon. Eclair is fantastic and Lumiere isn't too annoying, and Alv and Dvrgir are just dripping with coolness. This DVD does start pretty slow and the characters don't do too terribly much yet, but from the look of things Kiddy Grade is going to be terrific after a short while! (And watching Eclair try to arrest people dressed as a pizza delivery girl [who...er, delivers cross-galaxy?] is enough to make ME buy a DVD...)"
3,Kinda of Boring,I found this anime to be very boring in a way. This kinda of made me fall asleep.I didnt even get this one lol. Its ok but not the greatest.If you get this you might regreat it lol.
1,Don't even bother!,I bought this Anime after watching the Trailer for it and I got rid of it after watching 10minutes. It was just porn. I prefer Yaoi and what do I get? Some chicks throwing kicks around to show their underwear and shots that just zoom in on their underwear or their boobs. Don't ever buy this Anime. It's disguisting and degrading.
4,Diffrent,"Before I ordered this DVD I looked up information on it, read reviews,etc. The general rating was four or five stars. I found it diffrent. To start with, the episodes seemed slow moving as I watched them, but when I though back about them after, they seemed short and simple. The first three episodes didn't have so much fighting as the other episodes probably do but they are still not too bad. Included in the special features is the promo that ran on tv and it suggests that the series has some good fight scenes, and interesting things. The problem with this is that a lot of the things it showed are nothing like what I saw in the first three episodes."
5,Amazing sound for wireless headphones,"These headphones easily match the quality of any wired headphones I have used. They not only have excellent dynamic range and frequency response, they manage to produce simulated Dolby 5.1 sound that is hard to distinguish from ""real"" surround sound. They're relatively comfortable, with the ear cups fitting around my ears and a spring-loaded head strap. My only complaint is that the range to the base station is not as good as I had hoped. These are IR connected, rather than RF; the result includes better sound, but also the possibility of losing the connection if you pick up a paper and pass it between the headphones and the base station. Also, they are limited to about eight feet from the base station; my living room is a little bigger than this, and in one area the headphones tend to cut out. The quality of the sound, combined with the Dolby effects, make up for this in my opinion."
3,Mixed feelings,"The sound quality is excellent on these headphones and it really lives up to surround sound. The only problem is that if you move around alot the headphones cut out. Walking with them is out. Sitting reasonably still in your easy chair watching a movie they are great. But even with this if you move around too much (changing positions alot in your seat) the headphones cut out. If someone walks in front of you (even the cat) the connection is caught and it cuts out for a few moments. Make sure that the receiver is front and center and not in any open cabinet or obstructed in any way. This helps, though is still not perfect. If I had to do over? Not sure. Sound is fantastic when it works but I hate the cut-out and the feeling of having to not do more than slight movements in my chair."
4,Not bad but some signal break-up,"The sound from these headphones is very good. I have only noticed some issues with the signal breaking up including using them a normal distance from the base unit. However, it has not happened a great deal."
3,It's pretty good,"The surround works really good although the sound altogether is very hollow. I wish there was more bass and a remote option for the receiver. This product is from 2004, I wish there was a newer a newer model available from amazon."
5,Outstanding quality,These headphones have essentially the same quality as those that are wired (without the wire getting in the way). Good range and ideal for listening 10-15 feet away from your music or video source. Pricy but worth every penny that I paid at Amazon.com.
4,Exceeded expectations...,"This was purchased to allow either my spouse or I to use the entertainment/educational AV system quietly so the other can work, talk on the telephone or sleep.For our AppleTV there is a digital optical input with 5.1 surround on the transmitter which sounds fantastic on the headphones. For our PlayStation, there are L/R RCA analogue inputs on the transmitter that sound pretty good on the headphones. Both the AppleTV and the Playstation are connected HDMI to the Receiver for normal room speaker listening. When quiet listening is required, we jack the Pioneer transmitter into the headphone jack which automatically mutes the main surround speakers and select either Digital or Analogue for AppleTV or PlayStation.Another delighter is that a battery charger is built into the transmitter. A spare set of rechargeable batteries for the headphones are stored in the transmitter. So far, after 8 hours of listening, the headphone batteries have not needed a recharge."
4,Excellent Sound,"This product, in regards to the sound, is as advertised. The only problems I have observed are 1) The cup material is not the most confortable and 2) because of this, prolonged listening is not desirable."
2,Great Sound - Poor Execution,"These headphones have great sound quality. The transmitter is easy to set up. Switching from analog to digital sound has to be done maually. An inconvenience from your easy chair. It should have either automatic switching or a remote. The signal is infared so any obstruction will wipe out the signal. Just be aware that wandering pets can wipe out your signal, so transmitter location is critical. The unit comes with a digital coaxial cable and would be better served it it came with an optical digital cable. The onboard battery charger will only charge Pioneer brand rechargeable batteries. When they wear out you will have to buy Pioneer batteries at a current cost of $49.95 per each AA battery. The aforemention issues are the basis for my rating. The engineering around operation and maintenance these headphones could have been more intelligent."
5,Perfect for gaming or TV,"I was worried about these since I have a 50"" Panasonic plasma TV and some have reported these not working well with plasma, but in my case they work flawlessly. No noise, no drop outs, just convincing 5.1 surround sound for me while my fiancee naps in the next room.If you're looking for wireless surround sound headphones, these are the ones to try 1st."
2,Great but!,I have been using these ear phones for some time now and audio wise they are the best! The BIG problem is that their construction is questionable. I actually have two pairs and the ones I use the most just broke again. The first problem area is where they swivel above the ear cup. Both sides are now epoxied after breaking. Last night when I removed them the whole assembly where the head band enters the frame broke so now it's more epoxy.So for durability two stars is pushing the limit. For audio quality they rate 5 stars. I wish pioneer would offer the earphones only. I have been looking but have found no website that offers just the headphones.
3,handle with care,"pretty good headphones, but has some weakness ,they are very weak where the eae muffs connect to the heak band"
3,Good until continuos popping noise,"Bought in 2008 with my 60"" Plasma Pioneer!....worked great...to no pbm with plasam whatsoever. Now suddenly after 2 years started to have popping noise with redlight on and off on speakers after 5 minutes with no sound heard. Thinking to go to geek squad...see if if one of resisters or impedence got hot and burnt out.Otherwise good phones. Lil uncomfortable if worn for long,I have to take break after 1.5 hrs and comfort is the worst part. Irritates your ear skin as if cutting edeges.I am thinking to buy sennhieser 170,look good reviews,except no optical input,no dolby digital encoding etc... but seems they sound gread the way reviews are written.Bass is weak on pioneer. I had to take off my headphones for full thunder of movies as the deepness of a movies don't come while wearing these phones.You do hear sound clearly,though nowhere near cinema sound coming from my simple TV speakers Pioneer PDP 60""."
4,SE- DIR800C WIRELESS HEADPHONES,"HI, I,VE HAD THESE HEADPHONES FOR ROUGHLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS,THERE GREAT. I RECENTLY PURCHASED SAINTS ROW, AND THE CLARITY OF THE GUNFIRE AND SHELL CASINGS CLANKING ABOUT IS SURREAL.FOR MOVIES THERE ALSO GREAT, LITTLE THINGS THAT YOUR EARS WOULD NOT NORMALLY HEAR COME THROUGH CLEARLY AND REALLY ENHANCE YOUR MOVIE EXPERIENCE. I GAVE THESE HEADPHONES A 4 BECAUSE THERE IS A LITTLE CAUTION LABEL ON THE ADAPTOR WIRE OF THIS UNIT, TELLING THE OWNER THAT THE WIRE IS LEAD BASED AND CAN CAUSE CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS.WHEN I WAS SHOPPING AROUND FOR WIRELESS CANS, ALL THE SITES LEFT THAT LITTLE BIT OF INFO OUT. SO IF YOU BUY THESE WASH YOUR HANDS.THATS WHAT THE LABEL TELLS YOU TO DO IF YOU TOUCH THE WIRE. I KNOW IT SOUNDS PARENTAL OR CORNY. BUT ITS ALWAYS GOOD TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE. I RECOMMEND PLACING SOME SORT OF BAND OR COVERING OVER THE WIRE. LIKE ONE OF THOSE PILATES BANDS OR SOMETHING."
2,Excellent Sound - but IR Link is the weakspot,"Pro's: Excellent sound quality. Equivalent or better to Bose QC3 and Sennheiser RS 170 / RS180. Loved the Dolby decoding. Had it connected using two optical / coax links to my Bluray DVD and HD STB.Cons: IR link ofcourse is line-of-sight. That means even if somebody walks between you and the transmitter or you wave your hand, lean on the couch or turn your head, the sound drops out completely. Not acceptable in my situation since my AV gear is placed on the side and not in front of the seating/viewing area - so only one of the two IR recievers is recieving the signal. (The IR recievers are located on the two earcups).May work better with folks who place the transmitter directly in front of the viewing / seating area.Returned it after 24 hours."
3,Right for Fathers Day???,"I bought these headphones for my dad for Father's Day thinking they would be a great gift. He seems to like them but he has had sets in the past and I have to say the the quality did not offset the price. They were bothersome in the fact that we had to wait forever for the batteries to charge. But that would have been fine but what really bothers me is that if anything comes in between the headphones and the reciever the signal dies until the interuption is removed. I though you were supposed to be able to be a huge distance away and they would still work. Overall they were an ok gift I just dont think they were worth it overall, especially when i could have bought a comperable pair for far less."
2,"Great sound, but physically flawed","I've had these headphones for about a year. They are comfortable, and the sound quality is great. However, today, the headphones broke. It seems the swivel mechanism is a very tiny and thin plastic piece. If this piece were made of metal, it would be OK, but the plastic can't hold up. I'm not rough with these, but I didn't handle them as if they were made of thin glass either. It is physically a poor design, in my opinion as an engineer.This is too bad. The speakers and audio system are great, but the physical package is not up to the task. They need a re-design, badly."
4,Great wireless - decent sound,"I love the wireless, no hiss and no interference with my other wireless products. Can walk anywhere in the room and it works fine. Bass is a little lacking but the mids and treb are great. I sometimes hear the plastic ""popping"" against each other when I look down and up which is a bit annoying considering the high cost factor. Batteries last me about a week with me using the set an average of 2 hrs. a night 5 days out of the week. The padding around the ears works very well, I can tell someone is talking to me but have not a clue what they are saying at low volumes. Overall they are overpriced (299 when I bought) but a great set of wireless headphones. A couple of improvements and they'd get a 5 star."
3,Impressive but lacks too much to be perfect!,"Very nice price product. Still doesn't compare to Bose though. However, sound is clear and crisp. Cluttered at times with certain materials. (Video game console specifically) It kind of sucks that you can't adjust BASS or TREBLE. This makes for richer sound but without it--you get too much Treble sound--meaning--the sound is extremely high pitched. For example: Gary Thorn from ESPN on the game NHL 07 sounds like a mouse talking from some cartoon. In real life he has deep voice and on game. However, with these headphones, his voice sounds so high-pitch that it's very noticeable."
3,Somewhat troubling,"Purchased these several days ago and haven't yet gotten them to work with my AV system.Connected directly to a source component such as DVD player or HD cable box, they work great, but that's not really very useful since you don't want to go digging around the back of your component rack to switch cables around.When connected to the optical digital out on my Denon AVR 3805 receiver, they don't work at all. I'm still not sure what the problem is, but at this point they're pretty useless. Worse yet, I'm not sure how I'll figure out how to get them working.I'll be updating this review when I either return them or get them working right."
2,Beware!: Right earpiece very fragile and breaks easily.,"I have had 4 sets of these headphones and in all cases, even with careful delicate handling, the right earpiece brakes in the swivel. There is only a small very fragile plastic piece that holds them together. No home remedy, such as super glue, does not work on this. I keep getting these replaced either with Sony warranty or Amazon with out any discussion, but it is a pain to have to go thru the repair and replacement process every 2-4 months. The sound and performance of these headphones is excellent. Why Pioneer can engineer such great sound and fail to take care of what has to be an original design flaw that has had to be a considerable problem for buyers....I wish I knew. However, I will give credit where credit due...the warranty service and buyer return policies for WalMart as well as Sony are easy to deal with and you get very little discussion about getting a new replacement."
2,Limited range,"The sound from the headphones is great. However, the range is very limited. I put my hand up and it immediately blocked the signal from the receiver to the headphones and the sound would cut out. I had no idea that the headphones had such a short range. I thought that it would have the same capabilities of a cordless phone not realizing that technology isn't as advanced as I imagined. I would not recommend this product especially for the price you pay."
5,classic,"This is one of the best albums of the 90's bar none. It catches YND just before he was set upon by western moneygrubbers, like Spike Lee, resulting in the mediocre ""Eyes Open"". It beats most other African music in its variety and sophistication. This album alone makes YND one of the great world music artists alive today."
2,Too orchestrated and techno,"I recently heard Youssou N'dour on an NPR broadcast of a recorded live performace at Carnegie Hall. I was like wow. This man and his band are great. Great vocals, and great percusssion, and just super. So imagine my disappointment with this album, which completely lacks the qualities which drew me to the N'dour sound. My chief complaint is that the tracks are highly synthesized, lacking naturalness. He has orchestral segments (again synthesized) that are in disharmony with the Senegalese sound. The music is almost always on high volume and often at high speed. And I'm sorry to say there are moments when N'dours voice grates. What this guy needs to do is capture that Carnegie performance on disc. If you're in search of a more natural Sengalese sound with smooth vocals, try Cheik Lo's ""Ne La Thiass"" (produced by N'dour). I rate ""Ne La Thiass"" 4.5 out of 5 stars."
2,maybe for a kitten,"I ordered this, and the 25 inch burrow bed at the same time, thinking the 25"" would hold my older cat, and this would work for my younger, smaller cat. No such luck. The bed barely makes 17"", and is so over stuffed and stiff, I can't imagin any cat would find it comfortable.Not only would my younger cat not even attempt to get in it, she couldn't fit. She barely weighs 9 lbs, and a very lean kitty she is, but also a very long one as it turns out. She couldn't turn around, nor sprawl out as she likes to do on my bed. If you consider your cat even remotely 'average' sized, do yourself a favor and spring for the 25"" bed."
2,Not really a cave,"The 'roof' part of this bed is really flimsy. It will not stay up, so my dog just lies on top of it like any bed. Maybe cats will burrow into it, but the photos make it look like it's a bit more cave-like than it is. Construction otherwise is okay, but if you really want something your pet can crawl into, rather than on top of, keep looking."
1,Definately not the right size,"Bed isnt as big as it said it was, defiantely a smaller bed and if you have an small cat or dog 8 inches or longer then its definately not the bed for you, because it will be to small to fit them into it. I would suggest buying a different bed or a larger size even if you think you have a really small dog."
3,Design Could be Improved,"I added a decorative wire cord at the top to keep the hood up. My dog just prefers to lie on top, which doesn't provide enough warmth. This size is good for a toy dog, 5 lbs or under. The product is attractive. If your dog is a persistent burrower, he'll figure it out. Mine didn't."
2,stuffed too much,"There was so much stuffing in this bed that it was more like a round ball. I tried to ""flatten"" it by putting a 5-pound bag of flour in it, but that didn't work. There was no way a small dog would have been able to get into the bed and stay there very easily. I finally removed the pillow, removed the stitching to open it up and took half the stuffing out -- resewed and put back in. That was much better and my little puppy was able to get in the bed. I saved the extra stuffing to make a second pillow, either as a replacement or as a second bed if I get additional material to cover it.Don't know if mine was faulty and just overstuffed, but certainly wasn't very practical as it was received."
3,"Looked like just the thing for a cat nap to me, but my guys thought otherwise","My three cats--two of them under 10 pounds, one much larger and none of them notably finicky--showed no interest, not ever, not any of them. I tried it on the floor, on the bed, near their usual sleeping spots...I occasionally plopped one of them into it for a petting session, but my normally curious crew wanted nothing to do with it. Were it not for the fact that its velvety black fabric collected cat hair like a magnet, even though nobody used it, I might have considered the larger size. A week or so ago I donated it to some cat rescue people for their spring kittens."
1,too small for a chihuahua,i have a small chihuahua dog and i assumed this would be perfect size for her... and to my surprise this bed actually came up a lot smaller than i expected and my dog can barely fit in there i have no clue how a cat can fit in there.on the cardboard picture you get with the bed shows a puppy dog sleeping on it. OKAY no where on here does it show us thisnot recommended for average sized cats and description is misleading
3,Pet bed,"Get the largest of these you can. I bought the medium sized one for my 12 lb. dog and he was afraid of it. Not big enough to get under the top - not nearly as open as it appears in pictures. He's a little dog who likes to borough under blankets, but sure didn't like this. I gave it to a person with a cat, and even her smallish cat wouldn't use it either. Hummm - looked so good to me."
1,great for my 4lb chihuahua,My 4 lb. Chihuahua loves this bed. She loves to sleep on top of it just as much as snuggled inside. I tucked a soft blanket under the top flap to make it even more appealing. Sometimes i can't even see her tucked inside of the bed!
2,Tiny,This bed is very small. My 7lb min pin doesn't fit inside. Returning and will try to find a bigger one. Used to have one and she loved it.
2,"Great idea, but runs small","I have a small 12lb dog and she could not fit in this at all. The concept is great, but the sizes seem to run small, and it seemed a little poorly made. Not bad, but not great either. Thankfully amazon let me return this without making me pay for the shipping - and gave me a full refund. We were able to get a round bed with suede on the outside and same fleecy wool type stuff on the inside at Meijer for almost half the price. The bottom bedding comes out so we just tuck one end of a nice fleece blanket underneath it, put it back in and it works realitively the same."
3,Too Long,I have read this author a number of times and enjoyed his books. This one is 541 pages of repitious dialouge. It was be a really good book if it was no more than 350 pages. The story line is really different and exciting at times but I started to get bored and now I can't wait to finish since I never put a book down once I start it
3,Killer cops and then some,"Tim and Dray's personal demons and pain are displayed in the first quarter of The Kill Clause. The writing in that section is visceral, drawing the reader in, making the pain and horror of losing a child to a violent crime feel real. The other three quarters is a strange journey through vigilante justice.The writing and story isn't as compelling or consistent throughout the book as it is in the first part of the story, but as the final chapters come rolling in, the reader is reacquainted with the driving forces that opened the novel."
3,Not a surprise ending.,"Sorry folks. I can't whole-heartedly endorse this book as everyone else has. I am scrupulous about reading cover to cover. This seemed to weave for hours, and finally I cheated myself and read the last chapter or two. And the ending I was expecting was there. Not a big surprise. After reading the end, I wasn't sorry I skipped the 100+ pages in the middle. He could have wrapped up a whole lot faster for me."
5,Exceptional book,I couldn't put this book down! It is really a well written and thought out book. I hope it makes it as a movie.
5,A great read,An excellent work of fiction. This book will keep you interested page after page. The characters are so well written you will be certain you know them from somewhere.Nothing more needs to be said. Buy it!
2,"Long on sermons and bad research, short on action","In short: all the characters are full of speeches and the action is a long time coming and not worth the wait. Politically, I agree with the author's observations about the current abuses and manipulations of our legal system, but for Heaven's sake, come at it with some finesse next time. Also, to really send the novel into the silly, the author needs to shore up some of his research. Case in point, a Glock pistol is not ""mostly plastic"" and will most definitely not make it through a metal detector save the barrel. In fact, the entire slide/receiver is metal, which accounts for close to a pound of the gun's weight, and will go off like a fire alarm (with or without the barrel)in any metal detector in the world. All in all, an amateur at work. -Mykal Banta"
3,Good lead character; but where were the editors,"Hurwitz creates some good characters--Bear, Dray, and Tim. However, the book is about 200 pages too long. The story had tons of potential to be a fascinating look at the Marshals and modern LA. It is neither. Instead, it is one long action sequence with some tear jerking thrown in. The murder is terirble and sad--Ginny's that is. Otherwise, the other characters are relatively two dimensional. Where were the editors? It seems the book was sold to Hollywood, which makes sense...it would be a 2.5 star action flick. Still, I hear the Program is really good...will I try Rackley again? Probably...I just hope it is better than this."
3,Not What I Expected,"After reading all of the highly positive reviews listed here, I expected a fast paced, thrilling read. What I got was the complete opposite. Having just lost his only daughter, Tim Rackley, a US Deputy Marshal is out to seek his style of revenge with the help of The Commission, a group of law enforcement professional who have shared the devastating loss that Rackley has felt. Soon, he leaves his life behind and dives into the murk of L.A. to begin a series of hits on criminals who have slipped through the system's cracks...including the man who Rackley believes killed his daughter.Although it's an interesting storyline, it wasn't as riveting as I expected."
2,Couldn't get through it,"Got through about 150 pages, but the story was just a bit too far fetched for my tastes. The reading went easy enough, but the ""Star Chamber"" theme has been overdone and seemed almost silly. Couldn't finish the book."
4,4 1/2 stars,"See synopsis above.First I'd like to say that Gregg Hurwitz has put together a well rounded thriller. Hurwitz's lead character Tim Rackley has lost his young daughter to a brutal murder. What Hurwitz has done well is portray the pain that Rackley feels. The emotional dilemmas involved with the loss of a child hits close to home to anyone with a child. Along with the strong emotions there are ethical problems that are portrayed in the story concerning vigilanteism. Right or wrong? With the novel also comes plenty of action. Put all together, you get a great story that will keep you entertained. It might make you mad or it might make you happy, either way it will make you think.The only negative I have is with the character of Rackley. I did not care to much for him. Maybe because of his views or because of his hypocrisy.Recommended"
1,A Very Poor Effort,"I suppose one needs to be cautious of items listed without dimensions or page counts listed. My first suprise was the small size of this very thin book. Nice color printing made me hopeful, but it cannot save a collection of dull, trite photographs.A handfull of images of true ""Rough Gods"" are joined by poor images of flowers, buildings and dead diva's tombstones, none of which make for very good photographs.Rather than a collection of ""Rough Gods"", this book is a jumble of amature photographs by someone with the connections to be published, but not the talent. Note that the poor images not featuring men are never mentioned in the reviews of this volume, and there are plenty of those in here. There really is no theam to this collection.Pull is a wonderful thing. I have seen references to this volume twice in national publications,and trust me, it is not worth the hype.Buy it and keep it because it is a signed first edition, but do not expect much from the photographs."
4,"OK, I really like this!","I am a fan of both artists and this is better than their last effort! Disc 1, LTD's Love Ballad and Sade's No Ordinary Love are done nicely....Figured it Out, Just A Dream (sing Chante!), maybe a couple others. Thank God for Disc 2 which brings it all home. Make's me wonder was it supposed to be a separate project produced by Fred Hammond? Songs-Rejoice, Make Me Like the Moon (love that!), Your Name, I Give You my Praise, I Do Love You, Mine all Mine and Never Alone makes it all worth buying! Their love for eachother comes through the music and lyrics.....i hope it gets good, worthwhile airplay!"
5,Back to the Basics,First I think Chante Moore deserves more exposure than she receives. She is a true SINGER. Kenny's voice is smooth and sultry. These two are a perfect blend. The CD is great! I like the balance of smooth R&B and inspiration. It is fullfilling to see a couple expressing their joy for the Lord in song. I recommend this CD!
2,FINALLY a CD for people that are in LOVE!!!,"Oh my goodness this is one the best CD's I've bought. Finally a CD you can share with the one you love (I mean really love). This is not for boyfriend and girlfriend love cute-sy stuff...this is for serious lovers til the end, no matter what. I ain't there yet with anybody, but boy does this CD excite me to know I will feel like that one day.To think it was only $4!!! I would've paid had I known how excellent it was. Kenny and Chante celebrate love and so do I!!!GET this CD now!! and dance, laugh, kiss and ""stuff"" with your loved one!!"
4,Great flick. Truly one of Wah and Liu's best films to date.,I really recommend this film to anyone who has seen any of Wah or Liu's previous films or merely wish they could. They will be grateful. This film really express Wah's inner ability to create subtext in the context of the intellectual mans wants and desires. And the subtitles are just excellent.
3,Not for freelancers!,"I expected this to be much more informative and specific. I did not read through much of the book, as it all applies to design firms. I am a freelancer who's never been good at the business aspect; plus I was out of the game for a few years and wanted to catch up pricing wise and via other aspects. This provided no information relevant to me, and more frustrating, it referred to the Guild Handbook several times for specifics. Well, the Guild book is totally out of date -- that's why I was looking for something more current. The fact that it is 'copublished with the Graphic Artists Guild' made me hopeful that it was the finally a current variation to the Guild book.What I read otherwise seemed like information that was very very basic, what most designers who have some experience are already aware of."
4,Valuable business resource,"I am quite surprised just how useful this book is. Everything is here from a single freelancer working out of his bedroom (and basic rules about taxing the bedroom) to a full corporation with partners who rent commercial space.Specific topics covered here are simply not found in general business books. ""How does one put a price on creative effort?"" This books describes the methods! My favorite part is the negotiation chapter, which empowers artists with techniques to stand firm (yet polite) against those unscrupulous businessmen seeking to exploit the artist. The chapter finishes with sample contracts--an unexpected bonus.This book does not get 5 stars because it is a business supplement, not an exhaustive resource."
5,A Small Chilean Gem,"A real pity movies such as this one never make it to the big screen in the USA. A Chilean take on the absurdity of war, or better still of a war that does not take place though it exacts two quite painful and unnnecessary casualties. I recommend it for anyone who uses film as an instruction medium, in spite of the sometimes salty language (the language of the common people)."
4,Good film,A nice movie that highlights some interesting dynamics between Argentina and Chile in the 70s. Recommended for anyone who enjoys South America.
5,What a book !,This is what I call a short story collection. McDevitt has the ability to charm his readers into strange territory. A Pied Piper figure that we eagerly follow into the story. But more than that he sparked my interest in some contemporary American literature. Worth reading and at a reasonable price. When it comes out in paperback I'll get a copy so that I can make it all tatty and foxed.
3,Uneven,"Of the 16 stories in this collection, I thought 4 were really good. These are: ""Black to Move"", ""Promises to Keep"", ""Ellie"", and ""Cryptic"". The other stories all started with some interesting premise but just didn't go anywhere; I was always expecting some kind of interesting finish that never came. I didn't bother to read the one longest (50 pages) story; I was afraid to. Nevertheless, the stories named above are quite good. I had thoroughly enjoyed McDevitt's first novel, ""The Hercules Text"", and still intend to try the ""Engines of God"" series."
2,Below Par Quality,"This one has a great selection of movie classics, but the audio is pretty bad! It sounds like they re-recorded these from an old, scratchy 45 or something. Disappointing! :("
5,Deceptively Powerful Book!,"I'm not a cancer survivor, but when I heard the author speak at a leadership conference, I had to get the book. Most of the conference participants in the room were in upper management positions at Fortune 500 companies. Every one of us was captured by Michael's words. The book is no less compelling. It grabs you on the first page and doesn't let go.For anyone who has never had cancer, it's a powerful read. I can only imagine how powerfully gripping it must be for anyone whose life has been touched by cancer. If you're not a cancer survivor, buy a copy and read it. If your life has been touched by cancer, buy three copies - one for yourself and one for two people close to you."
1,Aeriasl Assault thrower - disappointed,I ordered the Do-All Aerial Assault Thrower and received it in a timely manner. First time at the trap range the motor failed. Called D0-All about the problem and they were very prompt in replacing entire unit. The second unit I received I have had no motor trouble; however it started out breaking approx 90% of the clays thrown. Once this issue was resolved a bearing screw bent and was replaced. The bearing screw bent because the bearing didn't ride correct on the mating surface. Once this was corrected the micro switch at the front of the machine broke and needs to be replaced. I have only gone through three boxes of clays total. I have only used the thrower for less the one hour of operating time on the machine. If you love to tinker with newly purchased items this is a great item to play with. If you want a thrower that's works correctly you will need to spend the money to buy a quality thrower.
3,auto trap,"Works well after going through every nut, bolt and screw to tighten things. I also had to take the electric motor apart and put the bearings back into the proper their places because the set screw in the gear box was loose and allowed the shaft of the motor to move and the bearings to dislodge."
1,Do not buy!,"These traps are the biggest piece of junk, I have ever spent hard earned money on. At one time I had two of these things, new out of the box, and neither one worked. I had to return four of these traps before I could get one to work. I constantly have problems getting it to work. It's so bad, none of my friends will shoot with me. My friends just opt to hand pull with their hand pullers, so we can shoot on any given day. These things are complete jokes, and the company knows it. I've called for knew parts on defferent occasions, and received parts that were rusted or completely different, with instructions to rebuild the old trap with the new parts. Please, please do not spend your money. The sad fact is, when I bought these things, they were $500.00!"
1,Not worth the money,"Wait for when they release the full season in September. No point in buying half a season at full season prices. I still love watching Glee, but I will wait and buy the whole season when it gets released."
3,Problems With DVD,"I love the content. Shipping was fast, etc. But...there are several places in all 3 DVDs that skip and mess up. I have cleaned my player. I have no problems with any other DVDs. It happens at the same places every time I play them, so it has to be the DVDs. I'm disappointed in that. If not for that problem I would have given 5 stars."
