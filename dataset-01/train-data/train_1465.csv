1,I will trow it away,"Bought this fax machine for our small office and aftr 2 weeks a little pin that holds the cover broke and I can not read faxes, they wrote a fax support line in the fax and is always busy, I lost the receipt so I can not exchange it,.....Uses a ton of print film, (expensive) I will rather use my computer fax instead...."
1,A Poorly made Machine,"I agree with those that classify this as a""piece of junk""! A small tab on the left side broke off and the lid does not close properly. This is part of the entire bottom assembly which is is one piece molded plastic. The part is [an amount] but Panosonic tech people say it's almost impossible to replace unless you have training. They will fix it for [an amount]. plus shipping. What a deal. Ray Ferrari"
1,Durability Problems,"This is a decent machine marred by serious build problems. The quality of faxes sent & received is fine for a home office machine and the array of features is also fine. My problem is with the poor build quality of this unit. Unlike most Panasonic products which are generally durable, the construction quality of this machine is below par. I have experienced the same paper feed problem referred to by other reviewers whereby the machine thinks it is out of paper and asks you to move the flimsy lever to restart printing. It beeps loudly and annoyingly until you do this. My next fax will not be a Panasonic."
3,Acceptable for the price,"The quality of faxes are good and as readable as any other I have seen in this price range. The audio quality of the telephone and the speaker phone are good. The copy function works well, but is an expensive use of the film. I found it easy to get into Panasonic tech support, and they were quite friendly and helpful. There are only two complaints. First, the recorded outgoing message, when recorded through the onboard microphone, is quite poor. Accessing it remotely and recording the message through a telephone gave me better results. Secondly, it is so loaded with features and the manual so big it was a bit overwhealming to initially set it up."
3,"Dave Edmunds, One-Man Band","This is Dave Edmunds' one-man-band love-letter to the songs of yesteryear. It's interesting to hear him recreate the songs, instrument-by-instrument and voice-by-voice, but he never really transcends the originals.For those unfamiliar with the singles he's covering, or for Edmunds fans, this could be a real crowd pleaser. But given how many of these tracks are available in their original form (including The Chantels' ""Maybe"" and the Crystals ""Da Doo Ron Ron""), Edmunds lack of substantial reinterpratation (although this works to his ironic advantage in the gender-specific songs that he sings from the girl's point-of-view) leaves this disc a best buy for Edmundsphiles."
2,"Poorly produced, inferior Edmunds","This album features badly conceived remakes of classic pop songs, recorded in what was apparently supposed to be authentic period sound, but gives the impression that poor Dave is wailing from the bottom of a barrel (and off-tune to boot, on more than one track). If you've ever wondered what Phil Spector might produce while suffering from a monstrous hangover, try this one out.Tops on the ""what were they thinking"" list are inexplicable covers of ""Baby I Love You"" and ""Da Doo Ron Ron"". ""Let It Be Me"" and ""Maybe"" provide solid evidence that being a balladeer was not one of Edmunds' strengths. Even decent covers of songs like ""Let It Rock"" and ""No Money Down"" are weighed down by the murky sound.There are a few salvageable numbers like ""I Ain't Never"", but overall this is one of Edmunds' weakest efforts."
1,Terrible,"This is probably one of most regretted cd purchases of the past year. How American Beat Records decides on what to re-release is beyond me.A rehash of classic pop/rock, country and blues songs. He didn't even change the lyrics on one of the songs, so he ends up singing about going home with ""Bill"".I'm a fan of most of his work, but this I just can't bear. Hey, American Beat, who's picking these re-releases, a deaf monkey?"
2,head bent after 3 hours...,"Ok, so i bought this hammer thinking it would be the perfect match for my wonderbar prybar. After all, it is an antivibe design which i'd hoped would save my wrist, and is smooth faced (to save my bar).I started using it to strike the back of my prybar to get it under some nailed-in hardwood flooring.It feels amazing.Best hammer I've ever used.So there i was really happy with my brand new hammer ripping up this floor when all of a sudden it doesn't feel right anymore. I looked down at it and saw to my dismay that the head was bent back at least 15 degrees.I expected more from a steel hammer with i beam construction like this. Oh well, back to my fatmax wood handled framer i suppose."
2,HammerHead,"The hammer that is shown is not the hammer that is sent.Amazon and Stanley need to update their picture of the new hammer that they are selling on their websites.The hammer that they show is the one I want.The new anti-vibe hammer has a bigger hammer head and isn't as good as a conventional hammerhead,especially when toe nailing and hammering into tight corners.The only way to fix this is to have a machinist turn down the hammerhead to normal size.This hammer only gets 2 stars."
1,It rings with every strike!!!!,I thought this was my new hammer until I tried it outside one day. BEWARE!!! The tuning fork in this hammer rings with each & every strike on nails & etc. It almost made me a nervous wreck with each strike of the hammer. Maybe they fixed it by now but the exact 20 ounce model didn't do this. I think the extra weight tones out the tuning fork.
5,"guilty album is the shiznit,fo the real.","well,all I have to say is, that this album by yarbroughs & people is by far one of the best oldschool R&Bs ive heard,some peeps might not agree,but then again people dont have real taste in good music these days.Me being an 80s baby,I dig these jams,and wish music like this would be brought back to reality.The ladies,parties,good music,dancing,ahh those were the days.As for Guilty 1985, their are some top songs that I personally dig like Dont waste your time & of course the self titled Guilty are all the bomb,Be A winner is A tight song to.So for all you oldschool R&B junkies out their that love music,this cd is A must have,take it from me I know real music when I hear it.THIS ALBUM IS THE S**T.From your outstanding R&B collector Mardog82. OLDSCHOOL FOREVER BABY ."
5,Spy Kids,"We were so young. This is a Boomer Book, reminding us of Bond and Helm and now, if we didn't know, our brothers (and sisters) across the pond. My 15-year-old son laughs at ""Austin Powers"" and now I can show him where the whole damn thing came from.It doesn't matter if you're a fan. The reviews are quirky, enlightening, funny, and laced with references to what we remember even if we've let it slip a little. This is less a reference book than an overview of a difficult time when some really goofy things happened on film, some of them awful, some less so, some pretty magnificent. Even if you never rent or buy any of these films, you'll get hours of enjoyment from just reading about what it was. This is one for the library, or maybe the bedroom, or possibly the bathroom. The places you read."
4,Joan's Eurospy Guide Review,"I found the reviews very entertaining, with spicy language but dry humor. Even the movies that got dud reviews were fun to read about."
1,wasted money,this DVD is a collection of cave pictures with the video of Dr. Silvestru lecturing to a group. Very boring. His theories are hard to swallow and he presents very little background to support them. Total waste of time and money.
1,The worst shelving ever purchased.,"Bought two of the sets of this item. When you cannot put the parts together, or they fail to stay together under normal book weight, do not plan on returning them. They arrive in plastic bound wiring and it is impossible to fit them back together in a box. I threw mine away, for that reason, but mainly because they were unwieldy when moved, and impossible to keep together."
2,"Poor packaging, poor product all around","Got this product on Saturday, and I have to ay, NOT that impressed at all.Problem #1: PackagingI had to go through 2 boxes, ties and tape just to get to this product to assemble it. Yeah, that's far too much just to assemble something.Problem #2: AssemblyPoor manufacturing makes for a poor product. After about 1/2 hour, I got the thing put together, but it didn't even make it as far as my bedroom (50 feet, if that from where I assembled it).The product is sturdy enough, but these two negatives outweigh any and all positives."
3,"It's okay, could be better",The connectors don't really connect very well. I am finding that I need to keep pushing the cubes back together.
3,Buy some cable ties,"Because wire cubes had worked well in our IT gadget closet, I'd been hoping to extend the existing setup to fit all of the new gadgets and other bits and pieces. Unfortunately, these cubes used a different gauge wire and were about 1/8"" bigger, and the square units of one batch wouldn't stay in the connectors from the other batch. If you ever wondered why there are exacting standards for even the most mundane products, this is why.Even where the parts were all the same size, they were prone to pulling apart in one area while I was trying to pull them together in another.The only way I could get everything to stay together was to reinforce the junctions with a whole lot of cable ties.If you have an installation bigger than the 2 cube by 2 cube example photo, I'd suggest you do the same."
4,Great price,I purchased this to make a guinea pig cage. It was much less expensive and much bigger. I do agree that a few more connector would have been great but it's easy to put together. You can design it any way you want and it's inexpensive compared to cages.
3,Good Storage Space But.........,"This was purchased for a pantry to put large, light weight items (think paper towels, T paper). Works well, but the wire is thin and the clips do not hold. You have to use tie wraps to hold it together."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I had recently gotten a set of similar cubes from Bed bath & Beyond and was looking for another set. The BB&B set was about $10 cheaper and I was very satisfied with them. These on the other hand are worthless. The panels do not fit securely into the attachments (if you can get them in at all), and the unit disintegrated after I put in several light weight fleece blankets. I had to reassemble the panels using zip ties. Don't bother buying these."
4,Blind Willie McTell,"This is a good collection of Blind Willie McTell recordings. Personally I would have switched out a couple songs... but for the most part, great stuff. A good addition to any old school blues fan's CD collection."
5,Best Kennedy book ever,This one has it all. It has the best photos ever seen of the Kennedys. Lots of them are revealing and more personal than ever seen. There is a closeness that the pictures have that the same old ones somehow miss. Also it summarizes the story of this famous family compactly. The writing has depth and understanding.
5,A treasure of a book!!,"What a classy book that one is! The White House as it was at the time of the Kennedys... and looking at some of those never seen before pictures, we can relive the elegance, charm and grace of that unique period. Two thumbs up Mr. Sferrazza!!"
5,He's done it again!!!,"Carl Sferrazza Anthony's new book is ""top drawer!""He has once again created a read that is both interesting and informative! If you are interested in some behind the scene photo's as well as some behind the scenes info.....buy it!"
3,The Kennedy's in the White House,"There is not much of anything new here either in photos or in the writing. Basically the author has taken pictures from the Kennedy's time in the White House and compiled them into this short memoir.If you would like to read better histories about the life of Jack and Jackie Kennedy, then there are better ones out there that go into greater depth and also have the same photos.The author was a friend of John F Kennedy, Jr. and seems to have traded on that friendship to compile this short pictorial.If you like to look at the photographs of the Kennedy's during President Kennedy's short tenure in the White House, then this a good book for that. Not much insight into the family here and nothing here that you can't find in other books about the Kennedy's."
4,very good but unspeedy,thanks for amazon that deliver me the right item but not in the right time cause it took about a month and a week to recieve the book. anyway the book is used but it is really in a good condition. thanks again and i am standing ready to request another book now.
3,mastered from vinyl ... got any better ideas?,"Not the best remastering job in the world, but considering the master tapes are in the hands of Scotland Yard, this is probably the best digital option at the moment. Majikal tekno pop can get you busted? Good luck, Gen ole boy."
1,Beware of the yellow duckie sticker!!,"My husband became aquainted with this book at a 5 star resort hotel we stayed in recently. We both thought it was terrific. I ordered 2 hardover copies for gifts. Unfortunately, I was stunned to find a horrific sticker affixed to the front cover - a very juvenile yellow duckie sticker with text something like ""over a million copies sold"" and ""the Brits call it the loo and so should you"". I tried to remove the sticker but it left a sticky film on the cover. I have returned the books and will look elsewhere for a copy without yellow duckie on the cover. BEWARE!"
5,I've Won by the McKameys,"As a long time fan of the McKameys, I have nothing but the utmost respect for these incredibly sincere singers. This cd is a testament to their love of the Lord and the gift He has bestowed on them. ""I've Won"" is full of inspiring, Godly songs that the Lord works through to encourage, comfort and guide. The McKamey's songs are of the highest quality. Not only are they tools for God to use, but ""I've Won"", ""He Calms Me"" and ""The Other Side"" have all peaked the southern gospel charts. This group is truly a breath of fresh air; sincere, humble, and Godly while amazingly talented and genuinely enthusiastic about serving our Lord. ""I've Won"" is a must have and the McKameys are people I strongly applaud in character and ministry."
3,Good if you live in Europe or warm climates in N. America,"This book was really meant for European growers, or those who are fortunate enough to live in a climate warm enough to grow the wonderful ""bedding"" penstemons featured in this book. I wish those of us in cold-winter climates had the variety of Penstemon hybrids to choose from that are featured here!The descriptions of the warm-climate hybrids are first-rate. However, the species are lumped together and talked about according to group rather than each being treated individually.Overall, the book is easy to read, has nice photos (mostly of the warm-climate hybrids), and can give the beginner a good introduction to the world of penstemons.I gave the book only three stars because its usefulness for me is pretty limited (I live in a cold climate) and because of its sparse treatment of the species penstemons."
4,Very good Discoveries Travel / site-seeing video presentation on the state of Georgia,"Savanah, Plains, Reed Bingham Park, Colquitt SwampGravy stage play, Fitzgerald wild chickens, HelenBavarian Village, Atlanta (w/out any crap aboutMichael King, Jr.!) and Hawksville Harness Racingand more are covered in this excellent film. Ihighly recommend it. From noted Travel and HistoryReviewer, Rich Salzer, 2011, A.D., HRL."
3,Spiral Realms - 'A Trip To G9' (Cleopatra),"'A Trip...' was the band's first of three(3)releases.For those of you who may not know,Spiral Realms was the project of Hawkwind/Third Ear Band resident violinist Simon House.Best described as part ambient,part progressive space.Pressurehed's synth player Len Del Rio gives House a helping hand on this disc.Best tracks are the title cut ""A Trip To G9"",the trippy ""Red Giant"" and the CD's twelve-minute epic ""Solar Flares"".I think I liked their 'Solar Wind' disc better(see my review).Believe that Voiceprint has reissued this title as a 2-CD with the second disc featuring remixes of the original disc's songs.Sweet!Just might appeal to some fans of Spectrum,Fuxa,Red Crayola and possibly Silver Apples."
4,I Liked It,"I've read all of the Joanna Brady novels and I've liked every one. For some reason, I like these better than the JP Beaumont novels she writes that are set in Seattle.The whole package is enjoyable. From the mystery to the family squabbles that she has to go through. You can really relate.The mystery itself was enjoyable. I never saw the ending of one part of it coming. It just wouldn't have crossed my mind."
4,Another great read,"J A Jance is becoming one of my favority mystery writers. She is reliably automatic whether the story is about J.P. Beaumont or Joanna Brady. Paradise Lost is a good story - weaving in the sheriff's domestic life, her office's politics and the crime she investigates. In the tradition of Dick Francis, Ed McBain and John D. MacDonald, I look forward to her next work."
3,"Nice Effort, but Pretty Predictable","Let's face it, when you pick up a novel by J. A. Jance you aren't taking on anything daring. This is the same, tired, run of the mill conservative writing that is always popular within our shallow society. And with a title that is totally lifted from Milton, you can guess what great work of literature this text makes blatant and clumsy references to. However, the story does have its moments, and, for what it is, it performs well. Still if you want something really literary you should check out ""Glorious Failure"" by Ben Jonjak, a novel that continues to dwell in obscurity..."
1,What the. . .?,"I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil. I got a facile tale of the Southwest. Buyers beware! This is not the Miltonian epic, but rather a wolf in sheep's clothing."
1,Was Paradise Lost or the author,Terrible book. Sub plots on a road to nowhere. What was up with the sister and the husbands ex-girlfriend? A waste of time and poorly written.
2,Repetitious,"I am listening to this book on CD and am ready to scream if i hear the words Crown Victoria one more time. ""I parked the Crown Victoria behind"" etc...What's wrong with I parked behind? We'd already been told at least 50 times that she drives a Crown Victoria. And that's only the 3rd of 9 disks.Really poor writing and insulting to the reader... We get it!! She drives a CV. Who cares? There are other things that are repeated over and over. Does this author get paid by the word?"
2,No suspense here,"This was my 1st book by this author and will most likely be the last. The characters were likeable enough but the story was just so-so. I didn't find this book suspenseful at all. And also, the last sentence on the back cover about the killer's ""bloody agenda"" targeting Brady's daughter is misleading. I thought this was a book about someone stalking or trying to kill the girl but it is not like that at all. If you must read it, pick it up at the library, don't buy it!!"
4,Joanne Brady Series,"Bought the 13th book in the series originally, not knowing it was a series. fortunately they can be read individually and you don't get lost, but loved it so much, had to buy all the rest. A very good read, kept me interested and doesn't give away the ""bad guy"" to early in the story."
3,Paradise lost ... so was I! lol,"I really wanted to like this book since so many previous readers gave it good reviews. I read about 75 - 80% of until I couldn't keep up. There were too many characters and as it was getting more exciting, I couldn't remember who was who. I gave up and started reading a new book so I will never know what happened at the end. I don't like this author's style. There's too many characters!"
3,"Not as complete a ""view"" as stated.","The author seems to try too hard to try to force the reader into an absolute Nihilistic view.It seems that the author has gone out of his way to attack buddhist/Shunyavada schools.By the tone of his writing,this author does not seem to have an open mind nor seems to be a true Midhyamika/Shunyavada scholar(although he claims to be).To put this book into perspective.....it is the same anti-Buddhist/Shunyavada rhetoric used in the past by uninformed ""outside"" sources and people.It smacks of the same old worn out Jesuit attack upon Buddhist thought by stating only haf-truths and misdirection.If you are truely interested in the Buddhist view of emptiness I recomend that you look elsewhere."
5,Wow!,"I bought a group of lenses and had no intention of keeping this one. I popped it on an old D50 to test it out and simply fell in love with the optics on this thing. I don't really have a true use for it, but I think I might have to find a way to keep it. This is the only prime lens I have ever gotten my hands on and I can see why they demand such high prices.It is rather antiquated technologically which is why I almost gave it a 4 star but the glass is what you pay for. I am actually considering selling my D60 and promoting my D50 body just so I can keep this lens. In reality I need a more capable body anyway, but investing in this kind of glass makes more sense in the long run."
5,loving this dark chocolate,i always buy plenty of these bars at my local store they are good and they taste real good.the wrapping is cool and the flavor is on point I usually get the 10 for 10 deal and it is the truth.
2,Light Chocolate,"If you like really sweet chocolate bars, this might be for you. However, it's advertised as special dark, which is false advertising. It's only 45% cocoa; real dark chocolate is 70% or more. This is a scam."
2,Why did they call it dark chocolate?,"It is too sweet, especially when you expect dark chocolate. Pretty low quality product. Do not be fooled by the name."
2,No intense chocolate taste,"These bars do not have the rich, intense chocolate taste of other dark chocolate bars -- even Trader's Joe's which is in the same price range."
2,Not quality dark chocolate,I bought this once and was very disappointed. Two stars only because I've tasted worse. If you like this then you have no idea what dark chocolate really tastes like. Try Hershey's Pure Dark Extra Dark instead.
2,Not real dark chocolate,For phony dark chocolate it's not bad if you want a dark chocolately taste with a lot of sugar.Just doesn't taste nearly as good as quality dark chocolate bars.
5,Love McLeods Daughters,This is a great series I have truley injoyed it over the years. I am sad to see this is the last. Did enjoy the last season very much.
3,Interesting game.,I played this game for a little but then I got rather frustrated with the controls. The part I am at he does not jump. Otherwise its a great game and has given me some chills. The plot is alright and as said before the controls are rather sketchy.
4,Don't let others reviews scare you away from this game!,"If you are a fan of Castlevania, get this game. Most people complain about the controls, but for one, it is on N64....most games on that system are choppy, what did you expect? and 2, just like any other new game you get, the movement and controls take time to master. You get to choose between two characters with differnt abilities and story lines. Well worth it!"
4,"Castlevania 64 (or is it Castlevania 3D? Who cares, it's awesome!)","How may I start? This game is like a misused or neglected step son... You know? The stepson who is the ugliest, and has handicaps due to having cerebal pausy... One who is abused because he is crippled. The cripple is... it's on Nintendo 64 exclusively (like Castlevania Bloodlines being Genesis exclusively, and has life counts! arrrrgh! that will be another review!) and could have been ported to PSOne! The abuse? Oh don' get me started! People look at this like it is non-cannon. If it is, the story sure feels like it! If it isn't, yeahs anyways!Put bluntly, despite the 3D faults (like controls and misguided camera angles), it feel too good to be bad... Know what I mean? If you don't, then you need to play the game... If you do, then play the game some more!"
2,NOT a cruising guide to the Great Lakes,"I have cruised the Great Lakes for years in most of the same places as Mr. Dwelle, so I was eager to read his book ""Summer Studies."" And much of the work will be of interest to Great Lake sailors, but this is NOT a cruising guide. Rather it is a rambling retrospective that suffers from a few too many political comments and rants that have nothing to do with cruising, and only serve as an insight into Mr. Dwelle's politics. He even includes a 40 page history on the treatment of the local natives by white settlers, which - however interesting - seemed to belong more in a beginning anthropology textbook than a book on cruising.If your politics lean towards the Green Party, and you have ever anchored out in the North Channel of Lake Huron, you will certainly enjoy the work. I found it self indulgent."
4,A Pleasing Healthy Food,"I just received this in the mail and I am pleased with the taste and nutritional value. I will most likely be eating these in the morning in order to start my day. The bars are a mixture of seeds, fruit, and some nuts. All Natural ingredients which is what I feel safe eating. I like them."
3,Bitchy but amusing,"WHAT did Tina Brown do to Judy Bachrach? That's really the question you keep asking yourself while reading this bitchy if amusing book. Not that Ms Brown and Mr Evans don't deserve quite a bit of the stick they get here, but it is so... unrelenting. Judy Bachrach now works for Tina Brown's successor at Vanity Fair, and she applies to Tina and Harry the gossipy techniques which made VF's success. She should have applied fuller disclosure to her motives.That being said, most details here are probably accurate. Thebook is not published in the UK for fear of libel suits. Not very sportsmanlike of Tina and Harry."
3,Just another Cleopatra comp album,"This release goes right along with the Industrial Revolution sets. A some what linear view of the ""industrial"" genre. There are some quality remixes here, but nothing to get too excited over."
2,not so great!,"This dictionary WAS good up until my child was in 1st grade. Ever since then, we are unable to find words in this dictionary!! It is a very frustrating experience for a child to actually use the book and then find this book does not have the words they need!! Only use this book for the early reader."
2,Too many missing words.,"I purchased this dictionary for my second grade daughter and I have to say I am very disappointed. She is very interested in words and looks up several words daily. At least a third of the time (if not more)she has tried to look up a word, we find this dictionary does not have entry for it. It has come to the point where she is guessing that the word will not be in the dictionary and therefore doesn't even try to look it up. Quite often I tell her that the word is most likely there and she should try, thinking the word would be an obvious one to include in a children's dictionary. But most of the time she just proves me wrong. It may be an OK choice for learning how to use a dictionary. However, I would seriously hesitate on purchasing this one if you have a child who plans on using the dictionary frequently. You will just find them frustrated."
2,Not A 'Complete' Dictionary,"I purchased this Dictionary for my daughters thinking it was a thorough complete dictionary that would meet all of their needs when searching for a word. I have recently come to learn that this book definetly falls short of a complete dictionary,..as it simply does not contain many words you would find in any other complete dictionary. Several times my children were searching for a word and gave up not being able to find it in the book, so I had to get MY dictionary so they could find the definition! Very disappointing!"
4,Satisfied,"I like the charger, but sometimes you have to fiddle with the battery to get it to sit just right before it will charge. But overall it charges the batteries and that's what counts."
2,There are better,"The readers thus far listed have high praise for Dr. Mazrui's book. I too took his class on Cultural Forces at SUNY Bing, but I came away with a far different perception about the man and his ideas. He has done some pioneering work, to be sure, and his ""lenses of perceptions"" arguments seemed on the surface to have some merit.But reading mroe of his work after having taken that class as a dopey college sophomore, I see that his views are less scholarship and more polemic. There are other writers who have done much better work, for example, Harrison and Huntington's Culture Matters. Or anything by Kaplan. This one should remain on the library shelf."
4,Question about Unique Media Twin DVD Player,"Purchased this product at Sam's Club about a year ago. Have had virtually no problems with either of the DVD Players. Except one, several of our movies will not play in either DVD Player. Has anyone come across this problem? If so, does anyone have any ideas why? Some of our Disney movies won't play, although we do not seem to have any problems with any of the Elmo movies. Any ideas, any suggestions? Thanks"
2,Stopped working after only 3 months,"I had this product for only 3 months, used it on 2 4hour long road trips to Florida and the DVD players suddenly stopped working. I tried to contact customer service, but got no response. Luckily for me I was able to return it to the store where I purchased it for a full refund. For the short time that it did work, it was great! Now I am stuck with 2 rechargeable batteries. Would anyone like to buy them??"
5,"Great for the car, warning: no battery included","This works great for my kids on long car trips. As long as you have a cigarette lighter to get power to the unit. There is no battery included, so unless you get some other way to power it, it's not very portable."
5,Hooo haa! Mexicano rifa!,"Are you kidding? Hoo! This disc is hot! Bueno, me gusta más cuando rapea en español, pero las rolas en inglés son buenas también. Y la mayoría son en español. Anyway, this is some ole wild rap stuff, kind of like a Rican Mad Lion (who, incidentally, guest raps on a hot joint called Guerreros or something). This record is no joke. My understanding is that it's his first major-label release, and he had two records before, Entre el bien y el mal and El colmo de los fugitivos, o algo por el estilo. No sé si sus otros discos son así de firmes o no, pero deben ser, yo qué sé. El caso es que en mi ciudad no los encuentras donde sea que busques. But whaddyagonnado. If anyone knows where to hook up the previous two, tell me, porque hace falta. Este rapero va en serio."
2,Too much fluff; use state manual instead,"I started out with the New York state CDL test prep book that you get free from DMV. It seemed a little stodgy with older illustrations. I ordered this book thinking it would be much clearer, better illustrations, and more up-to-date. I was wrong. This book is WAY too much fluff, full of info you don't need to know, overmentions law numbers as if that's important, and is basically a big disappointment. Please, Barron's EDIT this training manual...it's full of inconsistencies and poor writing. I have wasted ~10 precious hours trying to get through this. Now I'm back on the NY manual and, boy is it ever straight-forward. I will probably use the Barron's book for the practice tests, but I'm sorry I ordered it originally and then wasted study time trying to get through it."
2,Scansoft has a few issues,"I used scansoft and found a lot of it's features intrusive and troubling. Given the price, I was expecting a much better performance. I've gone to places like freepdf.saucylabs.com and found the freeware there actually worked much better, especially for just outputting word and quickbooks stuff into a PDF.I have other issues with Scansoft, but in a nutshell, I'd say buyer beware or ask a friend who uses it."
1,Horrible for Saving Web Pages,"One of the common uses for a pdf conversion program is to save snapshots of web pages (for archiving, etc.). However, Create 2.0 does a HORRIBLE job of converting webpages to pdf format - a lot of graphical information is lost. Just try creating a snapshot of yahoo.com - you will end up with something noticably different from what you would see in a browser. For ""website to pdf"" conversion, use one of many free online services such as at http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/pdf-o-matic.php. If Scansoft Create can't even handle web page converson, which is pretty simple, I'm not too hopeful that it will do a good job with other formats."
2,Not Very Good,"I got this light with great expectations. However, this light is terrible for reading anything. The light seems almost blue and it reflects itself off the books you read. It only illuminates a portion of one page and doesnt work at all. Save your money and buy a better light."
2,Best look elsewhere for a book light,"Sorry to say but, the bad reviews for this book light are all true. I just found one of these Book Owl lights in my desk drawer so somebody must have gave me one, at one time. The (2) CR2016 batteries were dead, but luckily (and with help from an online battery conversion chart)I had, and was able to put in, (1) CR2032 battery to replace them. But unfortunately the bad reviews are true because I quickly found out this is a poorly designed book light. It indeed DOES NOT light the full page..the upper left and right hand corners as well as the bottom of the page are not lit well or at all, no matter how I tried to angle the light neck. The light neck might also be a problem for larger books and because the top part of the light's len cover is clear, the light bulb shines in your eyes and is pretty distracting. So, yah...shop around for another book light."
2,Light shines in your eyes,"Deoending on what position you like to read in, the light shines directly in your eyes. Also, the light illuminates only a portion of each page, so you have to adjust it a lot."
2,not very bright,I guess some people might think this is bright according to other reviews but I don't. I just about went blind trying to use this. I do like the way it clips. It's just the light doesn't work very well. It seems dim to me. A regular flashlight would be better and a table lamp even better than that. I don't recommend this unless it gets redesigned with a brighter light.
1,Don't even think about buying,"It casts the light in an extremely strange pattern, one with alternating dark and bright fringes. Only about one square inch of the page is lit well enough to read. So you have to hold the light in your hand and move it across the page in order to read. This light is wrose than Hilter!!!1!!1!"
2,Cute but not especially functional,"I own a slightly different Book Owl product that looks almost identical to this one but comes without extra batteries. Compared to older book lights with 4-AA batteries and incandescent bulbs, this one looks and feels much lighter, more modern, and cooler. As noted, however, the LED burns with a blue light that is less friendly than the old-time yellowish light. More importantly, even when the batteries are at their peak, relatively little light reaches the page. Worse, because there is transparent plastic *above* the lamp, some of the light winds up directly in your eyes. Who knows what the designers were thinking! As a result, I do not recommend this book light."
3,Small,"I thought that this item would be a little larger - for the price. However, it is about 2-3 inches tall and it is extremely light weight. The lighting is not bad. I was just expecting a little larger product. The size isn't listed in the specs so I just thought that I would prepare you. I think it would be great if I wanted a small book light. It attaches well to the pages and is not that heavy so it doesn't need many pages to keep it in position. Again, I was just expecting a different kind of product."
3,"Ok, but not great","I recently bought two of these, one for me, one for my partner. Both of us are late night paperback readers, and most little lights that contain batteries are too heavy for one-handed reading, so I had great hopes for this with its lithium battery. After 10 nights of use we came to similar conclusions: the LED isn't focused by any kind of reflector so the light goes both up and down or to both sides -- not a problem in itself, but the short neck doesn't allow the reader to arch the light sufficiently to get coverage all the way down the page. Thus, the upper half of each page has good coverage, but the lower half is dim. I guess we'll have to keep looking."
4,small size but lots of light,"so small it fits in the palm of your hand, light enough to clip on to paperback books but strong enough to clip to my laptop. lots of light which really impressed me because I bought a more expensive bulky one two weeks earlier but returned it because it hardly lit up the pages. only reason not giving it 5 stars is because i'm not sure how long before it needs a battery change and because neck might be too short for some peoples' needs."
2,Poor Design,"This is a GREAT idea. Light weight and the LED is nice and bright. However the lens is so poorly designed that it leaves shadows on your page, and also disperses the light EVERYWHERE! It is more of a bother than a help, and makes me want to go back to my Mighty Bright Light that weighs a TON and takes 4 AA batteries! Good thing Borders accepts returns, cause I think they'll get another from me."
1,not so good,Found it wouldn't light the whole page of large paperback ($15 paperbacks - not the short fat ones).No shield over top of light - you fixate on the light bulb in your eyes instead of the words.Just not an easy book light to use.
4,"welcome home, warrior","I thought the book was beautifully courageous, deeply felt and brutally honest. War is life, played with great intensity and for the highest stakes. This Marine's book of poetry is touching and soulful. Can't wait to read his other works. Many thanks, brave soldier."
5,"Bold, well written (especially for a jar head)","As a three tour veteran of the Iraq, I have felt all that is written in this book. When my girlfriend asked me to read it and tell me how I felt - I could not believe we were even having the conversation. Poetry - not for me so I thought - boy was I wrong - that jarhead can cut right to the point - I am recommending to everyone in my platoon - a must read"
4,War Cries review,"War Cries is a collection of poignant poems from an author who has experienced war up front. For someone who has never experienced war but is interested in a view point form a soldier who relates his thougts and experiences in poetry,it is a must read."
1,"Oh, and while I'm at it...","Click on ""See all my reviews"" next to each reviewer's name. Notice how this is the only book they've reviewed? What a funny coincidence. Don't get duped into buying this garbage, you'll kick yourself."
5,Heartfelt and Incisive,A rare book of poetry that is both heartfelt and incisive. A profoundly moving look at war through the eyes of someone who has experienced it directly. This book will take you on to the battlefield and into the human soul.
5,Excellent poems,"This is a wonderful book of poems.This book of poems gives you a glimpse of what this fine soldier experienced during war, some the memories he lives with, and how war has changed his life forever.I highly recommend this fine book."
4,Great product for the price,"Looking into a wireless card for a second PC and wanting to implement addtional endpoint security was a little more difficult than it first would have seemed. Then I found this card, which offered WPA2. The only caveat is that Windows XP does't support WPA2 by default, you have to use the cards' utility to enabe this option. The sucky part here is that the app doesn't always login to the default wireless network at startup and you have to perform a couple of mouseclicks to get connected. The utility does have a few cool features that let you see some traffic statistics and create custom profiles to connect to multiple wifi networks with a mouseclick."
2,Must Miss,"I bought the book for my 2 year old daughter as we already have the Board Book series. I was very disappointed as I was expecting more stories, i.e., Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses. I only found animals and itmes from Bibical times. Look elsewhere for a good Bible series."
4,Space Goth-Rock,"Part two of Cleopatra's ambitious collection isn't quite as good as the first installment (Drive My Rocket) but still showcases some of Alien Sex Fiend's most enduring tracks. If you can imagine a strange hyrid of Hawkwind, the Cramps and the Cure, then you've got a pretty good idea of what ASF is all about. Not surprisingly, this CD features the group's spaced-out reversion of Hawkwind's classic single ""Silver Machine"" as well as a few classic ASF originals such as ""R.I.P."" and ""Coma."" Space Goth-Rock at its best."
4,handy but sometimes clumsy,"this is a great product if you have lots of data to store and dont have too much internal space for hard drives. you can bring this hd with you but despite the aura of ease the product supposedly identifies with, it was not detected at least twice when used with my two computers. other than the occasional let down (2 out of 60 moves), this is a great product to have."
4,Lots and lots of space,"I purchased this drive several months ago and have not encountered any major problems. I have experienced only two minor problems. The first, is that a small amount of noise can be heard when it is reading and writing. The other is that the drive has failed to appear on my desktop a few times when I start-up or re-start the computer.I am using a Power Mac G3 computer which has had the processor upgraded to a G4. I purchased the Western Digital Fire Wire PCI card at the same time as the hard drive. That being said, I had no problems with the installation or the set-up and would recommend it to anyone needing additional storage at a fair price."
4,"So,go go","The drive of course has speed, but as far as durabiltiy it seems to fall somewhat short, but if you like western digital, and you feel that the price isn't too much it's worth it, but you're proably better off looking elsewhere"
4,Good DVD,"I have trained in the martial arts for 18 years. I have the rank of 4th Dan black belt. This video is good it has many joint locks,throws and take-downs used on a knife welding opponent. Many of the attacks are front stabs. There are other angles someone can strike you. Toward the end of the video you will learn how to get out of positions that would be someone's worst nightmare. Like someone who has you on the ground standing over you with a knife to your through. The list could go on there are so many techniques. I don't see this as a end all video, but I did skip the first one in the series. I do recommend this video, and it does live up to the it's name Advanced Knife Defense."
5,Spellbinding,"YES..Even if you have absolutely no knowledge of the language...the voice...the accompany guitars...the ambience...all form a recording one can listen to on a daily, if not weekly basis. This is one performer who has lots of BEEF in her voice. Another vocalist not well known in the States is Paolo Conte. He has a large following in Europe, sings in Italian. I hate to recommend a track, they are all fun, but try Boogie Woogie, and then there is the track that has a kazoo break. Grand fun. Buy 'em."
4,No sophomore jinx,"Mariza has done it again, presenting a second compelling CD in which she shows a more jazzy side to her vocals. The traditional Fados are still the best, sung in her beautifully resonant voice. She has firmly placed herself on the international stage and I imagine will be receiving a lot of attention in the years to come.The Fado has a rich heritage. A CD that is well worth buying is Biografia do Fado which charts the origins of this unique form of music back to the early 20th century. For years, Amalia Rodrigues was the reigning queen of Fado, but after her death in the late 1990's, it seems that Mariza has now assumed the mantel. She seems to be pushing the Fado in new directions on this CD. It is a more richly orchestrated set which includes horns and additional strings. For purists, this may be a little too much sound, but for those new to Fado I think it only adds to the experience."
4,good good,"I had oportunity to go to not one but two Mariza shows in Portugal and I loved both of them!The first one was in June, the second in November (2003).This is a very good fado album. I would like to invite you to listen to ""Feira de Castro"", ""Menino do Bairro Negro"" and ""Deserto"".Enjoy it!"
3,Which other Mariza CDs should I try?,"This was my first experience of fado. I was really impressed by Mariza's voice and the expressiveness of her singing. I just didn't like this particular set of songs very much. As I have subsequently found other fado recordings really enjoyable, I assume there are other CDs by Mariza I would like more."
4,Captivating,The music is enthralling for the most part -albeit a few minor imperfections. This is a good album for lazy Sunday mornings or romantic Saturday nights.
2,Disappointing after Fado em Mim,"I found this disappointing after Mariza's debut album, Fado em Mim, which has much better material. It is also disappointing when set beside some recent albums by other fadistas like Misia, Camane, Mafalda Arnauth, etc. Of course, her remarkable voice is still there, and there's no doubt it is the nearest voice in modern fado to that of the late Amalia Rodrigues (with the possible exception of Misia, who chooses her material much much more carefully). Mariza needs a little more maturity, and perhaps better guidance in what fados to sing. If she gets it right, she will truly become the new Queen of Fado, but for the moment my money's on Misia."
1,Nothing Exciting Here,"Spahn Ranch is an early 1990s guitar based industrial act from the Los Angeles area that has a sound a bit like KMFDM or Ministry. Before purchasing this EP, I'd recommend listening to the tracks amazon sampled as well as checking out a few other Spahn Ranch albums.The only track I really liked was ""Breath and Taxes"", which has a fast and regular beat accompanied by catchy guitar riffs. I thought the second track ""Antibody"", which had a slower darkwave sound, was interesting.If physical space wasn't an issue, used copies of this album are cheap enough that the album might be worth purchasing for this track. But sadly space isn't free, and the other tracks (and album art) didn't really interest me. I rarely listen to this EP at home and I wouldn't recommend this album to anybody. You might be able to find the track ""Breath and Taxes"" elsewhere. If you are still interested in Spahn Ranch, I'd point you to their ""Coiled One"" instead."
4,Great item!,"This item is quite useful. Light and portable.Purchased this item so that we could create braille cards, notes, etc for neice who is blind so that she could read on her own rather than a sighted person needing to read everything to her. Did find it a bit confusing in the beginning and was lucky to have some help from a co-worker who had some experience using a slate. But it would be extremely helpful if some sort of user's guide was included, with instructions, needed/required supplies, tips, braille alphabet (regular & mirror image), etc for those of us who are beginners and/or sighted readers that do not know braille."
5,A must have!,This is a great resource to introduce or reinforce math concepts. Well organized and age appropiate tasks.
3,"Have had no problems, with one exception","I have had no problems such as some others seem to have had. The mouse has been reliable and, especially when traveling, very convenient. I have found that it took quite a bit of trouble to figure out how to put in the batteries, and was a bit tricky the first couple of times, but became easier after that. I have had mine for over a year now, use it all the time, and have had to change the batteries three or four times. The only other minor problem is that after about fifteen or twenty minutes, since it is so small, my arthritic hands become a bit stiff. The link given in the first review I saw was incorrect. I found the information at the following address: http://www.mic-innovations.com/files/PD910P-QIG-Back59497_43.pdf"
1,Good luck installing batteries!,"I can't say much about the mouse, since I was stuck in Step 1 of the User's Manual--battery installation. No kidding! ""Remove the battery compartment cover located on top of your mouse by pressing the release button..."" I looked at every square inch of the mouse and I can testify under oath that there is NO RELEASE BUTTON. I am probably going to have to use screwdrivers and hammers to open it."
1,Did not work. Manufacturer does not have customer support,"As soon as I have purchased it from one of the electronic stores, little did I realize that I have to take into consideration of the fact that the product may not work. So I ripped the box apart and plug the mouse into three different PC and laptops and found out the USB receiver did not work. I have gone through the live support from [...] and the person on the chat asked me to ship the whole thing back with shipping cost on my expense. I explained that the only mistake I have made was purchasing the product and I do not want to pay anything additional out of my pocket for the defective product. The person insisted on their satisfaction warranty statement. If I couldn't even get the product work, how can I even measure the level of satisfaction of the product? I asked. The person still stuck to their warranty clause and was not willing to help."
2,Right-hand button never worked.,"The subject header says it all. No amount of work with the software helped. I'm confident it was just a bad piece of hardware. I should've taken it back, but I'd thrown away the package."
3,sad not funny,"I can almost understand the 5-star reviews but I came away sad, not HEA. This is a well-written version of one type of classic Harlequin romance. There were some sweet moments, some funny moments, more heat than I needed, and it seems there were some lessons learned before the final reconciliation. However, I didn't really believe that things would change in the long term for the very career-driven heroine. Partly this was because the ending developed very quickly with little time to understand what was being promised for the future. Or maybe, in contrast to other readers, I just didn't get it. I always read reviews carefully and thought there could be another viewpoint."
5,Great macro lens,"This lens is very handy for macro shots for flowers due to its ability to zoom without changing focus. When used on tripod, the ability to zoom allows recomposition without moving the tripod is a huge plus.I'm using this lens on my Nikon DSLR and I'm very happy with the sharpness, contrast. This is a true gem to have.To see my macro pictures using this lens, try [...]"
1,Wrong Mouse!,"FYI - It does not specifically state it here, but this mouse is for the PS2. It will not work with a USB port on a PC."
2,"Batteries, Batteries, Batteries","Good range, no blind spots, but be prepared to buy batteries a few times a day. Maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but I bought the mosue a few months ago and am on my fourth set. As the batteries start to run low, it does little things that get more and more annoying."
2,it's awkward,"the mouse is awkward to the touch, getting use to the buttons is a problem also, if I try and squeeze one button I also hit another wrong button ... I've had the mouse for a week and the batteries already needed to be replaced, I was warned that they would need replacing monthly, so maybe the batteries that came with the mouse were already week ... $17.00 bucks on sale, there's a reason why ... but overall I love not having a wire"
3,DIANAS WOES,"I really liked this book but it talked more about Diana and Charles Marriage and Diana's childhood than the boys. It was good but I think that it should have talked more about the boys than their marital woes and about members of the royal family. If it didn't emphasize so much on the royal family and the maritial woes, and talked more about the boys, it would have been a better book. Certain parts of this book was similiar to Diana by Andrew Morton"
1,"Fiction, Fiction, Fiction","Why is this book in the non-fiction section? And why is it called Diana's Boys? It should be titled Diana and Charles marital woes, and a tiny bit of sensationalised tabloid stories on their sons. Don't even bother with it unless you need to use it as what NOT to believe."
2,Invasion of privacy,"This book is a waste of money. It rehashes the same old ""Diana was warm and a saint, Charles was cold and unfeeling"" that we have all read ad nauseum. Leave the Princes alone. What is the point of printing gossip that can never be verified at the expense of two boys trying to deal with their mother's death. The only people who know the truth are the boys and they aren't talking."
5,Untangles rumors and myths,"This is a dramatic story of our time, and Christopher Andersen helps make sense of it. Perhaps those who read everything ever printed about Diana may find similar accounts, but for those of us who want one good, straightforward perspective of this history and of Diana's place in it, this is an excellent read.I've read some of C. Andersen's other books about international celebrities, and find them usually to contain lots of the juicy bits we crave, but with a non-judgemental, often sympathetic, point of view."
4,Growing Up Royal,"Andersen's Diana's Boys: William and Harry and the Mother They Loved explains the lives of Prince William, Prince Harry, and their family members. It tells of the scandals that the Windsors have recently been involved with and how the young princes have dealt with these scandals. The book tells of Diana's problems: her failed marriage, her battle with bulimia, and her arguments with the Queen over how the young boys would be raised. The story seems to tell more about Charles and Diana than the boys, and at times seems to be repetitive. Overall, I enjoyed the book and its description of the lives of the young princes and how they handle their royal lives: the paparazzi, the bodyguards, and the death of their mother, the Princess of Wales."
5,Amazing!,I loved this book! I got it from the library because i adore the royal family and Diana and the book was so great! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the royal family as much as i do!!
2,Aimless and tacky,"Christopher Andersen's book is aimless in structure. He spends over 300 pages careening around anecdotes about William and Harry, but the book doesn't seem to have much point beside that. He takes quite a few potshots at Camilla, and after only a few years, some of his theories about Diana already seem dated.If you are a nut for info on Diana, the book might be worthwhile. Otherwise, it's just a messy attempt to cash in on the Diana craze."
2,Disappointing,"Most of the material in this book was in ""The Day Diana Died"". There is little new except William's supposed escapades with various females and I don't find that very interesting. He is much too young to even think of marriage and settling down. Do we need to know every twit he is dating now?Borrow this book from your library. Please don't waste your money buying it."
1,Nothing new here,"This is a sad little volume by an author who likes to exploit celebrities and tragedies. The information in the book has all been said before, so why is there a need for this book? Diana died in 1997 and here we have a book that few, if any, people should really care about.As I thumbed through the pages, I thought to myself that this book is more gossip and tale-tales than good, factual reporting!"
3,Mildly Interesting Rehash of What We Mostly Knew,"Having been an avid Diana fan since her engagement, I haven't missed a book published in the last score of years... While for people unfamiliar with the royal family, this would be fascinating, for those of us who keep up to date, it wasn't. The Queen and Camilla P.B. make their indifference to the Princess' death quite clear. Neither are to be admired for their generosity of spirit or thoughtfulness. On the other hand, our lovely Diana was a bit of a trauma/drama queen when it really wasn't necessary... She was a good mother by royal standards, and a good princess, which did not necessarily ever make her a good wife. She and he were incompatible from the get-go. The boys are the best thing to have come out of the debacle of the marriage. May she rest in peace, and Wills and Harry have the luck and smart choices to achieve the happiness that escaped her."
3,bad copy???,"a professional looking lens.outstanding quality metal construction.saved,and waited for this lens a long time.it was going to be my all around most used keeper.then heartbreak!,soft at all settings,poor image quality with a d3.very dissapointed,im so sorry i sold the old 35-70 2.8d."
3,returned without a problem,"I returned this lens but without a hitch. It made a strange sound when focusing, quality was solid just could get past the noise factor."
4,Clear and Easy to Understand,This book is clear and easy to understand. David talks about the Law of Attraction in ways that everyone can clearly understand. I love the quotes and systematic way this book is laid out.
5,"Law of Attraction - How to Attract Money, Love and Happiness","Since the new movie has become popular so has this vital topic. If you're wondering if you should read this book even if you have the others, the answer is YES! The author provides another view that is important because in spite of the message being so simple you are likely going to keep this ""secret"" in the realm of a secret due to not remembering it after reading. This particular book will help to prevent that! He aligns the law of attraction with the law of love and for me that was helpful and very much appreciated. And he reminds us that the secret is the strangest secret because we all know it and realize its importance if we want success yet we don't apply it and too often miss our goals. To be all you can be, it must be read many times in my opinion!"
5,This Helped Me With My Goals!,"Since reading this book in March a lot has changed. I made a vision board and when I would study I looked at it constantly to remind me of my goals. One of the goals for me was to finish my study course by June of this year, and I finished May 25th. I started to really focus on getting a job in my profession, and just last week I met someone in the healthcare industry like me. To make a long story short, I'm about to get a job at one of the local hospitals in my town. Now that I know how to apply the law of attraction, I will continue to apply it to my every day life. Always remain positive and surround yourself with positive people. Be careful what you speak about because you can speak it into existence. Ask for what you want and believe that it's going to happen...it will. I love this book!"
1,This book is basically quoting a lot of other books.,"This is a very small book, which the author just quotes a lot of other authors or religions. I read many books and found very little new or useful information here. I am a big fan of the LOA and practice it daily in my life. I would highly recommend any books by Esther & Jerry Hicks, their books are very detailed and contain a lot of information on how to practice LOA in your daily life."
4,Interesting Book,"I first became interested in the book after watching ""The Secret"". I wanted to understand more about the secret which is not really a secret at all and this book actually does that with good explanations. It all does make sense in applying these laws to your life. This is really a good book the begin with if you're looking to make positive changes in your life."
3,crecia,I just glanced through it & read some interesting topics so far. A friend of mine told me about this book & recommended it to me. I am lacking iron in my blood so he told me to read this book for being confident in myself (syke myself healthy).
2,Nothing special,"Not bad. Not too different from others who have written on this subject. Some really poor analogies, but overall not bad. If you are interested in this and it excites you, then buy it. Otherwise spend the money somewhere else."
5,From the heart.,"This is an easy to read, simple and yet profound book. It becomes obvious that it has been written from the heart, a loving heart. The gentleness of the writing flows with torrents of love towards the reader.Thank you,Edna"
4,Great book!,This book is a definite page turner. I read the entire book is one day. The information is neccessary an relevant. A definite must read if you are truly serious about changing your life!
4,Very Inspiring,I was very intrigued as I went through each chapter. The book had my completeattention and would recommend this to be read by anyone who may think on a more negative note.
4,Simplified,"LOA simplified, if you want to get more into it go for the secret or Ask and it is Given."
1,Snake Oil,"I read this book, which I understand is also a prime inspiration for ""The Secret"" -- just another variation on the old ""name it and claim it"" philosophy which pollutes American spirituality. When those of you who buy this stuff start working to attract better living for others, THEN I will be impressed. For now, all this is just a variation on snake oil salesmen, as far as I'm concerned.I'm glad I got this book for free, because what I paid is precisely what it's worth."
5,Must Read!!!,"Over the years, I have read countless ""new age"" books and recently watched ""The Secret."" The missing piece for me was information on how to continuously and realistically apply these lessons to my day-to-day existence. David Hooper's book is the solution. Mr. Hooper has distilled a large body of information into a practical, insightful, and inspirational guide. If you DON'T want to bring happiness into your life, go read something else. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and get this book!"
4,The Law of Attraction,"The Law of Attraction is a good book that everyone should read, especially those who are not familiar with old spiritual truths and mystical laws. In the book, most of what is said, has been said before. Still, it is put in a very simple and concise manner.If you like a fast read, packed with a lot of common sense, and a very good positive message, you should read the Law of Attraction. If you need a change in your life, then this is definately the book to read.Lydia Jay"
3,It was valid if applied.,It had some very valid points however the summary could have been better. Overall it was good self help book.
4,Good Information,"The documentary was the best that I have seen for UAV, ROV and dilemma when it comes to robotics. I have personally seen several of the viewed unmanned vehicles in combat, and I can say first hand that they come in handy. I agree that the Peace Protester annoys me, but for a documentary covering all aspects of the issues, it is neccissary. I highly reccomend this documentary for personal use, but it may be more useful for a school project."
3,Leather wheelchair gloves,Gloves are ok but the could be padded a little more and a little higher quaility.
1,Don't waste you money,"These are absolutely junk. They are made in some third world country, I think Afghan, and they just smell like a sweat shop. Seriously, don't waste your money. Enjoy :0)"
3,Good book,"Very informative and detailed book. It goes through all of the steps on how to care for a student with severe disabilities (feeding, lifting, positioning, etc.) as well as collaboration with parents, paras, students, and other teachers."
3,sped text,Seems disjointed. The writing lacks organization. I usually keep my text books butI sold this one back after my class.
3,Teaching Students with Severe Disabilities (3rd Edition),"I don't think that anyone will buy this book unless they have to. It has good up-to-date info on special education and how to do great things for these students, but I don't think many of the authors have worked in a real school in the last couple of years."
3,Review,Received book in time for class. Book was used but in great condition. Lots of information about students with severe disabilities.
1,Teaching Students with Severe Disabilities (4th Edition),i order this book over a month ago and i was suppose to recieve it before febuary 2 and i have not recieved it yet. i have called and talked to people and nothing.
5,Nice Solo Guitar,This cd contains beautiful playing of a variety of songs written by a number of composers including Pat Metheny. Highly recommended. -Steve
5,A practical guide to adjusting routines,Six strategies for taming the 'new world of work' address the problems inherent in the breakdown between barriers between work and home life. Readers who find themselves working not only harder but all the time will find Thriving In 24/7 a practical guide to adjusting routines and recognizing the hidden obstacles to success at home and at work.
5,The Catch and the Feast,"The Catch and the feast is a beautifully written exploration of the pursuit, preparation and enjoyment of fish and wild game. The photography is outstanding, the recipes excellent and the writing superb."
3,"OH MY GOTH, I THINK I LOST MY EYE LINER!!!!!","A strong album from a great goth band. Although the Prophecy isn't as good as some of Nosferatu's other albums, it's still worth it if you just feel downright cheesey. This album is more straight forward rock than their other releases, with guitars and vocals taking center stage to synth pads and atmosphereics. It's definately a pop album in the Sisters of Mercy vein, but with a vampiric twist that only a band with a guy named Vlad in it could come up with. If you are in to old fashioned 80's goth-pop and plastic fangs, this album is a good buy."
2,Beware of This Company and its Warranty!,"A little less than five years ago I bought an AsanteTalk bridge for my LaserWriter 360, and it worked flawlessly until yesterday when it failed completely. Because the company proudly and loudly boasts a LIFETIME WARRANTY on the product (for original purchasers, of course, not for refurb'd models) on its website, in its support forums, and on other vendors' sites, I thought I'd have no problem getting it replaced right away.WAS I EVER WRONG!All of a sudden the supposed LIFETIME WARRANTY has become a FIVE YEAR WARRANTY . . . and calculated from the date of manufacture, not from the date of purchase! Something is very wrong here, folks, and based on the treatment I've received over the past 24 hours, I would strongly recommend avoiding this company."
3,Accurate to detail considering the scope of subject matter,"The majority of the information was culled from Coast Guard records, interviews and recollections from officer grades. There was very little input from the enlisted ranks. As an former enlisted man and veteran of the Tan My loran station, I enjoyed the book but it was a bit general in the coverage."
5,A great study book,I got this book along with a person who has been a teacher to me for many years. We went through it chapter by chapter and had some great question and answer sessions and I really learned a lot. Thanks for a great book.
5,Certain to open the eyes of every firearm owner in the U.S.!,"The author has done an outstanding job illustrating the twisted logic used by gun-control extremists in their campaign for domestic disarmament.Davidson is quite successful in revealing the fact that ""gun control"" is not about crime and public safety, but about punishing those who hold political beliefs contrary to those of the cultural elite."
1,Complete Nonsence and Junk Science,If I had (or was forced) to read only one anti-gun book this year I would read this one because it shows how biased some can be and the nonsensical arguments that are used.
4,Decent cables,"These cables work as good as any others, but I would spend the extra money and get the ones with the clip that holds the cable to the connector, so it won't come loose."
4,Wrong Image,"Good kit when Amazon has it on sale, however,,,, Was very disapointed when it arrived due to the fact that I thought it was the kit with the battery terminals. AS SEEN IN THE PICTURE. Picture is not the same kit."
2,Unidiomatic singing,"Eaglen's performances of Mozart and Strauss are generally disappointing, for her singing doesn't have the simplicity for Mozart and the lustrous quality for the Strauss. It's far too over-generalised and the result is insipid."
1,Weakness exposing attempt,"I'm afraid Jane Eaglen doesn't quite know of her own capabilities and limitations. Opera singing is not just a matter of beautiful sound. There has to be emotion, drama and charisma, none of these Eaglen has. Her Mozart is at least competent, though far from outstanding. But her Strauss definitely doesn't work! Just pull down any (yes, any) recording of Strauss by any (yes, any) soprano and you'll at once note how deficient Eaglen's interpretations are. No, she definitely is not for such repertoire. Besides, her top register isn't glorious at all - a liability in Strauss. This is just an ill-considered attempt which exposes her weakness as an artist."
2,Not so good,The knife looks cool but is not practical. The balance is off however my biggest complaint is that the handle feel off as the fastening design is ineffective over the long term.
2,Just for show,"Its a cool looking knife, but horribly weighted and the handle would be uncomfortable at best to actually wield the thing. If you like how it looks and are gonna hang it on the wall, then by all means buy it, but seriously you can get way better at a flea market :P"
2,Cheap. In price and quality.,"You get what you pay for here. Crappy steel, low quality ""wood"" handle, and messy fit and finish. I took this outside and chopped at some low limbs on some trees that needed trimming, and I hit the bark hard a couple times. The blade bent sideways a couple degrees and the handle got knocked loose. Very disappointing. The best thing about this knife is the way it LOOKS out of the box. Even there though, by the handle there was a mess. Made in Pakistan... I wish I would have gotten something American Made. Oh well I'll leave it in my truck in case I ever need to go kill a wild boar... (The point is sharp, not the edge)"
2,"Okay, at best.","This knife is not as good as it claims to be. The handle is a cheap lightweight wood (possibly balsa wood or something), the blade was not sharp (and at parts, the blade looked as though it was broken, giving it a ruff blade edge), and the blade is not secured well into the handle (i was able to visibly move it slightly with just my hand). the only possitive thing that i have to say about this knife is that there is a nice heavy weight to the blade (though i wouldn't be suprised if it wasnt the stainless steel it claims to be) and it could probably cause some damage. I guess you definitely get what you are paying for here, a cheap price for a cheap knife."
1,Total Lemon!,This is a [useless] knife. I could barely get more than 2 inches of penatration with it.(...)
4,very nice,very nice and large bowie knife. just beware of a company called King of Swords trying to sell this knife. they will try to keep your money and never send you the knife!
5,Good Product at a Reasonable Price,The light bulbs were exactly as advertised and well made particularly compared to some others I have bought with wires for pins. These lights are well designed.
5,Brilliant Optics,"I have read the vast reviews left about this beast which say many of the things I also find true. To make this short and concise, this is the best lens I have ever used optically, build quality and of course the DC. This lens is pinpoint sharper than my 16-35 F4, blows my 50mm 1.4G away while providing killer depth of field. Buy it now before it is discontinued and skyrockets to $3,000 used. Cheers..."
5,A true classic lens,"I have been looking at this lens for a while This is an old style built lens, and the usage reminds why Nikon developed a strong following.How old, well the manual references the FA, F3, and F4 as compatible cameras,, the digital world was far far awayThe strength is the sharpness of the lens. I have it coupled with a D800, and the lens is capable to resolve to the finest detail. The balance of the lens with larger body SLRs like a 300/700/800 etc, is just about perfect. not too large and weight just right.The Deselective control is super easy, simply decide your aperature, match the control ring to the same setting, set your exposure, focus, and you are all set. I am still need more time to really build up pictures that I prefer the effect.On the whole, I recommend this lens for anyone that is looking for old school build, for a lens that will have most likely an permanant place in your kit, I wonder how much longer Nikon will keep making this classic piece of glass."
2,OK but nothing great,"I was expecting more real advice from a book titled ""College 101"". The book is funny but it doesn't give any information to a student just starting out in college. All it does is ""expose"" the dark sides of college, like we don't already know it's a racket. For good or bad though, most people need a college degree to get the job/lifestyle they want so they've got to pay the piper eventually. If he could tell me how to gain admission into and graduate from Harvard for under $40,000 then that would be something!The funniest thing about this book however is that the author has become that which he seems to hate most. He is someone making a huge amount of money selling books to college students!"
4,College Kids,I purchased this book actually for my grandchild who was starting there first year of college. I read it myself first then gave it to him as a gift .The book has a lot of humor and tells of experiences that others have had during there college life. My grandchild was quite nervous starting out in college so I though this book might lighten the mood for him and that it gave advice of what to bring for dorm rooms and so on. I thought it was a great book for anyone starting out with there first year of college or later on. Very Well Done!!!
5,Great mic for small groups,"Really enjoy this mic - good quality sound from it. Sometimes the battery must be re-seated, but a great value in all."
4,Good for what it is,"As another reviewer said, I too have a more high end (more expensive) mic than this. But this is the one I use most because it just works. Just plug it into the sound card on the computer and pod cast, or sing away. Still weak on volume, but use ""normalize"" and it becomes hot. Worth the money, not made for professional studio use, but great for the home studio and hobbyist."
2,Limited,"This is a very limited type of calendar creator -- there is not much scope for individual imports of data. I was hoping for more, but this is nice enough for the price if you are not looking for an opportunity for much self-expression in your calendar creations."
2,Classic Canuck pop rockers deserve better than this,"Trooper was one of Canada's best 1970s pop rock bands. Influenced by Guess Who/BTO founder Randy Bachman (he produced the Vancouver quintet's first four albums), Trooper had a dozen top 20 hits north of the border between 1975 and '80. The band is still together, with lead vocalist Ra McGuire and guitarist Brian Smith touring around the country.The question is, why has MCA (the label that released 7 of Trooper's 9 studio albums) not given the band its due with a decent compilation? Hot Shots was released right after the fourth album, so it's missing a huge part of the the group's history. Not only that, Hot Shots contains only 12 songs and 45 minutes -- far less than an average CD can hold. Finally, this cd has *terrible* sound quality, as if it was mastered from a beat-up 8-track tape.Shame on MCA for spitting on Trooper's catalogue! Then again, I shouldn't be surprised. The label still hasn't released all the studio albums on CD."
1,Really Bad Sound Quality,"I bought this expensive CD for the same reason you are looking at it, to get Raise a Little Hell on CD. Let me tell you straight up that this CD sounds really, really bad. I read the previous review regarding the sound quality and asked myself, ""How bad can it really be?"" Its so bad, I threw it away. Now that's bad. I don't know if any of the other CDs are any better, but don't buy this one, you will be throwing 20 bills out the window."
5,good cd,great trooper cd i know the lead singers son connor he is a cool guy and i met the lead singer for trooper they live in vancouver bc
4,Almost an ideal Trooper compilation,"This would be the perfect Trooper compilation, except for one glaring omission: ""3 Dressed Up as a 9"" was one of Trooper's best tunes, yet it was, for inexplicable reasons, not included. But all the rest are here: ""The Boys in the Bright White Sports Car,"" ""General Hand Grenade,"" and ""Raise a Little Hell"" being the most outstanding cuts. ""Raise a Little Hell"" ranks below Alice Cooper's ""School's Out"" but rivals Prism's ""Young and Restless"" and Twisted Sister's ""We're Not gonna Take Take It"" as a teen rock anthem."
2,Good history of WiFi,Glad I didn't pay very much for this book. It's a good history of WiFi and was probably very good information back in 2002-2003 but it's out of date in today's WiFi world. It only mentions 802.11g protocols and doesn't touch on the new 802.11n protocol. Instead it concentrates on the 802.11a and 11b protocols which are being phased out for the faster and longer range 11g and 11n protocols. My recommendation is to save your money and look for a more up-to-date book on WiFi networking. There have been many advances with home networks and the WiFi equipment used to set them up. This book is obsolete.
3,3 out of 5,"I wanted to like this lens badly based on what I needed in my bag and what was said here and at other sites. Unfortunately I found the lens to be unacceptably soft between f/2.8 and 4.5. If I would have been a little more careful in my research I would have noticed this to be a common observation though for landscape photographers they don't mind as they're typically stopped down anyway. But for me, to consider the 17-35mm as a replacement for the kit 18-70 as a near-full time lens I just couldn't justify the price/quality ratio when I'd have to stop the lens down to where the kit lens is to get to the sweet spot. I guess I'll have to start looking for the 17-55mm option where it is said to excel at the wider open aperature."
5,great!,"an ultra high quality lens far superior than the canon counterpart, i actually have the canon 16-35L 2.8 II and bought this lens for my friend who has a nikon d700, i am totally impressed by nikon and especially there 5 year warranty on most of their lenses. if i did not already own canon lenses i would have defiantly switched."
4,Lens is amazing!!!,Works perfect but be aware about some resellers who give E+ or 4.5saters for an used items and the rates are overated!
2,I received a Dud!!,"Check the quality control of this lens when you buy. Mine had severe front focus problems. Even when i selected the auto focus sensor the lens still had focusing issues . The lens was soft to F4. At F2.8 the images were incredibly poor. In my 20+ years of photography i have never seen a lens this bad. To make sure, i borrowed a friends 18-55VR. This $200.00 lens had better color saturation, contrast and accurate auto focus. Not only that, but it was sharper. To get the 17-35 as sharp, i had to stop down to F8. I tried to get another sample but they were out of stock, so i just returned it. I know a lot of people rate this lens 5 stars, and i understand that ever now and then you get a bad sample, but this lens had multiple problems. On the positive side, it is not as big and heavy as some people claim. It balances well on my D200, and the autofocus is fast. I will be looking into the 24-70 2.8."
3,US Robotics Broadband Router 8004 - Router,well the router works well but i have a frequent dissconects from my internet not sure why so if your looking for a cheap router its good for the basic stuff but i would look else where for a better one. in all it works good when its connected but having to reset it often is a hassel.also it is good for gaming as stated by the website i have my ps3 hooked up to it and it works fine.
5,HIS DANCE BAND YEARS JUST KEPT GOING,"I have several of the Pulse series ""The Dance Band Years"" which, although basic, represent excellent value for money. The generic title is a bit of a misnomer in this case though, given that the earliest track on this reissue dates from July 1939, by which time the dance band years were pretty well over. Joe Loss was one of the few who proved the exception, because he continued to lead his band until early 1990, in which year he died at the age of 80. He owed his success to the ability to adapt to the wide range of music within the dance band idiom.This compilation presents a judicious selection of Joe's cover versions of other bands' hits (including Glenn Miller's ""In The Mood"", Teddy Powell's ""In Pinetop's Footsteps"", and Charlie Barnet's ""Skyliner""), and romantic ballads, some of which feature Chick Henderson, whose career was sadly cut short soon after. Sound quality is excellent, and shows off what was a first-rate swinging band."
3,A Romantic Masterpiece,"Vivid is a very well written love story about two very head-strong people. One, a young female doctor, years ahead of her time and the other, a seasoned town mayor with a tortured past. Vivid comes to town and sets his world on it's ear and breaks down some sexist barriers in Grayson's Grove. It's very easy to fall in love with Nate, Vivid, and Nate's adopted daughter, Magic. It is a story of true love that is filled with little-known historical truths about African American and Native American cultures. I know anyone who picks up this book will not be able to put it down!"
3,Beware of this possible failure mode.,"I've used the 5360 at my home for about 6 years. It has shown to be susceptible to dropping the Internet connection when someone else in the house picks up the phone to make a call. This weekend was it's last gasp, apparently, as I was unable to connect to my DSL service provider and the field tech says the unit is showing the symptoms of an internal failure, namely, that the lights are sequencing themselves off and on, indicating that it's trying to re-boot itself repeatedly.Yes, when no one else was trying to use the phone, and my DSL company was working, it worked as expected... but I'd really would have liked to have had a more robust and reliable unit."
2,It didn't work.,"Just putting it out there: I am very computer and network savvy, so I have confidence that there wasn't user-error involved.The product came in on time, all the lights flickered, but the ethernet port didn't work.I did not investigate further because whatever."
1,Only worked for an hour!,"This device was a pain to connect, and has no user interface. After struggling to connect, using 3 different computers and 2 different phone jacks in my apartment, I was finally able to connect online. But that only lasted 1 hour, then it never came back. I spent hours on the phone with the DSL provider, and they swear the line outside was good, but I still can't get online with this modem. Very bad purchase, stay away."
2,Buggy,"It is easy to set up and when it works, the connection is excellent, but a couple of times per day it has to be rebooted."
3,A Great Lesson,"I am a student of darts.I shot with these for the first time and shot perfect rounds.However, they required too much adjustment to be accurate.The adjustment taught me a lot about my game.I have gone back to shooting with thinner darts again.I have never shot better. I owe it to ny Hornet experience."
2,Not good,"When I was starting with oils I was not sure whether I was going to enjoy the whole process. And so I decided to buy a less expensive book.This book does not give any detailed information on mediums,brushes,techniques etc which are crucial for a complete beginner.I started with the first project and I noted that the project was not explained completely. There were parts of landscape not covered in the explanation and it was very frustrating. I had to essentially improvise my own brush strokes and colors to get on with it.If you are serious about oil painting spend some more money and try to get a book that covers all the aspects. This book is not worth it."
1,Not the best,"I read parts of this book for a graduate course side by side with David Cannadine's ""Ornamentalism."" There's no comparison--Cannadine's book is superb and deeply engaged with the history. Wilson's is MUCH more sensationalist and much less historical."
4,This really is a good series,"The books in this series thus far are excellent. The structure is good, the endings come together nicely, the dialogue doesn't get boring, and the plot is interesting and imaginative. The pace is good, and I didn't get sick of the characters, there aren't too many characters. That's more than I can say for the Wheel of Time. This series deserves a broader popularity."
1,Pedantic and silly,"Gods knows there is enough standard fantasy fare out there these days. Queen of Demons was a second rate book, with superficial characters and a plot that kept moving because when it stood still it fell apart. The first book had promise, so I decided to give the third a try. I should have saved my money. This is just the same rehash of every other Sword and Sorcery plot, only not as well done, without any depth or colors of real characterization. [How seriously can you take a villian called ""Great One"", anyway?] My advice to David Drake is to try something else. There are already too many far more talented writers in the epic fantasy field."
2,What happened??,"After the first two books, this reader expected the characters and the plot to develop. Unfortunately, Servant of the Dragon reads like a shopping trip to the fantasy stacks at the local bookstore! Drake established some really promising characters and world building in his first two books in the series, then in this installment, the reader is forced into all sorts of confusing battles where the main characters are seperated are tossed about from world to world facing unrelated situations. I really enjoyed his first two books but Servant is almost unreadable."
2,a disapoitment.........,"I was a big fan of the first two books, and I couldn't wait for this on to come out. I was let down. The story line was just repetitive to the first two books, and after awhile that just gets boring. There was just no real strong plot to this book. I was definetly disapointed. I hope the next one is better."
2,Fell short of the first 2,"The first of this series, Lord of the Isles, had a great start with the development of the characters. The second one, Queen of Demons, gave each of the characters and the reader, a great adventure. What happened with Servant of the Dragon? No new story line and a complete rehash of Queen of the Demons. I admit that some of the characters were imaginative and added to the story (Dalar, for instance), but overall this book was disappointing. Each of the characters went off again on their own and fought through a series of minor, but life-threatening battles, to end up together and facing the arch-enemy just like in the last book. It would've been much more enjoyable if the author developed the relationships between the original characters a little more and provided more cooperation between the Barca's Hamlet people before and during the final conflict."
4,"Better Than ""Queen of Demons""","The third book in the series, ""Servant of the Dragon"" is better than the previous ""Queen of Demons."" I especially liked the ring-demon Krias, and his journey with Cashel. There were numerous spiritual and social underpinnings to many things that Krias said; the statements he made had great applications to having a meaningful life. Although ""Lord of the Isles"" pales in comparison to ""The Wheel of Time"" it is nonetheless worth reading, and I await the arrival of the next book in the series."
2,"How do you spell ""trite""?","Put bluntly, David Drake has produced a rather bland and poorly wrought piece of fantasy here. As a fan of the first book, I read with enthusiasm, but still no serious expectations. The book was full of childish sentiments (e.g., 'We *must* stop Evil and help the Good!' or 'No one wants what I want! Peace for all the Isles!'). All of the characters have become parodies of themselves. The long descriptions of trite details were difficult to read. At least make the details interesting. They are usually what adds depth to the world-building. Instead, in this case, they drew me away.In short, forget this series. I know how hard it is to leave a plot hanging, but in this case you're not missing anything - which is really too bad, since this series at first appeared like it had serious promise."
1,Get what you pay for,"I have this blade, and while it looks nice, the construction is flimsy. It is not intended for actual use. I don't believe the scabbard is anything worth looking at - it's a lightweight hard plastic, with mediocre design. The etching on the blade can sometimes be a 'little off', as if it was printed on, and the blade slipped. This is maybe 50% occurance. I wouldn't recommend this, since there are more usable blades, as well as more attractive and solidly built ones."
3,Why stop at gasoline shortages?,"An interesting movie, which unfortunately spares the viewer from any but the first consequences of peak oil. Gas shortages will be but the beginning; food shortages, the end of the aircraft and motor industries will follow. The accompanying massive unemployment will almost certainly lead to a social tensions as people look for scapegoats for the failure of the American Dream. A more honest portrayal of the consequences of peak oil is to be found in the books ""The Party's Over"" by Richard Heinberg and ""The Long Descent"", by John Michael Greer."
2,Not as good as the others...,"I stongly disliked this book. It had too much detail and not enough plot development. There was an occasiontal part that interested me, but it wasn't worth the money or the time I spent. If you like most Dragonlance books you probably wont like this one. Don't buy it."
2,Blah,"I was disappointed with this book because I was expecting it to be as good as Stormblade, which it was not. I could definitely see Dan Parkinson's Western (as in ""spaghetti"" and ""wild"") influences from the moment the story began. This lent a different feel to the book than the other Dragonlance books that I have read. Parkinson's descriptions of place were very detailed and interesting to read. The main character was hard to get into, and I found myself hoping that this would be a story that ended with the good guy's untimely demise. Oh well. Can't have everything. Read Stormblade instead."
3,Gigantor the Collection Vol.1,I agree with the previous reviewer. A strange defect also prohibits me from going straight into the episodes. Usually if I fiddle around with the skip of FF button I can eventually navigate to the shows. I give it 3 stars because the show is great but there is also some kind of techinical problem. I guess mine just wasn't as bad as the last guy's.
5,Great fun,"Lovingly assembled collection of GIGANTOR cartoons. Fun, entertaining, lightweight -- the bad guys are not terribly scary and the good guys win every time (with the help of Gigantor, of course). Crazy Japanese+American amalgam that after translation may not always make sense but is good-natured and uplifting. A boy with his giant robot?! What more could you ask for in a 1960s cartoon? BUY THIS AT ONCE WHILE IT'S STILL AVAILABLE because they're sure not making cartoons like Gigantor any more!!!"
1,WIERD DEFECT,"The one star isn't for GIGANTOR, which is awesome but for a wierd defect in the discs. None of them play on my regular dvd player. They do play fine on my multi-region player. On my regular player, I will get a message if I try to play discs with the wrong coding. I do not get that message with these discs, they just won't play. I get a company logo without any sound, then just a black screen that I can't escape from. If you want GIGANTOR, buy the earlier edition on RHINO instead of this one on E1 ENTERTAINMENT. If anyone has any info on the nature of this defect, I would be interested to hear it."
5,Great accompaniment to the book,The workbook has been a great help in leading my Bible Study. We can't seem to get enough of Liz and her books.
5,Unveiling Mary Magdalene,"The Monday morning Bible study group I lead just completed this study. We always enjoy Liz Curtis Higgs and her humorous, but serious/helpful insights on various Biblical topics. Some of the ladies in this group want to borrow the video so that their husbands can watch it too. I'd highly recommend this for any Bible Study group!"
5,pretty good,"It's alright. I love the freedom of sitting across the room from my computer and typing. The only problem is that I wish I had a bigger monitor because, my eyesight only goes so far. It's also very conveniant when multiple people need to use the computer and desk."
3,Worthwhile Only If You haven't Read the Magazine,"The back cover of The Writer's Digest Guide to Good Writing says the ``advice in this book is timeless.'' And for the most part it is and will feel familiar to anybody who has been reading the Writer's Digest magazine for even a few years because almost everything here has been repeated in the magazine in numerous ways. There was very little new advice here for me, and while a few of the essays were worthwhile I doubt I will pick this book up again for reference. I say this book is only for someone who doesn't read the magazine and wants to get a feel for what the magazine offers. For more in-depth book reviews I've done, search for goldenrulecomics on the Squidoo website."
4,Fun and Addictive,"Here's a band that has synthesized a unique pop formula, sweet, offbeat, occasionally transcendent. The best songs, such as the shimmering Sir Shaheen, mysterious Please Mr. B. and Howl A Little, have a serpentine shape; writer Ben Escher keeps leading us to bends where there's a musical surprise around the corner. The faster songs are more derivative, wearing XTC and the Talking Heads on their sleeves, but still fun and catchy. Many of these songs stayed in my head for weeks."
5,Great Customer Service,"Initially I wanted to write a bad review about this item. It took about three weeks for my poster to arrive and when it did arrive there were three little rips at the top of the poster! I was EXTREMELY upset because I paid almost $20 for it! BUT, when I called to inform them about the rips, the woman was very apologetic and seemed deeply concerned. All she asked for for me to send photo's of the rips via e-mail. After receiving the e-mail, she sent me a brand new poster (let me keep the ripped on) and it actually got to me rather quickly. About a week or so later. I would definitely order from this place again! They have AWESOME customer service! Thank you so much! (I'm doing my bathroom all Little Mermaid! I framed the poster and it's a GREAT edition to my Little Mermaid under the sea world!)"
4,"heads up, people!","If you search here on amazon for ""electric chick"" there are three of the secret agent tracks on this compilation: Slinky, Fickle Funk, and Hot news blues. Can be had new for $4.00!"
1,DO NOT USE,"Although I personally do not use this product, I am currently sitting in a lecture hall where my UCLA professor just warned us that this type of brush is extremely detrimental to the patient. The surface area of the bristles is so extensive that it causes aggressive brushing to the gum line and has been known to cause gum line recession."
2,A+ for history...F for graphics!,"I am fascinated with the history of logos and which oil company was bought out by what gas company and so on. Guide to Gasoline Logos gives just that kind of information. However, a logo book MUST be in color and this entire book, except for the cover is in black and white. How else would you be able to distinguish diferences in logo ages and eras? Some of the black and white logos are repeated from one time period to the next. There must be some color variance or shade nuance but we will never know. Also, some of the pages look as though they were Xeroxed! Because of the poor graphics, I must give a relatively low over-all rating. I would willingly pay much more for a full color book."
3,Guide to Gasoline Logos,This is a rather complete collection but I was dissappointed by the fact that all reproductions save the cover were in black and white.
3,Gasoline Ration Coupons,"I am very fond of the history of Dixie Vim Oil company. I have several of the old gas rationing coupons which show a Model T (?) connected to a railroad tank car. The logo reads ""From Tank Car to Car Tank"". Some of them are pink and some are white, all with registry numbers. I don't know when they were circulated but they appear to be similar to S&H green stamps; once a collector had some they could be traded for merchandise (it appears). Any further information on these coupons would be greatly appreciated."
5,Eddie and the Fire Engine,I think this book is the best book I ever read. I hope someday it will be published as a New York Times best seller. I hope that who ever reads this will like it as much as I did.
4,I was happy,"The disc were in great shape, the case however, was crushed when i opened it . apparently in shipping something was set on it and smashed the case to pieces. luckily both CD's were unharmed, unbelievable I know but I was able to rip both discs without error. I'm just happy the music made it through the ordeal."
5,The best book ever,"I have had one since 1988 and my daughter looked at mine and wanted one. So we ordered another one. Its the very best book to have, you can carry it in your purse which I do at all times. If your a man its small enough to go in a Jacket pocket or inside a suit pocket."
3,prefer niv,"prefer niv, gave to others, thee thou and pilgrin talk is , crazy lol. maight as weeel be chinese for some, speak truth in normal niv works well to share the word of trith jesus"
5,Easy scripture references...,Really nice to be able to find scriptures for certain things that you might be going through at the time...all right there to find easily!
5,Just What I Was Looking For,Recently a close relative had a very serious surgery and I was looking for something to bring comfort and hope. This was it. The recipient loved it. I may have to purchase a few more to have on hand for a time when hope and good uplifting reading is needed.
1,We turned a charming and helpful show into a dreadful reality bit,"Since I loved the BBC America Version of What Not to Wear (with Trinny and Susannah)I thought the American version would be just as charming, helpful, and gently chiding. Not so! Rather than the genuinely helpful and entertaining advice given by Trinny and Susannah, our American version is sniggering, condescending, and out to ""entertain"" us by embarrassing those whom it purports to help. To be sure, the English version also had the style counselors throwing up their hands in despair at the frumpy dress of their constituents, but then they put their hands down and set out to gently and firmly raise the confidence of ""ordinary"" women and men, regarding dress. Our American version simply bashes the taste and lives of the makeovers, and the hosts all seem to have developed their fashion sense from the tabloids."
2,I'm sick of hearing p funk remake p funk,"op is the 4 original members of the parliaments minus george clinton they released their second cd and really george clinton is a better concept artist and this cd proved that fuzzy, and co need his input just like they did back when they made connections and disconnections come on p funk fans who followed this band from the start like myself don't wanna hear members remake songs that have been sampled to death a million times how many times can you sample atomic dog gc himself took the dog concept too serious but at least he came with new dog concepts worse they had wannabe no name rappers from westbound probaly cause armen boladian could'nt afford snoop dogg, jay z or ludacris we want toys which is supposed to bew some unreleased material by the original parliafunkadelicment thang from the early 70's."
2,Pro-Eritrean Propaganda,"Pateman says in his intro that Eritreans almost universally like his book, and it's easy to see why. This is a highly uncritical, almost cartoonish look at the Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict, in which the Eritreans are always brave and enlightened, the Ethiopians cowardly and villainous. Eritrea is ""an oasis of peace and energy... a place of hope for all fair-minded men and women."" Why, it's practically the Switzerland of east Africa. It's particularly irritating that Pateman chides Western academics for uncritically supporting Ethiopia throughout the conflict, then describes Eritrea in the same propagandistic terms. Pateman is clearly too close to his subject to evaluate it objectively. For a more sophisticated and nuanced look at this topic, check out Robert Kaplan's ""Surrender or Starve""."
5,Great As Usual...,"This is the fifth Max and Ruby DVD we have purchased for our granddaugter and I am very pleasantly surprised there are no repeat episodes.Max and Ruby continues to be one of Kiersten's favorites to watch(Grandma likes them,too)Though the title is Summertime With Max and Ruby there is a Valentine's Day episode which is excellent.No disappointments with this DVD."
1,Horrible!,I didn't like the Fairfield Triangle at all.It was just to boring.I didn't even finish the book it was so boring.
3,wire breaks easily,"Although it served the purpose, it is a poor quality wire . I would rather pay some additional amount to get a good quality wire. In my case wire keeps breaking every time you twist the wire."
4,High quality for cheap,"I'm no install professional, but the gauge is nice and the price is right. I checked at Lowes and HD, but this was by far the best value for wiring."
5,its speaker wire not rope,"to the guy that claims he can break it by pulling on itI would ask, with what?I just used a good bit of it to install speakers in my pick up truck and its sturdy well insulated wire. I can not imagine you ""broke"" it by pulling on it with your hands perhaps your car bumper.cant beat the pricing my local how to store wanted 50 cents a foot for wire that was not as good."
1,DO NOT BUY,This cable is horrible. the only cable i have ever had that i can break by pulling it!!! Stay away.
2,IS NOT COPPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,don't what it is but is not copper speaker wire. dose the job but as i was setting up speakers wire is so soft kinda just mushed in. did get over 100 feet an it dose work but if would of read the reviews i would tried to find copper wiring because of how strong it should be!!!
1,Do not buy this PRODUCT. It is Junk.,I was stupid enough to buy this product so I could wire my new suuround sound system. I spent hours running the wire through the walls and drilling holes. When I tried to make the connections. My system would not work. The wire would snap and crack easily.The wire was JUNK. I went to Home Depot and bought some heavier gage and better wire and had to re do my project. It sucked to start over! Speaker wire is expensive so I thought I was getting a deal. In the end it cost me more time and money. Don't make the same mistake I did. Amazon remove this from your inventory. I am debating on whether or not to order something on your website again.
2,Purchased Dec 2011,"I purchased this for $5.99 and got free shipping, so I'm not complaining. The length was actually 96 feet, so 4 feet short. And the gague was probably one size smaller than advertised. My roll was one piece of wire."
3,"A QUESTION for the NEWTWON, MA reviewer!","Could the reviewer who panned this book kindly expand on his comment that the material has been covered better elsewhere? I'm looking for a good source on this topic, and if Jay's not the best, I'd like to know who is...."
5,An inspiring example for women--and men!,"Read this book and you'll learn about the life of a heroic woman, but also about the bitter struggles working people fought in the US a hundred years ago. You won't get this history on the History Channel!Pathfinder Press is dedicated to, among other things, publishing the speeches and writings of revolutionary figures like Mother Jones. So, in this book, you won't read some professor's interpretation of her, you'll read her own words. And what words she spoke! Her speeches and letters spring from the page full of passion and courage.She went to where the miners were fighting and dying and stood up to the cops and the goons who tried to intimidate her. She was braver and bolder than most (male) labor leaders of her time, and in every way a superior human being to those who claim to ""lead"" the labor unions today."
5,It was good to me...,I am somewhat new to activism. This book helped me think through a lot of the muddle in my head about how to structure my efforts. It reads well and is quite entertaining. I was inspired to action.
2,Trouble with the party,"I must say I was disappointed with this book. Perhaps I was expecting the wrong thing, but the description lead me to expect what I did. It was not helpful to me at all. I was looking for tips and ideas for civil disobedience. This didn't help a bit."
4,Zero Gravity - 'Space Does Not Care' (Cleopatra),"As long as this disc has been out,I was shocked to see that only one other person has reviewed it.As most of you probably do know,Zero Gravity is a one-man project.It's basically Len Del Rio,the keyboardist and sample programer that was on the road with Nik Turner on most of his U.S. treks through out the mid-'90's.Rio is also a member of the Anubian Lights and Pressurehed.The reason that I think so much of the 'Space Does...' CD is that Rio creates his OWN version of '90's atmospheric space rock without avoiding any of the true spirit of the way-under rated genre.The best two tracks are ""Time...In My Brain"" and ""Stonehenge Revisited"".But,rest assure,the rest of the disc is pretty decent.I still like pulling this CD out every now and again giving it a spin.No regret here."
3,Book Synopsis,"Publisher: Zebra BooksPublication Date: 8/1/1986Book Description:A PATRIOT'S HONORAs the belle of Philadelphia, spirited Sarah Ravensham had no fondness for the hateful British. But as a patriotic American, it was her duty to convey a certain document safely into the hands of Britain's prime minister - even if it meant spending weeks aboard ship in the company of the most infuriating Britisher of them all, the handsome Col. Lucien Valentine ...A WOMAN'S PASSIONThe parchment safely sewn into her petticoat, Sarah was not unduly alarmed to find that her cabin had been searched. But when she found herself in the unexpected embrace of the arrogant Colonel - and responding helplessly to his expert touch - she realized the full extent of the dangers she was facing. Not the least of which was the danger to her own impetuous heart ..."
2,"Great instrumentals, horrible singer","Loved DP when a kid and really looked forward to seeing and hearing on HD-DDVD. The sound and video are very good EXCEPT when the shrill and strained sound of the singer is present. too bad as he single handily almost ruins many songs. the only redeeming aspect is the rest of the banc which sounds great. so if you can suffer the lead singer, worth getting but with reservations."
2,ageless?,"great band but its time to call in the dogs.gilliam's voice quality is shot but the band itself still shines to a degree.i was a little disappointed in moorse leads,and i,m still wondering why he still goes in to doing other legends music in his leads."
3,Where is the access code??,I purchased this item thinking it was a great price for a new book with the access code. Now I know that I need to purchase the code because my new book does not have it....So finally the price is almost the same wherever you purchase it.
3,Hidden Dangers,"Sweet Remedy is an informative, rather than an entertaining documentary. It drives home the argument that Aspartame, a chemical food sweetner, is linked to a large number of medical disorders, some at the very serious end of the scale, such as MS and brain tumours. The presentation is polemical in character: it doesn't attempt to provide all sides of the argument, but aggressively attacks the safety of this product. Sceptics will no doubt argue that the the evidence presented is, at best, anecdotal and not powerfully persuasive. But the doco does serve an important public purpose by giving voice to the concerns of those who have suffered serious illnesses and, after eliminating Aspartame from their diet, completely recovered, even in circumstances where conventional medicine could not provide the cure. This is a relatively low budget production with an important, potentially life saving message."
1,The real Churchill you will not see here,"Go read David Irving's biography instead, meticulously researched and you can read it online free."
5,Great Plays for Students!,"Ordered these books for my third graders and they absolutely love them! We do theater week each six weeks and they love being able to create their own costumes and learn their lines, and these plays are funny and short enough for the kids to learn quickly in groups and perform. Great way to enhance their fluency and social skills!"
5,Thorough Research-Convincing Argument,"Herrick's work is a wonderful intellectual history tracking the general religious shift from what might be recognized as the Judeo-Christian tradition (what the author calls the Revealed Word tradition) to one marked by religious pluralism, pantheism, Gnosticism, and several other trends. He not only lays out the influential sources in this shift in a convincing and easy to understand manner, but he engages what he labels the New Religious Synthesis from the Revealed Word tradition.Anyone who finds the current religious milieu in the Western world interesting, or anyone who would like a serious work on the current state of affairs in our religious culture would find this a thoroughly researched and well-argued book."
3,review,"I believe that this was well written. But again, as in many other cases, it simply explores the problems. Surely authors have opinions too."
1,wrinkes video tape,"I love this movie and wanted to get it for my daughter because i own the wrinkles dolls, but the seller had said that it was in good condition and when i recieved i was very upset! It was broken at the top so i had to tape it and now it is not very clear i will never buy from this seller again!"
1,May Cause High Blood Pressure,I bought this because I didn't want to take HRT for my severe hot flashes. On my last check-up my blood pressure was unusually high; the nurse took it twice and the doctor took it once; all three readings were high. I discussed this product with my doctor and asked him what he thought about it as a natural alternative (to HRT). He looked at the ingredients on the bottle and said that two of them had been known to cause high blood pressure (mystery solved). The only ingredient he said was 'safe' was Black Cohosh. This product didn't work for me but I only took it for 3 weeks (the bottle recommends 4 to see results); just be careful and watch your blood pressure. Mine has always been normal and returned to being normal once I stopped taking the product.
5,Tried and True!,"I have used this product on and off for over a year as needed for hot flashes. I usually double up on the dosage to start - morning and night - 3x pills - and within 3-4 weeks, I am down to occasional hot flashes only in the morning. Works for me. This time I went off the pills after two months, and now, several weeks later, I am still experiencing the benefits. But I won't hesitate to go back on them if my symptoms start ratcheting up again. No negative side effects noticed.If you really want to understand what's going on in menopause and how phytonutrients help, check out the website [...] I don't necessarily recommend their products but they explain how these herbs help balance a woman's hormones, moods, weight and symptoms. Very well written."
4,Chrome - '3rd From The Sun/Into The Eyes...' (Cleopatra),"It's GREAT to have these two Chrome lp's tagged onto one CD.Specailly '3rd From...'.The seven track effort was originally released in 1981,Helios Creed is on lead guitar and Damon Edge(R.I.P.) is on lead vocals.As for Chrome,one might say they were one of the very first industrial bands to come out of the wood works.This lp truly rips!!The two heaviest tunes are the title cut ""3rd From The Sun"" and ""Armagedon"".Other worthy numbers would be ""Shadows Of A Thousand Years"" and ""Future Ghosts"".The second lp here is 'Into The Eyes Of The Zombie King' which came out in 1984.Creed wasn't on the record and it isn't AS good or as heavy.It is okay with Edge once again on lead vocals,wailing to tracks like ""Trip The Switch"" and ""Humans In The Rain"".Edge's real name was Thomas Edward Wisse,as if it makes any difference.Creed STILL to this day tours and records regularly.I know because I've seen him play twice recently."
4,3rd from the Sun is great,"True, nothing from 3rd from the sun is as mind blowing as ""I am the Jaw"" or anything like that, but I think Firebomb is a true fine song and especially for the unititiated, this album is definitely worth a listen."
4,3rd zombie from the grave,"Although it is not my personal favorite, I can say that ""3rd from the Sun"" is a key album in underground rock history. Great guitars, eerie vocals, dark synths in an album that doesn't sound dated at all. Minus Helios Creed, Damon Edge continue the Chrome journey in France with a new band in a more electronic album: ""Zombie King"". Maybe not as groundbreaking as the other album on this CD, but really good. It's cold and rigid stuff, perfect for a winter evening on cocaine. Must have."
3,Chrome lost it as time passed.,"Firebomb, what happened? Helios' beautiful singing is not on this song, thats for sure. The first seven songs are from Third From The Sun. A couple of those songs are ok, but not anything compared to the early Chrome music. And then comes Into the Eyes of the Zombie King. When this album was released, Helios was no longer in the band, so the singing is quite different. Trip the Switch is the only good song from this half of the Cd. And what happened to Damon Edge's beautiful drumming? It sure isn't on this Cd. If you're a hardcore fan, pick this one up."
2,Too Much Talk!,"I'm a huge Sandy Denny fan, but this video was difficult for me to get through. It's basically five men (including two Fairport members) talking about Denny. Interesting in theory, but often times stories are repeated, and the project feels like a bit of a cash grab at her fanbase. Very few videoclips of Sandy actually playing. Probably about 15 minutes of footage of her in the whole video.I'd highly recommend reading Clinton Heylin's ""No More Sad Refrains"" biography on Denny over watching this DVD."
2,Not enough Sandy,I was hopeing to see Sandy Denny perform but was disappointed. Only small clips. A lot of talk from people who knew her. I was hopeing for a DVD with Sandy performing.
3,"This book is rigorous, dense, and lacks answers to exercises","It is a strong, rigorous introduction to abstract algebra, but I find it too intense for most undergraduates to fully grasp without studying for extraordinary amounts of time. None of the exercises have answers provided. so it isn't very useful for self-study. It is abstract in its very quintessence: it gives no examples of applications of the theorems. If you don't have a significant background in mathematical proofs and abstract logic, choose a more accessible text. But, if you can handle the level of rigor and abstraction, the text is very rewarding."
1,opinion versus fact,"Bottom line, a book is good when it has all its answers and its is bad when it doesns't. So, we never get the benefit of the doubt and our money because we never get full answers for these books. I think that's a dirty business."
1,opinion versus fact,"I think most math books weren't made real well because of the fact that they always lack the full answer.Bottom line, a book is good when it has all its answers and its is bad when it doesns't. So, we never get the benefit of the doubt and our money."
4,Walks the line well,Many mathematics books either leave out much detail and rigor in order to convey understanding or become engrossed in excessive symbolism. This book does neither. Fully rigorous it nevertheless lets you understand the subject it describes.Having both learned from this book myself and been a TA for a course with this book I can safely say the book provides a solid introduction to group theory.
2,"If you've done any algebra at all, skip it and get Lang","Serge Lang's book is definitely a lot harder than than this book, but let me give you an example. Dummitt and Foote take like 200 pages for group theory. Lang does it in 70 pages including an intro to category theory. Dummitt and Foote is basically bloated. If you haven't taken an algebra class before, consider Artin's algebra. That book definitely has a more geometrical bent. So basically, pickArtinorLang"
4,My bad!,"Sorry, in reference to the ring controversy below, the original reviewer is correct. The authors state (correctly) that a non-empty subset is a subring iff closed under subtraction and multiplication. Then they say if the subset has identity, only addition and multiplication are required. This is _almost_ true...actually, if a subset has -1 (the additive inverse of the multiplicative identity of the larger ring), then addition and multiplication are enough. I didn't read closely enough. My apologies! In any case, in a book of this size, errors like this are bound to occur occasionally. I didn't find the number of errors in this book excessive or distracting."
4,good graduate text,"This is a good graduate text in Abstract Algeba. The authors offer many good examples to explain or to motivated discussions. Some of the more important can be buried in the text, but otherwise it is a very helpful book."
4,Goodbook for a class,It's a good book with a lot of exercises.Very good for a graduate class.Being read with Hungerford is a good combination to prepare for the qual.
2,too wordy,"This book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses. I practically wore mine out over a year-long course, and came to know it intimately. Dummit and Foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples. Of course, examples are very important. However, the explanations are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products). They frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises, and the organization is poor. Consequently, it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them. Also, the bindings on this book frequently fail. My book fell apart very quickly, and I know other students who had the same problem. I recommend Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra instead of Dummit and Foote."
2,Totally destroys the spirit of the PC version.,"What a worthless game. Fast paced, but zombies just aren't as fun to kill as realy people. You also can't dismember or splatter blood everywhere, instead, you just flat out kill them, or have them stick to the bumper of your car.(note, this review is based on the import version. Hopefully, the U.S. version will improve a bit.)"
4,Interesting,"A good listen if you are an avid fan of the Mononoke-hime soundtrack. Some tracks are extended from the OST, some you won't hear anywhere else and some are very different versions of songs you are already familiar with. A wonderful track is track 9, Dog God, Moro. Seeing as how this character never got a proper theme song in the movie, it was nice to hear it."
5,Not a bad Charger with this price ! ! !~~~,"Although this charger may take extra longer time to fully charge the battery , but with this low price, what do you expect?"
1,bad product,"On first use, I notice the charge's red light continued toshow even after 24 hours charging. Checked the batteries andmade sure it was together properly. Ran the charger againwith same results. Defective unit."
1,Bad charger,The charging time is really long. The worst thing is the charger is dad after I charged Ni-Cd battery. Don't buy it.
4,A nice little product that does the job!,"I bought this product for my power hungry digital camera which can't get enough of AA batteries. Since my digital camera only use AAs this little charger is adequate. After using it for about a month I very satisfied with it's performance and ease of use.This product is rugged(kid tested), inexpensive and very functional as it allows you to charge both NiCd and NiMH. The batteries that come with it are NiMH so they do not have the ""memory"" problems of the NiCd. The only flaw I could find is that the instructions said that the light would turn green when the batteries were fully charged. In fact the light just went out. Otherwise it is a good solid product with a great price."
1,"Looked good, price is right, too bad it didn't work","As I mentioned in my title, every thing looked good about this puppy except when I went to use it, the little red light stayedlit for > 24 hours. Don't know if it was the batteries or thecharger but bottom line it doesn't work as designed."
4,Who doesn't love the doctor?,"I have been a long time fan of Doctor Who. The writing can sometimes seem a little choppy and the dialogue a bit stagnant with the specials (especially for the Christmas episode The Snowmen; they feel rushed at times. If you are a fan of the series, you will love the specials."
4,Great piece except for a couple of people,"Okay. To the producers of the Doctor Who specials. Get rid of Paul Tompkins. He is not funny and basically ruins the whole program whenever he opens his mouth trying to be funny. Note to Paul, you ARE NOT FUNNY! You are the only one who is laughing at your little jokes. Do the world a favor and OD or something and take yourself out of the human race.Now about the episode. It basically only follows Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Rory and Alex Kingston. Those are the only companions it talks about. I thought it would have covered from Doctor WHo beginnings to now but it doesn't. Better to find this on Netflix or something. I would not buy it."
3,Give this guy an ear,"I think that with Elvis ,we or I was expecting a lot from this recording. It's contents are lacking a theme. Listen to the different segways,just listen them and think this is Elvis Costello,not Mozart,but a very bright contempory writer that for years has always tried to expand his knowledge in music. I must say the man has come a long way ,thanks Elvis."
1,......................,"........... somebody wake me when this guy's career is over...... there is a CD on the Naive label of settings of popular tunes of the day by Beethoven, which clearly shows that while you can elevate the pop song with an incredible classical melody, it don't work the other way around.It's a GREAT POP CD.This is CRAP."
2,Beware...,"If you have Adrenaline and are looking for more of the same, you may want to listen to some samples before buying this CD. Gone are the catchy melodies and rythms. Gone is the good singing. It is replaced with some horribly bland industrial music that is devoid of anything that made Rosetta Stone good in the beginning. The only good song on the album is Nothing, and it is horrible compared to any of their old stuff."
5,"mummy's home town,curse of the amulet",I loved this book! I am 11 years old and what I liked about this book was how real the characters were. I started reading this book and couldn't stop! It was such a page turner! I also liked the mystery and suspence. I think everybody should read this book!
2,Several things wrong,"1) Stiff, clicky, small, inset buttons. Nothing like a PS2/PSX pad's nice buttons.2) Badly placed throttle. The shoulder buttons (which are the clickiest of them all) are big, but if you're like me your pointer fingers tend to travel up while using the shoulder buttons. And that makes for a badly placed throttle above the right shoulder button.3) Sticks will eventually break off. I got a free replacement LWMRP, but I'm afraid to use it because I know that one will break as well. I suggested to them that they use sturdy metal sticks if they're going to insist on the skinny necks of the sticks, but they haven't modified it yet.4) Stiff D-Pad/POV pad. And it's hard to navigate with it as well since you can't feel the direction without looking down to see if you're pressing it right.5) Inset Mode and Rumble buttons hard to press in sometimes.Two great things? The handles and rumble feature. Very comfortable grips and very solid rumble features."
2,Very unimpressive controller,"Overall, I rate the Logitech Wingman Rumble Pad as a very poor controller. My largest complaint is that the buttons are stiff, with very poor feel. Also, the analog joystick doesn't seem to go naturally in the direction you are attempting to go, which is very aggravating. The controller has a nice, solid feel to it, but overall it is very disappointing to use."
2,"Wingman, what a waste of money","I bought this controller thinking it would be top of the line, but after having it for about a week, everything just started to go wrong. The first thing then went bad were the joy sticks, if you goto the game controller properties in the control pannel ou will notice that even though the joy sticks are still, the properties show them moving slightly. I accepted this imperfection but then then one of the buttons just completely died, i called logitech, which by the requires to you to pay long distance charges. I was able to get a replacement for the controller. Also from what i read in logitech press-releases while trying to get my problem fixed it seems like the wingman 2 should be out in the fall, so if you can wait it might be definitly worth your while."
1,Enter the Thumb-killer Extreme,"This control pad has tiny widdle buttons that are for tiny widdle fingers. If you have large hands, don't buy this junk, go for the cordless version. The buttons wear out fast. My buton 1 is already starting to make snapping sounds. It is for kids, not adults or teens. The unit itself is big, but the buttons are tiny. I now have carpel tunnel of the right thumb(aka stiffness and soreness) because of this stinker. I played Big Mutha Truckers and blew the horn, brakes, and gearshift toggle enough to break the buttons and my thumb. I will probably go for Belkin's controller instead now.(of course six months rest is in order 1st + a Dr. visit.)"
2,"Decent, but wouldn't recommend it","My beef with this controller is that the calibration is continuously getting out of whack on the left joystick. The company has no fix for it, and it is not game specific. This can be temporarily fixed by resetting the calibration, but it's still a pain in the rear end."
1,"Had two RumblePads, neither of them worked.","This is a problem with Logitech controllers that I've seen posted on other web sites. I'm running Windows 2000. My trouble was the same on both of the RumblePad controllers that I owned (I exchanged the first one for another one): the analog controls (dual sticks and throttle) worked fine, while the digital controls (directional pad and buttons) all registered only after being depressed for about half a second. Obviously, this is entirely unacceptable, and although I quite like my Logitech cordless mouse, I won't be buying any more of their game controllers.I'll stick with my Gravis Pad. It works."
2,Not So Flying,"I believe this is not as good as compared to the Sidewinder that Microsoft makes. It is a very clumsy controller. It may look like a dual shock playstation controller but by no means does it perform up to the standards of the playstation controller. I got it for(X)and I sold it already for (X) . I tried the Sidewinder and thought it was a better controller and as the old saying goes, "" You get what you Pay for."""
2,terrific potential with a critical flaw,This would be a great controler with all the buttons and two analog sticks. Shortly after I started using it the left analog stick wouldn't register properly when I pushed to the right. I was using it to play Need for Speed Underground. If the stick had worked right this would be a great product.
4,Works Well,"Just thought I'd point out that even though the software isn't for the Mac, it can still be used for it, I use it mostly to play tony hawk 2 and it works really well, the directional pad can be a pain sometimes, but other than that it is fine"
1,Bad quality.,"This gamepad, like other Logitech gamepads, have horrible problems. The analog stick is incredibly inaccurate and never calibrates correctly. I'm a game programmer, and I needed some game pads a while back for a game I made. I purchased 5 Logitech pads at one time. Every single one has given me hardware problems, either with the z slider breaking off, the controller losing connection when the wire is held at certain angles, the analog stick plastic piece falling off, the D pad not sending the correct directions, or the analog stick not calibrating correctly.In short, stay away from Logitech gamepads. They're of horrible quality."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Don't buy this book. It is so out of date. If you intend on passing the exam, you need more recent study materials. One of the reviewers complained about the price for Wiley, but if you remember how much textbooks cost in college, then you will think that maybe the Wiley books aren't that expensive anymore. The exam has changed considerably since this book's publication. It's like asking your grandfather how to fix a Toyota Prius. There are 4 exam parts, so wouldn't you feel better about having 4 separate books?"
1,Where is my product ?,Until this date i did not receive this prooduct?What is happening?I alredy wrote to you about this problem an d i am waiting for a solutionRegardsMario Assad
5,Adventure starts within every day,"This is a subversive book in the best sense of the word. It reminds us, again and again, that as long as we look ""out there"" for the source of meaning in our lives, we are doomed to wander and wonder. But when we accept that we get to create the adventure and meaning in our lives from the raw material of existence itself, we have a shot at constructing lives worth living. The insights and exercises in this book are obvious only when we make that great leap to the frontier that we carry with us. When so many books purport to be our guides to a better life ""out there"" this book works to remind us that our lives already have meaning, that we are ready right where we are, and that we already have everything going for us. Recommended."
3,"Not Bad, Kind of Cheesy in Places","JC Thomas mixes facts with imaginative accounts of Coltrane's life, for example, he writes about a practice session or two as if he is sitting and watching. It's really a tad corny, but you do get a lot of facts. Not enough attention to the Miles Davis Quintet years. I think you can do better. There was a time when this was the only biography available and we had to settle for this."
1,One of the worst book i've ever read,"Do not buy this book. It's one of the most poorly written book i've ever read. The author likes to use long winded sentenses to explain simple concepts and he does a piss poor job at it. In addition, this book lack quality example problems to help you learn the concepts. When there are examples, they are deeply burried in text rather than clearly shown in a designated area. Imagine an algebra or calculus book with examples explained in text rather than numbers. (.i.e two plus two equals four ... as opposed to 2+2=4) This is how bad this book is. This book is not worth the money. The only way that it's worth the price I paid is if I get a chance to throw it that the author.If anyone out there know of a well written risk management book, please let me know. I'd greatly appreciate it."
1,Borderline waste of time,"This book was assigned reading for an MBA course I took in risk management. It is horrible. As mentioned in an earlier review, the author explains the fundamental equations and ensuing examples all in words, almost as if it were meant to be an audio book. I have a PhD in one of the physical sciences and usually tear through and get a lot out of finance books. Not this one.The table of contents makes this text look wonderful. In reality, this book is sad - although every chapter is about something important, it wastes 50 pages to ramble about something that could be covered succintly in half that. The organization of relevant maths is also extremely disappointing. I suspect one of the glowing reviews was by someone who hasn't actually read it - it sounds more like publisher's marketing.I expected far more."
1,Worst textbook I have ever worked with,"I am an MBA student and my class requires the use of this book (Risk Management and Derivatives, Stulz, 2003).I completely agree with other's negative comments regarding this book. Equations are written within a paragraph rather than separated out to clarify. The text is written purely on theory - even the ""real world"" examples are relatively impossible to understand.My professor, after reviewing the assigned exercises from the book, canceled all future assignments noting that the wording of the problems and the text were so confusing that they were almost impossible to work. My professor noted that he refuses to teach this class again until the school uses a different textbook.This book has made a relatively difficult subject impossible to learn.Mike"
1,This is worst book I have ever read. awful,"I am taking this course at my MBA school ""Financial Risk Management"". got to say, this book is so ugly dry of illustration and exhibits .. u just feel terribly sick when you start reading it and honestly don't know why they have not assign some other good books available out there. please, if you want this subject for fun reading or something like that, do not approach this one."
2,Not a good book for a student,"I am an MBA student and had to purchase this book for my risk management course. I was not impressed by the book. The text is not clear, it lacks enough examples and clarifications to reinforce the concept for someone new to this field. I certainly don't recommend this book for someone new to this field"
5,Wealth of information and very detailed,"This is one of the best books I ever had. Being able to understand every detail is not easy , but the author does a great job in bringing mathematical concepts with an application perspectives"
1,Yikes,"Yikes. With a few exceptions -- Blanca and Ariellah come first to mind -- this DVD is neither truly Gothic nor is it specifically Bellydance. It is kind of a cheesy 80's rock video homage (if it's intended to be tongue in cheek I have totally missed the boat here), in an overblown Alice Cooper style rather than anything that calls to mind the Victorian romance that is supposed to underlie Goth culture. Additionally, some of the pieces I would not even put in the genre of Bellydance, they belong in the softcore porn aisle. Can we please move on from this kind of thing? Gothic bellydance has so much more potential than this."
2,"Sadly, not what I expected...","Maybe my expectations were too high for this DVD. I was so excited when it came in the mail, but very dissappointed after I watched it. With the exception of Ariellah, Asharah, and Jeniviva, it was a big let down. Quite a few of the numbers were barely classifiable as bellydance, and one number in patricular bothered me because all the 'dancer' did was roll around on the ground. I'm all about fusion in bellydance, but when there is no recongnizable bellydancing in a number, it shouldn't be on a bellydancing video. The concept of combining bellydance with gothic subculture is an ideal fit, both of which I adore, but this video was mostly a poor representation in my opinion. I wouldn't reccomend it."
3,interesting but.......,"I was really keen to get this DVD but I have to say it left me feeling a little disappointed. The quality of the production was great, ie good lighting, interesting sets, no odd angles, most of the costumes were beautiful and imaginative, the music was also different and enjoyable to listen to. I love things that are a bit off beat and edgy but this didn't grab me. Half the dancers seemed inexperienced and stilted. They didn't really dance, just did snakey arms and waved skirts/veils around. Even those who I know to be great dancers seemed ill at ease at times. And what about that bondage dance...was it really necessary? I'm no prude but well...I'll reserve judgement on that one!!"
2,icky bad,Probably one of the worst DVD's IMHO... I love Ariellah and Tempest but this DVD is NOT a good example of what great dancers they are. I thought it was overall cheesy.
2,Bellydance???!!!,I bought this DVD out of curiosity. Boy was I surprised that so much of it did not seem to be bellydance at all. Jahad's video (yes most of these were videos...not routines)was only there to push her singing career...it was just her doing lip sync and spreading her legs while a couple of chicks were making out. Let's see...any of us could do that! I thought Neon's performances were lacking but interesting enough to watch once. There were a few girls that were truly horrendous! There was one dancer that shone...I think it was Ariellah. On her first dance she did a robot type bellydance moves within the routine. It was so cool looking! To me she is what gothic bellydancing should be. She alone was worth getting the DVD.
1,Too little bellydance; not really Gothic,"Like many people have noted, Ariellah and Asharah did a phenomenal job overall. Unfortunately for them though, the other performers make it impossible to recommend this DVD. It's hard to find bellydance moves, and in some instances ANY dance moves in... whatever they are trying to do. In those rare cases that they do bellydance, it comes out rather mediocre.It's also unclear why this is claimed to be Gothic. The duets by Raven and Ya Meena may be considered to be in medieval style, if you keep in mind that not all the dances were sophisticated and romantic even at that time. Other than that, the performers could only rely on costuming and music to convey the vintage atmosphere. What's more, they don't even manage to stick to the good music and costumes, and for some bizarre reason include numbers that are nothing more than average MTV-like videos."
2,horible and almost comical,"Maybe I was expecting too much, as a huge fan of belly dance and tribal belly dance. This video was awful with only one or two high points that were eclipsed by the overall cheesey Alice Cooper look of most of the performances."
3,hhhhhmmmmm........,"Well, I have a 50/50 review of this DVD. I really liked about half of the dances and the other half left me thinking WTF?? I was really taken aback with the whole girl on girl bondage routine and the black 80's prom dress with stripper heels routine. I am a huge fan of gothic bellydance (and even perform it myself) but I felt like I had to double check and make sure the TV didn't accidently switch to HBO's Real Sex show.There are the obviously amazingly talented dancers on there and those are the more ""known/popular"" dancers and make the DVD worth watching but some of the other dancers seemed like they were studio hafla quality dancers. And some just seemed like an excuse to make a short music video and was used to fill in space. I love the idea and love the fact that gothic bellydance is becoming more mainstream, but we dont have to ""porn"" ourselves out to be considered gothic."
4,A new dimension of bellydance - mystery & intrigue,"I was interested in the DVD because I'm a bellydancer. My main style is ""Egyptian cabaret"" but I have an appreciation and interest in ALL types of bellydancing. I enjoyed this DVD. The imagery, costumes, and the dancing were, to me, interesting and different. I was feeling the whole ""welcome to our dark realm"" vibe. I would have given it five stars except for that S&M piece. Believe me, I am no prude. However, as a bellydancer, I am constantly working on educating the public that this dance is a respectful art form, appropriate as family style entertainment. Respectful bellydancers can perform their art at summer festivals and parades, not dark smokey rooms with a stage with a pole in the middle of it. Shame on whoever thought the S&M piece was a great idea! Other than that, I really, really liked it. Too bad I couldn't give it five stars."
2,More like snippits from 80's rock videos than bellydance,"Good try but this entire video is less bellydance and more like open stage at a local goth club. I expected quite a bit more. It's not an instructional video, not a bellydance video, just one dancer at a time performing very slow and uninteresting routines."
1,Most of them are NOT dancers,"I don't mind experimental dance. And even the Alice Cooper look of most of these performances is not my biggest issue with them. The real problem is the lack of professionalism. Most of the ""dancers"" seem like they had only practiced for a couple of months."
3,Interesting,I found this to be very intresting. I dont know if I will learn anything from it. But I enjoyed watching it.
2,"Lack of skills, creativity, style, and taste","Only Ariellah and Asharah are pleasant exceptions. Their performances are exquisite examples of fascinating Tribal style.In striking contrast to them, the rest of the contents of this DVD are not much different from what you can see on TV music channels every day. I don't know what kind of style they were trying to represent or create, but they ended up looking just pathetic. Jeniviva and Neon know how to bellydance, but don't always want to. Some others don't really know how to dance. And still others don't even try."
2,"Some Really Bizzare Stuff - Some Good, Though Most Not","If you've heard others in our dance community currently debating the many alternative interpretations of ""bellydance"" and want a taste of ""what all the fuss is about"" then buy this DVD. There are a few interesting perfomances by some talented dancers/artists that are worth watching. On the other hand there are some totally forgettable performances on this DVD and some with the entertainment value equivalent to driving by a bad a car wreck, a horrible sight but you can't help but look, from the totally absurd(S&M/bondage/dominatrix piece) to the down right stupid(worm-woman thing). Don't buy this expecting ATS/FatChanceBellydance style dance cause it's not on here. I'd call this stuff ""experimental"" bellydance."
3,"Very beautiful, but too safe and clean...","This video is gorgeous! The costuming, props and backdrops are dark and spooky, and very beautiful. But, the overall energy of the dancing is kind of safe and pretty. In other words, they do not do into any dark places with the emotion of the pieces, just with the fashions. Being a true dark-of-heart, I find myself not feeling very compelled by the video overall, except for costuming ideas. The ""knife fight"" duet had so much potential, but the dancers managed to have almost no expression on their faces. Yawn.I'm glad somebody finally did this. Raks Gothique deserves recognition! Still, this one is a little too much like ""Charmed"" for bellydancers."
3,dissapointed,"I was so dissapointed with this DVD.Costuming was great but the quality of dance was poor.Sure the S&M by Jehan was a shocker but she's always unusual.Her awesome skill as a bellydancer allows her to explore.Sloppy moves from others, you kept waiting for something to move you,to mesmerize you & it just didn't happen.Neon isn't a tribal dancer or into Goth?!?!What was that all about?Beautiful music,but too much use of the fast forward button!!"
5,Welcome to the Darkside of Belly Dance,"If you want something out of the norm this is it! This is one hypnotic piece! Fighting gypsies, snake women, gargoyles, Isis...if you love fantasy and magic look no further!!"
1,bummed about this DVD,"I am bummed, and honestly offended at this video. I am no prude. But the knife scene....ugh... What's next actual animal or human sacrifces??I really like Jehan, and her other 2 DVD's, The Temple of Jehan, and Sacred Bellydance, but this was too much. The Lesbian S& M scene? Porno or Bellydance.....mmmmm, gonna go with Porno. Hey if that's what you're into, it's your business, but I'm bummed this is listed under Bellydance DVD.....It is misleading. I also love Neon's stuff usually, so i was just surprised all around. yikes! Ladies, i love you all, but what were you thinking??The blood on the lip scene, eeewww, gross.I have been dancing 9 years, and I have never danced with blood on my lip.I am hoping for another Jehan video though....just not one like this!...Agree with the other reviewer, do NOT watch with your kids around!!!"
1,Gothic Bellydance lacks appeal,"This performance DVD left a lot to be desired for me. Most of the performances were poorly choreographed and displayed little actual bellydancing. They were more like odd dream sequences which consisted primarily of individuals writhing around in place. It seems that more attention was paid to the sets, props and effects than to the choreography itself. The only saving grace was that there were a couple of actual *good* performances. Dancers who were truly talented and had decent choreography. I wish they had listed which dancers did which performances so I would know which dancers to follow and which to avoid in the future."
1,No coments,"The author is very rude in the way he express about the people from Europe, He talk about irrelevant things like ""in Europe you can't find Cherry Twislers, but you can find Kit Kat, M&M;'s etc"" I think you don't need this info to ride across Europe.He critices almos every thing, the places, the way other cyclist wearing their clothes, but he still loved the trip he made ??¿¿¿The routes are good for my point of view but some comenments are out of the context.Also he repeat very often, ""you only need THIS book for your trip don't buy an other one"" ???¿¿¿¿¿"
1,Humor?,"Well the humuor is American humor, very ""dry"", and poor humor.Cycle paths are like this:When you reach the a white house, turn right;Follow the signs to XYXYXYXY; then turn left.Etc...Ridicoulous.No maps.If you want real cycling tourism in europe, ""Bikeline"" from Esterbauer collections is the answer. They are German and respect the cycle way.Regards."
3,So so,I was a little dispointed that their wasn't more detailed information about the bike routes or that there were not more interesting routes.The descriptions of the routes were pretty informative and somewhat entertaining if you like the sarcastic approach - I was surprised to find out that Tuscany is one of the most challenging places to ride in Europe.
5,Engaging & Informative,"When it comes to topics like bioengineering, a lot of people publish theses and dissertations or they rant on in a political diatribe. Bailey is the rare exception who knows what she's talking about and makes it interesting. It's a refreshing surprise to come across a writer who has not only the scholarly credentials to do the work, but has the life experiences to draw upon to bring the points home. This is like reading a good novel except the characters are real, the planet is ours and the facts are astounding. This book will keep you not only informed and educated on the subject but it will entertain you as well. Now that's the kind of book we all enjoy reading."
2,Not worth it,"The ""leather"" started coming apart within a couple months of purchase. The metal strip that clips to the belt started to rip apart from the leather about the same time and even damaged part of my belt because the sides were so sharp."
1,NOT A HAPPY CAMPER,"I purchased this printer with hopes of using it for my home and growing small business - with the intention of using it to print evelopes, overheads, ..items that require the use of the manual-hand feeder. I have to say that I was VERY disappointed!! When trying to do any of these operations, this printer has given me practically nothing but frustration. Normal printer operation is ok - in fact, the print quality is excellent - but I did have difficulties - more than I have had with any other printers, with my PCs somehow having difficulties sending jobs to this printer. I WOULD NOT recommend purchasing this printer!!!!"
2,"paper jams, paper jams, paper jams, paper jams, paper jams!!","The printing speed and print quality for this printer is great, however this printer frequently jams. I would say about one in ten sheets jam up. Might be the type of paper I'm using but the same paper does not jam in my old HP printer.What good is fast printing speeds if you have to clear the machine every two minutes?"
1,incompatibility with software,"Sadly, this printer would not work with specialized legal software that is dos based. After several hours working with the support tech at the software company and NEC support it was determined by both that this computer could not print from this software. We have been using an NEC SuperScript 660i very successfully and attempted to upgrade to the 1400 and retire the 660i. For other programs it is probably wonderful."
1,The printer comes with no parallel or USB cable,"The printer finally arrived and I found it have no cable coming with it. What further surprises me is that the user manual did not come too. The outer package came also pretty damaged, making me suspecting that it is a refurbished item.It is a bad experience,and I did not expect something like this from NEC."
1,"CAUTION: NO SUPPORT FROM NEC; NO DRIVERS, NO INK","UPDATE: I bought this a long time ago when it was a current model. Excellent. 5 stars. NOW, however, NEC has been out of this business for many years and no longer creates drivers for modern operating systems NOR do they sell ink cartridges for this model. I tried one third party ink cartridge replacement and it did not work. SO ALAS, I need to change 5 stars to one star. This is just not the right time to buy this printer unless you print only occasionally and don't plan to upgrade your operating system. Sigh. Nice product!ORIGINAL REVIEW 5 STAR: Works great, high quality output: Well, for a basic laser printer, this is a really nice piece. Quiet, reliable, very professional business-quality print. I wish it offered double sided printing and did copying, etc, but that cost a lot more in laser printer. You can get it for not a lot of money in ink-jet, and I'll probably buy that as a draft printer."
3,Need help setting up on WinME,"Great printer for the money when I had Win98. I just switched to WinME box and don't know what to do to get it to run. If anyone can help, I am in need. I went to the NEC website and downloaded the recommended Plug and Play driver, but, it doesn't install itself, WinME doesn't help. I'm sure there's something I don't know to get this running.Best place I can find to get toner cartridge is from Amazon. Lack of support is probably the weakest link. A quick basic monochrome laser this has filled the bill."
5,Great printer at great price,great printer. no doubt. The guy who's complaining that he can't print with Windows ME is just plain wrong... just download the driver form nectech.com's website. You can also buy extra toner from nectech.com for just 79 dollars.
3,Good printer - multipurpose tray is lame,"Although I've found this to be a good printer, one of the features I specifically bought it for was the drop down multi-purpose tray. I wanted to have regular paper in the main tray and be able to use specialty paper in the MPT. This printer's multi-purpose tray will only take 1 sheet at a time. How lame is that? One sheet! Apparantly, there is a 1450 model of this printer that has a standard MPT that holds 100 sheets. If you have interest in the multiple paper trays, stay away from this model."
3,"good output, high noise","I returned this printer to Amazon one day after it arrived to my house. Printer had really good output, but made a high pitch noice every time it printed and it would stay on for at least 5 minutes (the lowest time setting for power saving feature). It really bothered me to listen to it and my wife did not like it either. So I purchased Brother HL1240, liked it and kept it while returning this NEC. Output on both was the same (600 DPI), Brother was somewhat quicker to start printing, and was very quiet. I really cannot say anything bad about this printer except for the high pitch noise that is inexusable."
4,Good for the money,"I was debating on rather to buy the NEC 1400 or the 1450. I chose the 1400 for a few main reasons. The difference between the 2 isn't that great, and the 1450 is a few hundred more. The only real differences were the paper tray and the ability to expand the memory. I figure by the time you need more memory its time to get a new printer. For the money go with the 1400.P.S. When I recieved mine it didn't have the USB drivers for Windows 98, but you can download them from nectech.com."
5,First LCD,"I shopped around and almost went with another, a small 14' model, I'm glad I didn't. I only have previous CRTs to compare this with, but from this newbie, I can tell you the picture is outstanding. I do school/work things, some development I highly recommend. Cnet gives it a good review also."
2,Nice construction poor color reproduction,The monitor is ultra bright - thats good.The monitor I received had odd color reproduction.Photos of grass were WAY too green. Blue jeans were TOO BRIGHT blue - no matter how much I fiddled with it I could not get accurate color reproduction.If you want very BRIGHT color - this is the monitor for you.My prior LCD monitor was a viewsonic which had excellent color reproduction... but needed repair 3 times!I am returning this monitor and will try a Dell and NEC to see of they are any better.The search goes on.
3,"Answer to ""derek timmis"" from uk","derek, if your camcorder is digital and have a firewire connector, buy a firewire card (usually come swith the cable and siftware) and connect the camcorder with the Pc through it."
3,"OK, but NOT FOR HACKING","This seems like a nice book for beginners to TiVo. There are occasionally intersting nuggets inside, so I don't totally hate it. For my purposes, though, it was awful. Leo LaPorte is technically savvy, but this book's description is DEFINITELY MISLEADING. It will NOT teach you how to get your Series 2 DirecTivo on the web. For that you will need ""Hacking the Tivo"" and a lot of time on dealdatabase.com's forums."
3,Leo Laporte's Guide to Tivo,Great book. If you are interested in the workings of tivo this is a must have
3,Its okay but there are better books out there,Its a cute little book. I bought this the same time i bought I am a Skater about Emily Hughes. The other book is way better and my 4 year old enjoy it more. She rarely wants me to read this one to her.
1,Terrible,Terrible. Chose some random girl -why? Kids are more advanced at this age if they are interested. Nothing special. Like to see a book on a true young talent early on.
4,great independent film,"Great story line. Could have been edited better and some of the acting was amateur but loved Diana Forero in it, beautiful girl and actress."
5,Awesome! excelente!,"This book is exactly what I have been searching for! It covers everything the english speaking spanish student could want. It is detailed and gives excellent usage examples. It can be somewhat tidious on certain points. Despite this, it immediately became an indespensible part of my library. It is very thorough. I love it."
5,completely new and right on time,It came in plenty of time for my class and was completely new and wrapped in plastic. Thanks a lot!
4,A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish (Paperback),"This is an excellent, comprehensive Spanish grammar reference book but beginners and intermediates be warned. It is quite technical and wordy but it does contain all the info you would probably ever need."
5,A New Reference Grammar for Modern Spanish,Great reference for teachers teaching Spanish. It helps explain the grammatical concepts.
5,Excellent Reference,This is an excellent reference. I occasionally need to write letters and Spanish and and for me find this book is indispensable.
5,Essential for every Spanish teacher!,This book is fantastic- geared towards English speakers who have an advanced knowledge of Spanish grammar but want to know more!
3,Thorough but Complicated,"I would classify myself as an intermediate Spanish student. But this book is aimed at those at a higher level or knowledge of Spanish. But even as an intermediate student, I found this book frustrating because of its layout. I wanted to learn more about the Impersonal ""Se"" and I found myself reading from cross reference to cross reference. Frustrating.If you are interested in the fine details of Spanish (and I like grammar), then this is the book for you. But if you are still acquiring the language, may I recommend ""Manuel De Gramatica: Grammar Reference for Students"" by Eleanor Dozier and Zulma Iguina. I hope this helps others.Kevin"
4,A comprehensive reference for those learning Spanish,"An amazingly detailed book designed to answer any question you have regarding the structure of the Spanish language, be it Castillian or Latinoamerican. Each chapter has example after example devoted to the nuances of every aspect of speech or writing you could possibly encounter.My only caveat - you can't possibly ""read"" the thing. It's better utilized as a reference book. It's the place you'll go when all your slimmer volumes have you stumped.My approach is to carry around ""Buscalo"" (Clarkson, Campos) which tells me - as an intermediate learner - what I need to know in 219 cleanly-spaced pages instead of 572 densely-packed ones. I've always got this Butt/Benjamin work on the shelf as a ""just in case"" backup tool."
5,Nice format!,I like the fact that the English words are right there with the Hebrew or Greek base text. It makes study easier and more efficient.
4,Everything you could want in a watch,"I just bought my Khaki Frogman Hamilton about a month ago as a wedding present to myself. I spent months looking for a watch that had everything I wanted ie: Automatic, Sapphire crystal, swiss made, etc. This watch has all that and more! To top it all off it's made by Hamilton, a name that has stood for quality and durability for decades. The only downfall to the watch is that it is a bit chunky due to the fact that it is a mechanical auto-wind watch. Combined with the weight of the titanium it does take a few days to get used to wearing it if you are only used to a light battery operated timex. I barely notice the weight anymore and to be honest the chunky-ness of it makes it stand out a little more. I get many compliments on it and it doesn't need to be ""babied"" like a lot of expensive time pieces. I believe that the Khaki Frogman will stand up to the test of time."
4,Lo-Fi Snoop Doggie Dogg? Ya gotta get it!,"Musically, very similar to the first Rentals album. Vocally, very cute girl punk(ish) stuff. Lyrically, hillarious. Overall, wonderful when you just don't know what else to put on. This is the musical epitome of Los Angeles for those who get the joke. Though the lyrics are very funny, them music is very well written and (kind of well) performed. But the capper is ""Gin and Juice."" You don't get much funnier than that. Not to mention ""Pear Shaped Girl"" and the ever poigniant and truthful ""Punk Fries."" Buy it! Make them make another album!"
4,"light, bouncy music","I heard much of this album at Spaceland in 1996. Light, bouncy music. The girls in the band were also very nice to look at. They certainly attracted a lot of blokes in the audience.The blending of the instruments and vocals was well done and very balanced. The vocals come thru clearly.Unfortunately, the band broke up around 2001. They seemed so promising. :("
5,Jake McNiece,"is one of the genuine crazies in the 101st Airborne's family tree. I met him at the Toccoa, GA, reunion of the 506th PIR after I came back from Iraq and he was happy to sign my copy. Yes, the writing is crude, yes, Jake loves to tell a good story, but if you want a dry day by day account of the 506th's doings, sit down with Rendezvous with Destiny instead. One, Bob Sink wasn't quite as stuck-up as Dale Dye played him, and second, why do you think Jake never got promoted and spent half his time at Toccoa in the stockade? There's a reason the pic of the old stockade there at the camp is captioned ""Jake McNiece's command post"" in the county historical society literature, his antics have been a running joke in Division circles since 1943.I think it was the pics of the Mohawked, face-painted guys with the Thompsons when I was a real little kid that got me started on all this in the first place. Now I know the story behind it all, and I'm glad I met a genuine hero of an earlier time."
3,Very Impressive,"I just finshed reading the Filthy Thirteen by Richard Killblane andfound it very interesting. I actually went to church with Jake McNiece when I lived in Ponca City, Oklahoma. He was a very interesting individual. I have the highest regard for his efforts during WWII. The writing of this book isn't the best and it was difficult to follow at times since it jumped from first person to third person. Over looking the writing style I couldn't help but be impressed and appreciative of what the men in battle had to endure.I would recommend this book if for nothing else than to get an upclose view of war.I also read some previous reviews stating they doubted the validity of Jakes escapades. As I stated before I personally know Jake and his escapades mentioned in this book although seem over the top are quite true."
1,Contrived and self serving,"This presents the age old mythology of the rebel soldiers, those who refuse to accept the discipline of the unit, being the greatest combat soldiers. Of course, there is a certain anecdotal truth to this. This is shown by the very existence of the unit and the writing of the book itself that this story has a basis in truth.But it allows the author a few hundred pages to brag about how much trouble he caused dozens of officers and NCO's. These same men were American heros too, and this celebration of disrespect towards them is a but boorish. The story is related to an author but so much of it is first person accounts by the subject and he blusters and brags so much that this reader grew to dislike him. I'd have rather seen the book end with him in the stockade."
1,An Important Part of History But Disapointing....,"I was very disapointed with this book...the story line was fragmented and the style of writing, crude and amateurish. Even though the reader was warned in advance that it was told in McNiece's own words, complete with misspellings and grammatical errors, it was still read like a 6th grade essay. Too much time was spent on McNiece's near brushes with military authority, his indifference to the military structure, and his various antics (i.e. stealing a train). I'm sure he made a meaningful contribution to history but much of that impact was lost on his cavorting and highjinks. Having read Band of Brothers and the strict code of military discipline handed down by Col Robert Sink you would have to wonder how accurate McNiece's recollections were???"
3,The Filthy Thirteen,"Although the book is somewhat entertaining, the antics of the author, Jake McNiece is a disgrace to the military. He constantly refers to his lack of military discipline, his insubornination to officers, his love of fighting other American soldiers and his general military bearing. He is proud of the fact that he was never promoted and spent his entire time as a private. Although he likes you to think that he was alway an acting sergeant. All of this detracts from what otherwise could have been a very good book about combat paratroopers."
4,Death from Above,"I really enjoyed this book. Very entertaining read and some interesting info on Pathfinder actions in and around Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge.For those WWII paratrooper enthusiast, this is a worthy addition to your personal collection."
1,Bullcrap,"This guy is so full of himself, nobody in their right mind would believe his self aggrandising bull. He sure pulled one over on this author, but not on any intelligent reader. This ought to be listed as fiction or fantasy!"
1,Santana: Hymns for Peace,"I purchased this DVD and when I tried to play it, it would not load on three machines: two DVD players and one computer. I returned it and received the replacement. The exact same thing happened. I got a refund from Amazon.I wonder if all the copies fail to work."
1,I was disappointed,"I'm s big Santana fan who was expecting a bit more Santana. The track listing was initially intriguing to me; how would Carlos Santana interpret the banana boat song? He didn't. While the musicians were mostly ""on,"" the vocal performances were flat and on more than one occasion I had to skip to the ""NEXT"" track. Even drummer Dennis Chambers looked bored at times, while Carlos roamed the stage like a party host looking for a place to be useful."
1,Makit Products Inc.,"This is not a review of the seller but of the manufacturer.Makit Products Inc. - This once fine company has gone down hill fast since Robert Lignon of Houston, Texas bought the company a few years back. He fired key managers, ripped off suppliers and customers. He has run the company down as he will do almost anything for a buck. Can't recommend Makit Products Inc. There are other companies that offer this make a plate service."
4,really good punk rock,"craig's brother is a really great punk band. they have sort of a NOFX kind of sound, right down to the nasally, whiny vocals. which is fine, don't get me wrong. some of the songs sort of sound the same, but on the other hand there are some really rad tracks (""Lonely Girl"" ""Dear Charolette""). i'm not going to call it Christian punk b/c it is specifically not (the band members say so themselves), while the songs convey christian ideals and values they don't directly talk about God or salvation. pick this up if you're into Slick Shoes or Dogwood or NOFX"
5,"GREAT CD, GREAT BAND, 4.5 STARS!!!","Craig's Brother's first cd is more than I expected. It has an amazing recording quality, especially for Tooth and Nail! These guys had great potential, but sadly they broke up. This cd is a little repetitive, but it wasn't annoying, because it went perfectly with the song. That's the only thing I can find wrong with this cd. The lyrics are great, the drums are fast, and the guitars are great. Tracks 2,3,4,6,8,9,11,and12 are the best, but my all time favorite is track 8 or 4. Who cares, this is a cd that you can listen to all the way through. So I guess I'll give this cd a solid 4.5 STARS!!! I'd highly recommend this Cd. It's a hard one to find, so I also suggest buying it here. While you are shopping at amazon.com, also think about purchasing MxPx: Ten Years and Running, Side Walk Slam: Past Remains, and any Slick Shoes or Ace Troubleshooter cd. Buy this now, I promise that you won't regret it."
5,*BUY THIS CD*,"Craig's brother is the best band to ever grace the stage. the lyrics are intelligent and actually make you think. musically their just awesome. tahts all that can be said, itf you like mxpx, slick shoes, blink 182 or any other punk, give craig's brother a chance youll probably like em more!"
3,It's okay,"This cd was hard to find, but I found, and I'm not impressed. Track 4 and 9 are the only good songs, but other than that all the other songs sound exactly the same. Get their 2nd CD."
5,craigs brother,"If you don't own this cd already, you have to nuy it no matter who you are. The mix of fast technical punk rock gutiar and drums, with Ted's mindblowing melodies,(and harmonies) make up, whatis, in my opinion, the best punkrock release in the last 5 years. Totally awesome."
4,Great product,"This product gives me so much more freedom with what I can do for henna designs. I love using it, first time tonight, quite easy. Instructions included, will definitely buy this again when I run out. Never used anything like this before.Only qualm is that the design became a little light in some places, but if you use the image as a reference you're fine.I hope the fluid will last me, because I intend on using this a LOT. A listing for a transfer fluid refill would be great in the long run!"
5,worked great!,"I wasn't sure how well it would work with small animal designs, but it worked perfectly. I was able to make my buffalo, look like a bufffalo! VERY easy to use!"
3,tattoos,"I did not know we needed special pens for this product until it arrived. We had hoped to use it as a identifier for our kids while in DisneyWorld. So, we have not used the product."
4,beat with the rock times,"I first listened to the first track ""No song unheard"" after seeing it reccomended in a friend's blog site. this is a laid back cd, nice to listen to when you're just hanging. also, it's pretty cheap considering the cost of some other cd's. muy bien!"
3,Non male,"Decisamente buono questo libro sulle dalie, anche se effettivamente è -come dire- merce corrente. Nel senso che manuali come questo, specie in USA e UK, ce ne sono a dozzialiardi. Magari da un manuale si vorrebbe qualcosa di più, oltre alle notazioni storiche pur curate, ad una buona raccolta di cultivar (le dalie sono un logaritmo che tende ad infinito), una buona impaginazione e una gradevolezza dell'insieme. Ricapitolando: un buon manuale ma da non spenderci più di 20 euro, ma niente di cui innamorarsi."
4,Good stuff.,"Sonically this is a cross between How Hollow Heart and Shap. That is to say, the ambience is sort of bizarre and abrasive, but the tracks are long and there is an engrossing epic quality to the album as a whole. A good disc to pick up if you're interested in ambience that's a little more complex and inventive than your typical droney synth fare."
4,sharpening basics,"Great book on sharpening. Learned a lot about sharpening blades, design and use. Have to purchase equipment to sharpen blades."
5,If you love cheesey sword and sandals...,"I'm a huge fan of those fine line films that straddle between fun and bad. Gods of War manages to hit just the right note. Don't expect stellar acting, sets or dubbing, but for a sward and sandal romp this two-disc set fills the bill."
4,Only 38,This Set Only Has 38 Songs....Don't Know Why....Just Thought You All Should Know.The American One Has 40..Strange.Should Be Called 38 Licks...Really !
4,Very good reference book on CMOS circuit design,"This book presents a good overview of CMOS circuits from fundamentals to current design techniques. This book is perfect for a senior-level or graduate-level course as well as for the practicing engineer who wants to come up-to-date quickly with current CMOS circuit design techniques. Some areas where the book could be improved include layout issues, but this does not diminish in any way its usefulness."
1,below expectation,"the book contains good overall material , but the design part is totally confusing, the analog design is worst material i have ever studied. the chapters are in hapazard manner, the equations for the circuits appear from nowhere sometimes. this book is good for only a overall view. DO NOT USE THIS BOOK FOR ANY DESIGN REFERENCE . for analog design and CMOS fundamentals use Razavi , which is the best book ever."
4,"Overall, the best one around...","I've used Sidekick, Outlook 98, Day-Timer and older versions of Organizer. Overall, Organizer is the most intuitive and competes head-to-head on features. I have one complaint -- alarms that are set to pop up a few days before an event don't always work. The addition of an integrated Web site tab is a nice feature from which you can go to a Web site directly from Organizer. Email integration seems to be tighter than in previous versions. At $70+, the program should work flawlessly and, for the most part, does."
3,Don't take security advice from a clown,"I am only responding to ""Ronald McDonald""'s security criticism. Giving the program a 1 * rating because the program fails to prevent an inept user from doing the unforseeable is quite unfair. What's worse, even if this could be called a bug, it's not a security flaw: only backups are effective means against data loss, and this program does not proport itself to be a backup system. (PS, I'm not associated with Lotus, IBM, or the software product in any way.)"
2,Better to Find a Used Lotus Organizer '97 !,"This is a very difficult, time-consuming organizer compared to it's predecessor Lotus Organizer '97. Between the two, it appears that IBM bought out Lotus & RUINED this once great, easy system. By adding bells & whistles, it takes way too much brain damage & time to do even the smallest tasks. Too many options & too many steps. I was thrilled when I found an update of the wonderful original but, after 3 weeks, it hasn't lived up to expectations & I have returned it (thank you amazon.com!). Another serious irritation: the small instruction book they give you is not enough to figure out even the very basics & the ""help"" section in the software is grossly mis-named. I just re-loaded my old organizer until I can find another brand that doesn't make me curse the organizer gods hourly."
1,"Better Buy Bacon (Mavis), Too","Organizer lies. It will not transfer DayTimer data.What's more, the third party CSR phone number(listed in the software itself) will know not that Lotus claims their support.And what's even more, Lotus' own CSR will be unapologetic and baffled that you do not wish to re-key several hundred names to enjoy the dubious benefits of their wonderful product.So buyer be very ware. This software will likely demand that you re-type all your data. And your calls to Lotus will contact you with unsympathic imbeciles.That's because they were hired by even more callous cutthroats, whose business plan is to sell you expensive software with nary a thought of offering you help should you require it.So if you think you may ever, ever need support, stay with DayTimer. With Lotus, as with MicroSoft, hey, you're out there alone."
2,Not as good as you may expect,Cheap plastic.Poor design.Could definitely be better for the price charged.Don't buy if similar product is available in other brand.
1,Stupidity in 66 pages,"If I were to use two words to describe this book, they would be ""religious pamphlet."" This book is a waste of your money. In this book, B. Fox, writes that UFOs are a weapon of ""Satan"" and that these UFOs are trying to take over ""God's"" people. If you are a religious fanatic or a Christian fundamentalist, you will except this book without any thought. If you are a thinking person, this is nothing but stupidity in 66 pages. Look elsewhere for a decent UFO book, such as William Bramley's ""The Gods of Eden."""
1,Unadulterated Rubbish,"This is one of the most ridiculous books I have ever come across. It is academically inaccurate beyond belief, badly researched, and serves only two purposes: to provide a safe haven for insecure religious fanatics (in this case, Christians), and to keep Fox's bank account well and truly topped up with the money provided by the gullible people who buy this book.One example of Fox's intentionally misleading inaccuracies is her use of the word 'Satan'. She claims that Satan was the name of the so-called biblical fallen angel. In reality, however, it derives from the Hebrew word 'sAtAn' and simply means 'adversary'. It is not the name of any particular person or entity.I rest my case!"
3,He's got high hopes!,"Any author can tell you times they've struggled with their writing. Poor Shakespeare has the words, the struggle comes in the effort it takes the tiny insect to manipulate a fountain pen and get the actual letters down on paper. Not to fear though, for he is rewarded when the children come to know and love his stories. And when Shakespeare becomes too old to physically handle the writing process - he then becomes a teller of tales. Kids in grades Kdg through 4 should enjoy this spunky little guy!"
3,Too much of a so-so thing,"H. L. Mencken is justly reknowned as one of the great American curmudgeons. For an autodidact he is astonishingly well versed in a dizzying variety of both common and arcane disciplines. And his biting comments are usually germane and hilarious. But after a few pages, the spirit flags. This sort of strong stuff is best taken in small drafts. If you get these collections plan on reading snippets at a time."
2,"Lots of pink, but poor message for kids","My daughter loves pink so I thought this would be a nice book for her. Well, she loves the book but I cringe each time I read it as it basically encourages kids to whine and their parents will give in."
5,What a wonderful book!,"This book is a total delight! From its very pink cover to its shockingly pink pages, it is clear that this is a book for serious lovers of pink. My 5 year old daughter loves it, and will not let it out of her sight. The engaging story is well written, and you will enjoy it as much as your daughter does. This is quite fortunate because if your daughter loves pink (and what little girl does not?) you can expect to be reading this story together night after night after night."
1,Nothing Good Can Come of this Book,"I don't want to repeat other reviewers here who agree this book is not worthwhile because they've already summed up the important (negative) points about this book.The book might as well just be a list of things the girl asks for and then gets, no questions asked.I hid this book from my kids after we read it once."
4,The ideal cure for Pinkitis!,"If you've got a child in your life obsessed with pink, this book offers the ideal cure. Madison is in love with pink everything, from her favorite dress to the walls and ceiling of her room to every stuffed animal in it. Vive le pink!But one day, after painting her entire world pink, she discovers the drawbacks of her mono-colored existence. Could there be such a thing as too much pink? Yes, she discovers.About a week after reading this book to my similarly obsessed four-year-old, she explained to me that ""I love purple and blue and orange. I'm not like Madison."" Job done. Enough said."
3,"Cute, but not my favorite ""pink"" book","The story is cute, but I'm not as big a fan of the illustrations. It's a nice addition to our book collection, but we do like Pinkalicious better."
1,Not good writing,"I'm a children's picture book writer and I have to say that this book was not well written. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the writing was immature and I felt like it didn't flow well either. I suppose the message here is that if you write a book with ""pink"" in the title, you can just about sell anything to little girls who love pink. I'm thinking of my next title right now..."
4,Math Class K-8,"My son really enjoyed this keyboard. We are still learning about the different functions of it, especially the part where it is suppose to help beginners learn to play the keyboard. This fuctions moves kind of fast for those who are completely illiterate about the keyboard. Overall, I give this product a 4 because of the different functions it is able to do."
4,Good deal.,"Ran into a mashup of Sunglasses and Blue Monday (Blue Sunglasses by Tiga & Zytherius) through Pandora, and couldn't find it anywhere else. The CD was $5. I would have been happy with that price for just the one song, since I liked it so much, but it turns out there's a lot of good electronica to be discovered on this album. I haven't listend to the whole album yet, but Daniel Diamond: Champu, The Riot Society: Understand Me, Dr. Kucho: La Luna, and FC Kahuna: Hayling are the other ones I've randomly run into that I'd give a 4 out 5 rating or higher. There's a number of them with a Daft Punk/House feel to them which I happen to like.2 disks of random good electronica for $5 is a pretty good deal in my estimation."
1,Not compatable,"Be careful when ordering thesses types of items. The product is sold to replace camcorder batteries. I ordered it, even though it said it was good for my camcorder, it did not fit. Speak with customer service before purchasing this type of an item. Save time."
3,over rated but has its good points,"I am a 43 year old rocker. The legend of Black Sabbath is larger then the reality. Nobody really liked them in the 70s. I saw them open up for Blondie!I have been a critic on Black Sabbath for a long time. I would go out of my way to rip them.Lately, I heard War Pigs on the radio. It sounded pretty damn good. Then at a Flaming Lips concert, they did a cover of War Pigs and it was awesome. Maybe I was wrong?!I now apologize for being too judgemental. In the right place and time, music off of this album can rock the house down"
3,worthwhile,"this music is a little weird.but it's cool in some kind of errie way.ozzie ozbourne did a great job but this is not my cup of tea.stick to ""ozzie"" though my fellow metal fans because he is the king of metal!"
1,"GREAT ALBUM, CRAPPY EXTRA TRACKS","ThE ALBUM ITSELF IS CLASSIC SABBATH, FIVE STARS FOR IT, BUT THE EXTRA SONGS REALLY SUCK , WAY BELOW THE RELEASED VERSIONS, SO KEEP YOUR CASTLE REMASTERS OR THE RECENT BLACK BOX. NOTHING NEW IN SOUND QUALITY and an extra price not worth it."
2,Led Zeppelin Lead Sabbath,"Here's is my theory: Black Sabbath buys Led Zeppelin's first two albums, listens to them over and over, and goes into the studio to record their first two albums, which is actually regurgitated pieces of Led Zeppelin's first two albums. They even borrow the ""gloom and doom"" shtick, but lack Zep's nuance, charm, insight & humor. Paranoid is a monument to schlock and artifice. Despite being derivative and clunky, however, Black Sabbath inspired many others to likewise celebrate their lack of virtuosity and musical calling, paving the way for punk rock. Paranoid is an ugly job, but somebody had to do it."
2,Overrated,"Will everyone stop acting like they started metal and that the're a bunch of geniuses. LED ZEPPELIN IS THE KING OF IT ALL. The only reason people act like Sabbath is so good is because they hear other people say so and hop on the bandwagon instead of judging for themselves. I'm not saying that they're the worst band in the world but can we please stop worshipping them. DAMN YOU MTV!!!As for the album, it's kinda decent but certainly not the work of geniuses."
2,A tad evil...and scary!!,"The heavy riffs on this album are sludge-filled and dreary - and I guess that's how Black Sabbath wanted them, right? I'm perplexed by the lack of energy and innovation by this supposed historic band, on this their debut record.What's most strange, however, are the lyrics and demeanor of lead singer Ozzie Osbourne. What's his deal, anyway? I've come to know him as the fun-loving, very well-meaning dad on the hit t.v. show, ""The Osbournes."" Yet, on this record, his vocal delivery and tone is angry, depressing, and just plain strange, so different from his normal cheery self. Perhaps he was having a bad week in England when this ""monumental"" hard rock dross was being created.If you want true satanistic metal, get ""Unleash the Beast"" by Dokken, a much more revolutionary band.Check ya' later!!"
1,overrated,"This must be the most overrated album in history.It is certainly one of my biggest disapointments.The amazing debut album left me breathless and ready for more.The dark themes and eerie presentation were unprecedented.Then came PARANOID.You know there's gonna be trouble right at the first song.Anti war?!The dark persona disappeared immediately in a haze of juvenile politics.Hand of DOOM with it's anti drug theme further distances the evil.All hopes are dashed with the comic book lyrics of IRON MAN.I agree the music still cooks,and the concept of Riff rock evolves still further, but if the songs are stupid and laughable, who cares?"
1,Classic doesn't always mean masterpiece.,"Yes, the only reason you are here is for Iron man, paranoid, and war pigs....Ozzy was a horrible singer... Yes.Althought this album is over 30 years old, that doesn't mean its good does it? Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple are about the same age as Sabbath and they were just as bad.While the 60s did bring us all this ""shock rock"", atleast the classics have given us good artists from the disco era who are still remembered til today unlike those forgotten classic rock bands Led Zeppelin, Kiss, and The Doors.Plus, most classic metal sucked, with the exception of Rap-metal of the late 80s/early 90s.For good and truly inspritational metal, just listen to any of these modern MTV bands, because they are very groundbreaking."
4,Powerful lyrics,"This isn't my favorite album I own, but it's still a really good one. My favorite lyrical song of the whole album has to be War Pigs! The only song on here that I find average is the instumental Rat Salad.Highlights: Iron Man, Electric Funeral, Hand of Doom."
5,A must have!,"What can I really say about this album, This stuff is just perfect! all the songs are metal classics.I can easily say this is one of the greatest metal albums ever.Killer riffs, attitude and great lyrics, Paranoid has it all.Sabbath at his most inspiring moment, it's hard to find an album like this, Maybe their first album and Masters of reality are almost as good as this one, but Paranoid is in my opinion is their best work ever."
2,IT IS NOT AN SACD!,"I bought this for the SACD mentioned in the description. However, after receiving it, I found that it does not contain an SACD, but a standard DVD (not even DVD-Audio). I did a little research and discovered that Paranoid was never released on SACD. THE DESCRIPTION IS WRONG - NO SACD. I contacted Amazon about the blatant error, and they responded with ""...blah blah blah, talk to the seller..."" They didn't even acknowledge the erroneous description that I brought to their attention. I noticed that another review mentioned that the error was corrected, but as of the time of my purchase, and of this writing, it is still wrong."
5,"Not the best Sabbath album, but close!!!","Even though this isn't the greatest Sabbath album, it's still one of the great classics in Rock and Heavy Metal history. Since I have the remastered PARANOID now it sound's amazing coming thru my four INFINITY speakers. ""War pigs"" sound's great turned up loud on a quality system like I have. I definitely won't fault you, if you think this is the best Sabbath album of all time. I kind of get sick of ""Iron man"", and ""Paronoid"", being played constantly on my radio stations, but truly they are classic tracks. I haven't seemed to get tired of hearing ""Fairies wear boots"", to this point in my life. ""Electric Funeral"" is a little weird and freaky, but still classic Sabbath. This their second album is what really sent them to the top commercially. Their first just didn't have any smash hits, like PARANOID did. YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GO WRONG, BY PURCHASING THIS HEAVY METAL CLASSIC. LONG LIVE BLACK SABBATH!!!"
5,Essential Sabbath,"This is the penultimate Sabbath album. These are the songs that made the band famous. If you think songs like ""Iron Man"" and ""War Pigs"" are a bit overplayed, there are a few other gems here too. ""Hand of Doom"" is a track which shows Sabbath's heavy blues influence, while ""Electric Funeral"" is an oft forgotten classic.The instumentation here is excellent. I love Bill Ward's shuffling, understated style of drumming. It is a very welcome change from the heavy, elaborate style which dominated today in bands such as Metallica and Korn. Ozzy's vocals really shine throughout. Who would have thought an English guy could sing blues like this?If you want classic rock, this album is a must-have."
3,"Very Reccomended, yet Very Overrated","I'm sick of hearing about how this is THE Sabbath album. Actually, Out of the first 6 Sabbath albums (nearly always considered the best), Paranoid is probably the least interesting. Master Of Reality is THE Sabbath album to get! After that I would pick up the self-titled debut, or Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath."
5,Worth it's weight in platinum,Black sabbath were the original heavy meatl band along with blue cheer.paranoid is their best after vol 4 .the album features some of the best songs like paranoid and war pigs.Highly recommended to all rock fans.
3,Short and Sweet,"Paranoid is a great album but this is NOT A CD with a DVD-AUDIO disc. it's just a cd with a crappy dvd. Complete waste of $30. The cd sounds the same as the my old copy, but really i bought it only for the DVD-AUDIO disc..which isn't even included. Companys need to start looking at the items before writing a description. This must be the 4th time i've been burn by a overpriced CD. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY this if you want a DVD-AUDIO disc. The normal dvd has DTS and a LCPM stereo track that sounds WORSE than the cd. I do not see a reason to own this at all since the cd version is $7."
5,ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME!!!,"PARANOID is one of the moments that changed the music history forever! The Sabbath's debut is fantastic...It's just a PERFECT HEAVY ROCK METAL ALBUM!!!...But PARANOID got the same high level, maybe got more classic songs...WAR PIGS, the title track and IRON MAN are some of the most recognized songs of the world!!! PLANET CARAVAN is beautiful...ELETRIC FUNERAL is a raw sludge metal precursor...HAND OF DOOM is another heavy one...RAT SALAD is a nice instrumental and the great FAIRIES WEAR BOOTS close the album...If you like rock music you should listen to this Masterpiece!"
5,The soundtrack to my madness,"I grew up on this record. As Looney Tunes introduced me to classical music, Sabbath introduced me to mental instability. Thank you, Ozzy."
5,The best heavy metal album ever?,"A Classic. Thumping guitar solos, mind bending base and the ear bleeding rantings of the dark lord of rock, the ozmeister!Whilst I still maintain that The Zep's Immigrant song is the best short song ever, with Paranoid, the Sabbath, come a very, very close seccond.The highlight of the album for me is the end of War Pigs & start of Paranoid, it brings back memories of tearing down the M62 in the old mans big old Jag, with this blaring out of the windows and sunroof; saddly it had to end, in Hull!Buy it, play it every day, love it."
5,I'm paranoid for this album,"This is the greatest Black Sabbath album by far with the kick ass songs ""Paranoid"", ""Iron Man"" and ""War Pigs"". I love ""Paranoid"", Ozzy proves how great of a frontman he is when he sings the lyrics in this classic. Also Tony Iommi proves he is just as good as Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton with his precise guitar playing. Black Sabbath is the second greatest band ever right behind Led Zeppelin and beating Nirvana and Metallica. I've had this album for a very long time and I still love it just as much as when I got it. This is an album any metal, no, rock n' roll, no, music fan can't afford to be without."
5,The Start of Real Music,"Most reviewers miss the historical significance of Paranoid and Black Sabbath. They either weren't alive at the time or have forgotten how lame Sugar, Sugar by the Archie's truly was. This was the time of the Beach Boys and early Beatles (true, they were great, but tiresomely happy) and Black Sabbath changed all of that.During Vietnam many of us had quickly figured out how stupid this war was but not until ""War Pigs"" did these feeling get so brilliantly articulated. Space travel was all good until Ozzie explained how it had all gone so very wrong with ""Iron Man"".One of the most important albums of the rock era. A historic achievement."
4,"Great Packaging, Okay Sound!","This is Black Sabbath's most popular album and rightly so. The band that spawned countless imitators like Soundgarden and heck virtually every other heavy metal band that ever was shows just how it's supposed to be done in this album. From the brilliant intro of ""War Pigs"" to the great finale of ""Fairies Wear Boots,"" this album just flows along very well and is a classic. My favourite track is ""Iron Man"" with it's great guitar riffing and improvised pentatonic solo break in the middle, it's just THE classic heavy metal track. Now the album comes remastered in a really cool mini-lp replica sleeve. The only problem is that the master tapes must have really deteriorated as despite a very valiant remastering attempt, some tracks sound better than others but having heard the normal un-remastered version, I can tell you that this version is still light years better. This is the best version of the album that's out there for fans old and new alike. Recommended!"
5,SABBATH WERE THE GREATEST,"This surely is one of the best metal albums.It has everything:ozzy's great vocals,monumental guitar riffs and the greatest bass player I've ever heard.Every metal fan should have it."
2,What do we really get?...nothing new!!!,This review is for the over-priced triple cd called DELUXE EDITION. First the dvd is not a video dvd..umm pass!! Then on the bonus music disc we get nothing really interesting in these out takes..should have been left on the floor..you were right Tony almost not putting this out! Not so great packaging No lyrics come on! priced 3x the warner bros. versions. I was really forced to buy this set because i have vol. 4 and all by Santuary - so the run of 8 albums match but have no idea if these re-masters are any better than Warner. Of course PARANOID is unforgetable and changed rock history- It is a five star classic don't get me wrong but please don't make me buy it 4 times!!!!
3,sabbath's most overrated album,"i'm a die hard sabbath fan,but i have yet know why this album is considered the most popular album of sabbath.for me this ranks as sabbaths worst ozzy era album and third worst sabbath album of all time after seventh star and cross purposes.there's only 4 good songs on this album,they being paranoid,planet caravan,iron man and electric funeral with rat salad also being a decent instrumental track with some cool drumming by bill ward.war pigs is proberly the most overrated metal song of all time.for new comers to sabbath certainly the ozzy sabbath years i recommend you check out volume 4,master of reality and sabotage before you buy paranoid."
3,It sounds blanded!,"Well, after listen to this album for several times I have to admit that the sounds of this album is so simplistic.. I mean Tommy Iommi play simple 5th cord riffs.. And Ozzy Osborne sings note-for-note along Tommy's simple hook. Gee, It sounds blanded to me."
3,Black Sabbath,"Don't take this band too seriously. They are not Led Zeppelin or the Beatles. The musicianship is primitive, so what. Especially in later albums, the riffs are especially sludgey and uninspired, the lyrics are cheesy, etc. While this is true, Black Sabbath still hold great memories for me, when I was in 7th grade and didn't know or care about any of that. The magic is still there when listening to ""Planet Caravan"" or ""Fairies Wear Boots""."
1,crap,this is totally and utter crap iv seen better musician ship from simple plan cmon! it is so sludgey and has no meaning please!aim screen name: yoohooscoobydoo
1,BLACK SABBATH ARE TERRIBLE.,I hear this annoying band all the time on the radio. Paranoid is one of the most annoying and lousiest songs ever made. Avoid thisand go with the master of love songs insted of Dire Straits and Foreigner.
4,HEAVY METAL STAPLE,"PARANOID IS THE SECOND MOST CONSISTENT ALBUM THAT SABBATH HAS TO OFFER(BEHIND SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH) ALL OF ITS TRACKS BUT TWO ARE PLAYED FREQUENTLY ON THE RADIO AT HARD ROCK STATIONS. THE ONLY TRACK THAT DOESNT WORK FOR ME IS RAT SALAD, A POINTLESS INSTRUMENTAL AND PLANET CARAVAN(WHICH PUTS ME TO SLEEP) IN AMERICA PEOPLE GIVE THINGS 5 STARS EVEN IF ONLY HALF THE SONGS ARE GOOD. FOR ME A 5 STAR ALBUM MUST BE A MASTERPIECE WITH NO WEAK TRACKS(I HAVE ONLY FOUND TWO SO FAR AND THEY ARE IRON MAIDEN'S # OF THE BEAST AND SABBATH'S BLOODDY SABBATH)SINCE THIS ALBUM HAS TWO POOR TRACKS I GIVE 4 AND ONE HALF STARS BUT SINCE THERE IS NO 1/2 STAR IN THE RATING SCALE AND IT DOESNT DESERVE 5 IM GIVING 4"
5,LATE NIGHT RIDE YA'',BRING BACK THE PAST'' THOSE'S LATE NIGHT PARTY RIDES YA!! GOOD TO HEAR THE PAST.
3,Great music. Horrible sound quality.,"This is the roots of metal right here. Sure these songs are overplayed but there's a reason. These songs actually convey the anger and dispair that four young mmusicians for Birmingham, England faced. Their power can still be felt 30 years later. Unfortunately, the cd (at least the Warner version) is an audiophile's worst nightmare. It's plagued by excessive distortion, high end, and tape hiss. I've heard vinyl versions that sound better."
2,Major disappointment - bad Quad transfer,WARNING -The transfer of the quad mix was/ is just awful. As much as you want to hear this in surround it is painful. The mix is sad. I thought my surround speakers were blown. Now I understand why this was done without the band's consent.
1,I really need to read all the reviews posted before buying!!!,Maybe all who were duped can file a lawsuit against amazon and others involved... i have a difficult time finding true sacds and dvd audio at a decent price that has not been misrepresented or a bootleg. if you are a seller on amazon and want my business in the future please respond to this and refund my money .
2,Bargin Bin [stuff].,"The link you just clicked on is the Bargin bin [stuff]version of the Great *coughunderstatementcough* Black Sabbath album, Paranoid. This is one of those ""hurry we just realized that CD is going mainstream so release all the cataloge albums"" releases from the late 80's. It's rushed, using engineers that don't even know what they are doing, probably just new to the job, and have never heard what the original album sounds like, using eighties mastering technology. *shudders* That's a recipie for a rip off, folks. And what's ironic is that in the sleeve Warner Brothers claims that Compact Discs offers the best sound reproduction, and on the back of the case it says they've tried thier best to represent the original sound as a close as possible. Really? I never knew the original LP's sound so cold and weak!So in the end, only get this if you deperately need this album, but need to pinch pennies. Hey, that's the purpose these releases are serving now in the 21 century."
2,STrange feelings...,"I'ma huge Sabbath fan. I know, I know this album is considered a mark in the hystory of metal, etc, etc. But I just can't prefer it to Sabbath's debut or MASTER OF REALITY. The production here sounds without life, I don't know, something is not right here, even containing the classics. Of all Sabbath stuff with Ozzy, this is the second I listen less ( after Technical Ecstasy)."
5,One of Metal's alltime classics,"Black Sabbath's Paranoid is one of heavy metal's all-time classics. Paranoid is Ozzy and company's finest hour. Songs such as War Pigs, Paranoid,Iron Man, and Fairies Wear Boots highlight the album. Many of the tracks are played on classic rock radio these days. When you hear an album like Paranoid it's easy to hear why it's so influential to this day. Every metal fan should own this album, cause folks Sabbath is one of the groups that created heavy metal, if it weren't for these guys Metallica, Slipknot, your favorite metal band, etc would not exist. So don't be afraid and check out the CD that helped the genre get off the ground. You must own Black Sabbath's Paranoid!"
5,Music to raise your children with....,"I can still remember finding this record in my dad's collection and just being blown away by the cover of the album. Now that I look at the cover and I can't quite put my finger on what I thought was so cool about it maybe aside from the sword. Anyways, it's a damn good thing that I did think that the cover was cool because, that's exactly what got me to give this record a try. This record is fully responsible for my opinion of what ""rock & roll"" should be. There were many of other records in my dad's collection that affected my opinion of what I think is great music but, this one by far made the largest impression. When it comes to raising your children, skip The Beatles, wait on The Stones, and go straight Black Sabbath - Paranoid. This will not only assure that your child doesn't grow up to be a stinky hippy but, it will also give you the satisfaction that your child will have a good grip on what the true meaning of what ""Rock"" is meant to be."
4,GREAT ALBUM!!! I...AM...IRONMAAAANN!!!!!,Fast delivery. Arrived sooner than I thought! Just in time for the Marvel Comics motion picture release of IRON MAN. Thanks a lot!!!!
5,The true beginning of heavy metal,"Although on their first album Black Sabbath brought the world the first heavy metal album, Paranoid took heavy metal and shoved it down the throat of evry person on earth. Paranoid got wider exposure, and attracted many more people to heavy metal. That said, Paranoid is one great album. While containing Sabbath classics like War Pigs, Paranoid, an Iron Man(which contains the best Tony Iommi riff EVER....adn that's saying alot), it also contains my personal favorite Sabbath song, Electric Funeral. THat song just sounds so irresistably weird and has some great lyrics. Although Planet Caravan requires soem getting used to it's still a pretty good track. Overall this album is heavy and has formed the basis for almost all metal music. so go out there and get it. and i mean NOW"
1,"STILL waiting for a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition""","I just don't understand why record companies re-release CD after CD calling them ""new and improved"". CDs are low-fi crap no matter what you add to it. All the fancy packaging and additional music will never change that fact. It's still low-resolution 16 bit old technology.I don't see why they don't release a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition"" and give us an SACD as they did with the release of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's Brain Salad Surgery. It's phenomenal and a TRUE ""Deluxe Edition""."
2,Remaster me!!,"Dear Warner Brothers Records:Please find out what the word ""remaster"" means in industry lingo. It's obvious that you have no clue. This CD was released in 1990, for crying out loud. Just get the original master tapes and release a new, better, cleaner Paranoid CD. You can also include a few bonus tracks and extensive liner notes to further entice consumers. It's benefitial for you, because you can get people to buy a CD that they already own, and it's benefitial to music fans because they get much better sound quality and some extras.Please take a look at Columbia/Legacy's remasters of The Byrds' catalog to see how it should be done. You will make many music fans very happy if you start remastering your artists' catalogs. Especially ZZ Top, but that's a different matter.I'm waiting patiently for remastered Black Sabbath albums. Don't disappoint me."
2,Not a single improvement,"Better then a NEMS reissue, same as previous WB and not even close to a 2 lp Deluxe.Wait for a next one"
5,Missing a Digit,I believe it was Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath fame who played his guitar with the use of only three fingers. Fact or fiction?
2,I'll Give it SOME credit for originality,"This cd is a solid cd, and i loved it- for about a week. However, the simplicity of the songs makes the album loose its touch after a few listens. It, in my opinion, became very repetitive and dull after a couple of spins in my cd player and i doubt I will put it in again. Later cd's (and post Sabbath years) have much better song structures (gotta love Ozzy's Crazy Train!) All in all, it was just another brick in the wall... oh wait..."
5,Pleasure from 'Paranoid'; it's paradise.,"I am listening to the CD as I write this, and the song is Hand of Doom. Led Zeppelin were great, and they have been cited as the pioneering metal masters, and that is fine with me. This CD is my fave metal CD ever, along with some works of Iron Maiden. I first bought the casette in '88 and now own the CD. This CD has not dated. A fine piece of work from War Pigs to Iron Man to Fairies wear boots. My personal faves are Paranoid and the ultra-heavy Electric Funeral. Ozzy, Tony, Terry [Geezer] and Bill ROCK here. Very fun to listen to. This is the only Sabbath CD I own, and for me it's good enough and worth it."
5,HA HA HAAAAA!!!!,GOD! How long has it been since this band has released it's first album? Yet still this album is ALWAYS in my player. Ozzy; you rule: even if you did sell out beyond forgiveness; you deserve to do what you want now. I don't think I need to say much about this; no one track stands out more than the other: they're all shattering.
4,Ozzy is the weakest link. For real.,"The whole point of 70s hard rock / metal was to revel in stupidity. So the lyrics ain't Dylan. That's OK. Iommi/Butler/Ward crank out major riffage. It's a textbook of riffs. In fact, Geezer is a hell of a bass player. Ozzy? Meh. I burst out laughing at his chant of 'electric funeral!"" Is this intentionally funny?"
3,This is DVD-Video NOT DVD-A nor SACD,"I just read about this in Sound & Vision magazine (Sept 09). According to the reviewer... ""How black (read: awful) is this Sabbath in the 1974 quad mix of its 1970 masterpiece? Let me count the ways: instruments that leap between channels, excessive vocal reverb, muffled sonics overall""...""the repurposing for DTS 5.1 on DVD-Video (not DVD-Audio, as the package misleads)"". Reviewer gave this a 1/5 stars for the surround mix, but compliments it on the bonus disc with instrumental versions of the album and a great booklet."
4,Played at many a party in the 70's,"This album was played at almost all (of a certain kind of) parties when I was in high-school. The shear power is what is noteworthy on this album. Legend has it that it was made by a bunch of working class kids from Birmingham that didn't know any better. It isn't sophisticated, but is powerful, with a drummer that was rumored to strike through the skins of the drums he hit them so hard, and some great guitar solo's as well as the Oz himself. Included is the Heavy Metal song so good it even made it to AM pop radio when it came out, ""Iron Man"", but it is just one of a whole album full of great songs. If I was still of that age and culture, I would rate this a full five stars, but I am kind of old to listen to much BS these days.So here's the deal, if you want a great example of Hard Rock of the 70's this is a great place to look."
4,More like 5 stars but one track is weak,"Great album with many of black sabbaths greatest songs. The music on here is very catchy and addicting. This is a cd that everyone should own metal fan or not. The only song I don't realy listen to that much is ""iron man"" because I hear it so god dam much that it is starting to piss me off! It is still a good song though,but the other tracks are better. A LANDMARK IN METAL! GET IT NOW! JESUS AS$ RAPING CHRIST NOW I HAVE THAT IRON MAN SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD! ALSO RECOMENDED:MASTERS OF REALITY,BLACK SABBATH,AND SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH"
4,a clear step up from the first album,"Whereas the first album had a couple real standouts, this has several and the ""filler"" songs are much better than before. They really had it going on all cylinders on this one and I'm looking forward to continuing thru their catalog."
4,Quad review,Added this to my growing surround sound collection (something around 75 discs now). Some of the reviews had me hoping to hear a mostly different album - but there were only about 3 times that I felt I was hearing something that wasn't included in the stereo mixes. Most of the surround effects had Tony's small fills in different channels. Ozzy's vocals seemed muted on War Pigs - but okay otherwise.Still a must have for anyone wanting to cover the originals of metal. A new surround mix of the first album would be even better!!
2,Review of Paranoid (Limited Edition),"Fans who are already familiar with Black Sabbath's work are probably wondering if it is worthwhile to shell out the extra money for the limited edition of this album. The limited edition is the same as the Castle Remasters, except an attempt is made to replicate look and feel of the original album. Unfortunately, that is all there is. There are no extra liner notes, lyrics, artwork, etc. which come with the circa '96 Castle remasters. Also, the packaging is not very sturdy and there is an annoying amount of adhesive on the flap of the plastic dust cover. If you are collector, you are not going to want to play this album often in light of the wear and tear that will inevitably come. This is truly for the diehard completist, but a casual fan should stick with the normal Castle import catalog."
5,"Kleenex, PLEASE!!","Oh, my goodness... I just finished this series and feel completely wrung out of tears. Yes, you'll cry yourself silly but, WOW, what a story! Highly recommended! Had my heart racing (for various reasons!) from beginning to end. Others have recapped the story so I won't...but about 30% of the viewers on a website I frequent call this drama ""life altering."" Not sure I'd go that far, but the story will stay with you long after the viewing ends."
2,Extremely Sappy Soap,"Ok, I have to admit there are some good qualities about this series - it is original and the acting managed to tear me up a couple of times. However, half the series consisted of sappy love scenes where the lead characters waver between one another and make stupid decisions that put their own lives in peril for the sake of love.I have watched many Asian soaps in my time when I was younger and have seen some outstanding ones. This is not one of them.Overall, the series tries too hard to evoke emotions out of viewers. I do not recommend the series if you're looking for a good love story. Watch North and South if you want a true love series OR Chunhyang if you're into a feel good Korean flick."
3,dated writing,"I remembered these from when I was a teenager as great stories. I've changed a lot. These stories are okay for a young reader but if you know good writing when you see it, it's weak, very weak. Bolos are really just noble buffoons, willing to die and kill for honor. When they are invented, they will make great Demopublican party members. Higher reasoning skills aside, they seem about as able to reason as an attack dog. Wisdom does not equal speed of computation. Ah well, young people might enjoy it."
2,Disappointing,"Sorry, but these short stories didn't do anything for me. Maybe I just don't like Laumer's style. Call it Hammer's Slammers without the action. One of the stories (""Courier"") isn't a Bolo story. It's a Retief story that I've seen elsewhere under at least two other titles."
1,"NOTHING new, just reprints of old stories! Not worth it!","Very, Very disappointed. I have all of the Bolo books and love them, but this was nothing new, and that is what I expected. Some of the stories do not even fit in with the newer ones. If you want to read his oldest stuff, or are a first time reader, then this might be a good start. Paying a premium price is not worth it."
5,Best Grip You'll Find,"This grip is by far the best out there, and is definitely a wise investment. I started using it last December when I saw it in a sporting goods store, and I decided to buy it; I wrappe it on my racquet and when I went out to hit, I was amazed at how the grip tackles moisture and tight hands. It gets dirty pretty fast, but at about a dollar twenty five each grip, it's definitely a good choice to buy this."
3,Weak.,"While the price is right, and they look pretty cool, you'd be better served spending a few more bucks and get something better made. While this setup is servicable in the mid range, like others have said the sound gets unbalanced at low volume and you don't have to pump them up too loud before the bass gets distorted. Another thing that niggles me is that the remote only allows you to change the volume of the front and rear speakers seperately, so if you get the prefect balance between them, if you want to lower the volume you have to readjust them. Don't nickle and dime your sound, spend some more coin and really rattle your neighbours."
2,good for surround but in a real small room,these speakers are good looking but their sound is really bad they do give excellent surround and can be useful for decorating your home but not listening the woofer is really really horrible it is worst than any other woofer i have ever seen the woofer doesnt at all give bass if we incease the volume to a certain level the woofer starts distorting a lot the remote control is also not comfortable IN SHORT THE SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT AT ALL WORTH BUYING IF YOU DONT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SPEND UR MONEY ON U CAN AS WELL BUY THIS SYSTEM JUST FOR THE SAKE OF DECORATION BUT I ADMIT THE FRONT REAR EFFECTS ARE GOOD SO 2 STARS FOR THAT
2,Can't see a thing,"How hard could it be? I spent 3 hours with my son tried to see the crescent moon and all I saw was the flickering of my eyelashes. Yes, I did follow the manual."
1,Taver Brin,This telescope was a vast dissappointment.Easy to assembleImpossible to locate and track objects in the night sky withDon't waste your money on a Bushnell product unless you get a chance to try it out before you purchase it.We are now thinking about hanging flower pots from it! Can't think of any other useful purpose!?
4,Very sharp!,"...I took a good look at this monitor, and chose the Viewsonic VP191 even though that one cost a good a hundred and fifty bucks more---mainly because the Viewsonic allows me to turn the screen ninety degress so I can view entire Office documents and web pages.Otherwise, these Samsungs with their 800:1 contrast ratios offer terrific bang for the buck. Really sharp, though not quite as bright as the Viewsonics despite their slightly higher cdm ratings. But I have many friends who are quite happy with their Samsungs, and I have an old Samsung 17"" CRT which has held up well over a couple years' heavy usage. In short, when you compare Samsung monitors to the really cheap 250-300 dollar off-brands, in my opinion the extra hundred or so you spend for the Samsung is well worth it for most people's uses."
4,A very nice monitor for the money,"Just bought this monitor at Comp USA with over $120 in rebates. A 19"", 800:1 ratio monitor for $349 out the door that used to retail for over $470! It has a bright clear picture with no dead pixels. Sure, DVI input would have ben nice, but at this price that's something I can live without."
5,Excellent view of the Maya civilization,"This is a great video for anyone interested in the mysterious Mayan civilization. The photography and story telling are superb and only make the viewer hungry for more. I would recommend this video for anyone of any age, whether a history buff or just casual viewing. If you are a true history lover you must get this one. It is a real gem!"
2,"Good, but the least exciting of the series","There is classic Seal Team Seven action in the first part of the book, but then we get to read a lot about Murdock and company hanging around Coronado and on an aircraft carrier waiting to go into action. A majority of this latest book in the series spends too much time in plot development and gets away from what really makes the Seal Team Seven series worth reading - non-stop action and superior firepower.The rating given is relative to the other books in this series; all of which rate a 4+ or better. I recommend reading several of the other books so you can get a real appreciation of Murdock's Seal Team and their missions.I am a devoted fan of both the Seal Team Seven and the Carrier series and I look forward to the next book in each series."
2,Not the best,"Normally I enjoy this series incrediable. But lately, and this book in particular, the stories are loosing too much factual material to them. This book took too long to develop and the characters are getting flat, they have no personality like the earlier books."
2,pretty images of young people,"I felt like I was watching ""the real world"" from MTV. The film is more about the riders than kitesurfing really. I'd say 90% drinking and partying and talking about themselves, 10% riding. Which is a real shame because the kiteboarding parts are amazing. When they get on the water, they definitely knock your socks off. Really beautiful photography, including underwater footage of them swimming (!). I reckon they didn't have enough riding footage to fill the hour so they just shot themselves hanging out. Not exactly what I was expecting from ""A kiteboarding experience"". Would be okay as a rental but I'm not sure it's worth a buy."
3,"Spacey, Stoned and Barrettesque","This had been released twice as 'The Missing Link to Tyrannosaurus Rex' (Cleopatra - USA) 'Crazy Diamond' (Angel Air - UK) and is based on home tapes recorded with Took and Various Pink Fairies and (most likely) Syd Barrett in various stages of intoxication and should be taken as such. It does contain some enjoyable tracks, does 'grow on you' and has a nice `spaciness' feel. There is a very high likelihood that Syd Barrett does appear on these tracks. For more information see the ""So you'd like to... Learn more about Steve Peregrin Took"" Guide. For the best Steve Took music released to date check out his ""Steve Took's Horns"" release ""Blow It!!!"""
2,Not reliable-I think I received a lemon,"I think I got a lemon. Sometimes when I click, it may, for example, go from 20 to 221. Oh well!"
3,WALKING TALLY COUNTER,IT'S OK BUT IT GET'S STUCK ALOT AND IT WILL MESS UP YOUR COUNT IF YOU DONT REMEMBER IT BUT FOR THE MONEY IT WILL DO.
4,"Excellent, but needs something more.","Like many other Jewel fans, I immediatley purchased this book when I saw that it in the store. The book seems to be written like a teen magazine, but was still enjoyable to read. It did give some interesting stories of Jewel, though. Unfortunatley, much of the information was taken from other magazine articles. If you are a true Jewel fan, and have many of the magazine articles about her, you may get bored during some parts. Overall, I still enjoyed this book (especially the 16 pages of pictures!) The Jewel pictures and the new information make this book worth buying!"
2,"Interesting, but not much beyond mere speculation","I was browsing through the Video On Demand and came across this video. I thought, ""For the price of a rental, I can own it and watch whenever I want!"" so I bought it. I really wish I could have rented it first. Mr. Albert is an interesting speaker and he does have some interesting questions. Unfortunately, they really don't have to do with his areas of ""research,"" in physics, astronomy, etc. He seems to pontificate more on the biological questions about disease and how we put too much flavor in our food, which makes us more tasty to the bacteria and viruses. Really? At 18 minutes into the video, I had to stop it. Maybe, I'll go back to it at another time, but I have to go change my flavoring by having an adult beverage first..."
2,Ok value,"I purchased this in preperation for a litter of kittens, of course the next day I found the same product for half the price. It is a good product must overpriced here."
1,GARBAGE,"I WOULDN'T WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT, IT IS GARBAGE AND DOES NOT WORK. HAD TO GO TO MY LOCAL PET STORE AND SPEND THE $23 TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. FROM NOW ON I WILL SPEND THE MONEY NECESSARY TO GET THE JOB DONE. THIS PRODUCT IS A FAIL!!!"
4,arguably London's best album for the Capitol label,"'Around Midnight' is probably Julie London's greatest album from her days with Capitol. There's a dizzying jazz arrangement of ""Lonely Night in Paris"", a well-judged ""Misty"", and a suitably sultry ""Don't Smoke in Bed"" lends itself perfectly to London's style.The biggest irony of Julie London's singing career was the fact that she never could give herself enough credit. She never felt her voice was special, and constantly downplayed her abilities. In the realm of the great jazz ladies, there was nobody who could touch her, nor will there ever be. Julie London was a complete original, and this reissue of 'Around Midnight' will be welcomed with open arms by her legion of fans.[Blue Note Records/EMI 0946 3 69810 2 4]"
5,Great Taste and Easy to follow,"So far I have made several things from this book and cant get enough! I cook for my friends and am always trying to come up with new recipes to try when I came across this book and had to buy it one the spot. The recipes are easy to prepare, the ingredients are not hard to find either. I am going to get her other cookbooks, if they are anything like this one I will be so happy. There is a section in this book that has come amazing marinades and surprize you do not need to marinate them overnight. Highly recommend this cookbook escpecially if you are into the Asian Fusion genre."
3,One Of Heather's Early Works!,"Long before her Vivid Video glory days and her days as a photographer, hip-hop artist and model, Heather Hunter started out with Vidway Video out of her home state of New York City.Hung Jury is just your average adult movie. It gets three stars from me. Two of them are for Heather alone (her scenes, while clearly porn, have some erotic and I dare say class to them) and one is for one of her guest stars named Tami Monroe (who plays the judge in this film).Incidentally, Heather would do a similiar film years later for Vivid called ""The Judge"" with a similiar plot but with a mostly African-American cast while this one is mostly white except for Heather.Would recommended it mainly to Heather Hunter fans."
3,"OK tomatoes, cans were dented","These tomatoes taste better than the average canned tomato. However, when tasting side by side I found that Bionaturae brand canned tomatoes tasted a little better, but were much cheaper and there were more tomatoes in a can and less liquid. The strianese tomatoes came well packaged, but despite this, 1/3 of my cans were dented."
5,Best Tomatoes Ever,Absolutely the best canned tomatoe I have ever used. You can almost feel the sunshine on your face the taste is so fresh. [[ASIN:B000N36F9E Strianese Whole Peeled D.O.P. San Marzano Tomatoes 14 Oz. Can) I cook a lot and Italian is a favorite. With these tomatoes I get a more authentic flavor. Will not go back to store brands.
3,2 1/2 stars,"On the inside of the dust jacket, the publishers say this book should be a good read for fans of Quentin Tarantino. It is a BIG lie. The publishers must have owed this author a favor. This book is just not good.However, having said that, I am not upset I spent my time reading it. If you like crime-noir, read Ellroy. But, if you have this book, and have to spend a few hours on a plane or waiting to be picked for jury duty, then give it a try."
3,"BUT, THERE IS THAT VOICE!","It's that voice, the soft dulcet tones that can frame a threat as easily as an endearment. It's the voice that drove Blake Carrington to distraction on TV's ""Dynasty."" No one could read the words of Joan Collins as truly as the actress herself, and so she does.Granted, those words are a bit of fluff, but who doesn't need ear candy once in a while?Gorgeous and red-headed, Millie McClancey is the product of famine ravaged Ireland. She's poor but star struck, and she makes it big on the stage. As a matter of fact, she's the first of four generations to do so. Following in their turn are her daughter, Vickie, and later her granddaughter, Lulu.Each, of course, leads a tumultuous life fraught with love and danger. ""Star Quality spans the generations from early 20th century London to Broadway today, while Collins spices the years with sex, secrets and success.Predictable? Yes.But, there is that voice.- Gail Cooke"
3,"a juicy, daring story","The saga of four women whose lives span the 20th century, all of them finding their passion in the performing arts. From stagestruck Millie of World War I to her award-winning great-granddaughter today, we follow these boisterous, enduring & ambitious women - through fame & fortune on London & New York stages, to Hollywood, to careers in singing, theater & film. Through passionate love affairs, disastrous marriages & lifetime enmities.Racing through the decades, each a time capsule of fashion & news, swirls through the world of celebrities & accomplishments. As an enduring celebrity herself, Joan Collins knows from whence she writes!STAR QUALITY is a galloping, breathless adventure, recommended for everywoman who loves a juicy, gossipy, daring story, sketched with a broad brush, sometimes hilarious language, & those daily life details as cultures change, relationships grow & die, that fascinate fans of historical romance."
5,I loved it!,"I don't know what everyone is complaining about. It's FICTION! The dates don't need to be perfect. I really loved this book, and couldn't put it down. Following the generations of women stars was interesting. The ending is pleasant as well. What can I say? It's a typical Collins novel, but I found that this one did have less sex than usual and a better storyline (which is nice for a change!). Give it a try!"
2,A Beach Book,"OK, so, as one reviewer said, this is a no-brainer book and we need that sometimes.Predictable...yes, but this book has enough twists and turns and even an occasional surprise to actually make you want to continue to the next chapter to see ""What happens next?""As I titled it, ""A Beach Book,"" a book to enjoy along with the sand and surf."
2,Dynasty star should stick to acting,"I am a huge Joan Collins fan, all the way back to her Dynasty days. However Star Quality was boring, and predictable. Joan should stick to acting, her sister though, Jackie Collins is a great author check her out."
3,"BUT, THERE IS THAT VOICE!","It's that voice, the soft dulcet tones that can frame a threat as easily as an endearment. It's the voice that drove Blake Carrington to distraction on TV's ""Dynasty."" No one could read the words of Joan Collins as truly as the actress herself, and so she does.Granted, those words are a bit of fluff, but who doesn't need ear candy once in a while?Gorgeous and red-headed, Millie McClancey is the product of famine ravaged Ireland.

5,Great for the Size and Price,"Great air cleaner for the size and price. For effectiveness you want to make sure you use it in rooms smaller than it is rated for.Although we use it in a small 17x17' home office, with a cat litter box and quite a lot of office machines (laser printers, desktop/server, external hard drive/rack, etc) we also have a larger Blue Air air cleaner in the same office running at the same time. The smaller (again, intended for MAXIMUM 10.96x10.96' or 120' foot rooms) Holmes still needs cleaning every 3 weeks maximum."
2,Overpriced Fan,"I purchased this item based on the positive reviews. Its a lovely fan, and the noise is tolerable even on the highest level. However, as an air purifier, this unit is worthless. I ran it for one month continuously, in a dusty apartment with a cat and a dog. At the end of the month, there wasn't a speck of dust in the filter. It was pristine! The inside of the unit has this little filter indicator that confirms that a bright white filter is ""brand new"" as opposed to one that's ""in use."" So, if you want a nice fan, this is the unit for you."
2,Doesn't hold up,I have owned a few of these and after less then two years they started making a grinding noise.Not Recommended!
3,Not for the Absent Minded,"This combo works just fine as a mouse and keyboard. However, I ended up replacing my original in a very short period of time because I kept dropping the mouse off the edge of my desk. The mouse was sturdy but it could only take so much abuse before it went to mousie heaven.The other problem I had was a tendency to wander away from the desk while holding the mouse. Later, after a half hour of frantic searching, I would find it on the file cabinet, in my pocket, in my brief case. It was harder to keep up with than my ink pens.I eventually bought a wireless Stealth keyboard with a pointing device built in and have had it for the last two years without a problem."
2,The British Monarchy starving Boer children,"British terrorism against Boer civiliansThe book is certainly well written, but it does not provide information on the destruction of the two Boer Republics by means of starving Boer children in concentration camps. It does not say how the British broke their promises in giving the Boer Republics sovereignty by the Sand River Convention. Nor does it comment on how England broke the Hauge Convention by killing Boer livestock, burning Boer homes, and whipping Boer women, children, the sick, disabled and elderly onto soiled trucks meant for animals to the 39 concentration camps in South Africa. The torturous deaths of the children are not even mentioned. Leaving out this destruction of the two Boer Republics is like someone writing about American history of 2001 ago, omitting the destruction of the twin towers."
3,Every history book should be written in this style!,This book should become a textbook in English history class.I found it entertaining (although I am not British!).Mr. James has a mixture talent of a historian and a novelist
2,"What, no mention of Armenian massacres!!??",I found it hard to sink my teeth into such a lengthy book which covered many events surrounding the middle east in 1915 BUT made no mention of the 2.5 million armenians killed by the Ottoman turks in April of 1915. Many British schools and orphanages in Turkey were bloody disaster areas at this time. One can't help but wonder if Mr. James has fallen prey to the bribes by the current Turkish powers - the same powers who have successfully kept this huge fact out of many history and travel books...
1,Don't waste your money...and I usually like cheap hotels,"I must admit that I am really disappointed with this book. I don't think it's worth the money at all. The information in the book is meager. It offers nothing more than some pretty pictures, a lot of blank space, and a list of all the hotel's contact information in the back. What I hate the most is the tiny, hard-to-read captions about each picture. For Christ' sake, for all the blank space in the book, the editor could not choose a bigger and more readable font? I was expecting more detailed description about each hotel listed in the book. As for the writer's comments about the repulsiveness of the polyester bedspread in the charaterless chain hotel rooms and the charm of those little, cheap hotels, she is preaching to the choir because people who would spend money to buy this book are already the kind of travelers looking for this kind of lodging."
2,"I watched it from a DVD rental company, Didn't think much of it....",I've studied Wing Chun and Jeet Kune Do along with some other styles.I was hoping to maybe pick up some insights that I hadn't been exposed to from my training.There wasn't much to recommend this DVD if you have taken even a few lessons.It was boring and all so basic.I often wonder how such mediocre books or DVDs get so many high ratings.I think it's because people like the subject and don't really grade the product that is talking about whatever subject they are in to.My advice would be to skip it but if you are dying to see what's in it then try Netflix or maybe one of the other rental places such as BushidoDVD or Blockbuster. They used to carry it. Not sure if they still do.
2,Ah its so so..,"Not too happy with this DVD. I would say more then half of the DVD is showing how to stretch. It should be called Bruce Lee's Stretching method.. Be cautious on spending your hard earned money, as I feel this is a waste."
4,A good book!,"Unlike The Oath & The Measure,The Companions,Darkness & Light and Kendermore, this actually fits into the Dragonlance saga - a few days after the Companions seperate & almost a month before Raistlin takes the Test.Unlike those others books, the writing's very good as well. I'd definately recommend this one."
1,The Worst Dragonlance Book I've Read!,"As an avid Dragonlance fan, I was severely disappointed with this novel. It had absolutely no bearing on any of Tanis' further adventures and didn't even begin to answer Tanis' questions about his father. ( BTW, for an EXCELLENT view of that tale, read ""The Inheritance.) Tanis had stated in the Chronicles that he'd been in lands not friendly to elves, but this was set in an Elven village; the Red Robed mage was part human, part elf, and the only acceptable mages to elves are White Robes; and to add insult to injury we get bogged down in a sappy love story and end up in the place of Death, where apparently silver dragons get to breathe fire instead of the breath weapon of cold that they're born with! Makes you wonder if the authors read the original works at all. I'd love to see a well-written book about what happened to Tanis in the five years prior to the Chronicles, but this wasn't it."
2,Could have been better,"As with quite a few of the Preludes and Meetings books, this seemed out of tune with the Chronicles view of Tanis. There is a certain way the Tanis talks and acts, but these authors couldn't quite seem to grasp it.The plot was slightly ridiculous. I find it difficult to believe Tanis would even consider starting on this adventure just to find news about his father.I don't usually object to a bit of love mixed into a story, but when it becomes the story to the exclusion of all else, I start to worry.The whole thing about Death was stupid. This, along with the rest of the happenings in the book, is never mentioned by Tanis in the Chronicles series. A lot of the Preludes are a bad conclusion to a good idea.In saying all this, I still enjoyed the first half of the book. The rest really set my teeth on edge."
3,..stereotypically Tanis..,"I've got a mind to ask if Tracy Hickman could have done better. Inconsistency runs amok among most of the follow up DL companion o; But then again if your an avid DL fan you learn to deal with it , insert what you think is right , change a few minor details and get on with the story..which is important. Without a doubt the name ""Tanis"" always coincides with ""Romance"". He's DL's answer to Casannova. Expect more of the same before you even pick up the book. Pick it up. It's not great but it's better than most. If anything ; Tanis probably matured , in this book , to be the leader he was fondly remembered for."
2,Terrible,"The plot was terrible... it got confusing at times and the characters were just too....abnormal...like tanis was supposed to have a good leadership and all but it doesn't quite show.In the chronicals, it said that tanis had spent the 5 yrs b4 the war of the lance in qualinesti to see where he belonged. that was the reason i bought the book. I thought that it would be more interesting too.this was a bad book and i suggest that u would choose to buy another one."
2,Not what it could have been...,"As with all amateur book reviewers with lots to say, I'll begin with... Ohh, where to start? I am a fan of the DragonLance series, and found this book disappointing. Not because it was poorly written, which it wasn't, but because the plot of this book did not tie in well with the main plot of the entire series. It seems to me like the authors were more interested in expressing the characters' love for each other than adding to the world of Krynn. So, basically, it all boils down to wheather or not you're into all that mushy, goey love stuff. I think there are other books you should read first, but that's just me."
2,As leader of the Heroes he seems defamed.,"I named two of my children after characters in the Dragonlance series. It gave me and many others hope, in a world that recently has had little. I originally read the books in 1985 and on and on. Flint's death was OK, it added to the plot. Even Sturms untimely demise was within limits. The latest incarnation, considering how strong the group was, is just simply ludicrous. They have slain all that we have hoped for all these years as followers. A classic never dies it just keeps moving on and on and.... Tracy and Margaret have destroyed the little hope that I have held for mankind and my dreams. BRING BACK OUR HEROES!!!!!!"
3,A good book but they hurt Tanis,The author was exelent. He has you guessing from the get-go. But he tried to make Tanis (an already great caractor) his own. The problem is that Tanis' entire personality is differnt (and wrong). The problems range from the way he talks to what he does to the way he thinks. You'll find yourself thinking that this is a compleetly differnt person and he's not anywhere as good as he used to be.
3,Good but not great,"Well, I must say I did enjoy this book. It is a worthy read if you are a Dragonlance fan. With that said it is not the best one out there. It was a very interesting story and very different, but Tanis was not quit the same as in the Chronicles. They did write him a little differently and that is what kept it from being great."
1,What ?,"Tribute to who? If you really like Pink Floyd, don't spend your money on this awful album... O xente ta ruim demais !"
4,Very entertaining book,"I believe Houston is a great city, both for business and pleasure. It is also a place with many fun things to do. If you have people visit or if you want a great weekend with the family, read this excellent book and make it a better experience. Another great resource for information on Houston who might want to consider a long term relationship with the city is www.houstonbusiness.com. But for fun, read Karen's book."
5,wonderful,"wonderfully sensitive, outstanding photos <B> transported me to the essence of being in the <B>wilderness with this spendid animal."
2,Alcohol wipes in a bottle...,"I think I was expecting too much, but this product basically only cleaned the area. You get what you pay for on this one."
1,not happy with item,"Used this on a new Tens pad, it left a dull finish and now I cannot use the pad without it. It may be better to use it when the Tens pad have been used for a while and very little gum is left on it."
2,Serves No Purpose,"This product does not help with pad adhesion. Moreover, I had trouble with the applicator. It appears to be fancy, overpriced rubbing alcohol. Try another skin preparation product instead. This product is definitely not worth five dollars."
4,"Good product, decent price","Works well for the TENS pads, though it is just a tiny bit too watery for my tastes. I use the TENS for nerve stimulation for shoulder pain, and while this gel works great for the pads for conduction of the electricity, the wateryness of them makes it hard for the self adhesive to work well, so they usually slide off. I only use the conductive gel when the pads are older, or when I am waiting on a new shipment of pre-gelled pads to come in, because I much prefer the pre-gelled pads over using the conductive gel. However, this is nice to have on hand in cause you run out of pre-gelled pads that are new while you're waiting for a shipment to come in, to refresh some older pads so you don't have to go without."
3,This may be better for SINGLE use pads...,"It isn't any better than using rubbing alcohol for my money. Also, if you have some very sticky pads to begin with this makes them ULTRA sticky and you will hammer your pads quickly. I've had better results using rubbing alcohol. Possibly this solution may work better if you have pads which aren't ultra sticky to begin with???"
3,Conductive skin preparation pretreatment,"Just my opinion, I have found it easier to swipe the skin with rubbing alcohol prior to applying the electrode patch. Ounce for ounce, rubbing alcohol is cheaper and I don't notice any difference when utilizing the tens unit."
2,Really??,"Save your money and buy rubbing alcohol. Shame on anyone who charges so much for something that is so little. It really makes you think you need this when you don't , just use rubbing alcohol on you skin. Didn't help much anyway the pads only lasted 3 uses. I regret this purchase and you will too."
4,Great,I bought this along with an electrode machine and together they work perfectly! It's a must have for me and it should be for you as well!
4,Easy application,The Pre-Tens conductive Skin prep has a great roller ball applicator that makes getting read to apply the pads easy and hassle free.
1,STONE COLD RIP OFF,"item contains 100% alcoholyou know the kind thats 4.95 a pint at the drug store and at 4.95 whos going to return it when the postage is 4.90""CAVET EMPTOR"""
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Don't waste your money on this overpriced product! If I had read the reviews before I purchased this I could have saved my money. Use alcohol, it works the same and is so much cheaper."
2,its just rubbing alcohol,"Just buy a bottle of rubbing alcohol and cotton balls, pretty much the same thing. Also, the bottle doesn't give off the liquid very well. It was cheap, otherwise I would have been mad."
3,Just use alcohol swabs instead,"This is a very expensive alternative for the same effectiveness and the same smell as using an alcohol swab to clean the skin. What's worse is that the pad leaks so much liquid that you have to be very careful not to hold the bottle horizontal or upside down or there will be way too much liquid released. Overall, I felt this was a waste of money."
2,overpriced,"I wished i had researched this more before I bought it. I thought it was the GOO that went on the sticky pads for the TENS unit, my mistake,,,,!!This stuff is just overpriced alcohol for cleaning the skin but they make it sound like super great stuff, their mistake,,,,!! I will not make my mistake again."
2,Electrode gel,I'm not completely satisfed with this gel; it's very thin and also hard to get out of the bottle's applicator top. I can't say I'm very knowledgable about medical equipment but it's not what I expected.
2,Save Your Money !,This item is over priced and basically isopropyl alcohol in a designer bottle. Drop into you local shopping center and save yourself some cash by purchasing cottonballs and alcohol to prep for your therapy.
1,"Use alcohol instead, and save, and no aluminum","This product is mostly alcohol, and some ""antiperspirant"" aluminum (which is a toxic metal to use). It's not worth the price, and not worth the danger of aluminum. Just use alcohol (rubbing alcohol or vodka)!"
4,Pad Gel,It worked very well. It kept the connection from the pad to my skin to get the full electrical stimulant of the massager to the sore mucsle in my neck
4,Alcohol works as well........,Covidien - Uni-patch Pre-Tens Conductive Skin Preparation Pre-Treatment skin prep - 2 oz bottleAlcohol swabs work as well if not better. I am saving my money and using what is in most medicine cabinets for less money.
5,Covidien,"Very good product, Drip proof and easy to roll on your skin. Just remember to let it dry completely before attaching your electrodes."
1,NO IDEA,"NOT CERTAIN WHY I WAS ASKED TO REVIEW THIS PRODUCT SINCE IT WAS NEVER SENT WITH MY ORDER, I ORDERED A TENS UNIT AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME WITH IT BUT I NEVER RECEIVED IT."
3,Gel,Not really much to write about. I got this with my tinz unit and it works like it is suppose to.
5,review,"A must have to prolong life of pads of unite, only is practical to purchase it, in saving one money."
3,it wasnt great,I was misunderstood about this stuff. I really didn't need it and it was a waste of money I certainlty wont buy it again.
2,Cute but painful,"I wore these shoes once and they absolutely killed my feet. Haven't worn them since, which is unfortunate because they're so cute and versatile."
4,upset with the shipping................,"the shoes are cool, they just didn't get here in time for the party i wanted them for.........so i am upset about the shipping.....but i will use the shoes for something else............"
5,Mini Walking Dead,"Overall, this is a great show, just too short. Only 5 episodes leaves you wanting more. Acting and special effects are very good. I would highly recommend it."
4,fast zombies with a traditional feel.,"Really enjoyed this series. I just think it ended too soon. As soon as all the players were in place, the story ended instead of building. The acting is spot on and loved the use of music. The song Grace Kelly playing while zombies rip out throats is a nice touch. Must see for the zombie traditionalist, even with the fast zombies."
2,Not Too Good,"Picture is very grainy at best, incompatable with HP keyboard. Has a tendency to lock up with the new Windows Media player. Bottom line...wish I'd bought something else."
3,good for videoconferencing,"Good for the price. If you want a camera for pics, this is not the one. I only use for videoconferencing. The software will trick you into thinking you need to pay for membership at spotlife in order to videoconference. Don't fall for it. You can use microsoft netmeeting in your windows software for free!!"
1,Terrible!,"The only good thing about this cam is it is very easy to setup... other then that it ain't good whatsoever,the image quality is very bad even with good lighting.. in low light - forget it you can not see ANYTHING. And no matter what settings you use the image is always terribly grainy, you have to take pix of your face very closeup to see any kind of detail and still its hard to makeout..I dont recommend this cam to anyone - not even a newbie.. My QuickCam VC (parralel port) that I got 3 yrs ago works better then this thing!"
3,Nice little cute thing with o.k. technology.,This camera has a pretty o.k. look for the price but it sometimes provides slow or shaky streaming media. The colors provided are extremely poor and are not for the person who wants to create a good look on his website. It's just a affordable camera for those who want to talk over the phone on the internet. Buy it if your not in the mood for spending 500 dollars on a good computer-cam.
5,"For a WebCam, not bad at all...","paying ""($) dollars"" for an easy setup, plug & play webcam, i think this is realy good.1. its image is realy good for just ($) dollars if you adjust the camera's focus correctly by turning the camera's lens (green or black circle around the lens) to make the image more clear. I also have a sony trv-20 digital camcorder so trust me I know what is a ($) dollars worth image looks like.2. also this camera cam with a mic which is also working nicely even better then my aiwa's mic came with my walk-man3. as a yahoo messenger user, this is a perfect fit. I spent a lot of time try to make my sony working on yahoo messenger... it didn't work. Let the ($) dollar webcam do its job, ok?final thought, if you don't need the attached mic, you can get the one without a mic for around ($) (exactly same thing just not voice.)"
3,As Advertised,Easy to install and a breeze to operate. The software works fine.For an entry level web cam it is a solid contender. If you are looking for crystal clear images and vivid color this is not the camera for you. You must spend allot more green stuff if you expect that kind of quality.Mr. Wally
5,Amazing!,"Love this film it had all the right elements to.make for great watching - humor, romance, heartbreak and mending. One of the best movies on dvd even today!"
3,One of Garland's Weaker 1940s Films,"Based on the oft-filmed ""Shop Around The Corner,"" most recently filmed as ""You've Got Mail,"" this particular film is long on charm and short on actual substance, relying almost completely upon Garland's sheer star power to carry it off-- which she does quite effectively, even when faced with a singularly undistinguished musical score and a throw-away script. Perhaps most memorable for the subplot played out by an excellent supporting cast than for anything else, the film will charm Garland fans but probably leave most others cold."
2,A poor imitation.,"As much as I admire Judy Garland, I'm afraid that this film can't hold a candle to the superb romantic comedy THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, from which it borrows its plot. The main defect is that Garland and Johnson are so overpowering in their detestation of each other that it is completely unbelievable for them to then suddenly realize that they are in love. There is no transition, no preparation for the abrupt reversal. Nobody can outdo Judy when she turns on the scorn and vituperation, and she just overdoes it to an irrevocable degree.Also the music doesn't amount to much. Now if you want to see an excellent musical version of the SHOP AROUND THE CORNER plot, find a stage performance of SHE LOVES ME, one of the most delightful musicals ever created."
4,good musical,"lot of good songs--enjoyed it very much--can't beat Liza singing ""Have Yourself a Merry Christmas"""
5,A GREAT CHRISTMAS FILM,"Despite the title , this movie is really a Christmas film. Everything in this film seems to work. The beautiful sets and costumes, the music, and even the falling snow. The story is not complicated ,but doesnt need to be. This is the kind of movie that you just want to lay back and forget your troubles and just enjoy. Of course the magic of Garland is the highlight of the film. Although this movie is not as famous as ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" it is still a great holiday film that brings me joy every Christmas............"
4,Classic Delight,"This is my favorite Judy Garland movie. The DVD is a faithful reproduction of the movie and has, as expected, a pictorial clarity unheard of in the movie era. The flawless reproduction is tarnished, however, in a scene near the end of the movie. In the scene, the lights are low and were corrected to present reality. They were rendered so dark that the stars, Van Johnson and Judy Garland, were nothing more than silhouettes on the screen. From the tape version of the movie, this scene was one of Judy's most hilarious scenes, attributed to the expressions she delivered in response to Mr. Johnson's advances, both of which were unseen in the black. The DVD is worth watching, but, for students of Judy Garland's talents, a tape version clarifies the omissions of the DVD."
2,Why send to U.S. with Korean subtitles?,"The DVD seems to be fine. However, my 100 year old mother is the person using it, and she has difficulty turning off the Korean subtitles, which are very distracting to her, every time she plays it."
4,A funny film that deserves to be credited,"In the contest of films about romantic pen pals, ""In the Good Old Summertime"" takes a firm second place to ""You've got Mail"" (no offense to Jimmy Stewart, who is always more touching than he is funny). Many aspects of this film are top-notch. This version has a very ample share of great acting (besides Judy). One notable is S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall, who is a gem of a supporting actor, as the lovable but irritable boss. Keaton is also very cute (despite being a supporting player). The songs are wonderful, especially ""Play that Barbershop Chord"" and ""Merry Christmas"". Another important point about this film is about how the two fall in love. The only problem (in the entire film, for that matter) is that Van Johnson falls in love too quickly, lessening his credibility. Judy's character, at least, doesn't make that mistake."
3,In The Good Old Summertime,One of my favorite movies and now I can see it as much as I want. The actors in this movie were great and some of my favorites also.The movie was a newer twist on the older movie Shop Around The Corner which I loved.
3,Gift for a friend,I ordered this as a gift for a friend. I personally do not like musicals. She apparently has no taste.
5,Great Classic,"This is the remake of 'Shop Around the Corner' preceding the remake 'You've Got Mail.' All three are great movies. This particular movie is my favorite of the three. Cute, feel good love story that anyone, young and old, can enjoy watching. The story never gets old. Who doesn't love a fantastic black and white film? It's a great classic to add to your collection."
5,In The Good Old Summertime,This movie is full of hope. Comfortable old town shop with lovable characters. Great songs and a happy ending. A feel good movie.
5,In the Good Old Summertime,I really enjoyed watching this movie. I am a very big fan of old movies and Judy Garland.
4,Nice Addition,Ordered these to compliment the front set. It was not clear in the description but note that this not a set. They are more flimsy than the ones for the front but we rarely have passengers in the year so can't comment on how well they stay in place. Like I said they complete the set but I wouldn't count on them for stability only curb appeal.
5,Excellent Technical Book on Windows 98!,"This is a great book. The author very clearly explains each topic in a consise, correct, and clear manner. He walks you through even the most difficult of ""undocumented"" features of Win98, even when you need to make changes to the Registry. Great book for all users; be they introductory all the way thru to the most advanced Win98 system administrators. This is the book that Microsoft should have written themselves!"
5,Gender Changer Thin HD15 F/F VGA,"The Gender Changer, Thin, HD15 F/F VGA was extremely helpful in setting up my gaming console I used it to connect to VGA cables one from my Xbox 360 and another from my HD Color Display computer monitor. The gender changer allowed me to play Xbox 360 games on a computer monitor with better resolution and picture than on a television making it the key component to an amazing gaming experience."
2,"Unless You're From Bangladesh, Don't Waste Your Money","Great book if you're an ESL student. For writers and research, though, it sucks (author's term). If there's an American out there who doesn't know EVERYTHING in this book by the time they've reached 18, they're either in a convent or heavily drugged."
5,Good Product,Seems to be a good product so far. I've had it for a couple few months and it has held up fine in the rain.Very easy to install and I would recommend this product.
2,*Lots* of errors in this book!,"While there is some good, general, obvious content about planning family travel, there are exentensive factual errors about the actual destinations--stuff that could have easily been verified on the Internet or with a comprehensive travel book. Really sloppy stuff.Use this to help you plan if you need it, but *not* to research."
3,"Good info, hard read","This book is chock-full of vital information on the subject. The issue is that it is not an easy read. The words are small and it seems as if the info just goes on and on and on with no page breaks or chapter reviews often. But because of the good content, I've decided to keep the book instead of selling it back."
2,Too disorganized,"Like some other reviewers have already noted, this textbook is way too detailed and too disorganized. The author jumps from one topic to another, from one stage of development to another, without tying the loose ends together to form a coherent thought. Basically, the book reads like somebody trying to get out all of his/her knowledge of children's language development with no concern for organization. The reader is left with the unsavory task of having to reorganize the text into something comprehensible, and this is a very difficult endeavor that takes too much time. I do not recommend this book at all and urge you to find something else."
4,Finally it was delivered to me,The item was late however it was in the condition stated so I was satisfied. Now the book itself is good so far and is helping me in my studies
2,Stereotypes are not evidence.,"I don't have too much to say about this book, but I felt compelled to point out some things that have irked me while reading it.While the book is very detailed and full of relevant information the author has included some blatantly stereotypical and offensive examples when talking about differences in culture. An example is on page 132, the last paragraph on the page: The author refers to the ""Asian style"" of communicating as ""more reticent and respectful"". He does not even provide data for these generalizations! This reminds me of Orientalist thinking.Furthermore if this is the 8th edition, I would expect not to read that Arabic is an Indo-European language (page 96, 5th paragraph down). It is not. Arabic is a Semitic language like Hebrew and Tigrinya."
2,Gross,This book has so much water damage that I didn't even want to touch it when I opened the box. I really just wanted to send it right back and get my money back. My teacher saw the book and could not believe that I paid over $70 for the book.
4,"Grandma, What a Teenager!","Yikes, Grandma's a Teenager is a wonderful book. At first, Zack's grandma is tired, just wants her coffee, and goes to bed early. But then because of a crystal bracelet, she turns into a teenager. She buys strange clothes and jokes about getting her nose pierced. Zack thinks it is cool, but Zack's dad is really freaked out about it. I think grandmas will like this book. You might want to read it to your grandma --- I did!"
4,"good one, but not that small","it is not as thin as the sony one, but the effect is nice. I like the color and the shipment is quick!"
3,not exactly what I wanted,"My husband helped select this mouse for me, so of course it was more of what he was interested in than what I would have picked. We have a corded rollerball mouse on our other computer that I love and thought it would be similar. I wasn't thrilled with the thumb control, not like the other one, so I gave it to my husband for work (he thought the bells and whistles were cool anyway). It did take him a while to get used to it, and he had to modify the controls to slow it down, but he said it's okay. I went ahead and ordered another roller ball mouse. It's corded but that's okay. The cordless one has a long receiver cord that is the same thing, but has to be placed specifically, and now I don't have that hassle. The rollerball does all the moving, not the mouse, so I don't have to move it around."
2,cordless trouble,"For some this may be an ok product, but I have three problems with it:1. My keyboard and trackball are on a metal keyboard tray. Because of this, the wireless signal does not work reliably if the trackball is more than 4 inches or so from the receiver.2. Sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, the trackball just goes crazy and starts scrolling and clicking all over. This can be ... dangerous. I don't know if this is related to (1) or not.3. There is a lack of precision in movement of the ball for fine motion, and the ball doesn't always move smoothly but sticks sometimes. Previous trackballs I have owned have not had this problem.The size and shape are nice, but these problems make it a real pain. If I were to buy this again, I would definitely buy the corded version. Cordless operation just isn't worth the hassles when it doesn't work right."
5,"Freedom, Performance,and Quality","If you have a desktop area that is limited for space, and you're looking for the freedom that a cordless device can offer, then this Logitech Cordless Trackman Wheel is for you. Your thumb is used to effortlessly move the Trackball as your fingers operate the right and left buttons much like a standard mouse, a feature that I personally prefer over a fingertip controlled trackball. The wheel is also an great tool for scrolling and can be programed as a third button. Finally you're also getting the quality and experience that the Logitech name has come to represent."
3,Carpal Tunnel support mouse,This mouse was suggested by an IT support manager. It has helped my thumb issues but it does not have an even flow to the track ball. It took a while to get used to and the clicking portion of the mouse is not intuitive. I have to only give it 3 stars because newer ones have come out that seem better. Go use one at Best Buy to get the feel before buying. The price seemed high considering how many choices there are.
4,Love My Mouse,I love my wireless trackball!!! It frees up my desk from yet another cord. It's easy to use and I don't get a cramped up hand.Also the speed in which I received it from Amazon was amazing.A very good experience all around.
1,My cordless experience,"I would like to say my experience has not been a good one. I bought this cordless mouse so I wouldn't have cords running across my living room. I have my computer running through the TV,and I sit I about 6 feet from the screen. I have the same corded model, and thought this would be pretty much the same just no cords. Everyday I have a problem trying to get the thing to work. Either the battery wasn't good enough, or the sun coming through the window will mess with the signal. The thing will start sticking and the pointer won't move or something hindering the operation. I even had the receiver about two feet from my chair (cords on the floor) and still the same. I love the logitech corded mouse, but the cordless is not worth the heartache. I would like to say as far as the company that sent this to me goes, they did their part and the packaging was great. I would recommend them but just not this cordless mouse."
2,Horrible Connection!,"We've had the wired version of this mouse (x2) for the last 2-6 years and were hoping that the wireless version would decrease the cord mess in the living room with the HTPC setup. Wrong! It will not keep a consistent connection even when 3ft from its receiver (product literature says up to 6ft). It either does not work at all or it shakes and glitches on the screen. It went straight back to Amazon. Amazon's service was great though, easy return. We're trying the Iogear HTPC keyboard, hoping that works (30ft range and 4/5 stars per Amazon)."
3,Great track ball with a limited two year life span,"These work great for as long as they last.The transmitter that plugs into the computer USB port always fails after 1 1/2 to 2 years of service. If they lasted longer, I would have given it a five star rating.I've had three of these things over the years because they are so comfortable and ergonomic. Wish Logitech would sell replacement transmitters so I didn't have to buy a complete new product every two years."
3,Decent Trackball Mouse with a Few Drawbacks,"My wrists have been bothering me and I was told this was a good way to go. Fairly easy to set up. The receiver is large and has poor range. I thought I could get much further away then two feet without seeing performance issues. It doesn't seem to matter where I place the receiver, it just doesn't like my mouse getting too far away. I have a large hand and it would be nice if there was more area on the mouse for my palm to rest comfortably on. Have been using it for several days and wrists seem to be less irritable. If I had to choose again I would go with the cheaper wired version."
4,Review if Logitech Wireless Rollerball Mouse,"It is the first ""roller-ball"" mouse I have ever purchased and it did take a little getting use to as it different from another mouse. but I would recommendit. However, the range, since it is wireless was a little disappointing. Since I am at a split level computer desk, I have to keep the receiver on the upper level fairly close if I want the mouse to stay response. I would not suggest it for easy portability for say a lap top as hauling the reciever around with it could be a bit cumbersome."
3,Short battery life,I got this product and i was all excited about getting it. The convenience of being a distance away from the computer and being able to use the mouse was great. After a few months it began to drain the batteries very quickly within 2 days. I tried changing batteries- rechargeable and alkaline- both with same disappointing results. Unfortunately i had to dispose of it. Got a corded one instead and it works like a charm.
4,Works great.,"Logitech did great with this unit. The only thing I would change is the base unit wireless transmitter. It is still the older, larger model and is too large. It needs to be a flash drive type of thing, not such a large piece with a wire.Mouse works great!"
1,Carpal Tunnel,"I've been using traditional optical mouse devices. But due to small desk space, I wanted to try trackball devices. The idea was that trackball device stays in one place so I wouldn't need much desk space. I got the Logitech Cordless Trackman and man am I ready to go back to good old mouse devices!!Cons:- After a day's use I am feeling pain in my thumb, and fore arm. Classic Carpal Tunnel symptoms!- While the trackball is quick in movements, it is difficult to work with when you need to be very precise. So clicking on small buttons requires multiple attempts.- Click 'n drag / Drag 'n drop actions are quite tricky. Not as intuitive as with traditional mouse devices.- The device comes with a sensor that is huge. Almost the size of a mouse itself. As I said, I wanted to reduce the space required on my desk, and I ended up having gained very little!Pros:- It's a large device. Good for people with large hands. Provides a lot of support.- Easy connectivity. I'm using Windows XP. Plug 'n play!"
3,Jittery for use with Mac,"When it works, it works well. Unfortunately the performance with my MacBook Pro is intermittent and quite jittery. I love the trackman wheel mice and have gone through a few of them over the years. Therefore I am used to the trackman design and if I can't get the wireless Trackman to play better with my Mac, I might have to go back to the wired version. I would love to hear any tips on how you've made this mouse work well with your Mac."
3,Could use a little improvment,Have had the corded version of this item for ever multiple of them and love it!! Was hoping for a good travel version of this item with less cord :( not exactly what we expected. The usb connection has a fair amount of cord and a large receiver.. was hoping more for just a small usb connector and no wire -- other then that it works as well as the corded version. Will hope for better connections in the future.
3,Good Track Ball,"The only thing I did not like about this product was the LARGE attachment of the USB antenna. I wanted it to use with a laptop, and it took up more space than the wired model."
4,arthritic hand pain,Use of the Logitech cordless Trackman wheel has lessened the pain I was having in my right hand. I bought it because my doctor suggested I try one. I have found it has taken time to get used to it and I'm still learning. I hope to get better as I found I can't play computer solataire as fast as with a regular mouse.
4,Logitech Review,"The logitech cordless trackman is easy to use, It would be nice if it a way to control its sensitivity, otherwise it's great"
4,Very happy with this purchase,"I got this mouse primarily because I was getting tendonitis in my mouse hand. By the end of the day I had to spend 1 minute flexing and massaging my hand for every 2 minutes of mouse work. This has resolved that problem. I don't get any of the stiffness and soreness I get from a regular mouse. However, I have had to sacrifice precision. When you need to be precise and quick with the mouse pointer this mouse can be somewhat clumsy to work with. For this reason I have to keep my regular mouse hooked up as well, but it's a small concession to make for the overall benefit of this mouse. Also, I've noticed that the ball is starting to stick so it's essential that you keep it very clean. I imagine alcohol wipes will work fine for this."
3,Receiver too big.,After being a trackball user for many years I could not get used to using a standard mouse with my new laptop.When I saw that a wireless trackball was available I ordered it.I made the mistake of assuming the USB reciever would be the typical flash drive size. No Way. The reciever is a piece of machinery the size of the mouse itself on the end of a six foot cord. Very clunky to use with a laptop. Would be fine with a desk unit.No where on the Logitech site was the size of the receiver shown. Bad on me.Of course the trackball works fine. No complaints there.10/4/12 This unit was replaced with the M570 wireless trackball with mini reciever. GREAT!
2,thumb action is awkward,"I love trackballs, and tried the corded version of this one because my hand fit it well. But I found that I cannot get used to having the trackball under my thumb -- it's excruciatingly awkward. Obviously YMMV -- many reviewers here like it.Plus having used Kensington trackballs for a long time, I find that this ball is too small and does not roll as smoothly as I'm accustomed to. Unfortunately Kensington's current main model has other problems, which I've reviewed there. And the new Logitech which has the ball in the right place only comes cordless, which I'd rather not have to deal with.Edward-- I see the brevity of truth. --"
2,"Good design, but sluggish response","I am a fan of the design of the Trackman Wheel, but the cordless version is quite a bit less responsive than the corded version -- the cursor does not track the motion of the trackball as precisely with the cordless version when compared to the corded.Were I running it through the PS/2 interface, I would be checking whether the refresh rate had been set too low. The sluggishness has that kind of feel.If you like the design -- I do -- stick with the corded version if precision of response is important to you. A gamer would notice the difference immediately. Others may not be as easily annoyed."
1,Not Designed for Laptops,"This product is not designed to be convenient with laptops. The ""hub"" that allows the computer to talk to the trackball is a good sized gadget with quite the chord of it's own. I'd say this would work great for a desktop, but if I were at a desk, the trackball never needs to move anyway, eliminating the need for cordless."
4,pretty darn good,"First, what's this trackball doing under the mice category?This trackball is so comfortable it's like it becomes part of my hand. The thumb control has taken some getting used to since I just switched from a finger controlled one, but I'm getting along fine. My opinion is finger ones are a little easier to control, but thumb ones tend to be more comfortable in the hand. And I love not having the extra cord on my desk.If anyone has gotten annoyed at the pointer not tracking well during sudden movements, just download the most recent driver from the logitech website. The enclosed version can't handle sudden movements when the acceleration feature is used, causing the pointer to stutter. This is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. But it's an easy fix and now I love it even more."
1,This product is NOT cordless!,"They say this is a cordless trackman, but this is NOT A CORDLESS PRODUCT. There is a 4 foot cord on the receiver. And the receiver is huge. It is time for a receiver to be the same as a jump drive - no cord and small. This receiver and cord is a real big nuisance. It is constantly getting tangled with the laptop power cord and the cat 5 cable.Since every ad hides the fact this product has a corded receiver like this - I'm not sure how you can shop for one that doesn't have a long cord and big receiver online. Seems that is where going to a store excels - when online selling is not forthcoming about the product."
1,This product is being discontinued by manufacturer,"This product does not work with Mac OS 1.4.7 and above, though there is no indication of this in the literature. Logitec tells me that it is discontinuing the item, and will not update the software. BE AWARE OF THIS!!!"
2,Unexpected and annoying,"Do not get this if you have a laptop. I got this mouse instead of a regular mouse specifically because of my laptop (you can't move a mouse around unless you have a flat surface) and I should've just gotten the non-wireless, $9 cheaper one. The connector is HUGE, and the cord on it is long. It would've been easier to just have a mouse with a cord, because that's less parts to worry about. They don't mention it anywhere, and it's not in any pictures. Terrible mouse."
4,Logitech does the job,"Got this mouse for my Husband's new computer because he had a similar one that finally died. This isn't the one I use, but it's easy enough and he loves it.One thing that can be said for Logitech. They give you a great warranty, five years on these products I think, and IF anything goes wrong they honor it immediately. They are great to deal with."
5,Best Mouse Ever,"Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel is comfortable for my hand and very easy to use once you get accustomed to it's ball feature. It's the only mouse I'll buy. My kids love it, too."
2,Shape is not as comfortable,"I used the original trackman and trackman with trackball for years and love them. Unfortunately, the newer version shape is much more raised and hurts the palm of the hand after an hour or so of use. I've gone back to the original one with the annoying cord."
1,cordless mouse should be in mouse trap,This is the second cordless mouse I have purchased. Same brand and model. Now this one doesn't work. Second time. No more.
2,Just couldn't get used to it.,"I've been using a standard mouse since they were invented. I thought I would try the trackman and found the learning curve too steep. I simply couldn't get used to it. Furthermore, I found my thumb beginning to hurt, almost like the early stages of carpal tunnel. I'm sure this is a great product, and maybe I'm just too old to be taught new tricks. Just remember, it's not like using a standard mouse."
1,DOESN'T WORK WITH WINDOWS 7!!!,"WARNING!!! It does't work with Windows 7!That's it, just a warning for those using that OS."
1,Logitech Cordless Trackman Wheel,"This is not a great product. Not pictured is the cord which is required; the rather large radio receiver plugs into PS/2 or USB port via a cord. The wireless ability is from the receiver to the trackball. This is a product for desktops only. Logitech needs to get a clue from Kensington which makes truly cordless mice for laptops which have a simple USB plug-in receiver; however Kensington only makes mice, no trackballs available."
4,The most comfortable mouse.,"I've been using the Logitech TrackMan for years. To me it's very comfortable and fast. My hand naturally falls into position on this unit. Years ago I used the corded version and that did work smoother than the cordless model. The cordless model is just more convenient for my laptop. I just bought my 3rd cordless TrackMan after my other ones finally wore out. Using the ball is very smooth and accurate for games as well as everyday computer use. The only drawback is as others mentioned, the corded transmitter. It's large and bulky and just one more cord hanging off the back of my laptop."
5,Just like the hard wired version... But no cord,"I find this to be just as comfortable and useful as the model with the cord, but being wireless, I can use it from my sofa while watching the computer on my big screen TV.While some folks don't like Trackballs (I think more due to their lack of familiarity than anything else), I think they are great. Fully as fine a control as using a conventional mouse, but without the arm motion or extra desk space required for mousing.Amazon's delivery was a little slower than I would have liked. (Of course I wanted it the day before I even ordered it.) But the price was reasonable and Amazon carried it, which a certain unnamed, but big office supply store doesn't."
4,Best mouse I have ever used,"I do a lot of work on my computer. I do graphic design as well as network administration and various other things. I have had issues with carpal tunnel type issues on standard mice. This mouse is the best thing I have ever found. I have used mine for 3+ years. It is comfortable, easy, smooth, and accurate. Once you are used to not moving your hand, it is a breeze and is crucially useful in dual monitor set ups (trying moving your hand on a standard mouse across two screens without picking it up).Last year I got a Macbook Pro and have been using a mighty mouse and although for a mouse it is good, it is painfully obvious that I miss my trackman when using it. It is so apparent that I just bought a cordless version for that laptop specifically. It is a large body mouse as some have noted, which can be annoying physically, but it is so good at what it does I don't notice. It is great ergonomically and I have not had one pain since using it."
4,"Best trackball out there, though need for laser arises.","This is a really great trackball. I have used the original PS/2 version, then got a USB and now went wireless for work. Works quite well.However, I think it's time for Logitech to create a similar one to use laser for better precision. At times it feels like the movement is not 100% accurate (as if there is a slight lag in movement). Not really noticeable though unless you have used a laser mouse before (very smooth movement).This is definitely a lot more comfortable than most trackballs I have used."
3,It's ok....,It's an ok mouse. It would have been better had it been like the Logitech Revolution rechargable mouse and have a charger and not have to use batteries. The wireless node is a lil large but not too terribly large that it's unusable.
4,"Ergonomic, Yes","I purchased this product upon a recommendation from an ergonomic evaluation. This really did help the arthritis pain and numbness that I was experiencing. It is a little awkward at first since your thumb is the primary driver, but well worth the effort to make it work.If you are a heavy mouser, I highly recommend it to eliminate pain and numbness."
4,Cordless Trackman,"I own two corded Logitch Trackman Wheel devices and I am very happy with them. Consequently I had high hopes for the cordless version. The shape was the same as my other units and I was pleased by the movement and responsiveness of the ball. Unfortunately the two click buttons were a bit stiff and this activated my latent tendonitis. This necessitated the return of the unit. I contemplated requesting a replacement but in the meantime I was able to work out a corded solution that worked fine.I would still recommend the Trackman. I don't like using any other type of device at this point. It was probably my particular unit that was at fault and not the design since I am still using the corded variety. Also, for someone else, without my particular tendon issues, the unit might possibly have been fine."
3,"Great same track ball as wired, but short range wireless hurts",I have used the wired logitech version of this for 6 years and love it...this one is ergonomically the same and performs well but you have to have the usb reciever aligned towards you and with nothing blocking it. The cable is a little too short to do this adequately and I subsequently have eratic mouse movements as close as three feet away. I find myself not using the this mouse anymore in favor of my on board touch pad on my microsoft 7000 keyboard because it has better range.
5,Extremely pleased!,"""I love the way the Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel keeps my hand and wrist in place...something my standard mouse did not do. Consequently, no more pain after using for long periods of time. I can heartily recommend this product."" This comment is from my wife after buying my second Cordless TrackMan Wheel for her. If she is pleased, I am pleased."
4,Good,"I was looking for a portable mouse to accompany my new laptop. My boyfriend talked me in to this one because he loves trackballs. Unfortunately it's a bit on the big side and the receiver has to be plugged in, has a 2-3 ft cord, and has to be at least about a foot away from the laptop to function well. It will work, but I wish it had one of those flash-drive-size receivers instead!"
4,Perfect if only a little larger,"Set up was simple. I did have to follow the directions to get it installed however. I know that sounds strange but I thought it would be just a plug in and go thing. Trackball movement is smooth. I only wish there were a larger area for resting my hand. I had a Microsoft trackball for a number of years that fit my entire hand. If this is your first trackball, the size probably won't be an issue. I would buy it again in a heartbeat."
2,Kinda iffy...,It worked fine for the first 6 weeks or so then started acting up. The left button periodically sticks for no apparent reason -- I have to strike it sharply several times when that happens to get it to free up. I disassembled it but could find no mechanical defect so it's behavior is a complete mystery.
3,I've had better,"This ""cordless"" trackman wheel isn't cordless at all! The unit requires the user to plug a transmitter into the computer via USB. This would probably be fine for a desktop computer user but if you are mobile with a laptop it is pointless. The receiver has a cord on it about 2 feet long so my opinion is if you are using this unit you might as well be using a corded track unit and save yourself $15-20. I enjoyed the scroll wheel but the unit's pointer movement was a bit jumpy."
5,Cordless Track Ball Purchase,"Logitech Track Ball was easy to install and a breeze to use. Great ergonomic layout that eliminates need for mouse pad. Would recommend to anyone. *****Purchased directly from Amazon. Best price, delivered as promised. *****"
5,Logitech Cordless Trackman,"I love this device. I bought the first one 5 years ago and am using it on my Desktop. I have grown so dependant on it, when I bought a laptop I decided to purchase a second one because it is so comfortable to use. It has been very reliable and I highly reccomend it to anyone."
4,"If you use a trackball, this is nice","I've used trackballs ever since I've used computers, 17 years now. I've had this one for probably five or six years and it still works like new. The plastic where my palm rests is discolored green from years of sweat, oil, dirt, etc, but it feels fine. The rubber feet on the bottom don't stand up well though. One is gone, another I glued on and is extremely deteriorated, and the last one is wearing down. But other than those aesthetic issues, as long as you clean the little white dots inside, it works great. If it breaks, I'll buy another right away."
5,The best,"Throw away your mouse, get a track ball. No cords, no pads and extremely good software. Everyone who comes over and uses one of my track balls wants one and this is the ultimate. I have had these units for over 11 years with no failures. They are as dependable as rocks."
5,Works great but...,"We have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer. It works just as well as the corded one when I'm in my office. For travel, the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel. It's not a small, USB stick that goes in the back. It's a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan. I don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel. All that said, I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me."
5,Logitech Rules,I found this to be best. It has a easy setup and the fit on my hand is out of this world.I will tell all my friends and family about this one.
2,Terrible design - battery compartment,"Thank goodness for Amazon return policy. Got the TrackMan; after twenty minutes of work, still unable to pry open the compartment to put the battery in. Back to Amazon and a prompt refund. Might be a nice product if I could have gotten the battery in!"
5,Love my cordless trackman wheel,I have been using one for years. I wouldn't have nothing else but this. Very easy to use. Don't have to move it every so often. Cursor moves from one side of the screen to the other with very little movement of the ball.
2,Hard to switch to from a standard mouse,"I bought this specifically to play Elf Bowling. It didn't help me. It's too hard for me to adjust to using the correct fingers. I ended up buying an ergo stick mouse. Love it, but took 3 weeks to break in."
4,Ok but not great,"I've had this product for almost a years, so I have had plenty of time to evaluate it. For the most part it is a great trackball, but my only complaint is that the batteries seem to run down quickly and then is gets jumpy."
3,Small hands,My thumb has to stretch a little too much when using this unit and so it's not comfortable for extended periods of time. I guess it's b/c I have a smaller-than-average sized hand (ring size 5). I'll have to find better mouse alternative than this one.
4,Best Trackball I've Owned...,"Good. Nice trackball, with good wireless range. Far far better than a Kensington one which I used before this. Accurate, and easy to use. Highly recommended. BTW, I use this with a HTPC connected to a LCD TV, so that there aren't cables aplenty running across the living room. It serves this purpose very well, together with a wireless keyboard of course!"
2,What good is wireless,You need to be within four inches of the receiver in order for the mouse to function and even then its choppy and not at all smooth I had one of these a few years back and I loved it but I can't recommend this one.
4,Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel,"One of the best products there is apart from lack of product development. I would like some more buttons like those on more modern Logitech mice such as sideways scroll and navigation on websites. Otherwise it's ergonomy is flawless and helps me continue to work with computers, ordinary mice gives me excruciating pain after a time."
2,Get Corded Version,"I much prefer the corded version of this trackball. It is otherwise identical in use and you never have to worry about the battery going out when you most need it. Because a trackball mouse remains stationary during use, there is no real reason that a cordless version is better. For heavy graphic applications, i.e., those for which trackballs are ideally suited, batteries can wear out rather often and always when you are on a tight schedule."
4,Easy on my wrist,"I've been using this trackball for about 6 years. It's a great product. I tend to ruin the chords after 2-3 years and have to purchase a replacement. My only complaint about this Trackball, and this is extremely irritating for me, is that Logitech has not changed the wireless receiver that attaches to the computer. Everyone is using tiny little USB receivers, as is Logitech for most of their wireless products. Yet this trackball has this stupid receiver that's about the size of a cookie, attached to a 5ft chord. I love this trackball, but if a competitor comes out with a similar Thumb driven trackball with a small receiver, I'll switch in a heartbeat."
1,don't expect long life,I've owned 3 of these and none of them lasted more than 5 months. Thankfully Logitech put a 5 yearwarranty on them. Prepare yourself to be constantly sending yours back to get a new one ever fewmonths.
5,Wireless is great!,I have been a Trackman user for a few years now and couldn't go back to a regular mouse. I bought this wireless Trackman a month ago and found wireless is even better. No more wire to keep me sitting close to my computer desk.
4,A nice basic keyboard,"When I ordered ths keyboard, I wasn't expecting much. However, Logitech delivered a nice product, with a modern, streamlined design. The keys are tactile, yet quiet while typing. If you need a cheap replacement to a keyboard, this might be the one.The only reason I gave this keyboard a 4 was, while taking off the wrist guard, one of the tabs broke off. Sad, I had only owned it for 6 hours when it happened."
5,No Complaints - Great Value,"I bought this keyboard b/c the keys are very quiet - this means I won't wake up the roommates when I'm typing late at night.The three quick-launch buttons work well and provide convenience - other than that, the keyboard is rather plain but wins first prize in the ""best bargain"" category.Some reviewers mentioned they had trouble taking the wrist guard on and off. I had no trouble - the trick is to squeeze the connecting tabs as you remove the wrist guard. It's like opening a child-proof pill container."
5,I Love This Keyboard!!!,This keyboard is very comfortable to use. The e-mail and homepage keys are so easy to set up. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a keyboard.
2,"Unfortunately more of a ""Self Promo"" than a Documentary.","The beginning portion of the film is by far the better portion and more aligned with learning about traditional Type practices. Even so, the first portion's view of Type and its history is very limited. Only focusing on one particular town in all the country struggling to keep their local typesetting museum alive. The main point of the film is to create an appreciation of the history and the lost craft through technology. The issue is the film never expands beyond this small minor town except for a trip to Chicago where the documentary turns into a self promotion for the creator's local designers/friends and Chicago's Renegade Craft Fair.Films I would recommend before this is Helvetica, and Art & Copy among others. Those films are focused on the subject matter they are titled after and reveal a full view of the subjects and their contemprary standings. This film seems to try to replicate Helvetica stylistically."
2,Kenny Vance Doo Wop Era,I purchased this DVD after seeing Kenny Vance in a concert. I was disappointed in the DVD though because it is mostly slow music. His concert was upbeat and fun and I thought that the DVD would be the same. It is music to put you to sleep!
1,Soundtrack to the Doo Wop Era Kenny Vance Collection,I hated this CD. I really expected more. The songs all sound alike.There was no feeling in any of the songs. If you hear them today theysing so much better. You hear emotion in the songs. This CD had none.
5,Long live doowop,"Great doowop by a great performer. Includes a beautiful rendition of The Way You Look Tonight, and, of course, Looking for an Echo."
4,Kenny Vance,I've been looking for a group playing oldies without sounding like Rockabillies and Kenny Vance delivers.
4,She loved it and its great but its smaller than what you see,"So she absolutely loved the watch which was the most important thing for me. I think its even of a good quality & build and so far its lasted 3 months and still looking as good as the first day I got it for her. Her friends even loved it and thought she was lucky to have a boyfriend to get her such a nice watch, at that point I must say I'm very happy with this. I really wanted her to love it and I think I hit the spot.I'm giving it a 4 not a 5 because I seriously thought that its a bigger watch, I know the dimensions are there but the picture is deceiving... in my opinion they used a macro lens to make it look larger, I know the dimensions are listed but still!! Anyway my gf is quite skinny so that didn't turn out to be a problem, it suited her well. For all you others just be aware of the size, thats my only negative point."
4,A must have,"If one purchases a Tascam 2488 they will find the manual lacks a lot. David Wills who narrates the video brings to light the ins and outs of home recording on the 2488. I'm very computer ignorant, but was able to start recording the second day after watching the DVD. Highly recommended."
5,Mystery solved,This DVD makes sense of the poorly written manual that accompanies the Tascam 2488 in all of it's incarnations. Removes so many questions that I can't imagine using the Tascam with out watching this video. Have watched it 3 times and always pick up something new.
4,Very Helpful,"I bought the Tascam 2488 NEO and wasn't getting the information I needed from the manual. It doesn't explain certain aspects of the unit thoroughly. Although there is a lot to learn about the unit, This DVD covers enough information to get you on your way to understanding the unit and producing great quality recordings. If you need more than what the product manual offers, I would highly recommend buying this DVD."
3,Tascam 2488 /MKII/NEO Tutorial,I was dissapointed with this tuturial really thinking it was gonna be a big help and wasnt :( I would love to get my money back !!
1,Not what it promises...,"I found this to be boring drivel, not at all what I had expected. The author doesn't make me like or appreciate any of the characters, and I didn't really care what happened. It's written quite amateurish, and I don't recommend the book at all."
1,A Literary Journey Beyond the Edge of Boredom,"This story of a girl from Kentucky and her Vietnam Vet Unclestarts off slowly and then steadily bogs down. Every page is chock full of some of the most uninteresting and familiar everyday details that modern American life has to offer.Example: ""Sam took an orange Popsicle out of the freezer compartment of the refrigerator. She broke it in two, then removed half from the paper and bit off the end. It was slightly mushy.""I could write more interesting observations about my dog sleeping. If you want really test the limits of your ability to resist being bored to death, this is the perfect book for you.I was proud that I was able to reach page 72 before giving up entirely."
1,Never understood the attraction,"I had the ""pleasure"" of hearing Ms. Mason speak prior to the filming of the movie In Country. She was far too reserved to be an engaging speaker, but the fact that a major motion picture was coming out and that the book was selected for reading at our local high school made me seek it out. What a disappointment. :P"
1,This book makes no sense!,"Bobbie Ann Mason creates characters with which most people cannot identify. This gives little insight (although it claims to give much) into the real Vietnam. It is dull with a horable plot and characters that are simple, uncouth, not dignified in any way, and devoid of any real depth. Why I was required to read this in a college course I will never know. It seems to be liken to the thickness and depth of Judy Blume but with a tone that indicates that it (and the author) takes itself (her work) way too seriously."
2,VERY BORING,"This book is pointless. The main character, Sam, is very childish. She is too busy worrying about everyone else's life around her and about the Vietman War to look ahead into the future. She wastes all her time trying to figure out what happened in the war and how her fater died. The whole book is about her quest to find out the gory details about Vietman. She even sleeps in a forest, pretending to be at war to reenact Vietnam. This book is very slow. I kept asking myself: Will Mason finally make some point? However, if you are fascinated by wars and lost someone close in a war then this book might be worth something to you."
1,Terrible absolutely terrible.,Man you know this duo is bad when the paperback book costs more than the DVD. They tried to make me read this pile of trash but i couldn''t even get passed the first page without falling asleep and wating to burn myself alive.
1,In Country,"In Country, how can I describe this book? In four words crappy piece of garbage; am so unfortunably forced to read this literature for school, and i've got too say, to give it two thumbs up you'll have to read it 8 times. I agree this book could be a very good book if they stood with the plot in part 1, but Tom,Sam, and Lonnies life story just isn't interesting. Look at their names, there too basic. Too tell you the truth Kentucky is boring, the books boring, and the author is boring. You have to drink coffee to read this book; the real downside is that the coffee will end up costing more than the book. My advise to all you readers is to jack the book from Barnes and Noble,Borders or photo copy it, save the money for the coffee because your gonna need it."
4,Also a movie,"I was fascinated by this book and couldn't put it down. It was a very easy read and made me think about a different war, besides Iraq or Afghanistan. It was interesting to see the role the media played in the book and to read more about Agent Orange. Not exactly extremly historical with a lot of mentions, but a good novel about how family relationships were affected by Vietnam."
3,A teenagers discoveries about Vietnam,"Sam is a girl who is torn between her mother and her uncle. Throughtout the book Sam makes a lot of discoveries about herself, her family, and about Vietnam. At the end, I believe that Sam made the right choices. Read this book to find out if you agree. This was a good book because many people can relate to Sam and her feeings. It wasn't the best book because it I'm not really interested inn War books."
2,It's Okay,"I thought this book was okay. It wasn't bad in the sense that you couldn't even read it, but I found it hard to get into. The main character, Sam, starts to spend all of her time obsessing over the Vietnam War, which her father was killed in. She hangs out with her uncle and all of his friends who are veterans and tries to connect with all of them and she struggles to understand the experiences that they had in Vietnam. That's really all I got out of this book. I don't think that Mason did a great job creating a teenager's voice. If you're really into books about Vietnam and warfare, then you might really like this book."
2,STARTINGLY WEAK,"I read this because it's short and well regarded. I was taken aback by how weak it is. It's not flawed, it's inept in story , characters, character development, pacing, everything. Wow. The endless burbling by shallow characters is what really sinks this one for me. Yikes. A little shocking. S.E. Hinton is eons more successful at this sort of thing."
3,Easy Read - A Bit Predictable,"If you are looking for a way to pleasantly pass an hour or two you could do worse than In Country. Interesting enough, but filled with too many stereotypical characters and predictable plot lines to be a truly stellar novel"
3,It's 1984 all over again,"It's hard for me to believe that a book written in 1985 is a period piece, but that's how I reacted to it. It seems so removed from today. Have we come so far in our dealing with the Vietnam War that a 14-year-old book seems dated? Have we finally welcomed the returning vets? Have we settled the issue of POWs and MIAs? Have we forgiven ourselves? This story was disturbing at times--Sam's ""wild"" life with her Uncle Emmett, her romance with Tom the vet, her father's war journal. If I had read this in 1985, I think I would have felt passionately about Sam's search to know her father. Instead I found myself reminiscing about M*A*S*H re-runs, Atari games, and Bruce Springsteen videos. These references made the story out-of-date, not timeless."
3,7 Nations has done better..,I don't feel covers have ever been this bands strong suit. A very original sound and great live shows have kept me coming back to them. Here things just don't seem to fit. If you are a huge 7N fan you may like this album. For most it sounds forced and uncomfortable.
5,Crossover Classical at it's best!,"I purchased this after listening to samples, never having heard of this ""group"" before. The vocals are stunning, the clarity of the music is absolutely top notch, and the variety of beats used to mix the aria's is refreshing. There is a good variety of music here, some with vocals, some without. Personal opinion: ""Ombra mai fu"" is so good, it warrants a purchase of this album, even if you don't find the rest of the songs so hot."
4,Something different - yet with a fresh approach...,"I'd have to agree with Iconophoric and his assessment of mr. Dilibertos' view of this CD. Mr. Diliberto should go get a real job.I first heard the original ARIA release in a Borders store back about 1997 or so. Loved what i heard from the beginning ( and i'm NOT an opera fan ), and immediately purchased it.In fact, while i was selling my house i would often play this CD while prospective buyers were touring the place ( on low volume ) - more often than not i'd hear ""...what is that beautiful music you're playing?...""Not sure if i helped sell more CDs or not, but it helped the mood of the prospective buyers.A couple of years later, i purchased the 2d ARIA CD - again - by hearing just one of the tracks.I haven't been disappointed and recommend these works to anyone who is willing to open their minds to something different with a fresh approach to something usually considered 'uggh'."
4,"Love Paul's stuff, this is wonderful - who drums on track 13???","I had long enjoyed State of Grace, and was recently turned on to Aria 3. Imagine the delight when I found out Paul Schwartz is the man behind both these projects! (Love the web and all the details I can get!) This album is wonderful, IMHO, great chill-out music. The 2 last bonus tracks are especially nice.I MUST know - please help here - who plays the drums on track 13??? Great drum track!I confidently recommend this, and State of Grace is worth checking out as well. Enjoy!"
4,Music to escape by,"Paul Schwartz is one of my favorite escape artists. I will usually listen to his Arias when I'm in ""one of those moods"". I'm still trying to figure out what that means but rather than listening for artistic merit, I listen for the dreamy escape - the mood transportation. Schwartz has his critics - most musicians do - but he cannot be faulted for offering music that is better, arguably, than costly psychotherapy."
5,Great Christmas gift!,I gave this as a Christmas gift after listening to the online samples. Volumes 1 and 2 are good but I liked this volume best. Has good punchy bass.
3,Episodes listed... ...small disappointment,"Alvin, Simon and Theodore set their sights on Hollywood with this trio of hilarious send-ups. First, Simon becomes the costumed crimefighter ""Batmunk"" and must foil the Jokester's (aka Alvin) evil plot to heist a large shipment of toys. Next, the boys boldly go where no chipmunk has gone before, in ""Star Wreck: The Absolutely Final Frontier."" Join Captain James T. Duck (Alvin), Mr. Speck (Simon), Moamz (Theodore), and the crew of the U.S.S. Booby Prize as they battle sinister aliens bent on galactic conformity. And, Dave and Miss Miller are accidentally shrunk after an unfortunate encounter with one of Simon's inventions, in ""Funny, We Shrunk the Adults."" Wish they would have included ""Daytona Jones"" and ""Robomunk"" instead of ""Funny, We Shrunk the Adults."" However, the episode selection didn't stop me from pre-ordering."
5,He likes it.,"My cat likes the toy. He rolls onto it, hugs it, kicks it, and chews on its face and tail. He probably plays with it more when I am not watching or home, but I've seen him play several times. It is long, but fairly skinny, which makes it harder for my fat cat to kick it. Nice, well-made toy."
4,My cat didn't really respond to it,This toy didn't really do anything for my cat. However my cat is one of those cats that doesn't even care about lazer pointers.
5,Perfect Toy for Cats,This cat toy is perfect for cats. My cat instantly played with it when I gave it to him. He was even licking it! It's organic and has a nice smell. I would recommend this toy to anyone.
3,Were not interested!,"They really jumped on it first but when they licked all the catnip smell off.....that was it! I think it's another toy that's just too big for cats. They like toys they can carry around in their mouths as they pretend it's prey that they have caught! So.....toy makers.....listen up!!! As always, with Amazon.......it's packed well and delivery is quick!"
4,Cats love it!,My cats were all over these as soon as I opened the box and they continue to enjoy them a month later. Will definitely purchase again when the current set is worn out.
1,MISREPRESENTATION!!!,"This cat toy is advertised as 11 inches long. I measured mine and it is only 9 1/2 inches long! I am tired of purchasing items here that are described as one thing and when they get to me, they are NOT the same item as described, so obviously this is not the first time this has happened to me here. I am tired of buying items that are misrepresented here and will have to shop at places that send you the actual item you ordered and paid for!"
5,I'm happy to have a Pollock on my floor!,"My cat doesn't care about art but he sure loves this Fish. He was a stray that we took in and he's a ruff-neck that kicks this toy up. It holds up very well to the beating and the aroma lasts a long time also. He entertains himself for an hour with this and he's one that gets bored easily. IMO, it is definitely worth the money. The bananas are good also but not quite as long, the cigars work but because of the color, we're constantly stepping on them and freaking ourselves out."
3,Fish Toy,"Was not appreciated as much as the smaller fish and the banana.It is used infrequently, also is too heavy to pick up and fling."
5,Catnip plus!,"This is a VERY LARGE catnip fish. A couple of my cats enjoy bunny kicking it and the other two just ignore it. It seems very well put together - is holding up to the claws and bunny kicking without developing holes in the fabric or seams. One of my cats (a large male) lines himself up and lays down on it so it is completely covered by his body and then almost seems to be daring the other cats to try to get it away. What he doesn't seem to realize is that I have two of these and he can't guard them both so there are no fights over it. If your cats like catnip and like large toys, this is probably a good fit."
3,"Yeowww Pollock Fish Catnip Toy, 11-Inch","My 2 cats loved playing with this toy when I gave it to them, but they chewed a hole in it withing minutes."
5,The Best Hitorical record of the F-111 yet!,"I have been associated with the F-111 since Jan 1970 both as a crew member and a civilian instructor. I am Also the high time USAF F-111 instructor weapons systems oficer, with 2500 hours. This book covers the aircraft in more detail than any I have yet seen and my collection of F-111 books is extensive. I have books that have been sent to me from people in Japan, United Kingdom, Australia and all over Europe and this exceeds them all. Out of 129 F-111A's I have flown 95 of them and out of 94 F-111E's I have flown 76 of them, so I feel sure of myself when I rate this book 5 plus stars and tell you it brings back many memories. Major Wm H. Hamilton, USAF, Ret."
3,a well-written and informative book..,"this a great book about the vark..unfortunately like his previous book, Republic's A-10 Thunderbolt II : A Pictorial History, Don Logan included too many picture of F-111 on the ground.Almost 90% pictures depicted F-111 on the ground with a side view.This make the picture looks like a repetiton.It make the vark looks like a statue rather than a predator in the sky. Nevertheless this book is a good reference for the F-111 enthuasist and fan."
2,Didn't work for us,I bought this toy thinking that my daughter would enjoy it because of the bright colored balls that trickle down the hammer and the fact that she likes to swing toys and bang on things. But she never really took to it. She has more fun with my cooking utensils than this hammer. My husband and I play with it more than she does. I still think it's a cute toy but maybe it just didn't fit my daughter's tastes and personality.
2,doesn't quite deliver,"I planned on using this equipment instead of carrying around an amp while traveling. The stealthplug itself works fine. Has a little hiss to it. But the software that comes with it does not work. I have tried several whys to fix it including tech support. The drivers do not seem to be Vista compatable. In short, if you are wanting to use the effects advertised, be wary."
4,"StealthPlug does the job, needs software update","I bought the StealthPlug to use with my laptop (Windoze 7/64, you bet I'd rather have a mac!)while spending a couple months in a rehab facility after surgery. Figured I might get some recording in.Fortunately, I'd read the other reviews here and knew the install was going to be a bit more involved than just a quick driver download. I set up my account with IK and downloaded Amplitube 3 and SampleTank 2.5 and the updateddrivers. These work fine.Tracktion 2 refuses to co-operate with registration as does SampleTank 2LE--only one serial number was provided, which went for Amplitube 2. Good thing I knew about Reaper.The unit itself does well, a little noisy, but I'm using a Telecaster, lol."
4,Good product,"This is a great interface for playing on the go. Just plug it into your PC, MAC or laptop, plug the guitar & headphones & you can play along with the included software. The software is an older version so if you like it (and it is a great piece of software) you'll have to upgrade & that can cost lots of $$$$. But you can good deal from time to time @ ikmultimedia.com, so be patient and wait for the bundles or special offers."
3,Disappointed,"My wife liked theYamamotoyama Genmai-cha Green Tea with Roasted Brown Rice, 1.69-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)green tea with roasted brown rice & asked me to order more. While I was shopping, I found the same type of tea from Eden. The Eden tea appealed to me because it was organic, got great reviews, and was more expensive than the Yamamotoyama brand, so I assumed it was better quality. When I got the tea, I made a cup of each at the same time to compare. I was surprised to see that the less expensive Yamamotoyama was a little darker, and the roasted brown rice flavor was stronger. I realize the roasted brown rice green tea is considered inferior, but if you like that taste, I think more of it is better. I think the reason for the difference is that, the Yamamotoyama had about twice as much tea in the bag as the Eden. I'll try to post some pictures."
2,Not my most favorable purchase,"I recieved most of my formula in dented cans. I had to throw out two cans. However, the customer service reps compensated me. I still shop amazon, I'm just afraid to purchase formula agian. The formula itself is, ok. I might have to change it, I dont think the baby is takin gto it well. He is almost 11mths so he can have whole milk soon. Maybe because the cans were dented, I'll try another batch."
5,incredibly helpfull for beginers and meddles,"I found it very helpfull specially answering one of my biggest questions..do I have to stay in this only room of my house wich i am finding boooring? or can i move my mess to some other place like the kitchen table?? I can move my messes to any (or almost any)place in the house.. I also found out that I can hire people to sell my jewelry and i dont have to ""PRETEND"" to be a sales person wich I'm not..and how to price my merchandise(that I was doing well not over nor under pricing).and on and on..."
5,Very even-handed,"Unlike, say, the same book regarding Hungarian pilots (Hungarian=jingoistic; and I say this having been to Hungary and having enjoyed myself immensely-though pre-financial collapse), this book is a fascinating & even-handed look at the air war over Romania. It was far more than just Ploesti, although its hard to just devote 10-20 pages (or so) to such a significant event in USAAF-USAF history. Its only with the drop of the Iron Curtain that I've come to appreciate the Me-109 as something more than a 2nd rate FW-190. A very versatile & effective plane!"
3,"Funny, scary, hopeful","This was the first book that I have read by this author, I was impressed by the message of hope that rose out of some sad and dire circumstances. The description of a man falsely suspected of a crime against a child was chilly, but the character's gradually coping rang very true. I was glad to see a reference to a series because I will want to see how the characters fare.Finally, there are many very funny characters in this book."
2,It was HARD to get through.,"I thought this book was horrid! I'm so sorry to the author, but dang! He was manipulative up until the point that he just wasn't. what's up with that? and they she just forgives him? yeah right!"
1,Yuck,"Yuck. I never read the books this author wrote earlier and found myself trying to understand what was going on here. It was obvious that the plot referred to a plot of a past book The many, many characters who swirled all around this story but were never fully developed were all protagonists in other books. The chemistry of the love interests was lacking, with the heroine constantly throwing herself at the unwilling hero. The romance was depressing."
1,Too Wordey,The book could have been 100 pgs. shorter then maybe it would have been good. A really good book I can sit down and read from start to finish in one setting this book took me 5 days to read and that was with skipping some of the really boring stuff. I gave it to a woman I work with and she felt the same as I did. It only took her 4 days to finish. Save your money or if you think you really have to have it buy it at a second hand book shop.
3,"The ""rogues"" are always studs.......","but the story itself is pretty same old, same old, regency stuff. This book is one of the 3 in the ""3 heroes"" anthology andit is the best of the 3. It's an ok read but not a keeper although the characters are very explicit and involved and likeable.."
4,"Worth the money, especially with the rebate","Good product, works as advertised. I've noticed a little better throttle response, and slightly better milage. The box did arrive slightly crushed inside of another box when sent from Amazon, but the filter was fine. No harm, no foul."
5,Great Book,"Keith Jones' book, ""Knowing Bass"" is a great book and serves an important niche. Jones' book is not so much a book about fishing tips and techniques. Although, through careful reading of the tests and the experiments you will learn great things about bass. If you purchase this book expecting tips and techniques you will be disappointed. If you purchase this book wanting to know details previously unknown to the general public then you will be greatly satisfied.However, this book does a great job of explaining the physical intracacies of the bass. I highly regard this book and would urge all serious bass fisherman to read it a few times.--Chad Battles"
3,alittle hard to follow at times,"This book is a bit to hard to follow sometimes. It reads like every reader/angler is a scientist, this is not the case. Most of the books content comes from scientists who have run tests in labs and in controlled enviroments owned by large tackle makers. Don't get me wrong there is usefull info in the book but like the title says ""The scientific approch to catching more fish."" this is true. I would consider buying a different book to get basic info and tips. Like I said the book can be usefull but a bit to indepth for the average angler looking to better his catch. So overall average book. Good luck on the water!!"
2,Not Very Useful for an Angler,"This book's title sounds good. Who wouldn't want to know the results of controlled studies on how fish react to different techniques. Well that makes up about 10 pages of this book. In case you want to know: putting a flavor on a lure seems to work, scent not really, and bass will hold on to soft baits much longer than hard baits. Most of the book reads like a biology lesson charting out various organs in the fish and describing their functions. The problem is that there is no real connection made between this and fishing techniques. Does it help me to know how different sense organs attach to the Bass' brain? for me not really. If you are really interested in Bass physiology perhaps this would be worth reading, otherwise I would not recommend it."
3,"Science book, not fishing book","A very well done book overall. I was hoping for more useable information for fishing. There is a lot of scientific detail that is of limited use for actual fishing. But, there is enough useful information to be gleaned to recommend it."
4,"iRhythm great for its price, but could be improved....","(..) I actually stumbled upon this while looking for MP3 players at Amazon, and nearly lost it when I realized I could play my 400+ Mp3 files off my 400w stereo! Received the product today, and it took less than 10 minutes to set up (software installation included). My only real problem was that the audio controls on Windows Player (on the PC) needed to be modified (uncheck ""digital output only""). That alone took about an hour of my time, since there was no specific support item at iRhythm's website. At any rate, I now have 800 internet music stations from German techno to classical, and the Mp3s are roaring out of my stereo. Unfortunately, the sound comes out lower than normal, so even at full stereo volume the sound is subdued. Still, this is one cool toy!"
2,Software Issues / No Support,"I like transmitting audio from my machine to my home stereo. My wife really likes it a lot - Austin radio is terrible - so getting a few thousand more stations is great. I bought the remote tuner though and the software always crashes. I wrote support and got no answer. I've also checked the web -- nothing. Also weekends are bad because many people are using their cordless phones in our building and so we get the loud ""BBRRRRPPPP!"" every couple of minutes when someone uses their phone or gets a call."
2,poor reception,"the idea is great, the problem is that if you live in an apartment, like i do, you may have trouble with the weak transmitter.my transmitter and receiver are only 20 feet apart, and the sound is really distorted at times.depends on your location."
1,Wireless Weakling,"While the idea of being able to wirelessly access our music and Internet radio channels sounds great, the fact of the matter is that this product is not the one to break new ground with.The device looks cool enough. But upon installation, it was immediately obvious that there were huge gaps in performance. It's ability to transmit a decent signal was lost. Not even in the same room with the transmitter was it able to work properly.Being an electronics gizmo addict, I had no problems understanding the easy to follow instructions, or the layout of the remote tuner. Still, it's a great idea, but with poor exectution.If your looking for remote access to your MP3 files, go with the Dell Remote Tuner instead. It uses the telephone lines, has a traditional remote control, performs flawlessly, and may someday be able to tune in Internet Radio.RTD."
2,Great concept...poor product,"The concept of this product is great, however what the manufacturer does not tell you is that there are many devices in your home (cordless phones, baby monitors, even your PC) that could interfere with the reception of the remote receiver. I spent many hours trying to tune the receiver with the transmitter with no success, even when the transmitter and receiver were within feet of each other.I found the documentation and technical support for the product left a lot to be desired also.I have chose to ditch the idea of using the tuner remotely, but I am going to use the device as a wired device to my home stareo. Plugging the device directly into my home strero provides great reception and terrific sound quality."
5,Best cleanser for sensitive skin I have found!,I have tried OH SO MANY cleansers for my skin and this has proven to be the best I have tried. I also cannot tolerate fragrance and this product honors that as well. And the bonus for me is that it is $10-$20 cheaper than many of the cleaner I have tried!
4,This book,"I think thought the book could be tighter and have more information, the price was well worth it. I have enjoyed reading this materials and will make it a part of my permanent library."
4,Good Hemp Protein,"Ruth's Hemp Protein is great stuff! It doesn't taste great & is indeed a bit grainy/earthy, but if you mix it as a smoothie with fruit you won't even be able to taste it. Those who are used to hemp & similar products will not mind the taste/consistency, but if you are coming from whey protein, don't expect to just mix this with water & drink it down with a smile. Taste aside, the product is excellent - provides a great amount of protein & nutrients per serving. Recommended - 4/5."
1,You'll do better with internet searches than this book,I was incredibly disappointed in this book. I haven't taken a cruise in over a decade and still didn't learn a thing reading this book. It reads like a travelogue for various islands in the Caribbean but offers no insights on any of the ships or any of the lines. It didn't have much on shore excursions either. I learned more from the various cruise lines home pages than I did from this book.
3,Not JRH at her best,"As a big Janis Reams-Hudson fan, I was a little disappointed with this book. The characters seemed very two dimensional and not really that interesting. The book was predictable, written as if the author were just going through the motions of getting another book finished. The characters lacked the details that would make them realistic and likeable. Most JRH books are a one-sitting read, but this one was a struggle to finish."
3,A Crash Course Indeed!,"This author takes you through the first 25,000 years of art history in a mere sixty-three pages, including the Renaissance, and devotes fully one-third of the book to the modern art of the twentieth century. Perhaps I was mislead by the title, hoping for a little bit more attention to Mona's time. A better choice would be Thomas Hoving's ""Art for Dummies"", with his more objective point of view."
4,Very Accessible,"I use this book for a survey course for undergraduate and graduate students who are non-art majors. It is far more accessible than most texts of that type, and far less detailed and costly as well. A perfect start for someone trying to grasp the basic concepts involved. I recommend it highly for that purpose."
5,The Best Start,"I am starting my first Ar History class this fall, and I was a bit lost on what to expect. I bought this and gained more confidence in the subject. The text is easy to understand and full of information along with interesting facts. It's far from a bore to read and gets into just enough so you'll have an understanding of the overall history."
2,Not what I expected,"The type is different all over the page and makes for hard reading. It is not cohesive and seems to be just bits and pieces. Quite disappointing - considering it was ""recommended"" when I purchased other books."
4,a wonderful introduction,"The Annotated Mona Lisa is a fabulous introduction to the history of western art from pre-history to the Post-Modern era. Artists, movements, vocabulary, and specific works of art are all discussed in enough detail to give the reader a very good foundation. The only thing lacking is that it is oriented exclusively towards Western art. Boswell has done a marvelous job on the art of the West, its a pity attention was not given to the art of Asia, the Americas or Africa - especially considering the influence these regions have had on western art through the ages. Nonetheless, a recommended resource."
5,Creative Titling really delivers,A great book. It certainly solved my problems and I would heartily recommend it to others. Ms. Morgan has a way of clearing up complex problems with simple solutions well spelled out.RM
5,Creative Titling Made So Easy,I want to thank Ms. Morgan for writing this book. I'm not a pro at the computer but this book has simplified the process of being artistic. We need more authors who know what they're talking about who are able to convey that knowledge to those of us trying to learn the process. I hope Ms. Morgan continues writing these technical books for non-technical people like me. Thank you.
2,too different from the earlier edition,"I came across a very early edition of this book and thought it was great, but it was out of print. I thought that this book would be similar but there were major differences. While the earlier edition provided extensive word lists organized around the consonants, this book was organized around vowels. The only word lists that were based on consonants were much shorter in comparison. Although I sent the book back and can't reference it, I seem to remember that they were around 15 to 20 words long. Also, while the words in the earlier edition were useful for adults, the words in this later edition seemed to be geared toward children. For me, the book went back, although someone who is focused on vowels and working with children would probably find it useful."
5,Everything You Need to Know!,"I'm new to this classic game and this player's guide has been extremely helpful in understanding all its aspects. I have the Nintendo Wii version of the game and it came with a very bare bones instruction booklet so I almost feel like this an essential purchase for novice players who have the console version. Trust me, this will maximize your pirating joy!"
2,Not great for bedroom,"I wanted a unit for my nightstand during the winter and the size of this is perfect for that, however... This unit was quiet at first, but after the first few times using it, there is an annoying humming of the unit - even when NOT turned on, if it is plugged in, then it has a humming vibration which is annoying for right by the bed. Also, the designers put this giant, bright red on-indicator light on the unit, I found myself having to try and cover the light up with whatever I could find so the light wasn't so bright while trying to sleep."
1,Don't bother!,"I purchased this humidifier from target a little less than a month ago and it already stopped working. I wasn't even running it 24 hours a day - only at night while I was at home. Even while it was working, I was not thrilled with the product. Initially, I had the unit sitting on the floor. When it was turned all the way up, it would leave a film of water on the floor around it. Can you say water damage? I eventually moved the unit on top of a dresser so that the mist would evaporate before it hit the ground.All in all, not a very good design and obviously poor construction. After paying $30, it should work for AT LEAST a year. Will not be buying from this brand again."
1,Puddles!,"We got this today and are returning it tomorrow.As advertised, it put out a substantial volume of cool mist, like other ultrasonic humidifiers. Unlike others that we have owned, however, it put the mist out at such a low velocity that a substantial amount of the mist sank (instead of rising) and puddled on the floor next to it.We could (and did) put a towel down; but there's no reason to settle for a poorly designed product when other, similar devices work well."
5,A must have for parents with school age children.,This book is absolutely fabulous. I have found countless tips that have helped me with everyday school related activities. The School-Savvy parent is easy to read and also serves as a quick reference. I highly recommend this book to anyone with school age children.
1,Waste of time and money,"This book is a glorified version of everyday common sense. It is full of ""insightful"" tips like 'Check your child's backpack and schoolwork each night' and 'A child who has a fever, upset stomach, flu or severe cold or cough should be kept home from school.' Gee, why didn't I think of that! If you need a book to tell you these and other ""insider"" tips then you need more help than this book could possibly give you! I bought this book because I was looking for homework and test taking tips for my second grader. I was very disappointed."
4,Great Self Teach Book,"I first encountered this book when I was in High School, as a Year 11 textbook. Having bought myself a copy, I have found it to be amazingly helpful, right through until the end of my second year of learning Japanese at University. Although at first it may seem intimidating, the pace at which this book is set is challenging, yet entirely achievable. It begins with very simple conversations, such as introductions and directions, and moves through to discuss modern Japanese literature, in Japanese. Each chapter is clearly set out, featuring sections of Japanese text, its English translation, new vocabulary and a section upon the grammar used in that chapter. It also has teaching and learning exercises at the end of each chapter. If you want a Japanese text to take you past the mere basics, this is a brilliant purchase."
1,Cover broke off before I could even install it. Junk.,"This is a very cheeply made product. There are better made products that do the same and cost the same, available on amazon.Save your money and avoid this one. The protective weather cap broke off the port after about three times opening and closing it."
3,Re-written in plain English and Abridged,"I was dissappointed when I received this book to find that it is an abridged version that has been re-written into easy to read language. Although I find the original language difficult, it wasn't just re-written in modern language, it was dumbed down and parts cut out. Some of the original punch was lost. However, it is available for free as a download online since it is so old. Look for vol 6 of his works and have lots of paper."
3,THIS IS NOT OWEN'S WORK!,"I was disappointed to see that this was not Owen's work, but rather a paraphrasing and abridgment of it. I'm sure it'd be easier to read, but that's like saying The Message is easier to read than the NASB or ESV. (Yes, I know Owen is not inspired.)This book would be great for a student in middle school or high school.I returned this book and opted for the one edited by Taylor and Kapic."
1,On 4th player,"I can't believe this player! I've exchanged it at the store 3 times now and each player has quit on me. It will play for awhile, but then just won't come on anymore. The customer service agent said I probably need to reformat the player, but my computer can't even find the device when I plug it into the USB port. Insult to injury, Customer Service has not been much help! I wouldn't even give it one star, but I had to rate it with something."
1,Died in 8 months Smartdisk difficult to deal with,"The drive was great but only lasted for 8 months when it crashed, and I lost all of my data. SmartDisk was not helpful at all and actually rude when trying to resolve this issue - I finally gave up and will never buy a SmartDisk product again! CAUTION ADVISED!!!JoAnn"
3,Shrug.,"The review above fails to mention the involvement of Mark Spybey in the project, the man behind Dead Voices on Air. At any rate, this early Download release varies between accessible industrial-techno and more experimental, less structured tracks. There are some fine moments but the later discs are more cohesive and fully realized."
5,What are you waiting for?,"If you're an Anglophile, Brit lit fan, or someone who simply likes smart, classy, well-written, and well-acted films, buying this set should be a no-brainer. These films range from good (The Scarlet Pimpernel series) to excellent (Ivanhoe) to superb (Pride & Prejudice).If you're part of the A&E/Bravo/PBS/BBC set--and you know who you are :) --then you'll find plenty of your favorite authors here, like Austen, Scott, Fielding, and Bronte, and favorite British actors like Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morton, Colin Firth, Jonathan Price, Peter Ustinov, Christopher Lee, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Grant, and so on.All told, despite very minimal DVD extras, this is a superb collection that will repay you with many hours of enjoyment. If you like this one, be sure to check out A&E's Horatio Hornblower series for more engrossing period drama."
4,Bought the set for Pride & Prejudice,"Like the review title says, I bought it solely for the P&P. I hoped that the other titles would prove to be equally as entertaining and well made. If you have read the other works, you'll find them to be fairly accurate to the books and well made. A&E is known for quality programming and this set is a good one to add to any collection."
5,wonderful films,These films are all classics to be viewed again and again. Amazon price was a bargain. Shipping was fast. These wont always be available so anyone interested needs to consider ordering soon. Some vendors have already discontinued.
4,Classic Romances,"This was purchased as a Chritmas gift, that turned out to be a duplicateand was retained for personal use, since it was such a bargan. It wasrecieved speedily and in new conditiion."
3,Less is more,"The Colin Firth version of P&P is probably the most popular version of P&P and is definitely what influenced me to buy this box set. Emma and Jane Eyre were also enjoyable but they weren't my favorite adaptations. As for all the other movies, I don't see myself watching them more than once. I wouldn't recommend buying this entire box set unless you have actually seen all the films already."
2,"Definitely not in ""very good"" shape","The box was torn and scuffed, and every dvd and case had someone's name written on it in permanent marker. Very misleading to say this was in ""very good"" condition. I would not recommend this seller."
4,Beatnik Bear...,"Larry is a bear. Larry is also a beatnik. He snaps his fingers, wears berets and sunglasses, and recites poetry. His best piece of poetry, entitled ""Are Muffins Like Fish"", ends with the lines ""I like blueberry muffins but there are no blueberry fish."" Larry is just cool. Not much more to say. Cool. He gets in trouble when he plays in the park after eight o'clock and has to return to the hotel Larry. The whole family - he lives with Martin, Semolina, and Mildred - turns cool and they hang out at the Cafe Mama Bear which is crammed with cool bears of all different types. Larry has the opportunity to play bongos for Big Bear. It's Larry's big break. Of course everything is cool in the end.This is classic Pinkwater. Very likable, but not easy to determine why it's likeable. It just is. Also, it's coming back into print in paperback soon. A very good thing."
1,What kid knows what a beatnik is?,"I had read my son other Larry books, and found this one at the library so I checked it out. As described above, it's about beatniks. Why would a child care or know what a beatnik is? The dialog is dumb, the blueberry juice is puzzling, and this book had no point. Skip it and pick another Larry book."
4,"Not perfect, but darned good","Read this book for a book club and, after averaging individual scores of the 10 or so folks attending, it came away with about a 9 on a 10-point scale. That's generous, but it's an absorbing tale with a few twists at the end.I had some problems with the book from a purely literary standpoint -- the main character was a bit forced, his woes handled in an equally forced way -- but I thoroughly enjoyed it from the pure reading angle.Bottom line: If you're looking for an absorbing, entertaining book, this is it. If you're looking for ""To Kill and Mockingbird"" soul-searching stuff, go back to the original."
2,"Good Writing, Bad Theology","A flawed book by David L. Robbins is still a good read. The author is a master of his craft, and Scorched Earth is absorbing. I was led to this book because I so appreciated his WWII novels.But a warning to readers with religious sensibilities: the book panders to our secular world's desire to make pastors look like colossal hypocrites and fools. Scorched Earth's preacher Thomas Derby makes the Scarlet Letter's Reverend Dimsdale look like a saint. In contrast Robbins portrays the book's mill workers as earthy, noble, fulfilled simple-folk. Derby is not a credible, believable character. He's just a caricature, betraying a lack of respect for organized religion."
2,Bit of a disappointment,"I was disappointed with this book; it started out as a good read but then bogged down. The author tends to be repetitive, going over and over about how great a soldier Remy Schrijnen was without really saying much about what was going on or what he did. I finally got tired of it and started skimming through sections, then just put the book down. While I was disappointed overall, there are some sections and pictures of interest that may prove useful to dedicated students of lesser known German (SS) units and combat on the Eastern Front. At some point, I will probably pick it up again, gloss over certain sections and finish the book, but for now it will gather dust on the shelf."
4,The Last Knight of Flanders: Remy Schrijnen and His Ss-Legio,"Excellent book, highly advisable for all those interested ones in knowing more envelope the European volunteers that combatted against the Bolshevism in the Oriental Front. To know what it motivated them that they waited and why they made it."
1,Heh?,"This is not one of Balzac's great works. First, if you are not extremely fluent in French, you will find the language in this book very difficult. The story is a bit strange to begin with, but visualizing what is happening or even what this mysterious talisman looks like is all but impossible. As you trudge through the pages and pages and pages of this book, you're always hoping it will get better, that you will be stimulated in the way that Balzac had done before, but to no avail. Reading should be fun, but this is drudgery."
2,Design Masturbation ?,"Each page of this book is beautiful. Aside from that it's basically meaningless, the 'illustrations' have either a very obvious or no connection to the peace ideas. It's great that 10% of the proceeds to wagingpeace.org's mission for a more peaceful world... but why would anyone want to spend so much money on a self-promo disguised as a socially relevant book."
3,No sweat.,"I read reviewers' comments before purchasing this DVD and gathered that it is geared to the needs of senior citizens. The introduction specifies it is designed for people over 40 years old. Well, I'm 70 and there's no way I'll burn fat using this program: I didn't break a sweat. The instructor is nice, but her tone is slightly (even if unintended) condescending, as though old folks need to be spoken to like bigger children. So I'd say this exercise routine is definitely for the elderly, exercise beginners or the very out-of-shape. If the DVD were $9.99, not $19.99, I might give it another star (but probably not)."
1,Check Your Facts!,"On page 42 the author states that the Batcave was a dance club in New York City. The Batcave was actually a dance club in London, England. Check Wikipedia. This makes me wonder what other information contained in this work is incorrect. Glad to say I'll never find out since I'm sending it straight back to Amazon!"
2,Heart in the right place but...,"The idea of this book is great; the delivery is not. I feel that a book like this could be a great asset to enlightening people to darker aspects of our society. However... it is so poorly written that I would lose focus on what I was reading. The author is too close to whom he interviews and so it appeared to me to be more of a showcase of his friends rather than what they had to really say about things. There were actual misspellings within the text, which I also found disappointing."
5,Enriching the mind and soul...,After reading this book I found my eyes open wider to a great many things that most people didn't understand about subcultures that are regurlaly misrepresented by the general populace because they either didn't know what it really was about or chose to ignore the truth and condemn which they feared was different. Corvis did an excellent job not only presenting what these various cultures about but what links them togethar. Everything from interviews with famous and real day to day people along with his own personal experiances and studies in each of the various cultures history. Anyone willing to learn about things they didn't understand or where curious to learn about something that fascinates them I would highly recommend this book.
5,Amazingly Well Done,I just love this book.When I was approched to be interviewed for it I jumped on the oppertunity.I believed in it then and I was blown away by how well written it is.Corvis has combined first hand experiance and knowledge with history and myth busting about the dark subcultures of today.He has scratched the surface of truely showing this world of ours how wonderful it really is to live in the darkness.I recommend this book to anyone who is within or is curious about the alternative side of the world!..A must have for any new age library or occult collection!!
4,Quality,Mystikal's Ghetto Fabulous is a pretty sick cd. He has all types of songs and number 10 is just tight. Any time I feel like gettin' pumped up or bumpin' I can just throw this cd in.
5,I smell smoke.,"This album is the roughest s**t No Limit has ever done.Don't say this album is not dope cause u know it is.Anybody who doesn't like this album has something seriously wrong with them,take them to a hospital now.This album should go quadriple platium.The beats on this album are tight but if Master P was rapping on them it would be s**t.Round out the tank and whatcha want, whatcha need are the dopest songs on the album.I smell smoke.This album's on fire"
1,U call Mystical a rapper?,"This, is probably the worst album around. worse even than snoops game is to be sold album. Even being called the biggest pile of s**te in the whole of rap is too good for mystikal. Im sorry but he is just a complete f**king muppet. If u have this album please send it back to no limit and get ur money back bcoz this piece of s**t No Limit calles a rapper isnt deserved of your money."
1,This kid is whack,"Oh my God, here is the worst rapper of all time. He can't tighten his lyrics to the beats, the guy is just so un co-ordinated, it seems unbearable to listen to. It's like a badly produced primary school production. Avoid this and all No Limit(apart from Snoop)at all costs"
5,Mystikal is TIGHT,Mystikal you and the whole NO LIMIT FAMILY are the best. My dream is to meet you guys someday.
2,Buy Unpredictable instead,"Beats are tired, lyrics uninspired, not as tight as Unpredictable. He needs a new production squad. You could feel him on his last album, but he's not bringing it on this one."
5,Ghetto Fablous is the bomb!!!!!!!,"I have been a fan of Mystikal ever since I could remember, and of all his albums that he has made this one tops them all. My favorite song on this album is I Smell Smoke, that song rides out, as a matter of fact the whole album is tight.Mystikal you are the best."
5,MYSTIKAL IS THE GREATEST I AM LOVING HIS STUFF,I DON'T CARE WHAT NOBODY SAYS MYSTIKAL IS THE GREATEST. CAN'T NOBODY FLOW LIKE HIM HE HAS THAT ORIGINAL SOUND
3,A DISAPIONTING CD DROPPED TO FAST FROM NO LIMIT,"THIS CD WAS DISAPIONTING AND DROPPED TO FAST. TRACK 4 AND 10 ARE THE TIGHTEST, ALSO TRACK 1 ,7,9,12, AND 16 ARE DECENT STILL IT COULD OF BEEN BETTER. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK"
5,I love this album,"Mystikal to me, is the greatest rapper known to our generation. He's not afraid to speak his mind and say what he has to say. He flows with his lyrics as if their no end to them. He relates to the problems and situations that we teenagers deal with today."
2,Weakest Mystikal Ever,"I LOVE MYSTIKAL! Put him on anybody else's song and he will set it on FIRE! Unfortunately, he let me down with his third solo project. His debut cd ""Mind of Mystikal"" is his best due to his phenomenal rhyme skills and the supertight production by Precise. There are a few good songs on this cd, but only a few. I hope No Limit Records starts putting more time into their artists. How come Mystikal only had one single from this cd if it is so good like everbody says? Think about it!"
2,"""Where's The Beef?""","I'm really interested in this product,but, even if a sample of the songs are unavailable, where's the song titles? Who, in thier right mind would buy this product without even knowing what is on it? Like I said before....Where's The Beef? jersey slim"
4,Good coverage of interesting topic,"Too much has been made of Lewis & Clark. The real exploration of America's West Coast and the real contribution to American culture was that of a select group of Boston traders who departed poor their New England homes, turned round the Cape, and up to the Pacific Northwest, there trading iron and wool for otter skins, the most dense and precious of all mammal pelts and one of two items alone that the Chinese would deign to purchase from Americans.Gibson tells the stories of these men, the men who established profitable trade for America, who brought hard currency into a broken economy, who set the stage for the American heritage of exploration cum capitalism that we see today in Silicon Valley.I don't believe it is a coincidence that the shares held by the investors (half), captain (tenth), supercargo (seven percent), and crew (33 percent, total) mirrors that of technology companies today."
4,Texas Instruments TI-73,"This was a gift to my 10 year old Granddaughter who's in the 5th grade. She thinks it's excellent, and would not hesitate to let me know if she didn't think so."
2,Slightly Anachronistic,"Mary Balough is one of the stars of Regency romance. Although she sometimes has her heroines taking sexual risks that would have been unusual at the time (Slightly Wicked, Simply Unforgettable), her grasp of the history and tone of the period is outstanding. I can't imagine what happened here. Characters worry about psychological trauma eight decades before Freud invented the term. And carry on about each other's emotional baggage -- 175 years before Seinfeld! This appears to be a hastily-written, poorly thought-out novel, which is too bad, given other reviewers' clearly demonstrated strong interest in Alleyne's story. The rest of MB's work is terrific; I guess this is just a stumble in her waltz with the era."
5,Another Mary Balogh great,"This is the fifth book in the wonderful Bedwyn ser-ies.Mary once more gives us a wonderful heroine in Miss RachelYork.I also loved the amnesia device,as it really gave Alleynea chance to take really good look at himself&who; Lord AlleyneBedwyn truly is.I also loved the secondary characters.The ""lad-ies"" were four of the most genuine whores I ever ment&Mary; hasdone a good job making such women genuine stereotypes."
4,Best of this series by far!,"The first book I ever read by Mary Balogh was Slightly Tempted followed by Slightly Married. It's a miracle after reading those two duds that I ever read anything by her again. But I did and thoroughly enjoyed Slightly Wicked, A Summer to Remember, One Night for Love and her latest, Slightly Sinful. Sinful is probably my second favorite book of hers, first being One Night for Love. It's romantic, silly, sweet and in the end, very satisfying (unlike the incredibly boring Slightly Tempted and the incredibly unromantic Slightly Married). I'll keep reading Mary Balogh, even though she is very hit and miss, and I can't wait for Wulfric's story, I hope it's as lovely a story as Slighty Sinful was."
4,good historical romance,"This love-story has an engaging plot, I was swept away by this tale of the privileged gentleman Lord Alleyne who is shot and injured in battle, only to awaken in a brothel. But he took a vicious fall from his horse, hitting his head, and he can't remember anything, even who he is. He's nursed back to health by the equally well-bred but hapless Rachel. Once married, she's supposed to inherit a fortune, so Alleyne thinks up a scheme where he pretends to be Rachel's husband in order to help her get the fortune. But in the process of all this pretending, they genuinely fall in love with each other. They'll have each other, but will they also get the inheritance? Fun escapist reading. Recommended especially for female readers."
3,Slightly Good,"A good story line with entertaining characters. Just a bit thin on the relationship between Alleyne and Rachel. And, without spoiling the plot, let me just say that their sexual relationship was rather cold."
4,Nice but ...,"Allyne Bedwyn is on a important message for the Duke of Welllington, when he shot and loses his memory. When he awakes, he finds himself in a brothel. Rachel York is young miss in a lot trouble. She lost her money and the money of her friends. Needing to work Rachel, her friends, and Jonathan head to Rachel's uncle in hope claiming money they need.""Slightly Sinful"" by Mary Balogh is the first book that I by this author, while it was okay this book just seem long and I wanted it to end."
3,...,"I agree that this was not really that awesome. I found myself skipping pages too, looking for an interesting scene, or even a conversation. I was not that fond of Rachel. This is not Balogh's best work. Unless you're a huge Alleyne fan or something, you won't find this book in the Bedwyn series all that great."
4,What an interesting name,"I am a huge fan of this series, but in this book I was very bothered by two thing. First, that I found numerous typos! And very obvious ones! I found three on one page! I was also bothered by not knowing how in the world to pronounce Alleyne's name! Throughout my readings of the first few books and the beginning of SLIGHTLY SINFUL, I had been pronouncing his name Allen, even though I knew it was wrong (Allen is not, after all, as odd a name as one would expect for a man whose siblings are named Wulfric and Freyja). So I took a survey, searched the internet, and finally decided that Alleyne is without a doubt pronounced ah-LEAN. Once I figured it out I could relax and enjoy this book much more. He is, after all, a very charming man even if he cannot remember who he is."
5,excellent,"The film allows a brief viewing of the tapestry of terro woven by invader, Adolf Hitler, through the lives of four Resistance members during the invasion of their neutral country. Using original photos and film footage, as well as poignant interviews given by living members, the documentary puts its audience in touch with the strong moral character; bravery; intelligence; sophistication of these helpers of the persecuted and leaves the resounding feeling that if one does ""what is right and true"" even in the toughest of times, one may be able to find some peace in their lives."
3,Review,"After reading other reviews of this DVD, I had pretty high expectations. It was okay. I have seen him in other clips and he was hilarious. I still will support his work."
3,might offend women lol,He goes kind of hard when it comes to women so men beware if you're watching this with your lady. Your gonna laugh but you don't want your lady seeing you laugh at his jokes lol
3,"Good research, nice plot, but the main character bored me...","The Buffalo Commons was a great story idea. It was well researched and the prose was intelligent -- classic Wheeler. However, the main character fell short of being the bouncing protagonist we all enjoy reading about and walking beside. That alone made the book a struggle to finish. Wheeler has done better."
4,Interesting format!,"The novel has a wonderful plot and was fascinating reading primarily for the amount of research that Wheeler evidently put into it. He put that research to very good use. I found the format intriguing--it is set very slightly in the future (book was published in 98; the novel is set in the year 2000) so it consists of an extrapolation of current events into a future that is very close at hand.Contemporary novels of the west are pretty hard to come by, so Wheeler is a real ""goldmine"" for anyone who likes that genre.I thought, however, that Wheeler's characterizations and dialogue fell short of the level of skill required by his sophisticated and interesting plot. But this would not stop me from recommending the book to anyone who likes the genre."
1,Boring,"I bougth the wrong CD... This is ""speedtrace"" and all the songs are similar. You will get disapointed if you purchase this CD"
4,Hunt this one out,"Another very good album from Monty Alexander, thats worth looking for.Its quite unusual in some as it features only Monty Alexander on Piano and John Clayton on Bass. So no Guitar or drums, and this gives a very distinctive sound.As soon as you hear the first track, which is a swinging version of ""I let a Song Go Out of my Heart"", you might have a sense that theres something familiar about the sound of the Piano (which is really wonderful). I'd had the CD for years before one day I was reading the back of the CD case and suddenly noticed that the album was produced by the late Georg Brunner Schwer, who produced all the classic Oscar Peterson albums in the late 60's and early 70's (such as ""Tracks"").The recordings were made in 1983, and overall this a fine album of Ellington tunes. The problem now is that it doesn't seem to available. I got my copy from a 2nd hand record shop back in the 80's, which isn't very encouraging but if by some chance you find a copy its worth grabbing!"
3,"Half a book, but a good half?","There would seem to be some justice to the earlier review. This book obviously is handicapped by the absence of illustrations: some line drawings accompanying each species would greatly enhance the usefulness of this book. The color photographs are few (at most one per species), fairly small and many suffer from a dark background: also they are in a separate part and not near the descriptions. This book is not in the same league as John Laird Farrar's work for northern North America.Still the pictures are of a pretty good quality. For most species a distribution map is provided. The volume is well-printed. In many respects it complements Harrar&Harrar's ""Guide_to_Southern_Trees"". Maybe these two together make up a complete book?PS I don't dare judge the quality of the descriptions, although I do note that the authors refer to ""Betula alba"" as if it is an extant name, which is a pretty backward thing to do."
3,This book is difficult to use for anyone but a botanist.,"I found the book's keys difficult to use for identification of trees because the terminology was totally scientific. There were no drawings for clarity, and the photos were not adequate for identification. The book was a disappointment."
3,liked it...didnt 'love' it,"usually i LOVE andrew peterson. this is different, tho still with the sweet and welcoming voice. but...i dont know, just kind of new and maybe a little bit ?stale. i liked the title song a lot tho! but i miss the days of Carried Along and From Here to Venus :s but it isnt a *bad* cd, just not what i expected. but its got its own style and some ppl love it."
5,One of the better ones...,"Another Bower-related production, and one of the better ones, the ideas are not new but maybe sharpened a little bit, and though still it will recall the un/introduced listener to some other sofisticated noise items and artists it still has that unique, and in a way innovative sound that makes it typical Boweresque. Genuine simplicity is a good charactheristics I believe, and it's actually very hard to find, Sunroof succeeds in finding it - again - and does it beautifully and somewhat challenging...that's what makes this release a five star one."
5,Best Birthday Gift for a 2 year old...,My 2 year daughter received this on her birthday this past October. She loved it from the moment she opened it. She actually forgot she had other toys. I don't think she can get enough of it. It goes everywhere she goes. Fantastic!
3,Giant Claw Will Get You on your way home from movie!,"I am a Sci-fi Lover from way back in the mid 50's when I went to the Saturday movies! This movie..""The Giant Claw"" was one that I remember seeing twice because I liked it soooooo much! I have looked for this movie for years, but could never remember the name of it until I ran across it on Amazon! They say you can never go back...........well I guess in some ways that is true. As I remembered this movie as being more scarey then it really is. Now is seems kind of silly and tame to me, but as a 10 year old...it gave me some Big Thrills! I still do recommend it as it is different then most 50's Science Fiction movies. Not really Great Big....special effects, but still a novel idea and I remember being very scared of that BIG BIRD...swoping down and grabbing me on my way back home after the movies. I also remember the Bird's caugh, caugh, caugh sound for along time. KIDS...what did we know? But all in all........go for it. Great popcorn and Fun movie!"
3,"Unintentionally funny,but alot of fun....","If you like to see wires that are holding the monster,then this movie is for you.Campy,but alot of fun..This movie is perfect for MST3K,so that should give you what you're getting yourself into,if you buy this.If that's ok,then you should enjoy it for what it is..."
2,Three out of four ain't bad?,I ordered 4 of these plugs. The terminal on one arrived siezed to the core and was consequently useless. I'm sure they're great plugs but I won't discover any time soon.
4,Should have stopped here,I have enjoyed this series. Not great literature but a fun read and I liked the characters. Wish the ninth book didn't exsist.
3,Watchable,"I picked this movie up when i had nothing else to watch and was surprised, it is not a bad film at all. double and triple crossing goes on all over the place and it has a high level of humor. the acting is pretty good and it keep me entertained throughout the film. it falls just a little short of being artsy although it does try very hard to do so. give it a watch for something a little different."
3,Where's Alex Rocco? He's Listed In The Credits,"""Goodbye,Lover"" can be best described as a dark comedy informed by James M. Cain. It desperately wants to recall ""Double Indemnity"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" but tries a mite too hard. It's loaded with so many red herrings, doublecrosses, and triplecrosses that it gets a little dizzying. It stabs at dark comedy notably the murderess heroine, Sandra, (Patricia Arquette)and her affinity for ""The Sound of Music"" but that's a little trite and obvious. Regardless, the film is watchable mostly for it's performances. Noteworthy are Arquette who relishes the opportunity to chew the scenery, Ellen DeGeneres as a wisecracking detective, and Ray McKinnon as DeGeneres' gullible Mormon partner. It's an admirable attempt at recalling film noir of yore with some modern fluorishes but, alas, falls short of the mark."
2,Just okay,I wasn't crazy about this movie. I purchased it because I'm a huge Dermot Mulroney fan. He was okay in this one but not my favorite.
2,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * *,"Who would like this? : crime, drama & suspense fansWorth seeing?...-buy it : no-rent it : maybeRoland Joffe 1999Cast:Patricia ArquetteDermot MulroneyMary-Louise ParkerEllen DeGeneresRay McKinninAlex RoccoDon Johnson* not bad, a twist to the plot here and there but hey so many movies so little time so why bother with this one."
3,Patricia Arquette-Wow!,"This was a decent, entertaining movie and as a huge Patricia Arquette fan I bought the DVD before I saw it. I wouldn't call this film noir though it attempts be just that. I was told the story line jumped all over the place but I found it easy, if not too easy to keep up with the plot. I only gave this 3 stars because it was just too easy to see where it was going. The ending had a good twist but the rest was predictable. Patricia Arquette hasn't looked this good since True Romance. Go see that first."
5,Excellent,"First of all, I would like to say that it is a shame that this movie is not a box office hit as it is highly entertaining. I hope it gets a well-deserved second look with its DVD. All the casts are superb including Patricia Arquette and Ellen degeneres. There is enough plot and twist to make this standard murder mystery plot fresh. And funny script make this even more enjoyable.The plot basically is about the death of advertising executive (Don Johnson). His brother is the sole beneficiary of the insurance policy. So the police (Ellen de Generes) is suspicious. To say more will spoil the fun.The DVD is OK. Both WS and FS versions included. The color is bright and clear. The 5.1 sound only active during wonderful music score by John Ottman. Overall this is a highy recommended DVD."
4,"Good DVD, but sloppy production","Excellent to have this show out on DVD, but they lose one star for really quite poor production values. Typical of many DVD products, the ""team"" that produced the DVD are likely four guys using a PowerMac or some such thing. Besides the overall production being unimaginative and dull, the sound quality is very poor on these discs. The special effects and music tracks are cranked all the way up, but if you try to save your ears by turning it down you will find the dialogue impossible to hear at times. What is worse is that several times the sound is completely out of synch for 30 or 40 minutes at a time. It is doubtfull if the media team producing this product even checked their work afterwards. Five stars for Gerry Anderson and minus one for the sloppy, sloppy transfer to DVD."
5,Back To The Past,"I remember watching UFO when it came out in 1970. To a 9 year old into sc-fi it was a show worth watching and I looked foward to watching it every week. But alas as with many shows it went off after one season. UFO, took place in the 1980's and dealt with a secret agency that battled aliens from another planet from taking over the earth (or at least harvesting humans to keep their race alive). The 2 set DVD collection brings all 26 episodes back and brings the viewer back to the past to see how the late 60's producers saw the future.The 2 set DVD collection may not be perfect for everyone who dosen't remember the show when it was on in 1970 but the action (and I must admit campy) look of it at times will thrill those who like sci-fi made in the late 60's."
5,Fantastic,"I recently bought the aformentioned box set and it brought back memories as a kid getting up early on a saturday morning to watch the cool show. That Lt. Ellis was a real Hottie great costumes. made u wish you were on the moon too. However, one thing this set lacked but apparently its on the british set is a booklet on the tv series and three postcards. I would have loved some more commentary and some other stuff but alas we all should be happy this finally came on DVD.. Looking forward to Vol 2 coming in 2003"
5,UFO Set 1,"Series that kept me on edge in the early 70's. Interesting story line about the response to an invasion by UFOs and the extent that the governments of the world would go to keep the information from the public. Only last one season, but still a show that bears remembering."
3,"Fashionwise, it was years before its time!","What I recall most of this series were the black girls with blue hair. Who would've thought that three decades later, my sisters would be sporting some hair colors to rival the ones shown on this barely remembered show?"
5,American Audiences can now enjoy uncut and clear UFO,"Previously available in the UK and Europe, this remastered edition of UFO contains a few niceties to complement the episodes. Purchasers of this set are probably already fans of the show which has re-emerged occasionally in the 30+ years since the original run. The bulk of the episodic content is well known for its speculation of future life in a '60's vein.The biggest plus for this set is the clean video and the inclusion of scenes which have been ""chopped"" by broadcasters.The outtakes are reasonable but lack an explanation of why they are important. The ""Exposed"" scenes could have benefited greatly by written explanations of the differences versus the final episode.The physical product is packaged oddly. Little is provided in text form(No booklet), relying primarily on the sleeve for such info.Excepting minor details, this DVD offering is an excellent revisit of the SHADO world. Definately worth the price."
2,Maddy Prior: Arthur the King,"A bit of a disappointment. Haven't heard Maddy minus Steeleye Span. As a result, was less than impressed with the 'small' sound of the material. Some interesting tracks; easy listening but overall, not a completely satisfactory selection."
4,Interesting but Sobering,"I couldn't stop reading it once I started and it has some surprises. Not only is it an interesting story but it was emotionally sobering with it's all too real depiction of racial predjudice in America. However, it is clear, the author doesn't have an axe to grind on the issue of racial predjudice. Highly recommended reading! Enjoyed it!"
4,"Not as good as the first release, but it rocks, anyway!","All Star United's self-titled first release foretold of great things to come from this band. On their sophomore release, ""International Anthems for the Human Race,"" they do not disappoint. While not as good as their first CD, this one is pretty good in its own right. Songs like the hit ""Superstar"" and ""Thank You, Goodnight"" make the CD worthwhile. One question: where the heck did ""Welcome to Our Big Rock Show"" come from? If All Star wants to do that style, then do it on the entire album, not just on the opening cut. Nevertheless, the rest of the CD conforms to their traditional rock sound. Buy this CD if you are a true fan of Christian rock music."
4,Good sophomore album...,"I prefer the debut, but this one's good. I won't get into specifics, but this one lacks the utter charm of the first album. There are some songs on here that just sound like filler material to me.Still, it's good. Get it."
2,"After I heard ""Big Rock Show"", well.....","I thought that these guys suck. They are happy though, and all that energy goes into a whopping two stars from me. If I can get past how much I hate that first song, maybe I could be more objective."
3,Style Over Substance like much of the 90's,This may be tongue-in-cheek satire but I wasn't convinced that the band is in on the joke. IAFTHR has some catchy diddy-type melodies but is lacking in strongly crafted songs. 'Popular Americans' and '...Lovers' are tepid highlights that like the rest of the record are singable but never really satisfy. The Essential Label has put better stuff out.
2,Not very comfortable,"Item is alright. Have to be careful the supports don't fall out, there is nothing that holds them into the chair other than a ""cup"" of straps. I have sat in these at fairs and other craft shows and always really been comfortable in them. Unfortunatley, this one leans too far forward and I can't recline enough to be comfortable. Otherwise it seems to be a decent product. I actually hung it by an industrial spring (from Home Depot) which gives it a little more freedom to move/bounce. If only I could recline more in it I would be very happy."
1,Held together by glue,"I recently bought three of these and regret it! I just finished putting the first together, ready to sit in it, when the glue that held the threads together gave way (I weigh 120lb's wet). The nylon threads that hold you up are all glued in place, it is cheaply made. I would never invite a guest at my home to sit in one of these, great bodily harm could come to the invited guest as a result of the glue coming undone. Hot weather mixed with sun is a sure way to get undesired results from these chairs. Purchase and sit at your own risk!"
2,MP3 player cuts out fairly often,"I'm returning this item. If the mp3 player gets bumped slightly, it shuts off... this is fairly bad news if you plan to jog with it."
4,"excellent live ""gothic"" band translates well on first CD",The singer has a very sexy voice! She must be formally trained because a lot of her technique seems to come from Opera and classical music. These haunting lullabies are sung over simple drum machine/bass grooves with distorted or fingerstyle guitar and ethereal keyboard.
5,A gorgeous musical landscape.,"This is a lovely and dark debut. The sound is great, the composition is great, the lyrics are great... just about everything having to do with this album is splendid. A must have!"
5,The first is still the BEST!,"3 CD's later from this duo, and I have to equate it as the shining moment of their career thus far. This band created a great wealth of darkly danceable tunes and demonstrated a wonderous amount of creativity. Sadly, their follow up CD's did not have the same results as the first, but I am confident that these two will regroup their efforts yet again and surprise all their fans."
4,Textbook example of a good goth album,"I wish Switchblade Symphony had stuck with this mid-90s sound rather than going trip-hop. Why? I'm a whinybutt, THAT'S why. ""Serpentine Gallery"" is a great ""how to"" darkwave rock album. The opening track, ""Bad Trash"" is a goth dancefloor classic. The songs are a good balance of guitar, 80's synth and spooky vocals. They don't all sound the same, but it sounds like the band's having fun all the way through. The lyrics are better-than-average goth poetry. ""Bad Trash,"" ""Dissolve"" (dramatic tune, I must say) and ""Wrecking Yard"" cover a lot of ground and Tina Root's faux-operatic vocal style is cool. Sorry for using ""faux."" They moved into more Miranda Sex Garden-type music with the next two albums, but the lyrics stayed pretty close to the mood of ""Serpentine Gallery."" Switchblade Symphony is more about beguiling songs than Fitting Into Goth."
3,objectively...,"Most of the instruments are synthesized, so this album sounds very clinical and cold (in a bad way) the guitar parts are simplistic, otherwise there are no ""organic"" instruments. The arrangements are catchy but not really innovative, there's alot worse ""gothic"" music than this, but this isn't great. I'd say check out something like Mortiss - Smell the Rain before this, which is totally synthetic but much more appealing."
4,Darkly splendid,"This really is a great gothic album. Sounding low key and unagressive this is defintion of gothic beauty portrayed by the highly talented Tina. The songs are really great, ""Clown"" being my personal favorite, and they are not all copy and paste job either, the songs are diverse just enough not to distrib the album's great flow. However the only thing that leaves a lot to be desired is the production. Yes, one can see that Switchblade Symphony are a real small band, and as such have a really limited budget plus this being their debut album the production level is not equivilant to ammount of talent they have, so the end product suffers. But still this should be in every gothic lover's CD collection coupled with ""The Three Calamities"" of course."
3,"Done before, better","Lately pop music has been a wasteland. I have turned to gothic music, as some artists (ie Rasputina) still have an original spark and vision. I came to Switchblade Symphony with high expectations of originality and feeling.I was somewhat disappointed. Sure, their sound is inoffensive, even pretty cool. None of the lyrics moved me particularly. But I was irritated with the singer's consistent imitation of Souixie and the Banshees' stlye. Really, I couldn't tell the bands apart, most of the time, and S&B has a lot of classic old stuff I'd rather listen to. They have potential, and hope they realize it next time."
5,good book for people who wish to start craving,it you wish to start craving read this book. it will be a big help
5,SEXY!,It looked hott I repeat super hott in my car. It really compliments the interior with it's blue/white black outlines. It was very easy to clean and it does not slide under your foot. Also it's pretty durable. I had it for 3.5 months now and it's still very good.
1,Not the band they used to be.,"Back in the day, I was a big fan of FJB. This live cd appeared to be more of a reunion of the old band, and memories of better days gone by. The performance is weak, with changed phrasing on the songs, and altered melodies to accommodate a singers who no longer have the range they used to. Still, there are some shining moments, such as a couple enjoyable guitar solos. As for production value, it unfortunately has very little. It was neither well recorded, well mixed, or well produced.I DO, however, recommend the original Freddy Jones Band cd, or North Avenue Wakeup Call, when the band was at their height of ambition and creativity. There was an energy in those studio recordings that is way beyond the live cd described above. I only wish I could go back to 1998 or so, and see them live when they were truly ALIVE."
1,You're better off find a good bootleg.,"This is without a doubt the Freddy Jones Band's worst release. Not even a year after the band had lost two of the original five members, they tour with a replacement bass player, who just could not fill the shoes of their original. This left a huge whole in the backbeat that lead guitarist Wayne Healy tries to hard to fill with his lead guitar, and just can't pull it off.Barring a couple of exceptions, the live versions of their songs on this album lack emotion, creativity, or a powerful drive. It isn't even mixed very well.If you were impressed with the live tracks on the FJB original release (as I very much was) prepare to be sorely dissapointed."
5,Awesome CD,"When I first heard of Freddy Jones Band from a friend I HAD to order music from the band right away. Where to go?? Amazon.com of course!! This CD is just great! I play it constantly and never tire of it. It is uplifting, makes you happy, makes you tap your feet and fingers every time! It's a must have!! I have to order more yet. I highly recommend this set."
4,you don't need no stinking record label,This proves you can do this alone...great how-to and inspiration also. Stop waiting for a record label to deem you worthy...you already are...do it yourself!
2,Not completely accurate when it comes to dollars,"I was put off shortly into this book when the author started talking about how much money you can make when selling your cassettes and/or CDs. She says she spent $3,500 on recording and making 100 cassettes for her first record. She then sold them for $10 a piece and then had more made up. After selling 350, she had her investment back (apparently those 250 cassettes didn't cost her anything to be made). She then went on to say that she ended up selling 1,000 cassettes which brought her $10,000 -- a pure profit of $6,500! How the hell does that happen? Once again, those additional 650 cassettes must have been free for her to make up. This inconsistency with dollar amounts continues throughout the book. It's tough to believe anything else when these factors were so blatantly overlooked."
1,Warning: For Folk folks only!!!,"It should be made clear somewhere in the publicity info for this books that it does NOT apply to anyone other than those who are in the folk/acoustic scene. Way too touchy-feely for me, with very little practical information, especially for musicians who don't happen to play coffeehouses and open mic nights. Basically a waste of my money, but maybe it would work for some people."
5,Rod Piazza Stands Out!!!,"Rod piazza has for several decades been one of the best of the keepers of the Chicago Blues harmonica flame. His career began in 1960's with the Dirty Blues Band, then he spent several years working with ex-Muddy Waters harmonica player,George ""harmonica"" Smith. After Smith died in 1982, Piazza put together his band, The Mighty Flyers, to keep the tradition of Chicago Blues alive on the West Coast. The rest is musical history.The group has recorded over a dozen albums of the finest Rockin' Blues you'll ever hear and this CD is no exception. Backed by a band as tight as a drum, Piazza plays the harmonica and sings as great as any seasoned Blues giant. his harmonica playing is agood as it gets. He never over-does it, he let's the band, including the fabulous Honey Piazza on piano have their own say, then lets it rip with some very tasty harmonica.This is a thoroughly enjoyable album to listen to and I'd definitely suggest that you give it a listen."
2,Get This Book If You're A Robot,"Simply put, there are much better books than this. The format is hard to decode and not fit for 80% of Calculus students. The book is ordered in a logical way and is packed with information, but it lacks proper inductions to material and is just too packed. More expanded books, such as the Princeton Review or ARCO review books, are much better. Some people will do well with the terse format of the Barron's book, but I have found that it is a poor choice overall. The same goes for the rest of the Barron's series. Princeton Review is, by far, the best choice overall if you want good test review."
2,"Doesn't explain anything, poor examples.",This book was of no help at all to me. The only thing that it gives is the outline of what is going to be on the test. Nothing is explained. Sample questions are poorly organized. For example if you want to find problems on a specific topic you won't be able to because after each of the 10 sections there are 100 problems. This book is a waste of money. My textbooks are a lot better.
4,Good Study Aid,"This book was great but at first it didn't look apeasing cause it had way too many problems. At the same time the explanations looked horrific. Barron should somehow fix the format of this book and give it a more simplistic appearance.....Despite the explanations, the book actually gives a lot of examples ~ so the examples are actually more helpful than the explanations. I used this book profusely and started studying weeks before the AP exam. I did every problem at the end of each chapter (talk about being desperate to get a 5). If you get a lot of problems wrong don't worry too much cuz I think the problems in the book are harder than those in the AP exam. If you use this book and check out some of the essay questions (which can be found in collegeboard.com) you will kick butt in the AP exam. At the end it was all worth it ~ I got a 5 in the BC exam!P.S. if ur a slacker....this book is SO NOT FOR YOU!"
5,5 stars for a 5,"I absolutely loved this book. If you want to score a 5 on an AP exam I recommend Barron's prep books. Although I also like how the Princeton Review is funny and comprehensive, Barron books teach you the harder concepts and explain them so you won't make the mistake again."
5,Thank you Barron's,"This book was used as a textbook for the second half of my calculus class, and was probably the most helpful in preparing me for the exam. The whole book is laid out in AP-style questions, which gives you great practice with the format. I would highly recommend this to anyone taking either the AB or BC exam."
2,"good feel, but programming waaaay complicated..",It does have a nice feel; but I think if you're expecting a simple user interface with nice pictures to guide you with programming buttons- no way.. This will be like rocket science for most people. It has a very complicated setup. Took 3 hours experimenting before I started to get it to work.
5,Works great.,"The Siatek P2600 Rumble Pad works great. I found ou that the rumble does not work with the Star Wars Legos I game on PC, but other wise all controls work as you would expect."
2,flimsy housing,"I bought this power plug and installed it on my motorcycle. Two problems : one, the housing developed a crack after a year ; two, the inner metal cylinder that is the ground connection has gotten very loose so that whenever i pull out my gps power plug the metal comes along with it. very frustrating. i will be shopping for something that is better built."
1,Not a Good Choice,"I purchased this MP3 player in June of 1998. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on my first player of this kind (I got what I paid for I guess). At first it worked wonderfully--got to hear an entire audio book. I haven't heard anything since. The on/off button broke, I couldn't fix it. And, I had trouble accessing the player though my computer. Telephone support help was, in my opinion, rude and condescending (sounded like the same guy each time I called). I also found it hard to put music in the music section, audio books in the audio books section, etc. That could be due to my inexperience with portable MP3 players, however, I can usually figure stuff out.Anyway, lesson learned."
1,Bummer,Can`t give any good points on this one. Other than I was using one of my rewards cardsto pay for it.Not much cash invested. Never did work well. Had to use an adapter for my headphones. The earbuds that come with anything are a joke.Within 2 weeks I had thrown it in the trash as it quit playing.
1,Buy an iPod instead!,"Coby MP-C7092 MP3 Player with 2 GB Flash Memory with FM & Color DisplayI was excited when I first got the unit but the glitter was all gone after trying to recode videos and mp3s for use in MP4. For all my hard work I could not get the play list to work and the battery was almost useless, I can't watch a movie, in the middle of it I get the battery low indication. No matter how long I have it charging, it makes no difference, I have literally spent days with Mp4 hooked up USB port on my computer, still would not last a full movie. Radio has very poor reception. Controls are clumsy and inaccurate. Adjusting the volume will wind up changing songs or movies! Fast forward feature for movies does not always work, often it just advances to the next item on the list."
1,Bad Bad!,"I thought I was getting something nice for myself. What a waste of money never worked right from day 1. Really cheaply made too. I didn't even get a chance to use it a hour or two, it had no sound.Do not buy."
2,Ugh,I will admit I have not used this product a lot...but mostly because it became a giant pain. The controls are difficult to use and the file structure is annoying. I now have a GPS that has an MP3 player and I will be using that in my car (which was my intent in getting this Coby)>
1,PURE GARBAGE,"ok granted i bought this for 30 dollars and wasnt expecting a ipod, at the same time i wasnt expecting a worthless paperweight, you cant even use this as a paper weight it weighs virtually nothing, which usually is a good thing but this thing just feels cheap. besides the poor quality of materials used, interface is horrible, menus are extremely confusing. buttons make navigation worse. screen is not nearly as sharp as it claims to be. poor reception with fm tuner. if you dont have windows media player it is difficult to load music. creating playlist is nearly impossible. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.....do the right thing...spend more than 50 dollars ...or just be smart and buy an ipod or zune! have a nice day!"
2,The buttons don't know what you are trying to tell them.,"Budget mp3 player that doesn't work as well as most other brands. There is a delay when pressing the buttons of up to 3 seconds before screen changes or other actions. Sometimes when pressing a button for one action (such as menu) it will bring up another action (such as volume). Due to the short battery life it is not worth the time it takes to push play (less than 5 songs per full charge). I made the mistake of researching this unit after buying it, apparently these issues are inherent with the Coby brand mp3 players.However, it does play 2GB worth of songs if you are leaving it plugged into the computer (what's the point of that?) or a USB compatible stereo. The color display does have good picture quality. I would recommend going with another brand."
2,Really 2 1/2,"I really give this item 2 1/2 stars. I have a COBY which I really liked, but wanted something with more memory. This one is okay except that it keeps coming back to the same song and I find it difficult to call up the other cd's I downloaded. My original coby has a built in usb port which is very convenient because there is no extra wire to use or lose. I like having an FM radio to listen to as an option and really wanted the upgraded version of my original coby which is advertised, but for some reason not available. For the price it works well enough if all you want is extra memory and a device that is inexpensive that you don't want to worry about if you are traveling or jogging. All in all I am still getting used to it and haven't tried any of the other features such as voice recording and book downloads."
1,"Poor interface, cheaply made.",Read multiple reviews. I own multiple brands of mp3 players. This is the worst. Interface is text based. Its like using the original text based internet searches or dos/unix to find a song. I paid $24 for this 2gb MP-C7092. For a Sandisk e250 2gb unit I paid $33. Both units were purchased thru Amazon. These units go up and down in price based on Amazon inventory levels. I purchased a Sandisk c240 for #19.99 within one week it was $34.98. So wait for a reasonable price for another brand to be cheaper and skip this junk it really is not very good. Its like something you would get in a happy meal or a cereal box. Anything is most likely better.
2,DOA,"The player was DOA, showed something, when connected to PC, but will not turn on when disconnected."
1,"Sorry, this l'il bugger failed me 3 times","This product was a complete failure for me. Amazon went to wonderfully extraordinary lengths to take care of me, but the product was simply a dud.The original I got, a replacement I exchanged for, and another they sent me by 2 day shipping, all had the same problem: the internal battery would in no way be charged. I even tried on two different computers: my desktop and laptop. The desktop is a DELL, the laptop an Acer.I finally gave up, got a refund, and bought a COBY with a replaceable battery. That review to come. In short: MUCH better."
2,"Magic is not here, Cher must have shivered","This bio movie may please those desperate to find the S & C story,however..I was part of the Sonny and Cher generation,and this movie did not capture the sense of timing and the flower power feel that brought the couple to prominence.The magic of those days eluded the director.Mary Bono oked this project,and as stated before..Sonny told his story.Cher's perspective is not here.Someday someone with a greater vision will make THE Sonny and Cher movie.The performances are more like imitators than the real feel."
4,It's a fun trip down memory lane for Sonny & Cher fans.,"This TV movie about the career of Sonny & Cher was based on Sonny Bono's autobiography. As a fan I found it enjoyable and well cast, but it's obviously Sonny's side of their story. It would be interesting to hear how Cher remembers it.Still, the two lead actors do a credible job and their resemblance to their subjects is excellent. The story has to condense over thirty-five years of the duo's ups and downs into less than two hours, so a lot of events are telescoped and by necessity the film is very superficial.Don't expect depth, but it's lot of fun to watch and to hear their hit songs. It's definitely worth checking out if you're a Sonny & Cher fan."
5,great job...........!,"I really loved this movie. I thought the actors did a great job. The actress playing Cher really had her movements down pat and she REALLY looked like her! Enjoyed the music and just seeing how their ""hits"" came to be. Just wish it was longer!"
3,"Good Casting for ""And the Beat Goes On- The Sonny and Cher Story""",My husband and I were huge fans of the old Sonny and Cher show and really enjoyed this biographical depiction of their lives. We felt the casting of the roles was very appropriate and they really looked like the originals and did a great job with their music also.
2,A Guide For Entry Level Marketers,"The book is good and cursory. I recommend it as an introductory book. However, the information is outdated and does not reflect current marketing knowledge and understanding. The book does not discuss value based pricing, an integral part of any modern day pricing and marketing policy. It's branding concepts are weak. Most people would be better off with an introductory marketing textbook which explains fundamentals, or specialized expert books."
4,Great for the Desk!!,"I used to have one of these when I was a kid.. and it got lost along the way. When I stumbled upon it whilst looking for desk toys.. I couldn't resist the buy! I gave it 4 stars because it's not as sturdy as my original. I can feel the ridge seperating the chambers from the outside. Besides that, it's so much fun to watch and tool around with while you're taking a breather at your desk! Now I have to buy 2 more for my kids! LOL.. I also agree with other reviewers, I wish I could have picked my color.. I got a green one which wasn't the worst I could have gotten.. but not the one I was hoping to get!"
4,ALMOST exactly what I wanted,"This is almost exactly what I wanted. My only complaint is that you can't pick which color you wanted. This is identical to the one I got for a gift years ago, except the one I had years ago was yellow(my preferred color) The container material is very clear and had no extra tint in the acrylic or whatever plastic it is made of. I only wish I could pick the color."
5,Green Goo,My son has a learning disability and this sort of toy/aide is very helpful. He has serious issues with focusing and he enjoys watching the slow green go pass from one side to the other. It is amusing as well as helpful. The shipping was a killer (appx same as the product) but it did come right away and it was worth it.
1,Cute with Poor Quality,I purchased this as a gift. My Grandson loved these boots. They were just what a little Fireman needed. But the quality is very poor. Within 60 days they began to separate at the seams. Needless to say he is upset he can not wear his boots. Based on the quality I give this product only 1 star and would not recommend purchasing.
5,Very cool rainboots,"It's shipped very quickly. They look very nice and cool. My boy put them on right away. With his western chief umbrella, he played dress-up."
2,it was bad printing.,"These are good design; however the colors are different on the boots. One of the boots has black shading on the ""badge"" and the other boot does not! Kind of as though it was bad printing."
3,"Fun, but not very durable","We just bought our second pair, after the first pair fell apart (just like past reviews said). The heel and sole separated after lots and lots of wear. Even though I'm not impressed with the durability, we just had to buy another pair. The boots are adorable and our son loves them so much."
2,too bad....,"My son is in love with all things fireman, and couldn't be happier with the look of these boots. On the other hand, after about 3 months of wear (albeit constant), they have fallen apart. It's really too bad - they are awfully cute."
4,Makes 3 year old fireman happy,"I bought these boots, along with an entire fireman's outfit, for my 3 year old. I puts them on all the time and loves them. They seem well made as it has been 2 months and they are in good shape. They look and feel real (even the box looks right.My only minor negative comment about the boots (and the fireman outfit too) is they are not reflective like real FD equipment (which doesn't matter to him but if you are making fireman stuff why not go all out. . .)A nice product for young firemen everywhere."
5,Son loves them,"I bought these to complete my son's firefighter Halloween costume and he loves them. They have become a daily accessory. They were a little big, but that just made him able to wear them longer."
5,Being a Fireman,I bought the Fireman Rain Boots for my Grandson and had it shipped. My daughter hid it in her closet BEFORE wrapping them. My 2 year old Grandson saw the box with a picture of a dog on it and tore into it. They have been on his feet ever since (except when sleeping!!) The box was the give away. A great gift for a toddler.
4,Great boots - worth every penny,"These boots were a bit expensive, but they've been worth every penny. They have outlasted the Children's Place rain boots by a year. They still look great and he uses them daily. I'll definitely buy a larger size for next year."
1,happy for 2 weeks but then....,"I bought these boots for my son. He loved them when he first got them. They are so cute! Unfortunately it seems as though they piece these boots together rather than taking a solid boot and decorating it. The boots split at the seam in the front over the toes. The size was great, they were not tight but after wearing them several times over a 2 week period we had a hole. I think given the price of these boots they should have lasted much longer. I have bought plain rubber boots from walmart for half the price and they last till he outgrows them. We aren't real happy and will not purchase these boots again."
2,Too heavy!,"This boot is way too big and heavy for a toddler. My son (20 mons) could barely lift his leg with this boot on. They are very cute, but what's the point of a rainboot if a boy can play with them on."
2,"Cute, But NOT DURABLE!!","I have bought these boot twice now and both times they came apart at the seams around the toes within 2 months of wear. We live in a mountain area that consists of some paved roads and some dirt. My son mostly wears them on walks or playing in the yard. He plays like any other 5 year old, but these shoes do not hold up. His friend also got a pair and they came apart in the same area. I love the design but will not purchase again do to the lack of durability."
1,Look great/fall apart,"These boots look great when you first get them, but they don't last very long at all. It was only a few months into wearing them when I realized that they came apart. They don't just come apart a little, they come apart almost completely, at least to the point of them being some flaps of rubber held together here and there.They split pretty much everywhere the black meets the yellow. It's a real shame because they look like there nice, but you can't always judge a boot by its looks, I guess."
2,2 pairs and both fell apart,"We first got these boots for my [...]son for Easter and they split at the seam in about 1 month. Luckily this was just in time to have them replaced. Unfortunately after 6 months of wearing the replacements they too have multiple splits at the seams and several on top. However, I will say my son loves these boots and is disappointed that we can't send them back to the Easter bunny again."
5,Great little boot,"I bought these boots for my grandson and he just loves them. He loves having boots ""like a REAL fireman ! "" Very pleased with this product."
2,Fell apart in the cold,"CHANGING MY REVIEW: We loved them at first, but.... CAUTION: Do not expose these boots to cold temperatures. We left them outside one afternoon & the temp dropped overnight, resulting in frozen boots. The next day they literally FELL APART in chunks when our grandson put them on."
4,Fire boots,My son loves this item. He wears them all the time even during the rainy season. It is close to real as you can get. It goes well with the fabric style fire suit and the toy accessories.
1,I'd give zero stars if i could,"These are some of the most poorly made kids fire boots I have ever seen. My 3 year old is really into firemen. I bought these boots at Stride Rite so I assumed they would be durable. I couldnt not have been more wrong. Within a month the boots had split across the front just under the shield. Not one boot, but BOTH!! The split just continued to get larger. Despite the fact that he mostly wears these indoors, the soles began to wear through and within 3 months the sole had started to detach from the boot all together. I would NEVER EVER buy these boots again!"
1,Don't buy..heel broke after using few times,"We bought this late fall of last year. It was not used the whole winter and was used few times during spring for the occasional rainy days. I was shocked when my son came home from school with wet socks last week. THE BASE CAME APART. We have used many a rainy boots over the years, never had this problem. We had to go for new ones only because he outgrew his current ones. Here we go, now got to buy another pair. If I had bought from a store, would have definitely taken it to them and complained. On Amazon, I don't know if there is any customer service number that I can call."
3,firechief rain boots,"Very cute and fun. The pull on handles work great. The only negative is that they are a little short. So, when splashing in puddles, water goes in the boots."
4,"I like them, son loves them!","As the other reviews stated, these run large. The top fabric layer of the insoles also peeled out in both my boys' boots. However, my son LOVES them. He's been wearing them every day, for every occasion, for months. They're holding up just fine!"
2,I little unsure about 343,My son loves firemen. We saw these in the store and he had to have them. When we got home I realized they had the 343 on them. 343 is the number of firemen who died on 9/11. I think that is a very strange thing to put on a childs shoe. We live in New York City and have many friends who are in the FDNY. I am not so sure it is appropriate for my son to wear these boots. I just thought I would let people know what 343 means.
4,Good recreational reading for single parents.,"In a very personal way, I can relate to many of the events taking place in the lives of Bebe and her nemesis - Dash. Watching their friendship develop was heartwarming and Isaac oozes with so much potential that, it can only extinguish the friction between the two women in his life. Here's to Yolando Joe, an excellent entertainer."
4,aissatou@aol.com,"I really enjoyed this book. Although I did not like this author's previous works, I thought this one was a nice Summer read. Although, certain parts were rather unbelievably mushy in how certain things are dealt with and wrapped up, the format of alternate chapters for the characters, resembling Disappearing Acts worked! Loved how we got into the characters' heads. Also, liked the single African-American male parent. Rather refreshing new obstacle in a romantic novel. four thumbs up and here's hoping that this author gets better with each novel."
4,It took me three days to read it: I couldn't put it down.,"""Bebe's By Golly Wow"" was interesting because the characters Bebe, Sandy, Issac and Dash seemed so real. Yolanda Joe's writing was so vivid that I could see the characters and actually felt that I knew them as friends. I also liked how Bebe and Issac used music to solve their problems or help them to understand their relationship. I guess music, like books, can work wonders."
2,I Was Disappointed...,"I really wanted to give this book a try because I read ""He Say, She Say."" What a waste--I had to look at the back cover thirty times because I couldn't believe Ms. Joe is a Yale graduate. I don't want to hate on her, because I am an aspiring writer myself, but this book lacks intelligence, the slang is cliche, and the characters are stereotypes, to me. It seemed rushed."
1,Just plain awful!,"I read this book several weeks ago, and I'm still mad that I spent any time on it at all. This is one of the worst books I have read in years. I find it hard to believe that there could be such shallow people in the world as are portrayed by these characters. The title character is supposed to be a mature woman, yet she apparently spends nearly all her time thinking about CDs, cars, clothing, and other material things. It reminds me of what a not-very mature 12 year old girl would think an adult woman is like. Where is the soul in these people? I find it truly frightening if the average American reader is led to believe that this type of trivial, media-brainwashed pap is what the average black woman thinks and feels on an ongoing basis."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This got 5 stars??? I found this book to be so juvenille-- so insulting-- that i had a difficult time finishing it. Don't get me wrong- Yolanda Joe does have a story to tell. Unfortunately, she relies so heavily on hackneyed expressions, nonsense words and phrases (""fa-fa- fierce"") and ""urban slang"" that its difficult to determine what she's actually trying to say. Unfortunately, Joe's book is yet one more addition to the ""bubblegum"" black fiction genre."
1,Another disappointment,This is another in the long line of awful black novels that have been released this year which contribute to the over-all marginalization of black literary standards. Where was the editor in the creation of these books? It's a sin against the trees that had to die to print this stuff.
2,Hard to follow,"I started reading this book last week and I have already skipped several paragraphs. I am usually a fast reader, but this one is just really hard to read. The language is overly trivial and repetitive. I don't think I will be able to finish reading the book. I am sure it's a great story, but the language used made it too hard for me."
3,Pretty Good!,"This is the first book I read by Ms. Joe and it was good. I have heard that her book ""He Say/She Say"" is good, so I can't wait to read it."
3,entertaining and funny!,"I thought that this book was very funny, and realistic. I remembered the characters from Ms. Joe's previous novel, so I identified with them right away. The only thing that I didn't like was the language used by the main characters. With the exception of Dash, it seemed to be too juvenile to fit the age of the characters at times. All in all, it was cute, romantic and funny."
4,Very Entertaining,I found this book entertaining throughout and very well written. The author did an excellent job of keeping each character in their character through the entire book. It was refreshing to read a book where the brother wasn't an out of work cheat. Keeping it real.
4,"Fresh, Sassy and definitley unputdownable!","What can I say, I loved this book. Fast-paced the language was so apt. I couldn't put it down. The characters, and plot just jumped out at you, really vivid imagery. A real relaxing read that avoided over using the ""isms"" I could read this again, the fact that she can combine a number of sub-plots in one story succesfully without losing the thread is admirable. Not too mushy either. The only downside was it ended much too soon. I'm going to buy the other titles right now!"
4,MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST BOOK.,I ENJOYED THIS BOOK ALOT BETTER THAN THE FIRST. THE FIRST BOOK WAS RATHER SLOW. IN THIS ONE BEBE HAD MORE SPONK ABOUT HERSELF AND WASNT ASHAMED TO LET THE READER KNOW WHAT SHE WAS THINKING. IM GLAD Y.J. WROTE THE SECOND ONE TO GO ALONG WITH THE FIRST. BEBE HAS MORE FIRE THAN SANDY. IM SURELY A BEBE. I ENJOYED THIS READ.
5,"This book was a terrific sequel to He Say, She Say!","When I finished reading He Say, She Say , I just had to find Bebe's By Golly Wow. And I am so glad I did find and read it. Bebe is truly a trip! I like her a lot. Sometimes I wish that I had the wit and ""in your face"" attitude that she has. I would definitely recommend this book to all of my friends and family. Actually, I already have. I'm waiting for the next one to come out. Hopefully it will be soon!"
3,O.K.!!!,"This was my second time reading Yolanda Joe's work. I believe this one was somewhat better than He Say, She Say. Yolanda is improving!!! I especially liked the ending to this story, and I was happy that Bebe and Isaac found happiness with each other."
2,Wizcom quicklink pen 1000,"I rate this product 2-star because it wasn't easy to use. The shape was not correctly designed to scan text easily. The scanner was not as accurate as I would have expected. On the box, it claims that it is 97% accurate but I found that it was actually not that accurate. It has poor letter sensitivity. It also took a long time to read the text and process the text onto the screen. I expected it to work like a highliter but it wasn't true. I think that the price is exaggerated when you take all the reasons I listed. I think that this pen needs to have a few improvements to make it more accurate."
2,Not as good as C-Pen,"I've used both this and the C-Pen 600, and I found the C-Pen to be significantly better, mainly because the C-Pen has a much better user interface. As well as being more awkward to use than the C-Pen, the QuickLink is noticably larger. The QuickPen does have the advantage of having a serial port as well as the I/R interface. The QuickLink Pen is also a bit cheaper, as to get the equivalant functionality with a C-Pen you need a C-600, InfraRed adapter for your computer, and carrying case, all of which must be purchased separately."
1,"Device Fine, Software lousy","I found the scan effectiveness worthy of praise, but trying to get the content to my laptop unbearable. The software wouldn't install well or access the scanned text on my Win XP laptop, or my Win2000 laptop, and when I went to my old Win98 laptop it worked fine...albiet with a lame interface. And then, when I deleted the desktop software from Win98 system, the OS got smeared and now only fires up in ""Safe Mode"". Again, the optics work fine, no complaints at all, but the software is puke."
2,Worth about half it's price.,The accuracy on this thing is just pitiful. Especially when you can spend $30 more to get a very accurate handheld scanner from Iris.The portability is the only thing this scanner holds over the competition. But I can 'write' in the information on my PDA faster than getting this thing to scan correctly.
1,"Wiz- Com: Over- Hype, Under- Deliver","Wiz- Com was one of the 1st to come out w/ a handheld pen scanner, and the idea is great...The sell- point for me was convenience and the thought that I would be able to speed up processing data for school. Unfortunately, the software app. for this scanner sucked, the interface was a total pain in the a** to get functioning correctly, and text- editing was a nightmare. I ended up wasting more time trying to get it to work than it was worth. Total waste of my time and money.Save your $$$ and wait until better models come out in the future. This was a case of rushing a great idea to market before the technology was ready for consumer application."
2,Not a great product,"Hard to use. Difficult to hold, hard to edit text once you transfer it to your pc, cumbersome in general. Only buy it if you're tech savvy,"
5,Great Gift For Students!,"Although when I purchased this item for my husband, a Ph.D. student at Notre Dame, it only had 2 stars and a mostly negative review -- my husband has found it VERY easy to use and LOVES IT! It picks up all types of fonts, font sizes, and even lightly printed text. He has had no trouble with the transfer (of text from the scanner to his computer)and uses it often! I am glad I didn't listen to the negative review -- it seems to have been misleading."
3,More Practice?,I ordered this scanner to facilitate university research but during my initial use I found that it does not correctly scan English spellings. Some basic words were horribly mangled and it was a guessing game to determine the original wording. I am going to test further to determine if this is a glitch or a product weakness.
1,Great Idea - poor execution,I purchased the pen for my wife who is a law student. I have had the pen for 6 months and have been unable to get the pen to communicate (tranfer text) with my computers (laptop and desktop). I spent over 1 hour with tech support and they were unable to solve my problem. This would be a great product if it worked.
1,It stinks,The pen does its job scanning text. The difficultly is getting teh PEN to communicate with the PC or a PDA. It is not capable of communicating wiht the PC when your PDA or PPC is hooked up. It takes several hours of rebooting the system to get it to find the PEN.Buy the up-scale version!!
3,Enjoy!,"I received this pen for a gift. As I am not computer ""literate"" I did struggle with the installation. I called technical support and we were able to zip through all the steps and the pen was communicating with my PC well. I really enjoy the concept and it is working as stated on the box. I am looking forward to this tool getting through my masters program."
1,You get what you pay for!,"This will be my third warranty replacement - VERY DISATISFIED! - I bought the chaeper WIZCOM brand beacuse of that, look the same as the C pen and seem to work the same way. I was wrong, scanning [stinks] unless you go real slow... memory fills up quickly and sometimes shuts off by itself!True what they say you get what you pay for. No wonder they are giving a rebate now, trying to get rid of thewm I guess. Get yourself a known brand C pen or Reado they are most reliable and the best.Shipping this one back again...Grrr.!"
5,Strategic Selling,Great Service. I received the book within a few days of ordering it. I was in almost new condition. The price was worth it. Would buy from this vendor again.
5,Brazilian Business Executive,"Great book !! Although it is not new concept, it is still extremely valuable to business development executives. That makes me anxious to read the New Strategic Selling..."
5,Jill Jack - A Hidden Gem (but not for long),"I recently learned about Jill Jack during a sparsely-attended performance in Farmington Hills, MI. The size of the audience had no impact on the outcome. I was immediately impressed with Jill and her stage presence but more importantly, her music. Watch Over Me is the first CD I acquired (a wonderful gift) and I have found every song to be unique, yet very high quality. I have already ordered earlier works by Jill Jack and judging by the initial sound, I won't be disappointed. Jill is an artist on the brink of stardom and I really hope she continues to write and perform. The band provides tremendous musical support for all of Jill's talents. Watch Over Me is an outstanding CD that begs to be replayed again and again."
4,Track listing,TRACKS:1 Stirs My Soul2 Rosie3 Austin4 Lovin'5 Watch Over Me6 Summertime7 Holding Hour8 Don't Bring Me Down9 Nowhere Bound10 Colorado11 My Own Sin. Original 1997 issue.
4,MG Ex-S,"This gundam is huge, easily towering my other MGs and is almost the same height as some of my PGs (while it's on its stand) Oh yes, it does come with a stand, as it cannot stand on it's own two feet (this is because it wasn't meant to fight on land, only in space) It can convert to a vehicle mode, but I like to keep mine as a robot. Not much ways you can pose this guy, but it is very detailed and looks very nice."
5,Great story -- read it!,"This is an amazing and inspiring story of an incredible man of God. It is a quick read, page turner, wonder-how-will-he-get-out-of-this kind of book. Seriously consider reading when you need to be inspired to keep living by faith and working toward the goal. Have your teens read it to get them off the XBox and start living for God!"
5,This book should be required reading for every missionary.,"The most amazing account of true faith. Bruce Olson lives and teaches his faith in a way that respects the native cultures and traditions of the people he tries to reach. Consequently, the heart of Christianity is spread in a real and lasting way and a people group and region are changed forever."
5,Incredible book and story,"I will admit I am not a born again Christian nor am I particularly religious. However this book is beautiful, fascinating, gripping-- it needs to be made into a movie! I read it in a single day, I could not put it down."
5,Bruchko is Marvelous,"This incredible, true story shows you how God works in ways we cannot evenimagine. Bruce Olson's faith and courage made him the perfect missionaryfor the Motilone Indians and he listened to the Lord's call even when othersaround him told him he was crazy. If you have ever considered being amissionary, or even if you haven't, this is one book you won't want to miss."
5,Read this book. It'll change your life.,"Are you jaded, and cynical of all that you see around you in the lives of Christians? Do you hear a lot of talk and see little action? Then start by reading this book: it'll rattle your cage in the biggest way, and give you an example of relentlessly following Jesus' commission to all Christians.After you've read this, get a copy of the Self-Confrontation manual (by John Broger, published by the Biblical Counseling Foundation: (760) 773-2667) and go through it: its an excellent way to root out the many common sins of omission (not just the sin of omitting the Great Commission) and of commission. Then head for the ends of the earth.(And no: I don't have any affiliation with BCF, other than having benefitted greatly from their training.)"
3,Ultimately a Dissapointment,"An original tale, a compelling story, with an important message; sounds like a great book right? Well it should have been, but Bruchko just falls flat. Olson's writing style is awkward instead of inspiring. I read the book fairly quickly and other then Olson's poor writing I enjoyed it, but Olson's descriptions of both the people and places felt forced and unnatural. The style is clumsy and immature. I often felt as though I was reading a story written by the nave 19 year-old who first set off into the jungle, not the memoir of an intelligent adult. While it obvious he has an important story to tell it is just as obvious that he is not very good at telling it. For those interested in indigenous cultures or missions, the book is insightful, just don't expect Olson's delivery to whisk you away to the jungle."
2,The Man Just Can't Write,"It is an inspiring story of truly epic proportions. One problem though.Bruce Olsen couldn't write to save his life.I am no stranger to books such as this, I have read dozens and all of them are interesting in their own way, this by no means is the worst of the pack but I had heard such good things about it, probably the only reason I am giving this two stars instead of at least a weak three is because of the dissapointment I faced in comparison to what I had heard."
4,Euphoria Melts My Brain,"If you can find this one, be sure to pick it up. Excellent spacerock in the vein of Steve Hillage and Ozric Tentacles, this is probably ME's best album (also their first). The music is all instrumental, bass heavy but not throbbing like dance music. Filled with wordless female vocals, space whooshes, edgy guitar, Middle Eastern touches, ambient passages, and jazzy percussion, this is a feast for anyone who likes psychedelic music."
4,Good prog-psych effort from a forgotten band,"I recall one mid-week evening in the 1990s Haight-Ashbury, when Melting Euphoria was the closing act at a dreary bar (the Boomerang, I think). The opening band had attracted a large and lively crowd; but by the time Euphoria had set up their instruments, the entire place had emptied out. I was the only person left standing in front of the stage! Despite this, they gamely played a spacey one-hour set just for me and the bartenders. Their musicianship was excellent, and they reproduced the sound of this CD very well indeed. Too bad they never gained the audience they deserved."
5,The plight of the Black Freedom Fighter,"The book tells the story of the segregation of Black soldiers during world War II with humour, honesty and history.The book focuses on African American Soldiers from differnt exposures of life and their failures and successes as they navigate the land- mines of racism in an effort to fight for Democracy."
5,Monk Forever,I miss the intellegence of the writing and the capability of Tony Shaloub. Reruns are great - but we need something new.
2,Not a good one,"I always have relied on the EXAM CRAM series for certification, somehow this book is not good enough to get certified. Even though, the chapters are arranged according to SUN's exam objectives, author didn't concentrate on the core details.I looked into other book called 'SCWCD Exam Study Kit' published by Manning and had helped me in getting certification.I wouldn't recommend this book ..."
1,Horrible Text,"This work gave the impression of a first draft without any follow-up; a book that was rushed to the presses just so it could claim to be the first; and a book whose author, who has written other books that were much better, didn't seem interested in the book himself. Yes, when you write an ExamCram book, you are not suppose to delve into every detail; but completing a sentence should not be considered optional.Very disappointed; thank god for Amazon's return policy."
1,lots of errors,"a lot errors in this book, obviously no one proved read the book before publishing it. Shame on the publisher and author."
3,Tainted Love,"Classic. The original 'trance' music. I am riveted to disc 1, addicted is more like it. Don't care for discs 2 or 3, but #1 makes up for the price and I paid more than what you see here on Amazon. I give 5* for disc 1. If it can be worn out, I'm working on it. You can have the other two.Man, it really makes me feel old reading comments from teens who weren't even born when Soft Cell's Tainted Love first hit the dance floor via DJ's long play mix - true trance music. Digital remastering and club mix makes this even more enticing. As moving today in 1999 as it was twenty years ago.Today's alternative club/dance music is really a bunch of no-talents; can't sing, can't play and can't dance for people can't tell the difference. Don't quit your day jobs, kids."
4,GREAT GARMENT,"I bought 2 of these for myself.Good fit, washes very nicely.................LOVE THEM.Buying 4 more for Xmas gifts for my 2 brothers."
4,pirate pinata,A little smaller then I thought it would be but overall a good size. I bought this pinata for my sons 6th birthday and it was very durable. I had some older stronger boys who took a few swings at it too. It took a little while of hitting it until the kids got restless and i just ripped it open held a lot of candy and all went well
1,What a waste,"I was at the Manchester Concert, and I was expecting a bit more about it..... that's the only reasone I bought this DVD, but it skipped right over it. Not only that, it was really boring, the only song they showed in whole was Stan. Who wants to see Eminem driving and flying around Europe crying about everything he comes in contact with? That's all you get with this DVD... I'll sell it for 50 cents."
3,Eminem Conquers Europe,"If you thought Eminem was only known in the USA, you're really wrong. This is a polemic Eminem/D12/XZibit Tour in Europe. Eminem and his crew go to Hamburg (Germany), Oslo (Norway), Stockholm (Sweden), Amsterdam (Holland), Brussels (Belgium), Paris (France), Manchester and London (United Kingdom).Eminem sings The Way I Am with Marilyn Manson in Hamburg, B**** Please II with XZibit and Stan with Dido in London.The extras are:- Purple Pills: A live version of this D12 song, you can't find it nowhere else, I think.- Forgot About Dre: Featuring Dr. Dre.. A song from the 2001 Dr Dre's album... Can't find it anywhere else neither...Is it cool? Worth? Yes. It's a funny DVD, full of backstage things, in fact, this DVD is more backstage than live performance. So, if you're looking for an Eminem show, buy the Up In Smoke Tour DVD, because this is 80% backstage, 20% live performance. Was it helpful?"
1,Waste of Time,"What a disappointment! This DVD should be entitled 'D-12 All Across Europe.' Seeing behind the scenes was interesting but if I had wanted to see a travelogue of Europe I would have purchased a travel documentary. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Em' but what was the purpose of endless scenes of the concert crowds and waving hands? This DVD isn't worth taking the time to watch -- save your money."
3,A Fine DVD,"I'm an EMINEM fan, but I was waiting a little bit more of this DVD... OK, it has such as good backstage scenes, but I wanted live performances, and there are many few of them... Some like 4, 5 songs. It's not bad, definetly, and you should buy it if you are a rap fan, I mean, if you like EMINEM... I just got disappointed because of the few live performances. But these live performances presented at the DVD still rule. You should buy it, anyway..."
3,Good binoculars,"Even if they are an 16 x 32 FRP, they don't offer a good quality of watching they should be. Is very difficult to see throuh them."
5,Arthurian legend through story and song,"The legend of King Arthur is performed through the song cycle ""Tales of Camelot"". Voice (both in song and dramatic readings), guitar, pennywhistle, violin, harp, and percussion are featured in folk, Renaissance, and Celtic styles. Performance list includes:1. In Legend2. Camelot3. The Gift4. The Lady of the Lake5. The Hunt6. The White Stag7. Arthur's Champion8. Lancelot9. The King of Ireland's Daughter10. Tristan and Isolde11. The Vow of Sir Gawain12. The Holy Grail13. His Words are Leaves14. Green Man15. The Charm16. Merlin17. Nine Sisters18. Morgan Le Fay19. The Journey to Camelot20. Guinevere21. The Count of the Saxon Shore22. The Coming of the Night23. After the Battle24. The Death of Arthur25. Avalon"
5,Larsen's 2nd Best Work,"As a huge fan of Leaether Strip, I would have to say that this album, Legacy of Hate and Lust, is sonically brilliant. Showing loss, hurt, and over-all emotional break throughs (and break downs), the lyrics are his most penetrating. Track eight (listed as #9 here), ""I won't look back"" is my favorite Strip song to date. It is hard not to imagine the frustration on Claus's face towards the end of this amazing piece. The only other album to make me feel so complete by LS is Anal Cabaret. Both are definately worth picking up, and show his truly awesome talent. Brilliant work, Claus!"
3,Dorman coached longer at 1 college than any other.,"""Doc"" Dorman coached longer at one university than any other coach in football history. As a player/coach and then a coach, Dorman linked almost sixty years of Upper Iowa University football history. Dorman was a local resident when Upper Iowa played Coe College in 1893 and he remained an integral part of the college and college football for half a century. Breckner's account of the kindly dentist and coach is concise and well written. He provides an interesting look at small college football from the turn of the century to the turbulent 1960s. The biography, although hardly a critical analysis, is a good read for all football fans."
5,What a 'Wok'!,"I had no idea what I was getting when I made the purchase. The picture, while good, can not tell you everything.When I opened the box, it was delivered in, I was surprised and happily so. It seemed so much bigger than I had expected.I use it, mostly for just my own dining, but I find that I can cook for 1-2 more, without a problem.The book that was included has some good recipies in it, but then, go on the net and you can find soooooo many others to try.The one draw back I found, is the spatula. I wish it had come with a smaller version, rather than the chop sticks.It is easy to put together and just as easy to clean up."
3,"Works well, a few problems.","This wok is a lot of fun! Unfortunately, it does not come completely clean with washing. Oil leaves a sticky, seemingly permanent residue on the wok.Less of a problem and more of an annoyance is the loud metallic 'bang' noice the metal makes when it cools. It makes me jump every time!"
5,Brought me into the kitchen,"I am a newlywed in my 20s and just learning to cook. The wok is not only my favorite thing in the kitchen, but my husband's too. We've really shared some good times in the kitchen making stirfry, fried rice, fajita veggies, and more in it. We use ours 3-4 times a week and love it!"
4,The French conquest of Morocco at the turn of the century.,Porch focuses his story on the last grab at Africa from a European country (except Mussolini's grab at Ethiopia). The story resolves around a general named Lautrey nibbling away at the borders of a falling apart Morocco. The Sultan no longer commands the repect of his countrymen and the Eurpoean powers have set up their privileges in the country. France sets the conditions whereby the Colonial department can add Morocco as aprotectorate. I like Porch's writing style. This book focuses on Morocco similar to where The Scramble for Africa focuses on the colonial experience of all Africa.
4,the Conquest of Africa,The book was in good condition and was shipped relatively quickly after I purchased it. I haven't read it yet but according to a friend of mine it is an excellent book.
3,Misleading Title,With the title of Panama Canal By Cruise Ship I expected the book to primarily be about the Panama Canal and what you would see from the ship as well as features of the various cruise lines servicing the Canal. What I found was that the majority of the book described ports of call that your particular ship may or may not visit.
1,Panama cruise book,Not current info...I should have paid closer attn to when it was written and what kind of update was done.
3,Panama Canal Cruise tour book,"Great coverage of the history and structure of the Panama Canal itself and a great deal of information about cruise ships in general. However, I was disappointed in the coverage of the ports. I would have preferred more details."
4,MIL seemed to like it.,"Purchased this book for my mother-in-law. She seemed to like it. They are taking a trip there, so it made a good gift. Have not read the book myself."
1,Bad Chocolate,"Product arrived very quickly however, the condition of the chocolate was horrible.Every block I unwrapped looked like it had gone bad. It had a white film over it and some of the chocolate looked like it was eaten away at.Clearly, this was old chocolate (or chocolate that was not stored properly) even though the expiration date on the box is August 2012.It did not even melt properly. Had a greyish color to it.Definitely not something I would order again. Very disappointed."
2,Cheap :(,I actually bought these as smaller utensils for my kids. They are SUPER tiny. The plastic handles rust and even fell apart after 1 wash. Too bad b/c it was a good idea. I have the forks and spoons. The spoons are even tinier.
4,A philosopical perspective on trust,"This was admittedly a challenging read. It felt like a philosphy text. Their language is rich and wording is dense. I had to reread many sentences to digest them. However, it was worth the effort. The authors describe a very useful, integated, holistic perspective on trust. It would have helped to a have framed their view with a model that gave readers a more structured interpretation to more easily absorb their unique perspective.All in all, well worth the investment to read and understand."
1,Talks a lot says very little.,This book's contents could be summarized in one page. There is no plan articulated on how to build trust. The authors rehash over and over themes of how destructive distrust and blind trust are. The principal of this book is developing authentic trust but there are no directions on how to do so. This book is great for developing your vocabulary or learning how to b.s. like the pros.
4,Great modern religious fable/morality tale,"A great seredipitous find at the local library, only now apparently it's out of print. Bummer! (Actually ""unavailable indefinitely"" from the publisher. What does that mean?) Anyway, Peter the Abbot is about to close down his 1600 year old monastery. the powers that be are bringing ""rationalization"" to the desert. and he will, too, if he can only solve the spiritual crisis of Carol, who can't decide between sex and a bishopric, Tear-Sing the Sad, who's only looking for people to understand him, avoid Dalip, who only ""wants to help,"" get rid of the terrorists occupying the monastery, keep track of Constantine the Boy, who is lost in the mist of senile dementia, and. . . if he can only find a ladder. . .It's wry, funny, sad, horrifying, and uplifting in turns. One of those quirky stories that ends up haunting you long after you've read it."
4,"Great insight, good read.","My first reading of this book blew me away as it introduced to me concepts of Christian belief that I was not familiar with. What I really liked about this book is the humble, self critical nature of the Abbot who is not the usual wise figure commonly portrayed, but instead a real human being like me on a journey. He's just travelled a bit further. But it is the end of the book that stayed with me. It ends with a whimper, not a bang, but I think that is the way it should be. On second reading I still loved this book but the writing flaws became more apparent. ""Flaws"" is too harsh, more that the writing architecture was evident where a more experienced writer could have hidden them better. Still, definitely worth a read."
4,"Good Movie, Good SoundTrack","This was a great movie, and having the soundtrack compliments it nicely. Does anyone know that song near the end of the movie, some lyrics are ""Mother of punk, I wouldn't sell you for the..."" It plays in the background before that last party. Let me know if you know that song."
3,Not bad,"Alright, the movie was great, the soundtrack was really good but it was missing the Minor Threat song ""Look back and laugh"" It's weird, I like most the bands on the cd, just i wasn't very impressed."
4,For the person asking about the Eight Dollar Experiment,The Actual name of the group is Eight Buck Experiment and the address to find their cd's and records is http://www.bluemoonrecordings.com/
5,Great cd great movie,I love this cd its a great comp. I love the song by generation x kiss me deadly it is a very cool song. The movie starts about beating people up but thats not the point of the movie and it has a lot of stuff about poseurs i love the exploited song to and the fifi song mirror in the bathroom. The Ramones song is a punk classic nuff said about it. But i watched that movie and at the end when steevo and bob are listening to generation x i think that is me so i had to get the cd with that song.
4,Why 2 albums,"Well I bought what I though was this CD in 1998. But what the CD shop imported for me was Gothic Rock vol.2 . For some reason, the one has almoust all the song the other one has. But I wanted the CD for Midnight Configuration - No Limit. Now after 6 years 'n found the one I was looking for in the firs place. Love the older Gothic songs. I'm still waiting for my order..."
3,Okay for believers,"I am underwhelmed by the musicianship on most of this album. It strikes me as ironic that altho some of these songs capture the vocabulary of historic religious belief for their own rebel purpose, the quality of the songs is not such that they would much appeal to other than TruE GotH BeleiverS."
4,Great tv,The tv was exactly as presented on Amazon and works great. I am very happy with purchase and with the seller.
4,"Great soap, bad scent","This soap provides the best lather from any hard soap I have yet tried. Unfortunately I cannot come to terms with the scent, which is exactly the smell you get when you first walk into a cheap motel room. Think sex, sweat, grimy rug, cheap perfume, dust, and of course cigarette smoke. Not the smoke itself mind you, I would actually prefer that. This is the acrid scent of old, stale smoke that has coated every surface of our room in the Tabac Motel (hourly rates available) for the decade since it was last remodeled. And it stays on your face, doing unspeakable things to your aftershave for a good hour before it tires and goes away.But I still give it four stars because of the lather, the size, and the price."
4,Great soap and my wife loves the smell,"If you plan on buying your first Tabac shaving soap, do yourself a favor and buy the bowl with the soap. It's completely worth the price difference and you'll keep using it once you buy your second puck of Tabac. My wife loves the smell of this soap and it performs well.This soap is excellent and sits on the same level as Mitchell's wool fat shaving soap."
5,One Of The Best,"I will be brief. This product has many detailed reviews so I will just say this shave soap is the best I have come across. The lather, the scent and the lubrication are all first class. This will definitely be a repeat purchase for me. Try it and you will see."
5,Unbelievable Value,"This is really a beautiful watch, especially for the price. The depth and color to the mother of pearl was really amazing on the watch I received. Most retailers sell this watch for about $200, and at this price it's a decent deal - very classy and understated but with a lot of sparkle. At Amazon's price is really a pretty amazing value. Couldn't be happier."
5,Best food for small breed puppies!,We have a 14 week old silver dapple miniature dachshund (Sophie) that couldn't hold down any food. She was getting the runs and just plan out sickly. We picked up a bag of Fromm Puppy Gold and started feeding it at 100%. The next day she had the first firm stool we had ever seen! Sophie has now been on the food for about a month and we never plan on feeding her anything other than Fromm. It's a great food!!!!
1,Complete Rip-Off,"Very disappointing. This product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose. The ""high waist"" was always rolling down. I wasn't expecting miracles; I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight. This product was completely useless. Product has a clever name but that's it. I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item. Look elsewhere."
1,Total ripoff,"Given the name of the product and its price, I thought I'd get something that offered at least a little control, but it didn't even smooth out the appearance of cellulite on my thighs. It won't flatten your derriere because it won't flatten anything. The only promise it keeps is the waist and legs do not bind - they're not made strong enough to bind. The high waist kept sliding down, too; I had to tuck it under my bra to make it stay up. I bought this so I'd have a smooth look with the gown I wore to my daughter's wedding, and this garment was very disappointing. It was a waste of money. I've worn tummy control pantyhose that control better than Lipo in a Box."
4,LOVE IT!!!,"OK, I AM AN OVERWEIGHT PERSON WITH ALOT OF MY WEIGHT IN MY STOMACH AND BACK. I HAVE NEARLY TRIED EVERYTHING OUT THERE TO MAKE ME LOOK BETTER IN MY CLOTHES. I MUST SAY THAT THE FIRM CONTROL HIGH WAIST BRIEFS ARE GREAT. I DONT FEEL ALL SUCKED IN AND OUT OF BREATH LIKE SOME OTHER BRIEFS I HAVE. I AM NOT CONSTANTLY PULLING AT THEM ALL DAY. YOU CAN WEAR THIS EVERY DAY, I AM SERIOUS. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK BETTER IN YOUR CLOTHES GET THESE BRIEFS!"
3,"LOOKS GOOD, BUT (NO PUN INTENDED)....","The ""end"" product (so to speak) works, but it is very hard to get on and off and work with, if you know what I mean. I use it upon occasion, but would not add another to my wardrobe of undergarments."
5,Great product for the price.,I thought overall it was a pretty good product. It inflated in no time and my kids enjoyed it. I'd recommend it to anyone with small children.
3,Middlin' at best..,"Not Boker's best product. Made for the Magnum line of cheaper knives. This is a tool. Needs sharpening out of the bubble package. No sheath but I knew that before purchase. Hard plastic handle IS shaped well but the plastic being sooo effin' hard it is slick. Going to use as a bait knife for coastal fishing and I'm sure I'll be fighting big time rust issues. Keep oiled, vegetable or otherwise to prevent corrosion on blade. If I lose it I won't cry..."
2,Biased,"Though the book shows some promise in the first half, it becomes increasingly biased as it moves towards the Reformation. The auhtor is a congregational minister - no surprise.A better read would be Karl Keating's ""Catholicism and Fundamentalism"", Thomas Aquinas' ""Summa"", and The Catechism of the Catholic Church"""
2,OK in a pinch...Very tight,"I bought this as my second helmet. The internal sunglasses come in handy -- especially since the fit is so tight. I'm normally a ""Large"", so I ordered a Large. Feels like a medium. After 30 minutes of riding, the sides of my face hurt from the pressure. The chin strap is also too short and set too far back (or maybe that's a function of the helmet being too small for the stated size. Knowing what I know now, I would NOT buy it again. Now you know what I know."
5,Bulova Dress Watch,"I fell in love with the design of this watch and ordered it. The small size, the fact that it was a silver finish and the simple but elegant design of crystals was just what I needed for evening and special occasions. The fact that it is a Bulova watch assured me of the quality. Now that I have received it and worn it , I love it even more. The picture did not do it justice."
3,Beware ladies with small wrists,Love this watch. Looks very classy. Very disappointed when I had the watch band sized. The band is very stiff. The watch looks like it has a bangle band and is a little difficult to put on.
4,Good starting point for new listeners,"This CD is a good place to start for someone wanting to pick up an X Marks the Pedwalk release. It has both new and old material, representing the band's two musical styles.The first few songs on the cd are made up of newer material, featuring a less harsh vocal and musical style, with a more ""techno"" edge to the music. The later songs go back earlier in the groups career, where they were often times referred to as ""The German Skinny Puppy"". While they don't sound anything like Skinny Puppy, their earlier works have distorted vocals along with a harsher music style, a bit more industrial in nature.Either way, this disc is a great starting point to get a general overview what this band sounds like."
4,"Excellent,VERY rare recording of blues/rock","This band tore up the Dallas club scene in the early '90's, and this CD proves why. If I lost my copy, I would gladly pay the fifty bucks for a used one. Cricket Taylor sings like a seasoned blues crooner on every tune and her band is fantastic.Buy this rare recording today."
4,Chili pickle,"This reminded me how much I enjoy Indian pickle. It was basically good pickle.Problems:* it seemed a bit stale* it was fairly priceyBut it did remind me that I really like Indian pickle, and told me that I could get it on the internet, so I poked around a bit and found a place (ishopindia.com) in another suburb of Chicago which was closer (Skokie; I live in Oak Park) so instead of it coming from Texas, it came from Skokie (less than an hour's drive away). That solved the staleness problem. Their prices seemed to be about 2/3 of Amazon's prices. I thank Amazon for reminding me that I should look."
4,Defective Sound,"I have long owned the LP, which contains the first ten tracks, and loved it so much I wore it out long before I learned to convert to .mp3. So, I purchased this CD. It arrived, and when I played it, I found that tracks 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 11 had one or more defects. They sound like the needle skipping on an LP, or like the ""dropout"" you sometimes get in streaming audio when a packet or two of silence is inserted. This is really annoying, especially since you come to anticipate it. To try to perfect my album, I downloaded tracks 3 and 11 from Amazon.com as .mp3 files. You guessed it; they have the same defects ! I used GoldWave to remove the mute sections as best I could, but it was not always possible because the length was not always the same in both left and right channels. Perhaps not all the disks are defective, I don't know. But if you're a fan of ragtime, you must have this album, and I hope your're handy with an audio editor. Caveat emptor !"
4,the extraordinary travel,"show the book 30 extraordinary hotels is truly global in range. Urban or remote, historic .these hotels offers the priceless, unique experience from the Ice Hotel in Arctic Sweden where everything is carved from ice to the ordered tranquillity of the traditional Tawaraya Inn, Kyoto .and beautiful chateau romantic (de bagnols) and design the rogner- blumau hotel fanciful .extraordinary hotels is colorful tour through the rooms, lobbies and restaurants of 30 wonderful hotels and breathtaking and pictures , beautiful and wonderful.my favorites hotel , chateau ( bagnols,france) and the motu bora bora and the traditional Tawaraya Inn, Kyoto."
1,GemTwist #1,"Im very unhappy. When I bought this book, it was suppose to be new. They sent me a used book. A book that I paid 60.16 for, better look like its never been opened :( One never knows, what one will get, even on Amazon."
5,"Raw, grinding, industrial power!","The first RiB song I ever heard was off of the Wired Injections disc. The song was ""Cyberium (On Speed)."" From that point on, I was in search of anything with RiB on it, even remixes. Everything I've heard from them so far has been awesome. When I feel the need for some energy, I just listen to them. My favorites on the disc are probably ""Cyberium (On Speed),"" ""Just Let It Go,"" and ""What's Fair?"". The Endurance mix of ""Cyberium"" took some getting used to, but it's an interesting interpretation of the song, and definitely worth a listen. The ""Sintro"" at the beginning of the album gives a fair idea of what's to come....grinding metal, pounding drums, and basically industrial-sounding noises. I am still in search of anything and everything that has Razed in Black on it, because if I can manage to get a new RiB tune (or even a new remix), then it's a worthwhile purchase for me. I wanna see 'em live! 5 out of 5."
1,Rubbish Techno / Trance junk!,"If you like RIB's gothic stuff then forget this. It's a mess, a late arrival on a dead techno scene that peaked years ago. Any more albums like this the label should dump them. BAD, BAD, BAD from start to finish. Stick with Clan of Xymox, Switchblade Symphony, etc."
5,Calvin: A Life 1954,"Calvin: A Life was a great biography. It showed the reader what Calvin had to do in order to get to his triumphal days. It tells about the enemies of Calvin and what they were arguing against. When the book talked about what Calvin did during one year of work with the church, it amazed me. Calvin was one hard working man. It also tells about his death."
5,Hypnotic Stories,"These hypnotic, strange and poetic stories deal with the darker side of love. In each tale, Isabel Allende paints mini-portraits of men and women who suffer from the twin-disease of passion and obsession. These stories will haunt you long after you've finished reading this book."
2,2nd rate Allende,"Alas, while the book entitled ""Eva Luna"" was a well-written and interesting, the same cannot be said of the ""Stories"" which lack characters, plausibility, and even plot at times. Avoid this one."
4,And of Clay are we Created,"i read that short story in my lit class. i loved it. it caused me to read Eva Luna and it is also the reason that i have given this book 4 stars. thats how good And of Clay are we Created. i'm not sure if all the storys are worth it. its very erotic. and i don't remember most of them but i do remember liking quite a few of them. however , the best one is the last one."
2,Magical realism done badly,"Allende's book covers often gave me the impression that they were full of syrupy, sepia-toned impressions of Latin American life. I finally decided to read her when I found this book on bargain, though, and I can't say I my first impression was wrong. Unlike Marquez or Rushdie, she seems to insert elements of fantasy into her work just to be cute and fey. Her characters seem other-worldly in their simplicity. And the Latin America that her characters inhabit is a sanitized Eden a la ""Like Water for Chocolate"" rather than a complex, modern society a la ""Amores Perros."" If you like fairy tales for adults or if you care for sensual writing, you might like this. Otherwise stay away."
4,Splendid Short Stories from Isabel Allende,"Anyone in search of the some of the finest ""magical realism"" writing done by a fine Latin American writer will not be disappointed with Isabel Allende's short story collection ""The Stories of Eva Luna"". Whether she writes about abandoned women or American Indians trying to cope with modern Latin American civilization, her words convey much empathy and create moving, often emotionally stirring portraits of the people she describes. I can't single out one story and say that it is the best in the collection; all of them are splendid literary gems in their own right."
2,It does not work with need for speed PC game,It seems that this game pad was designed only for first personal shooting game. It is not for driving simulation games!!! I tried to follow the instrudction to configure it for several hours. But I have to admit that the feeling of all the buttons and sticks is very smooth.
2,Great until it breaks.,"My cousin and I both bought one of these several months back. The controller was the best I'd seen. The problem lies in a design flaw that you don't find until after several months of use. I was talking to my cousin and he told me his directional pad had broken off. I thought it was just a flue and that he'd been rough with his, but the same thing happened to mine about a month later. Apparently, the d-pad is held in place by thin plastic that gives way after awhile. Sad, considering it was such a great controller and now I'm limited to using the analog."
2,Neutral,"I dont want to be too harsh since the controller is not really bad, but since I bought it for a driving game and it didn't work its hard to say its good either. The size is a little chunky, compared to the Sony/PS2, I just didn't like the feel; the programming is vast,flexible and in depth-I'd prefer something more short and to the point. It allowed me to program the Dpad, the analog stick or the buttons to steer, none of them worked consistently or well. I'll never buy Saitek again but I suppose if you never drive with it its ok."
3,"Good Controller, Good Quality!","Looking for a controller for your pc gaming? How bout programmable? Saitek for the win!I have been using Saitek for a few months now and its been good. I like the programmable feature to make keyboard commends active on the controller. Easier for keyboard users. Only problem is the D-pad. Most of the games I play require the D-pad to use since it's simple. But due to it being made of plastic, makes it less desirable.Well it was worth the time it lasted. If you are an analog user. Prefer! If not...look for a more PS2/PS3 make, for the D-Pad feature."
2,Not the best,"This was a gift to a hardcore gamer who plays fighting games a lot, but after a few weeks of extreme-to-the-max fighting, the D-pad snapped off. You see, the whole thing was mounted on a thin plastic stud that does not tolerate a button-masher.The buttons are also an issue. They have a solid tactile response. However, they take more energy to push than the buttons on quality controllers. This may not be noticeable with slow-down-and-think type of games, but it is very inconvenient in fast-paced fighting games.The blue light looks awesome, but the now-missing D-pad makes it look bad.To sum it up, it works, it is compatible with Windows XP, and it looks cool; OK for casual gamers, but hard-core gamers will want something better.For the record, I didn't buy it at Amazon, but it's the same thing."
1,very disappointed here too,"Bought this device and had high hope to play many different audio and video file formats. Turned out, it can only play .avi file and nothing else. Even regular mp3 music files cannot be recognized by the player. I check the Coby website and there are nothing to support this device, not a manual, not a firmware, absolutely nothing. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't waste your money,"I generally do not review products but this copy needs an alert to consumers. Does not record most videos and when it does the picture quality is grainy. Will not read a picture that has over 8gb. As MP3 player, it is ok but why spend so much for a bulky Mp3 player when you can buy one less that 30 bucks. I own one and willing to give it away if recepient will pay for shipping. Useless useless useless. Buyer be aware."
2,Didn't come refridgerated,"So this is bacteria, expensive bacteria. When the pharmacy orders it, it comes with ice packs. Why didn't it come with an ice pack? How much bacteria is alive after how many days in transit with the postal service? I even paid extra to have it shipped faster, thinking the ice might not be melted by the time it got here. Thank goodness I ordered the pills and not the yogurt. I'm wondering if any bacteria is even alive by the time it reached me."
4,A Portent of Wonderful Things To Come,"This early entry in the long string of consistently fine recordings by the Brothers Adderley (alto saxophonist Cannonball and trumpeter/cornetist Nat) is well worth owning. It's all here already: the fiery inventive playing, the sharp swinging compositions. Able support is provided by Junior Mance, piano, Sam Jones, bass, and Jimmy Cobb drums."
4,Belvedere Dryer Part: Timer,Perfect Replacement part for my wife's hair-dryerWorks good and her hair-dryer is up and running again.Price was very reasonable.
4,Good program for older folks,"This is a well produced exercise program for older people. Navigation thru various segments, however is a bit of a challenge"
4,"Lovely, lovely","I love these shoes! I have a thing for red shoes and these are great. They have paid for themselves in compliments already. They are not the best walking shoe, but great for outfits that don't require a lot of walking around. They are even cuter in person than in the picture. A must for the summer season!"
5,Tasco 12x32 binoculars,Very nice binoculars for the price. Imaging is crystal clear and really easy to adjust focus. Provides a nice field of view. Comes with a compact carrying case thats hangs on your belt.
4,Check this band out....,"Silent Poets are almost completely unknown over here, which i find almost criminal. although this isn't their best work (that would be To Come or For Nothing), it is still a beautiful score to what I assume was Issey Miyake's fashion show. it showcases ambient versions of a couple of SP's classics (Someday, Talk Is Toy). The book that accompanies is very nice, showcasing some of Miyake's creations that are very much eye candy. Check out the proper Japan import versions of To Come (don't get the version which has a red cover, they're just remixes) for their best material."
5,Silent Poets,"You would have to love Issey Miyake, or be one of us intense visual vampires to treasure this volume. It is a free insider journey into one of his runway shows via the minds eye. ""Silent Poets""? Are not we all? But Miyake makes his poetry visual and this book abounds with breathtakeing closeups of inventive fashion statements of intricate ancient Indian surface design, merry go round Victorian three dimensional shapes for dresses, ballet slippered feet on worn stone steps, until, the repetative soft pulsing of the enclosed cd whisks you off into a far far more beautiful world."
3,Info on this Missing Video from the Chimpmunk Video Library Series,"I imagine that if you're on this page you already appreciate the Chipmunk Video Series. So this is more of an info than a review on this video, These are becoming some hard to find videos.

5,A Welcome Re-Issue,"This is my all-time favorite fusion album and I'd gone so far as CDRing my LP, I wanted it so bad. Needless to say, I'm thrilled it's finally out!Go see these guys live if you have a chance. They're fabulous."
2,A picture book,This is not for someone who is interested in actual people's stories. It's just a picture book -- it opens the door to Sing Sing but doesn't invite us in. Disappointing.
2,Minimal Author Input,I kept waiting for the author to flesh out the stories but it didn't happen. The material from the archives was interesting but it needed some depth...
3,Inside the past: a look at the future,"An interesting book at what death row was like in the state of New Y ork up till 1963. It's not the greatest on indepth commentary but the photos are very haunting and it is interesting to see the different types of people that went to the electric chair. The pictures themselves tell a story from the pathetic of two asians away from their homeland and family to the thugs of murder inc. If you're looking for content try Among the Lowest of the Dead by David Von Drehle, but for light reading this is okay."
