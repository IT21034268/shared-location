1,Winn Leather Fanny Pack,Zippers on pocket nearest to glasses compartment came off after only using it for a month. I would not waste money on this product.
4,Works well,"Nice package of qualities for a fanny pack. The leather is a bit stiff, and it has no pocket for a cell phone. The glasses case is very handy, and the other pockets hold a surprising amount of things. Beautiful, nice-looking brown leather."
2,"Cheap fabric, Large around the waist, pack itself SMALL","My husband has used various packs like this for years so we have an understanding of what is out there. I was expecting decent quality leather and a LARGE storage area. In fact, the only thing large about it, is the band that goes around the waist."
3,"Good Design, not durable","I have had this bag for almost two years. It is a nice looking leather bag and very functional. I have used it for overseas travel and everyday as a purse. I purchased the brown which is not a red as in the photo, but a nice colour. The large compartment is large enough for wallet, cell phone, passport, and things my kids want me to carry. The middle compartment has a change purse and it was great to have an extra change purse for a second currency. The glasses case was very useful as I could carry a pair of glasses in the main compartment (in a glasses case) and in the outer glasses case. My two children and I wear glasses so this was very handy. Unfortunately the waist band would not stay tight and this worsened over time. In the last six months the bag has started falling apart. The lining is very frayed, a zipper is broken and so forth. So, it was exactly what I needed but I am disappointed in the quality."
3,Old and broken,"It is a really good book, but we got it used, and it is very old and broken . Kind of disappointed. But my kid loves kipper, she still played this book for a while."
4,"Good book, but too fragile for little hands","I love the story, and Kipper is a big hit in our house, but my kids want to pull and lift all of the things that get pulled and lifted and they end up ripping pieces out of the book. If it was made of stronger material I would give it 5 stars, otherwise, it might be best for slightly older kids (3+) who know how to be gentle with books."
3,Good in a FROGS kinda way,"This movie was for sale at my local video store.I thought, ""well, the cover's kinda cool"", so I bought it. After I was done watching it later that day, I realized that this is a great B-movie! The plot you ask? This old dude named Snakey Bender's job is to capture poisonous snakes for research at the nearby college. When Snakey's(human)friends start to forget about him and move on with their lives, Snakey gets mad. One-by-one, he captures his ex-pals and tortures them in rather disturbing ways with his snakes. He then pushes their cars with the bodies in them off of a cliff. Sounds good, right? I say, rent first, except if you're a B-movie collector looking for a new addition. Might I also reccomend Frogs, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2."
2,"Rhinoskin Creative Labs Zen Micro, Silicone Case",I purchased this product because of the belt clip and it broke after seven months of use. Now I have a case with no belt clip.
5,Beautiful music,Fortunately I have the 2 record set. I especially love Sir Charles Thompson's sensitive piano. Minimalist but so effective. I play it time and again and never tire of it.
3,not real helpful,"I didn't really use it a whole lot. Tried to but it just confused me, borrowed someone else's Spanish dictionary."
4,Great for students,This dictionary is great for upper division college students who need a spanish language dictionary to carry to and from school. It has a lot of words and is conveniently sized. The print is somewhat small.
5,Diccionario Larousse del Español Moderno,"Excelent - la versión perfecta para los que les interesa hablar correctamente en su propio idioma. No cuesta mucho, y te ayuda muchísimo."
2,Wish I Had Noticed Earlier,"After this product arrived I noticed that I am missing one letter section and another was printed twice. Whether I received a misprint or if this happened to all copies I am not sure. I will be looking to see if I can still return the book and get another. If you decide to buy this product I would take care to thoroughly make sure all sections are there. Otherwise, it's pretty decent and is helpful to have when studying Spanish."
3,need some more,"The dictionary is fine for someone that does not speak spanish... it contains main words commonlu used. Is not heavy at all so it is easily portable...... for the price I paid, it is ok to have around but I am seeking a dictionary with a wider arrange of hypercultisms and less common words.Good for beginers!"
3,"good , but could have been better","Drawbacks: The print is very small, so it is rather hard to read it in artificial light. There are some circular explanations."
4,A Spanish-only dictionary for the rest of us,"My wife (from Monterrey, Mexico) and I (from Dallas, Texas) needed a Spanish-only dictionary. I have an excellent Spanish-English dictionary (the American Heritage), but that didn't work too well for her, and I had progressed far enough that I needed one that didn't refer back to English. I first bought her a piece of junk (the Diccionario Practico De La Lengua Espanola Del Nuevo Mundo); nothing we looked up was already there! It became quite clear to us that this was the most fundamental dictionary; anyone who spoke Spanish didn't need it.Fortunately, this dictionary saved us. While still not as extensive as we might like, it's comprehensive enough that nearly everything we look up is in there. I'm still looking for the truly comprehensive Spanish dictionary she wants, but this is quite serviceable."
4,Useful for advanced Spanish students,"It was suggested to me by a Hispanic Studies professor that I pick up an all-Spanish dictionary. I wanted one light and portable enough to take to class. This one fit the bill. It has thousands of words, and the definitions are not so complicated that I have to resort to using my Spanish-English dictionary. A worthy purchase for your dictionary collection."
4,Spanish-Spanish dictionary,My granddaughter is taking advanced Spanish as an adult after living in Spain for a while. Her teacher insisted on this book and it is carried in her book bag as it is just the right size and very helpful
2,"Tiny, tiny print - nececita buenos ojos","Well, I guess my title says it all. I needed a magnifying glass to read it, so I cannot comment on the contents. Melita"
3,Tiny print and yellowed pages,"Athough the book is old and the print is tiny, the information is accurate and useable for my purposes."
5,Nice convenient size,"I bought a used one and I didn't ask how old it was. It was printed in 1984 so there are probably a lot of newer words that are not in my edition, but I still think I will get a lot of use out of it and enjoy it. The print is rather small so for those that need reading glasses or are about to you may want to check that out in person before buying."
4,A Witches' Bible,This book is very well written but not what I expected. It would be great for those who either belong to a coven or are wanting to join one. I am a solitary so there is more information than I will ever use or need.EileenDalla
3,"Classic, but outdated.","This book is a must read for wiccans, witches and pagans. I don't doubt that for a moment. However the material is outdated and the factual information on the history and practices are no longer valid as much of it has been disproven.The authors wrote this book at a time when there was little else available, they filled a niche, but the time has come to look beyond the obvious and seek for those little gems in the ever increasing market of books on the subject of witchcraft and wicca.Personally, I prefer books like Magick Without Peers (Ariadne Rainbird), Circle of Fire (David Rankine) and Triumph of the Moon (Prof. Hutton) for my own purposes. Great as A Witches' Bible was once a upon a time, we need to be realistic and accept that it is time to move on!"
4,A good reference for Gardnerian/Alexandrian Wicca,While this book does not live up to it's title it is certainly one of the foremost references for those interested in the practices of a Gardnerian/Alexandrian coven.While somewhat dated in it's concepts it is still a useful resource for rituals and information on the Sabbats.Not a book for solitary practitioners and certainly not for beginners this book nonetheless deserves a place on the shelf of anyone who has a serious interest in Wicca.
4,A Wiches Bible,"This book contains a lot of useful information about Wicca and many rituals and ceremonies. It is based on the Gardnerian Tradition, but there is useful information for all Wiccans. This book is not really for beginners, but it is worth having in your collection of books. I would recommend this book, if you are in need of a good reference book for ceremonies and rituals, which it does include."
5,"""Bible"" is Just the Name of It","""The Witches' Bible"" is one of my favorite books. No, it is not a bible. Witches do not have bibles, it is a combination of 2 really good books, put into one. It has a lot of information and that is why they call it a ""bible"". Someone else wrote that the reason they didn't like it, was because it didn't have any spells in it. Witchcraft is a religion. It is not all about spells. If you are just looking for spells, then you're right, don't read this book. If you like a book that has a lot of information about what real witches do, then read this book. It has beautiful rituals, and a lot of very good information. It is a book that emphasizes the Gardnerian tradition, and every witch should own it and read up on all the different traditions."
1,"if you like imbalance, this is your book","This book is more of a platform for the feminist movement than it should be - it uses religion as a vehicle to speak this point. The general tone of the book is 'female and male are equal, but the female is more equal than the male' - WHAT? If you are a practitioner of wicca or witchcraft, than you know that there is total equality, not reverse sexism. I found the book useless."
2,"It says ""Witches Bible"", but it's not","I tought this book by it's title meant that I would find anything on spells, cast or whatever, but it wasn't the case.There's a lot of details on witches, the historic of it and how they do rituels, but none on how to cast a spell or how to write one or so. Though in the book they say that most people are interested in spells, they don't give you any information. They only explain basic fact of what is a good spell and what is a bad one. You know the kind you not suppose to use agains others...So, if your interested in history and want to know more about witches and how they do rituels, GO BUY the book, if not, DON'T BOTHER, because at the end,you'll just wonder if you can return it..."
2,very bland,"i love reading wiccan books and i have to say this one is not one of my favorites. it is very hard to find things. boring language. im sure their is lots of information in it, but it is so boring i usually give up."
1,Awful reading,"The writing is very dull. I must agree with the other comment that the pictures give you a creepy satanic feel. I have been involved with Wicca for 2 years and this book has a totally different feel from the Wicca I have been introduced too. It left me with a ""somethings not right here"" feeling. I WOULD NOT recommend this book to anyone -new to the craft or old. The title was grossly picked in error and an insult to other Wiccans."
3,A Great Book. One Of The Best,"This book is one of the best out there. If you are really new to Wicca, you might be better off reading Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft first, but don't forget to add this to your list. It covers everthing. I would have given it 5 stars but they are very anti-gay. No! Americans did not create gay covens. They have been throughout history. Anyone who study it could point out many excamples. That said, this book is a must have."
4,Is this book what you need?,This book is useful. It is full of sabbat information and ritual concerning each. Gardnerian in practices. Not for those with a small vocabulary. i would not make this my 'bible' but i have adapted plenty for my BOS. Also written ifor coven use but dont be afraid to adapt.
2,Of Historical Interest Only....,"No, it's not ""fluffy-bunny"", but it's woefully out of date! Offensive in parts, high-handed in others. It's still part of the history of Wicca, and a good thing to read for the serious student. Just be sure to read other sources and views! This is CERTAINLY not the ""Bible""!"
5,Pruchased for my mother!,And she loved it! She has been wanting to get into the craft for ages and I urchased this book for her and she hasn't put it down yet!
5,Witches' Bible,"The book was in excellent condition upon arrival. As far as the content, I suggest that a person research the title thoroughly prior to ordering. This is a difficult read but well worth it. This is only for those who are serious about the study of witchcraft/Wicca.There are some pictures within the book that I would not suggest for youth audiences."
4,A must buy!,"This is a great book, that allows a solitary eclectic take a peek at how more traditional covens are run.The info is helpful, if not figurtivley, then historically. The Rites are designed for covens, but you can adjust them.There's a great section on self-initiation that I wish every pagan could read.They have a very straightforward style, I liked it, but it won't be for everyone's taste.The reading can be a bit dull, or seem dated, but compare this to other bible's, and you'll see how much easier it is to read.If you are serious abot learning witchcraft or wicca, this is a must have. If you aren't sure, just ""dabbling"", or would only to read sweet fluffy things with no meaning behind them, don't waste you money.I give it an A-."
5,This is the definitive book on witchcraft,"For those looking for true, factual information on witchcraft, this is the book. Put all those other Wicca 101 books down. This is real witchcraft presented by real witches."
5,One of the best,"I've been doing the craft for decades and this is one of the best sources of information for getting the job done. For me it's what Joy of Cooking (and Joy of Sex) is for a lot of amateur plebes out there. It's probably a bit much for the beginner, though. But it's worth the struggle if you're in the craft for real. As far as bibles go, it's the ONLY one you'll ever need."
4,A Witches' Bible,"This book is alittle on the dry side for my taste, but it's still none the less good reads, and helpful just the same. I enjoy this book overall I rate this book 4 stars. Happy Reading!"
3,A Witch's Bible,"This book is very well written, and full of information. I especially found the history of the sabbatts very intersting. But it is so full of knowledge that it sometimes looses your interest."
5,Can't wait to get into this book,"I've never practiced Witchcraft, but it has always interested me, so when I came across this book, I couldn't help but order it. I can't wait to get into this book to start reading it. From reading some of the other reviews, this definitely seems like it will be an interesting read."
2,Narrowminded,"This book does give a lot of detail for anyone interested in the ritual and tradition of Gardnerian Wicca. However it is painfully narrow minded regarding ritual and places huge emphasis on male - female polarity in working, making this book totally useless to those who have a same sex working partner, or who work alone. It also takes an insulting tone towards those who think or do things differently.As I see it, unless you are straight, work in a coven, and a strictly Gardnerian coven, forget it. if you meet all of those criteria, youll more than likely find it quite useful, but then again, the coven could teach you it all anyway... kinda pointless really."
4,Not for Beginners,Great book as a reference. Lots of great infomation and knowledge that every Witch should have.
3,To much words.......Just get the point!!,"This is well written but, would be difficult for a newbie to understand, as well as the fact that its written as someone's opinion based on how they run their own covenient. this book is also way to wordy, you loose the main point in all the personal opinions."
1,This book SUCKS,"I HATED this book. It is horrible as an introduction to wicca or witchcraft. This book left me scared. It has funky pictures of naked people from the 70s doing wierd satanic-looking things. This book reminds me of articles about Anton LeVey without the kitsch. I do not recommend this book to anybody, and especially urge people new to the craft to stay away from this book. It freaked me out."
1,"This book totally stunk, and didn't have any info.","This was way to complicated, and as great as it may seem, this ""bible"" is a waste of all your money. Don't buy it. Loaded with useless facts, it goes so deeply in all the wrong facts about witches that you don't know where you are anymore. Also, the pictures included are useless as well as lame."
1,naked is a bit too much,"If you have never investigated alternative ""religions"" then maybe you might get some information. Heed care with what you take as acceptable and what is cult mumbo jumbo. Running around in the woods,in the dark, naked, is usually reserved for the, well, the cookoo."
3,"Interesting, but not for everyone.","While this book is very well-written and interesting to read, I do have to say that if it had been the first book I had read on the subject of practicing Wicca, I would have been hopelessly turned away. Not turned off, but just left with the feeling that ""There's no way I can do this if THIS is what I need to do!""This book is largely based on the authors' personal experiences with their own coven, and it should be read as such. If the solitary practitioner with no access to a coven keeps that in mind, and uses the book to gain valuable history behind the Sabbats and a peek into how a full coven might hold ritual in order to enrich his or her own experiences, then it is a good book for that purpose."
4,A very good complete book for one who has been on the path..,"I made the mistake and bought this when I was first beginning. The book confused me, but it was my own fault. The more I study Wicca, the more the book is useful to me. It is well written and worth buying."
5,Rogna: This Book is a *Must Have*!,"When I first started learning about the craft I had purchased books by several different authors. I am glad I read Cunningham's ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" first, because when I started to thumb through ""A Witches' Bible: The Complete Witches Handbook"", I was overwhelmed. Now that I have become more aware of the craft in which I believe is the only *way* for me, I was ready to read ""A Witches' Bible: The Complete Witches Handbook"". It is a must have.As you read the mixed reviews on this book you will read of some of whom say it is a dated piece of work. If that is true, and our religion is evolving, this book should be considered valuable for the historical beginnings of our craft.Other reviewers will state that it is ""Right On"" the mark. If that is true, it is indeed a mighty piece of work.I think it is an awesome book. It should be on every witch's/pagan's bookshelf."
2,Not so sure,It was hard for me to get into the book. I much prefer Buckland's books on Witchcraft. This seems outdated.
4,confusing index,I'm not really into British Traditional Wicca but I learned a lot about Wicca by reading and studying this book. Really in deepth older coven type rights and instructions.
3,Not bad..,A Witches' Bible has a wealth of information that's very useful but the book is hard to understand and poorly organized. Hard to find or understand what you're searching for..
5,Witches don't really have a bible,"I was shocked to see the title of this book. Witches just don't have a bible. They have book of shadows, spellbooks, gardening books, almanacs and so on. So I bought this book. It's a good book, except for the title which is very misleading and untrue. Why Janet Farrer calls her book this is anyone's guess."
4,Informative,The Witches Bible has been instrumental in helping us learn how to construct the sabbats observed when compared with other rituals in other traditions.
3,We get the point.,"People, stop beating up on this person because of the name. OBVIOUSLY its not a Bible, because noting related to the craft or anything is going to be a Bible. Consider the above review saying Bible only means ""book"". And if you're thick enough to be mislead by something saying Witche's Bible (which is an oxymoron), you're just not qualified to write a helpful review on this book."
3,Skeptical,"Maybe it's just the religious skeptic in me, but I couldn't really get into this. The book starts off explaining some of the history/technical aspects of Wicca. Then, it goes into the Sabbats and describes, in full detail, the ceremonies involved. I found these rituals to be more than a little hokey, and I apologize to anyone reading this who takes offense. The book also deals with the philosophy of the religion, which I found to be far more involving and informative. While I agree with the stance and moral position of the Wiccan religion, I can't see myself conducting these rituals alone, in the dark, nude, and trying to light my candles while the wind blows in from the east. If, however, you're still interested in buying this book and conducting these rites, then by all means, buy this book. You probably won't be disappointed. I just wish I could say the same for me..."
5,A very good work,"Upon hearing of Mr.Farrar's death a month or so ago I read every book I could find by these two fine Witches. I have to say if I would have read their books when I first started it would have sped my training up greatly! May Our Lady bless Janet in these sad times, and embrace her beloved husband Stewart. Blessed Be!"
5,Required reading for the knowledgeable Witch,"An excellent compendium of Alexandrian/Gardnerian Wiccan rituals, philosophy, and lore. Includes a large portion of Gardner's Book of Shadows. Best of all, the Farrrars recount historical and amusing anecdotal bits about the evolution of the modern-day Craft. However, newbies and sceptics beware: some of the information is presented as ""dogmatic"" (for example, the requirement of working skyclad, female-to-male-to-female transmission of knowledge, et. al.) If you are at all interested in Wicca, this book is a valuable resource on many levels."
2,Hmmm...,"The book is only really any good for those involved in Alexandrian or other traditional witchcraft- I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a beginner's guide. I was quite disappointed and in fact offended by their courteous mention of homosexuality and gay spirituality. They say at the start of that particular paragraph (which can be found by looking in the index) that they do not know enough about gay spirituality to talk about it and then go on to mention it and come out with an awful lot of out dated age old bigotry with the statement of 'some of our best friends are gay' (why are they telling me the reader that?) and the comparison of gay spirituality and 'normal' [sic] heterosexual ritual. I was not impressed and I don't think I want to read anything of theirs again. If you're European, heterosexual and interested in more traditional witchcraft, then the book is a must have, but otherwise explore something a bit more up to date."
3,Not for beginners or solitary witches.,This book is full of lots of information. If you are looking to practice in a covent this book is for you. Pretty complex and not for solitary witches.
2,Okay,"Great condition just not what I thought it would be, It is for the way more advanced and coven driven worship"
5,THE Book on Wicca,"This volume is the best Wiccan resource I've found yet. It clearly explains the basic Wiccan beliefs such as theories of levels and polarity, outlines all the Sabbats, rituals...everything in one!"
1,Witch bible,It was nowhere near what I was expecting. Had I done my research better I would not have bought this. More like hippies from the dark weird sex side or something.
5,Best of the Best,"I've been consulting for 30+ years and find the concepts in this book refreshing. In fact, the problem with most scorecards is that they miss the linkages that Dr. Schiemann and Dr. Lingle address in this book: People, Culture and Discipline.I especially like the detailed evalution of important linkages to make measurements work. These authors write clearly and succinctly with real case studies, not theory.Use this book as a reference guide of what to do when Norton and Kaplan fails."
4,For Nostalgia Buffs like Me,I have long been John Williams fan and this is a remarkable piece of music history.
5,A Simple Favorite,"I have fond memories of this book as a child, so I wanted to share it with my three year old daughter. To my surprise, it was not quite as interesting to me now as it was in my memories. My daughter loves it, however, and we read it together often! It is a simple story of a mess being cleaned up, and maybe that simplicity is what appeals to her."
3,Not up to par,"My 4-year-old and I both adore Virginia Lee Burton's books. Neither of us can get enough of ""Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel,"" and ""The Little House."" So we were excited when we ordered this from Amazon. But it lacks the magic of the aforementioned books. There is no ""human element"" as in the other two books and it lacks the drama. The plot is relatively mundane - you can only get so much mileage out of snow plowing city streets. Having said that, the illustrations, as in her other books, are beautiful. I particularly like touches such as little vignettes around the border of the pages, and a great map of the town. Against other children books, it's still very good, if only for the artwork. In fairness, Burton set the bar pretty high for herself with her other books.(This review pertains to the Library Binding version of the book)"
4,My son loves Virginia Burton's books,"I ordered this book for my son for his 7th b'day. He loves anything to do with transportation, and discovered Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel first. He checked that book out of the school library every week for more than a month, then I helped him find Katy and the Big Snow, and he loved it just as much. I remember enjoying these books when I was a child, and I think it is wonderful that books like these still bring enjoyment to the children today."
3,katy and the big snow,"I would have liked to have known that this would have been ideal for a baby, with the thick cardboard pages as opposed to what I thought I was ordering was the regular children's book with regular paper pages. My grandson is too old for the cardboard baby book."
5,great read for a toddler,the author who is also the illustrator has written many books all great for toddlers and young adults. this particular story wears well as the pictures paint the story while the book is being read. a must for real young libraries.
4,Great book,My Son loves this book almost as much as he loves his Mike Mulligan book. Great buy for someone who's children love trucks and reading.
1,Very disappointed!!!,"This book was my 1st Kindle ebook purchase after many successful purchases at Barnes & Noble. I have the kindle app for my iPad. I am completely disappointed! The graphics are terrible! If I had wanted a poorly scanned PDF whose pages didn't line up, I could have saved myself the $$ and foraged at the local used bookstore and probably found a better quality product. I am very hesitant to purchase any other children's books for fear of the same result."
1,just enough text for the littlest listener!,"Wonderful reading experience for the youngest of children, from an author whose work are classics! The board book is easy to handle, colors are vibrant and story incorporates familiar objects and experiences."
4,Enjoyable story teaches good values,"My 3-year-old daughter likes the story of Katy, which we read before bed, and I like that it's a story where the underlying assumption is that hard work helping people makes you happy. The illustrations are creative, and clearly a lot of effort went into planning out the town, with lots of nice little touches in the details."
5,good fun mystery mind challenger,"We picked this book up at a book swap and have thoroughly enjoyed reading and rereading the book. The author's creativity is apparent on each page. However, our copy does not reveal the final clues because a prior owner tore the last page out. So, we're ordering a copy from Amazon.com so we can finally get some sleep."
5,"Love Pop Up Books, Smyth's are the Best","I have purchased this book and others from Smyth when my kids were little. We all loved the book. We gave one to my young nephew. Now, he wants a copy of each title by Ian Smyth. He loves them too. It's pop up, it's detective work, it's fun, it's surprise, and they have to read it to be able to solve it. What a creative author."
3,Physics' Kid,"I am a student in high school and our physics teacher told us we could buy one of these to keep. The one I borrowed from him was so cool, that I thought might like to have it become a permanent fixture on my desk. However, the bird I bought kept falling backwards. I brought it to my physics teacher who fixed it by putting a weight on the beak (a paperclip weight). He told me that the head was put on backwards. This is not really a toy. It is breakable and the liquid inside the bird stains clothing but once it gets to proper working conditions, it is very fun to watch. It's like a thought stimulator."
4,funny,"I this as a gift to an engineer, so how the mechanics completely caught his interest! he keeps it on his desk!"
3,Not Like You Think,"While I had fond memories of this product, and was thrilled when my 12-year-old daughter asked for it for Christmas, the actual experience of what we received was disappointing for both of us. The birds are difficult to maneuver into just the right position so they begin to work. Frustrating for the 12-year-old, too. Also, WARNING, one of the birds somehow developed a leak and made a significant stain on my Corian countertop which had to be scrubbed with Steel Wool to remove. We did finally get one to work - sorta - but wasn't worth all the trouble."
3,Fragile Which I knew :(,"The bird was a gift for my husband and we had it on the mantle over the fire place. We were enjoying watching the bird drink non-stop. Unfortunately, my 9 year old wanted a closer look and dropped it on the fireplace and decapitated the bird. I am not sure I would purchase it again at the price I paid, but if I notice a price drop I will probably purchase it again."
4,Brings back memories,I got this as a gift for my father in law. He likes this kind of thing and had one a long time ago. This took a little tweaking to get it to work. It would be so much better if it came with a glass at the ideal height. I had to search around to find the best water glass. But it is fun and it works .... all.... day.... long.
1,Why bother?,"I got this because of Amazon's cheap price. IMHO, it's not worth it! The sculpt is substandard. I've seen pics of the prototype and now seeing it in front of my, it's STILL bad!. The right arm is STILL too short. I thought by now they would improve the flaws but apparently, they didn't! Very disappointed!"
3,Disappointing Content,"Concept is great for a Thomas fan, but many of the objects are generic and not related to Thomas when there are easily available Thomas options. ""V"" is for Viaduct (!!!???) when it could easily have been for ""Victor."" ""F"" is for flowers vs. Ferdinand. The letters associated with Thomas characters are perfect but only represent about half of the items. ""X"" is for box is just wrong. Pieces are well-constructed and durable and fit together very well."
4,perfect if you're visiting for a weekend or a year,"I bought this book while I was living in Rome, and in my six months there saw nearly all the sights listed and more. I especially loved the book's size--I could hide it in my pocket and not look so much like a tourist, and I didn't have to walk around with a big huge map unfolded in front of me. If only the maps in the book could be a little more detailed (like, including the names of the piazzas and churches mentioned in the text!). The bars and restaurants recommended are places I actually went and would recommend to other travelers.I did find some errors in the text, but unless you're searching for specific works of art, etc. like I do, this shouldn't be a problem. Definitely my favorite of my 5+ Rome travel guides.. I like it even more than the one in Italian!"
4,opinion,I really don't care for Lonely Planet's Italy guide so I bought this one. Many of the descriptions are brief.
2,"A terrible book, strangely unhelpful and oddly organized.","As long time computer user with extensive experience with dBase, I was chagrined and frustrated with my attempts to learn Act!4 quickly with the help of this book. The author seemed to persistently overstate and elaborate on the obvious, while offering minimum assistance in the more opaque areas. Invariably, what I most wanted to know as a new user was either unavailble or relegated to a chapter nearer the book's index than its beginning. The author, annoyingly, saw fit to repeatedly suggest securing professional help in various areas...and even (and I suspect, self-servingly) cited names of pros who the reader could hire. As a teaching tool, this book is a total bust..unless I'm just not enough of a ""dummy"" to appreciate it. It's my first and certainly last book of the Dummy series."
3,"Mostly helpful, often repetitve, sometimes vague","While the book is definitely helpful in learning ACT, it sometimes vaguely introduces topics and fails to adequately explain them. It also often discusses the same topic in 3 or 4 different chapters."
2,Really?,"""and then when your stomachs are grumbly, love is unwrapping your treats. And love is stuffing them all in at once, leaving masses of mess on your cheeks.""I purchased this book because I loved the bright watercolor illustrations (Vanessa Cabban does amazing work) and read it several times with great enthusiasm. Then I realized what I was reading. The beginning and ending both offer strong reminders of what love should be for a child, but the whole middle is filler and trash. Love doesn't have anything to do with stuffing masses of mess into your face or butterflies tapping on your toes. The book trivializes the concept of love for young readers. I made several alterations in my copy and have since then been able to enjoy the book with my son (he loves the illustrations, especially the last two) but I would never purchase another book by this author."
5,Fabulous book! Great story!,"Shirley Hughes's books are incredible, and this one is our favorite. I have read this book to all 3 of my daughters and they all love it. They are now 19, 15, and 4. I grew up in England and have lived in the US for the last 35 years and Shirley Hughes's books bring back the feeling of being in England so well. Little ones can listen for hours to her stories!"
5,Alfie Gets in Frist Book Review,"Alfie Gets in Frist is about a boy who gets in first. He gets lonely and starts to cry. His sister was hungry and thirsty so she was crying to. I think it's funny, but it's not supposed to be. Here's why I think it's funny: it has this page and it's a funny page. It shows him cyring up a storm. I think it's funny because he has more tears than a regular cry.I think people who like sort of funny books should read this. Also, people who like short books with some challenging words should read it."
5,Stellar performance!,"I agree wholeheartedly with Johji Josquin, who points out the key elements to this splendid performance--it is sung ""one to a part"" and closely miked--which combine to help to make the music so immediate and alive, my head spun around from my desk at the first sung notes and I caught myself staring at the speaker. I have four other versions of these Vespers--Suzuki's on BIS, Gardiner's on London, Harnoncourt's, and Garrido's on K167/Harmonia Mundi--and, though Suzuki's is superb and finely done, this Alessandrini version is the one that brings the music to intimate life.I don't write amazon reviews, but I must urge any love of Monteverdi a/o baroque choral music to take this performance completely seriously. It is so lovely, achingly so, it reminds me of how I felt the first time I heard any great piece of music.Fabulously moving, beautiful, and both tenderly and fulsomely performed. Bravo! Really."
5,Beautiful beautiful,Read the other reviews for the technical details. All I can say this one rocked my world!!!
1,Misguided & Offensive,"This book is so misguided and offensive, that it is dangerous. Seavoy blames world hunger on the ""indolence"" of peasants (1), and calls for government military action to ""induce or coerce"" (39) semi-subsistence farmers into commercialized export production. The book is filled with such baffling--and completely unsupported--assertions as: ""Children are sources of labor that allow [peasant] parents to enjoy indolence"" (9). Amidst such sweeping and problematic generalizations, there is an alarming throughline of sheer, violent animosity toward semi-subsistent growers, culminating in his call to governments to use military force against those engaged in self-provisioning agriculture (112). Beware."
3,Product not needed but kudos to Amazon.com,"I made a mistake in ordering this product - I need something for hardwood floors, and these are for carpet. I accept 80% of the fault for making this mistake, however, in going back and trying to find ones for hardwood floors, I couldn't. So I was looking for what wasn't there.However, a kudos shout out to Amazon: when I submitted the request to return it, they essentially said they'd credit the money back to me and I could just keep the product. I'm sure it costs more money for them to restock, etc, than the $5 they'd make selling this again but it was very nice on my end to not have to fuss with shipping it back and yet still get my money back. Thanks!"
4,GOOD PRODUCT,These were easy to install on my dining room chairs and work great on my tile floor...assume they would work well on carpet.
3,"Good but, 2","Ordered these because we have a eight sided, solid cherry, drum table in our office that is heavy and difficult to move. We originally had rectangular, non-stick sliders underneath the table and we were able to move it but they were too wide and occasionally didn't move when the table did.These sliders were difficult to insert into our table. It took some good wacks to get them to stay. Our high hopes were gone as soon as we flipped the table and found out they do not work if you have two layers such as carpeting with a thick pad or carpeting with an oriental rug on top as we do. They just do not have enough depth"
4,RGBs head to the GB,"The Ghostbusters First GameBoy outing is slightly short of spectacular. Obviously borrowing heavily from the Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle games, The Real Ghostbusters improves on the formula, but only slightly with two adjustments. Peter Venkman (The only playable character) can crawl and fire his proton pack to break blocks. The Ghostbusters theme sounds decent as does the rest of the music, but still has that tinny GameBoy sound to it. Oh well. And the game is black & white too. But it accepts decent colors on the newer GameBoy Color and GameBoy Advance"
3,Not sure about this book,"I read this book with an interest in the training and background of the Army Special Forces. In this book an Aikido instructor which is a soft-style type of martial art in the San Francisco Bay Area in the ""hippie"" town of Mill Valley is assigned to train some Green Berets to get in touch with their sensitive side as an Army experiment to make them more effective in their jobs. Two other associates are hired by the author to help change the SF thinking and mindset. And although I found the background of these men to be interesting I failed to see what was accomplished by this mission. Were these SF guys suppose to become more introspective as they are killing the enemy? If anyone figures it out let me know. For the confusion I give it three stars."
3,Amnesia,"The author claims he was a Marine, yet seems dumbfounded by the attitude of his soldier-students. I'm not sure what to make of this."
1,A weak story of a wasteful government project,This is a lame book by a New Age nobody who wasted his time with a bunch of Green Berets (a group of guys who think they alone possess initiative and free-thinking skills).
3,Nice Colors,"Length:: 0:15 MinsNice variety of colors.What I find fault with is that they aren't very blendable.They can scratch the paper as they are very hard.Other than that , the colors are nice and I would recommend them especially for children."
2,"Cheap Price, Cheap Performance - You get what you pay for","I picked the Crayolas over the Berol Prismacolor (to save some money) to color an Anatomy coloring book for school. Big mistake. The Crayolas are made of a harder substance and thus the colors do not easily glide onto the paper as is the case with Berols. This is important when you need to be precise in coloring small detail. Thus it took a lot longer to color a page, not mention the higher difficulty level and frustrations that accompany the coloring experience.Now if the coloring objective is for small children's coloring books, then these Crayolas are fine for these needs. But if you're an adult or need to color something more sophisticated, go with the Berols!"
5,very good:),You can't expect more for this money - very good:)Many colours and u can paint very well with them:)
5,You get what you get,These are exactly what you'd expect at a good price. If you need colored pencils- buy them because they were a much better deal than what local stores were offering.
4,Durable and Cheap Colored Pencils,"The Crayola 24 pack colored pencils come in a variety of colors enough for your everyday needs. It is sharpened, so you don't need to worry about that until later, also, Crayola is a pretty nice brand, and the price is very nice."
5,Great,These colored pencils are the best. They last a long time and rarely break. they are perfect for kids coloring books and drawing.
3,Not Rider Back,"They say the deck is rider back, but it is actually the newer standard version that is lower quality. The only reason I bought this is to get a rider back deck to match my gaff deck. I also heard bicycle is returning to the old cards so I'm hoping that later you will sell rider backs."
1,Not Rider Backs,even though i read other reviews stating the cards were not the ones shown. i took a chance cause i really wanted the dice plus the cards to. the cards are bicycle but they are the cheapest ones they make. all five of the dice have the bicycle logo on them.
2,playing cards,These cards were felt flimsy and after a few times some stated to bend. I would not buy these cards again.
2,neither best or essential,"from the late 60's after Fahey left his own Takoma label and signed with the ""big"" Vanguard lable.Occationally interesting Fahey ""symphonies"" for solo guitar, but not as clever or thought provoking as his Takoma recordings, half of which remain unreleased on CD as of today.Best cuts are ""Yellow Princess"" ""Requiem for Mississippi John Hurt"" and ""When the Catfish is in Bloom"". Contains a lot of filler."
4,Another R & B and R & R gem,"This was the Rolling Stones post 'Satisfaction' disc, so, this was a tough work to follow. Somehow the Stones managed to pull it off by getting another #1 on the charts with' ""Get Off My Cloud"". No one was quite sure what the point of this song was, but the 3 chord wonder was catchy. The flip side was,""I'm Free"".All these cuts were 2 minute eggs except for ""She Said Yeah""which was a minute and a half. Mostly great Rock and R&B; which is what made Jagger and Richards their mark in music history.The album moves right along and is appreciate by R&B; folk and the over 45 crowd or a TRUE Brian era fan. Buy it."
5,At Their Best,"This was my favorite Stone's Album when it came out in the 60's in the 33 and a third vinyl record format. I was a teen and a Stones fanatic. This was when Brian Jones was still alive. In my humble opinion, the best Stones material was created when Brian was still alive. I don't much care for the stuff that came after. I still listen to the remastered CD and get a very pleasant nostalgia rush when I listen:):)"
3,"Not the Best, but pretty important","December's Children comes off as a rather uneven document of the Stones' song-writing prowess and a scattershotrock record in its own right. Nonetheless, their identity as a band distinct from the British invasion clones really emerges on these tracks."
4,The Stones fifth album.,"The Stones were still redoing American blues standards on this album. Although two of the songs ""Get Off My Cloud"" and ""AS Tears Go By"" were their own and turned out to be big singles. Their next album (Aftermath U.S. 1966) were all original Richards/Jagger songs."
4,nostalgic,"The album 'December's Children' by the legendary group Rolling Stones is fantastic, like almost all the albums of the Stones. But this one particularly is also nostalgic, especiallly the masterpieces 'You Better Move On' and 'As Tears Go By'. Songs that you want to hear them very often with that fantastic music composed by Keith Richards mixed with the vocals of Mick Jagger. I liked it very much and I'm proud that it now makes part of my musical library!!"
4,Patchy,"Certainly a mish mash, cobbled together without much care by London records.A collection of new tracks, (for the time), older tracks, live tracks, studio tracks, major releases and 'rejects', some of which didn't get a UK release at the time.Yet it still works, it's great to listen to and a very enjoyable album."
3,Order as Super Audio CD and got the normal remastered CD,"Placed the order as a gift for a good friend who asked for the Super Audio Remastered 2002 edition, on the site was standing that it is a Super Audio CD, three weeks later the order was in my postbox and when i opened the good packed envelop i saw it was the normal DSD Remastered 2002 edition and not the Super Audio which i asked for.I looked on the internet and saw that the information was changed from Super Audio into normal CD.Hope that next time the info is right and keeps that way, because this is a big shame.But the present was ok for my friend, and i heard that the album sounds good, but he rather had the Super Audio CD.Ben de Waal (Holland)"
2,December's Children has too much filler,"This is perhaps the weakest album in the Rolling Stones 60's catalog. But don't blame the band, this is the record companies fault. Sure there are some great tunes here like She Said Yeah, Get off of My Cloud, As Tears Go By and some decent tunes like You Better Move On and I'm Free. But there's just too much weak material, songs like Talking About You, Look What You've Done, The Singer Not the Song, Gotta Get Away and Blue Turns to Grey feel flat. Then the live renditions of Route 66 and I'm Movin' On are alright, but feel like fun filler.December's Children (And Everybody's) ~ The Rolling Stones: 2 1/2 stars"
3,Not Too Special,"Somehow December's Children falls short of other Rolling Stones recordings during the Brian Jones era. Whereas recordings like Aftermath, Between The Buttons, and 12 X 5 feature catchy hooks and creative arrangements, December's Children seems to feature the Stones going through the motions with a few noteworthy moments.Get Off My Cloud is clearly the best song in this lot with ringing guitars and super drumming. As Tears Go By is a touching ballad and I'm Free has a fairly catchy tone. The live tracks, I'm Moving On and Route 66 have some good energy but do not vary much from prior fast rockers that the Stones recorded at that time. When Blue Turns To Grey and The Singer Not The Song have nice poppy tones but seem kind of ordinary with recordings as Out Of Time and Lady Jane.If you feel the Rolling Stones can do no wrong, pick this one up. However, it surely does not rank as a premiere recording."
2,Not an SACD,"I bought this because it is listed as an SACD.What I was sent is a DSD disc. It does not register as an SACD on my player. It sounds miserable.What gives, has the SACD been replaced by this other format?It's one of my favorite Stones albums. I am not pleased."
5,Uplifting and Inspirational,"This is one of the best gospel recordings I have come acrosss. I constantly hear of works and other publication from Walter Scrutchings. I feel that this recording will really inspire and uplift the down hearted. I have been inspired by this recording artist and I hope to hear more good music from Mr. Scrutchings.God Bless You, Music Lover U.S.A."
5,Very Good Board,Been running this motherboard for 2 years. Its flawless and fast. Great deal for the money.
5,great deal great shirt,got it for a birthday gift to a friend .. he loved itthanks so much for the service and the quality of the productJim
4,Great Game!,"Really fun game, but a little tricky. I don't think it's good for kids 7 and under. Jewel thief was the best. I would definately recommend this game."
5,all american rejects tee shirt,"the shirt arrived in good time. the only complaint i have is really my fault. i should have ordered an adult small instead of the youth large, but the tee shirt itself is great. thanks"
2,Tragically bad--spoilers ahead,"This is a movie about how when you try to seduce your mom's sleazy boyfriend, sometimes your mom will catch you and throw you out, and you will buy a bus ticket to a resort town during offseason and hook up with a simpering, bi-curious ranch-hand. Then the lady who owns the motel will lament about her imprisoned son and tell you your mom still loves you.Whatever. The plot was thin, the acting overdone, the dialog unbelievable."
4,Head over Heels with Heidi,"Very tough little film and a totally believable performance by Cornish as Heidi and the male lead who convey the confusion of sex with love, a damaging and prevalent feature of contemporary life. The male is equally confused about his sexuality, aware that Heidi harbours even greater neediness than himself, albeit with less potentially damaging outcomes. The interpay with the child who has Aspergers syndrome echoes much of Heidi's behaviour. Her resort to what appears a very adolescent diary and her enacment in front of the mirror will disturb as it elucidates. Her curiosity about the lad, and a flash of her observing him on a trampoline suggest her realization of this.Congratulations to the team that accomplished this masterful and moving story.I reckon it's tackled an extremley urgent issue with sensitive aplomb."
2,White Trash Down Under,"Park City or Jackson Hole translated to Australia? Just what I don't need! Before ""Somersault"", I don't think I'd ever seen an Australian movie that didn't show me something fresh, some emotional or psychological originality. ""Somersault"" is well filmed, I suppose, and the scenery is rich, but that's all. It's as trite and predictable as any B-rate melodrama about a teenage runaway from a trailer court in Oklahoma. The acting by the male characters is TV level at best. The script is awful. I couldn't sit it out. I'd rather watch wombats cavorting on the Nature Channel."
3,A teenage girl goes astray,"A teenage girl is caught by her mother in heavy petting with the mother's live in boy friend. Still much a child the young girlhas the body of a young goddess, and she runs away from homeand uses it on some poor souls that meet her.So much confusion in a young soul can lead to real troubleif other her age were to follow her example?A culture should encourage young girls to virtue aswhen they act like sluts, they endanger othersas is the case when her nearly steady boy finds her with a causal pick up.If this were my daughter, I would have really been hurting half way through the film! So I guess thatthe acting is pretty good as it got to me.I just didn't like the subject all that well."
1,Can I give zero stars?,What kind of sick puppies are rating this 5 stars? Nas-T. I'm not going to elaborate. I've wasted enough time on this movie.
5,Somersault,"Abbie Cornish delivers an Academy Award worthy performance in this under-appreciated film. I had never heard of her before and was blown away by the depth of this young girls ability. I can't say the film has a happy ending, but it does have a hopeful ending. It is painful to watch sometimes as Heidi (Abbie Cornish) makes terrible adolescent mistakes. She is such a likable character that I found myself cringing as she did things that would scar her forever. Nonetheless, she survives and gains a little wisdom along the way. Sam Worthington also delivers a strong supporting performance. As far as I am concerned this is a must see. I might add that viewers should follow their viewing of Somersault with a look at Candy. In Candy, Abbie Cornish stars with the late Heath Ledger and once again delivers an amazing performance (as does Heath Ledger)."
5,Good looking and funny,"I got it for my husband (205 and 6'10). true to size. looking good, easy to put on.very good purchase"
4,Flash Gordon costume rocks!,"We purchased this item for a friend to wear at our local Relay For Life. Our theme this year is ""I Relay for my hero"" and we are the lightening bolts, striking out cancer. The costume is great!It looks just like the ones in the party stores and I would expect to pay $50 or more for it. I would buy from this seller again."
3,It looks great But it's incomplete.,It looks great but they forgot that the Flash's costume includes gloves and a RING! His costume springs from a ring.
4,A very thorough analysis with statistics.,The analysis that Dr. Arnold did along with Terry Denny over the 14 years of this study are vital and informative. Academic resources and the ability of some students to have access to information can play such an important role in the formation of high school student to successful adult citizen.
1,Has anybody ever heard of Jwin?,"This DVD player rates pretty high as probably the worst piece if electronic equipment I've ever owned. I bought 3 of them ($40 each). All 3 were defective. In my opinion they are built to break. It feels cheap, it looks cheap. Save your money."
4,Nice and Compact,"Got the black fridge for my office and love it! I guess my complaints would be that at times it can be a tad loud and since I do not drink soda, the soda slot is lost real estate (the bars are not removable). Overall I like it a lot and am happy with the purchase."
5,Pentex Camera is the best,this is my second Pentex. This particular camera is a little more advanced than my first but incredibly easy to operate and load. The photographs are bright and crisp and always clear.As you can tell this is my favorite!
5,greatest movie ever,Love this movie this is my favorite gerard bulter ever. Great plot great scence where Gerry bulter is nude lol. Great surprise ending
3,Intense,"While I have enjoyed Gerard Butler's earlier works, I cannot in all fairness say I liked this outing at all. While the acting was credible, the subject matter left a good deal to be desired. I prefer to see him in things like ""The 300"", ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""Timeline"". But that's just my opinion, others may see it differently."
5,not for the squemish,Except fo r some of the violence it was really exciting and different. I don't care for gross torture stuff.
4,Makes you want to root for the bad guy.,"I had pretty low expectations for this movie after seeing it was written by Kurt Wimmer of Ultraviolet fame. I enjoyed his first movie - Equilibrium a lot, but I thought that his efforts had gone downhill since there. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's one of those movies where you want the bad guy to win.As far as the quality of the blu-ray disc, I'd have to say that this is excellent. The audio on it was amazing - blasting sound out of my rear speakers that I was not expecting quite frequently. The picture quality was also top notch.Definitely glad I purchased it."
4,Machiavelli on Trial,"If you played by the established rules in society and at every turn you gave, but received very little in return, what would you do? ""Law Abiding Citizen"" answers the question. Part of the equation call for skills in military science, master engineering with a twinge of diabolicalness and nothing to lose. Now, we have a movie! But, in addition, we have society's worst enemy.""Law Abiding Citizen"" while being more in the Action/Adventure genre', could stretch the conventionalism of traditional Science Fiction with a view of the future. Think Bill Gates being totally disenchanted with society and turning all his forces of technology against us. Farfetched? Maybe, but ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is the future of criminality; highly sensitive, intellectual, calculating and ambitious individuals training their sights upon dismantling society as we know it.Watch ""Law Abiding Citizen"" and judge for yourself. Only the screen writer saved us.Edward BrownCore Edge Image & Charisma Institute"
3,Are you serious???,"It was a great movie. Gerard Butler played Clyde Shelton with a passion that makes you believe in him and actually understand where he is coming from. People grieve in different ways and his way was to kill everybody that did not do ""justice"" to his wife and childs case. Shelton was a wonderfully planned out character and so were the others. The movie was an edge-of-the-seat thriller until the ending. He used methodical process throughout the whole movie and then all of a sudden he does not see this coming? Are you serious? This man thought out a damn-near perfect plan and then all of a sudden he just does not see them going to this place and finding him? The ending was very dissapointing almost to the fact that it brought down the whole movie. He could have been entered in with the likes of Saw and Hannibal Lecter. But the ending sucked. Badly done. Try that one again."
2,Disappointing...,The first half of the movie was pretty good and had an interesting premise. However it got very unrealistic towards the end...
2,For Future Viewers...,"The beginning and middle of the movie was great but then, like most movies that are action packed, it becomes ""Stupid"". It makes you feel like there was a rush to finish the movie because the ending sucked. At this time, it takes a lot for me to pay any money for a movie to keep and own anymore. With this one, I am stuck with it and will probably never watch it again."
2,A contrived and unfun revenge flick.,"Law Abiding Citizen would have made a real good revenge flick but that plot is just window dressing for some contrived tale about justice and technicalities. The movie is well made and glossy production. The direction is good and so is the acting from the two leads. I just didn't care for how contrived the plot was. There's a few scenes of very bloody bloodletting (it looks as if it was heavily edited) and graphic violence. Unfortunately, these scenes are thinly spreaded out in the 100 plus minute film. The trailer has a lot of spoilers and manages to show the entire movie (albeit in a very brief snippets). I would have loved to have seen this film as a hardcore revenge/action film instead of this mediocre film that was produced instead."
4,Definate Bloody Boy Movie,"Cat and Mouse clever plot. Very bloody. I love the warped message to ""the legal system"". Victum turns meglamaniac. Kevin Bacon is a stock broker turned vigilatee just like this movie. Great Movie unless you are a chickflick lover"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I kept seeing this movie at Blockbuster, but never found myself interested. Finally rented it one day after I had seen all the new movies out, so glad I did. After watching it I immediately got on amazon and ordered it. This movie will have you saying ""That was crazy awesome""."
2,"the middle was good, then it went bland again.","the beginning was, well, gross.the middle kept me guessing, which I actually enjoyed.the end, well, just got goofy."
3,Revenge is Not So Sweet,"This is a new take on an old story - an honest man is cheated by the legal system and decides to take matters into his own hands. The difference is that this time the citizen is taking on not only the bad guys but the lawyers and judges as well and it's all being done while he's sitting in prison. Turns out the law abiding citizen is a CIA trained ""brain"" whose job in the past has been to figure out new ways to kill people. Now he's using those skills to make the justice system do his bidding.The idea is good but the execution is sloppy. There's no depth to the characters. You only get the most basic of looks into what makes them tick. A great deal more time is spent on big explosions and other messy ways to kill people.I think this is definitely more of a guy's movie although Jamie Fox and Gerard Butler do provide some nice eye candy for the ladies. If you're into movies like Die Hard, this one is for you."
3,Really good movie,"this is a really good movie! I have seen it several times, and it still entertains me.My order was shipped to me on time, as expected. The dvd was a little scratched, and it skipped in 1 or 2 places, but that's what you get when you buy a used dvd for $3."
3,Yet another revenge flick,"It's got a few twists and some stomach-turning violence and it's just another revenge flick in the end. And the end is so boring to boot. When a movie starts off with the killing and rape of the hero's loved ones, it really doesn't matter much what's next: the writer has already signified that he's lazy.Add some good actors (Meaney, Butler) and a fair actor trying way too hard (Foxx), saddle them with some insipid dialogue, kill a bunch of people, add a dash of torture porn, throw in some half-baked cries for justice, and bake at 350 for 108 minutes.Remove and let sit and realize you're looking at something that really ain't very tasty."
3,Taking Revenge to a New Level,"Talk about taking revenge of the criminal justice system to a new level, that is basically what this movie is about. But instead of it being a past defendant who gets out of prison, it is just the opposite, a victim who is upset with the way the system treated his attackers. Overall the movie was ok in my opinion, got a little bored in the middle of it, yet the beginning and end were quite interesting. Some graphic bloody scenes which I thought were a little too much and could have done without them. It's a different type of criminal law movie and I would not compare it to say, A Few Goood Men or The Lincoln Lawyer, but if you like movies about courts and the judicial system, then would think you could enjoy it.Peter J. Miller"
3,just okay,"The movie was pretty good, but a little predictable. I had a hard time believing the character played by Gerard Butler, he seemed too over the top and as if he was trying so hard to be deep. It's a good Saturday afternoon movie to watch."
1,Worst Written Thriller of All Time,The only thing worse than the writing in this gory vigilante thriller were the gigantic holes in the plot. The main character (played by Gerard Butler) was completely inconsistent and Jamie Fox's character was flimsy and unlikable. The movie began and ended in the first fifteen minutes and the remaining hour was painfully difficult to sit through. If you like an intellectual thriller this is NOT it.
1,A total immoral film.,"This is undoubtly the worst immoral film on the circuit today. The HERO sees is wife and child brutaly murdered. The attorney does a deal whats new???, so the murderer gets 10 years. We now have to believe that the attorney is now the hero No NO NO. The attorney never gets the point that justice is never true justice just what we can get from it if we are fortnate be in the system. If we are not part of the justice system then we are f*****. This film should be banned from ever being broadcast or put out in the public view."
1,Good movie but terrible ending made it worthless,Talk about a terrible ending I usually dont review things but this movie was so bad i had to make a review so no one else will waste their money. This movie has a great story about a father getting vengeance against the screwed up legal system and corrupt politicians but then ending is terrible. Talk about a major letdown I guess if you like a movie where evil prevails and the government wins by cutting deals and being corrupt then you would like this movie.Overall the ending of law abiding citizen the worst ending that I have ever seen even though i spent $20 for this movie im throwing it away because its not worth being in my collection.
1,Ending spoiled an otherwise good movie.,"I thought that this was a fairly good movie, but the ending sucked and ruined the whole movie for me."
1,law abiding murderer,"I did not like this, not a title I'd buy. I get wanting to reap revenge on the thugs that killed his family, but the level he took things to was way over the top and that made me not feel for the father at all and also borders on unbelievable. Killing or endangering the lives of innocents is unacceptable to me. Sure kill the two responsible for the crime b/c our legal system is too weak, but it should end there. I dont like the movie b/c it's a Richie Rich story of a brainiac father who apparently has access to military grade weaponry. Didn't like the ending either"
1,The whole thing sucks because of the ending.,"Its great... till the end. That's really all there is to it. Don't buy it. Watch it once, that's all you'll need."
1,BLU-RAY MAFIA?,"I really liked the movie and was looking forward to purchasing the Special Edition/Unrated DVD just to find out that the only unrated version is on BLU RAY!!?? Are you Kidding?!! I am a film maker and I PAY for special edition DVD's to support those involved in making the movies. If the format I use (because I am tired of being bullied into the newest technology & dvd's last until I die) is no longer selling UNRATED/SPECIAL EDITIONS, then I might as well DL them for Free or find a friend who has it and rip his! Yes, This is the ONLY negative review I have ever given and am very upset. It is the studio's loss then! If anyone finds an UNRATED/Special Edition DVD, then please let me know as I will most likely be in the market for one. I'm off to search torrents!Laters"
4,I have no desire to see the unrated cut on Blu-ray,"The theatrical cut of this film walked too fine a line between courtroom drama/action mystery and a slasher horror film. Granted, it never went quite far enough to gross me out, but, it came close enough to making me think it was going to .One scene early on almost made me stop watching .Sometimes less is more.Squeamishness aside, it's a first rate thriller.There are plenty of mysteries to unravel as the ""Law Abiding Citizen"" enacts his revenge.Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler turn in credible performances.In the hands of a lesser cast ,this script might have gone straight to video.Recommended with reservations"
3,"Movie is great, People who shipped? Not so much.","I ordered new yet I was sent used. The picture online was shown of the US version however I received the Canadian Version(Which is fine because it is in both English in French). No digital copy sleeve, no inserts, which points to it being an obviously used copy. Slow shipping, and when asked why I was sent a used copy there was never a response. Again, great item, poor vendor."
4,a sleeper,"my wife bought it and it turned out to be really good. part count of monte cristo and part se7en. a hollywood movie that ridicules the flaws of our justice system? yup, and done well."
2,"Violent thriller that pushes ""ridiculous"" to the max","After a brutal and depressing start, this violent, suspenseful revenge thriller--disguised as a subpar meditation on the morals of the legal system--became fairly engaging. Even as the plot spiraled into the realm of the ridiculous, I just held on tight, awaiting what I hoped would be a terrific and shocking finale. But this rollercoaster just sputters to a grinding halt before bursting into flames in one of the worst endings I have ever seen in this genre.The end result is a fairly decent hour-long suspense vehicle sandwiched between fifty extra minutes of nothing special--a dreary, uncomfortable start and an absurd conclusion. This is not the kind of film I would ever likely revisit, so at best I could only recommend it as a rental. And even then, it would be a lukewarm recommendation because there are many other films that deliver the same moral message in a much better, more convincing manner."
3,agree with reviewer ross--ending ruined it,"i would give this movie a four star rating but for the last ten minutes of the movie which ruined it for me. it is so sappy, so sentimental and so ridiculous, that i can only imagine some studio hack came up with it at the eleventh hour. or maybe they used a focus group. but i was having a good time up until then when a father takes revenge against those in the legal system who let a killer walk free. all the people he gets rid of were well worth it and i enjoyed that portion hugely, which fortunately is the bulk of the movie."
5,Excellent movie,Law abiding citizens is a movie you'll enjoy from start to finish. Great action and suspense and great acting. Though you probably won't watch it a 2nd time for this type of movies.
4,Action Movie,"I bought this movie after having watch it on the big screen and knew i had to have this as a collectors item, it has a lot of action and suspense and it really had me wondering through the entire show and the ending was unexpected... really great movie action from start to finish,...its a five star in my books"
2,Two hours of my life I'll never get back,"Law Abiding Citizen is a movie that has an interesting premise, but it's execution (pun intended) is ultimately unsatisfying.Ambition-driven D.A. vs. Revenge-driven grieving widower/father- neither character is portrayed with enough sympathetic characteristics to make the viewer care about what happens to them. The movie quickly devolves into a waiting game for the next high tech killing to occur.Jamie Fox's talent is wasted here, and Gerard Butler is just simply a waste- he has one expression/emotion throughout the whole movie.Don't waste your time or money."
3,Okay for a Sunday afternoon,"My review is from the perspective of a single girl, grad student. I watched this on a Sunday afternoon and I thought it was just 'okay'. It's nothing I would invite friends over to see. I could appreciate the story line about a highly skilled guy trying to outsmart the authorities but more than anything I was a tad disappointed to see Jamie Foxx in this; it just seems like he should be in better roles. This is good for a relaxing day because it's the type of movie where you don't have to think much and you can get up and get refreshments and go to the bathroom and not miss the story line."
2,Good Idea marred by poor acting and lousy ending.,"I was looking forward to this movie, the trailers made it look very good. But Gerard Butler's acting was below par, Jamie Foxx's acting was pitiful. If it wasn't for the lousy acting, ludicrous assumption that results in finding out how he is doing it and the atrocious ending, this might have been a good movie.The main plot is that Clyde Shelton (Butler) is going to teach the DA Nick Rice (Foxx) a lesson because Rice took the easy way out on the murder trial of Shelton's family. In the end, Rice learns nothing. If the movie is meant to show how poor our justice system is, it does succeed somewhat on that.If you are expecting a Justice/Vengeance movie, it will be disappointing. Law Abiding Citizen tried to be a modern day Death Wish but fails on the acting and ending."
5,Excellent Movie,I loved this movie. I dont know what extra to write except the whole family loved the movie.
3,When grief takes over and justice is relative,"It is a film that starts with home invasion gone bad - really, really bad. Husband is stabbed to death (but survives - Gerard Butler), wife is raped and killed and so is their little daughter. One wonders what good can come out of such gruesome violence and how anyone surviving such event can ever regain their humanity again. What is left to hope for, live for and plan for?However, when a victim of such crime is a former special forces agent trained to make tactical plans and kill wothout thinking twice, it seems that all is fair game. With nothing left to live for, plenty of money and time to plan revenge on people who took away what he loved most ofr did nto careenough to fight for justice, all participants in this story are fair game for serial killer who has lost the last connection of his humanity.Not a very believable scenario, but film is a thriller nevertheless. If taken likely, it is bearable."
3,Disturbing scenes,"Knowing that there would be some graphic scenes I decided to watch this movie anyway. I found the movie interesting, but the scenes of torture and mutilation was a bit much for my sensibilities. Definitly not for kids under 17 IMO. But I felt like a deer in the headlights, not really wanting to see such things but not being able to move my eyes from it. That said, I had difficulty getting the graphic scenes out of my mind at bed time so I tried to compensate by watching a lighter movie afterward.I do agree with the viewers who felt it should have had a different ending. I think it would have been a better ending had he gotten away sort of like Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs"". THAT would have left me with an OMG feeling."
3,Not for the week stomach...,"First of all, I had never heard of this movie until my fiance put it into the dvd player. It is surprisingly not bad. However, it is graphic and bloody. That being said it was entertaining and well thought out. Butler played his ""crazy/vengeful teacher"" part well. Briefly, it is about a man who watches his wife and daughter get killed. When the DA doesn't handle the case the way Shelton wants, he waits ten years and plots mass distruction of the criminal system. It bears saying a second time: BLOODY!!!!"
3,Ain't no heroes here,"Every one is tainted, except the kids. A give no quarter attitude is the ideal. No gray allowed. Enjoyable, but a comic book feel to complicated issues."
3,Some good some bad,"For the most part I was entertained by the film which is a combination thriller/action/horror film. A man's wife and child are killed during a home invasion. Instead of justice, the prosecutor(Jamie Foxx) plea bargains the case because he is not 100% sure he can win and in his quest to raise his stature in his firm he wants to keep a high percentage of wins no matter what. Gerard is not happy with this and is much more than he seems. Years later he starts to take his revenge on the system and people he thinks betrayed him. God concept and story holds up fairly well until the totally outlandish ending. Gerard Butler is terrific both sympathetic and menacing. Foxx however was so unlikeable in the role I found myself routing for the bad guy the entire movie. I don't know if it was the script or Foxx himself who brought nothing to his role. Some pretty gruesome scenes for those who are faint of heart. This is a good rental."
3,good but not great,"It was good in the sense that it was thrilling and kept the audience guessing but it would have been great had the ending been tweaked a little. I felt that it fell short with what Foxx's character came to realize. Yes not to make deals with murderers but to recognize that the whole system was flawed. Had the ending left off with Foxx being in a seat of power and having to choose between what the current system is and changing it for the better, that would have been a step in the right direction. Still a good movie and one that can provoke deeper conversations among the audience."
5,SPELL BINDING,This movie held me at the TV through out the entire movie...Would and have told everyone I see that they have to watch this movie.....
3,Ending RUINED it for me.,"I really was enjoying this film in the beginning. It was dark, and went places few films have. the acting wasn't stellar but the story was entertaining and it had the potential to be very much like the movie SE7EN. Unfortunately, it felt like the writer or writers needs to finish the film in a hurry and the ending became too cookie cutter and quiet frankly was just BS. It was as if someone wrote the first half of the movie, and then they couldn't retain the writer so they got a student to finish it off. It is a true pity because I really did like this movie from the beginning up to 3/4 of the way."
3,Mixed bag,"This was a SPECTACULAR movie, right up until the end that is.Why Hollyweird has to ruin really good movies with the sappy, predictable, ""good triumphs over evil"" ending I'll never understand.What a shame."
4,Ending should be better,"The show's great but in all honesty, I've seen better endings.At the end, it seemed that Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) still could not fathom the bitter anger that Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) has felt. Neither did he appreciate the leniency that Clyde has given (by not killing him or his family).My heart sank for Clyde."
4,good,Super good movie. Both Jamie Fox and Gerard Butler are solid actors and do a good job in this movie.
2,like,"The movie was so intense,well played Gerard was great ,but i wished it had ended differently,i am buying it soon.I give it a rating 3.5,well done."
3,Not Bad,"It's a decent distraction, nice to see Jamie Fox in something decent outside of Ray...The acting is pretty good, but the story has way too many plot holes."
3,Picnic Table Time Machine In a New Castle Garage,"... Most of us, having reached seventy plus find it easy to remember details half a century earlier even when we can't remember where we put our glasses five minutes ago... so it was with Joseph DeVivo when he sat down at a picnic table in the garage of his New Castle, Pennsylvania home to remember his youth for grandson Curt Meine,, In great and vivid detail he described his life as a little Italian mountain boy, up to and including the touching farewell to his village as he headed for Naples and a ship to America...this narrative is simple and straightforward and the reader gets a feel for what life was like for this little boy so very long ago.. De Vivo died in 1993 at the age of 90.. You sense the joy of the interviewer for taking the time to sit and listen and record the memories of his grandfather..after finishing this very small book, the reader wishes, too, he had taken the time to listen and record memories of his elders."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! IT'S COOL HOW THEY PUT THE SCRIPT IN THE BOOK.I've seen the movie 5 times, and I can't wait until August 19th when it comes out! I'll be sure to be it.It took 10 days for it to arrive, but it was worth the wait! I ordered used. But it was in perfect condition."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I've seen this movie 8 times, so it's just natural that I bought this book. The book cover was damaged, so I told amazon, and they sent me a new one, free of charge, within days! I love the pictures, they are amazing, and I love how the lyrics and script is included. This book tells the story of the movie with pictures. I also loved the behind the scenes information they had. This is a must-have for any die-hard Chicago fan."
5,One of the best renditions about Palestine ever written,"This is a captivating book about Palestine with immense detail. Written with superb academic prowess by Tom Segev, we get a detailed look at the history of the country/region known in modern times as Palestine. Highly recommended for those looking for an objective look at the area."
5,Very good product.,"This is very easy to put together, very compact and very quiet. You will feel a surprising amount of burn in your thighs and rear. If you're already in fantastic shape, you probably won't be thrilled with it, but if you're a little out of shape or just beginning an exercise program then you'll really like this. It's very easy to use while watching TV also."
1,unreliable vendor,I paid for this product on January 10th and it is March the 7th and I have yet to recieve the item regardless the amount of communication sent to the vendor. Amazon is in the process of a refund. What good is an item to you if you pay and do not receive it. Do not purchase this item.
2,A Piece of Junk,"After I used it for about one month, the equipment became very noisy. I do not know where coming from. I used it for about three months, it broke and bacame irreparable. It build with cheap material."
2,Consumer Evaluation,"This WAS intended as a gift. Product picture (instruction manual) DIFFERENT than actual product. THERE ARE NO HOLES AT BASE TO ATTACH STAND THOUGH THERE ARE BOLTS FOR SUCH. SEEMS UNSTABLE; SANS THE HOLES FOR BOLTS, UNIT NEEDS SOLDERING. Will return for refund. Due to lack of secured attachment between base and stand, can NOT confidentially recommend. Missing holes SEVERE error by manufacturer (Wagan). Safety first! (:>)Wagan EL2273 Mini Stepper Master"
2,Outdated,"This work has been made obselete by the same author's 'The Great Warbow'. While these two books are presented as complements rather than substitutes, the majority of the content is shared. And on important issues - the course of major battles and the effectiveness of the longbow against armor - the later work completely contradicts the earlier. 'Longbow' does have some interesting chapters on non-European bows and the history of sporting archery, but these are hardly enough to justify it as a whole."
5,excellent reading,"I was excited to get this book as I have been wanting it for some time. The book is everything and more than I was expecting. If your interested in the history of the longbow, this one is for you."
2,not what I thought,"This shoe was very narrow. It's best to go up at least two sizes. I was really disappointed because they are so cute and exactly what I was looking for, but they are so uncomfortable that I can barely walk after wearing them."
1,Cheap Product,"Cheap Product, case broke while taking it out of the package. tools were also cheap, definately returning it to amazon."
1,Terrible Service,I bought this for a Christmas present and it came damaged so we returned it. I called and tried to explain that I didn't just want to return it I wanted to exchange it for the same product. They didn't get it. They gave me my money back but I didn't want that I wanted the product!!!! The service was awful and I would tell anyone to not buy products from this company.
3,The Real Story On This One,"This album was released only in the U.S. on December 9, 1966. Contrary to linear notes over the years, the tracks were NOT recorded at Albert Hall. The tracks are from 2 shows Oct 1, 1966 at City Hall in Newcastle and 2 more shows on Oct 7 at Colston Hall in Bristol. I've Been Loving You Too Long and Fortune Teller were studio tracks that had live screaming overlaid (very badly) for the album release. Overall, this one doesn't come anywhere near the excitement and sound quality of Ya Ya's, but it is their first live effort.This information comes from ""It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones"" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection."
3,Stones' First (Of Many) Live Albums,"The Rolling Stones have probably released more live albums than any other rock band in history. got Live if you want it was their first and probably the worst. The selection of songs culls their early classics, but the fact that a couple of the songs were actually recorded in the studio with crowd noise added, you feel like you kind of get cheated. Concerts at this time, were more for girls to go and scream at their idols and the bands really didn't experiment much. There are serviceable versions of their big hits with ""Get Off My Cloud"", ""Under My Thumb"", ""19th Nervous Breakdown"" and ""Have You seen Your Mother Baby, Standing In The Shadows"" standing out. Not the high point of their career, but not the piece of junk that some have categorized it as."
5,For the Die-Hard Stone's Fan...,"Rough, uneven, muddy, are all apllicable to this album. It lacks the polish of later live albums such as ""Get Yer Ya Ya's Out!"" But if you're a true Stone's fan, you'll probably want to add it to your Stone's collection."
2,Not the SACD version,"I ordered this item expecting a SACD title. I just got a DSD remastered audio CD. Amazon should change the item name at least, since it was misleading in my case."
5,Got Live If Yo Want It.. Oh yea,"Man let it go about the tech crap, this is and will always be a great time piece recording of the Stones. All of the original band is here. They couldn't play anywhere without all the screaming, it was just the way it was back then. Give a listen to the Beatles at Shea or Hollywood Bowl. Hell they couldn't tell if there mikes were on. Tech had not caught up with them however it did with the Stones because they stuck around for a long while. Yea Get Your Ya's ya's out and Love you live are both great live recordings. This (Got Live) is what it was. The sound is not bad, just listen to Brian and Keith exchanging licks and Keith backing Mick on vocals and Bill and Charlie's soild backup. This is the real deal. Don't listen to all that crying about tech and recording contracts. Just read the song list and give a listen and you will really like this classic live Stones disc."
1,Cash From Chaos,"When a band needs to meet contractural obligations to a record company, it mostly means nothing really good will be produced.The Rolling Stones were faced with this dilemma through their U.S. distributor, London Records. Before the sessions were completed which produced Between the Buttons, this ""live"" album was issued on December 12, 1966.And talk about a rush job; the live material was recorded in early-October gigs in Newcastle upon Tyne and Bristol, with studio overdubs done later that month. Two songs - I've Been Loving You Too Long and Fortune Teller - were cut in the studio during different sessions (several years apart), with raucous screaming by girls overdubbed on the tracks.Basically a great example at the lengths record companies would go to get product into the marketplace, the band ultimately distanced themselves from the project, though it earned them a gold album and peaked at number six on the 1967 Billboard Pop Albums chart."
4,Indeed Essential,"A collection of groundbreaking work by pioneers in electronic music. Some of it is whimsical, some perhaps trivial, but much of it quite good. The album, itself, is historically important."
4,Disney's Electric Light Parade???!,"I have no idea why, but Perrey Kingsley's old-school eletronic music sounds a lot like somthing from you would hear in Disney's Electric Light Parade CD. This CD was a great hit when it first came out giving Electric Light Parade viewers the chance to own the electronica music on a CD. But they came and went so fast it is hard to find any of the CDs from that collection. I know for a fact that the song ""Baroque Hoedown"" is from Disney's Electric Light Parade. but I can hardly remember the rest of the songs since it was so long ago I have heard the CD. But, since Disney's Electric Light Parade started around the 1970's, i wouldn't doubt that more of perrey Kingsley's work is in it. if you like perrey's work and find Disney's Electric Light Parade CD, i would really recommend buying it."
4,Coooooooooooooooooooooooooool,It is cool but the arms just slide out like video's tapes.But the head is like it is melted on which is good and it twists. You can take of his shirt and he will look like he's fighting frieza. It's feet are a hell lot better than the japanese version.
2,Not so ergo,This mouse portion of this product is better suited for a man or a woman with man-hands. It's way too big for me. The key board is fine.
3,Connectivity issues,"I love the Natural keyboard once you get used to it you won't want to go back. But the mouse takes a little longer to get used to. The mouse is also heavy. The problem is with the connectivity, you move the mouse and it jumps to different places instead of smoothly. The same with the keyboard. Letters show up a second or two after you typed them. A minute or two of that can really annoy you. That is why I sent it back for a refund."
1,Worst Mouse Ever,"This is possibly the worst mouse I have ever been forced to use. Here's why:- The bottom isn't made from a material that slides very easily.- It's incredibly heavy further compounding the poor accuracy.- The way the laser tracks, moving the cursor along a horizontal line is impossible. It skews down when moving the mouse to the right and up when moving the mouse to the left.Onto the keyboard:- The keys are mushy when pressed- The keys wiggle around loosely- The size requires very long stretching of fingers to type."
3,Microsoft Desktop 7000,I have been using MS Desktop 6000 for at least 5 years until the mouse button is so worn out that it does not click anymore! I love that set. So when I have to get another desktop set I automatically go for MS DeskTop set. The Microsoft Desktop 7000 looks great in pictures and so I bought it. Its not as good as my previous desktop 6000. The 7000 scores high marks for styling and installing. But it's size is for adults that like big bulky items and have hands to match. The keys give a 'light' feedback but my desktop set space bar is too soft for my liking. But my biggest complain is for the mouse. While is fits my palm beautifully and more naturally its terrible when comes to sliding or moving. The 'slippers' feel stuck to the table. I cannot play games with it! It has been more than a month now and I am still trying to get used to it. Sad...
3,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000,"I was surprised at how large the mouse was, but I do find it has helped with my carpal tunnel pain. Only problem was wireless receiver kept waking my computer from sleep mode until I disabled that function."
4,Microsoft Natural Ergo Desktop 7000 Wireless,"I've just started using the keyboard today. I have used the Natural Keyboards before but this is my first wireless. The keyboard is comfortable as you can expect from the natural tilt of the keyboard and padded wrests. Keys are a bit stiff but it's new, they should smooth out with use. Jury is still out on the wireless part. I've noticed a delay when typing URL addresses today (2 times) -- depressing a key and not registering for a few seconds...not sure if was a wireless COM issue or my system doing something weird."
1,Issues,"The space bar sticks on this keyboard, would like to return and receive a new keyboard in return, same model etc. Do not have a box to return it in."
3,Comfortable with bad reception,"I have my computer beside my desk (less than 4 feet from where I place my keyboard/mouse combo). The keyboard/mouse combo are both very comfortable and are made with the craftsmanship you'd expect from a high end Microsoft product but I was very disappointed with the Bluetooth reception. After hooking up this new keyboard/mouse combo and installing the drivers, I ended up having to hook up my old keyboard and mouse (also Microsoft) because they would work intermittently at best. I ended up having to buy a separate cable to move the Bluetooth receiver to between the monitors so that I could get consistent use from both. I found this poor reception to be surprising since my keyboard/mouse are less than 5 feet from the receiver and the package advertises a 30 foot range. All in all, between the cost of this combo and the cable, I still feel like I got a pretty good deal on a good product.Here is the cable I got:Belkin F3U134-10 USB Extension Cable (10-Feet)"
2,Product not up to Microsoft standards,I have been using Microsoft keyboards since the first ergonomic keyboards were introduced. The keyboard I just retired was over 8 years old and it was worn out. This new keyboard has all the features I want but it just never worked properly. The spacebar key is more difficult to press than the other keys. It didn't seem like a big deal at first but it got worse over time and really started to wear on me. The other big problem was that the keyboard and mouse would stop responding for periods up to 30 seconds. This would happen several times a day. I moved the USB receiver from the back of my computer to the front and the problem improved but never fully resolved. I have been forced to switch to a Logitech keyboard (which I don't like as well) but at least it works.
5,Easy,Very easy to get up and running...no more wires to mess with. Love it! It was exactly what I needed.
5,Works well,"The keyboard works and the mouse does as well. I think both items take a little bit to get used to, like any new frequently used item. I haven't had any issues with the registering of my keystrokes or mouse. The pad of the keyboard definitely is comfortable and the mouse feels great as well."
2,Space bar flaw,"I enjoyed the design but hated the space bar action. It felt like you needed a hammer to get the space bar to assert the space character. As a programmer, I have fetish for a good keyboard and fell... I was excited when I seen this design but left disappointed when the action was so bad on the space bar. The other keys were fine but since we use the space bar 40% of the time, it should be light to the touch and shouldnt take 50 grams of force to assert it. I give the overall design 4.5 stars and the space bar 0.5 stars."
1,"Very comfortable, but keyboard connectivity sucks, making it useless","PROS: i love the design, both keyboard and mouse are very comfortable to useCONS: keyboard loses connection intermittently from day 1 (with usb receiver less than 4 feet away), exchanged it for a different set and still the same issuemouse stopped working less than a year after purchase, got warranty replacement from microsoft hoping it would fix the keyboard connectivity issue but STILL loses connection in the middle of typing something, this is extremely annoyingi've since switch to logitech k350 keyboard and performance mx mouse, i prefer the ergonomics of the microsoft keyboard/mouse but the logitech just works! the mouse works on any surface which is awesome!"
4,Just Fits,"The style of this keyboard just fits my hands and the angle at which my arms approach the keyboard. Keys were a little stiff initially, but seem to be loosening up. The mouse took a little getting used to."
4,Overall I like it,"There are some glitches that occasionally come up with typing as noted in other reviews. Overall, I like it and it has saved me a lot of pain in my arms and shoulders."
2,not ergonomic mouse,"Very uncomfortable mouse, you have to turn turn your wrist at 45 degrees and all the weight of your hand rests on the heel of your wrist (will get sore), also have to mostly move with thumb. Maybe for someone who has never used a conventional mouse before. Love the keyboard though."
5,Perfect product,This is my second one of these.I spilled coffee on the first one I had for two years. I looked at all of the others and decided to stick with what I knew works best for me because my wrists get very tired easily.
1,DONT BUY THIS!!,"THESE KEYBOARDS AND ESPECIALLY THE MOUSE HAS MAJOR CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS!....MONTHS WITH MICROSOFT CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND NO FIX!.......THESE CONSTANTLY LOSE CONNECTION AND ACT ERRATICALLY...I HAD TO SEND BACK TO MICROSOFT FOR REPLACEMENT, BUT HAVE NO FAITH IN THE RESULTS.....I HOOKED BACK UP MY $20 LOGITECH COMBO AND HAVE NO PROBLEMS .....WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!"
2,Spacebar issues NOT resolved,"This was a great product and I loved the mouse. But the center spacebar felt like it was an afterthought. It wobbled and my thumbs were so sore from having to work so hard just to get it to work.I ended up getting a Logitech wave keyboard and though I really like the use of my spacebar on this one, I wish I could have had the true ergonomic split of the Microsoft keyboard.If they would just fix that spacebar I would have kept it until it waxed old and died just like its predecessor, which was also a Microsoft product.Quality control, Microsoft, quality control."
2,Not what it used to be...,"To bad Microsoft decided to go cheap on this kind of hardware....This keyboard is not what it used to be. No Caps Lock, Num Lock and Scroll Lock light indicator, just low battery led.Cheap materials and assembly. The mouse is now silver and won't slide as easy as the prior version. No software CD. The wireless is weak.For me, big dissapointment."
3,"Decent keyboard, intermittent connectivity is frustrating","Keyboard is decent, some of my programs like AutoCAD don't work well with the function keys but I don't know if this is the keyboard or my settings. The keyboard is working fine now but yesterday and at other random times it has a delay and sometimes doesn't type at all. I have followed the instructions on the Microsoft website for re-connection to the usb but sometimes it fixes the problem and sometimes it doesn't. When I follow the instructions to re-connect it it says that the receiver should have a solid green light to confirm that the connection was successful. This light has never been solid green yet my keyboard works... sometimes. Also, this keyboard has so many buttons that I don't use, it is annoying."
1,Completely Unreliable.,"Pros: When the keyboard is working, it is very comfortable to use. The use of the mouse is somewhat comfortable. I would give the comfort of the keyboard 9/10, but I would give the comfort of the mouse 5/10 because I don't think they have the perpendicular posture quite rightCons: What good is a wireless keyboard when you constantly need a backup keyboard and mouse at your desk. I'm not typing this review of the keyboard on the actually keyboard because it keeps cutting out on me. I've had the keyboard/mouse combo for only 1.5 weeks, and I can't rely on them to work properly. The USB receiver sits 1 foot from the keyboard and mouse, but both the keyboard and mouse will cut out on me at any point. I find these episodes of unreliability occur about 5+ times per day making the use of these products completely unacceptable.I would not recommend you buy this product."
3,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000,"Pro: Nicely constructed. Look quality .Mouse sharp and preciseCons: The keys are tight! You have to press hard when keying. It's pricey compared to Logitech. You can get the same keyboard and mouse around $80 from Logitec. I think Logitech is better in making keyboards.For the mouse is quiter than logitech's mouse, more precise, smooth tracking! Excellent mouse. The downside of this mouse is very high! it won't fit for a small hand person!Would not recomemend the keyboard!You should get the Mircrosoft Laser Wireless mouse 8000 rather than the mouse in this ergonomic desktop 7000 comboI bought the Mircrosoft Laser Wireless mouse 8000. I LOVE IT!"
2,NOT ERGONOMICAL,"MY HANDS HURT WITHIN TWO DAYS OF USING THIS KEYBOARD. I TYPE 8 HOURS A DAY AND I TYPE REALLY, REALLY FAST. THE KEYBOARD MAPPING IS HORRIBLE BECAUSE THE BACKSPACE IS HARD TO REACH. THE WRIST REST WAS THE ONLY THING THAT WAS COMFORTABLE."
1,Almost good..,"This keyboard is almost good. Spacebar is seriously screwy as others have stated, claims to be mac compatible but only has 1 CMD button (windows key)"
2,Sticky keyboard,"I think the keyboard is designed for men with large hands. I have a hard time depressing the keys, especially the space bar. The placement of the keys is also not easy to get used to and I keep making typos after switching to it. The space bar is very sticky and after tying for an hour, my wrists hurt more than when I used the conventional keyboard. I know that the 4000 model got many rave reviews, but I wanted a wireless one and opted for this 7000 model. I don't know if the 4000 model is better, but I am very disappointed with this 7000 model. The only good thing is the mouse -- as everyone says, it is a pleasure to use the mouse."
2,Not for female hands,"I just returned this keyboard/mouse combo. I've had a Microsoft ergonomic keyboard for many years and would never use anything else. However, my hand kept hitting the USB connecting wire, so I thought a new, clean wireless keyboard was the answer. I already had a wireless Logitech mouse and really liked the wireless feature.But this is not the one for me. The 7000 mouse is gargantuan and I could not get an ergonomic feel even when I used a wrist support. The keyboard started out fine, but in less than a week it lost all of the commands that had been programmed into its shortcut buttons, and it did not offer a way to reformat them. I had already scrapped the mouse and had gone back to my old Logitech mouse, and when the keyboard went stupid, I decided that I can live with a wired keyboard in order to get the stability of the old system."
1,Defective Spacebar,"I love the angle in which this keyboard is designed; it's very comfortable. However, the spacebar, literally, has to be forcefully supressed in order to function. If you're a ""two-finger"" typist, this is not a problem - for competent typist, it's a major irritation. And to make matters even worse, once returned, it took Amazon over a month to get my money back into my account. They don't need to sell any products, and they really don't care if you return the product purchased. They make far more money investing and utilizing your money for 2-3 weeks....what a scam.Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000"
5,all love no hate in my eyes!,"I just love this whole keyboard and mouse. The only thing that I dont like is the mouse is super fast. I had to turn down the speed at with the mouse moves or tracks cause you move a lil and it goes. I had the old model that was one of the first split key keyboards and fell in love with it, now love this one even more. For people that are used to the regular keyboard it takes some getting used to. I can say that I type a lil faster because of this keyboard cause i never learned how to use one really so b-4 I was a two finger personlookiing like a monkey typing now I'm up to a ferw words and not always looking down. I do play comp games and like the key feel and it doesnt take a lot to type what you need. All in all people dont like the mouse but i think it totally worth the money for the whole thing. Even if your lady gets mad at you like mine for spending so much on a keyboard and mouse."
3,REVIEW,"Was double shipped items, website is very difficult to get thru to return anythinghowever, once you get to speak with a human - they are very easy to deal with"
3,mouse doesn't work with Microsoft Virtual PC,I got this keyboard and mouse to replace a corded MS ergonomic keyboard that had a couple of keys fail after over a decade of use.But the mouse - specifically the scroll wheel - is not compatible with Microsoft Virtual PC.In my opinion that is design defect that renders the mouse unusable.I use Virtual PCs all the time especially for web browsing. Right now I am using a virtual PC with my old Logitec mouse to write this review.The keyboard is nice.
2,Prone to Interference,"Pro: Microsoft's ergonomic keyboards are great for style and comfort. The larger-than-average mouse provides hand support that helps reduce repetitive strain injury. The materials are durable and the devices are well-constructed. Driver installation is easy and automatic.Con: The transmitter used to communicate between the USB dongle and the keyboard/mouse is too weak. While it has a high theoretical range, any electronic device between it and the keyboard and mouse can severely interfere with their function. A monitor placed near the wireless keyboard is enough to cause intermittent disruption, resulting in lost keystrokes or even an unresponsive keyboard for a few seconds. As a programmer it was not usable for me, as I imagine it would be for any heavy typer. I would strongly recommend the wired alternatives from Microsoft."
2,Sticking space bar.,"The space bar of the keyboard that I received needed way more than normal force to be pushed. It seemed as if it locked up when pushed on at the far left or right edge. I'll be trying to fix it with some silicone grease, but have little hope. Not a good buy."
1,Crapped out after a year of not being used at all,"Bought this for my new desktop and loved it at first. Then due to taking care of my elderly father it sat unused (but boxed) for about a year. When I went to hook it back up, there must have been a dozen keys that didn't work anymore.The mouse (also stored inactive for the same amount of time) still works fine, but that was an awfully expensive keyboard to get 2 or 3 months of light use out of."
2,Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 7000 - POOR PERFORMANCE Overall,"To my dismay, the paint chipped off on many letter keys after 2 weeks of owning the keyboard. If I type too quickly, the keys ""lag"", & often there's double letters, & caps seem non existent. The Mouse is too sensitive & when tapped accidentally with your hand or finger, it shifts pages. Overall, I'm disappointed with the keyboard & mouse."
2,I am disapointed with this purchase.,"The software will not install on my Dell Precision 450 workstation so all of the extra keys are unavailable.I am unimpressed with the keyboard but, I am sure, I will eventually learn to deal with it. What is the greater disapointment is the mouse; quite honestly I could aim a flashlight easier. The pointer is sloppy and inacurate and after using the mouse for a few hours there are times when the right button quits respondinding.If I put the USB dongle in a slot on the back of the computer, the keyboard and mouse quit responding, so I'm stuck with the dongle up front.I am using the mouse keyboard to write this review and the mouse is absolutely frustrating at how inacurate it is.And to add insult to injury, Amazon dropped the price within hours of purchase."
3,Great keyboard...UNTIL USB Broke!,"I was loving this keyboard until I went to use it on another computer and the USB transceiver broke. I called MS support and there are no replacement parts for keyboards so this is worthless right now. Very disappointed, going back to a wired ergo keyboard."
1,The space bar is an issue,I just purchased this keyboard a week ago and I'm sending it back. I've used ergo keyboards for years as well and I cannot reach the middle of the keyboard to usethe space bar comfortably. If you hit it anywhere other than dead center it's extremely stiff and tiring when you're typing.
1,Warning,"This is the single worst keyboard and mouse I have ever seen. It is literally worthless. The cursor hangs up more often than not and the keystrokes are late in appearing. This despite the fact that the components are within 30 inches of the USB transceiver. I had read several negative reviews but went with MS because I had always had good luck with them. My fault. But, I'm sending it back for a refund which I will use for a Logitech."
4,MS wireless keyboard & mouse review,"Keyboard - great design, feel, functionality -- the negitive is the wireless function kept losing connection -- I had to move my move my computer from the floor to on top of my dest for it to stay connected. The mouse is good - I am use to the MS trackball which I like better - but my trackball is not wireless so I am giving the mouse a try."
2,Ended up returning it,"First off I'm a Mac user, so I knew it wouldn't be 100% what I hoped for but unfortunately I wasn't able to ever use the music functions because they only worked with iTunes and not like the standard media buttons that control what ever is playing music. Plus the music only has a play button and no other controls. I ended up returning it wishing more from it."
1,Spacebar is awefully sticky,"I bought this product a few days ago. I hoped that all the bad reviews are based on the old version of the product, but even today, in April of 2012 the spacebar problem is not fixed! It is impossible to use this keyboard for programming, and quick typing.Keyboard works out of box on modern Linux, except for the five programmable keys on the top of keyboard and the zoom buttons. I was able to make zoom work in Arch Linux, but I could not make 5 programmable keys to work.I did not experience the disconnect problem so it probably has been fixed.Mouse is OK, but wheel is very slow and hard to rotate. I am returning this product because of spacebar."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I thought this, being an upper end product would be great. I returned my first one after a week thinking that there was just a problem with it, but my second one reacts the same way.I constantly have to hit the connect button on the bottom, or my keyboard quits typing all together. Most of the time even when connected, it misses letters and doesn't keep up. I am so frustrated with this product that I took the time to come on here an write a review - something I typically don't do. If I can save one person the frustration that I am going through, it will be worth it.Oh, and I gave the product a star because I do like the mouse."
1,DON'T BUY THE KEYBOARD,"I love the design and feel of the keyboard, but after about less than 6 months of use, it developed a mind of it's own and works when it wants to....dropping letters or not picking up anything when I type. I've tried new batteries, a different port on the desktop for the usb attachment, even relocating the machine so it's in a more direct line with the signal. I even tried using the keyboard in a room with no other wireless equipment. Bottom line is the thing is hopeless. I've resorted to an older less ergonomically correct keyboard I have....very disappointing and an expensive mistake."
2,Waste of money,"Spacebar sticky, mouse disconnects if touched slightly. Like the keyboard style but the am getting fed up both it and the mouse. Someone mentioned site that give help for these problems so will check it out, on another computer, and see what happens."
4,Key board,Overall very nice keyboard. But after downloading software it will not recogize the caps lock. You have to constantly make sure the caps lock is in the proper position.
2,Mouse won't work on desktop,"Both keyboard and mouse were easy to install. Keyboard is a bit bulky but has a nice solid feel. The mouse, however, won't work on my desk -- which I'm guessing in because it's a bit shiny. My previous Logitech mouse worked great, and I find mousepads annoying. Not sure if I should just return it."
4,Worth it for me!,"I prefer a split keyboard and wireless one at that which can be hard to find. My last one was about dead and I had to work on getting a replacement so bought this one about a year ago. So far it has held up very well which is about what I have found with the Microsoft brand hardware items, the design is pretty good with some nice extras and the padding on the wrists holds up though it really isn't used much being so low."
1,Poor Form on Microsoft!!,"I have been in need of a new Ergonomic Keyboard for some time and finally decided to purchase one. I found the Microsoft 7000 and decides that it would be an adiquate repalcement.I didn't even have it a full eight hours when the Mouse stopped functioning. I called Microsoft, they kept me on the phone for over an hour troubleshooting only to tell me the mouse had to be replaced.They wanted ME to pay to ship it back. They wanted me to wait 10 days before they would ship me out a replacement, and they wanted me tape a shipping order form to the outside and the inside of the box with all the product numbers written out and with an explination as to why its being returned.Its because of Microsoft that I am returning it to the Amazon account I purchased it from without a replacement. I'd rather not deal with Microsoft anymore, from now on I will buy Apple."
2,Clunky,"My former keyboard was similar but a different brand. The real problem is the mouse. It says it is ergonomic but it is the most uncomfortable mouse I have ever used. It is huge and you hand is suppose to be laying on it's side, but that means that your hand is dragging on the desk and slowing it down. It is terrible."
1,Keyboard does not work! Sold with expired batteries,"Amazon sold me this item, ordered in August and it was shipped with batteries that expired in May. It took me months to figure out why my keyboard was so slow and slow to catch up with my typing. After replacing the batteries the problem still exists. I spend double the amount of time typing. Its a mess! I cannot return now or get a replacement from amazon and I am really annoyed. Do not order! I had one before, the system is great, just dont get it here."
3,Mouse stopped working next day,"The keyboard works great and has eliminated my wrist pain entirely.However, the mouse stopped responding after a day, maybe two, and now I'm out a comfortable mouse! I've purchased the Evoluent 4 Small, but it's actually causing more pain than the one that came in this package.I would rather get a replacement than purchase a new one, since I may as well purchase a complete keyboard/mouse set if it's going to be only $10 more than buying the mouse separately!"
2,Erratic,"Frequent loss of signal to keyboard and mouse from USB dongle attached to front of upright PC tower., Irratic behavior of mouse which did not operate further than 36"" frrom dongle.Requested and got immediate replacement by Amazon,. Second unit stays connected but still irratic and ""jittery"" behavior of mouse.Have used MS wireless keyboard-mouse combinations in past without any of these problems. Would expect at least the same quality for the price paid."
4,"ok to work with, mouse not for small hands","The keyboard was very relaxing, as problems could say that the mouse is not compatible with small hands, and that these products could be more compact I think."
1,Space bar is a black eye for Microsoft.,"After many years of service, my Microsoft ergonomic, wireless keyboard had to be replaced. I wanted to replace it with the same type, so I bought the MS Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000. The unpleasant surprise was the space bar. It is heavy to the touch and makes a loud clack when pressed. My thumb soon began to ache and cramp, and I had to stop using the keyboard. I took it back to the electronics store, intending to exchange what I thought was just a defective fluke, but they were all like that. Turns out that it's a bad design. So, I am left searching for a suitable replacement, using the old one for the time being. The 7000's space bar is a black eye for Microsoft. (For work, I have long used a Kinesis keyboard -- which I highly recommend for anyone having RSI/arthritis problems -- but that one takes getting used to and thus is not a viable choice for our multi-user home computer.)"
3,Great except keys started wearing off after a few weeks,"I love this keyboard. I type more quickly and with more comfort. I have been using this keyboard and mouse for a couple of months without having to change the batteries. I work on my computer 10+ hours a day, 5 days a week. Within weeks of receiving this item, the letters on the keys began to wear off. My ""E"" key is completely gone and about 5 other keys have early signs of wearing off. While I don't usually look at the keys as I type, it is annoying that the keyboard already looks old and worn.Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000"
5,15 Years,"I've been using Microsoft natural keyboards for 15 years and can't type with anything else. This wireless keyboard is smooth but the space bar is a little too loose and I think in another review I read the same thing. The mouse is like driving a Mercedes it will take a little to get use to but I have no doubt that when I do get use to it I will love it. I do think that they need to tighten up the space bar and when they do I'll buy another one. So I'm going to rate this at 4.75 stars, I really do love it."
5,Excellent Product,"Excellent product in every respect. Total comfort with the split keyboard, angle at which your wrists rest while typing and the mouse is just perfect. Would recommend this to anyone."
5,"Love, love, love this keyboard","I had one of these keyboards when they first came out and had to be connected to your computer. At the time I was a big ""chatter"" and over the time I had it, my nails actually cut grooves in some of the letters!My favorite feature is that the keyboard can be positioned to slant down with the front (side closest to you) being higher than the back (side closest to the monitor). Your wrists don't bend at all. I have carpal tunnel so it makes it so much more comfortable. There is definitely a bit of a learning curve getting used to the shape and the way your hands are positioned, but it is SO worth it."
3,Having some issue with the keyboard,"I'm using this on my Windows 7 desktop. The mouse works great, and doesn't strain my wrist too much.The keyboard sometime gives me problem though. It would become unresponsive for a brief moment, and not outputting anything that I typed, or output it a couple seconds later. It can be a little bit frustrating. I suspect it has to do with me placing it close to my monitor, which somehow interferes with the keyboard's wireless connection."
3,Annoying freeze ups,"I love the keyboard and mouse, the erogonomic design is great, very comfortable to use and does help elievate the repetative strain issues I have. The problem is that the keyboard particularly, and occasionally the mouse will freeze up. I've searched Microsoft's knowledge base but don't see a solution that clearly addresses the problem and I have yet to call customer support, which is provided for the first 90 days. But I ask you, who wants to buy a new product of any kind and spend their time fixing it when it doesn't work the way it should? If I had known that I would have these problems with this product I would have selected something else."
2,Mouse is great. Keyboard stinks.,"I don't know why Microsoft can't put a good set of stuff all in the same box. I have one of these sets. And a Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 7000. The mouse in this set is fantastic. The keyboard in the other set is fantastic. The keyboard here and the mouse there....might as well be sold at the dollar store. It really sucks that Microsoft makes these poor products, since it pushes out other low-priced, quality vendors."
2,POOR KEY FEATURES,"i PURCHASED THIS KEY BOARD 3 MONTHS AGO AND i HAVE TO NOW GET A NEW ONE. i WILL GO WITH A DIFFERENT COMPANY, THE KEYS FADED AWAY SO THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!!"
2,More bad than good,"Pros: the keyboard has a well thought out ergonomic design... too early to tell if does any good.configurable extra buttons on keyboardCons:software corrupted all of my keyboard/mouse drivers. had to reinstall windows""ergonomic"" mouse cause more discomfort than it alleviatespoor wireless performance"
1,Not a good keyboard,"Keyes stick, mouse is horrible. What was someone thinking with that egg of a mouse? Why are there no good wireless natural keyboards?"
1,Don't buy this! Read other reviews,"This keyboard freezes pretty regularly. It'll drop keystrokes and then it will add in duplicates of other. I've tried it on other computers in the house and it's hit or miss. It'll work great for a few minutes and then it'll start dropping keystrokes or freeze alltogether. I've had other MS keyboards that are great, but this is the worst ever!It is comfortable and it's soft on the wrists, but the fact that it just plain doesn't work makes it worthy of ZERO stars. Too bad that's not an option!"
5,The Best Keyboard & Mouse I've Used,"The keyboard and mouse are excellent! The keyboard is ergonomic, thin and very well shaped. The keys have a good feel and the letters/numbers are very visible. The mouse is slightly tilted to the right and has never caused me any pain unlike other mice I have used. (I don't know if there is a left-hand version.) I have two of these units; one at the office and one at home. I would buy this desktop again if I needed a 3rd one."
5,It's a winner,"I bought this for my wife as gift; she loves it. She types 90 plus words a minute and the keyboard has no delays; unlike some of the other brands that she tried; very responsive. It uses an USB transmitter which is small and convenient. Uses only 2 batteries in the mouse, 2 in the keyboard and with the 2.4 GHz signal; battery life is exceptionally long. Highly recommend this product."
4,Feels great! Love it!,"I absolutely love the keyboard, it is very comfortable. With the angle at which my tray is at, the mouse hurts my wrist and so I switched back to a smaller mouse as the mouse is huge (IMO)."
5,"Comfortable keyboard, but big...","It's a great keyboard if you usually type a lot, in my case I'm a programmer and this keyboard keeps your wrists in a comfortable position. I've had this keyboard for a little more than a month and the batteries have around 90% of charge, so, so far it seems to be a good green product.The only down side is the size, is a big keyboard, you need to consider this if you have a small desk or if you have a sliding keyboard tray, you might have issues trying to move the mouse. Compared to regular keyboard it's around; 2"" wider, 4"" deeper and 2"" higher.As a note: it might be a little difficult to use at the beggining, but give it a try, it's worth it once that you get use to it.And for the mouse, well, I don't use it much, 90% of my time I use the keyboard only. But, it came with the keyboard, so, I think of it as a nice gift. It looks great, has a nice design, good grip, but I can't say that I've used all the features..."
2,poor quality product,"I got two copies of this keyboard and neither was good. the first copy had a very ""sticky"" space bar and was unusable. Both copies felt cheap and the keys required a fair amount of effort to type. It don't seem very 'ergonomic"" to me to have to work twice as hard to get the same outcome. I feel this is a bad product."
3,"Connection drops twice daily, but perfect ergonomics.","I've had this 2 days and the connection has dropped at least twice each day. It's a bit tricky to reconnect especially when the receiver is in the back of the computer, which is around the other side of the desk. I just connected a usb extention cable and ran it on top of my desk. We'll see if it helps. It will at least make it easier to reset."
1,Ergonomic but not functional,"Pros: general feel and comfortCons: disconnectivity, double keystrokes, non-responsivenessI had hoped that wireless technology had improved enough to replace my 5-year old wired Natural keyboard. Do yourself a favor: do NOT buy this product. It simply does not perform well. Any time and convenience that I save from not hassling with a cord is lost more than ten fold by keystroke errors and disconnections.And, while I got used to the mouse, it is so huge that my hand frequently bumps into it en route from the keyboard - and, of course, your hand bumps the back or forward button on the mouse changing your browser tabs and losing your data in forms, etc."
4,comfortable keyboard with lot more to be desired,"I just bought this keyboard new this week. I have read a few previous reviews. Boy, the same old problems are still there. I wish someone in Microsoft reads the review feedbacks.1) space bar IS very difficult to use. Sticky and hard to press.2) The bulky useless number pad still there. I almost wanted to just cut it off, so I can put my mouse there. Short of that, I was planning to put the mouse on the left. But you know what?! the mouse is right handed only! So I have to stretch my right arm for the mouse. But I am a small person. Did Microsoft only tested the mouse with people 6 feet and taller?3) the useless Zoom button is still there right in the middle. Why not change it to a mouse ball, or a scrolling wheel?Despite all these defects (according to my use as a software engineer), I love the contoured keyboard and support for waist."
1,Keyboard is O.K. but mouse does not work well!,"I am very disappointed in the mouse performance. It is jittery, jerky and often unresponsive.I am running Windows 7 and have loaded the CD , adjusted everything using the control panel mouse section, changed the usb to the front of the processor and done everything I know to do. It just doesn't work as well as my old Logitech."
2,"great keyboard, crappy mouse","The keyboard is wonderful, very easy to use and really good for aching wrists. The mouse, however, jammed up after less than a day and is completely useless. I have to return the whole package, and I am NOT PLEASED.Microsoft Wireless Laser Desktop 7000"
2,Defective,"Short battery life, sticky space bar, and the mouse feels horrible in my hand. I have the wired version at work, it also has space bar problems."
2,"Great keyboard, nasty mouse","I bought this combination to replace a similar corded, Microsoft wireless keyboard and a very old corded Logitech mouse. The keyboard is wonderful. It has buttons for shortcuts and make like easier.Mouse is a different story. I like that it is wireless. The shape, however, is not good for comfort and using for an extended period of time. The mouse is higher that other mouses, but is shorter from the front of the mouse to the back. It forces the hand into a ball. If this mouse was longer it would infinitely more comfortable. Additionally, the mouse forces the hand to be more on the back and side of the hand toward the little finger. Again, if this mouse was longer, I think this would be a great comfort feature.Since I have started using this mouse, my hand is really hurting and I am having problems now going back to the previous mouse.I would have given this a 2.5 but half stars weren't allowed.Again, great keyboard, but the mouse is a pain (literally)!"
2,Not pleased,"I've used this style of keyboard in the past, and I don't recall having a problem. I bought the keyboard and mouse to hook up to my laptop while at the office. Within two weeks the spacebar is sticking in the down position. It responds to a firm ""thump"" but it's really slowing me down. Also the spacebar, before it started sticking, is incredibly loud. The other keys are very quiet, it's odd.The mouse I immediately threw in my desk drawer. It's not comfortable for me at all. It feels too big for my hand, and the movement is lethargic even after adjustments in control panel (they made absolutely no difference at all).After having spent almost $100 on this, I'm really unhappy. I discarded all of the packing materials so I don't know if I'll be able to return it or not."
5,Good Product,I use both items at work and at home. The mouse takes some getting to use to but I like the larger mouse especially since I have had carpel tunnel surgery. The fact that the key board has so many adjustments makes it easy to find a comfortable level for typing. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless keyboard and mouse.
1,"Keyboard failed after 6 month, receiver after 7 months","10 keys of the keyboard stopped working after 6 months, not a software issue (tried on various OS systems including mac) and my wireless receiver malfunctioned this week and sends out unlimited mouse scrolls and needs to be pulled out every few minutes to reset now"
4,Found fix for worst flaw,"I had the same problem with the keyboard stopping and skipping over letters as you type that others have noted. I fixed it by moving the USB receiver to the front of my CPU instead of the back, where I originally placed it. Now, neither the keyboard nor mouse give me any trouble, and the ergonimic shape of both give me real relief from pain in my wrists and forearms. I agree that the placement of the receiver shouldn't be so tricky--I am not crazy about the receiver sticking out in front and taking up one of the most convenient USB ports, rather that working from the back where a normal, corded USB keyboard would attach. But moving it to the front did, indeed, fix all the skipping and stopping issues."
1,Worst Keyboard,"Most of the keys stick, hard to use, not worth the money, would like to return to Amazon but would not allowed."
1,The Ergo Mouse is the absolute worst mouse EVER,"Lots of problems here:1. The support pads on the bottom of the mouse are too big and too soft. This causes the mouse to stick to the desk surface as you use it. The mouse pointer jumps due to the stiction. The pads need to be smaller and harder material.2. The mouse wheel is sloppy. The mouse button doesn't work well. The click happens at too deep a level and is not consistent. No detent on mouse wheel.3. The MS Mouse software caused my synaptics touch pad to stop working. I had to uninstall it to get my touch pad back.All I can say is- Microsoft, What were you thinking?This product really makes me rethink getting other Microsoft hardware in the future."
5,"Great mouse, better layout","I really like this ergo mouse. That's why I bought this. I was happy with my older natural keyboard but the cost of the combo was only $20 more so I went for it. I like that the layout as the classic 3x2 navigation key block, I never liked the big delete key thing. The curve an shapes of the keys make for very comfortable typing. It is a little hard moving from this keyboard to others, more so than previous natural keyboards because of this.One thing I did notice, that did not impress me is that the receiver need to be pretty close to the keyboard. I tried putting it on the back of my PC and had issues with it dropping keys. No problem on front or a hub. Maybe its just interference from the PC itself."
3,MS 7000 Ergonomic keyboard,"To start let me say I absolutely love this keyboard, the mouse not so much, it stands to high actually and doesn't fit the hand. Now back to the keyboard, I love it is great and works really well: AFTER, I cleaned and vasolined all the keys and padded the space bar to keep it from clacking. So if your able to purchase an item take it apart and repair it this is the keyboard for you. The keys were sticky, the space bar clacked very loudly just generally very poor workmanship on this item, but what can I say, I love the shape of it, lol."
1,Keyboard spacebar problems are real,"The hard-to-depress space bar defect mentioned in many previous reviews is real and still present as of Dec 2010. In general this feels like a manufacturing defect: not only is the space bar hard to depress and very loud when you manage to get it depressed, but my keyboard is so poorly made that the space bar grabs the ""v"" key on the way down roughly 10% of the time (after they are stuck together you have to manually free them before proceeding)! I took formal typing lessons growing up and I've been touch typing for over 20 years at over 80 words per minute -- I have large hands too, that isn't the problem.I'm going to try it to see if the key softens at all, but if not I'm returning it ASAP. I recommend only buying this at a store where you can check it out."
3,"It's okay, not great.","Cons with the keyboard: The 6 key is located on the left. When I learned to touch-type, I learned to use my right hand to hit that key. Also, the spacebar requires a lot of force to press down. My right thumb is hurting now. Some ergonomics! The spacebar makes a loud click when you press it. That sound tends to distract people around me. Spaces happen!Every few hours, I lose the signal to either the mouse or the keyboard. What's up with that? It takes 20-30 seconds to get it back. That's no fun.Anyway, the stuff functions most of the time, but I'm considering returning it for something better."
1,Receiver fails!,"For some reason the keyboard and mouse lose connectivity to the wireless receiver at random! When this happens, the problem persists until I restart the computer. It is super annoying and unexpected for such an expensive purchase. I am very unhappy with this product."
2,"Good mouse, horrible keyboard","Like many others, I am experiencing an issue where the keyboard just stops responding to input making typing a nightmare. I am not sure what could be causing it, but I am sending this thing back and getting something else.Just a beware to all potential purchasers out there that the keyboard is just plain horrible from a connectivity standpoint. But great from a comfort standpoint."
1,"Awful, mushy, plasticy crap.","The scroll wheel is mushy, hard to spin and unresponsive. If I squeeze the whole mouse in my hand like an orange it deforms and the mouse buttons chafe each other. The keyboard is flexy, squeaky, and none of the auxiliary buttons work. My wrists want to slip off the wrist rests. The Mac software that I installed (quite reluctantly) is a complete joke; it offers to launch Sherlock(!!!) for the function keys, and uses freaky non-standard dialog boxes. I think the layout of the System Preferences pane it installed may have been broken; it looked like there was supposed to be more of it that disappeared off the bottom of the window.All in all, the only positive thing i can think of to say is that the set came with name-brand batteries. Too bad I sent them back when I returned this cheesy, cheap, insulting, plastic pile of crap."
4,It's nice.,the mouse is basically awesome.. feels great. a bit too hard to motion around though... slow.The keyboard... meh... still haven't gotten used to its feel and i keep hitting the wrong keys. the wrist rest is nice though.When i first got it it kept not communicating right with my computer... losing connection and not connecting at all sometimes.. but now it seems to be working fine. was really frustrating at first.
5,Fantastic Keyboard,"This is a wonderful keyboard. I was having sever wrist pain using a standard keyboard and found the slight realignment of the wrist does wonders. It is so good, that I told my mother about it because she claims to have the same pain. It showed up ahead of the date of expected arrival and it is perfect."
5,GREAT KEYBOARD!,"If you have had Carpal Tunnel Surgery, this is the keyboard for you!It makes typing so comfortable. It rests your wrists at the perfect angle.If I would have had this keyboard years ago I am sure I wouldn't have needed surgery.It takes a little time to get accustomed to the position of the keys. But really not a problem because it is such a natural position for your hands.Love it."
1,bad designe,not a good keyboard design. hard to use when typing. there is good features on the keyboard that others don't have.
3,Great keyboard but!!,"I love this keyboard; however, the letters on the keys fade very quickly to the point of not being distinguishable."
1,Terrible Wireless Connection,"I received the Desktop 7000 and followed the directions to install the software first, place the batteries in the devices then sync. Initially the devices worked fine but within five minutes the mouse and keyboard dropped signal.Worse yet, I couldn't re-sync the mouse and keyboard from my desktop which was only two feet from the wireless adapter. I literally had to hold the mouse and keyboard within 6 inches of the wireless adapter to re-sync.I've had a lot of Microsoft keyboards and I've been attracted to their ergonomic keyboards. This keyboard was very awkward to type with and I found myself mistyping repeatedly for the short period of time the keyboard actually worked. The mouse just seemed too tall for the average hand. It felt like using a softball for a mouse."
3,"What is it with Microsoft and the ""6"" key?","I will admit that Microsoft produces on a high level of quality, but when O' when are they going to realize that for us who have learned how to actually type from a class have learned that the ""6"" key is typed with the right index finger, along with the ""7"" key. The 6 key is always placed on the left side due to the ergonomic arrangement, and perhaps their desire for some form of symmetry. I have owned a previous ergonomic keyboard from Microsoft, so I speak from experience.All I can suggest is if space is an issue, maybe reduce the size of the backspace key so the 6 key can be properly assigned back to the right hand. It's a shame about these MS Natural keyboards, I'd probably buy this model, but having to reach my right hand out of position, or to use my left index finger for 4, 5 and 6 keys seems too much trouble when there are so many other keyboards out there."
4,moves to slowly on the mouse,Much better than my last key board. I just have to wait for my script to show up on the display.
3,Good keyboard.. but get the wired version,"Keyboard great.. love the split keys.Comfortable, nice feel/keys.. ONLY issue is that the wireless comms frequently freeze momentarily causing you to lose keystrokes. Kind of an important issue when you really only use the thing to input keystrokes! Tried moving the dongle about without much benefit. I'm not techy but I guess the signal needs to be stronger or just better.I love the keyboard but I'd get the wired version if I was going to buy again. The ""freedom"" isn't worth the patchy performance."
1,jojojojo,"I am giving this keyboard a 1 and here's why: Having had two hand operations Microsoft has decided to replace ergonomic with cool. There is nothing helpful to aching hands about this design. It is made to look cool. Since using this model I have developed issues in my pinkies from the design. Should not be happening with an ergonomic design.They had a keyboard, the wireless 1000, that worked really well for people with hand problems but they discontinued it. I think they have decided to interpret ergonomic as somewhat preventative instead of ergonomically correct. Obviously designed by people that have no hand problems.Shame on you Microsoft. If you really want to help people with their hands then read this review and learn from it."
3,A task-oriented reference guide,"This well-written book covers a lot of topics that I have not read in other books.Its strengths include:--Good coverage of cryptography programming--Task-oriented solutions to specific programming problems--Easy to navigate ""cookbook"" style (""with recipes"" as the authors call them)However, some areas of improvement might be:--Could use more coverage of important subjects (buffer overflows, etc.)--spends a lot of space on narrower examples (like explaining certain APIs that are documented well online)--Sometimes jumps into material without much background explanation (which was confusing for me)It is probably not the first book you should read on the subject. This is more of a recipe guide that is useful if you get stuck on coding a particular topic that happens to be covered. The authors have done a good job of explaining what coverage they do and don't include."
1,Completely useless for PKI programming,"The title ""Secure Programming Cookbook"" is more than a reach, but downright misleading. I bought this book fully expecting to find recipes for using OpenSSL's crypto library to generate CSRs, handle private CA functions such as create Digital ID Certificates, and other functions actually used in writing secure applications. What I found was the author spending more time talking about products and services offered by Verisign, and very little code whatsoever. There is some code for verifying a certificate, and downloading a revocation list, but sadly I've found more useful information reading OpenSSL's lackluster man pages than I have in this book. If you're looking for high level information about ""how stuff works"", or some simple command-line help, this book will suit you. If you're looking for content living up to the book's title - content that would actually help you implement things like PKI - you'll unfortunately come up short."
5,"masterful work, loads of info, well written","A masterful work. Bursting with loads of useful information, always gets right to the point, has just the right density of code examples, and is extremely well organized and well written (with one exception -- see below). Should be on every expert programmer's bookshelf. Even if you never need to do crypto in your programs, get this book and at least read all the ""Problem"" and ""Solution"" sections -- it'll only take a couple of hours, and you will be much smarter after you are done. I have only two complaints. First, section 10.1 on PKI is uncharacteristically sloppy, annoyingly redundant, and in a few places literally unparseable. Second, the authors, like the authors of every security textbook I've ever read, seem to believe that real C programmers will actually use things like the safestr library instead of nul-terminated arrays in their programs. Not going to happen, folks."
3,a good reference if you've really got to be secure,"If you are not sure that you need this book, then you probably don't. But if there is something it the table of contents that you've got to know, and you've got to get it right, then this would be a good book to have. Chapter 12 on Anti-Tampering was a really enjoyable read, though probably a futile task."
1,Not very interesting.,"This book is OK if you want to read about one person's experiences without having those experiences tied into the larger story of what's going on. Basically, ""I went here. I did this."" Not very interesting at all."
5,SO MUCH FUN!,"This sequel to ""Auntie Claus"" is fabulous! My kids and I loved the first book and ""Auntie Claus and The Key to Christmas"" is just as great! Even the website ... is unusal and loads of fun, with a quiz to see if the kids are on Santa's BB&G; (Bad Boys and Girls) List. My kids look forward to checking Mr. Pudding's Newsflash from the North Pole everyday.Ms. Primavera's rendition of the North Pole is a dreamscape of color, snow, and absolutely wondrous strange. With a message that conveys the power of the invisible, it is a Christmas story to be read year after year!"
3,"Not as good as the original ""Auntie Claus""","We enjoyed this book, and my kids were interested to know about the adventures of Sophie's brother. However, I didn't think the story was as cohesive and charming as the original. That being said, we still have fun with this book and anything my kids are interested in reading -- I'm good with that!"
5,My Favorite Christmas Read!,"I really like this book, and I've liked it for a long time. Every year we get all of the holiday books out and I always like reading this one on Christmas Eve. It really brings you back to the great Christmas spirit of believing. I would definitely recommend this book to people who love a creative Christmas tale. Primavera does a great job of creating characters. You will love Christopher's curiosity and in the end, proudness to be a Kringle despite others. Happy Holidays!"
4,Different take on Santa,"Though a companion book to ""Auntie Claus,"" ""Auntie Claus and the Key to Christmas"" stands well on its own. This unique story centers less on Santa Claus and more on being good at heart. There's magic and mysticism and jolly laughter thrown in for good measure. The accompanying illustrations are delightfully whimsical. And at $7.99 it's an inexpensive alternative for those looking to bolster their Christmas book collection."
2,Please think up something new.....,"Ms. Primavera had a clever idea when she wrote Auntie Claus. Unfortunately she has re-hashed the book and changed a few names.If you own ""Auntie Claus"" there is no new magic and no surprises here.There are many other clever picture books about Christmas to spend your money on, including Auntie Claus and Patricia Polacco's new book "" Christmas Tapestry""."
2,"Don't buy it if you don't ""do"" Santa with your kids.....","....unless you wish to be offended. I don't know about you, but I don't appreciate being portrayed as an ""unattractive adult"" and told that I enjoy seeing bad events unfold and/or raining on other people's parades. Aside from being judgemental, the book is beautifully illustrated and a good length for the price. Pages are on the thicker side, so that's nice. I wish it wasn't under the tone that it is."
5,Read This Book If You Want To Be Santa Claus,"If you cold live in toyland for two days, would you give up Christmas forever? Auntie Claus is getting ready for Christmas. She has special powers. She has a key that leads to Christmas and a ride on her elevator that can take her any where. Later a spoiled little boy came to the door of Christmas."
1,Hot Batteries,This snake was not worth the box it came in. It was meant to be a gift from Santa. It is cheaply made and did not work. When the batteries were put in it short circuited causing the batteries to beomce extremely hot.
2,looks better than it really is.,"This item does not run on carpeting or outside either. My son got bored quickly to just use in our kitchen on tile floor. Also, feels kind of flimsy like it will snap in half easily. Would be better if it was bendable. Looks like a cool snake from a distance."
2,Magicla Drop,This game is for kids about 7 or 8. It can be fun if you have an imagionation. Let your little one creat a little magic for himself/herslef.
3,running the numbers?,"The rehabber needs to know if the potential profits from a property exceed that of other investment opportunities and whether profits from selling immediately or renting short and long term are stronger. These basic but absolutely essential calculations are given less space here than considerations about whether to replace kitchen sinks and remove aluminum awnings. The latter don't really matter without a basic financial analysis. The book avoids gimmicks, however, and gives sound advice, but without arming you with the real economic tools you'll need."
2,Too much jargon,"This book did indeed have too much jargon in it. In parts of the book the writer tap into something good, but not go into enough detail for it to make sense. I read another book like this one that gave me insight into what this book was talking about. It is also outdated. The 203 HUD investment is not available anymore."
2,"Boring, Dated, and Basic","This is for beginners, it's filled with useless forms, and it provides very little information beyond a common-sense and reasoned approach to real estate. Surely there must be better resources than this."
3,The sad story of Mrs Langtry,"I watched several episodes of this after watching the excellentEdward the King, as Lillie was one of his famous mistresses. The cast is excellent, Francesca Annis is beautiful. The script is fine, and shows with sensitivity how this unhappy woman, avid of the pleasures of hi-society slowly turns into a prostitute. So, it is an excellent series, except for me. I have no interest in the biography of a prostitute: it is is saddening, and it is very boring to me. I wish somebody would make an intelligent and sensitive series about Marie Curie, for a change."
4,Excellent Story,Victorian story of a woman who moved in British society and found success touring in the United States. Highly recommended for those who enjoy history.
5,One of the Best of the Golden Era of Mini Series,"This was the first of the BBC mini-series I watched as a young adult (having missed Upstairs and the original Forsythe Saga while in college). What a fantastic production. The professional review may have found her flat; we find Annis' performance perfect. Having seen her on stage (ironically in a Wilde production), I can vouch for her talent, which is more than obvious here. Peter Egan is incredible - I so wish he had done much much more on film at the time. This is one of the series we rewatch on a regular basis and enjoy every time. This, along with Edward the King and Duchess of Duke Street, are the apex of the British mini-series era. What an age!"
5,One of the best,Loved every minute of this production. Purchased the set on VHS several years ago and again when it came out on DVD. I watch it two or three times a year. If you love films about the Victorian era do not hesitate to buy this.
4,Lillie,"This is a very interesting story. A lot history that I knew nothing about. I realise it is only a stoy based on fact, but still very good."
4,New Rapper,This CD was purchase randomly; I normally do this from time to time to see what is out there and is new. I found this CD to be very good. The music is something you will enjoy this Rapper has a good future ahead of him...
1,wasn't worth it,"I bought these batteries over a year ago, sent them back 3 days afer I got them because they would charge at all, I was told i WOULD RECIEVE A FULL Refund, to this day I am still waiting for the money spent on these 2 batteries.. I would not recommend this buisness or battery to anyone because they are all faulty.."
1,Didn't work well for me.,Charged the battery fully and tried to discharge. Tried this few times. Laptop was shutdown after 15 mins suddenly. It lost power from battery completely. Returned this and they sent me another one. The other gives backup for only 30 mins. Not happy with the product. Returned the second one also.
1,Garbage,"Garbage, I do not recommend buy this battery. Actually, I bought this product for my friend and he does not use this. On the picture show original Sony battery. I did receive third part battery without any labels. Also, it has been absolutely uncharged. Battery keeps power not more then 10-15 minut. Do not buy it!!!"
2,Sony Vaio Laptop Battery PCGA-BP2NY,"~Received an oem-Sony battery in a timely manner via usPS within a protective cardboard-box, however the battery was left to slam around inside the box! When i installed it, my Sony/Battery-status showed it was only 68%-charged, but did subsequently recharge to 100%; --however, upon unplugging the AC-adapter the battery supported continued operation for only about 5-minutes, -then the screen went black and operation ceased until i replugged the AC-adapter! Seller advertised this to be a- ""very-good used battery"", --which is not true, it is a very-old battery on its last-legs of usefulness, -only slightly better than the one it is replacing! This is the second 'bad battery' obtained via Amazon for my Sony/Vaio-laptop in the past 3-weeks; -will not buy another item from this seller either...!!!"
5,Great Battery,This battery is working great. I will look here when I need another one for my other computer.
3,arthurs nose,i really like this book because it is one of the older arthur book its the first one i read where arthur had a long nose. It also good because it tells little kids that it doesnt matter what you look like.
1,"Beware of so-called recharegeable ""D"" batteries","Be careful when shopping for rechargeable batteries! The Rayovac (and Energizer) products have the same Amp-Hour capacity as a ""AA"" battery! Do a little web searching and you'll find the Energizer is really an AA-sized cell in a ""D"" package - but sells for much more! I can't speak to the inner construction of the Rayovac, but it has a capcity of 2200 mAh -- definitely in the AA range (in fact, somewhat low for a good rechargeable AA these days). If you want the power capacity that a ""D"" size package should give you, look elsewhere -- the capacity should be in the 10,000+ mAh range."
1,Rated Power Too Low!,"This is the kind of power rating (2200 mah) that would be pretty good for a AA battery, but way to low for a D cell. At all-battery.com you get two 9000 mah batteries for 12.99. Rayovac is a good old name, and these aren't bad batteries. But, you'll get longer use with a higher rated battery."
1,These are AA batteries in a D sized case,Don't get fooled like I did. It turns out that a real D NiMH cell should store 7500-10000 mAh.
1,Very low power.,"The AA that you can get have a mah rating of 2500. The D battery should have at least 3 times that much. These are old and while they may be good batteries, they won't give you power very long."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"This is a AA battery in a D size case. It will last less than half the time of a ""real"" D size NiMH cell. The power available from a battery is indicated by the mAH rating, with more being better. The price of this item looks good until you realize you are paying for a D cell and getting AA performance."
3,its ok,i bought the recashrgeable batteried and the re charger. Batteries are ok as they last for 2 days and than need recahrging for the rocker of our baby. The recharger is good as it is for different size batteries
3,Rayovac Rechargable D Batteries,"So far, they are working well in an electronic exercise cycle. However, they do not keep their charge longer than a non-rechargable. In fact, they are lasting about 1 week less."
5,2200 mAh,"Here is the missing important info, these batteries are 2200 mAh. That will give you plenty stored power, 2200 mAh is great!"
5,yeha!,let your baby have a wild ride on this very cute pony.let them pack their fashion tools and set of on a adventure!!!yeha!!!!
1,Review for Rolling Stones Big Hits vol2,This record is one I love best.I had it in vinil (L.P.).Some of the tracks like Honky Tonky Woman and Street Fighting man are not available in the others R.S. compact dics.Besides this record has another layer for super audio c.d. which is very good.
5,Kidsongs are the Best,Kidsongs are so good and they hold the kids' attention. They love the music and the kids in the video. I have never received a bad one yet.
5,Excellent book.,"Having recently finished Harvey Sachs' book on Rubinstein(which I enjoyed), I found Dubal's book even more enjoyable and insightful. His writing is fresh and engaging, and I wasn't bothered at all by Dubal's asides and personal comments. He is a pianist who understood Horowitz both as a musician and a friend. The fact that Mrs. Horowitz welcomed Dubal into their family is an indication of the trust and respect they felt for Dubal. In his later years, Horowitz's insecurities became even more pronounced, and he did not do well with any criticism. Thus, even the people who produced the film ""The Last Romantic"" praised him constantly, even when his playing got sloppy. At least Dubal was honest with him from time to time when Horowitz's playing suffered from lack of practice. I also wish to thank Mr.Dubal for pointing out the endless sorrow that has resulted from the German invention of the footnote."
1,Avoid.,"Someday there will be a real biography of Horowitz. In the mean time I urge everyone to avoid Mr. Dubal's ego. Like the other reviewer, I couldn't make it more than half-way before becoming so disgusted I had to throw the whole thing out. As an alternative, try ""Rubinstein: A Life"" by Harvey Sachs. Not Horowitz, but engaging and worthwhile."
2,The author appeals to gossip,"Dubal here writes a series of unecessary gossips and quite a few wrong facts. His attitude towards the Horowitz family has not been friendly, his revealing agressive thoughts can cause a fake impression of the master."
3,Very Good Purchase,"This is a very good selection if you already checked to have a special place to install it in your car, do not reccomend it to have it completely exposed to rain and dust, it great to the licence plate space that some suv's have. It works grat in dayligth and good with the reverse ligth at nigth."
3,It's ok.,"Very wide view gives me a wide view of everything. It's ok, but it doesn't look anywhere near as good as the stock camera that comes with my Nissan. But for aftermarket stuff, i hear this is as good as it gets."
2,Night vision is not good.,During day light the picture quality is excellent. During the night is when the trouble comes. Way too dark for catching anything that's near the rear end of my truck unless highly illuminated by street lights or something else.
2,Disapointed,A bit disapointed. The wide angle of the lense if good to help you see someone crossing behind your car but is too wide to help you park your car. Too expensive for what it is.
3,Essential Review,Some of Pete Seeger's edgier songs I had never heard of before with a couple of exceptions. Interesting mix but not my favorite.
4,What a great book!,"It was initially difficult to get the rhythm of this book (I'm American, and some expressions and spellings created little glitches which detracted from the smoothness of the read), but after a while, I just went wild for the style and humor of the main character. I can't wait until the next Sam Jones escapade!"
5,Another Champ,"Lauren has written another winner. Sam Jones, the main character, finds herself looking for clues and answers in yet another page turning mystery. Her witty style - fashion sense and humor make her one of my heroes. A quote from the novel, ""..., saying a silent prayer of thanks, as so often, to the person who invented Lycra miniskirts."" Here is Sam's idea on kids, ""Children in any quantity give me hives."" This story revolves around her first New York show. You will be trying to figure out who done it while knowing she has already got the person pegged. A must read!"
3,Goku Model Kit,"This is a pain to put together. It's fun to play with, as with any action figure, but plan to spend some time assembling it. The pieces are too hard to snap together for little kids."
4,"By now outdated, but still has some usefull information","I read this book when it first came out in the beginning of '96 and I think it's still pretty informative today. It's a bit outdated now, but there's good practical information for people who aren't network professionals, but are computer-literate and are interested about learning more about networking, the internet, etc."
1,Feedback,"I have read this book already some time ago and I consider the language used messy and hard to catch up. If the book would have been written in more structured way, it could be pretty useful."
4,Workout Bible is a Must Have,"If you're new to strength training this book is a must have. It's loaded with good explanations and advice for the beginner. Everyone tells you to consult with your doctor before starting an exercise program; well, I'd add this book to the list of things you need before starting a strength training program. The book has good illustrations that show you how to do exercises properly, using good form, which is important in preventing injuries."
3,"This is a decent book, but a little annoying","I enjoyed this book for excerising ideas, but was pretty annoyed at the fact that this book has variations on excersizes without really discussing how each variation will affect your work out. Does it work a different muscle group? Who knows. I am glad I bought it, but I am definately on the market for another book."
2,Home Workout,"The book shows very little alternative equipment for use at home.- Buy the book for not going to the gym, but shows no alternative exercises. I desolucionado with purchase."
2,Disappointed with book,"The book had the body broken into sections such as Shoulders, Arms, Legs and had exercises under these catagories. I wanted to see what muscles in each area trained each excercise hit such as Shoulders then Front Deltoids, Rear Deltoids, Front Head, Rear Head of the Deltoids.Was Disappointed and have had the book for one month and don't really use it.I purchased from Amazon Arnold Schwartzenegger The New Encylopedia of Modern Body Building three weeks ago and I use it constantly. Each Body Part you exercise has actual photos of how to do the exercise and what muscle within the Body Part you are trying to target. I also purchased the Men's Health Home Workout Book two weeks ago but was also Disappointed. I""m sold on Arnold's book and recommend it for any level (Beg, Intermed, Advanced)for working out with weights and machines."
5,Good value,"Pretty complete discussion of the subject, with good, clear info and lots of illustrations. Even as a lifelong lifter (but not a body-builder) I found a lot of new and important info and exercises. It is well worth the small investment."
5,Worth the money.,"This book is really the Bible of workouts. After applying the exercise with my dumbbells and bench at home, I decided I did not need to pay all that money to the Gym anymore. The text is very descriptive on all exercises. Highly recommend."
2,I never received the product,And the vendor had some lame excuse about the postal service having sent many of their shipments to the wrong address. But they did not mentioned at all when the problem would be resolved. Stay away from this vendor
2,Same as every other fitness book,This book is for beginners. Nothing new under the sun. It has the same information you will find in any exercise book. I like the large font of the text I guess it makes it easy to read.
3,ummmmm....,boring book to read...... not interesting at all. I read a few chpters and then bought the lean & hard book.
2,Not what I wanted,"Do you want a book on exercises to do at home with minimal equipment- Than this book is for you!In all other respects, I was disappointed. First, the author's failed attempt at humor is just that- failed. There is lacking information on using home gyms & equipment and actually a clear prejudice against them. The author also has a very skewed idea of what equipment actually costs.I was also hoping for some more information on cardio as well as anything to do with nutrition or diet. There was absolutely no mention of the latter.There is little information on how to create a training plan- just a few sample plans at the back of the book. This book is about 400 pages, and I think only 20 are useful and informative to me (and I'm not experienced at all with fitness)At least the book was cheap, but I'm sure better guides are out there."
3,For the beginner,"Schuler has turned out a fair rudimentary book for the home gym user. It is a good ""starter"" book for kids and beginners."
5,A decent sequel...,"The character of Nick Twisp goes somewhere other than where I anticipated in ""Revolting Youth"". Instead of growing up, he declines further into a sociopathic obsessive state, and I must say that I'm enjoying his spin downward. CD Payne is a mad genius, creating this strange world where pirates drive great Airstram yachts down PCH and a fourteen year old can get away with anything by wits only. Looking forward to the next chapter!"
4,If you think Nick was crazy in the first one...,"THINK AGAIN! Nick, never seems to suprise his audience, yet he does. Let mre rephrase that: He'll do something and you sit back in your chair and say, ""I should have known. It's not suprising.""What boy like him will do for love is utterly funny. Must read!"
2,Not as good as the original,"Enjoyed the original book about 2 years ago. Did not enjoy this one as much. The action of the book is ridiculous, and the author does a poor job of refreshing your memory on the characters and actions of the first book, so it's hard to follow sometimes. For die-hard fans of the series only."
3,It does not run on carpeted floors.,"Nice looking toy car, and decent in size. But to my dissapointment, it does not run very well on the carpeted floor of my apartment. Left turn and right turn all have some problems as it goes round. Just what you would expect from a thirty dollar cheap toy."
2,No good deer books,"There are nice pictures and nice tidbits of info about deer but generally there are no good, unbiased deer books that exist. Most books are loaded with jargon about hunting and ""management"" practices. Sadly, I have yet to find a good deer book with unbiased educated information about deer. I wish the book had more pictures for each type of deer and more specific info about the animals. Many deer books just talk about deer and people, something I don`t care about. If I wanted to read a hunting magazine I`d buy one for my bathroom reading."
1,Encyclopedia???,"Very scarce information, the kind of copy paste from different web sites. The way the materials are presented, there was no scientific investment (work/research) from the author. Relative poor quality photos. Does not cover almost any data about subspecies, range etc. The term encyclopedia is by all means a commercially directed label as the whole book is pathetically poor in information and photos. I regret that I bought it."
3,Decent introduction for the non-initiated.,"Less a ""soundtrack"" and more of a sampler of classic and contemporary southern rock, with a (somewhat inept) Jessica Simpson cover tagged on to get some radio airplay. Otherwise, a pretty good start for music fans who didn't know that The South Is Gonna Do It Again. (A note: The omission of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is a reasonable one, as ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" is set in Georgia.)Recommended for the casual fan or those who are just starting to develop an interest in southern rock. Avoid otherwise, barring a desire to pay $13 for what amounts to a decent ""driving music"" mix CD."
4,Yeehaw!,"This is a really good soundtrack . Jessica's ""these boots are made for walkin"" is the best on the album it really captures the essence of the movie , sassy , fun , and truely southern ( Hello willie nelson.) I grew up in atlanta ga so i really enjoyed the movie so this is the perfect soundtrack."
2,Significant Songs Missing,"I was very disappointed in this CD, as two of the most significant songs in the movie, Mountain's ""Mississippi Queen"" and ZZ Top's ""La Grange"", were missing from the CD. When I order a soundtrack, I want EVERY piece of music that's played in the movie. The music makes the scenes come alive.I suggest reissuing this CD with the missing songs intact and sending a complimentary copy to all who've purchased it to date."
4,talentless Jessica!!!,"Not a bad soundtrack overall. Jessica Simpson attempt at ""These Boots are Made For Walkin'"" is terrible and doesn't fit in with the rest of the soundtrack. The rest of the tracks are great. But if I want to hear ""Boots..."" I'll put in Megadeth's Killing is My Business...and Business is good."
4,I took off one Star for Jessica Simpson rendition of Boots,"Overall I liked this sountrack, except for the Jessica Simpson rendition of Nancy Sinatra's Boots, she destroyed the song, sounded like some kind of rapp fusion, man it was bad, the other 14 tracks range from very good to excellent, overall it is worth buying, but if you don't want to be sick skip the Jessica Simpson track."
5,It's just beautiful!,It's the sweetest..most beautiful presentation by the newest group in the music world. It's just great!!!
1,NOT made in the USA,"THIS PRODUCT IS MADE IN CHINA!!!!! Any claim to the contrary is entirely false advertising. ""Made in China"" is clearly stamped on the side of the box. When you call Anatex a rude receptionist will tell you that it is made in ""their factory"" in China. Right. Made in China. Not the USA. And for this price!!!! Ridiculous. Their margins must be HUGE."
5,great learning toy,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY NIECE i DIDN'T BUY IT ONLINE .... IT'S NOT HEAVY TO CARRY. MY NIECE IS 2 YEARS OLD SHE LOVES IT. IT KEEPS HER BUSY. THEY HAVE IT AT THE DOCTORS OFFICE THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT FOR HER.
3,WYSIWYG,"If you know Hy-Ko products from local hardware store - these are them. Watch out for two small nails that come with lenses in package. They are under lenses or trapped under vacuum wrap of packaging and you can easily lose them when unwrapping. Good reflectance and well formed plastic. Center ferrule placed in plastic through which supplied nails is not always dead center, if that matters.Used for replacements on driveway markers for winter snow removal. And on cedar mailbox post 'in harm's way' with city snow plow. Lots more choices online than hardware store, but have to price out with S&H; for quantity you need to see if it's worth it. I got#12 of pairs. Folks run over my markers in winter?! Metal survives; plastic reflector does not. Hence, replacements need and my large 'stash' to have on hand to replace as they are destroyed."
5,Greenbriar Boys and Joan,"I love this album and have since it first came out. However, no one seems to have mentioned the inclusion of the Greenbriar Boys on Banks of the Ohio and Little Darling, Pal of Mine, with great guitar work by John Herald (who, sadly, recently died) and Ralph Rinzler, on mandolin and guitar. Those cuts have been played endlessly, both on my lp and the cd. It was Maynard Solomon who got Joan and the Boys to record together, and it was briliant. This is a great, great album by a superb artist and human being."
1,"History of Naples, not Southern Italy","I was born in southern Italy so I was interested in this book because part of its title is ""A History of Southern Italy"". But it is far more accurate to describe it as a history of Naples with a few skimpy references to areas south of Naples to Messina. Naples is the heart and soul of this book, but then what can one expect of its writer who is described on the inside jacket as ""Native Neopolitan"". His love of Naples and its history is evident throughout. There is hardly a page where there's not endless mentions of Naples. For example, between p.268 and p.273 there are 33 mentions of ""Naples"" and ""Neopolitan"". Naples is not Southern Italy and Southern Italy is not Naples. If you are looking for a book on ""A History of Southern Italy"" this is not the book."
3,Understanding Southern Italy,"This was a book to start learn more of the traditions, history, and politics which shaped the character of the Southern Italian people. Remeber that this is a history book, so at times it's not an easy read. But as it is difficult to find detailed information about Southern Italy, this provides some useful data. The focus is mainly on Naples and Sicily and only gives glimpses of other areas (Calabria, Puglia, etc.)."
3,Lucid and graceful history,"Focusing on Naples and Sicily, this evocatively named short history provides a lucid and graceful study of complicated history. There were lovely nuggets of fact, too, the relationship of the Bronte family to a town in Southern Italy and Lord Nelson's ties to both; a bit about Southern Italian literature and letters and Neapolitan song."
3,A fun and easy to read book for your child,"This is a fun book for your child.My daughter has it memorized.It is a good learn to read book,but as far helping you to teach your child about your new baby...that didnt help us here.She is always trying to wake up the baby."
3,"I prefer ""Knitting Sutra"" to this",I was mislead by the glowing reviews. I found this book lightweight and disappointing. I was hoping for something deeper and more personal. I highly recommend the 2 books by Susan G. Lydon instead.
3,Too Zen for Me,"This book was okay, but not exactly what I was expecting. I should have read more of the reviews here, but if I had it to do over again, I'd pass."
1,What was I thinking of?,"I'm giving this book to the library. Way too much New Age blah, blah, blah. A few patterns are buried in all this blather, none of which are attractive. The long-winded glossary of abbreviations,tips and techniques might be useful to someone who has never before knitted a single stitch."
2,A disappointing episode!,"Mick Jagger, Barbara Hershey, and, yes Edward James Olmos (!) play Japanese in this overlong and boring Faerie Tale Theatre presentation. Jagger dons his British accent, even though he's a Japanese emperor, and Hershey is just not convincing. Olmos is a terrific actor, but he is so wrong for the role. Why not cast a Japanese to play a Japanese? Now there's an idea, isn't there? Only Bud Cort as The Music Master saves the show with his hilarious performance. Boasting good production values and better sets than the average Faerie Tale Theatre episode, this is still the weak link in an otherwise terrific series. Watch if you must see all the episodes in the series, otherwise, avoid!"
3,"We're Disparate, Get Used To It","Ugh. Granted, this compilation has every X song you might've heard if you *weren't* already a big fan of the band. But this disc is just tiring to listen to-- two CDs worth of X at their in-yer-face-punk-rawk-est is simply draining, and not even what the band is really about.I'd recommend, then that X newbies looking to spend $23.00 buy ""Los Angeles"" and ""Under The Big Black Sun-"" both of which display more of X's subtlety and dark humor.By the way, *avoid* ""Beyond and Back"" at all costs- the sequencing is even worse than this, and the B-sides and rarities are mostly forgettable."
3,It's a rather good book.,It's a rather good book this one. Although neither my daughter or me felt the same engagement of the story and the book as you usually have from Ms Wolde's books. I can recommend this book if you're out for something diffrent. Although the illustrations are as usuall VERY effective. The pushes the story forwards and text is almost redundant.
5,"wonderful words of wisdom, a must read for all","Talks with Trees was recommended to me by a friend and I am so grateful she told me about it. I found it to be an amazing little book. Talks with Trees is funny, sweet and extremely enjoyable. I will read this book many times and recommend it to all. It is filled with wonderful messages and wisdom that will inspire you and enhance your daily life. Keep an open mind and an open heart and enjoy. Read Talks with Trees to enrich your life and the life that surrounds us each day. Thank you Leslie Cabarga for this truly incredible book! I hope there is another to follow."
4,"Unusual, interesting little book","This is an unusual, interesting little book containing transcriptions of conversations between the author and various trees, plants and vegetables.I have previously read communications from devas, but in this case the author also talks with the individual consciousnesses of the various plant beings. This is a first for me.These plants seem very wise with a knowledge not only of all that goes on in the author's life but also of all that occurs in our human world as a whole, as well as higher matters. They are aware of their higher purpose and as a rule content with their serene, immobile lives.Read the book for yourself, should you find the topic of interest."
3,Ted Breaux has financial interest in several brands of Absinthe ...,"I just wanted to mention fairly that Ted Breaux (T. A . Breaux) in the book apparently contributes to reviews and critiques of various brands of the drink .One should note that he has a major financial interest in the increasingly popular ' Lucid ' brand of Absinthe that is sold in the USA as well as a few other more expensive high end brands that he personally distills and has created ...Jade is his signature line ... beware . But in any case, glad that absinthe is finally being able to come out of the closet and be enjoyed again ..."
3,"Ouch!Does NOT include orignal version of ""Classical Gas!!!""","Wonderful compilation of one of America's finest musicians -- but it broke mah heart to find out AFTER I ordered it -- that it does NOT include the original (orchestrated) version of ""Classical Gas."""
2,Disappointing,"The sound quality of this CD was very disappointing, as was the version of Classical Gas. It was not the ""classical"" version. Buy The Phonograph Record instead."
5,waited 27 years,"Have all MW vinyl records and I have waited for 27 years for the new release of his recordings. My vinyls are worn out and I am now without a record player. My first love was mirror with his ""Saturday at the World."" Welcome Back."
3,All in all not bad - however...,"I was looking for Classical Gas on CD for some time, I thought the original would be the best... but this isn't it. I actually prefer the California Guitar Trio version on Pathways. Asside from that this is a reasonably enjoyable album but I'd as soon have bought something else and saved the money."
5,Adorable,This is a cute little first soccer ball for the kids. Can't wait to see them chase after it on Christmas morning.
1,Don't waste your money,"After just one month of use this ball is falling apart. The cover is all cracked and coming off. I was actually shocked when I realized it was indeed the same ball I had just given my son.His response was, ""but I use it nearly every day"". Still, it should last more than a month..."
4,"Good ball, but is slippery.","This ball has good rebound and looks like quality made. My only complaint is that the synthetic leather is very slick and slippery when new. Maybe once it's broken in, it will be better. Good for practice."
5,It Works,I learned how to talk to an angry person. That sometimes comes in handy. It's common sense because it works and is natural. Try it.
4,"Fantastic album, god-like live","This band is so amazing, i am truly happy that i discovered them. They are, as all the other reviews say, masters of their instruments. If you are at all interested in the wide range of places a guitar, bass and percussion set can take you, buy this album. And, if the band ever comes to your town, SEE THEM. I saw them live after having their album for a little over a week and they were so amazing; they were beautiful. These are men who know their instruments intimately. i can't say enough about their live show. but, i could only give this 4 stars becuase of the 4 songs on the album (out of 14) that contain lyrics. the lyrics are trite, silly and just dumb. The instrumentation on the songs is also at a lower level. But keep in mind, it's only on four songs! This album is definatly worth the horrid prices people are paying for cds these days. if nothing else, buy it for the Ghanian traditional piece they play on Paint Cans. definatly cool."
4,I LOVE IT,"This is a wonderful album. This is a wonderful band. Categoriacally, they slip right between jazz, funk and trance. Most of the album consists of stellar instrumentals that are far and away masterly. I love them. Please buy this album just to hear ""Tohu Bohu"". I havent heard an instrumental that took me away like that since the first time I heard ""You Enjoy Myself"". I want to give it five stars but what keeps me is the goddamn few and far between songs with lyrics. These guys cannot write a serious song with words. They can't sing. I really hope they stop singing because they can play their instruments like gods. You can't say that one of them takes the center, they jam together. I'm gonna go see a live show..."
4,Pleasing for the rap lovers,"Marshall Mathers LP is a great cd for those who are all into rap, and just enjoy a good listening. The songs are funny in some cases, but serious as well. ""The Real Slim Shady"" is very true about what he says and stands up for. The beats in this cd are catchy and awesome for every song. The storys, like in the song ""Stan"", are very interesting too. I enjoyed hearing this cd a lot. It is a must-have to just sit back and enjoy."
2,Gets tangled easily,"It's kind of annoying, I was hoping this would solve the problem of my music device pulling the ear buds out, which it does, but it gets so tangled I quit using it out of frustration."
3,Maxell P NS Neck strap,I purchased the Maxell pNs Neck strap for my zen stone mp3 player.Although my mp3 player is like the size of a quarter the neck strap didnot give it must support. the wires are the neck is so small that it feels as if will strangle you. The sound is good but it does not drown out the surround noises
2,Falls apart,"Bought this for a friend. She used it two times and one of the earbuds fell off. Can't reattach it. It is very flimsy feeling. The length is a bit long - it hangs almost to my waist. While it is the cheapest of this type of lanyard/headphone gear, it is not a good deal. It sounded good while it was all in one piece."
3,a bit too mild for me,"This is definitely a mild-tasting chocolate. Texturally, it's very glossy and hard (it really snaps when you break off a square).I personally don't think Hachez is worth the price, but I prefer wilder, rougher chocolate with a bit more bite to it."
1,Total ripoff,"I don't care how good the chocolate is, $12 shipping on a $3 candy bar is a total ripoff! Don't order from these pirates!"
3,"Not as good as ""Big Red Fire Truck""","My toddler loves all the moving parts, but this could be designed sooo much better, to not be so fragile. Dissapointed that is was labeled in ""good"" condition when the blue engine itself was missing from one page."
2,Now Menopause Support,"I ordered this Now Menopause Support because the description said in contained kava kava but when I received the bottle,kava was not listed in any of the ingredients."
3,A very difficult game,"I purchased this game for my boys. It is so difficult that I have never completed level 4 anywhere(with 3 lifes each level). The graphics is just ok compared with some of the newer games. My boy(7) felt it was little too difficult too, he never completed level 5. My 3 1/2 year old boy passed the level one only a couple times out of hundreds of trial."
3,"Very, very challenging game.","So far, I'm the only person I know that has beaten all the levels. This was acheived only with the help of the infinite lives code, an aweful lot of frustration, and a little (more than I'd like to admit) controller throwing. That said, the dumb thing is addictive. I played compulsively until I beat it. It is a neat game, but it's so hard that I'm not really sure it's all that fun. I hear the 2 player game is better, but have no second controller..."
4,funny,This game is so cool. I remember playing it on the ps1. I'm glad i bought it. I laugh all the time.
4,Frogger,"The new Frogger is a combination of easy fun and frustratingly hard. It is a bit addicting - my friends and I just HAD to get past a certain level before we turned off the console.. but it gets to the point where one would like to start to tear his/her hair out. The first level is the best (that's the classic Frogger), the second level sort of leaves me wondering where i am supposed to be hopping, the third level is impossible (i think it's just there for show), and it continues on like that -- some levels are tricky and fun, others are just not possible to complete, and others are very ambiguous about how to get to the goals. All in all, i liked the game. It has simple controls and it's fun to play by yourself or with a friend."
1,This is not like the Frogger we knew and loved,"Grand visions of my favorite arcade game from the 80's filled my head as I purchased the new Frogger. I rushed home and put it in my Playstation only to be completely frustrated. The first level is like the old Frogger I remembered, but the rest is completely different. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind change, but the least these people could have done was created a game that was playable. It is very difficult, and after a couple of frustrating days I put the game away to collect dust. It's not just me, friends have reported the same thing. Be warned, those of you who are trying to recapture your youth, it's not the same old Frogger we knew and loved."
4,Frogger:A great game,"Frogger is a great game. it is fun to play, and has a ton of different levels. And the graphics are great and the levels are creative and interesting. The first level is easy, but after that, it gets VERY hard. It is impossible to get far without codes. I personally have not even beat half the worlds with the codes. But it's a great game, but don't get the idea that it's easy to beat, because it's not."
1,Blech,"If I wasn't addicted to the original Frogger, I would say this game was actually pretty cool but I can't. I wanted to see the original for PS. This game is HARD. I hear the 2nd one is better but I haven't tried it yet. If you don't mind the new look and scene, go for it but if you are expecting the Atari version but updated, don't waste your money. There is only one board that is similar."
1,Red Hat Linux 9,"This is the sloppiest produced book that I have ever purchased. The book did not have the pages in the correct order. The book goes from page 210 to page 163! Some of the information in the book is valuable, but is hard to read. The figures which make up a great percentage of the book are too small."
5,STARE,This is a great game for the whole family. You don't need paper and pencil and playing in teams is great.
2,S L O W,"We bought this game because we thought it would be entertaining. Turns out, it was the antithesis. There is so much down-time in Stare that if you aren't the one staring at the picture, you might forget you are playing a game all together. If you are looking for a family game that's engaging and fast-paced, save yourself the disappointment and get Bananagrams instead.We tried altering the game several ways, including playing in teams, giving more time to look at the cards, asking our own questions. Nothing worked. The concept of the game is intriguing, but in practice, it doesn't play."
1,Not a very good game.,"Look at a picture on a card. Try to memorize it. Answer questions about the picture, esentially testing your memory. Points are based on how many answers you get correct.It was entertaining for the first few minutes, but it's not one of those games that you'll go back for again and again."
5,Not just to be a good mom.,"We all try to be good moms and dads so we play these kid's games that, let's be honest, bore us to death! Even Apples to Apples Kids is fun, but not great. BUT, then in comes STARE! I promise that you will like it as much as your kids too! (For example... it is called STARE Junior so I just went on line and looked to see if there is a STARE Senior for us adults!) We play with our 7 year old and our 9 year old and my friend's 13 year old and we all have a great time. Totally worth the $29."
4,Nice,"Fun, challenging, but also a quiet game....very quiet. Too quiet for the kids to stay interested in. Quiet because they sit and memorize the picture for 2 minutes. In the meantime the others get bored."
2,very slow,"Read all the good reviews on this game prior to purchase. We are a game playing family, but will not be playing this again. For six of us around the table to wait each time a player stared at a picture then answered questions about it was uninteresting, to say the least. Even after the staring, when questions are being posed, the non-staring players are totally excluded from the process -- can't even see the pictures as the cards are not large enough to be seen over the table and much of the detail is VERY SMALL. May be okay if two very sedate people play together, but my group was unanimous...put it back in the box!"
2,Too hard for family game time,"I really thought my 13 year old daughter would like this game, but the pictures are a bit outdated and the things they want you to recall are a bit hard for that age group. The premise is good, and perhaps, if just adults were playing it could be fun."
1,The photo is misleading,"If a person is going to show a photo when selling a product I believe they should show the ONLY product they are selling, This WARN 32721 Manual Hub Spindle Nut Kit, Shows the Hubs in the photo.The Hubs do not come in the kit VARY MISLEADING In my Opinion."
5,Some Classics in Here!,"The Lazy Day lasagna will be your friend, I promise! There are a couple of bake-off winners in here. Fudgy Bon-Bons for one (which are too wonderful to describe,"
4,Good choice!,Great cookbook! This book has a lot of different receipes to choose from. I saw this book from a co-worker and wanted a copy. Glad I purchased it.
5,Best Cookbook Ever!,"I love this cookbook, from the way it tells you how to boil an egg or grill a steak to the way it makes complicated recipes easy. I made the best chocolate cheesecake ever from this cookbook. I also love the vegetarian section and I'm not a vegetarian!"
5,Made One of My Top Ten Cookbooks to Have,"Here is another candidate for your cookbook collection. Besides the fact that it is loaded with many recipes, the nutrition and dietary information is invaluable. Whether it is the older reader who needs to monitor cholesterol or watch their sodium intake to the younger person who is looking for a healtheir diet, it doesn't matter because either individual will appreciate what they will learn.Tips and cook notes abound to help answer many of your questions. Besides basic techniques, the reader will also find articles on how much to buy and what to look for when you purchase a certain food. This is a standard cookbook that every kitchen should have."
3,Not Bad.,"It's a good book, but you have to know a little about HTML to start with. It also doesn't teach you, it shows you cool effect you can do. If you want to learn HTML, then you should get HTML for Dummies, then read this. I have to tell you the software wasn't half bad."
2,"Should be called Javascript for Dummies, not DHTML","This book is not a bad book, however it will teach you little DHTML. THe author spends 2 much time on Javascript, and lacks explanation. Furthermore, the author does not ""teach"" you how to do it, but simly shows some cool DHTML effects with their codes. THis can be useful if you want to cut-n-paste the code, however if you want to learn DHTML then buy another book."
2,Too much humor and too little substance....,"I normally look to the For Dummies books as intro's to a subject (book you can read to get the basics of a new topic, and then move on to a more serious book if you need to.) And one aspect I've always liked about these books is the humor the author's use in the material to make them more entertaining.However, this author uses way too much humor or effort trying to be ""cute"". Even the Chapter titles are attempts to be humorous and or witty. To the point you can't look anything up in the table of contents because the titles don't tell you what's in the chapters!!!And although ""For Dummies"" books are usually not great reference books, at least they have most of the basics and could be used as a light reference. This book is totally worthless as a reference.Other than as an example of what the author thinks are ""cool"" effects, it was a huge disappointment for me."
2,try another product.,"very disappointed, size is very small, hardly fit anything and when you try to put something it looks too bulky. waist of money."
3,a little disappointing,"This is a very brief introduction to dog training. What you learn is useful, but I expected the trainer to go into more depth. The title suggested that the video dealt with more serious issues, not just learning to sit and lie down. The word ""extravaganza"" in the title is totally misleading, a complete exaggeration."
5,Coolest dog Training DVD Ever,"This DVD is really in a league of it's own. I never thought I could simultaneously teach my dog new tricks and be so entertained! The step-by-step instruction is easy to follow and the skits kept me laughing. The positive methods demonstrated kept the training fun and rewarding for both me and my dog. Being a music snob, I give the background music a thumbs up also. Great buy!"
4,a cool way to train your best friend,I used this video to assist me in training my very active and headstrong english lab. I enjoyed the music and setting as opposed to traditional videos. The instructions were easy to understand and transfer to practical use. It was a great introduction into basic training for new dog owners.
5,This is the book for would be game developers.,"I have many books on the subject, but this one takes the cake. Of all my books this one explains the fundamental math algorithms in ENGLISH and allows you to intuitively understand things both from a purelely mathematical standpoint as well as from a geometric standpoint. I consulted this book after having problems understanding linear combinations and basis, and how it applies to computing the plane equation. I also learnt how to geometrically interpret the dot product. This book is inexpensive considering the subject, and a welcome addition to any personal library if your learning these things. I'm building a 3D engine for MAC/PC that require a solid understanding of linear algebra and this is basically what this book has to offer."
4,"Not bad, but not the best","Though the book covers a broad range of mathematics present in the field of computer graphics, I found it lacking in certain respects. The plentiful diagrams and figures greatly assisted comprehension of stated materials, yet I would like to see written proofs of methods used. In addition, such topics as quaternions are only briefly mentioned in historical references. Although this is an excellant mathematics book, I strongly recommend the purchase of Mathematics for 3D Game Programming & Computer Graphics in addition to this title."
2,Not quite inspiring,"This recording has been around for years. While I generally respect Jerry Bilik as an arranger, his style falls flat when applied to fight songs. You wind up with altered rhythms, strange combinations of instruments (such as sousaphones and piccolos) carrying the lead and so forth. It sounds like a concert band trying to take artistic license with fight songs, and it just doesn't work. As a former college marching band member, I find this recording leaving me uninspired. The musicianship is exemplary, but the end product isn't what I expected."
1,What the?!,"As a member of a Big Ten marching band, I have had the good fortune to watch most of these groups perform live on the field on Saturday afternoons. These recordings would sound more at place on the soundtrack to the Nutcracker. There is great musicianship as would be expected from a Big Ten band, but these are not the legendary fight songs that I thought I was purchasing. Does anyone know of a compiliation of the Saturday versions of these great songs?"
1,Terrible arrangements,UM is certainly one of the finest marching bands in the nation; but these arangements are just awful. The rendition for On Brave Old Army Team sounds like something conjured up for the soundtrack of a bad war movie. This would be a great CD if they just played them straight.
2,"What did I expect, anyway?","Although the concert band in Ann Arbor puts in a yoeman-like performance, the arrangements are just awful. UM's band always seems to fumble the ball when it comes to arranging the fight songs of other teams in the Big T(elev)en, and that tendency shows through on this album. At least the concert band doesn't ""jump-march"" during their performance, so there isn't that annoying drop in tone, tenor and constancy every two beats, like there is at live performances.With any luck, maybe Ohio State - the nation's best band - will put out a comparable CD. Once they play even an opposing team's fight song, they own it."
5,knowing,this is the beginning of a trilogy of books about anglo and his experiences. travel to new mexico to the home of the hopi and other tribes and learn the ways of a shaman.
1,IF YOU'RE FOND OF JUNKY AND TACKY...,"...then this book is for you! I was surprised by the positive reviews. Ms. King is resourceful in finding materials to use, but the results most often resemble something produced by an inept child. The many items made from cheap cardboard and foil look - yes! - as if they are made from cheap cardboard and foil. I am all for innovation if the end result is attractive, but these items are not. I would furnish my dollhouse with this stuff only if it was to be viewed from several yards away."
5,A must for all fans of 60's improvisational rock-and-roll,"This is one of the farewell performances of Country Joe and the Fish (and coincidentally is the same show that featured the American debut of Led Zeppelin), and as a result go out with a real bang!. The highlight of this album is undoubtedly the 38 min ""Donovan's Reef Jam"" featuring special guests Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, and Steve Miller. Though this is enough for any Deadhead, the rest of the album is superb. My personal favorites include the opening ""Rock and Soul Music"" jam and the sweet ""It's So Nice To Have Your Love"". Having not heard much Country Joe music (with the exception of the Woodstock soundtrack), this album has made me an instant fan of the group. Certainly a must for any fan of San Francisco era improvisational music."
5,We want more!,"This was a great band, individually and collectively. It's a shame that the relationships have not been maintained over the years. Ce la vie! The really great thing about this album is the jamming aspect. Always known for the lyrical and political aspects of their music, the Fish could jam it up like the best of them. Indeed Barry Melton in his new life still does. But what performances have we on this jewel of a disc. I suspect that many of the people who bought this album did so because of the appearance of Dead members Garcia and Hart or even Casady and Kaukkonen and good luck to them because they will have been exposed to some killer playing on the disc. Barry Melton is on top form throughout and plays his heart out. My only regret is that there is not more of these shows or other live Fish performances around. If anyone out there is listening...WE WANT MORE! A highly recommended alum which should grace the shelves of any afficionado of West Coast Music."
3,What Happen'd???,"I did not like this cd this much.It had some songs that why playd out!! The thing is, how come on every source hip hop cd they always put Benzino? To tell you the true he sucks!!! The only good song's on this cd areLil Flip:Game OverHouston feat. Chingy,Nate Dogg,I-20:I Like ThatLil Scrappy:No ProblemThose are are the only songs i like out of this cd!!Like I said before ""NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC"" THE SIRES IS BETTER!!! Shout out to all my LATINOS!!!"
3,"5"" driver","I replaced the mids and woofers in my old kenwood speakers with Pyles, the mids are ok, they are shrill so an eq is a must, one of the woofers lasted about 30 min, amazon replaced it w no hassles, I`m kinda careful about how hard i push them now, the power handling ratings are over- inflated, it`s cheapo chinese stuff but the price is right if you dont push them too much. I wish they would carry some better brands, I used nippon tweeters rated at 50 watts, they are japanese and much better quality. Pyle is part of Pyramid if that tells you anything."
5,Great mid for my system,i needed highly efficient mids as replacements and these worked perfectly and sound great. These have been in use for a couple of months and I would recomend.
5,SUPERB!!!,Read this book if you ever wanted to know anything about evolution! It is full of interesting and incredibly insightful information on the subject!!
2,An amalgamation of confusing smorgasbord,"I have enjoyed Elwood's past novels (Angelwalk, Darien) but I found ""Without the Dawn"" to be very confusing. For example, the book is primarily supposed to be about the discovery of a plot to destroy the world with a secret biological weapon. Yet throughout, there is an element of unreality that makes the story and characters seem almost surreal. Although the story takes place in modern times, the characters and their surrounding make you think you are reading a book about medival England. Simultaneouly, the author addresses the evils of the INTERNET but this, too, does not seem to pertain to the main plot. In the end, the book deals more with ""whales"" than anything else. I just don't believe this book was written as well as what I have come to expect from Roger Elwood, an author I deeply admire and respect."
4,Works as expected,"I've had problems with OEM batteries in the past (particularly for my wife's K-series Sony laptop), so I was very cautious about buying a battery that's not made by Sony or a brand I recognized (like Energizer or Duracell). However I couldn't find a compatible battery made by any of these guys that was reasonably priced, so I bought this one.I received this battery and have been working with it a few days. So far I have been pleased. The battery fits the slot on my Sony Z1RAP2 laptop smoothly, and it charged up as expected. The Sony PowerPanel application can read the charge level of the battery and at a full charge it estimates a run time of almost 3 hours (2:59).The brand of the battery shipped to me was a HI-Capacity, part number B-5469"
4,A great classic - updated and even better!,"you remember how much fun it was to play Monopoly when you were a kid? It's just as fun now- but better! You can stop the game at any time and save it to your memory card. That way you are able to come back and continue playing again later. The graphics are pretty good, But the music is a little annoying. All and all a fabulous update on a classic."
4,Monopoly Madness!,"A nicely done adaption for the Playstation. Although I do not agree with the auctioning of properties, all of the fun is still intact from the board game. A must for Monopoly lovers who want to play it even more!"
1,No A.I. to be found,"Well, the good points...The game manages to include most of the Monopoly rules correctly, and allows some of the common home variants to be used as well. It may just be up to par for play against human opponents on a PSone with travel screen for rainy holidays.But... the computer A.I. is atrocious. I am sure no one actually game-tested this product to see if it could play the game with any skill. Most seven year olds will beat this at the hardest level without difficulty. The A.I. contains no concept of the value of property, or property sets..."
3,Game gets boring.,I loved the idea of being able to play it without all the set up and mess......but after playing it a few times it can get rather boring. If i would have rented this game first i probally would not have purchased it. I have not tryed playing it with more that 2 people... i could see where this would make it more fun.
4,Great to play this game with others,"This is a great game to play with a friend or two or more. It's still fun to play it by yourself but it's definately better as a multiplayer game. This game is pretty addicting, so if you have alot of time to kill this is the perfect game for you. Hopefully there will be an upgraded version for this on the Playstation 3 but I highly recommend this game."
2,Only buy if you've got a lot of friends to play it with,"If you have other real people to play this game with, this is a fun way to play Monopoly because all of the time you normally waste digging for pieces or cards and counting money is done away with.However, playing the computer is no fun what so ever because it has been programmed to be such an abysmal player. It offers you cash for properties based only on their mortgage value. Thus it will buy a property for two hundred dollars one turn, and sell it to you the very next turn for $100- and this is only one example of how much of a dunce it is as an oponent. So if you were hoping that you could finally spend your nights playing Monopoly without having to invite a bunch of people over, I am sorry to say you will be sorely disapointed."
1,A waste of time and money!,"This video was very poorly produced. While, the trumpet instructor seems like an ok performer, I doubt he has much teaching experience. As for the music theory teacher on the tape, forget it! His instructions were so convoluted and they made no sense whatsoever unless you already knew everything!I didn't learn anything from this video that I didn't already learn from reading some information on the web. Don't waste your money on this. Try to find another video or invest in a real lesson instead. Believe me you'll learn much more."

5,The best war novel to come down the pike in recent memory.,"Dennis Foley has created a wonderful character, Jim Hollister. If you have never read a novel about the Vietnam War, make this exciting series your first. You might as well read them in order (Long Range Patrol, Night Work, and Take Back the Night), if you don't order all three together you'll soon be ordering the rest. The novels are so well written you can see, feel, hear and live the action. The characters are real and believable. Treat yourself today, you won't regret it!"
5,Ray J Sonnier,"As usual I read this book before I read Dennis's first book. I still enjoyed the book very much. Dennis puts you in there with Hollister. I as a member of a LRRP/RANGER unit(Echo 50thLRRP /Echo 75th RANGER unit would have loved to have had someone like him leading our unit. Dennis made this book sing. I lost a lots of sleep,because I couldn't put the book down. I also have his other book, I will go back, and read them both again."
4,Black Iris,I have just discovered Dr. Jeane Harris' books and poetry. She is so insightful and exciting to read. The Black Iris is full of suspense and the characters will stay with me - they are real and the dialogue is riveting.
5,'n Moet! Stimulerende boek wat lees soos 'n roman,Nog nooit het ek geskiedenis so pakkend ervaar nie. Die boek lees soos 'n roman wat jy net nie kan neersit nie. En dit laat allerhande vrae -- dit bly jou by. Lees dit!
4,Pink Vest and Ties,Arrived just as advertised. Color is an exact match to the photos. Quality was good. Good value and matched the Bridesmaids' dresses perfectly.
2,Lisa Ilgen,The quality of this vest isn't real great. The vest was supposed to be adjustable and the adjustable slide didn't hold. The vest also snagged after wearing 1 time. The seller was very kind/professional in refunding my purchase price. Good seller.
3,It was a good buy.,I bought this skull to add to my collection. It was a great buy for a good price.
5,COLLECTORS/DEALERS MUST HAVE,"AS A COLLECTOR AND SON OF A COLLECTOR I CAN SAY WITHOUT THIS BOOK YOU WILL BE LOST. THE SECTION ON THE MARKS COULD STAND ALONE. FOR US COLLECTORS THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN SEEING WHAT ITEM COME ""OUT OF THE CLOSET"" AND INTO THE MARKET!COMPLAINT, THE SECTION ON SILVER CUPS IS TO SMALL."
2,Poser Rock For the Most Part,"Being a fan of The Stooges, The White Stripes, MC5, and most other things Detroit, I bought this. I listened with increasing levels of dissapointment as each song seemed to propel the album further into the insipid zone of easy hooks and infantile lyrics.Grouping these guys with the company listed above would be like grouping Oasis with The Rolling Stones and The Who."
1,don't waste your money,The hype for this band is shameless ... they latch on to the fact that this was Jack White's band. They kicked him out ... I guess we all know who is laughing all the way to the bank.DON' BOTHER WITH BUYING THIS CD.
2,Velcro doesnt last long!,"I like the look of the case, I wear it at the office and it doesnt look out of place when i wear it next to my cell phone. However, the velcro sucks! It lasted me a week or two, and then the loop side becomes a mess and the hooks no longer grab. Luckily my fiancee can sew, im going to have her replace the loop side. A clip/ snap button/ or magnet would have been a better option."
4,Good accessory for your Skeletool!,I bought this Sheath for my new skeletool CX. It fit perfect and provide good protection to the Sk Tool. Also is a convenient way to carry your Sk tool.
3,Not for normal belt use,"OK, my fault for not checking up on this more carefully, but this is not for normal belt use. 'MOLLE' is a type of attachment system for use with military type equipment.If you want a sheath for normal belt use for the Skeletool you bought on Amazon, you are out of luck. You will need to look elsewhere for the Leatherman leather sheath 909000 or nylon sheath 944401, neither of which are available here.I am rating this 3 stars because I can not ding it or praise it as I can not use it. It is not worth returning, return shipping would be almost what I paid for it."
3,Good,Nice to have Molle compatible straps.Good size for most folding knifes or multitools.Wish there were extra pocket on either side or on front.
3,Probably last forever,"It's okay, built great though not exactly what I was hoping it would be. My mistake. It holds my Skeletool CX or my leatherman bit accessories but not both. Also not the belt or clip option you might expect, only Molle connecting which you can fudge for your belt. It was cheap enough to give it a try."
2,"Well, it is cheap.","The front flap is made of good material, but the pocket that holds the tool is cheap.Also the MOLLE attachment is too narrow for most leather belts, unlike the TAD S1 pouch(IMO, the best tool pouch made)It barely fit my tool, even though it's described to be 4.5"" deep.IMO, It's really not worth the bother. Because if you are looking for hard use on your MOLLE vest, etc, you might as forget it.For paying 25% more you can actually get something that you will love and that also just works right :( Disappointed."
5,Excellent,Perfect fit. Have two LeatherMan. The Blast and Surge.I JUST LOVE IT !!!! I JUST LOVE IT !!!! I JUST LOVE IT !!!! I JUST LOVE IT !!!!
2,Not good to replace the old leather pouch,"I purchased this as a replacement for my Leather pouch from an older Super Leatherman. I love my old heave duty leather pouch, The tool fits sloppy lose in this pouch, I dont like the velcro. It is well made. It just does not function like my Leather pouch. If your looking for something for the older Super Leatherman I would look around a little more."
1,Not Easy To Use,"I just wanted a pouch to hold my leatherman skeletool. I got this one online. It looks good but it is not designed to fit on a belt, which is what I want it for. So I have to say , that it is next to useless. The description provided does not inform buyers that this is not suitable for belt use. Waste of money."
2,Very uninteresting compilation,"Compilations such as this actually do a disservice to any of the artists who appear here. I can well imagine that the compiler of this set is none other than Richard Zimmerman, who gave himself at least three cuts on the album, 2 of which can be downloaded, which places him in a tie with EUBIE BLAKE!!!!!!!!!! The whole album is pretty much a plethora of unrelated styles. The piano disc has boring Rifkin, the crazed, out-of-control piano-roll style of Zimmerman, the barrel-echoing pianos of Arpin & Wilson, the non-ragtime performances of Roberts and Blais etc.Thank the Lord for the others -as the disk would be a total failure. I'm not into bands so I'll refrain from making comments about disc 2."
2,Price is great but has kind of a dead sound.,Not much ring to this block...kind of a dead/muffledsound and not very clear. I would recommend spending more toget a nicer block. The sound difference is worth it!
5,Excellent for women,"This came exactly how it was sopose to be. No complaints, except the price just went down on it. I paid 60 for it and now its 40. So if you want one, I guess this is the time to get it. Good Buy overall. I LOVE MY FALCONS!"
4,Nobody will play with me :-*(,"I did great and kicked everyone's butt, and felt bad that I knew all the answers/figured them out and that they were bored. I'm good and descrambling where they aren't. My husband got a couple only when I was reading the questions. So needless to say I won't be playing this anymore since nobody will play with me."
5,nice introduction to extropy,it was a nice transhumanist book. it made me more interested in extropy.
5,WILD!,"Read about the guy who decapitated his mother! Read about Evel Knievel, who broke most every bone in his body(?)! Read about Great Mambo Chicken! Read all about it! Wild!"
2,does not live up to its title,"This book is inadvertantly funny. I laughed when I shouldn't, and didn't when I was supposed to. Worth reading so as to fully just understand how crazy those crazy people are that talk about ""Transhumanism"" and ""The Omega Point.""Freaks.it is worth reading for the chapters on cryonics.this book would have been better had it either focused on serious transhumanist projects, or had been a straight up mocking of the odd balls it covers. either way it would have been better than what it is, which was a collection of character studies pretending to be science journalism."
1,Not science at all.,"I bought this book after reading all the reviews found in Amazon plus having read previous book of Ed Regis (Who Got Einstein's Office?, which was excellent!) and I have to say that I was unhappy with it.Firstable, what Ed explains are cases of people involve in projects: to be an astronaut, to freeze people, to conquer other planets,... 'can we say that is science?, I would say no. They are only crazy ideas of getting there and the way to carry out them, but nothing else. No money no project.Second, projects are not really serious. Is it serious to become the first private person to go to the moon an ommelette seller? Is it serious to cut one's head (to keep only that part of the body in the freezer) because you have run out of funds?Perhaps I was looking for anything else when I bought this book but now I found that Ed Regis is my author only when he talks about serious science."
4,A fascinating story of science and the people behind it.,"Mr. Regis does an excellent job of presenting the ideas behind science that's pushing the envelope of what we know and can do. He also presents fascinating stories of many of the people behind these speculative ideas, who have many common connections.I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious about the general ideas behind such topics as nanotechnology, cryonics, artificial life, etc. I enjoyed it"
3,Formula. But Good,"If you are a fan of James Patterson, you have no need to read any futher about this book.On a previous entry after I read 4th of July I said that it was an enjoyable book, but very formulaic. I also said that I probably would not read another Patterson book. I was wrong, but I did prove to myself that my assumption was correct about the mass of books written by James Patterson. This time, I will not say that I probably will not get another one, but I at least know that I should not expect anything very thought provoking when I do. The books are not bad, but popcorn is not bad either.If you have not read Patterson before, then I will tell you that this is an action filled book with lots of bad guys, mysterious contract killers, mafia dons, hidden bombs in public places and international chases to the ends of the Earth.A good airplane book if you plan on taking a trip soon."
1,Behold...le minimal chapter,"Oh. My first Patterson. My last Patterson. This review is an example of the average chapter verbage, minimal. Ever wondered what it's like to read a screenplay...this is your chance, obviously written for another poor television series doomed to fail. When did Amazon start allowing authors to stump their television forays, unfortunate. For those of you seeking detective intrigue, please spend your money on Michael Connelly, his heart goes into his novels."
2,Better to write on your own,"Sorry Mr. Patterson, but the quality of your work went south in this book. Come on now, we all are aware that when you are hot, you're hot without having to read how many times the main characters 'made out'. I read your books for the psychological murder mystery. I have always enjoyed your work when you work alone (i.e. the Alex Cross series). There is an exception with the women's murder series - they were good. Please consider going back to a solo act and you don't have to crank out so many books. All your earlier books were outstanding, but now the quality is dropping off. My apolgies for my blunt review, but I needed you to read this. Thank you for listening. K."
3,Where is Alex Cross when you need him?,"I use to think that I was a big fan of Patterson - until I started reading his ""out of series"" book.I just plowed my way through Judge and Jury and this has finally confirmed it all for me. I am a big fan of Alex Cross - the rest of the books by Patterson are boring and pointless for me.Judge and Jury felt like such a chore to read. I miss the compassion of Alex Cross - I kept looking for the meaning in Judge and Jury and could not find it.Boring. No more out of series books for me."
1,So bad it's almost funny,"This is one of those books that you just know was cranked out in a couple weeks. The dialogue is ridiculous, the storyline is trite and the characters are flat. The good cop is chasing down bad guys who say ""I kill just for fun! Muah-ha-ha!"" The good guy thinks ""I won't sleep until I catch those bad guys!"" and teams up with a distraught, but determined, woman who says, ""I am weak in your arms, but still strong at heart! I must have revenge!""The verdict is in - this book is not worth reading."
2,Didn't like the audio book...,however I'm not sure if it was the reader or the actual story. But I was really bored with this story...definitely wouldn't recommend.
1,buy it at a garage sale,"James patterson aka whoever he is writing with at the moment has totally lost it... shallow plot, no in depth characters, really not much of a story. i didnt want to buy it but my neighbor insisted. it was her first patterson novel.. anyway, he is laughing all the way to the bank.. bad book. i didnt even finish the first 100 pages, thank goodness Target takes back books or i would be out 20.00. thank you . lisa baker."
4,Rivoting,"I am a teacher and have to read professional text all the time. This book was a wonderful escape into lives with feelings, pasion, and needs. I enjoyed the drama, the twists, the predictability of some of the chapters and the ending!!!! I did read the ending twice to be sure and to feel good. I have shared this book with everyone!!!. Thanks. Sandra Helliwell"
4,Another good one!,"James Patterson does it again! This book is fast-paced, suspenseful, almost romantic with a twist of the Sopranos. I'm not usually a James Patterson fan but this will definitely keep me reading!"
4,Another good read!,"As per the norm for Patterson, this book read well! Keeps you in suspense, and w/ Joe Magtanya's Brooklyn accent, adds the ""mafia"" kick!! Well Done!!"
3,Not bad,This book was okay. Got it at the library. It was a quick read. My favorite was the ending. My favorite JP books are the Cross series. I look forward to reading the next one.
3,Enjoyable,"Recently, I asked my daughter why she liked James Patterson's books. She replied that they held her attention and were easy to read. Although ""Judge & Jury"" is not one of his best, I found it enjoyable for those very reasons.This book had a plot and was faithful to it. Although it was relatively small, it held my attention and I enjoyed the characters. It is the type of book I would take on a plane or to the beach."
3,James Patterson Does It Again,"If you are a James Patterson fan, you will enjoy this book. Like all of his books, it reads very quickly (I think I read it in two days). I had some difficulty believing the relationships and found them to be a little too cliche. I also found some of the events a little too conincidental. However, it was a good read (hey, it kept my interest), so it's worth a try."
4,Gripping book that holds the reader's attention,"This book has it all - murder, mayhem, romance, and a thick plotline that kept me engaged all the way through. Patterson's characters are well-developed and their motives believable. He's created a couple of villains that had me cheering once they met their ultimate demise.There are enough loose ends here to warrant a sequel. There had to be some repercussions from Nick and Andie's actions, and I think those could be the foundation for another visit to these characters.Patterson's writing style is spare and he doesn't waste a lot of words. I appreciate that quality and always find his books to be a quick, yet worthwhile read. 'Judge and Jury' is no exception."
2,Another mass-produced book with no heart,"Another book by Patterson (and his favorite co-author) that reads just like every other book Patterson has written. Lots of short sentences, short chapters, and a plethora of italics. I think Patterson must believe that adding italics to any sentence makes it suspense-filled or more interesting somehow. I did enjoy early Patterson, but he has become the Ford of the publishing world. For those who are still hooked -- it's a good beach read, but there's just no substance to it.As for me, I'm done reading his books, but it makes me sad that an author I once loved to read has become such an assembly line writer. (Add italics here, some exclamation points there, a thin plot, a love interest, and voila! you're done.)"
4,This was one of the best recent reads I had,"I read this entire book in one day on a flight out instead of working. That is the type of book I want to read. Easy flowing, fast topics with chapters that keep you wanting to read just one more.This did just that. From the build up of the arrest to the tracking. He made it sound too easy while playing a nice overtone of danger in each of the 4 sections. The mafia boss was not overdone and fit in too well. One of Pattersons better readds to date for me."
4,A page-turning mystery read,"If you've read other Patterson mysteries and enjoyed them, you'll like this one, too. There are no real surprises--this novel trods the well-worn mystery formula, but does so entertainingly. Yes, there are legal bloopers, but people don't read novels like this to learn the law. If you haven't read any Patterson, you'll probably like this if you like John Grisham, for instance. These are plot-driven novels with not too much description or fine character development. If you like Law & Order, you'll probably like this, too."
4,Judged to be a great book.,"As judge & jury, I would highly recommend this book. Patterson can't write a bad book, but this is one of his best."
2,"Formulaic, predictable and ridiculous","This is a pretty bad thriller, it is formulaic, predictable and ridiculous. The characters are one dimensional and totally unoriginal. Although there were a few entertaining sequences, the book is not worth buying as there are far far better examples of the genre out there."
5,A Long Time Coming,"James Patterson has rolled out some stinkers the past few years, largely because of his passing to 'co-authors' and the work has suffered. A lontime fan of Mr. Patterson's work before the turn of the century, I was exetremly pleased with the character Dominic Cavello and his hunters. The book was fast, light, and fun - perfect for beach reading. The only drawback: why the bump to $27.99? I feel like the word count is so low and the price to high, not to mention the fact that he writes five a year now, that you actually have to read the reviews before shelling out $30. Anyway, the book went by in about three hours and I was exhilerated. I couldn't dare recommend it, but I would never discourage someone from picking it up. One can only hope this fall's 'Cross' is as amazing as the jacket tells us."
4,Loved the ending,"I read all of Patterson's books--even those he co-writes which perhaps means he's not the writer. But I enjoy most of them for what they are--fun to read. And in this one, I loved the ending. It made me smile. And to me, that helps to make it a good book and a fun story.I read for pure enjoyment and this pretty much fit the bill."
3,Not His Best.,"With a co-writer on board, you would think that Patterson would turn out a thriller that would leave you wanting more right from the beginning. Instead, we get every dark Italian stereotype in the book, complete with the very disturbing issue of a guy so monstrous he would scald a one year-old baby with hot tea kettle water? Other than that, the story is slow until the latter half when he escapes and the action really starts. Not a bad read, but I have to take off two stars for the slowness up front and the Godfather-from-hell formula that's been overly done too many times before."
2,Neither an interesting courtroom drama nor an action packet mystery thriller,"*** This review contains spoilers ***With Patterson it's either hit or miss. This one is a miss.The story revolves around an FBI agent, a juror, a mafia don on trial and a whole lot of bad writing. I tried to get into the story, but it was neither an interesting courtroom drama (like Grisham's) nor an action packet mystery thriller like some of Harlan Coben's stories.While the FBI agent is desperately trying to see a convicted don, he indirectly becomes the reason for the death of juror number 9's young son. Time moves forward and as expected, the FBI agent falls in love with the juror, the mobster escapes bail and we are left with a grueling read (chapter 40 through 110) to find out where he's hiding and how the agent and the mother will get their vengeance.Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Instead, read some of Grisham's books...ANY of Ghrisham's books."
3,joecool,"Started this book with great anticipation, but soon became bored and put it down and picked up ""The Hard Way"" by Lee Child...a much better written book and more interesting to read. Not sure if I will ever finish Judge and Jury."
1,Absolutely awful,"Five stars?? Did we read the same book? This book reads like a C grade effort by a high-schooler. Where was the editor? The plot is ludicrous, the characterizations comically shallow and predictable. This book is an insult to the reader's intelligence."
3,Not a bad album but nothing special,Revoltons - Night Visions is not a terrible album but it's nothing that stands out. This is a album that's worth checking out but if you don't you won't be missing anything.
4,Fun..if a little dull,"Age of Empires III is an enjoyable hybrid between a classic city building game and a historical strategy game of the Civilization genre. As such, it can be a little slow once you've mastered the basics. The graphic quality is very good, and the scenario story is engaging. However, once I completed a full campaign, I didn't find myself wanted to play it through again."
1,Boring game,This is a very boring game. It is not as rich in terms of historical value as its predecessors. I am extremely disappointed for buying this game.
1,Totally Dissappointed!!!!,"Well, there's not much to say except I played this game about 20 times and hoped somehow it would get better, it didn't!!!! The graghics are fine but the overall game sucks! I played Age of Empires 2 all the time and would much rather play that.Overall, I can't believe I waited all this time for Age of Empires 3 to come out just to be dissapointed!!"
3,"Entertaining, but could have been better","This game continues the AoE tradition with entertaining gameplay, but falls a bit short of my expectations for a new game.What I liked:-The new units require more strategy to use than in previous games. You have to have the right unit for the job.-""Explorer"" characters are a nice plus.-I liked the pioneering peasants that can actually shoot, trade routes and trappers that bring you extra resourcesWhat I did not like:-The story was a bit cheesy, and flew through 150 years of history and endless geographical locations-The graphics left a lot to be desired-The lower-ranking characters still speak globbety-gook to you. ""Hull-sahr"" ""Ahdilluous lookay!"""
4,Good,"Good game to take your mind off of the stressors or school, well at least for me. The campaign is nice and it makes me laugh, its relatively short if you shoot through it all in one setting but all that can change with just a change in difficulty. The graphics are or but using a higher processing computer makes the experience a whole lot funner. I have a macbook 13' with an i5 processor and its fairly decent in terms of graphics but I downloaded the game onto one of my universities mac desktops and it looks beautiful and runs smoothly with no lag or nothing."
4,Verry good game!,"This game it is a legend... The best! Only have one problem, is not possible change the language. Verry advisable!"
5,Amazing strategy game!,"Age of Empires is the best strategy/war game ever!But you gonna need time to play.. coz takes some hours to play..! you know, until you make an army and kill you oponent..but is very fun! and try the multiplayer game, and we will see if you have the best strategy.....hope helped you."
1,Incompatible,"This game will not work with the Lion OS on my new iMac despite Amazon's statement that it is a ""Mac version."" There should be some warning that makes this clear. A net search shows that I am not alone in this problem."
2,Maybe it's me...,"...but I was a big fan of the first AOE. I play on a Mac, and one disappointing aspect of version 3 for me is that they made it so you have to right click for certain commands and left click for others. Since a Mac really only has one mouse button, in my experience it ""misses"" commands often if you don't click the one button correctly. Version 1 had a ""command + click"" control and in my opinion it was a lot easier. Sounds stupid, but when you're in the middle of getting attacked after playing the game for an hour, it really gets frustrating when you can't even give commands properly. Cool game, and great graphics, but they should have built in an option for ""Classic Controls"" or something. Quit trying to make my Mac a PC!"
3,"Pricey, convoluted story","I won't cover the same ground given by other reviewers: it's a great game, and follows on nicely from AOE2 and AOM.My problem is that there's only one story arc included in the game, and it's kinda convoluted in a ""renaissance fair"" sort of way. It would have been better to have three or four shorter campaigns which referred to actual history than just that one rather lame alternate history campaign.Of course, they want you to buy the other stories for $30 a pop, which currently brings the total to a whopping $90. Just for a game! That'll buy me a pair of tyres for my car and I'll get more mileage out of them! Or heck, just get the full Windows version with Asian Dynasties and Warlords expansions for $35 and use Bootcamp! (You... do have a legit copy of XP lying around and 15GB of spare drive space, don't you?)"
2,BE CAREFUL OF THIS ONE,"I am fearful that the historical accuracy of some of the statements made by this author are in question. I found the work to be rather poorly footnoted and some of the author's conclusions quite questionable. I also found that the work was quite repetative and that much of what the author had to tell us could have been presented in about one fourth of the pages actually used. After reading the book, I certainly would not try passing myself off as an expert on ""secret societies"" and their impact on our present time. Do some home work on your own before reading this one, and as I said, becareful of this one!"
2,Where are the primary sources???,"I picked up this book thinking it would give at least a decent historical overview of secret societies in America and was fairly satisfied with it until I looked at the bibliography about halfway through and saw that Sora did not include a single primary source. Even I wasn't lazy enough to use no primary sources when I was writing halfassed research papers in college so I found it pretty much inexcusable that a published author did so. If he actually went to source material and found these facts I would recommend it, but I don't just want to see a rehashing of probably already dilluted conspiracy theory tripe. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Let down,"The author starts off telling us that Skull and Bones membership essentially guarantees a world of privilige, power and wealth. By the end we find out it is not much more than a club whose members do some weird things. An OK read but very repetitive. Yale likes it traditions, we don't need 100 pages to tell us that, 10 would have sufficed."
5,"Wow, is this stuff great!","Why is it great! If I wake up in the middle of the night and drink some of this, mixed in water, I go back to sleep easier and sleep deeper...and when I wake up I feel better. I notice a definite difference taking this, than when I don't (Warning: This is only for LOW blood sugar, if you have HIGH blood sugar they have a different product). But it works, of course if you mix it with Sprite it won't work quite as well, it's not magic juice, it's just sensible nutrition. The other product I rave about (hey, maybe I'll write a review!) is Joint Vibrance by the same company, it's their version of Glucosamine, Condroitin, MSM and it works just as well, for me at least. It's expensive, but not as expensive as one visit to the doctor."
1,almost there not quite,The book was a good sized book but the pictures were small and dark. I loved that it was the classic Pooh but the colors were not grouped and you couldn't figure out why some colors were done more than once and others not at all.I love Pooh books but I wouldnt buy this one again.
2,Useless without the CD/tape,"After researching ESL books, I bought this for self-study for my wife, but it is useless without the audio content (CD).The content itself looked interesting.I returned the book because I couldn't find the CD, which is hard-to-find or very expensive."
1,Virtually useless,"Without the Teacher materials, this is useless. Without the Teacher materials, this is useless. Without the Teacher materials, this is useless."
5,Lifesaver!,"I looked all over for this Elastikon tape. I was given one roll at the ER and I thought it was the last roll in existence! Then behold, I found this wonderful store that sold a box of Elastikon 1 inch rolls. This product is stretchy and adhesive at the same time, and I give it my highest recommendation for injuries like a fracture or splinting. It arrived in 2 days, perfect condition, in the original Johnson and Johnson box. Thank you for being there when I needed you!"
1,Good Ones,"I bought these for my kids toys, been using these for almost 2 months now.I am happy with the product."
2,Junk,"This was junk. Kids only played with it for a fe minutes. Just was not a quality toy. Did not expect much, did not get much."
3,Does not transform,I mistakenly purchased thinking it transformed. It is an exact replica of Bumble Bee from the movie but just sits in the corner. My son likes it but doesn't play with it like the other transformer toys.
3,"Up the Irons! Er, violins...","I was a little nervous about purchasing this CD after reading the previous review, but after passing it up a few times, I decided to take the plunge. I have to say that I am an avid Iron Maiden fan, and have been for 20 years. With that disclaimer, I will say that this cd may not appeal to someone who has a passing interest in Maiden, or the album Piece of Mind. After firing up the CD for the first time, I listened with apprehension to the opening of the first song ""Where Eagles Dare"". The intro begins with horns and drums, and I thought, ""eh, this is okay, at best"". And, then, the violins kicked in. Wow! They managed to soar, and to so closely mimic Bruce's voice, that I was happy to buy the cd, if only for that song alone. I do agree with the previous reviewer regarding some of the flaws of the album, but I felt that, overall, the performances of several tracks really shone, including Still Life, The Trooper, Quest for Fire."
2,ropes/strings can be dangerous,"I didn't purchase this toy for my little toy yorkie, but I did buy something very similar to this chew toy. It was also a chew toy with a shape of a bone, there're also 3 strings/ropes attached at the end of the ""bone"". One day I found the 3 strings were missing, didn't pay attention to it, thought my dog just misplaced them somewhere. 2 or 3 weeks later, found one string in her poo. I was shocked. Then even more shocking, the other 2 came out of her body in later in that week too!! This is just too scary. I don't know how my dog took those strings off the ""bone"" but she must be very smart to untie them.... if you really like this toy, I would recomment you to take off the strings before you give it to your baby dog."
4,Great for my extreme yorkie,"my yorkie who's 5 lbs goes through everything he'll tear everything up including big rope twisties i've returned at least 20 different toys at petsmart. i finally tried this one aside from the strings which was not a big deal, this toy has last weeks so far and is his fave toy. my york was said to be an extremely aggressive chewer too"
2,Material comes off easily!,"I am a breeder and thought this would be a nice toy to send home with my puppies. I gave a few of them to the puppies here and within minutes they had removed the material part. As others have mentioned it can be dangerous for chocking. I think the company should have done a better job of researching this with ""real puppies"" before putting it on the market."
1,See review before buying,My puppy had the strings tore off of the barbell within a few days creating a potential chock hazard. I tried to tie them back on but they did not stay. I think this item isn't constructed well for a puppy.
1,"cute, but not functional","This toy was super cute and it caught my eye at the store because it was smaller! Perfect for my 4 month old toy poodle! However, almost as soon as I gave it to her, she almost had the ties and rope off. I retied them and gave it back. She managed to almost get them off again! I took them off and threw them in the garbage. Then, after a half and hour of chewing, there were small teeth holes and chunks missing. Like I said, it was cute, but I was glad that I was staring right at her when she was chewing it, otherwise it could have been an unpleasant trip to the vets!"
2,"My puppy loves this, but it is very UNSAFE!!","I only tolerate this toy, because it's one of the few toys that my puppy will chew on for long periods of time. This toy has serious safety issues, and I will only let her play with it when I can supervise her. She is a toy dog, isn't an aggressive chewer, and is normally easy on her toys. However, the little dangly ties at the end of the barbell are always coming off, and I am constantly chasing after her to prevent her from swallowing the ties when they become loose. I have already lost the green/blue rope tie comprised mostly of threads. For the most part, I have re-tied the ropes using various types of knotts, and have found that after about a month, the ties don't become loose as much because her saliva has made them stiff. Also, the end of the barbell is beginning to discolor and crack."
2,Not thrilled,"My puppy hasn't played with this one much. However, in the short time he has played with it, he has managed to get two of the ties off. Be Careful! Also, I was shocked at how small the barbell was. I paid $7 for this on Amazon and it was at Petsmart for $4. If not for shipping cost, I would definitely return it."
5,"a little outdated, but the only book of its kind","This book is fantastic. It delves very heavily into the history and character of mathematics and particularly mathematicians. Furthermore, it shows all the tantalizing structures to numbers that most people ignore. This kind of point by point scrutiny of the landscape of numbers is very enlightening and indeed interesting. There is also a lot of humor in the writing, which is much appreciated.The only problem is the outdated state of the book. I can only wonder what new amazing things we have discovered floating up in the hundreds of digits of numbers that have appeared to us thanks to our invention of computers. The beasts there are much more curious and bizarre (as many functions that we take for granted only appear as nice as they do because we examine them when they are close to a few select points close to 0)."
2,Eh. Not my kind of movie.,"I am not a Samurai-movie connoisseur but...I did not really enjoy the movie. The music of the movie seemed too modern for the genre. Also, since the Japanese speakers did little gesturing during conversations, it was difficult at times to discern who was speaking especially in a group setting. The plot was rather slow and not terribly interesting. The only bright spot was the audience's glimpse into the Japanese life at the tail-end of the samurai era. If you like slow movies in the samurai genre, you may enjoy this film."
2,"TENTATIVE AND MUDDLED, IT SIMPLY TRUDGED THROUGH WHAT COULD'VE BEEN AN INTERESTING TWIST ON SAMURAI'S SAD END","FOR ME, IT BECAME TOO TOUCHY-FEELY, too soap operatic. Then too, the writing and directing didn't break any new ground or remind me of the many great movies of its genre.Shrug. Oh well."
4,Hana: The Anti-Samurai Movie,"This movie follows a young samurai as he goes from strict adherence to the samurai code by seeking vengeance for the death of his father to a dawning realization that there's more to life than simply an honorable death.As others have mentioned, there's very little action in this movie. Only two very short sequences, neither of which follows the classic samurai sword fight scenario. Instead, there's a great deal of comic dialog and situations.It's a good film. Although somewhat long, the only place it really drags is during a rather long digression that focuses on a secondary character. I believe the director is trying to use the digression to show that the role of peasants in the era was not always as simple and lacking in tragedy as the rest of the film portrays, but it mainly serves to interrupt the main story and further slow the pacing.Still, an entertaining film well worth watching."
3,Great intro to hiking,"I purchased this book for my daughter (9) after we went on a fun hike together. It has some good tips and easy-to-read chapters. Most importantly to me, it allows her to take part in (or take charge of) the planning for our mother-daughter hikes. It was exactly what I was hoping for."
5,Mozart Club,"This entire album is a veritable blend of rhythm and meaningful lyrics. At first, I was drawn to it because of the musical arrangement. Then, when I went back and listened to the lyrics, I realised their universality and whilst they could have meaning for Kerschen, I found meaning for myself. For example, track 5, ""Payphone"" is reminiscent of picking up a telephone whilst your computer is utilising the phone line for access to the Internet. However, with this song there is a mellifluous connection and it spoke to me much like Rudyard Kipling's novel, ""Captains Courageous"". Every time I listen to this track, I get goose bumps. Indeed, the album adroitly transitions from hope to lugubrious longing to psychedelic discovery to realisation of hypocrisy and finally pensive introspection. Themes we can all relate to, but only Kerschen can articulate as a one-man band i.e. a true troubadour for his generation."
3,"Good, but you need power","I bought this game with the premise that Wings Simulations web site was correct, a minimum requirement was P166 with a 3D board; on the box, the minimum is a PII and a board. On my system [pentium pro 200 with Voodoo], it runs, but slowly. After tweaking the setup, it is acceptable, but lacking since the graphics move slowly and jerky. The game itself is well done, and the play-time is fun and seems to be pretty realistic. It is a 3 star overall, 4 to 5 with a power system."
5,The only WW II Tank Sim Worth Owning,"First off. This is a Simulation, not an Arcade Shoot-em-up. If you just jump into this game and expect to survive, forget it. The AI is pretty tough and keeping your platoon alive is something you're going to have to work hard at. If you want to feel what it was like to be a Tanker during World War II, then this is the game for you. Wing Simulations, the publisher, has a customer service website that is unsurpassed by any company marketing games today. The game has 80 missions (40 per side) and can be played as single scenarios or as linked campaigns. A really engrossing game."
1,Crash and freeze-up outstanding game,"I've tried about 20 games since getting the game about a week ago and everyone of them have ended in a system freeze or crash. But the graphics and game play are teriffic. Once you master the six or seven key stroke combinations needed to get everything moving where and how you want it to it has a great level of involvment and need to pay attention to everything going on. This is a game that will be great in a couple of months once all the absolutly necessary patches are made available, but it's ""not ready for prime time"" just yet."
4,Great Chemistry tutoring book,My tutor and I use this for chemistry. I am a fair student and this book helps explain alot of terms to me. Molecular geometry is hard for me to understand but after I read this book I understood it with few questions
3,made cheap,"My Kids had a Dirt Devil for years, was wonderful. Bought this after Dirt Devil wore out, and this fell apart on the same day we purchased it. You cannot use the attachments at all, as the piece breaks where they connect."
3,Fun Toy but NOT Durable,"My 16 month old son loves this toy but I get tired of picking up all the pieces of it and putting them back on. The front tool compartment never stays closed and neither does the ""bag"" area. He rips these off because of that so at the end of the day we put them back on. I think I am going to follow another reviewer's advice and glue them on permanently. He has left it running quite a bit and the batteries are still working so that's a plus. Overall I think the manufacturer could do a much better job of making it more durable and worth the $25.00."
5,falls apart but fun while it lasts!,"My one year old son LOVES this toy! He will push it around the house forever. However, he can also remove the door where the attachments are kept (so of course, all the attachments as well), the front cover, and the side ""vent"". We have pretty much stripped it of anything removable and he still enjoys pushing it. I would prefer a toy without so many removable parts. We may try the Dirt Devil that others seem to have had better luck with."
2,Do not waste your money!,This toy is a piece of junk! It didnt even last a day without the hoses coming off. Very dissatisfied
3,Not worth the money.,"We bought this for my three year old for Christmas last year. She wasn't very intersted in it at the time. She may have been a little young for it. However, just a few months later when she wanted to play with it - it didn't work at all. You can buy other children's vacuums for half the price. I don't recommend this one!"
4,Twice in the garbage,"I bought this vacuum for my son last christmas because he always wanted to vacuum with the big one. He did like it and used it. However, it had a funny burning smell one day & I took it apart to find out the wires had shorted out. In the garbage it went after only 2 months of use. My son asked for another one about 6 months later and we tried it again, almost the same thing except this one lasted one afternoon. It got so hot that the insides started melting and the wires were smoking again. Well we sure don't need a third one. He can help with the real vacuum. A sure disappointment for him."
4,Just like Daddy's...,My 15 month son loved this vacuum. He loves to get it out when Daddy vaccums to be just like his daddy. My only complaint is the front plastic piece comes off easily - but overall I would recommend it to any other mom of boys or girls who love to vaccuum!
4,Not sure it actually picks up dirt. . .,"I purchased this for my son who is fascinated with my vacuum. It requires batteries, but the result isn't as loud as I thought is would be (that's good and bad!). It's tough for him to push on a carpet, but the detachments and their compartments keep him busy for a bit! Overall, it is very durable--he crashes into furniture with it and it is still functioning fine--and something he actually seeks out when it is not in plain view. I'd recommend it!"
1,Flimsy Piece of Junk,"This looks like the real thing and the kid loves it. Unfortunately, the construction of this toy is terrible. Attachment doors, face panels, and hose attachment fall off repeatedly and finally broke after moderate use.I'd be more than happy to spend money to purchase another toy vacuum cleaner, however I will NEVER buy this one again!!!!"
3,"Great fun, but not well-made","My 3 year old son loves his Hoover, but it was obvious on the first day that it would not hold up well. The attachments do not stay in their slots after only a few times of removing and replacing them. For the price, I would say that it is not worth it."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY AND WAY OVER PRICED!!!!!!!!!!!,"My son is in LOVE with vaccums and we thought this would be the perfect Birthday gift. Well, the hose broke within the first five minutes of opening it. I would also like to mention that the price is way too high for this cheap plactic toy....and it really doesn't work that well. I am very disappointed in the price and the quality of this toy. Please shop around before purchasing one of your own."
3,My son is obsessed with vacuums.....,"My 2 year old son has loved vacuums since he was a baby. He had a Dirt Devil for about a year that he wore out. I bought this Hoover for something different. He's been playing with it constantly but the durability is a concern of mine. I can't get the hose to come apart to put on the attachments. The attachment door will not stay closed (seems like an easy fix for the manufacturer and a common complaint that should be fixed). The filter won't stay on either. He doesn't mind any of this, but you'd think these problems could be fixed. I may have to take it back since he can't use the hose part of it and that was 1/2 the reason I chose this particular vacuum."
5,We're Cleaning House!,"Grand-baby loves this toy. It really picks up, and looks just like the real thing! She gets so excited when we bring out the real vacuum and she gets to bring out hers. We totally reccomend it!"
2,Great Idea. Not well built!!!!,"I have twins so I bought two of these. They both started falling apart after one play session. All of the doors and attachments fell off and now they won't stay on or in their holders. I would love to send them back, but my one twin would be devistated to loose his vacuum cleaner this quickly after receiving it. It was a gift for potty training. I would have loved to spend a little more and gotten a better product."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,Shortly after buying the toy the hose for the attachments to connect to broke right off. My 4 year old daughter was VERY upset. It is NOT WORTH THE MONEY.
4,Vacum Freak,"My kid (21 Months) is just obssessed with Vacums and he has been like that for a while, he would take vacum parts from our regular vacum and play with them and throw a fit when we would take it away. Recently he was at someones house and he took over the toy vacum and wouldn't let it go, so thats when i decided to get him this Hoover, and he is just obssessed with it.I wonder what it is that makes these kids obssessed with Vacums ?I wonder if there is any research out there or someone can look into this further."
1,teaches girls how to clean up for their husband!,this is the perfect toy for a little girl. it has a great education value of teaching a girl how to clean up after her husband when she grows up! it also teaches how to be a house mom and use a vacume when they grow up!
1,the toy you never stop putting back together,"This toy falls apart more than the kid plays with it. EVERYTHING comes off and has to be put back on. My son loves it and he will play with it but you are constantly putting all and I do mean ALL (the filter cover, the expected attachments, the front and the clear plastic compartment cover) I bought this for him for Christmas and I am finally today throwing away the front plate on this because I am tired of putting it back on the thing and I don't think my son will miss it. Wish I had purchased something else."
3,"Fun toy, not very sturdy","I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son. He loves to help me around the house, especially with the vacuuming. He plays with it quite often and ""helps"" me with the rugs. He enjoys it very much.However, within the first two days we had managed to either lose or break off the front panel, the clear door where the attachments go and the vacuum bag. They reattach easily, but come off even easier. I think it would be better if they ditched the vacuum bag and made the front not removable."
4,Fun but watch out for dirt!,"I bought this for my 12 month old nephew. He loves this vacuum more then any other toy he has. And he has a lot. He learned so much from it. Watched mommy and vacuumed with her. The only problem is that the cover comes off very easy. You will have to tape it. The hose broke off with him pulling it a few times. Like most kids he put his mouth around it. He sucked out a bunch of dust and dirt from the vacuum. The house is always clean so this vacuum really does pick up things you never knew you had around. After I saw what he was doing I pulled it out of his mouth. He had a dust ball in his mouth that did not taste very good. He got over it but if I hadn't seen him with that in his mouth who knows how much more could of gotten in. We have now super glued that part. So, if you think it doesn't pick up it really does. And when you see your child starting to put the hose in their mouth watch out. Other then that, he loves it!!!!!"
3,great fun but falls apart with little use,Like many of the other reviews it's very cheaply made. The tool compartment door is already broken off before my daughter even used it. The front of it that says hoover was a part to assemble. It wasn't put together correctly in the factory but I was able to make it work. We just recieved the hoover this evening and my 4yr old daughter has already vacuumed the whole house. She loves it
4,I Want the Next Jessica Darling Book!,"I bought this book just so I could read Megan's story about Jessica and Hope and Sarah Dessen's story. Both were awesome! But then I started reading the other stories and a lot of them are really good too. I didn't really understand them all, but I still think it's a good book. I don't read many short stories so this book was a interesting change for me."
4,Worth it for the Jessica Darling story!!!,"Some stories I totally loved like the ones by Megan, Sarah Dessen, Zoe Trope and Carolyn Mackler. Others weren't my style but were worth the effort like the one by Ned Vizzini. Some I won't bother to mention because I just couldn't get into them at all! Overall I think it's worth the money to get a fix of Jessica Darling until Megan's next book comes out. I really liked learning more about her friendship with Hope."
5,"Great, truthful book","I was persuaded to read this book since its by megan mccafferty. This was a great book and I enjoyed reading all the stories. All the stories were entertaining and honest. With a justa hint of humor,entertainment,honesty and sexuality, this portrays the reality of being a 16 yr old teenage girl. Displaying teenage love, angst and friendship. I'd reccommend thsi book to all teens out there even adults."
3,Only okay,"I agree with others who said this was only mediocre. MM is a greatly talented writer. Her Jessica Darling books are among my all-time favorites. However, this Sixteen book is so disjointed. Some of the stories really rock, while others really suck. Megan could have picked better, IMHO."
2,?,"Seeing other reviews of this book left me feeling slightly confussed. Personally, I found it horrible. It was full of stories that had been writen so long after the event, that it had lost all emotion tied to it. However, Sixteen has appeared on many "" Greastest Teen Books..Ever!"" lists, although might I add so did the WHOLE Princess diarys series, which lost them a bit of credability. A compelation of , in my opinion, a little too-short, short stories, Sixteen just doesn't have any meat to it. I was required to read it over the summer, otherwise I would probably have quit less than halfway through. Don't waste ya money.If you must...check it out."
2,I Agree With The Others,"I defenitly agree with all of the others. Some of the stories were good... Like 3 or 4... the Sarah Dessen one, Sarah Mylnowksi one, Sonya Sones and Megan McCafferty's own also the Interview one and maybe one or two others. Others were complete and utter crap. Like others said... sometimes i didnt even know if the characters were girls or boys and some of them were just plain wierd. I recommend borrowing it from the library and reading only the stories you want... this isnt a good book to read cover to cover. I guess ive lost so respect for Megan McCafferty on this one. This is defenitely not a good present for a soon to be sixteen year old."
2,Horrible.,"This book was a huge disappointment... I didn't even want to finish it, actually, but I just kept going with hopes that it might get better. The stories were very vague and poorly written, in my opinion... Just because it's a collection of ""short stories"" doesn't mean that details have to be omitted... Half the time I wasn't even sure of the genders of the characters, especially in ""Relent/Persist."" And finally, I didn't find that a single story in that book would be easy to relate to. Some of the topics were completely off the wall, like ""Rutford Becomes a Man."" Oh well, at least Sarah Dessen's story made it worthwhile, along with Megan's prequel... Still, don't waste your money..."
1,16 was not like this at all....,"Wow, I was looking forward to the normal teenage girl stories I've read like Sloppy Firsts, Georgia Nicholson's, Feeling Sorry for Celia,ect. but most of these were really out there & are grossly perverted. Sure, everyone can use a lil perversian but they were way overblown. Most of the charectors are empty shells doing confussing things (sucking on their best friends nipple then having her dad give her oral sex... alrighty then did not need to read that garbage.Do not be fouled by the happy cover of this book. It is a sham of happiness. And stories about people sweet & bitter 16's they were not! Bleh... I'm bored even writing about this book....I can say three stories were good, the first one ""The Perfect Kiss"" and ""Fifteen going on"""
3,"I don't know what it's growing, but it's big!","It's a fun planter, but the grass doesn't look like the picture. It looks like it's growing broccoli. It's long, stringy, and looks ridiculous."
4,Nice,Overall what I expected. Shipped quickly and arrived like it was supposed to. Good stocking stuffer or small gift item!
4,A blast from the past,"I can't wait to give this to my dad for Christmas. He gave me a Scoobie-Doo Chia pet when I was younger and it was a lot of fun to watch it gain hair. Almost 10 years later, it's his turn to open one. Unless it doesn't work the way our original did, I don't foresee this review being adjusted. If you're looking for something that's fun and interesting, this is for you."
3,Good Quality - Bad Reception,For the price this product is worth it. The construction is nice quality. As long as you have choices of where you place it in the shower because you'll have to find the station you want & then move it around until you get clear reception. And of course if you change the station you'll have to move it again. But it's worth it to me. I like have music in the shower!
5,Head and Shoulders above other Superhero Books!,"First of all, when I saw that it's the X-men meets Count Dracula I laughed and was exremely skeptical about that mix. But let me tell you, the way Dracula is portrayed in this novel is very impressive. He's charming, witty, intimidating, cunning and powerful! His confidence resonates and clashes nicely with the X-men team. But most of all I want to point out, that Byers is a great storyteller. Most superhero books are just action and characters talking to each other, but Byers incorporates more passion into his storytelling. For example, Byers often ""freezes time"" and describes in great details what the characters are thinking during a battle, and I really appreciate that, it's so much more interesting than just reading about who attacked who, and what happened. This is a great read, if you like action with great description that won't seem rushed, I wouldn't miss it."
2,"Okay, But not the best","I like reading X-Men Books in the past, but reading this one about demons and vampires was a little crazy. I did like the fact that they still openly say that Night Crawler is a Christian. And thats my 2cents."
1,This battery sucks. Get the Lenmar,"So I thought I'd just try the even-cheaper version of this type of battery. I've got two of the Lenmar variants, which work fine, but they have a silver body. This black one is half that price, but should be avoided. A $10 lesson I guess. Won't charge out of the box, used for a little while as it seemed to have around 50% charge, then charged again, no result.Oh well, back to the Lenmar LIC 911:Lenmar LIC911 Lithium-ion Camcorder Battery Equivelent to the Canon BP-911, BP-914 and BP-915 Batteries"
1,Extremely Disappointing,"A friend mentioned this book to me knowing that, as I am originally from Utah, I'm always looking for stories set there. But I just don't get it - the other reviews of this book that is. I was looking forward to this one as something for both myself and my children. However, in reading it I found the prose to be flat and listless - to compare the writing to Tom Robbins is incomprehensible. The writing was trite and the story predictable. And I can, unfortunately, understand why no major publisher picked it up. It's a good idea, but the realization of that idea leaves a lot to be desired. I really wasn't interested in either the characters or whether or not they accomplished their goal, which is really a rather silly goal when you think about it anyway. I hate to start the new year this way, but maybe Mr. Lane should stick to his business in the wilds of Los Angeles instead of writing. I found this a very disappointing experience."
1,does not work,"Returned the first unit for no display.2nd unit has display, but makes no sense,If I had a car, I would return it,just have to take the loss and move on."
5,Very fine rare vintage soul!,I love this stuff. The disc doesn't miss. Put it in press play and drift away to a long ago era with a fresher sound!
1,Junxie XL at its worst,"If you like Junxie XL's fist two albums DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. All this is is a bunch of euro-pop radio hits. It is 100% crap. I cannot believe that the same group that gave me such great albums as Saturday Teenage Kick and Big Sounds of the Drag, put out this stuff. Junkie XL, please go back to your roots, because if this is the direction of your music I and everybody else that loved your early works will no longer support you."
2,Beware,"The product is great for a temporary fix...But if you are looking for a life long-lasting product, this is not for you. Even though the warranty is great, it's only for a year; one mistake and the product is un-functional forever. This product is truley not worth the money, time or energy...Trust me I've owned the DS907 and two DS1025"
4,"Good stuff, but...","Having indulged in the works of Prof. Schickele whom I call the ""Weird Al"" of Classical Music (Sorry, Al) for ten years now, I give this collection thunderous applause, especially for the fact that it FINALLY includes the ""Sanka Cantata!"" However, it's my personal opinion that it pulled up one album too soon. Had it included ""Portrait of P.D.Q. Bach,"" there would be no need to wait for Vanguard or Schickele or whoever to remaster the rest of the Vanguard PDQ catalogue. But, since it doesn't, I'm noting my objection here.I like the extended liner notes, though."
4,Excellent summary,These book has been invaluable as a study aid as I have prepared for my doctoral exams. It has excellent new chapters on Rho family proteins and the new information about the relationship of signaling to cell motility. There is also an excellent review that is a bit of the history of the field. This was a great help in getting my bearings in the area.
4,magical!,What a lovely book that makes one realize how far butterflies travel and how interconnected we are with them. A good book for young children - and for those who read to them. Well done!
1,BEWARE!,"This is a really great movie, unavailable on DVD. I'm sure that's why there seem to many cheap copies being sold on Amazon. This tape is valued at $50. If you see it for sale at less than $40, be sure to read the description carefully. Bootleggers rarely use the words 'authentic' or 'original'. Also beware if all of the seller's titles come with 'artwork cut to fit hardcase'. You should email the seller specifically to ask whether their tape is authentic or a copy. Click on 'customer images' to see how to identify a bootleg so you don't get ripped off like I was!"
3,Cute but not very functional,"Having owned a Kershaw knife for years, I guess I was expecting a little more from this one. The blade is very sharp and well designed, however I found the overall design of the tool to be poorly thought out. The ""one hand thumb hole opening"" feature"" requires much more effort than it should. The locking collar for the carabineer clip is very loose, and often unlocks itself just from normal handling. The grip behind the blade allows you to apply a lot of force to the screwdriver bits, but when you do they fold back into the tool. The bottle opener is nearly useless; the first time I tried it, it took 4 attempts to open the bottle and reduced the bottle cap to a twisted mess.That being said, the tool is cute, the blade is nice, but it is more suited to a mutli tool collector than someone who actually needs a tool to get something done."
5,Dillards Maintain Their Altitude,"I have a UK print of this, entitled'Country Tracks' and it's been a firm favourite since far too long ago. The bluegrass singing and playing are just impeccable.Hard to recall just what switched my attention in this direction, perhaps it was the 'Duelling Banjos', then getting some airplay due to the recent popularity of Boorman's 'Deliverance' movie. This is one perfect collection, the Beatle's covers totally absorbed into the Dillard sound and their own songs as brilliant as those by other pens; 'Reason To Believe', or 'Rainmaker' for example. The disc came flooding back as we watched,'Oh Brother'(much to the chagrin of nearby viewers who requested a cessation to my vain karioake efforts)."
5,The Dillards are The Darlins of Andy Griffith fame.,Love the Darlin's. Who wouldn't? I guess you have to be a baby boomer trivia buff to even associate the two. But the cd is great. This is the 2nd Darlin's tape I have had and I love them both. Bluegrass and folk music you'll love. My favorite track is Doolie.
5,The Dillards are Darlings!,"I wanted this CD as kind of a novelty; I thought it would be neat to have some of the songs I'd heard on The Andy Griffith Show. I am so pleased with the entire CD! The Dillards have a much broader range than I expected, including their own versions of a couple of Beatles songs. I enjoy listening to it for the pure musicianship and precision in the instrumental arrangements."
4,Classic time travel from a classic author,"Time travel is a favorite sf theme and certain cause-and-effect problems are built into any time travel story. ""Can you change the past?"" is the most obvious one. Anderson, one of the inventors of the ""time patrol"" story (and they're still some of the best), took the view, at least for the purposes of the narrative, that history is not immutable but still is not easily altered. There's no ""butterfly effect"" in his world. You have to attack history at certain nexus points. And that's what the Bad Guys do in these stories, aiding Hannibal's assault on Rome, replacing Cyrus of Persia, and so on. Anderson knows his history, certainly. The five stories here all were originally published in the magazines and were republished in book form in various configurations, so it's a bit difficult to know that you've located all of them. The style is pure 1950s and `60s and entirely enjoyable."
1,Stay away,"I am a John Patrick fan. As such, it is disappointing that this book is so bad.I think Patrick's money management systems are among the best. In this book however, he tells you to take your money off of the table when you are ahead by a given amount. No major casino with a poker room in the United States will let you do that. This is only the first of many problems with this book.There are many good books on poker for the beginner. This isn't one of them."
1,The Worst Poker Book Ever Written?,"Among serious poker players, this book is a total joke.Its incomplete or wrong on all aspects of the game, bar none.The good news is that Lee Jones, Lou Krieger, and Roy West have written excellent beginners books on poker, available here on Amazon.com."
1,Would Prefer to Give No Stars,"John Patrick might be able to play poker. This book, however, would be no help at all to a beginner and totally useless to anyone who has played regularly for any length of time. I don't know that I could play better than Mr. Patrick, although I have been a winning player for years, but anyone who counted on the advice from this book to make her or him a winner would not have a chance.Mr. Patrick writes books on how to win at casino games and he probably isn't stupid enought to believe that one can, so his intellectual honesty has to be questioned by any serious thinker."
1,Not Fun At All,"I got this game because I thought it'd be something fun to do at a party. There are spelling errors on basically every single card, the headlines are obvious and stupid, and it's boring. Reading some of the headlines and choices, I wouldn't play it with anyone under the age of 13 as well.To say the least, it's not what I expected at all. Most of the headlines are pointless, making it easy to guess the correct answer. That makes the game even more boring because you're just going to win quickly. In general, I was really disappointed."
4,A fascinating account of a neglected social problem.,"When I first saw this book, I was intrigued by the title.Who, or what, are The Mole People? Upon reading the back coverand inside flaps, I couldn't believe that people actuallylived underneath New York City. Jennifer Toth has revealeda startling phenomenon, one that probably very few peopleknow about. She describes her encounters with the New YorkCity Police and the many individuals who live underground.Because this is the first real examination of this problem,the book focuses more on documentation than on solutions.There's nothing wrong with that, because in order to solvea social problem, people need to know that it exists. Thisbook describes apalling living conditions, probably the mostdesperate conditions conceivable, at least in this country.Highly recommended."
2,Lost me halfway through.,"This was a good book, not a great book, just good. I was interested in the subject matter, but I felt the people became blurred and the events all seemed to be the same after about 100 pages. I started out caring about these people and then just became bored with their lives."
1,Really not worth the read,"I read this for a bookclub and was very disappointed. I was eager to hear true stories of homeless life in New York, but what I got was barely readable fantasy. It seems to me that Ms. Toth wrote a successful article on this topic for the L.A. Times and then decided to 'cash in' and make it into a full-blown book. Only problem is that she didn't do any research, fact checking, or even actually visit many of the places she claims to have visited. The whole production feels so slapped together, for example chapters on subway graffiti (interesting, but not really related at all to the subway dwellers), fictional accounts of living underground (HG Wells....) etc. Many stories are repeated several times throughout the book, presented as if we had never herad about them before when we had read the same exact thing a few pages ago! Who edited this? This work can at best be called irresponsible journalism. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
1,incompetent!,"While the author's experiences with the homeless may or may not be genuine, her experiences with the tunnels themselves are inaccurate, half-right or downright false."
2,Trying hard to finish it,"I don't know or really care how much of this book is accurate. The subject matter has great potential as fiction or non-fiction but I just can't get past the writing style. I'm about half-finished and should have gotten into the author's ""flow"" by now. Instead, I'm still finding her over-use of adjectives irritating and amateurish. It feels like I'm reading something my daughter wrote as a high school English essay. As far as the stories go, nothing's really grabbed me yet. They're somewhat interesting but not fascinating by any stretch. I'll struggle through the rest of the book and hope it improves..."
4,Innocent Accounts of the Hidden Homeless. Groundbreaking,"Definitely not a desired leisure read, ""The Mole People"" is a provocative look at the homeless population who lives in the tunnels below Manhattan. Toth brings stark innocence and an intriguing lens by which the reader becomes aware of the fascinating stories of those who live in the tunnels.This book is not for someone who has few hours to spare and wants a quick read. While this book is written very simply, the content can be graphic and may unsettle the reader. The lives of the homeless are not as pretty nor as glamourous as many public policy makers would like us to believe.I recommend this book for anyone who is studying sociology, social work, is a city dweller, or who holds strong opinions about the homeless. This book could change an opinion about the homeless and how they should be treated."
5,A fascinating look at underground life,"How can anyone claim that they ""know"" there are no mole people? Have you personally searched every tunnel under New York? Whether or not there are seven levels under Grand Central Station, there is certainly a network of tunnels under New York, and why *wouldn't* homeless people take up residence in them? I'm not claiming that I ""know"" Toth is telling the truth, either, but I find it hard to believe that not a single person is living there. And if the mole people are real, do you really think the police would readily admit it? Of *course* they scoff at the idea!In any case, the book is fascinating and highly recommended."
3,Dull....Too bad,The author has a great subject in hand but never seems to be able to touch the reader...She lacks creativity and makes the whole story very dull. Too bad!!! Also the message to Blade at the end of the book that she didn't see/say anything is lame.
1,Not Even Good For Fiction,"I couldn't finish this book because it reads way too much like bad fiction. I Googled when it wasn't feeling right and dozens of experts have debunked her ""facts"". Toth does a really vague interview for the documentary Voices In The Tunnel - it's kind of embarrassing. She supplies no details, just statements about homeless people in general. It's insulting once you spend a little time researching all the facts that she didn't bother looking up when she wrote this book."
5,Addictively Good,"This book was intriguing enough for me to engage in a marathon read to finish it. I was captivated by this society that, by all rights, should be fictional. It seems wrong for me to be as enamoured by this subject as I was; it seems too much like gawking at a traffic accident. Nonetheless, this was an excellent book that is far better than it should be, considering the subject matter."
5,stays with you,I just came across this title in my Amazon recommendations. I read it about 15 years ago and I STILL think about it and recommend it. Absolutely fascinating. I would love to see a follow up to this story.
3,interesting but sentimental,"Jennifer Toth opens the reader to a new world with a voice that seems too sentimental at times, but cannot take away from the compelling stories that she tells. The book is chopped up into sections and, as you don't need to follow a thread of plot, is very easy to read. The topic of the book should be enough for anyone interested to pick up the book, but the execution of the book was ordinary."
4,Truth or myth?,"You can definitely tell that Ms. Toth did some writing for the New York Times. Her book reads like a special interest story one might find in a major metropolitan newspapaper. You kind of get the feeling that at least part of what you are reading has been sensationalized or exaggerated for effect. Even if that is true, this is still a very good book. It's interesting, never boring, and makes you think. In a sense she has taken a tearfully sad subject, homelessness, and made it readable for the general public.Though you might not fully believe everything you read in this book, I doubt you will regret the time you invested in it.P.S. I also recommend Ms. Toth's other book, Orphans of the Living, which is an indictment of America's foster care system."
5,"wonderful book, fast shipping!!!","I heard this book was really good, and it is!! It arrived fast and was exactly how it was described!!!"
5,The Mole People,"I did not read it myself, it was part of my daughter's rising 9th grade summer reading list. She seemed to really enjoy the book."
2,Let down,"Being a NY'er I was thrilled to learn of the people who dwelled in the tunnels under me, but was never really connected or learned of a life or community from the book. It was mostly about Jennifer's adventures under there - I wish I really learned a character, learned how they survived, their story of how they got down there and how they fended for themselves. I feel it just skimmed the surface of all those things, I would've liked to be more connected."
3,Kind of boring,Have read other books about people living under the subways. This one was did not keep my attention.
2,Interesting but.....,"The author writes well and has done a great job revealing the hidden homeless of New York City, but I found the content of the chapters to be highly repetitive of the same ideas: the homeless who live underground are different than other homeless; they are drug users and/or mentally ill, in general; they live in horrible conditions; they are treated poorly by each other and by often by whomever they come in contact with (police, etc). For an eye-opening view, borrow it from someone to read to take it out from the library, but it's not worth the money to buy unless, possibly, you're work is in this area."
2,This is classified as nonfiction,"I expected to find this book to be a reasonable piece of journalistic work about people living in the tunnels of NYC. I finished reading it feeling absolutely amazed that the author and publisher pass this work off as nonfiction. Many of the characters and situations she describes just read as pure fiction, and the thought of her exploring the tunnels by herself meeting hundreds of people and not getting hurt or worse is beyond belief. In the final chapter she is literally chased out of NYC by her former tunnel-dweling friend, ""Blade,"" who is now out to kill her! Get real.This book is a terrible disappointment and an insult to serious journalistic reporters."
3,Fun read but sloppy,This was a good read with interesting dialogues but the history and research don't seem to be all that thorough. Anyone living in Manhattan will probably notice some inaccuracies. But if you're just interested in human stories you should probably go for it.
4,Interesting Read about something we don't think about,This book obviously deserves four stars for at least all the researching Jeniifer Toth did for this book. It is creepy and interesting and faszinating and intriguing. A subject I didn't really know much about. After finishing the book I feel much closer to the homeless people around me. I want to pack an extra sandwich to give to them when I go to work. But to not make them look too good: I feel sympathy but I also want to keep my distance. The book talks about some very scary moments and people and situations that creap me out and make me want to stay far away from them. The way she writes though is neither on their side nore not - very objective and you can sort of form your own opinion. Its a great read even though it lacks the flow like another reviewer said before. But is is really interesting.
2,Life in the Tunnels,OK read. Author's viewpoint penatrated the facts of a good story. Who 'is' against helping the homeless? I would have enjoyed it more if the people being interviewed were the story not the writer. The interesting people living in those tunnels are the story. But Jennifer Toth has struck gold with her other reviews; they are all over Google. Shows you what the media knows!
1,Terribly written.,"How Toth could take such an AMAZING subject and make it so incredibly boring is beyond me. Like another reviewer said, she's all over the place - it's like a C- college research paper. She repeats herself time and again as if nobody edited this book, and it's a shame because she must have had volumes of outstanding experiences to work with.I've had friends who squatted in burned out buildings and been with them when they've saved people from being mugged... it's virtually impossible to write about this stuff and NOT capture the vibrance and color of the moment. But she did it."
1,very false,"Anyone who has done a small amount of research about Grand Central Terminal knows that calling that terminal ""Grand Central Station"" is incorrect. The author claims to have spent a significant amount of time in Grand Central Terminal, but still calls it Grand Central Station in the book. That one fact being incorrect shows how false the book is. Sure there are other facts that can be proven wrong, but most people can't prove those facts wrong in 5 minutes of Googling. Calling Grand Central Terminal by it's incorrect name can be proven false by a tiny amount of research."
1,A Place For All The Misfits!!!!,"I have no time or sympathy for ""The Mole People"" as the people who live in the Subways and tunnels are called.They choose to live there where they can spend their days in darkness geting high or drunk. They do not wish to conform to the Rules that may be found in a Homeless Shelter so they drag their children down with them into the darkness.What particularly disturbed me about this book was the profile of the so called ""Mayor Of The Underground"" who discourages people from ever seeing the light of day again. He is portrayed in the book as being a sociopath and rightly so. Just because he has forsaken his own dignity as a human being should not entitle him to try to exert any influence on anybody else's life. The Mole People choose to eat ""track rabbits'"" i.e. rats in a city where 5 star restaurants regularly put out meals from the homeless.The author tries to gain our sympathy for these misguided misfits but all she succeeded in doing was digust me."
4,Another scrumptious book from Davidson,Goldy's catering meals for a law firm and falls over her dead friend. Amazing how she knows so many people who are murdered. Her husband is a dream come true. I enjoy Davidson's books and recipes.
3,"Same old, same old","I enjoy Diane Mott Davidson's book, so I eagerly awaited the new novel, Dark Tort. In theory, there is nothing wrong with this book. The characters are fully developed, as we have followed them for years, so there are no surprises there. But I have to say, the storylines are starting to run together. How many more pages of Goldy drinking espresso or cooking food can I take? I guess I'd like to see more actual action outside of her coffee/food prep."
1,Can't finsh this,"I like Diane Mott Davidson. I liked this story. But, I cannot STAND Barbara Rosenblat's interpretation of this book! EVERY character has a raspy, shaky voice and they all begin to run together. I can't finish this audiobook because the voices are painful to listen to!!!!"
3,Dark Tort - Marginal,"I have every book in the Mott Davidson catering mystery series. Dark Tort was not anywhere near as good as the previous books because Davidson has moved away from the very elements that attracted me to her characters in the first place.In Dark Tort, Goldy does virtually no cooking. In fact, she appears to be moving away from catering and into sleuthing. What makes Goldy Bear's adventures so wonderful is Goldy and her catering business. Davidson's talent is her ability to describe scenes and characters for all of your senses. Her descriptions of Goldy's cooking, personal relationships, family life and interactions are really what attracts me to these books. Dark Tort leaves all of those aspects out.Diane - if you read these, please go back to your roots!"
2,Plodding,"I have read all of Davidson's previous Goldy Bear mysteries and always found them to be page turners. Sadly, this one was not. I actually couldn't finish it. Maybe I'm in the minority, but it didn't rise to the previous books' level of excellence, at least in my opinion."
4,C'mon!,"OK, so maybe this wasn't the best in the Goldy series but to those who gave it only 1 star I take exception. To those who reviewed the book before even finishing it, I take even greater exception. The fact is that, after 13 books, I still love Goldy, Tom, Julian and Marla. I can sympathize with her over Arch's continued teenage angst and sometimes feel like he needs a good swift kick. It was mentioned that Goldy's continued mourning over her friend's death got old. The story takes place over a one week period. I am sorry for anyone who could get over finding their friend murdered in such a short time. As with all of the Goldy books, this one makes you chuckle at times, get the munchies always, and make you feel like Goldy is someone you wouldn't mind having for a neighbor. Although, with her habit of finding dead people, maybe not. The potential for becoming a victim might be too high."
4,A Dishy Read,"Davidson can always be counted on for a good read. The opening scene of this book is particularly well written and unfolds in with riveting and intense detail. Compared to the other books in the series I think the story is a little grittier than previous books. I'd have liked a little more interaction with Marla. I like the way the characters age and grow during the course of the series. The introduction of Gus, so different from Arch, is interesting. With the exception of her husband Tom being too accommodating, the interactions with the police seem more realistic than in previous novels. My favorite part of this book is the way Goldie dishes up dirt on multiple characters when she starts digging. I also like the recipes being placed at the end of the book where it's easy to find them if I want to try one."
3,Good but I have a better writer,"I do enjoy Diane Mott Davidson's books, and this was like the others, enjoyable.But for another homespun detective with lots of recipes, try Joanna Fluke. Hers are the best!!"
2,Disappointed,This book had too much extraneous detail and description. Got tired of hearing about Goldy's son's life and activities when they contribute nothing to the plot. Also got tired of hearing about Goldy being so helpless when in other stories she has more guts. This was a really boring story and I skimmed most of it just to see who was the culprit. I like her writing but this wasn't up to her standards.
4,Dark Tort Review,"I am a huge fan of Diane Mott Davidson's culinary mysteries. While I enjoyed this story, it didn't seem up to par with some of her other stories. Dark Tort seemed to focus less on the cooking aspects, which is one of the things I look forward to in her books. It's definitely worth reading, I've just enjoyed some of her other stories more."
1,First and last book,"I have been wanting to read this author for some time. Finally, this was the book I started with and sadly I just skipped to the end instead of reading the whole thing. Do all her books go on and on about the church activities like this one did? I also thought the age discrepancy was questionable. I may or may not try another one but this one was a huge disappointment."
5,Dark Tort by Diane Mott Davidson,I am hooked on Goldy. Enjoyed this adventure with her immensely. Have started her next book in the series.
3,Sweet Sluthing,"Catering can be lethal, yet Goldy Schulz has managed for 13 outings to entertain fans and add to the calorie count. The recipes are deadly for a diet. The mystery is fun packed. Diane Mott Davidson is a recent addition to our reading list but we'll be hunting for other specimens in this kitchen series.DARK TORT's heroine is doing fine with a law-firm client until she finds her friend and neighbor, Dusty dead. Dusty's mother begs Goldy to look into the matter. Eavesdropping at the home of one of the law firms members Godly hears a conversation that leads her to clues in the kitchen.Enjoy!Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
1,very disappointed!,"I had looked so forward to Mott-Davidson's latest book. It just wasn't as good as the others. I see that there are many other reviews that agree with me. What in the world happened? Has she perhaps, 'passed the torch'?It just doesn't seem like her usual style. It was disjointed, there were a couple of really huge mistakes. She introduced two new characters, insinuating, they had always been there. It was a mess. I can only hope that the next one, if there is a next one, is better. C'mon Diane, don't let us down!"
1,What a downer,"Like others, I have read the whole Goldy Bear Culinary Mystery series and I have enjoyed each book...until now. This book is slow to start and as I am only on page 100 after a week, hasn't picked up speed yet. I can't get past Goldy wallowing in her sorrow. Granted, I have never tripped over a dead body only to find out that it was my neighbor, but enough is enough already. As another reader mentioned, there are a few disjointed parts for example, at one point Marla is driving Goldy to pick up Arch and Gus. A couple of paragraphs later, Goldy is turning into the parking lot...but I thought Marla was driving??? I hope that this book was a fluke and Diane Mott Davidson will come back with a mystery of the same caliber that all of her fans have come to expect and enjoy."
3,Medium-heat only; not a sizzling novel,"The main characters were very familiar; not seeing too many changes in their relationships, with the exception of Arch's half-brother Gus. There was a random assortment of new/old characters to figure out. Some characters were in the story for a brief shining moment and then disappeared. Were they red-herrings or part of the case? The recipes as always were delectable. Tom Schulz is developing into a talented cook himself. It was noticeable that the recipes were not interspersed in the narrative but relegated to the end. Many storyline threads hung on the highly-desired work recipe art of Charlie Baker, which was briefly described. Overall Dark Tort followed in the steps of previous Davidson novels, familiar just like comfort food; but not overwhelming."
3,Just finished Dark Tort,"I have been reading every Goldy book in this series and this one was the least enjoyable. Goldy finally gets rid of the jerk in the last book but was just depressing to read in this one. She spent alot of time grieving over someone we barely read about in her entire series. Also, Goldy mentioned she is in her early 30s. This seems unlikely considering Arch's age. The author needs to advance Goldy's age along with her son's. I will still continue reading the series because I enjoy the characters but this one didn't even seem like the same writer."
4,easy to install,"Got these for my 92 cadillac because the original proportioning valves were rusted and shot. These seem to work just fine. The ones I received were hexagonal shaped from one end to the other,unlike the one in the pic.This makes it very easy to put a wrench on to tighten."
4,Nice mix of mystical presence with modern crisis.,"Very good story. Nice merger of angelic oversight (Tony's deceased child) with his current assignment (protecting Grace and her daughter). For info, page 288 contains a one-time mention of someone named Mrs. Whiting who the reader must assume is the same person as Tony's neighbor Mrs. Cruther!"
4,what a delight,"Finally, a Karen Robards book I would happily recomend. The charactors were well developed. Their relationship was mostly realistic. All and all a good well written story. My only complaint is that there were a couple of charactors who were completely unnecessary, they didn't add to the story and could have been completely absent."
2,Skip this one - I stopped half way through.,"The characters are unlikable, story improbable and the book is just plain boring! The mother is a judge who uses the title to try to control and bully those around her. Was she supposed to be a ""strong woman"" or just an unpleasant one? Her world revolves around her daughter - can anyone see a problem here? Let's not forget the horoscopes that warned her of her future. The cop gets involved with the family, and had a daughter who died and would be the same age as the teenager had she lived. Replacement family? No chemistry, no real story to speak of. If you want the twist in the end, then skip to it and don't bother with the rest of the book."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. I have read many other of Karen Robards' books, and this wasn't one of the better ones. Besides the fact that the book didn't always make sense and flow well, her research was incomplete in at least two areas. First were the things that happened with diabetes that were inaccurate, second was the ""four-door Camaro"" which Chevrolet never made. The Camaro was always a sports car or muscle car, never a family car. These were relatively simple errors that never should have been in a book by Robards, but they spoiled the story for me. Either Robards needs to hire an assistant to do her research, or her editor should edit more carefully."
3,A bit disappointing,"I just love ""Maggy's Child"", ""One Summer"", and ""This Side fo Heaven"" from Karen Robards. So when I bought ""The Midnight Hour"", I was expecting it to be just as good as the other three that I've read. However, it was not. The storyline was interesting, but the book is soooo boring during the first half! I struggled to get throught this, hoping it would get better. The last quarter of the book is the best part, and I thought the ending regarding Tony and his daughter was very sweet. However, I would not recommend this book. Save your money and buy one of the titles listed above instead. I'll have to be more careful about buying Karen Robards books from now on."
3,Average,"Lots of other people have thrashed this game, but I don't think it's really that bad. The computer-like interface isn't too bad once you get used to it, and you can turn off the loading sequence at the beginning which becomes annoying the second time you play the game. Actually, ""Oh Behave"" isn't really a game in itself, but a collection of activities, games and tools. Included are a stylized calculator, a typewriter that can be used with the GB Printer, 4 mini-games, and a selection of wallpaper to decorate your ""desktop"". There is also a bunch of sound clips, but they're really scratchy and hard to hear. There's also a short movie clip but it's really fuzzy and all in blue. Overall, it's a descent package that will be groovy enough for Austin fans to enjoy."
3,It's kind of fun.,"I ordered this game just a few days ago, I think it was kind of fun. The things that are not fun, are that it's set up like a computer. You have to restart it if there's a problem, it has to load when you turn it on, and you have to shut it down when you done.On the back of the game, it says there's TONS of mini-games, but there's only five. I still can't figure out how you download the "" world of tons' of mini games."" I think you should buy another game before buying this on. PS: The Rugrats Movie Game is a really fun chanllnge! The Sherk game is fun too!"
4,cool,hey i wanted this boat for my bday and got it and its cool with nice detailing but what i dont like is there is no rudder one prop spins and the other spins in another dircetion this boat is nice and i actually think this turns better than a rudder
5,Coast Guard Boat,This boat was awesome!! It has very good detail and runs very smoothly. It is great to go out and take on the lake or in a pool whatever fits for you. I would recomend this for anyone who likes boating and radio controlled cars.
2,It's a boat and it floats,"This was purchased as a gag gift and fit the bill perfectly.The build quality is so-so. The details, while well conceived, were poorly executed. It is a 'cute' model, but could have been so much better.It floats and drives around, but the build quality leads me to believe it won't last long.For over $50, I am disappointed. If it cost $30, I would be less disappointed. Truly, I think it is actually 'worth' about $20.Overall, I would say save your money, or just don't have high (or even any) expectations."
5,These are awesome,"7 grams of fiber! I've had all the others...too sweet.. too much fat..these are perfect. I read that someone said these are bland... well..if you are a sugar freak.. then stay away from these, but if you want some thing that will satisfy you and has a nice flavor and need fiber...get these now. The Peanut Butter one tastes great, too!"
3,good,"great snack option (not recommended as a meal substitute - eat some real food!). doesn't taste as great as the peanut butter version, which is awesome (though i don't even like peanut butter). that said, it tastes great, considering there's no sugar. also has fewer calories than comparable energy bars."
3,what you'd expect,"I mean, a sugarless candy bar is not going to be delicious. If you have a sweet tooth as I do but have to reduce sugar intake, then try to get used to these. After a while you notice that real candy bars are way too sweet and you can actually look forward to one of these. If you're the type of person who loves soda, but can't get used to diet soda, then these are not for you."
4,A nice product for a reasonable price,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this quilt. It was a nice gift for my great granddaughter.
3,Only for the tried and true Shred fanatic,"It's obivous from the outset of this CD that Rusty Cooler has been majorly influenced by the great Jason Becker, sure the guys quick and i respect the amount of practice he must have put in. Does have much emotion in his playing? Not alot at all, Jason Becker had MUCH more feeling in his compositions. Most of the hooklines ARE re-hashed lightspeed riffs with many fast licks in between.My advice - If you are looking for a Jason Becker/Joe Satriani style player go no further, however those two have (imho) a much greater compositional depth and not just emotionless shred at all times. I got quite bored with this after a couple of listens, go buy Perpetual Burn by Jason Becker for some real kickin shred tunes."
3,no soul,"rusty is an excellent player with incredible technique. but a friend of mine put it best ""it sounds like he is doing a warmup exercise for the whole album"". overall it is good but I cant listen to it for too long it doesnt keep my interest."
1,Heard it all before,"You know its amazing how these guys that seem to thing sweeping arpegios is something still great to listen to. yer, back in 86, but not now for ****s sake. This guy matches his name when it comes to guitaring, rusty. Macalpine, Becker, Howe, Moore albums of the 80's are much better than this."
2,fast but repetiteve,"no doubt this guy is a great guitarist, but he lacks writing chops. Listening to it I found that every speedy riff is reminscent of the one in any other of his songs."
2,Very Limited,"I'm new to Spanish, but I have studied German and Latin. I'm disappointed. This package only covers present tense. Where's the rest of the language? It does a great job with the present tense. If you are thinking of getting the Platinum version, it's just these Cd's without the printable pdf lessons, required in my opinion, plus useless games on CD ROM. At least I didn't spend a fortune on this."
1,Confusing,I didn't get alot out of the cd's. I found them to be too fast pace and confusing. There are better products out there. I don't recommend it.
4,An interesting read...,"The story was a good one. It didn't hold me as quite a lot of her works have, but it is entertaining and fun to read and if you are a fan of her works, as I am, you will enjoy this one as well."
3,"Should be entitled ""Christmas in the Mental Ward""",The songs on here are really annoying but at the same time kind of funny. The kids will love it but you'll be ready for your own trip to the local psychiatric center after this.
4,Excellent because contains artists less known to collectors,"As a collector of and dealer in Outsider Art, I first read the book and then contacted the author, who at the time was also a dealer. I bought several pieces from him. These artists are less well-known to the self-taught collectors, but most of them are excellent and should be better known."
2,"Sure, it's stylish, but cleaning, folding and using make this chair a NIGHTMARE","If you're looking for style and care about interior design, this chair is great for you.If you care about making feeding as easy as possible for yourself and your baby, FORGET IT! This chair is heavy, cumbersome and hard to fold. The manual shows a happy person easily folding the chair with one foot. You're going to need two feet to fold this monster. I hope you have good balance. Cleaning is a nightmare. Who decided to put all of these crevices in a high chair? The straps are way too long. They don't secure anything. My twins fussed and looked uncomfortable the whole time they sat in these chairs. We went with the Fisher Price Rainforest Chair instead...for the half the price, we're all twice as happy!"
4,No More Quarters!,I spent way too much time at the local pub feeding quarters in to the arcade version of Missile Command. That was 20 years ago. All that's missing here is the need for a pocket ful of change and the dart players that would bump into me at some critical juncture of the game. I was never a master of the original. . . it had something to do with my main activities at the bar. . . but my friend was the best ever. We both played this new game. Good news? Plenty! Great graphics. Greatsound. Just as i hoped it would be. Bad news? You have to keep your kids away from it if you ever want to play!
2,Missle Command,"Its not the excitement that i was hoping for, but its still fun to play every now n then."
5,Very practical book on the Mohs technique.,"The editors and authors do a very nice job of ""how to"" instruction. This would be a nice text for residents during their Mohs rotation or fellowship. I know of no other text that is as complete with practical knowledge on the subject of Mohs micrographic surgery.A wonderful cookbook with useful templates. A must for Dermatologic surgeons, plastic surgeons, or pathologists who practice the Mohs technique for skin cancer removal."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"If you like to create boring items like, a clay covered pen, or fork and spoon, a clay framed license plate cover, this is the book for you!Not only are the items dumb and boring, but she expects you to run out and buy all the extra products just to make one. Nice of her huh?"
3,Education,"The book was fine, just not the activities that I expected. It will be a good resource to have for school based activities."
5,Great book!,"Wonderful read for horse lovers everywhere. Very exciting and entertaining, truly a book to get lost in. Must have for any young reader."
1,Another stupid vampire book,"You know, my major gripe isn't with the contrived plot of this book, the unimaginative characters, or even some of the recycled themes which bog it down. One word...vampires. This is a major part of the story of this novel. I don't mind a mention of the undead in the books I read usually but I can't stomach books which recycle vampirism as a major theme. There is a ton of ton of [stuff] around which is published every year that completely revolve this boring and uncreative plot device. Oliver Johnson and other writers preparing to write a book like this need to consider the fact this idea is a much decayed and smelly moldering corpse which has run its course our collective conscience. In short... Vampires [Stink}!"
3,"Slow to start, unfulfilling to end","This book takes a LONG time to figure out where it's going. The idea of having everything come to pass within the course of one night is innovative, but somewhere in all the flashbacks, the backstory... Things get lost. There were parts I simply put the book down for weeks at a time, because it simply didn't seem worth it. Towards the end, it manages to redeem itself, with a climax that totally makes it worth all the embarassingly long stretches of nothing happening.. ...Which then tapers off into less than nothing. Perhaps one needs to read the complete trilogy to fully appreciate things... But I certainly know I was left feeling like I'd wasted a lot of my time after this."
5,"Enjoyable, can not wait untill book two is released",I loved the story line and the potential for the following books. I just trust that we will not have to wait too long untill the next book is released.
3,the forging of the shadows: Book one,Dark story: Much switching of good vs bad. I had some problem of getting into the story. I have read Book two and am finishing up on Book three so the overall story has kept my attention.
4,The Forging of the Shadows,This was a great book. Thw suspence just keeps on growing and growing. well writen book
3,Fairly rambling,"First of all, I got more than I little sick of everyone in the book just ""happening"" to be able to tell the future. Why yes, I can tell the future. You're blind? You can tell the future too! I dabble in a little future telling myself! Really obnoxious. Secondly, this mask is supposed to give Urthred his powers until his own come back, then why can't he use the mask at all until Thrull? We know his powers are temp. gone, that's what the mask is for!He does get points for making us almost sympathize with the bad guys."
2,This isn't very good...,I was quite disappointed with this novel. The characters are interesting enough but their dialogue and interactions with each other seem very stiff. The antagonists are not interesting. They are very poorly written vampires. I would not recommend this novel to any of my friends. Go read something like 'Gardens of the Moon' instead.
4,This book is one of the top ten books I've ever read,The book was at a climax all the time. I couldn't put it down. It was so good I finished it in 4 days.
3,"An interesting fantasy yarn, but nothing amazing","The Forging of the Shadows is a reasonable read, with some occasional flashes of brilliance, interesting character snaps and diverting plot twists. But the narrative is a little dry and the overall plot is not unique. Fun to read if you like vampires and are not too picky about the storytelling - otherwise skip it."
4,Fresh Approach,"The Lightbringer trilogy brings in a fresh look at fantasy, concentrating mainly in a city for this book (but promising more in the remaining books). It has all the necessary elements, such as an intriguing history and cast of characters to make this trilogy one to remember. Recommended"
5,WoW!,"This book really pulled me into the story and kept me up until late. I highly recommend this book, and the other two in the series, to any fantasy genre reader."
1,The book is good.,"However, the packaging was terrible and the binding got all bent. Barnes and Noble would have never mailed a book in that packaging. It was a gift. In the future, I would pay a little more for a book on Barnes and Noble and have the book arrive in good shape. By the time, I mail it back, I could've gone down to the local BAM and bought two of them. So I will just keep this one and get another book for the gift."
3,"Maybe yes, maybe maybe","These poles arrived very quickly and were as advertised. I have used trek poles for years in doing archaeology in the Flint Hills and I wanted poles to use for urban walks on concrete and asphalt. I got these poles because they were advertised as ""shock absorbing"". Maybe I should have done a little more research. Shock absorbing can barely be felt with the poles, which I have not tried out in the field yet. So the 3 star rating is less the capability of the poles as the description being less than I felt would have told me that when we talk about absorbing shock, we are talking about a ""give"" of 1.0 to 1.5 cm. These poles are a little heavier than my old ones so I'm not sure what my arms will feel like after a day in the field with them. I am sure they will give me the same service in the Flint Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma that my old ones have done. For anyone who has not used trekking poles before, be sure and do your homework."
3,Mithun Disco Dancer,"This was Mithun's debut film. He became famous for the song ""I am a Disco Dancer"".The movie has a decent story but good music by Bappi Lahiri"
1,Horrifying,"This kind of ""realisitc"" advice for the workplace has not been assembled in one location before-- because few thoughtful people wanted to wallow in the psychic cesspool of the corporate workplace. This book is filled with information on what to avoid-- if you expect to keep your sanity and stay human.On the other hand, if you want to trade your soul for a parking space and a corner cubicle, buy it."
5,I have always loved The Weavers - did back when they were 'Big' and still do.,Wasn't That a Time - The Best of the Weavers - We sang their songs when I was in college and on through the 60s and some of the 70s. They got a raw deal and were unjustly 'blacklisted' which essentially killed their careers. So unfair - but I still remember and sing along with them.
3,The Early Weavers,The early Weavers sung some strange songs and this album probably has a lot of them. I probably should have selected the mid years in folk singing.
2,Poor audio quality,"In addition to the poor audio quality, I hadn't remembered the Weavers sounding so syrupy."
1,Don't fit,I went out to place these on and found they don't fit the OE mirrors I have. They are for a 90 Dodge W-250 and do not work. Your better off to buy this at a local store to make sure it fits. They are worthless as they are to me.
5,EXCELENTE ARTICULO!!!!!,"EXCELENTE ARTICULO,,, FACIL INSTALACION!!!!EN GENERAL MUY BUENA COMPRA!!!!! AL COLOCARLOS, LA VISIBILIDAD ES MUY AMPLIA,, SE DETALLA (EN MI CASO) PERFECTAMENTE EL TRAILER DE LA LANCHA QUE LLEVO.."
1,Not what I ordered.,"I did not receive the pad in the picture. I got one that was straight as opposed to one that is slightly curved, which I wanted. The strap bunches up where a curve would have been very useful. Also, the one I got has rows and columns of little pads instead of one row of longer pads. Not too sure what the difference would have been. I'm not really happy with it. But it feels better than just a strap by itself."
4,great for me!,"this one i got does have the velcro attachment which i actually don't like...because i'm using it to carry a heavy camera bag- and i can hear the velcro opening up a bit. But i LOVE the gel, feels really comfortable. Haven't used it for a shoot yet (came one day too late for that) but when I do, i'll try to comment back. Either way, great price!"
1,False Representation,"I needed a strap for my carry on bag because it sadly does not have sufficent padding. I went with this strap because it looked very supportive and comfortable. Before purchasing it I looked everywhere online to see if this strap had a velcro opening or not. Even though it is intended for guitars I believe I came across some online reviews where people were also using it for bags, etc. I finally found another website which showed in pictures how this strap does indeed have a velcro opening.Well, it actually doesn't. And I bought this from a third party Amazon seller and couldn't easily get my $$$ back. So beware."
2,"Don't shoot down the game,shoot down the system","OK a lot of comments are saying this game sucks well on the playstation it does, but glover when it was released on the nintendo 64 a year earlier is awesome...buy that one dont waste your money on this crappy playstation game...and remember its not the game its the system!"
4,One minor complaint,"The book was excellent. I am a left brain type who likes to read through each bit and I found the explanation was simple but very effective. The hundreds of tips alone made it worth the money. So the one complaint .... ?I am a Maths teacher and use the Equation Editor as much as any other feature - it gets ONE mention in the 756 pages and that is just to refer to the fact that there is an editing mode called ""Equation Editor"".OK maybe Laura and Read don't have much need for writing equations but they might have found someone who does. Actually I have been using the Equation Editor for years and thought I knew everything there was to know but version 10 has some differences and I had hoped the book would help point them out. I guess I'll have to find out the hard way, again."
2,Disappointing,"Let me preface this review: I love A&C; movies. Love them. So why the bad review?The quality of this dvd is poor. There is little enhancement to the audio or visual aspects, but, mostly, the description of this dvd is misleading.This special was merely the Christmas timed version of the Colgate Comedy Hour. Not all the skits are A & C and those that are aren't all that holiday centric. In fact, most have no reference to hte holidays. The music aspects of this ""special"" aren't holiday based either.I don't have much to reference, but I would have expected something much more of the content revolved around Christmas if it was truly a Christmas Special.In my opinion, it wasn't even worth the $2 I spent for it, as I will never watch it again."
4,another wrong item,"The product i purchased and received was once again the wrong item from what was shown in the picture. However the item I did receive is a very good hatchet. I received the kindling axe from the gift set witch is silver instead of black as shown on the picture. Also the sheath was the smaller one that only covers the blade as shown in the gift set. I was expecting the full sheath like shown on the picture of the item that i was supposed to receive. Now enough about the complaints that will most likely will go unnoticed. The kindling axe is superior to any axe I've purchased before, I strongly recommend this axe to anyone who would use it for camping, throwing, and all around chopping."
1,I paid for this!?,"I was unaware of Milla unauthorizing this material when I bought it. I was once again swindled out of my money. I love The Divine Comedy, but this is nothing less than a horrible exploitation of Milla. The tracks are something different, if that is what you're looking for. They are not, however, what I was looking for or expecting to hear. I can't tell the difference between many of these tracks. All they are is a bunch of strange rythms (if you would even call them rythms) with Milla's voice added into them and repeated until you want to scream at whoever produced it and punch them in the armpit. If you're a Milla fan, don't buy it. You'd just be giving money to some selfish sons of motherless goats. Also, the music doesn't sound anything like what Milla would produce. If you're into this kind of music, I guess you can go ahead, but i don't approve."
1,ptoooey!,Mila? What Mila? Crappy music by a crappy band that uses I don't know what from Mila to market it's awful album. If you liked Divine Comedy you will HATE this. I wish Mila would release another album but this one just won't do.
4,Purchased as a Gift,"I have a friend that lives in France, who really wanted this CD, so I bought it for her as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. She was thrilled at my thoughtfulness, as well as this CD. She said that it was a good CD."
3,Umm...,"I threw this CD out because I just couldn't stand it anymore. It's a fascinating novelty but it doesn't take long before it starts to sound like a modem dial. Milla really sounds like $h!t on this CD. She doesn't really sing, she just mumbles and whinges. The 'music' itself is very interesting, very low-key slurring droning and morbid. This is the perfect CD for getting stoned to or for when you can't sleep. It buzzes, fuzzes and makes you sleepy - otherwise it sounds like a cat caught in a dishwasher. This is the sorta thing Sarah Mclachlan might be doing when she's 90."
3,Good in a bad way,"I'm 16 years old, and my school is often compared to Columbine High. I think it's extremely sad that there are so many kids my age out there committing crimes, that an author is able to put together a 500 page book on juvenile crimes. But overall, the book is good if you're into crime solving and detective work."
5,Up and Down California 1860-1864,Excellent history lesson about areas of early California. Sometimes a little difficult to understand where he is but still a great book
4,TRACKS,"DISC ONE: DUPREE'S DIAMOND BLUES, MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON, CHINA CAT SUNFLOWER, DOIN' THAT RAG, CRYPTICAL ENVELOPMENT, THE OTHER ONE, THE ELEVEN, THE OTHER ONE, I KNOW IT'S A SIN, TURN ON YOUR LOVELIGHT, ME & MY UNCLE, SITTIN' ON TOP OF THE WORLD. DISC TWO: DARK STAR, ST. STEPHEN, THE ELEVEN, TURN ON YOUR LOVELIGHT, MORNING DEW."
4,Works with Cisco IP Phones!!!!,"Great switch for the price. The interface for doing vLANs could use some work but I bought them mainly for the POE compatability with Cisco 7940 and 7960 IP Phones. While the cheaper Netgear switches with POE do NOT support these phones, this one does!!!! Beats paying $3000 for a Cisco. If you want to do hard core vLANing though I would stick with Cisco."
2,Toy Fun-Quality no good,"My son has one of these and in two weeks we have used 2 brand new batteries and they are both now dead. He loves to play with this toy, but we can't afford a new $6 battery ever week for a toy"
4,"Generally great, but missing info","This is a reproduction of highly detailed shop manuals used by a top gunsmith company. In the exploded gun drawings, the various items are numbered, but the description is not provided as a table linking the numbers, which I'm sure were included in the original loose leaf manuals. Most components are obvious (trigger, barrel etc) but some are not, at least to an amateur. This is not a cheap manuscript, so would expect this level of detail. I used another pub, the Gun Digest book of Firearms Assembly/disassembly to correlate descriptions"
1,Don't buy anything from here,"I bought a book from this business, under the impression that it was a new book. For $54.00, a 155 page, paperback book, it should be a new one. The book I recieved was a horribly used book with writing on the cover and throughout the book. I emeilaed the seller asking to return the book and here's his reply:Ha ha ha, that is a good one. We don't sell new books. In fact, your book was listed in the worst possible used category, ""acceptable.""So I'll personally will never buy from him again and am seriously thinking maybe Amazon isn't a really good place to purchase things. Omce bitten, twice shy sort of feeling. I also while waiting to hear back from the seller, found the exact book at Midway.com for $24.00 and it's NEW!! So the laughs on me this time. Do Not buy from the seller is my advice."
3,Fun to play,"This game is fun to play, but could be upgraded with some changes. You cannot see the whole board while playing. This can get very frustrating when you start to get words away from the center of the board. Has some nice features with hints and dictionary."
1,Want my money back,"Hi,I bought and returned this because what I wanted was not the play station but a cd that could be played on the computer. I therefore returned it over 4 weeks or more ago, but have not got my omney back. Can you please help make sure I do get my money back"
4,Looking For Scrabble...,I used to have this game and it's helped me improve my vocabulary. I see some people don't like it because of Maven. I enjoy it alot because I can play someone without anyone actually being there at one level or another. I also enjoy it because I can compete with friends or family. It's a wonderful family game.
1,Glitchy and plain awful,"I didnt buy this game from this seller but i thought i would do you a solid and tell you not to waste your money on this. This game is cheap, poor quality, and glitchy. I was playing a two-player game (me against my friend) and it wouldnt except certain words like ""net"" and ""web"". The game said ""the words are not in the scrabble dictionary"" or something along those lines. What the heck? How does that even happen? Anyway, do not waste your money on this, i got mine for 3 bucks at goodwill and i still feel ripped off."
4,Days Go By itself is a 5 star tune,"So what if Dirty Vegas is a certified 1 Hit Wonder? Better to be 1 than a No Hit Blunder. 'Days Go By' still sounds fresh, hypnotic and as compelling as ever more than 2 years since we all first heard it on that Mitsubishi car commercial.I wager that it will still sound the same way 2 years and more from now. Catch the video if you can track it down too.And no, the Acoustic Mix (which sounds like the demo) is rather pedestrian. The other mixes are anything but."
1,Inadequate,"This book consits of explanations of diagrams. It is repetitive, boring and monotonous. In large part, the book focuses on the various ways that a circuit using a relay can be constructed, without ever explaining how all of this fits into the working of a computer."
1,Terrible Book,"Maybe I missed something two of the other reviewers didn't, but for me this book is plain awful. The diagrams look as though they have been freehand drawn, nothing seems to be clearly explained, in short I can't comprehend anything from this book."
1,Choose Levine,"The book shipped quickly and was received in great shape; however, the author does not clarify several topics and ideas for this very complex subject (the read almost seems childish- too dumbed down). I recommend Ira N. Levine for any textbooks pertaining to Physical Chemistry. Mr. Levine takes the extra step and provides examples with every topic being fully explained and when needed- to great detail. Go out and use Levine as your go-to guy for help on this subject, I promise he is the best and I am speaking from personal experience of being a student of PCHEM."
1,doesnt help much,"This book truely does not help much. The problems at the end of the chapters do not have any answers in the back of the book, as do all others. It is impossible to check your work until it is too late. This book does not build from simpler to more complex. It does the opposite, which only prolongs the learning process and makes it more difficult than it could be."
1,Get out my face with this Perfect weapon,"the fighting is kinda kool,Graphics are sorta tight,sorry camera angles make you want to quit.the sound [stinks]!When you're fighting the camera angles is like too far away,please don't get me started with the guy jumping.please i saw a better jump in the XFL rating's then this guy.then you fight these dog's/wolves or whatever,its hard to hit them.the controls are sad! the game just blows. i would give it five stars if the game cost like 2 dollars and free shipping and handling. this game should be call the Perfect ...."
5,"Awesome game, fast shipping!","This product came days before it said it would, so that was a plus! never having played this game before i didn't know what to expect but it was really fun. definitely would recommend."
1,horrible,i remember buying this game so many years back thinking that it looked so cool. wow was i wrong. this game is so bad that it should probably be bought for that reason. kinda like movies that are so bad you have to own them.
1,Auto Vent Shade,"Auto Ventshade 94124 Ventvisor 4-Piece Smoke Window VisorThe product was suppose to fit my 1995 Volvo, but did not even though it said on the web site it did. I requested another one as a replacement. I was sent the same thing! Needless to say I was not very happy.B. Clark"
3,"of course nice, but why the price is so ridiculous?","Could someone explain this to me? Yes it is good, but what's so special to make it so much more expensive than the other classics?"
5,A source of inspiration,"This is an extraordinary book, a great example of Feynman's intense originality. Of course he put quantum mechanics upside down, with his path integrals (you DERIVE Schroedinger's equation!), and this is extremely enlightening. But that is not the whole story. The book is full of profound insight on practically anything, even elementary matters, such as the consideration of continuous spectra and the role of mathematics in physics. The idea of summing over histories propagates from quantum dynamics to everything in sight, leaving no stone unturned. One of the most important books on science, ever. Very readable!"
5,Metal Cowboy: Tales from the Road Less Pedaled,"Joe Kurmaskie is a story teller for today! He combines the wit, wisdom and sensitivity of Sam Clemens, Will Rodgers, and John Gierach. this book will give you ""itchy feet"" whether you are a bicyclist or not, you'll want to get aout on the open road and feel the freedom.Thanks Joe for the wonderful yarns!"
4,3 Stars For The Book + 1 Star For The Ride,"For anyone who has hit the road, trail, path or sidewalk on a bike there is a certain appreciation for the freedom and solitude that these rides bring. Joe Kurmaksie in ""Metal Cowboy"" does an excellent bit of story-telling more in the Bryson vein than the 5-star classic travel book William Least Heat Moon's ""Blue Highways"". If you have ever experienced the ups and downs of long-distance riding, you will enjoy this book."
3,Short stories about cycling around the world,"A good, lighthearted first person account of the author's extended bicycle touring trips around the world. I read this book while planning a bicycle trip across America, and was hoping to gain nuggets of wisdom for my own trip. This book really didn't deliver in that regard, but it was an enjoyable read nonetheless.The author appears to be a magazine and newspaper columnist, and this shows in the book, which is a collection of short (mostly unrelated) stories. The stories are well written, succinct, humorous, and broken into easily digestible chunks. The unifying thread is really the quest to explore the world ""out there"", and the author succeeds in instilling a fire in your belly to go out and see what's out there. If you go, it will be cool."
2,"I really wanted to like this book, but...","Joe Kurmaskie has written a travelogue/ slices of life book based on several cross country bicycle trips (and one to Australia). The stories are pretty engaging and optimistic, and the author has obviously worked hard in an attempt to be entertaining.I am a bicyclist who has done some touring, so there were a lot of reasons why I really wanted to like this book. But there is so much hokiness, bragging, and pseudo-philosophizing in these stories that I could only read it in small doses.Kurmaskie has talent as a writer. I guess it seemed to me that instead of being content with his small stories he tried to make them big, huge, epic, deep. But he overinflated his mental tube. The result- a blowout at 30mph. He overreaches so much he sounds silly instead of profound."
4,an excellent book...,"This is the book that I reccomended to family members who just didnt ""get"" why I wanted to ride my bike across the country. He is witty and inciteful, with lots of great stories that only years of riding around on a bike could bring.The only thing that I didnt like about the book is the ""how I learned to love bikes"" part. It seems that any book about cycling (around the world by bike, spokesongs, ... ...) has an intro like this and they are all pretty much the same. But I guess the give perspective to people who dont live for riding."
5,Stories about life,It's more a book about why we cycle than cycling. Great series of short stories about a young man's exposure to the best and worst of the human race. From love stories to male bonding to the ultimate practical joke in `a friendly game of darts'. This is a must read book for anyone who identifies with the freedom of `life on the road.'.
4,Wow!!!!Headache....,This book is excellent on showing how countries and states where influenced by each other. The only problem I had with it was it was a college level book and I am still in high-school. So i did have to go back and reread paragraphs every so often. But this book asks many important questions and gives great insight on how and why the different world cultures spread.
2,Complexity tackled through simplification,"Tackling a multi-level complex phenomenon that is culture through simplification based on questionable material reconfirms the cold war mentality which is highly representative for the time the data was gathered. However, for those who look for a quick fix based on stereotyping, this is the literature to read."
2,dated curiosity,"If you like the early, shinybubbly moog synth sound, you might like this. Don't expect any masterful compositions, however: tracks like Elephant... and Puppet... trade on the novelty of the sounds rather than any satisfying compositional quality. And the absurdity of Hello Dolly and Bumblebee is good for only a single hearing; even the classic EVA wears out its welcome fairly quickly. If you're really keen on Perrey check out the Best Of available on import from the UK (it also includes a Fatboy Slim remix and dub of EVA)."
5,Great Music,This is an excellent CD for the holiday season! Sound quality is great and these versions of the holiday classics are outstanding.
2,Too small,"This ball is not what I expected. It is TINY. My dog has had the larger version of this ball and I wanted to replace it, so I ordered this. I expected it to be the same size, about a baseball, but what came was more like a golf ball. I can see how this size is well suited to birds, but it is certainly not appropriate for any but the tiniest dogs."
1,Crashes constantly,"This is a huge step back for Apple's iApps, particularly iPhoto, which is an absolute disaster in this release. We typically cannot launch iPhoto without crashing unless we trash three catalog files. Importing more than once a day is impossible - the app says it cannot access .../iPhoto Library/month/date the second time you try to import.Add to that the continued game of keep-away with iDVD, which will not work with external DVD burners. If you bought anything less than the highest-end Macs, or models like the Cube or iBook that have never had built-in DVD burners as an option, well, too darn bad! Kind of obviates the coolness of FireWire when peripherals are deliberately not supported by Apple.Crashing and losing user data is NEVER acceptable. Apple, more than anyone, is supposed to know this. The company should be absolutely ashamed of this pathetic product, and should not offer it for sale until they work out the bugs and stop being such jerks about DVD burning."
2,great product but lousy license,"The the 10.3 Family Pack and the iLife Family Pack license have exactly the same language -""as long as those computers are located in the same household and used by persons who occupy that same household"".For those who respect intellectual property and read their licenses carefully, this means that the 10.3 Family Pack cannot be installed on a Powerbook which then is taken outside the same household nor on another Mac located at another of your personal residences. Apple has confirmed that this is the correct interpretation of their license language.All Apple had to do with both Family Pack licenses is change ""located in the same household and used by"" to""located in the same household OR used by"".Unfortunately the lawyers cannot seem to agree with that simple change so don't waste your money on the Family Pack unless you can comply with the license or choose to ignore it."
2,Superb product but lousy license,"The iLife Family Pack license has exactly the same language as the Panther family pack -""as long as those computers are located in the same household and used by persons who occupy that same household"".For those who respect intellectual property and read their licenses carefully, this means that the Family Pack iLife cannot be installed on a Powerbook which then is taken outside the same household nor on another Mac located at another of your personal residences. Apple has confirmed that this is the correct interpretation of their license language.All Apple had to do with both Family Pack licenses is change""located in the same household and used by"" to""located in the same household OR used by"".Unfortunately the lawyers cannot seem to agree with that simple change so don't waste your money on the Family Pack unless you can comply with the license or choose to ignore it."
5,Bratz Shelf,This shelf goes perfectly with all the other Bratz items that I purchased for my daughters bedroom. She loves her Bratz bedroom.
1,How could they do this to a classic game?,"Pong was one of the greatest and most addicting game of its time. It still is. And here comes Hasbro, thinking they're ""oh so cool"" to have the honor to update the game for a 90s style version. THIS is what they came up with? What an insult to the original play of the beautiful game that was such a landmark in every way. This is pitiful gaming at its worse. (No, actually its a decent game... go figure)"
5,Spirituality,"This is an amazing book in it ability to provide modern day interpretation to the St. Benedict's teachings. The insights of this saint who lived in the 6th century contain uncanny wisdom and direction for us today, whether as religious, lay person, for family and business leaders. Ms de Waal's style is thoughtful, prayerful, inspiring.I recommend it to anyone who is interested in personal, and/or societel growth."
5,Fabulous,There is a difference between the male and female brain...Fascinating study that helps me appreciate the difference.
2,"Blum's ""Sex on the Brain"" far superior","Deborah Blum's ""Sex on the Brain"" and LeVay's ""The Sexual Brain"" are both far superior discussions on the topic -- and both much more current. They lack the arrogant tone, bizarre notions about feminism, and denial of the great variations within the sexes that this tired little tome does. There are differences between the sexes, but there are also great differences between each woman and each man. There is a review on epinions.com that covers these points in more detail."
3,hibnec,"More of a POP-Culture style book than a real scientific investigation book. The authors feel that biological forces are the only things affecting the differences between men and women, not social or environmental forces. I found this view to be too isolating for such a complex subject."
1,Brain Hexing,"As states in the book...if a male brain can reside in the body of a female..and a female brain in the body of a male...than my logical conclusion is that it is not gender which dictates ability but individual differences amoung all humans....the book has an agenda... ...the book is sujective...never really acknowlegding individual variations.... ..the book unfortunately has been believed as fact...people buy into what they read without really thinking about it...some people regardless of gender have spatial brains and some have verbal...emotional brains...from personal experience..I'm a wiz in math and couldn't act in a play if I had a gun to my head...so I must have a male brain in a female body ...right... enough...grin and buy it,read it then burn it in the nearest incinerator."
1,Starting off with a falsehood,"I believe that when a book is written with the purpose of informing and creating scientific discussion, the book had better present facts and scientific proof to back up the statement which it puts forth.I picked up this book with eager excitement of delving more into the differences of men and women and understanding them. However, around page 15 there was such a large historical error that taking the rest of the book seriously was completely gone.The authors wrote that Columbus discovered America. This is known to be false. Columbus did not discover America as Native Americans were already living on this continent as every person knows. To not clarify or change that statement in the book makes all other given information questionable. If the authors can't get the facts of history correct, then how can we be expected to trust in the rest of the book.Needless to say, I put the book away."
5,Awesome. Helped me understand variations of masculinity.,This book was an eye opener. It helped me understand possible reasons for the wide variations of masculinity and femininity. It is absolutely fantastic.
3,Offended,I was simply reading part of the book that was offered free online and became very offended.I get that women and men have different strengths and weaknesses but to say women are less intelligent than men is insulting and untrue. In most of my honors class in high school i found that there were more girls than boys. So how does that fit in with so called science?
2,New justification for old prejudice,"Annie Moir, with whatever input by David Jessel recycles all the usual anti-men prejudice and stereotypes in a new package with new ""scientific"" justifications. Whether it's families or jobs or relationships, they never seem to get past a paragraph without inserting a gratuitous men bashing comment. Often the men bashing goes on for many paragraphs in a row, and usually shows almost no actual knowledge of men. They use recent research on brain physiology to ""prove"" their two theses, 1) men are bad, and 2) women belong in the kitchen with the kids. Men will find the first thesis galling and hateful all the way through. Feminists who think women don't belong in the kitchen will find much of the book equally abhorrent."
1,What nonsense this book is,"This book is drivel. I have done my own share of research in medical libraries, and my findings do not match those of this book. I can't even believe it got published and that people continue to buy into these hackneyed theories. Probably the same people who believe men are from mars and women are from venus. One does not have to be a genius to figure out that male and female role playing has evolved throughout the ages to the mess we live with now. People are people, and it would benefit society greatly if the similarities between the sexes were celebrated, instead of the ""differences"" emphasized. Testosterone and estrogen are both gonadal hormones, similar in function-and both sexes produce both hormones. I suggest reading ""The Biology of Women"" by Ethel Sloane-she states that ""...no measured behavior or ability has as yet been found to be unique to either males or females."" and that there are more differences found inside the sexes themselves than between them."
2,Excellenttt,"I just yesterday used in my dear little shitzu doggy excellent product the comb slide softly and easy in its hair when I bathed it, very good and smell so good!!!"
5,sammy the seal,what happens when sammy the adventrous seal leaves the zoo for a day? he goes to the city finds a school full of kids and new things to do and he even learns to read.
1,Very unreliable,"I have had a Liberty Plus for several years. As mentioned by another reviewer, when it works it is fine. However, it is very unreliable, sometimes starting without problem after changing the gas and other times not working (the dreaded slow red flash!). I recently sent it back for service at great expense but again it did not work after just one changing of gas. Surely there must be a better product on the market than this?"
1,Piece of junk,"The Liberty Plus is one of the worst investments I ever made. It worked fine for the first 3 months and then it never worked right again. I even paid $57.00 shipping so I could send to a repair shop and they sent it back saying there was nothing wrong with it. well, it still never worked properly, it worked sometimes. Dealing with Woodstream was not pleasant either they didn't want to do anything for me. It is a great product when it is working though. I have spoken with retailers and they said they have stopped carrying the Mosquito Magnet because their customers have had nothing but problems with this item. wouldn't give it any stars but I am required to give at least one to submit this review."
2,"Every year, needs some expensive new part...very unreliable","We have owned a Liberty Plus for two years. After year one, it needed a new thermistor part - and they wanted to charge something like $150 to install a $20 part with 15 minutes of labor. Only after a lot of arguing did I get it replaced under warranty. This year, the rechargable battery seems to be kaput. Another expensive part ($65 on the company's web site). And it's only marginally effective when it IS running right. Nice idea, poor realization."
2,PURE JUNK,All you have is small straws and a spray nozzle. The hand sprayer these straws fit worked one time and quit.
3,Not sure if it did anything,"We bought these as a recommendation from my dad and stepmom who are very involved with homeopathic medicines. We were trying to slow the growth of an inoperable facial tumor in our beloved dog, but we don't know if it was too late or if the product didn't work. The tumor grew exceptionally fast and we had to put her down this week. We had been using the product for about 2 mos. but it was difficult to get an exact dosage for her."
1,If your looking for a good fishing game look elsewhere,"Fishing games back in the day, really did not offer much of anything other then wasted cash and this game was no exception. fishing is unrealistic, can only catch a few types of fishes and playing controls do not work the way they should. avoid this game and spend your money on something else. 1 star."
1,Poor Quality,"Within minutes (yes minutes) of having balloon filled, it popped. It was going to be the focal point of my daugher's birhtday party, but unfortunately it didn't even make it back to my home. What a let down. And it was the quality of the balloon, because the seam was broken on the under side. Will not order from this vendor again."
5,"All you old Detroit Rock and Rollers, Frost Lives!","Growing up in Detroit in the late 60s, Frost was my favorite band among all the other great bands: MC5, Amboy Dukes, Savage Grace, Seeger, SRC, etc. I saw Frost at least a dozen times and considered them the most exciting Michiagn bands, although MC5 was often amazing also. I understand Dick Wagner is back in Saginaw working to help local bands develop. The 3 Frost alblums available on Amazon are a godsend for us old farts whose records have been through waterbed floods, spilled beer and many years of playing. Great music that holds up over the years!"
2,should be called home daydreamer rather than designer,"i purchased this product with the intention of designing a small home for myself. while the 3d views are helpful visualization tools this program seems best suited to design of the ""what would my living room look like painted green"" or ""what would the front yard look like with some juniper"" variety. sure there are some cool features, but in the end you can't produce a plan to work off of or modify the framing to suit specific design needs. the most obvious drawback for me was the inability to easily modify wall height for a simple one and a half story structure. that said, the dimensioning and the library of common household objects help to plan space usage. however, if you want to do anything besides computer assisted daydreaming you'll probably want to kick down the cash for pro, since it supposedly allows you to manually edit framing and produce dimensioned blue prints."
4,takes time to learn,Really neat program and it may be a tad over my head right now. The tutorial is helping a great deal. I am positive that I will find all the right buttons.
2,Same clunky interface as always,"I have been using Home Design software off and on for the last ten years, and was dissapointed when I bought Home Designer Deluxe, and its usability was little improved over the first product I used years ago. Sure, there are loads of new features, but the feel of the program still seems clunky, slow, and unintuitive to me. It may be great for somebody who is willing to immerse themselves in this software and learn every detail, but it is very difficult for a casual user to use very many of the features."
2,Over Priced...!!!!!!??,"Not all that much. Lacks some basic features like varying wall heights and the Terrain functions not user friendly. Like I said...for what you get...to much $$$.It can be fun to use, but for anyone seriously looking for a House ""PLANNING"" program...keep looking. You will most likely pay mnore for a good tool, but you know/knew that anyways...;)btw...To qualify my opinion/rating:I have combined experience in Carpentry of 30 years and Software QA Engineering for 12 years."
4,Very Pleased,"I think this product is great! I don't know any ""technical"" lingo when it comes to architecture so I was a true novice. I could still navigate the program and, thanks to the tutorials, I managed to find my way around the program and learned how to use the tools. I was interested in a remodel to our current house and had no idea of what I wanted for sure and how it would work and look with our current house plan. This program enabled me to do this work on my own without hiring it done and I was able to make decisions and change that decision and then change that decision again! I do wish it had a few more options that I was looking for, and maybe it does and I haven't stumbled across them yet. It does the job -- it gives me the basic house plan to take to the contractor and they can give it the fine tuning it needs."
1,Bored now...,"OK, this really wasn't what I expected. My wife and I were laughing almost at once (and not in a good way). The questions are just too easy and the ""board-game"" aspect is just too weak. We even tried to just concentrate on the questions without the board; they were just too easy. I don't think we had one in over 20 attempts that took more than 5 clues (out of 20) to correctly guess.Unless you are easily entertained, you are not likely to enjoy this game for long..."
5,21st Century 20 Questions Review,This game is incredibly wonderful!!! Take my word for it- this incredibly great game would make a wonderful birthday present!!! I also reccomend (if you like books) the Time Warp Trio books by Jon Scieszka- there are the best books EVER!!! THANK YOU!!! (...)Heaven is niceRachel M. is too
5,OH...MY...GOD...,"Oh my God, this is one of the best games I have ever played in my life. I am a huge fan of horror movies and games, and this really impressed me. I am also a huge fan of The Clock Tower Trilogy(check out my reviews of Clcok Tower 2 and 3), so this is awesome.Final Grade:10 out of 10- BUY IT, OR ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!Buy or rent: BUY IT, OR ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!NOTE: BUY IT, OR ELSE!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the most scariest games ever!,Ok i played this game in 1998 it freak me out !!!you have to get this game ! but it`s rare nowadays .........there is a lot of surprises in tthis game like when the scissorman pops out of no where ......and that creepy music ! my fav characters are jeniffer and helen...........................you need to use a mouse to move ever where ....... i played clock tower 2 which really sucked ! part 1 was a lot better than 2 ! tell you what ? GET THE GAME NOW!
5,Well Done Tina,"Being her fan for more than 14 years, I still think she is one of the best singer from DownUnder. This is defintely one of her best track from her new album. The remixes here are real well done. Eurobeat is more than 6 minutes and it is fabulous!Beautiful song. You'll love it. Will implant in your mind."
1,if people cannot understand it....you have wasted your time,"The book is a collection of essays on gender issues. As a history graduate student I really have problem with reading history written by anyone other than historians. Most of the essays were written by English professors who string a series of exquisite words together leading many to utter confusion. I did not like any of the essays, and most of it can be quite confusing if not far fetched. I am not a gender historian, but some of the ideas remind me of 3rd century Gnostic writers. If your into gender history, give it a shot."
5,Love it!,DJ Shadow's second album Preemptive Strike is the best after Endtroducing. It is the true spiritual successor to endtroducing and features the same great atmosphere that make shadow's sampling skills a legend. Album cover features beautiful art that is great for displaying.
4,Prepare for Departure,"I bought this album after investing in ""Introducing.."" Preemptive Strike is one of those albums that grows on you after several complete listening sessions. Some friends and I left it on at a party, it wasn't until later on when people started noticing the funky cuts and samples that blasted from the other room. After awhile, everyone was paying close attention and trying to take in every beat. A must for any serious music lover."
3,PREMPTIVE STRIKE IS DECENT BUT YOU MIGHT FALL ASLEEP,WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO THIS DISK I HATED IT. THIS IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO MY PREFERENCES TOWARDS JUNGLE AND HARDCORE. AFTER LISTENING A COUPLE TIMES IT GREW ON ME. SHADOW'S SCRATCHING ABILITY IS JUST A SHADE UNDER QBERT'S OR MIX MASTER MIKE. WHILE THIS ALBUM COULD BORE YOU TO DEATH IT CAN PUT YOU IN A TRANCE AS WELL.ALTHOUGH THAT CAN BE A VERY THIN LINE.
4,"Brash, Raw,So many Influences - Brilliant !",Preemptive Strike takes you through so many thoughts and feelings that it could leave you feeling a little confused. Just lie back and listed and pretty soon you will feel yourself becoming totally absorbed. DJ Shadow uses his unique style to bring together a totally new brand of music. This CD is definetly neo-classical and I am sure if Mozart were alive today he would approve. Just open your mind and listen.
4,Awesome videos,My boys (2 and 4) love this DVD. The footage is current and well put together. The commentary is a little cheesy but the kids don't mind so that is fine with me.
3,"Fun, informative, but too long","My son likes the names of all the machines and the noises they make, he loves all the machinery and construction trucks so this video is good for that. But it is too long, gets boring, kinda drags on instead of keeping kids interest. My son still loves it and it was a good price, under $10, so I still think it is a OK video.It does have some different machines then what we saw before so my son liked that.The ""Onsite Bob the Builder"" videos are made way better and more fun, educational. We have 3 of those. But for under $10, this video is still a good buy."
1,Supposed to be About WEATHER,"Big Weather? WRONG!!!! This guy covers philosophy, map making,religion, his philosophical ideas to the point of nausea, old world history, pages & pages about Mary MacLane, oh yeah, and almost as an afterthought there are some pages about weather & chasing. But still laced with his philosophy.NOT a book for anyone except maybe self styled ""intellectuals"""
1,Mean spirited and misleading,"Books of this nature are best written by experts in their own fields. The author is not an expert tornado-chaser. After spending a week or so ""chasing"", he thinks he has captured the true essence of tornado chasing? I think not. This might have been an intriguing book, but the author's mean-spirited nature in certain parts stained the book into a self-serving failure. (As witnessed in discount bins and used book offers). Since this is only the author's second attempt at literature, I guess some forgiveness is in order. I personally did not like this book and cannot honestly recommend it to anyone other than reviewers who know nothing about tornado-chasing and can be easily mislead."
1,Author should have done a bit better in his research,"I find hard to take anything in this book seriously when the author couldn't be bothered to do any research but instead took the word of folks who's backgrounds are questionable.When an author does no background checks and lends credibility to a chaser that has been arrested numerous times in his ""19 years"" of chasing for things such as burglery, grand theft auto, resisting arrest, public intoxication and allows him to slander others without getting the other side of the story it really takes the credibility away from the author and the book.Honestly this depicts the chasing community in a inaccurate manor and I'd highly recommend bypassing it."
2,Fact-checking? Ever heard of it?,"Recently checked this out from my library... I have to ask if the author or the publisher did any proofing or fact-checking? The Palm Sunday Super Outbreak of 1974? Pretty sure those were two seperate outbreaks... Sixteen F5's in Kansas since 1950? Not even close! Kobe Bryant's winning shot vs San Antonio...no, that was Derek Fisher who hit that shot.While some my enjoy his lengthy philosophical ramblings, I do not... this book could be cut in half, and easily! By the third or fourth chapter I just began skipping the paragraphs and pages that had nothing to do with storm chasing.That's not to say the book is a total dud, there are good sections and vivid descriptions of people and storms for sure, but it's too long-winded and inaccurate to give anything more than two stars."
1,"Big Weather, Big Disappointment","I am fortunate in that I did not actually spend money on this book. I do not know about the poetic aspects of the book, but I do know that the author treated many of the people in this book insultingly. I skipped around a bit thinking that perhaps only the beginning would be colored by condescension but remained disappointed. If you want a good book that exposes the relationships between big weather and the people who live through it read F5 by Mark Levine. If you want a good book about big weather read any book other than the one this review is about."
5,Great Weather: Big Picture,"I picked this book up, having enjoyed Svenvold's first nonfiction title, Elmer McCurdy. I expected more of his wide ranging reflection on the peculiarities of American culture, and I was not disappointed. Here again Svenvold shows not only that he is an excellent, inventive, amusing and serious writer, but also that he knows how fit the small strange peices of the American puzzle into the big picture. The author is quite well-read, and he uses what he has read in the service of that big picture. He's also good at the thumbnail sketch, in which he catches of many of the chasers in amusing and sometimes unflattering light. There's more here to laugh outloud at and to reflect seriously on than in your typical summer reading. This is a great book that anyone interested in our rapidly changing climate needs to read. I was on Zacynthos in the Ionian Sea when I finished it, and I did not want it to end."
1,Not a very good book for a beginner or expert,"This book is filled with coding examples that do not show the reader how to use the power of Delphi. To use Delphi's power and ease of use, you should use Delphi's components, not write a lot of obscure pascal code. I'm sorry to say that this book is not very useful in teaching a newcomer how to use Delphi, and it it not useful at all for the experienced programmer."
2,The highest of the highest,"Shlomo has become the heart and soul of Jewish music, even in the synagogue. His melodies are now 'davvaned' in places which once cursed him.He was without question a musical genius whose depth of soul is reflected in every note and word he sings. In this early music one can already hear that longing, that love which so touches the listener. His voice is not great, but the feeling it conveys goes well beyond what is ordinarily given in most singing. He has the holy in him, the nearness to and longing for G-d. And he conveys that to us, so sweetly, so beautifully.Oy heilegen Shlomo what would we do without your music?"
2,Winnie The Pooh T.V.,My daughter loved the Winnie the Pooh T.V. but the bulb to wind up the toy kept breaking. My daughter was only 6 months old when she had it so she was just looking at the T.V. I was the one winding it up. We had two of these T.V.'s and both were the same.
3,five second attention getter,"This toy was indeed durable, and a little dangerous for smaller children due to the durability however, very colorful. My daughter at 8 months enjoyed it for a short period, and currently it is not her pick of the litter at 1 year."
2,"Often Features Unuseful, Unattractive Art Projects","I wanted to like this magazine as we are a creative family with a big shop and open to new ideas. Their featured projects, however, are rarely of interest to me and the finished products are items you couldn't give to me."
2,Maybe good for teachers?,"The projects in this magazine remind me of something you would do in an art class in elementary school. They may be fun projects but not really something you want to display in your house.Also, I am a little flustered that with the first issue I received a note that said my subscription was ending. I have only received 3 issues in 6 months. I feel like I am being had."
3,maybe for someone else,"I like the idea of this magazine and am sure that many others find it useful.For me, most of the projects are over my head or use tools I don't have or are for things that I just would never use.I enjoy about 30% of the content."
2,Very inane ideas but good photography,"The ideas indicate a real paucity if ""good"" solutions. The magazine is great in color, layout and explanation, but the ideas go from ""cheezy to poor""The best asset of the magazine is the photography and ""other materials"". It is apparent that the creative juices are over wrought. Practical solutions to everyday problems are rarely workable or something a person could live with.My wife ordered this for me because I had taken it for a year. I wish she had not. The magazine is expensive for what you get and if you get a good idea an issue - you have struck gold."
2,"Used to be great, now it's pretty lame","i've been reading readymade since it started publishing. i worked at a bookstore and when the new issue would come out, we would all scramble to buy a copy. we usually sold out within two days. then the owners changed and the magazine became lame. there are fewer projects now and less content overall. remember the grass couch? where are the projects like that? i won't be renewing my subscription."
2,ReadyMade,"Does not have as much useful information as I had expected. I am great at re-using and re-making what I have, but this magazine does not have much of that information. It is mostly a minibiography of different people. I have only read one magazine to date, so hopefully, future magazines will have more useful informtion (useful to me)."
2,I was expecting more,"I've only gotten one issue but so far I haven't been too impressed. The magazine feels a little low budget (paper weight, photos, etc.) and the projects weren't anything I'd actually do."
1,NEVER RECIEVED MY SUBSCRIPTION !!!!,I ordered this mag. in Nov 08 & here it is the end of April 09 & I've yet to recieve anything ? After numerous emails assuring me my subscription would be starting soon...still nothing ! Finally requested a full refund. Still waiting ! Very poor communication from customer service. Would not reccomend purcasing this subscription.
1,If you're rich...,"If you have loads of money and just as much time, this magazine is for you. I find this magazine to be pretentious to such a degree that I just can't enjoy it. They occasionally have some interesting projects that the Average Joe can do and afford, but they're few and far between. I guess this magazine just wasn't meant for an average middle class individual such as myself."
2,Not as good as it used to be,"Years ago, this magazine was filled with creative DIY ideas with full instructions. Nowadays, it has more biographical stuff, with info about who is cool, what kind of coffee they drink, music they listen to etc, instead of focusing on DIY projects. The lifestyle praising of people that make things is getting old and stale. I would prefer to see more projects to inspire me to create. This magazine needs to get back to its roots or I may decide that time to let my subscription run out."
3,"hit or miss magazine, good luck with your subscription","The magazine is hit or miss. Sometimes I'm like ""Wow"", other times I'm like ""duh"". They're about 1 ""Wow"" and 2 ""duh""s for me, even though I bought a year subscription a little less than a year ago. [...]My advice? Skim it on the newsstand and buy it if you see something compelling. The spirit of the magazine is awesome. The content of the magazine is usually OK, sometimes good, never awesome. If you see something you like, sort of like if you see a good recipe while browsing for cookbooks, pick it up.[...]"
3,off to a promising start,"Here's a magazine that speaks to the inner tinkerer. In spite of its title, it's not about things that are ready-made but about a willingness to make stuff. The spirit behind it is good and refreshing.Unfortunately, the performance doesn't match the spirit. The projects are hokey and many of the ideas are embarrassingly banal. There's also not much in the way of instruction in basic skills.So if you don't mind a low good idea/page ratio, by all means subscribe-maybe they'll grow into it."
2,magazine,not as great of a magazine as I thought it would be. thought it would have more things to make. pretty boring
3,good enough,"if you want a scanner to give you high quality pictures, this is not the one for you... the quality is fairly good but ive seen better. I do recommend it if you dont care much about the quality because the price is very good."
1,Inflated Pricing,This is a single bowl for $13.99. I was sent the bowl in a previously returned box. I will be returning in the same box. Buyer Beware.
5,Absolutely Beautiful Ukulele Music,"As a ukulele player, I actively seek out ukulele music. I have an extensive library of vintage and modern ukulele music and I must say this is the most beautiful sounding and arranged album that I own. Yes, there are many excellent uke players out there, but this album is special; it's different then the others. Pop this CD into your deck, shut off all the lights in the room, so there are no distractions, and listen - really listen and you will see what I mean."
1,Piece of DOG S#@%!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It broke in about 15 seconds from the dog chewing on it. He broke one of the knob ends off after chewing on it and then the thing fell apart like a house of cards. I do not recommend buying this toy for any dog that is mildly rough with his/her toys.
5,"Very fun game, similar to Streets of Rage",I really enjoyed this game back in the day when my friends had it. I never owned an SNES but my friends did. They had this game and I really enjoyed it. It's similar to Streets of Rage for Sega Genesis.
2,Dries out your skin,The concept of caffeine in my soap was one that excited me to no end. I figured I'd wake up with a blast of energy and be extra awesome. It turns out it really just dries out your skin really badly. I had to abandon the soap and go back to standard issue Ivory soap.
3,Doesn't fit 99+ Blazer,"This is a well built Michigan made product. The mounting system for these uses a custom molded ""wedge"" to lock the mirror in place.This particular model DOES NOT fit 1999 or newer Blazers. It will work with the 1995-1998 model years. The mirror style changed and CIPA does not have a wedge that will fit the 99 and newer flat back mirror.I just got off the phone with CIPA customer service and was told that they would not produce the wedge for the newer style mirrors."
4,Great reference with an outstanding Index and CD Examples,"""Word 97 Macro and VBA Handbook"" is an excellent tutorial for people who have limited experience with Visual Basic. It is also an outstanding Word VBA reference book. (The index is unbeatable.) Lots of very useful examples, with analyses. In particular, the CD contains a complete example which showed me how to do something which Microsoft Premier Support said was impossible (activating macros in Word 97 docs from within an Outlook 97 form). The book isn't perfect, though. For example, the three page section on ""Disabling Screen Updating"" describes the pros and cons in depth, advises one to do it generally, but doesn't illustrate how to do it. I reread the section many times before turning to VB Help, which had the answer. Overall, though, a great reference, which was just the right tool for a difficult project I completed involving passing information from an Outlook 97 Task form to Word 97 forms."
2,"Title should be ""Introduction to Programming (using VBA)""","If you are a determined user or a novice programmer, then this book provides a superb introduction to writing Word97 macros and procedures in the VBA language. However, the book's title contains the word ""Handbook"" and its cover contains the word ""Complete"". The book is neither. When the going gets tough, the book ""cops out"". Although page 693 says ""I don't want to get too deeply into the details of cross-application VBA in this chapter."", the details are never shown. Further, page 700 says ""Beyond giving you a brief overview of the main DDE commands as shown in the following list, I'll leave you to investigate DDE on your own. Nothing is said about MailMerge (other than using the MailMerge Helper dialog box as an example) and there is only minimal information about how other applications can automate MsWord."
3,The Best Word VBA Book; Also the Only One,"If you want to write serious Word VBA applications the book starts on page 147. The first 146 pages simply deal with Word's built-in semi-automatic features, and are probably best left to a ""regular"" Word text.Once Hart-Davis gets going, however, his style is easy to follow as are his examples. He's also very complete in his coverage of the topic.On the negative side the enclosed CD has marginal utility, and I would have preferred to see the chapter on converting WordBasic to VBA a little earlier in the text than Appendix B. Nevertheless, this is the book to buy if you intend to write serious Word VBA applications. Of course, it's also the only book currently on the market that specifically addresses Word VBA. But even with no competition, it's not a bad book."
2,Could be better,"When I buy a book such as this, I expect it to be superior to the online help that comes with the software. It isn't. If you own Word 97, you are better off using the online help."
2,Let Down,"Initially I was impressed with this book, it seemed to be well written and to raise some interesting questions concerning architectural ideas of the present and future. As the book progresses the author's rhetoric gets a bit thin, causually citing references that are never elaborated upon leaving many of her arguements baseless. If you suffer from the ability to develop your own questions concerning the future of architectural thought/theory, whether you are an architect or from the 'outside', buy this book. Otherwise find an author that can actual communicate an idea beyond an initial thought."
1,This sucks,This Diva has done so much better than this. If it wouldn't for the producer's cool job and for her nice face this song would be a flop. It sucks. Why does she waste her wonderful voice on crap like this? Just wondering...
5,Blaring Proto-Metal,"I love this album! It pretty much started it all. It is very heavy and uncouth. Dickie Peterson screams like a maniac, while Leigh Stevens just blares away on his fuzz-filled, wall-blastin' guitar. Their cover of Summertime Blues actually went Top 20 in '68, but were still pretty much underground after that. This is 2 albums in one. Vincebus Eruptum and Outsideinside. If you are looking for sludgy proto-metal from the start of this glorious genre, go uot and buy this. You won't regret it."
4,There was magic in the air,"At the start of her career Joan Baez's pure, soulful voice was the signature of the early 60's folk movement; it is perhaps best displayed on this album and on Vol. 1 of the same. There is a special magic in her voice, her guitar and the response of the appreciative audience. The Portuguese song on this album, Nu Bello Cardillo, is touching but not as memorable as Ate Amanha on the first volume, while there's a lovely tremulous quality to her voice in the Dylan song With God On Our Side. My favorites on this second volume include the sorrowful tale of The Long Black Veil and the traditionals Hush Little Baby and Battle Hymn Of The Republic - the audience participation on the Hymn is very poignant and moving, and turns into a rousing spiritual experience. I personally prefer the first volume since more of those songs have personal meaning to me, but this folk classic is also an enduring treasure."
5,Pure vocal ecstasy,In 1962 Joan Baez was just starting to hone her craft as a singer of traditional folk songs. This is before her equally enjoyable period of more modern folk music. What you get in these early concert recordings is a voice accompanied by her own guitar in the purest form. It's interesting to return to these recordings after 40 years and see what a gift Joan Baez truly possesses.
4,I found it on SALE AT BabysRUs for $39.98!,"I did all of my online research & then visited our local ToysRUs. I found this wagon on sale for $39.99, had coupons & a birthday coupon! I walked out of the store only paying about $34.00!Online wants to charge $35 to ship this b/c of size/weight- forget it- go pick it up yourself & save $35!Wagon is great!"
1,Redesigned Wagon - DO NOT BUY!!,"If you are buying this wagon because of the nice holes in the side as we did, DO NOT BUY IT!!!! Little Tikes has redesigned the sides of the wagon and does not plan to change the packaging to inform you of this change. It took me two months, two new sets of sides and telephone conversations with three Little Tikes employees to finally find out that they redesigned the wagon in February 2001. The holes in the side, next to the Little Tikes logo, have been filled in."
5,wagon review,excellent size. much larger than other wagons of more money. needed a larger wagon and this fits the bill.
3,Wheels in the picture are different,My only problem with this item so far is that the wheels in the picture they show are different then what they really are. The wheels for the wagon are like huge shopping cart wheels (the ones that rotate 180 degrees)... you know the kind that if they are not pointed forward the cart won't move. When I was using it and I would go around a corner I would have to re-adjust the wheels so that they would point forward again. It was very frustrating. Other than that I like the room it has and I look forward to using it whenever I plan on walking in a straight line.
2,New model explorer wagon,"I was excited to order my explorer wagon. My brother's family had one, which I also used, and we LOVED it. I ordered my own, unfortunately, the new model just doesn't compare to the old one. It has a totally different steering system that makes it more than difficult to use. Walking and pulling the wagon straight works well, but backing up causes the wheels to go all over the place. The older version of this model had a yolk (axle) which kept the wheels in control. I don't know what Little Tikes was thinking."
5,we love this wagon!,"i walk several miles a day taking kids to school and picking them up. we had a regular red metal wagon that died after only 3 yrs. we picked this one up and we love it. its easy to pull, doesnt hurt your arm, the handle is big enough that if i dont have a kid riding they can held and ""help"". i fit 3 children in there with no problem and its safe for my 1year old as the side are high. it didnt run me over as i was walking down a hill, i like having that control. also it has rain holes, so no more inches of water in it! it has no educational value but this is a great wagon!"
4,My daughter loves this wagon.,"Our 2-year-old daughter loves the wagon. Despite being one of the smallest at the store it is huge for us. The large plastic wheels make it easy to pull over mulch (park), grass or dirt. It has plenty of room. I break it down as I have a small trunk, which is easy to do. It steers well and is very easy to clean. We are very happy with this purchase."
5,Great Investment,"My son is almost one and he loves to be pulled around in his wagon. He knows exactly what it is for and the back is big enough to support him when he leans back so that he doesn't fall out.The only negative is that if you leave the handle down and it rains, you will ge water in the handle that does not come out. My husband had to drill a small hole in the bottem of the handle so that it would not get mildew on the inside and smell.Overall this is a great toy. I would recommend it to anyone. Especially if you child is sick of the stroller."
5,Built to Last,"Our wagon came to us as a hand me down from my neice and nephew. It was purchased almost 8 years ago now and is still pulling my 20 month old daughter around. She loves it, in fact if she can't find anyone willing to pull her, she will place her dolls in the wagon and pull them around. I don't know if I could call it an educational toy, but is sure tires her out which is a wonderful thing at the end of the day.The sturdy plastic is easy to clean with some soap and water and a hose. It won't rust like a metal wagon, and you don't have to worry about any sharp edges. If you want a wagon I don't think you can find a better one."
5,Best wagon Ever,"I absolutely love this wagon. I have been using a old fisher price wagon that is quite a bit smaller. I walk my kids to school everyday and my younger kids were getting really tired so I borrowed my parents old wagon (the fisher price) and it worked ok...I had to squish my three little boys into it. Then I found this wagon and I have never been happier. It is BIG enough that I can fit 4 boys (5, 3, 2, and 6 mo) in with out it being too uncomfortable. It rides well and even with that much weight in it, it is still easy to pull. The sides are high enough that I don't worry about them falling out, and the handle is long enough to pull comfortably without worry about hitting the back of my feet. I absolutely love this wagon. Definately a good buy."
5,"Smooth, Quiet ride, comfortable for a child to ride in.","A great toy for a child to haul things in. It has a smooth, quiet ride, better than any I've seen. It is comfortable & easy for a child to ride sitting up, great for zoos. It also has a lot of room. My child also likes the removable sides. I would recommend this sturdy wagon to anyone!!"
4,"A Good Wagon, but Perhaps Not the Best Choice.","This wagon is overall well designed and extremely durable. It is also relatively lightweight, which makes it easy to load in the back of the station wagon for a trip to the zoo (or wherever). We have had lots of fun with it over the past several years. However, if I were to make the decision over again, I would purchase a wagon with rubber tires. The plastic wheels on this wagon are really noisy when riding along the sidewalks, and going over curbs or other bumps in the road (or gravel pathway) are much rougher and more difficult to maneuver than in a wagon with rubber tires. Granted, my 3-year old has never complained, but I would appreciate the extra benefits of the rubber tires."
2,noisy wagon. poor quality wheels.,This wagon is very noisy on ANY hard surface. The plastic wheels are thin and cheap. Spend a little more and get a radio flyer you'll be glad you did.
2,Wagon Parts are Hard to Get,"We ordered two of these wagons. The correct hardware did not come with the wagons. We called the company, and they sent new hardware. But, this hardware was incorrect as well. We called the company, and they sent new hardware once again. It was still not correct, so we modified what we had on hand to put the wagons together."
4,It's pretty good.,"A flashback to the past. Pretty interesting game, but hard (for me anyway) to figure out which way to jump at times. Then again, I'm just not very good at it. It you liked the old arcade game, you like this one."
5,The Orange Guy is back!,"After much anticipation I recieved this game, and it's the bestversion of Q*bert since his arcade release. The graphics are just amazing, the game play stays true to the original. If you buy one classic this year make it Q*bert for pc, or Playstation. You won't be sorry."
4,Guilty pleasure,"When I first got this game, I thought it stunk! The graphics are not all that good in the first level of the game, the movement is hard to figure out, and it looked nothing like the old school Q*Bert that I use to play when I was a kid. But I kept at it, and the game really grew on me. After the first level, the game gets better and better. You have to jump in 3D all over Q*Bert land. If you like cheesy games that remind you of your childhood, then this game is kinda cool."
4,Great film.,"As a fan of old school kung fun movies this is one of my favorite. Some of the best fighting I've seen in a shaw brothers film. The story is kind of weak,but didn't really bother me. The fighting scene at the end is excellent. My favorite venom sun chien aka the scorpion gets to bust loose and show his stuff in this one. Get this if you're a fan of the venoms of like good old school martial arts films. I would have given it another star if it had a better story and wasn't missing one venom."
3,"As usual, way overrated!",I dont see why this movie received so many high scores. Just because it has some of the venoms? This movie is mediocre at best. No classic and it doesnt deserve even a 3.5. I dont have the time to really explain. But the kung fu isnt as good as it is in other venom movies. The storyline is good but the ending is mediocre. Its only worth a rental if you're a fan of the genre. Its about to get donated to the salvation army.
4,Mirror,This is a real glass mirror and I would use no other. Still. you should know that the clamping mechanism is no good so you will have to fabricate your own. I am a recumbent trike rider and rely on this excellent mirror daily.
4,Real glass mirror.,"I wanted mirrors that weren't convex. I hate those, you can see cars behind you but you can't tell how far away they are. I also wanted real glass, the plastic ones scratch too easy. If the mounting system was just a little better I would have given these fine mirrors five stars. They do require a bit of tinkering and occasional re-tightening. No problem.Ed Waggoner"
1,not viewed as yet,"I cannot rate a book if I haven't read it, so the first field and second field do not count. I have a Remington Breadmaker and tried to make a fruit loaf in it. On the packets of Bread Mix for Fruit Loaf they list the amounts for every other Breadmaker but the Remington, and I would like to know the amounts and settings to use on my machine. Could you please contact me re this, or give this message to someone who will. I wish to use the machine to it's fullest and cannot if the information in the accompaying booklet does not have this information in it."
1,Do NOT waste your money on this CD.,"Don't let the selection of tracks listed for this CD sucker you into buying this. It's garbage. 85% of the tracks on it are in mono, and all of the tracks sound like they were downloaded off the internet at a low bit rate. In other words, they sound swooshy and distorted. A total waste of money. I don't know how the sound quality is on the other Al Wilson best of CDs, but this one is definitely one to avoid. It's a shame, because it has nice packaging."
3,Great voice but variable material/production lets down,"I bought this CD after buying and being knocked out by his prior recording of ""Searching for the Dolphins"" and sadly received it the week I read of his recent death in ""MOJO"" magazine.This CD covers 20 single and LP tracks of his recordings over two years for the Bell distributed Rocky Road label. It includes several Bilboard hits across that period and showcases again what a great voice the guy had. While a crop of good producers (including Johnny Rivers; Johnny Bristol and Steve Cropper) and some surprises (notably a steaming Creedence's ""Born on the Bayou"") the lack of top flight songs and some variable production (remembering that he was facing the onslaught of disco music at this time) leave it as an enjoyable listening but not up to the standard of ""Dolphins"" which is where I would recommend most new listeners start."
5,Excellent watch,"I bought this watch recently. Watch looks much better than what it looks on amazon website.I think only problem with this watch is name..Railmaster.... Which I think is not at all attractive.This watch is based on the famous model Railmaster CK 2914 created in 1957 as a successor to a watch produced for the British Air Force in 1953.This is a watch for life, not only in the sense of its timeless style, but also for its solid work horse movement.. the caliber 2403. I was told by Omega Dealer that this watch requires minumum maintenance due to Co-Axial Escapement.Also this watch has a Chronometer tag which means Caliber 2403 movement in this watch is certified by COSC. COSC is an Official Chronometer Testing Institute in Switzerland. Caliber 2403 movement in this watch is certified only after testing for fifteen days, in five positions and at three different temperatures."
4,"This is a DVD, not a book",I bought this item thinking it was a book. When a DVD arrived I was very dissapointed and a bit angry the purchase hadn't been clearer. But I watched the DVD and was very impressed by the quality of the content. It gave me much better visualising than I would be able to get in a book and picked up on handy hints that I might of just brushed over. Overall was very impressed with detail of the DVD.
3,CORN OIL,I have been a fan of Diamond Walnut Halves for many years. I don't like the fact that corn oil is used.
5,"""A HAUNTING PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!""","A young man was severely abused during childhood from his deranged father. As Michael gets older, he begins to have terrifying nightmares of his past, and he continues to get more-and-more. As he confronts his haunting memories, it begins to affect his everyday living until the nightmares are out of control, and as Michael suffers, so does everyone around him. A madness lurks in this abused man, and the end result is Danger as Michael tries to battle the demons within himself. This movie reminded me very much of ""SYBIL."" A horrifying past and a terrifying dangerous present. This chilling movie is an edge-of-your-seat, spine-tingling thrill ride through the haunted house of horror. Suspense is explosive, acting is excellent, and the events that took place will have you biting your nails. Highly recommended for all thriller and horror lovers!"
2,Loved Seaslon 1 not so much season 2,"I don't know, it is like the writers ran out of ideas that had anything to do with a community college at all. It was just weird."
5,Very Funny Offbeat Show,"I think this is one of the most adventurous comedies on television. They dare to be different, shooting entire episodes in unique styles - animation, sustained movie parodies, characters turning into flesh-eating zombies, and back again. Definitely worth checking out."
2,Defective disk,"Love the show, but when I got to disc 3 it didn't work. No scratches or visible damage, it just would not work. I tried on my XBOX, Sony DVD player and LG Blu-Ray....no luck. I bought season 1 through Amazon with no issues and will probably buy season 3 as well."
5,Amazing show,"I don't know where to start. Community is possibly the most innovative TV show of the past few years. It is hilarious, while exploring aspects of popular culture and the human mind. Dan Harmon really begins to experiment with the show in Season 2, trying out new ideas and breaking free of the class-oriented format. When watched in order, there is a clear evolution in style from Season 1 to Season 2 to Season 3. I highly recommend watching episodes multiple times, as each one has deeper messages that are difficult to pick up on the first time around. The challenges the study group goes through relate to the challenges of nearly all demographics. Considering Community may only have one more season (season 4), I suggest collecting these DVDs now so you can have a piece of one of the greatest TV shows produced."
5,Community: The Complete Second Season,"This was a Christmas gift for my son, who requested it. He was very pleased with the Community Second season."
5,pop pop!,"Community, a show that made me almost leave University to go to a community college and form a study group. Then I thought, no that's crazy. Instead I just watch the seasons causally whenever I need a great laugh. Community is a great show with every type of comedy man created and some they didn't, but still are still in the show and for that we should all build a blanket fort and watch Community!"
5,Best show on television (for as long as NBC will keep it on),"Such a great show. Too cool for this world. Great for any movie lover - many genre and auteur homage episodes, great ensemble cast."
1,Skip this one,"Skip this one, this episode is entirely in claymation and not funny in the least bit. It really is not worth watching."
2,ehhh,"thought it would be funny, but it ended it being really slow. I fell asleep and I wasn't even tired haha"
5,Best comedy always on the verge of being cancelled,"The second season keeps the laughs running from season one. Charachters are hilarious and make this show a weekly watcher. If you like The Office or Parks & Rec, you will love this."
5,Great season of a fantastic show,"This is the best season of a great sitcom. If this product is on sale and you're on the fence, pull the trigger. The bonus features are all fantastic including great cast commentaries with every episode featuring Dan Harmon, at least one core cast member, and a writer/director. This show is not available on BluRay, so get on board with the DVD!"
4,Hmm,"The price for this single (three songs) is about as much as I'd normally pay for a full-length album. So you're probably already a huge fan of Avril to begin with, or else you're better off exploring her full album, which is quite good I think.If you already enjoy the album and are a bit hesitant about dropping a significant amount of cash for this, let me remark that the song ""Why"" is the best song I've ever heard song by Avril. There's an earnestness that isn't matched by anything I've heard by her yet. Actually both of the new tracks on this are good; if you're a fan, pick it up."
2,This isn't complicated.,"Ok, let me start by saying that Complicated was my favorite song of 2002. Everyone loved how good it was and how much airplay it recieved. I bought this CD expecting Complicated. Well, it was Complicated, just not how I remembered. Complicated on this single is some weird remix. I hated the remix. Then I heard the rest of the CD which was actually worthless. I Don't Give and Why were both medicore.1. Complicated (Remix) 1/52. I Don't Give 2/53. Why 2/5Overall 5/15 30% F"
2,The launch pad for an annoying rebel-image poster child,"Oh please!...NOOO! All it takes is one song like ""complicated"" to worm someone like avril lavigne into radio play hyperdrive with a song that's catchy- the FIRST FEW times you hear it. I'm reminiscent of artists like eminem and vanessa carlton. The most annoying thing about avril is probably her image: the underdeveloped wild girl who dates ""sk8er bois"" and tries to compensate for what she lacks by trying to be a sexy little rebel with an attitude problem who has little self respect, helps kids to see they can all take advantage of the marketing scheme that pays her bills for BSing, and she won't stop tilting her head and glaring her eyes in her little characteristic look that's so fake-looking and a poor attempt at imitating a moody model. Unfortunately, in every North American high school there are scores of kids in tune to the same image and will probably be keeping her in the limelight for a while."
5,Amazing Photos,"This book is great, if only for the amazing photos. I have many books on Idaho ghost towns, and while this one does not have as much written information as many of the others, it has the best photos of any of them! It would make a great coffee table book."
1,misinformation or typo,"I bought this book as a gift. Since my parent are from that area I thought they'd enjoy it. However after I read the book I found a pretty major mistake. In chapter 3 the writer refers to the Pacific County seat as being ""North Bend"" when its actually South Bend. One can only hope the writer didn't make any more mistakes."
4,cheap and works,"no problems with it so far. cheap and works. and i wouldnt care if it broke because of the price. the cat loves it, could do without the crappy shape filters.... just becomes annoying."
5,Laser pet toy,"The cats love it, good exercise, long ago I had one that you could turn on or off which I liked. This one is safer I am sure, but sometimes I get tired of holding the button down."
4,Fun for the furballs,"My cats go nuts for this thing but really only for the dot. The other images are not bright enough to hold their interest and it's not like they are all ""hey, it's a smiley face!"" Also, get extra batteries as they run out fast!"
1,Cheap Product,"I bought the item, and as soon as I opened the packaged I was wondering if it was going to work and if so, how long it would last. Needless to say, after about 2 hours of use, the item just stopped working. I beleive it had something to do with the cheap button used to turn the product on. Yes, it was a cheap toy to buy price wise, but I guess I got what I paid for."
3,Laser for dog to chase,"My dog loves this. He will chase it until he drops. However, it is not made real well. The laser keeps going off and you have to twist the image plate on the end just a bit to get it to come back on every 30 seconds or so. But, we are still enjoying it."
2,Great.. When it Works,"My cat loves the laser pointer, but unfortunately it doesn't always work. In the beginning, you just had to give it a little shake and it'd start working, but after more use, it'd take a lot of fiddling with the top and the batteries and now it's not working at all. Would love it if it continued to work, but now I'm on here looking to buy a new one. This time I'll try another brand."
3,Average,"It's neat because it has different shapes at the turn of the end wheel, but the button is kind of hard to hold for very long."
5,Really nice,"This thing is really cool, or should I say ""was""? I only bought this for testing purposes only, so once it got to my hands I teared it appart to see what was inside it. Needless to say: I did this on purpose, the build quality is great, and should you need it for the intended reason, go for it, it'll do the job."
2,My cat loved it... until it broke.,"My cat absolutely loved it (just the laser, the other shapes were moot)..The product was cheap in design.You get what you pay for. I think we'll spring for a little extra in quality on our next purchase."
1,Laser doesn't work most of the time!,"This laser is cheaply made, and I often have to reset the batteries in it to get it to work. I believe the button that activates the light isn't seated properly to make a connection with the power source. Buy something that is more solid, rather than spending the $4 on this one. It's not worth the hassle!"
1,Button issues,I noticed from the get-go the button really didn't work. After about five pushes of the button it fell off! It was then I could tell the actual actuator button isn't placed correctly to receive the external rubber button. I now have to wedge a pen cap in it to get it to work.
5,Great toy for dogs or cats!,I can not say enough good about this little inexpensive toy. My dogs go crazy over the light. My son has a Sphinx and a Devon Rex cat. They will jump half way up the wall for this light. The different patterns do not make any difference. The light itself is what makes it so much fun. This would make a great souce for running off energy during rainny days or cold winter days when going outside is not possible. Thank you Amazon for selling this toy!
1,Didn't even last 30 minutes!,This is definitely a horrible product. I put the batteries in and played with my cat for maybe 15-20 minutes and it just stopped working. Changed the batteries and still didn't work. Really poor quality.
1,junk,DONT BUY IT CHEAP GARBAGE.TAKE IT FROM ME I SPEND ALOT OF MONEY MONTHLY HERE DONT BUY THIS YOU WILL THANK ME
1,over a month and still waiting,"I purchased two of these lasers over a month ago with the hope that they would make it here around christmas. Unfortunetly, the lasers have not yet arrived. The other items that I ordered that day arrived within two weeks."
2,Lasted for a week.,"Not very happy. It worked well at first but in a week it stopped working well. When I opened it to check, one of the button batteries had broken in half. Then I found out it costs more to replace the batteries than I paid for the device."
4,just what I needed.,For what I paid for it this little guy is perfect. My cat seems to like the dot best of all the settings though he will chase the mouse setting.
1,Bad product!,This product stopped working after 5 minutes and all the shapes looked the same. I tried I'm returning right away.
3,meh...,"My cat could care less about the laser. I really thought she would love playing with it but she just looks at the light, then looks at me, then turns around and walks away... She is a little older now, shes 6 but she just doesn't seem interested at all.The laser itself works good, no problems. I do wish that when you clicked the button it would stay on instead of having to hold the button down the whole time but that is minor, and as she isn't interested in it anyways it really doesn't matter.Not bad for 5 bucks and maybe you would have better luck with a younger cat or kitten."
4,Cat Laser,My cat Noel loves this toy but the batteries already are going out and we've only used it for two weeks!!
1,Blah,Received this today I was able to use it for exactly ONE minute and the thing got hot and broke. This being my first real amazon order I'm a bit scared to order more items. Very unhappy with this. Cat got to chase the red dot for one minute. Disappointed
2,I don't know what makes this a pet laser...,"It's just a laser, and a low quality one as it breaks down easily. I bought one for my cat and the batteries died after 2 hours of use. Not a good buy at all but worked fine for the first 2 hours. You can only see the dot, the rest of the laser figures are too dim to see with the naked eye.Don't buy this for your pet, it's horrible."
5,Great Laser,My son loves his new laser. It does all that it says it will. We are pleased with this product.
1,Weak sauce,"The 5 different laser images are useless, but I'm not as worried about that. The light worked for just one night. Near the end, the button got really hard to press. At some point, I accidentally twisted the top section instead of the silver part that changes the images, and it came right off. There's no way to put it back on, and once I took out the whole inside, the rubber button fell out. There's really no way to put it back together now, except maybe superglue. And what everyone else said about the batteries - hard to replace. Not worth 4 bucks."
4,This is just too funny,I don't know what it is but the dog chases it around like he is after a bug or something. It is so funny to watch him and it is perfect for giving him a little exercise during the winter months. No problems with the actual unit when we removed it from the package and so far the batteries are still working just fine.
2,Displeased,"The product was so cool when I got it. My cat loved it, it was his favorite toy. But after having it for 2 weeks the button you push just broke off. So now the only way I can use it is by pushing a pen in the hole to turn it on. VERY disappointing!!!! O yeah love Amazon.com ordered it and got it just in time for christmas!!!"
1,My cats are not interested at all!,"Very disappointed...My two cats are not responsive to any of those five shapes. Besides, the laser is pretty weak, hardy seen in a not so bright room"
2,You get what you pay for....,I think I expected to much from this for the little I paid for it. The batteries died within 2 weeks. The part I really didn't like the most is that you have to hold the button down the whole time when using the laser pointer. Wish there would have been an option to switch it on (leave it on) and switch it off.
2,Don't waste your money,"My Westie loves to chase laser lights, so this seemed perfect. It only lasted 2 play sessions and just died. Not worth it, even as an add-on. Think of it as disposable and you may get your money's worth. While it worked it was bright, and my dog loved it."
2,Arrived broken; dead batteries,"Really, the subject of this review says it all. Two stars were for reasonable price point, though if it is as poorly made as it looks, I'm being overly generous. Sent back and won't replace with same product."
3,Could definitely be brighter. Cat likes it though.,"The different designs are more of a fun idea for the user as the cat seems to like the brighter single dot best. That being said, the light isn't as bright as I had hoped, and the designs aren't rotated properly inside (some are sideways or upsidedown - but of course the cat doesn't care)."
3,I LOVED it...and then...,"I bought this as a last attempt hope to get my cat to play with something. She is 12 years old and hates all toys. Well, she LOVED it!! She chased that little red dot all across our house! She didn't care about any of the other shapes, just the normal lazer.Now, the problem. I bought this on July 8th. I had to buy a 2nd set of batteries before August. I just bought another set 3 days ago, and guess what, they're already dead. I did not use this combined for more than an hour. I will not continue to purchase batteries for this, instead I'll get a better laser."
1,Not Good,"Broke in less than a month. The rubber button that you press to make it work came out of this hole. You would think that you could just put it back, but you are wrong. We now have it taped into place. Just what I wanted a jerry-rigged laser that doesn't work some of the time. NOT!"
4,Zoom!,"This will drive any sane cat bonkers. Great for pre evening, pre catnap use. The cat loves it and never sops chasing it."
5,Great for bz presentations,This is a reliable tool for business presentations and the dogs love it also. It provides a lot of entertainment for them
2,Exceedingly cheap construction,"While the laser light itself is strong, the product itself is shoddily constructed. The rubber button is prone to falling off and if it's lost, you can't hold it down in order to operate the laser."
3,My dog figured it out pretty quick,"I got this to entertain my 1-year-old puppy but she figured it out pretty quickly. I think it might be better for a cat. She chased it for about a minute before she figured out the ""pretty light"" was coming from mom's hand...then she just wanted to get that instead of the light. So I'm thinking I wasted my money on this one. I guess I'll stick with the dog bubbles....she loves to chase them."
2,"Being generous, it is just ok.","It's not really a toy for my cats, just a distraction unfortunately, but I can't blame it for just being a light and cats are picky about toys.But what I can point out as not really fun is the button to keep it on. I was hoping I could use it when my arms were tired, but it is not at all comfortable to hold the button to light it down. It's fairly finger intensive for someone with sore digits much of the time. May work for other cats, but not for mine.Doesn't work for what I needed, so if you need an easy toy, at least get one that doesn't need to be pushed constantly to light up."
1,waste of money!!!!!,this so called laser pointer does not work at all you can only see it if its very dark the light is really weak if your looking for something that will project then you are not looking for this only gave if one star because i had to!:(
1,It's Simple,"This product sucks! The seller was great, please don't misunderstand my review. And the idea for the product is a good one. The product itself, though... NOT so good. Just made very cheaply - reflected, I suppose, in the price. I am not mad, mind you, because I believe I got what I paid for. Long story short, I went to Wal-Mart and bought a laser mouse toy for my cats, took the batteries out of the junky laser, saved them and threw the laser away!"
2,Cat laser toy,"I was disappointed in this item for two reasons. One, it is very flimsy and not much to it. Two, I walked into my local Walgreens and saw the exact same item (regular price) for $3.99 (I paid $5.99). The laser does work and does amuse the cats but definitely is not worth the $5.99 I paid. Buyer beware..."
3,Not interested...,"Well, everybody kept telling me this was something I NEEDED for the cat. So I gave in, and got it. For a total of 5 seconds the cat was interested, then she figured out where the source was, and she thought my hand moving was way more interesting.Now, I can wave this all I want, she doesn't care. Once in a while she will humour me and run across the floor once, twice if I'm lucky, but in general, this was a waste of money :( On the other hand, it's a good pointer, so I use it for presentations instead..."
2,laser pointer disappointingh,"5 halogen laser pointer not that great, the only shape the cats enjoy is the dot. You have to be in low light to see the other shapes. Would not recommend this produce. I bought this one because it had free shipping."
5,Crazy Kitten!,"I wasn't sure about this toy when I bought it. Then I opened and my cat just spazzed out over it! He played with if for about 30min. and then crashed! The toy has five different shapes on it. A star, dot, butterfly, smiley face, and a mouse. The mouse doesn't really look like one, but it's close enough!"
3,This book is out of date,"I think that just listing this book with its now inappropriate title, ""The *New* Encyclopedia of Freemasonry"", and saying it was published in 1994 misleads a lot of people even if you throw in the word ""reprint"". If you want to do historic research on what people thought in the early 1900s, it's fine. But there has been a lot of research since then. If you want a good up to date Masonic Enclopedia, get Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia which was extensively revised in 1995."
5,read,i wanted to read this book to see the information contained with in.overall interesting book for a traveling man.all aspects of transaction were satisfactory.
1,This book is generally unreadable.,This book is very difficult to read and understand. It would seem the author is more interested in forming complex word groups using obscure and outdated words than in having the readers understand the material.
5,Great idea!,"I bought version 1 quite a few years ago and loved it. What a novel idea. The blades are very good quality and the handle/latch mechanism works great. It only came with 1 handle tho so could only be used by 1 person. This 2nd generation kit has 2 handles and the case is better made so they've improved it. I use it camping or going over to a friend's house for a cookup, anyplace away from home. Wish it came with a smaller utility blade but that's the only quibble I've got."
2,Just Don't throw away the box!,"Our two boys loved the race track and cars the first day. Then one car broke and shortly after the second one broke as well. My husband and I threw away the box and could not find replacment cars or parts anywhere! The track has held up, however the race cars are not durable at all and not worth the money and hassle."
5,"Ace Hardware Direct is Terrible, Bat Combo is nice","BUY THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE! Ace Hardware Direct is terrible. Combo took 11 days to ship (Although they say 3-4 days of processing?). I called after a week and was told it would ship that day only to finally get the shipping confirmation 4 days later. Stay away from them is all I have to say, unless you are willing to wait out their terrible supply chain process. And if you call for information on when your order will ship, be prepared to get an earful of nonsense.As for the bat combo though, it is of very nice quality. The kids enjoy it and the size is just right for them to use it properly and swing it without issue."
4,Interesting for Hard-Core Nuke Fans,"If you're a hard-core, die-hard aficionado of nuclear weapons issues (in other words you get high reading about obscure, esoteric minutiae), this is the book for you. The author has shown admirable resolve in tracking down the details about the whys and wherefores of the nuclear weapons community's disdain for the damage caused by nuclear-induced fires. However she does get redundant more than she needs to be, and she early on makes the salient points that the rest of the book ponderously reiterates. She touches on the nuclear winter controversy, but in an almost cursory fashion; odd, considering the central role fires played in that raging debate. (I am proud that I avoided saying ""that firestorm of controversy."")Still I recommend adding it to the nuke fan's library as she does add a needed dimension to the entire philosophy of nuclear war fighting, a concept too absurd to exist in any but our own techno-crazed society."
1,It's HooDoo alright!,"I know Dave Johnson. I know Mason County and have researched extensively there, though my interest was not the HooDoo War. The HooDoo War is one of the very most interesting, complex ... fun ... incidents in the Old West.So I was disappointed when the book came out. Names, relationships, facts are presented in such a manner as to wonder why the publisher let this one go without an extensive re-write. Now, granted, the HooDoo War deserves a much bigger treatment, but crammed into this slim volume, no good came of it."
1,Better than nothing.,I've just finished working through the Version 8 edition of 'Step by Step Tutorial'. I found it is a very elementary introduction - suitable for teaching an experienced cad user the basics of Archicad. The instructions for the excercises are not at all complete without also refering to the videos provided on the 'Interactive Tutorial' provided with the program. I've come to Amazon.com hoping to find something better.
2,ARCHICAD step-by-step tutorial ver. 7,"This is not actually a third party 'guide' for ArchiCAD, this book comes with the purchase of the application itself so it is like a manual, sadly it is unable to cover much. In fact i have one on ver 6.5."
3,In spanish ?,"This book (ArchiCAD Step by Step Tutorial, version 6.5 by Thomas M. Simmons)can be write in spanish language ?Espero su respuesta ! gracias"
2,Convert to disappointment,"after two stunning albums under his Converter project, i was looking forward to Exit Ritual. He was even playing at a club the night i bought the album. His live set was great, and just what any fan of rythmic noise would ask for. So when we left the club with our hands tightly clutching his new album we were very very excited. What we got was poor. Droning atmospheres that went nowhere and were seamingly created with little or no imagination whatsoever. Its not that I dont like dark ambient, i do, but this was lacklustre.Having recently bought his newer album released under his own name (Scott Sturgis - In A Haze) I can see what he was trying to achieve with Exit Ritual, its just a shame that he didnt get it right first time round, but it did rest my mind that it was just a case of trying something new as opposed to just not being bothered."
2,Superficially clever in many sections but it comes up short.,"The book attempts to be an observation about the unreliability of language. Stories turn out to be of questionable accuracy as further clues about them are found later in the book. There are slips of the tongue, accusations of plagiarism and many different variations of a story and these also cast doubt on the reliability of the stories told. The chapter involving Galvanauskas with its emphasis on the critical theory about the struggle by the reader to master a text seems to be a way of throwing down the gauntlet to the reader. However the author gets too carried away with his admittedly clever games and they become the point of the book instead of whatever he wants to say about language. Ultimately, there is not enough payoff to justify the time the reader has to spend nailing down the complications. Also, ""An Open Mind"", the long chapter in the middle, has a non-credible central character and this completely takes the steam of the book."
2,(-_-),"This movie really had potential of being a gud 1.The storyline sound Kool & the action was IGHT as well. WHAT pissed me off,other then it being almost 3 hrs long, is that the WHOLE movie is repeatitive!All,i think there were 5, brothers all fight long 10-15 min fight scences at the same exact location. Another reason this film sucked was because of the anticipated ""Secret"" technique the brothers learn IS LAME!!!Do your self a fav & dont buy this if U must see it rent it or youtube it"
1,garbage,this movie was terrible. don't waste your time with this one it is sub-standard compared to a lot of the other shaw brother films. if someone gave me this as a gift i would burn it
4,"White Wolf Does It Again, But Not So Hot This Time Around.","Of the various incarnations of Vampire: The Masquerade editions I've gone through, I really didn't like this one. It shouldn't matter really but I didn't quite like the artwork in this one. It's descent but the art was better in previous editions. The same rules and character archetypes remain but my only complaint is the art and it seems like no one is really playing live roleplaying games anymore."
1,Not nearly as good as Vampire the Requiem,"My group and I are just getting into these games and a friend brought this one over, claiming it was the mother of Requiem. I looked through it and am amazed and how poor it is in terms mechanics and rules. Its also out of print since it White Wolf has launched its much better, newer, improved version: Vampire the Requiem. In any case I wanted to post here because in case you are looking for this game it is no longer in print and its really not the same game as Requiem.I'm going to pass since the Requiem rpg is so much better written and the focus is more on how supernatural creatures interact with each other."
4,Vampire: The Masquerade,"This book is a nesecity to all Vampire role players. It includes a selection of weapons, all of the roles for different systems, and gives you several other refernces such as a role to climb or throw something. This book also gives some hints on story lines incase you aren't completely creative. It gives you sample characters for other creatures, too. So even if you don't have the other books, you can use these sample stats. Also, if you don't want to put the time into making a human for them to kill, you can use the sample they give you for a normal person, or a gang banger. All in all, this book is very informative and useful while playing."
4,Different and fun. keep 'em coming WW,"The World of Darkness is, in and of itself, a depressing world. As it should be. It is an alternative world like our own in which corruption and death are so commonplace as to be vulgar. The world is ending and most humans are mindless, content zombies who find nothing wrong with the pollution and deceit all around them. In Vampire, you get to be one of the corrupters, a chance to be a monster of legends. The Undead, the Damned, you name it, they got it. One of the best parts of this game is your imagination is required at all times. None of this ""i'm gonna go kill an orc *swish* Oh, hes dead."" Here, you kill that orc and the whole damned human race is on your tail. Watch out..... they're watching. And Gehanna will come soon.Ravenlock, Gangrel"
4,A face lift for an old favorite.,"A true revision over the previous two editions (both of which were already excellent), Vampire, Revised smooths over some of the rough spots inherent in the game system (i.e. several of the clans, most notably the Malkavians, evolved significantly since the second edition, and Revised brings them up to date). Sweeping changes are afoot, both in the rules (fixing the semi-broken skills system, and the entirely broken merit Iron Will) and in the game background (a bloodline has fallen, another one grown stronger, and the independent Clans are flexing their might). All in all, quite remarkable.What fails the book is what has failed all other revisions of the books: most people who will buy Vampire, Revised already own Vampire, 2nd Edition. Without some kind of index, there's virtually no way for readers to find all of what's new in this edition, and that can slow or cripple game play."
5,Absolutely amazing...,"I got my V:tM sourcebook several months ago, in either March or April... I have read it and used it so excessively that the cover has fallen off, but I still love this book... Even for those who don't want to play the game, it's a fascinating new look at vampires, or Kindred as they may be called. Ever since I started playing in an online campaign, I've been absolutely hooked on Vampire... I'd recommend this book to anyone who had even the slightest intrest in Vampires, even if you're not into roleplaying... Amazing."
5,Still love 2nd Ed.,"I have been playing V:tm as Storyteller since 1996. I will always have a soft spot for the 2nd Ed. That being said, the revised edition makes things easier for the newer players that have joined my troupe. ALL of the 13 main clans are together, all of the disciplines are included (fixing how most of them were broken, most notably fortitude). One thing that I noticed was that in the character creation section the Sabbat are now created the same as the Camarilla's vamps. Most of the changes have been for the better, but as mentioned in other reviews, most of the mystery and a lot of the aesthetic of the 2nd Ed. is gone."
4,Where did I put my Bauhaus?,"Vampire: The Masquerade is a one of the better World of Darkness series out there. Although I reccomend Hunter: The Reckoning for ideal beginnings, V:TM is truely fun for player and storyteller alike.I'd also like to point out that, in order to get the right enviroment for a lot of these games, you might want to pick up some (if not all!) of the CDs the reccomend. It's good music, too.As to the complaints that all WoD games are stand-alone: you storyteller can fix that. Get on their case about it. I know mine did."
1,Fluffy Descriptions and Uninteresting Characters,"As a juvenile book this may work, but as an adult thriller it left me wanting. I couldn't even finish it! Too many fluffy adjectives and descriptions of unrelated details. The action moved along at too slow a pace, and I just couldn't get past the slow start. I felt no attachment to the main character, Randall McLagan, and often stopped myself in mid-read to say, ""Who cares?"""
4,Tracklisting,1. Share The Fall (Full Vocal Mix Edit) 4:182. New Forms 7:483. Share The Fall (Way Out West Remix) 6:224. Share The Fall (Grooverider's Jeep Style Mix) 6:28
2,Not as good as previous model,"We have a friend who has the older model of this, of which our son fell in love with. We decided to purchase one, but did not realize that Tonka removed a few key features on the new model. The new model only raises and lowers the fork lift and a light that you can turn on. The older model did this, plus a motorized tilt function, a controller that moved the toy front and back, and an option to put the toy from motorized movement to a free wheel push.My reco is to go onto E-Bay and purchase the older model. Tonka cheaped out on the new model. You can tell the difference between the two models by the back levers. The new one has two and the ""cool"" older one has three.Best of Luck"
3,A look at America's attempts to influence ethnic conflicts,"Unwinnable wars is good, but not great. It covers to some level most of the recent ethnic conflicts (Kurds, Yugoslavia, Rwanda and others), however rather than cover any of them in detail, the author looks at America's attempts to influence the outcomes. More details on the horrors of these ethnic conflicts would have made the book more powerful. The author takes an academic approach to the issue, which is good, not too emotional. Overall a good book on potential solutions to the issues raised by worldwide ethnic conflicts."
4,Interesting and fun read,I can't say that I'm a big fan of Tom's but I have seen a couple of his movies. Tom writes in a very honest and funny style and I enjoyed this book a lot.
5,any fan must have,"Well Sad to say i havent read this yet, but im going to buy it today and hopefully start to!! but cmon any tom green fan must have this book!! he is a legend~ and always will be!"
5,Great textbook,"This is a great cosmology textbook used in some universities for undergraduates. The math involved is about college-level algebra, so you don't need to know calculus with this book. Make sure you get the 2nd edition (2005) which includes the major discoveries and updates in cosmology that happened in 1998."
5,"Larnelle, I Want to be a Star","I always expect quality music from Larnelle, but I didn't expect this release to grow on me as fast as it did. The story-telling and lyrics behind this collection are exceptional, and of course, Larnelle's outstanding voice brings it all to life. The music is beautiful and comes in a variety of tempos and themes. Very nice tracks!1. Soon2. If Not for the Storms3. I Will Pray4. ... But God5. Anyone6. I Want To Be a Star7. When Fear Comes Knocking8. The Greatest Of These9. Look at Your Hands10. More to the Story"
5,"If you haven't heard them, buy it!!!!!!","I've listened to speed metal, punk, industrial, and hard core since I was a kid swapping tapes(yes...I'm 30). These guys rock. Thats all I can say. If you like Killswitch Engaged, All That Remains, White Zombie, Slipknot, or Distubed....you should check these guys out, you won't be sorry."
2,"Pretty much, another waste of money...","Pretty much all these movies are about having sex, then dying shortly after by a witch or demon. There are some good sex scenes if that is all you're after."
2,Terrible product?,Well to start off let me mention that the serving size is 6 capsules! That's a lot considering....now to address my title...I was at the nutritionist the other day and I had brought the supplements that I was currently taking (this being one of them) and the doctor and nutritionist both mentioned that it was pretty much a waste of money and that there was hardly any vitamin d. I will not be buying this product again.
5,Great perspective & insight!,"This is a great addition to your library if you have any interest in either meditation and/or a martial art. What are the ""tangible"" benefits of these practices, why are they worthwhile, and what relevancy are they to modern cultures?"
5,Full of research like information about suicide,"This books looks at suicide from a more intellectual research point of view. But after saying that, this book isn't hard to read or crammed full with academic jargon. It definitely enlightened me about suicide. However this isn't the type of book suited for mourning or self-help.I would recommend this book if anyone wants more information about suicide as a subject."
4,Solid Biography,"The cover doesn't look like much, but this book does a solid job on the life of Livingstone. My only critique is a lack of good maps. Livingstone was an explorer, therefore maps are of the essence. Wish there were more."
3,I need you to enable me.,"This is a musical comedy CD. Songs are played in a variety of musical styles. Some songs are pretty funny, some not-so-funny. The best songs are ""Co-Dependency"" and ""Killer Resume"". There is a hidden bonus track, which is a one minute song played backwards."
3,Missing parts,"I bought two. One has all teh parts and instructions. The other one did not.However, I was able to use the 24 year old original Honda parts to make it work.I got lucky."
1,Too many errors and sloppy editing.,"While this book contains useful information, the book contains too many errors for it to be used for any but the most casual purpose. Meaning is confused by bad editing and sloppy table construction. On page 589 the Atlantic Ocean is listed as 5.5 percent of total (total of what?), while the Pacific Ocean is listed as 48.9 percent of total. One might assume that the reference is to area since the column to the left lists the Pacific's area as 64,186,300 sq. mi.and the Atlantic's area as 33,420,000 sq. mi. But as anyone can see if 64,186,000 is 48.9 percent then 33,420,000 is certainly not 5.5 percent. The total row at the bottom of the table list a sq.mi. total figure and 100.0 percent. The respective columns to not add to those figures. What was left out? Other problems are double words and spelling errors. Don't buy the book."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","This book could have been really good. It has a ton of different topics, so anyone should be able to find some interesting info. One of the problems about this book is that it is poorly laid out and sections that do not seem relevant are thrown into other sections. My biggest gripe though is the editing. There are a lot of typos, misspelled words and double written sections. There are a few cases of the facts being blatantly wrong which makes me question the other areas that I do not know much about. This book should be corrected and everyone who owns the first book should be given the second edition for free."
5,Great love it,I really love this game it has all the old games that people can play taht doesn't deal with violence like all the new games that they make today thank you for keeping purity alive in these types of game we need more of them and less of the other ones Amen
1,Wrong game,"The game that was in the case was the wrong game. I wanted ""The Next Tetris"" and what was in the case was ""Tetris World"" completely different game. Not the sellers fault it was a sealed case but wasn't happy I didn't get the game I wanted."
4,Fun fun fun!,"If you like the original Tetris, but you also want something new and interesting, you'll probably like this game a lot. You get to choose between Classic Tetris and The Next Tetris, and the soundtrack and graphics are pretty nice. The game play in both modes, as well as the Next Tetris choices, are quite fast-paced. Probably the only thing I can even remotely find fault with is the block wobble option (I found it a bit distracting), but since you can shut it off under the 'Options' screen it's no big deal."
3,Blew it on this one,Nobody to blame but myself - the game is a re-buy for a copy that was stolen a couple of years ago - and tetris games are hard to find. BUT... next time I'll be more careful where I click. I had intended to purchase a used copy for about $5. What I got was a brand new copy for $54. Not smart. I'd kinda like a do-over. Next time...
5,Books for Boys! (and girls too),"It is hard for me to find books for my boys with dyslexia. The books at their reading level are boring to them, but the books they want to read are too hard. This series is an answer to a prayer! The stories are exciting (in this one, it's implied that the mongoose is almost eaten by a snake). My boys love them."
3,This gift wasn't a hit. Maybe my fault.,This was a gift that wasn't a hit with my son. Maybe my fault. Maybe just a thankless son. You'll have to decide for yourself.
3,The zippers are cheap plastic,"The bag itself is nice, very spacious and plenty of places to place your gear. The problem is the zippers are cheap plastic. The first one broke off in my hand the first time I opened the lid. The 2nd one snapped later the same day. Now I have to pinch the zipper to use it and it's a pain."
3,Better than the OCR that came with your scanner,"I purchased this software in the hopes that it would be a major improvement over the ocr software that came with my Epson scanner. However, even though I think it is a better program, I am uncertain whether it was worth the price of the upgrade. Even though its documentation states that it is 99% accurate - my testing of the software shows that it is about 80% accurate. The software works well - however, the feature where you can have your document read back to you does not work as expected."
1,Omnipage Pro 10 OCR,"Caere manufactures this. But they don't ""care."" I erased the copy I bought AND REGISTERED and they said ""tough luck."" So I bought version 10. It's no better than 9--maybe worse. Version 8 was as good. By the way, if you try to use somebody else's copy--and you don't register--they'll cut you off after 25 uses. Talk about ""big brother."" If you can find another brand, do it."
1,ORU limited versions,"I believe it is down right dishonest the way Caere and others ship, basically, a demo version. Mine stopped working after 25 uses. Heck, I had not even learned how to operate the thing.Anyhow, I found myself needing an OCR program, so I ordered it thru Amazon (Amazon shunted me off to another vendor - which I cannot remember.)After having the unit sent to me in July 2000, I learned that Ver 9 is obsolete. Why would Amazon allow obsolete software to be shipped?"
5,great song,one of those just purly great songs.her voice is of an angel and the melody is from heaven.you can appreciate the song better if you have seen great expectations.
5,Buy it now!,"This song is so beautiful,like a poem,and mono's angel voice can really make you in heaven...Listen to the song and you can tell."
3,life in mono,I don't know whats going on here all i want to do is download the song life in mono and i don't know how and some way it leaded me to this so who ever gets this please help me and email me at star262@hotmail.com thanx
4,Cool,"Elmore Leonard does it best, but this author is on the right track. I'll look for his other work."
1,What a disaster,"Having read the glowing recommendation, I bought this thing. Yechhhh. I have no doubt that that reviewer was right, but if so he must have had incredibly sophisticated tone controls, perhaps a superb equalizer, in his stereo system -- This thing is almost unbelievably SHRILL. I turned my lowly treble control [on a B & K preamp] all the back, and it was STILL painfully shrill. This almost always results from the unfortunate practice, in the ""classical""-music industry, of hiring ""engineers"" who have worked as well in the ""rock 'n' roll"" ""industry"" and who, as a result, have blown out their high-end hearing, with the result that they have to crank the treble sliders all the way up to hear the highs...which in turn causes the recordings to be 'way too ""hot"" for those of us who still have normal hearing. Avoid this like the plague -- unless, of course, you too have either lost your treble hearing, OR have an extremely sophisticated set of tone controls."
2,"Worst ""Ebben?"" I've ever heard","Could the soprano be any more off-key during the opening minutes of the highlight aria? I don't think so. Wow, it's awful. And the overall sound is crap. At least she improves in the second half of the song. As an a-cappella singer myself, out-of-tune singing is painful. I can't think of anything good to say about this recording, other than you get the whole opera, which is hard to find."
3,Mac Game programming,"This book is a little out-of-date, but goes hand-in-hand with its counterpart for programming games for Windows(r). This book takes your through the basics through full game development. If you want a starter book then this is a good one."
4,An Excellent Book except for so many typos,"This book is so much helpful to beginners of network programming like me. The supplied libraries in this book are also very useful in developing network programs safely and bug-free. However, since my book is the first printing, there are so many typos... It is very inconvenient of me to read it because I have to correct many bundles of typos whenever it's going on... I heared somewhere that the fourth printing is come out...maybe I'll buy it of the FOURTH priting AGAIN..."
5,The only book you need for IPC and Sockets,"For those of you who do network programming, this book is the only one you will need. Pack full of examples and behind the scenes information. This is the bible of network programming."
5,Very well done,"W. Stevens is actually the departed person I think most about missing. Just browsing through his book, I learned more about networking and network programming than I have from any other place. Any implemtation, no matter the language or platform, is relatively transparent after reading this book.He gives a great deal of himself in all his books I've read; sharing the little test programs he writes to finally pin down how something is implemented. And he did all the grunt work of communicating with people like Kernighan and Ritchie to elucidate some points that are not found in books.This is a very good teacher of his field, which happens to be perhaps the most explosive field of this time."
4,"Excellent, but...","This book will satisfy your needs to study network programming on Posix subsystems in the C language. An abundance of examples are exposed in a method whereby each example has a new concept to teach about network programming tactics, in accordance with C. I must however subdue to the fact that his wrapper functions are annoying, however they are useful in illustrating the importance of better workarounds for various functions and tasks. If you're looking to learn network programming, this book is obliged to be on your bookshelf."
5,"Great introduction to sockets, invaluable reference.","Whether you're new to unix socket programming or you're a seasoned veteran, this book and it's companion (Volume 2) should be on your shelf.Stevens, as usual does a brilliant job of explaining the fundamental concepts without confusing the reader.If you're interested in developing well writen client/server apps, BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,not that satisfied,"The book sent to me is not volume 1 , but volume 2. But I need the volume 2 too.But sending the wrong volume is not good"
3,"Its okay, although it has its downfalls.","The book is jam packed full of useful information, but when it comes down the the programming examples, he writes almost all of his code using wrappers, or functions he has written to make the code portable from OS to OS. The wrappers make it very hard to learn and understand, and the book is written more from a networking stand point rather than programming."
3,Lacks critical engineering areas...,"After reading this book, I found my self stuck in a world where R. Stevens controlled how I should write network programming. He deviates slightly from the core foundation of network programming on ALL UNIX systems, and most of his 'example' code only worked on Solaris and BSD. Porting it to standard OS's that are becoming more common everyday, like Linux was a nightmare. On top of that he lacks the engineering aspect of coding. For example there was no detailed information about how to handled ROUTED packets, nor how to break down a packet to extract information out, much like a sniffer does. Considering there is not much in the way of network programming books, I have to give him credit for at least making a book, however I wasn't all that pleased."
5,awesome book! definitely is helping me relearn (for good) unix networking,"been programming for close to 15 years, dabbled in this stuff when I was 17-19 but never really learned it well -- relearning it now for good -- very solid technical book and none of that crap you'll find in other tech books -- if you want to learn how to scale your website properly read this"
5,A must have for any UNIX programmer.,"This book is essential to the success of any UNIX network programmer, and covers such otherwise obscure topics as asyncronous I/O multiplexing. A great buy for your money."
5,HELP FOR SPIRITUAL COUNTER-ATTACKS,"An excellent study of Satan's Kingdom and how it operates. Very helpful for Ministers, Intercessors, or anyone involved in Spiritual Warfare. It helped us overcome the enemy's counter-attacks."
1,"Good topic, poorly organized","Walid Shabbat has an important story to share and a great deal of knowledge to impart. Unfortunately this book is too poorly organized to be able to read it easily. I also purchased his other book, GOD'S WAR ON TERROR, which basically shares much of the same information and a great deal more in a well-written, easily read format. GWOT also better reflects the author's speaking style and his wit. I highly recommend GOD'S WAR ON TERROR above WHY I LEFT JIHAD."
1,A Murky Maze,"This is one of the most irrational, convoluted books I have ever come across. Did this author not have an editor?? Even a deep interest in the subject did not help when trying to wade through the murky waters of Shoebat's writing. Fair warning: only the first two chapters have any biographical content. The primary emphasis of chapters 3 through 17 is biblical prophecy with unproved assertions offered as truth. Unfortunately, Shoebat offers the reader nothing more than a disputation masquerading as scholarship."
4,Good information,"There is a lot of excellent information - quotes from various sources, excerpts from the Koran, etc. - but I had expected a somewhat different book. I thought it would be about his experiences as a terrorist, what the terrorist organization was like from the inside, and his effort to remove himself from it. It really is a book about what Islam really is and then a long part at the end is an interpretation of End Time references in the Bible. There is nothing personal in the book."
2,book Why I left Jihad: Walid Shoebat,"I felt there was much information for those who have a more detail oriented mind. However for my self the other book I purchased, ""God's war on Terror"" by the same author is much better suited for me. It is easy reading, and just as informative. Just not as long winded about a each subject."
3,Topic is interesting but POORLY written - get another editor,"No argument about what he writes, pretty much the same view as found in Sword of the Profit....However as pointed out by another reviewer. Walid's writer NEEDS A WRITER. I don't think there is a complete thought thread on one page. The book is a jumble of unconnected paragraphs. The poor writing makes what could have been a more compelling presentation - a real annoyance to read."
