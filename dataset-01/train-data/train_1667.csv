3,Bristles seems engineered to fail quickly,"Remember when you didn't need to replace your toothbrush every 12 weeks? It's almost a certainty that the hype about frequent brush replacement was started by the companies that make them. And Oral-B seems to further manipulate their customers into a steady stream of cash by engineering these brushes to go badly quickly. Within a couple of months use, the bristles on these brushes completely wear out, far quicker than one would expect or than used to happen on their old brushes. My best guess is that they design these things to deteriorate at a rapid pace to make more money. While the power toothbrush works quite well, just be aware that buying these things pretty much locks you into a regular brush replacement regimene that will cost a family of four over $100 a year."
1,.,"I don't think it's orginal german made orall-B,becuase it comes with package that is not from Oral-B,like other think,this is freaky chinese and is not orginal!don't buy that."
3,You get what you pay for!,"Well, this is the 1st time I've bought my replacement brush heads on line. And YES, they are ALOT cheaper than the store, but the brush is a little looser than the ones I buy in the store.I will still use these, but it difficult when it vibrates more than its suppose to. I am a little disappointed, and don't know if I will buy these again."
4,excellent and affordable brush heads,"I have had a hard time finding replacement brush heads for my Oral B power toothbrush. So glad Amazon had them. They are economical, work great and make my dental hygienist very happy because they clean so well."
4,"Great product, but use gently","i've been a regular flosser and brusher for several years, to the delight of my hygentist (and myself). Recently I bought the oral-b brush replacement 3pack and began adding it to my evening teeth cleaning. After a few weeks I noticed tenderness in some of my gums. I began brushing as usual, omitting the oral b, and the pain subsided. I think maybe I was pressing too hard, as if I were brushing with a manual toothbrush. I like the feeling of the oral b cleaning, but, as in all oral care, be careful not to brush too hard or you'll do damage to get that amazing clean feeling!"
4,bad company,do not buy good products from a bad company. They sent the wrong brushes and after 3 calls and them lying we still did not receive the right product.
2,Pool Quality,They came with pool quality. the package was damaged and looks like so cheap and coming from very old inventory.
1,Doesn't even fit,"I ordered this item from the seller shown above, but got it from different seller (Mr. Bargain). The description says '3 refills'. The package I got had 4 refills, and none of them could fit my professional care toothbrush."
1,Not Above The Fray,"These brushes start to fray after a few uses. They are labeled as an Oral-B product, but do not possess theOral-B quality."
4,Price is good;more vibration,Good price; somewhat louder and more vibration than the original. No instructions for use of rubber washer included.
3,Disappointed in California,"I was reading Kate's other book, Here When You Need Me, and enjoyed it so much I wanted to read more of her writing but was disappointed with the flavor of Onion which is the story of a baby and her wanderlust mother. It wasn't as easy to read and seemed to center on odd imaginings that distracted me. I finally closed the book halfway through and am giving it to our local library. Maybe someone else will find it more interesting than I did."
2,Sour Grapes!,"This lady cannot resist savaging people she feels did her wrong. And like many people on the far right, there is a very dysfunctional home life. I swear to you, the Rush Limbaughs, the Newt Gingriches, the Tom DeLays all have had super unhappy childhoods. Maybe this is why their politics are so sour and anti-people.I don't like this lady - she took advantage of affirmative action whenever she could in her youth, now she has some problems with it and would like to throw the whole program out the door SO NO ONE ELSE CAN BENEFIT FROM IT. She makes me ill."
1,Another Republican Lawn Jockey,"Yes, another hardscrabble rags to riches tale with the travails of surviving as a minority in America as a skeletal framework for this tidy bit of propaganda. Unfortunately, Chavez is just another garishly painted figurine placed on the front lawn of the right wing's agenda, along with co-lawn jockeys Ward Connerly and Dinesh D'Souza."
3,Trouble's Daughter,"This little book tells the compelling story very loosely based on a true story of a young girl taken from her family and forced to live among a local American Indian tribe. While it does not give vivid details of everyday life it does provide a feeling for how the Indians lived in the New York area. It also shows that the Indian could be compassionate to captives. It would be a better book if more details of live and the struggles of a white captive to hold on to their faith and sanity. Susanna Hutchinson goes on to become a significant character in American history, especially New York history."
3,This Isn't Entirely Fiction,"This book is labeled as ""fiction"", but the entire storyline actually happened. Susannah Hutchinson, one of my ancestors, WAS kidnapped by the indians after her mother and brothers and sisters were massacred. The author simply changed a few names here and there; the fiction is derived mostly from what the author imagines Susannah's four years with the indians might have been like. The actual indian tribe that took her was the Siwanoy and it is true that when they agreed to return her, she wanted to remain with the tribe. In fact, she had trouble remembering the English language. I have no problem with this book, but I believe children should look up the REAL story and discover a piece of our country's actual history. I loved the comments on how this plotline is not very original. Perhaps someone should have told that to the indians back in 1643 and they would have spared the whole family."
2,Slightly more visible at night...,"I bought this ball for ""Saturday Night Soccer,"" which me and my friends play weekly. Now that winter is here, the nights of course get darker earlier, and we needed a brighter ball to help us play. This ball seemed quite bright, and it was cheap, so I bought it. We're kind of disappointed in it.The group is split between whether they like this ball, or our old ball more in terms of feel. Some claim this ball is lighter and flies around more... I don't really notice a difference.As for visibility though, which is why we bought it, yes, this ball is slightly more visible at night because it's orange, but it by no means glows or anything like that.Overall, we're disappointed.Ball = FAIL."
3,Great Pictures But Beware,"This camera takes very good pictures and all the extra functions it has are great. But the 3800 does have some problems. My second Fuji 3800 camera died last weekend, worked great, then turned it on and the viewfinder and lcd screen is so fuzzy you can't make out what you are seeing, if you take a picture, the colors are all messed up and it has (video) lines thru the picture when viewed. My first Fuji 3800 camera worked great, until one day I turned it on and it decided it would turn it's self off and never would power up again. The camera worked so good, I had topurchased another one (I had extra lens and cards), the 1st camera lasted a year and I did take over 6000 pictures with it, the 2nd only lasted 6 months (2000 pictures). May be I over worked them. But be aware they do have problems. I am puchasing a Fuji s3100 and hope it will last longer than the 3800, like I said, they took great pictures. But I would not purchase another 3800."
4,Very good camera with an amazing optical zoom,"This is a very good camera for the price. This is very true that it has troubles autofocusing in the low light conditions. However, I found that changing angle helps in very many cases. I love manual/""advance"" controls. They helped me take great pictures in different situations. This camera is the best for outdoor shots. Zoom works just great.If you take many of indoor pictures and hate manual controls - get a Cannon Elph (just 2X zoom). Otherwise this is as good as it can get"
3,"Barrel Distortion, Dim viewfinder","I was disappointed with the amount of barrel distortion visible in prints made with meduim to wide angle zoom settings. Not for architecture.While the TTL/SLR design is appealing, the TTL viewfinder is dim in low light. The viewfinder image also becomes much sharper in the freeze frame after shooting than while composing.A decent camera, but a bit overpriced for the above level of quality."
2,Think it over,"I was happy with the picture quality, the 6x/3.2x zoom, and the ease of use but, I returned the camera. The viewfinder is USELESS in low light so indoor shots can be tough. Even with the viewfinder's brightness turned all the way up I could barely see what I was trying to photograph."
2,"Great pix, really flimsy body","OK. You want great pictures from a camera, right? You'll get them with this one. But there's something else a really good ... camera should deliver. A good, solid feel in your hand. It's almost TOO light. The entire camera is PLASTIC and has the feeling of a disposable. This would be a 5 star PLUS camera if the body were titanium and it had a bit more heft. I wouldn't reccomend this camera to a friend. I KNOW there are more solid cameras out there. Look for them and don't but this one."
2,Horrible choice,"I just got this camera and It isnt what I expected it to be. The weird shape makes it hard to grip and if you aren't using the flash youre pictures get fuzzy. The worst part about this camera is the software. It takes up a chunk of your hard drive but bassically only crops your photos. I suggest getting Adobe Photoshop for digital cameras, you can download it off of Kazaa. The memory card is cool but it only comes with a 16 MB card which only stores about 8 photos. This camera EATS batteries for breakfast, I had to get rechargables. After all of the accessories you need to buy are added on to the total price it comes out to around $ dolars. Get a canon or olympus, they're much better quality"
5,Great camera!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Love my camera, it takes the greates pictures even it your not a professional. I love the video also. The quality is excellent and mine was refurbished."
5,The best camera ever,I just got this camera and it is awsome! The 6x optical zoom is great and it also has 5 different modes. The pictures turn out just as good as my old film camera. It is very simple to use and it is a good energy conserver. If your looking for a good quality digital camera with a good zoom and great quality get this one. Plus it has a movie mode! Get this....Trust ME!
1,Unhappy customer,"I purchased a Fuji 3800 last year because it seemed like great value for money. Like many things that seem too good to be true, it was. Almost exactly a year after purchase, in which it was used sparingly, the camera went dead - it just would not turn on. By the time I got it to a repair center, the 1 year warranty period was over. The estimated repair cost including tax is $150 - I can get a decent new 3.2 MP camera for that price these days.While it lasted, it took decent photos. The 6x zoom which was a big selling point of the camera was fairly useful. Focusing in low light was difficult. Overall it felt too light and plasticky. With the breakdown, I'll never buy a Fuji again."
1,maybe I am just too amature but I think this camera stinks,"I love to take pictures. But after buying this camera I find it to be a big hassel. All my pictures turn out dark, whether I am indoors and I am using the flash, or if I am outdoors on a sunny day. I have to edit all my pictures and make them brighter. Another problem I found is it takes the picture too slow. I have several pictures of my dog that are blurred because of movement. I even went out to dinner with a bunch of friends and was so frustated with the quality of picture it was taking that I stopped taking pictures (which is odd for me since I normally and the picture taking freak of the group). I had previously purchased a Kodak Easyshare 4 MP Digital Camera and returned it so that I could buy a camera with a better optical zoom. I wish I would of kept that camera it worked so much better then this one."
5,This is a great camera.,First of all the camera is extremely easy to use. I think I spent about 5 minutes with the directions before I was off taking pictures. You will need to get a larger memory card if you plan on taking this on trips. I am using a 128mb card right now and I have yet to fill it up! Battery life is great. The only downside has been mentioned in other reviews. The electronic viewfinder goes black in low light conditions. So if you are taking flash photos in the dark you have to wing it. For 99% of the pictures you take this will not be a problem. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking to get into digital photography.
5,Love this camera,I was reluctant to buy this camera because I love Minolta and Sony products and wanted something from one of these brands. The salesperson that I bought my computer from steered me toward this camera and eventually sold me on it. I am soooo glad that I listened to him because I LOVE this camera. It takes wonderful pictures. I get tons and tons of compliments on my photos when I email them and print them. I wouldn't trade this camera for anything. Fuji is a new favorite brand for me!!
4,Great entry level or gener al use camera for the price,"I got this about a year ago and have used it to record all of my children's development. My family is a long way off so I need to take lots of pic's & send them home to Grandma & Grandad. This camera consistently takes great photos! I have blown some up to 8X10 and they still look good enough to frame & display (even at 2MP setting, never mind 3mp Fine). As I said I use it a lot and have never had a single problem with it. It has a good feature range (most of which I don't even use never mind understand!).If you are looking for a great entry level digital camera that takes great pictures and is very easy to use I recommend it highly.The only comment I would have is that it is NOT a pocket camera. You will have to carry it around in a fanny pack or case of some sort which is not a big deal from my perspective!"
3,Fujifilm FinePix -,"I was really excited when I purchased this camera because of the 6x's optical zoom and the price, which varies, was resonable. I loved the features and the zoom level and thought the quality of the pictures was very good. I was however, very unhappy with the shutter speed in this camera and as I took pictures of my (active)children noticed a big difference in the freeze frame shot and the actual picture saved to my card. I gave it a couple of weeks to get comfortable and experiment with all of the settings/features and ended up returning the camera. I don't know if anyone else had this problem...maybe I had a defective camera...but it turned out not to be what I was looking for."
4,Decent Camera,"1. This camera does make you work for your exposure and shot in low light conditions. You simply need to use the flash, and sometimes that means craking it up to F 8.2 and ev up to .6 off. If you are willing to do that, excellent shots are possible in low light.2. Really nice camera overall -- great image quality and so on.3. the optical zoom is great and distinguishes the camera4. if you have a notebook handy, the 16 mb xD card is fine. Just download it.5. consistently good shots for am amateur photographer -- I'm happy and impressed"
3,Good value,"Pros:6x zoom is great.lens is fast.macro works very well.easy to handle.good value.Cons:auto-focus battles with combinations of foreground and background items (no spot focus, or focus-lock).struggles even more at night-time.viewfinder is useless in the dark.can be slow when using the flash.bulkier than some of the competition.Overall:The 6x zoom and good macro make up for most of the problems, but for my next camera I'll be looking for better focusing and night-time performance."
1,FujiFilm 3800 Died,"After 28 months it quit working, factory wants $86.00 to fix....no more Fuji products for me!!"
1,No power after 1 year,"We purchased the camera a year ago, it wasn't used a lot and now it won't power up at all. What a pile of crap, we also have a minolta, and will never buy Fuji again!!"
1,3800 - a very flawed product,"If you are only going to take pictures on sunny days, by all means buy this camera. However, if you are like most folks who often take pictures on overcast days or need to use a flash in low-light conditions - forget this camera! On overcast days, the camera often indicates that there is too little light for hand-held pictures. And when it is dark enough to warrent using the flash, the camera's auto-focus can't operate, resulting in brighly illuminated out-of-focus photos. A call to Fuji technical support about this problem was a waste of time. This is a very flawed product."
1,Very Poor Choice,"I was previously very interested in this camera. However, after using it for a time, it has been very possibly a nearly useless camera. The autofocus is poor at best, the movie is only 320x240 max, and less than 30fps.There is also a considerable delay in taking pictures, as the autofocus has a meeting someplace inside the camera to discuss if there is any point in focusing on anything in particular!There are many better choices, not to mention the Finepix S7000!"
3,"Clunky, but nice pictures","Ok, bought this camera about 5 years ago. It still is alive through all the beatings we have given it. It takes nice clear pictures, but because there is a long delay in the shutter speed (FPS), we've lost some nice moments. for example, try getting a toddler to pose and smile--but by the time the image was captured in the camera, the kid is now in the next room. this requires patience!"
2,Beware,"I got this camera a couple of years ago for my birthday. It worked great for about two years and then it just went dead! It wouldn't power on at all no matter what we did (fresh batteries, etc.) I took it to a camera repair shop and they said that it would cost more to fix it (if they could even do that) than to buy a new one. I see by the reviews of others that it is a common problem. I was planning on getting another, but was sort of leary about it. Now I will DEFINATELY NOT be buying another like this!"
1,My Finepix just died too,"The same as the above posters, our camera just died...I think fujifilm should recall this camera due to it just stopping to work. What now a $300 paperweight? Was an excellent when working."
1,Nice While it Lasted,"Bought the 3800 in autumn of 2003. It worked well for about 3 years. I liked the audio with video feature, design, ease of use and reasonable quality of pictures, though it was always super sensitive to movement and many pictures blurred. During this time, I easily shot over 4000 pictures. It began to flake out sometime last summer or autumn with the black screen described by many others and now it just refuses to turn on.I don't think that I will purchase a Fuji again, for a while at least, but purchase a Canon next.Note that I still have a Pentax SLR 35-mm camera that I bought in the 1970s, which cost about $400 at the time. It has travelled / backpacked through Europe, Africa, Tibet and China as well as the US Sierras and Rockies and it still works great, when I want to use a film-camera.Will digital cameras ever last as long?"
1,Ditto-----2 years and out.,"I have had this turkey almost the same length of time as the other one star voters and have had almost exactly the same problems. Flickering in Photography mode and hit and miss correction maneuvers. In a camera used relatively infrequently. A common problem, apparently, ignored by the maker. This dud is now out of date. WHATEVER you do don't buy it used."
4,Very good camera for outdoor use,"I have this camera for 6 month now and never regreted I got it.Optics is really good, zoom works great. Has some problems focusing in low light but I just point and shoot with a flash and in 80% of cases get a good picture. Never needed more resolution as well."
2,R.I.P. Finepix 3800,"This was a great camera while it lasted. We bought ours in Aug. 2003 and it has been everywhere with us. It took very decent pictures and was easy to use. It's a bit bulky. WARNING: our camera recently passed away. We took very good care of it, used rechargeable batteries (the only way to go, etc... but a few weeks ago it just stopped working. I had used it all morning and then it just wouldn't turn on. I've tried recharging the batteries, using different batteries, toggling the switch... nothing works. I hate to think of the hundreds of dollars we spent to ""rent"" this camera for a few years. Technology changes quickly, and there are much better cameras on the market now... but products shouldn't just cease to work for no reason."
2,Not meant to last.,"I got the camera a little over 2 yrs. ago and loved the photos it took. Exactly 26 months later, the camera simply stopped working. The repair center told me it is $150 just to open the camera on the repair bench, PLUS whatever the repair cost will be. I was advised that the cost of repair wasn't worth it and in the long run it's more cost effective just to buy a new camera.Call me crazy but, I think a camera in the price range of $300 and up, should last more that 26 months."
1,Built in failure,"I have owned a Fujifilm 3800 for about 2 1/2 years and loved it, until it stopped powering up. There was no warning, no indication that there was anything wrong, it just stopped. From reading other reviews I can see that this is not an unusual problem. As someone else put it: it stops right after the warranty expired. I cannot afford another camera, so I will go back to using my old standby, the Pentex K1000."
2,it just stopped working,"It just stopped working after like 2 years. My previous camera was my father's, that he used for like 20 years. No problems for him or me.I don't believe cameras should just stop working after 2 years. From looking online it seems it is a common problem but people just expect electronics to have the quality of cars made by GM in the 1970s. Sorry I expect things to work and not just for a short while."
4,"great camera for the price, good customer service from fuji",After a couple months of good performance my camera wouldn't power up. Still under warrenty mailed off to Fuji in NY and got it back the next week with details of repair and they also repaired a cosmetic problem without being asked!great service from Fuji!Only problem with camera is a little slow to cycle pictures but for general snap shots its good.
3,Good for the price,Ok item that gets the job done for the price. A more expensive unit definitly give you a better performance.
3,It works ok....,"I purchased this item a few weeks ago. I think it works ok. This is the first foot spa that i have purchased so my opinion is based on limited knowledge. I think the power pedicure attachment works very well. The water does not stay hot. So i am not sure what the heater does but, i find the unit to be semi-quiet and the bubbles are really cool. I find the unit to be easy to drain and the vibration works well. So for the price i paid i am pleased with the unit."
5,Sorrento 60-ounce small mixing bowl,I bought this bowl to match my set of dishes and I use it to serve salads and fruit dishes. It arrived quickly and was packaged so well. I was very impressed and happy to receive it.
2,disappointed,"I actually ordered 2 bowls at the same time and they each had a different finish on them. One was a bit darker than the other one. One seemed to have more ""antiquing"" on it. I expected them to look the same."
3,Cute Love Story but...,"I bought this film because of Corinna Harney. She was always one of my favorite Playmates. The film was decent.I was mainly interested in the love story.I'm not interested in baseball, so those parts were sort of boring to me.I thought the love story was cute and sweet, but it took way too long for Danny and Melissa to get together.She wasted a lot of years that they could have had as a couple.After she had her baby, she waited like 4 years to see him again.I am puzzled as to why she waited so long.The one thing I thought was unnecessary was all the cursing done by people in the film, none of them the main players. It was totally out of place in a sweet, innocent hopeful love story like this.It was also nice to see Corinna in something recent, especially a lead role.I also wondered if some of the film might have been based on her own experiences.Another reviewer said that she was happily married with two kids now and thats a nice thing to hear."
2,Way too expensive and not worth it.,"Just use a towel. I thought I got a pair of gloves for $25, but they were $25 each! It doesnt clean any better than wiping your dog's feet with a towel."
5,Great Product,"We have 2 new, young, very active dogs who get very muddy. We bought one of these gloves and liked it so much we bought a second. It's great to keep by the backdoor for quick cleanups. The dogs sit and wait for their paws to be cleaned and it's much easier to use than a big towel. It absorbs a lot of mud and water and is very easy to rinse out, dry, and use again. It washes up very well in the washing machine too."
1,RIP OFF - DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this three pack of hose and was sent one pair. I was able to return the pair, but the seller never sent me my three-pack order as they advertised and as per their description. Do not buy from this seller!"
1,uncomfortable and not sized right,"I stretched these pantyhose out in the crotch area before putting them on. On the FIRST TRY, I put my thumb right through the stockings. I was careful but it was hard getting on properly without some tugging. The runner did not prevent me from wearing them that day. it did not run all the way down my leg. i managed to conceal the runner under my skirt. The stockings were uncomfortable too. I do not think these are properly sized for CD. I am 5'4"" and about 145lbs which is on the lower end of the CD scale. WOULD NOT BUY THEM AGAIN! If I could give 0 stars, I would!"
1,NOT A PACK OF THREE,"This item states it is a ""pack of 3"". Much like another reviewer, I only received a single unit. My return shipment has been accepted. The value of this item is significantly diminished by this error, and I am much annoyed by the deception."
2,Fashion Sourcebook 1960's,I expected more of a range of styles in this time period. A bit disappointed.
1,Unless you've been there.,"If you haven't been to Italy, and you're not going, why read this tedious book? It is not for the light-hearted!"
2,How strange this book is!,"Why are all 30 of the entries written by women? What's the point of that? Is this some kind of womens studies book, or what's up with that!"
5,So great and fun to see all these great artists together,"Great Entertainment, makes you smile, get up and dance, sing! Loved every minute of it! Roy Orbison delivers again! Bruce Springsteen is so cute with his contribution to this video"
5,It's JAMES Burton nfm,"The studio, session, Rick Nelson, Elvis Presley guitar wizard is James Burton, not Stephen.His playing is excellent. The whole show is excellent."
5,Wonderful,"Wonderful to see the concert in black and white, (not filmed in color), giving it a feeling of being in a period piece. There seems to be an unusual Hollywood vibe going around the audience and indeed it actually was filmed at the Coconut Grove in Los Angeles."
4,Concert from a great artist,"Roy Orbison was an excellent singer and this concert is a great one. RIP, Roy. We miss you."
5,"Roy Orbison, B & W",Well done. I saw portions of B&T on TV a year ago and was happy to find it available at Amazon. The session provides a feeling of being in a Chicago night club in the 60s. Cool memories. Great music. Good gift idea.
3,Roy the Boy is great,"I saw the previous black and white concert on PBS, and franklin I was dissapointed in the B&W; Blue Ray version.Perhaps its meant to be in Color, but I saw little difference in Blue Ray than the original concert.Still, the sounds and the performance was vintage Roy Orbison"
4,Key performance,"Filmed all in black and white, this is a non-commented recording of the performance only. Roy plays the usual songs and is backed-up by a star-studded cast of Roy's fans. Too bad that Bruce Springsteen keeps trying to take the limelight. Wikipedia has an excellent write-up."
5,One the best Blu ray I have,"Excellent,I don't stop to hear this dvd blu ray..The musics are amazing.Spetacular and delicious to hear."
5,The Best,This is the best jam session ever recorded. I have to order more for the family so I can have my copy at home when I want to watch it. I recommend this to anyone who loves good music.
3,Almost the same as the DVD,"As good as the DVD version, didn't notice much difference from the DVD version, since I got it really cheap, it was a good deal!"
4,"Great Video, but....","DVD set was as advertised. Arrived promptly, and well within the time frame. Just a shame this old coot (me) didn't understand ""DVD Audio"". Make sure you do and have the capability to play it (a DVD Audio player)before you order it! I Didn't, so that disk in the set is currently worthless to me."
5,Best music DVD I ever saw.,Can you give something 6 stars? Just absolutely the best music DVD I ever saw.
5,Great Concert,"This really is a great concert. If you're a fan of the Big O, this should be in your collection. My 83 year old uncle and I had an exciting discussion about the concert after I told him I was going home to watch it... again. We spent the next half hour talking about the talent, the Coconut Grove, the smoke wafting about, the cigarette girls walking through the crowd, and k.d. lang getting into it as the concert progresses. You gotta love seeing musicians enjoying themselves and they all are."
5,Blak and White Nights,Exceptional! What a classic. A collection of outstanding performers supporting Roy Orbison (one of a kind) in an intimate environment. Captivating. I have watched it 3 times already and anticipate many more viewings.
5,Roy out did himself on this concert.,"I was very impressed by the video. Not only did Roy shine throughout the show but, he also shed a big spotlight on his guest musicians. His closing number,""Oh Pretty Woman"", was a complete knockout. He let Bruce Springsteen, James Burton, Elvis Costello and all the rest have a first class jam session on this number. My family and I loved every minute of it."
5,True Tribute to Roy Orbison,"Quite possibly the last great tribute of the late Roy Orbison, this one night only musical masterpiece features some of the greatest musicians of the time. As a sign of respect, some of the greats like Bruce Springsteen, Jackson Browne, Elvis Costello, and even Elvis' touring band got together to perform some of the great hits of Roy Orbison's catalog. What a treat it turned out to be. Perfectly mixed and produced, this great show would have been an honor to attend. Wish I could have been there....."
5,Roy Orbison - Black & White Night,Special and incredible program. I got this for my Mom who raved about it for about 5 minutes.
5,Just like being there,"Format: SACD/DVDI put the SACD in the player set up for multichannel, dimmed the lights, leaned back in the chair, closed my eyes and I was THERE! It is so clear. This is one helluva concert that is a shining example of just how good multichannel SACD can be. Roy Orbison's music spans the decades and is as relevant now as it was all those years ago. I couldn't stop myself from 'bopping with the beat'. Highly recommended if you are a fan."
4,One Glorius Night.,Roy is at the top of his game and the supporting cast is as star studded as it gets. I bought the HD DVD version... simply great. I did not give it five stars because there were were more than a few out of focus shots. They really show up in HD on a very large display.After enjoying this you just have to wish all the great artists of the 50s and early 60s could have got at least one live performance of this caliber down for future generations to remember. Sadly so little of what is out there is not recorded in a way that is suitable for high quality transfer to the new high definition video and audio formats.
5,Roy and the Boys rock,"One of the best sessions ever. Great sound, great voice and what a load of fantastic talent to enjoy time and time again. Roy does the hits and there are no misses. And what a great backing band. This DVD should be in every music collection and one day I will have the Blu-ray version as well!!!!"
5,I've seen the video 4 times and love it all the more!!!,"It's the greatest! Roy is my very favorite singer in the world and ""FRIENDS"" just gave it an additional big PLUS!!!!!!"
3,Shoot the Soundman,"OK... great band, Roy is in TOP form and is blessed with James Burton as one of his guitarists... obviously admired by him and the rest of the band as well. So where is he in the mix? NOWHERE!!! Seems to me, someone in charge spent more time on video quality than audio. Is this about the music, or not? I own the VHS of this performance as well, and overall, the I feel the VHS sounds better."
5,Surround Sound Amazing,"Wonderful! For those with DVD player optical-to-surround capability, the mix is amazing. You're in the band! I hear something new every time I play it."
5,DVD - Orbison,Just as I remembered it. This is one that you can enjoy listening/watching over and over again. Live performance gave lots of opportunity for the musicians to just jam and have fun.
5,Roy Orbison - A Black & White Night - DVD,For anyone who is a fan of Roy Orbison this DVD is a must.The incredible amount of talent on stage is beyond belief.
4,amazing!!!,Well this dvd is worth buying.. the sound quality is amazing...the man is a genius... and this is a MUST to anyones collection...what more can i say...!!!
5,Seeing it live didn't look and sound this great!,"The DTS is absolutely brilliant whether you are an Orbison fan or not, it is hard to top this spectacular recording. A nice collection of Orbison's masterful style enhanced with a superstar ensemble performing with him. The six channel sound is crisp, clear and makes viewing this on my home theatre system well worth owning this dvd. The video is obviously b&w which adds an artistic mystique to the whole performance which is enhanced by the lighting and film artifact that is added to the video. The picture is awesome with camera shots that make you feel like a special part of this event. This will remain one of the crown jewels of my dvd collection."
5,"simply amazing, i dont think this concert will ever be topped by anybody",best concert bluray i own.the first few seconds you here this concert your jaw will be dropped an stunned in amasement all the way to the end. its that good.i dont think this concert will ever be topped by any performer.5 stars from almost 300 reviewers says it all.its got dts-ma bitstream on it as well as dts an dolby digital. the recording dont get any better than this.
5,Outstanding,Bought this to replace my old DVR tape of this show. It is outstanding and I would recommend to any Orbison fan.
2,Roy Orbison Black & White Nights,"Bought the Blue Ray to replace my older DVD. Older DVD has much better quality and more interactive information. Bio's on all the ""Friends"" which are on the DVD have been removed from the Blue Ray Edition. Boooooooo!!!!"
5,Outstanding DVD,"I've watched this concert many times on PBS and decided to get my own copy so I don't have to endure the pledge breaks. It's simply one of the best concert videos ever made. Imagine having backup musicians like Bruce Springsteen, kd lang and Bonnie Raitt, among others. And they all seem to be having such a good time with Orbison's simple but beautiful songs."
4,All-Star Cast,Great video of Roy Orbison's songbook. A real neat item for any music afficianado as there are a number of musicians both on stage and in the crowd that were popular at the time this video was made!
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I'm a 47 year old music buff and I've never paid much attention to Roy. I saw this video on Public TV and sent in a pledge for $50.00 to get it. This guy could hit at least 3 octaves and had perfect pitch. I believe he was the most under-rated artist of the century. The backup singers are all stars in their own right but were all mentored by Roy. Springstein is good in his ""clean cut"" mode. Every music fan from country to classical should love this - Put it out in DVD.We're ordering 2 extras.Bob Weissert"
3,dvd-audio vs blu-ray version,"I bought this primarily for the dvd-audio that turned out to be disappointingly mediocre when compared to the blu-ray that I had acquired sometime ago. The blown up picture of the dvd made it difficult to see what the dvd-audio had been transferred at. I had high hopes but they were dashed once I heard it. So for those with a blu-ray player or even a dvd-audio player, pass on this version of Black & White and get the blu-ray, assuming that you can play it. It always seems to be a bit odd that once something like this is purchased from Amazon, that Amazon then drops the price and in this instance by $7! When this dvd with the dvd-audio was first released, it was probably on top of the world, but not now. This is another one of those cases in which the normal dvd costs more than the blu-ray and is certainly not worth it."
1,Black & White Night DVD,Not worth the money. Can't hear the individual featured musicians over the background music. Not what we expected as Roy Orbison fans.
4,"Good, but not truly great","I love Roy Orbison, so I was really looking forward to this DVD. In the end, however, I was disappointed. All those great musicians and only one song (Pretty Woman) where they really open up and jam. One of the all-time best songs (in my opinion) is the duet between Roy and k.d. lang on Crying from the earlier CD 16 Greatest Hits. In the DVD version, however, k.d. stays in the background and we don't get to hear that amazing harmony of their voices. Don't get me wrong, this is a marvelous DVD. It could have been truly great and that is the missed opportunity. I'll bet the practice sessions were much more memorable."
1,Orbison Black and white,I had to return this DVD audio disc since it would not play on two different DVD audio players. I was very disappointed since I am sure the content would have been great.
2,Compare to the Laserdisc,"Please try to compare this version with the previously issued Laserdisc and you will find this new DVD has been overdubbed on the drum sections and the guitar sections featuring Bruce S. have been toned down to lose their vitality. If you have not owned and listened to earlier versions, pls do so before this purchase."
5,simply stupendous,"I first saw this DVD on public TV as an enticement to donate. What a great investment. Roy's voice and songs are unique and hopefully will live on indefinitely through this CD and DVD. When I'm home alone and can crank up the sound on the DVD and watch and listen to Roy and friends it is almost spellbinding. I can't get enough of the ""girls"" as backup. Bruce is great (he seems like a baby almost)....totally in awe of Roy and James Burton...who seems to be the White of ""Black and White""...what a plucker he is. When in the car, the CD carries me through until I can watch the DVD again.I own many CDs and DVDs but watch/listen to these two the most...over and over!!!"
5,Black and White Night,"I wish I had purchased this DVD ten years ago. The music is fantastic and it is a shame Roy passed on. Thanks to k.d.lang, we can see this great concert again."
4,Better than expected,"Only purchased this as it was cheap. What a great concert. Was not a great fan of Roy's but this has certainly changed my mind. The who's who of entertaining in the background vocals, makes you realise just how old this concert is. Sounds fantastic."
5,ROY ORBISON DVD (A BLACK & WHITE NIGHT),Great show!!! I originally got this at a thrift store. A friend saw it and wanted to buy it off of me. I wouldn't let him. I got on Amazon.com and of course found a copy at a reasonable price. This show has alot of musical artists that you will recognize from both rock and roll and country charts of the past. I enjoy putting this in my dvd tv at bedtime.
1,unreal,Mr. Hyde set me on the right path. With the proper equipment this DVD is better than the show i was at. I'm hearing sounds and parts i did not hear at the show. BUY THIS NOW!!!!!
5,Back to Rock and Roll,Great video for those of us near 60 who remember the greats of Rock and Roll. Great tunes and great sound! Highly recommended.
5,Great album,"This is one of the greatest concerts in the World. Greatest artists and great songs, black and white is a very appropriate mood and make this one of the best videos in history. The DVD also has 3 sound system for your selection: stereo, dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1. Pretty Woman is one of best rock songs in the rock history."
5,A great performance by a great entertainer,This could be the greatest backup band ever assembled to support one of the greatest entertainers ever. Even my father-in-law who dislikes rock and roll on principle thought that this was well worth the time. (He wants a copy of the video for Christmas.) If you like Roy Orbison you should have bought this already!
5,Roy Orbison DVD Black & White Night,Excellent DVD even if you are not a Roy Orbison Fan! One hit right after another with several back up players you will recognize.
1,Roy Orbison,It wasn't clear about which DVD to order and I made the mistake of ordering the HD and I can't play it on my machine. Watch the one you order.Jim
5,highly entertaining,I enjoyed this DVD very much. It was so interesting to see KD Lang and Jennifer Warnes and Bruce Springstreen so young. It shows a great deal of Roy's personality too. I will watch it again and again!
5,Roy Orbison: A Black and White Night,"I bought this music video for my 16 yr old son, who is a guitarist and loves music. He shared it with us and it is an incredibly moving musical experience. I recommend it to anyone who loves music."
2,"Yeah, ew.","This lip balm is awful. Smells bad, like medicine or something. The consistency is really thick and awful as well. You can't even really spread it on. Did nothing for my lips. One of the worst lip balms I've tried in a while and I buy new ones all of the time; I probably go through about 10 new brands a month. Seriously bad product people."
3,Does the job,It's a bit bulky and the adapters seam to pop out easy. Other than that it did a good job of switching and passing along the optical signal.
1,Don't waste your money on Junk,"This item does not work well. Rather than having an input right in the unit, one must use an adapter included with the item. The build quality is very poor and the adapters fall off of the optical cables and if the cable twists signal cuts out."
3,Great unit for the price,"I bought this unit because I do not have enough optical inputs on my receiver. It accomplished it's purpose for a relatively low price. However you have to get up and manually change the switch for the device that you are using. With my receiver t was quite cumbersome because I also had to change the video device that the recever was assigning to the optical port. After hours and hours of research I also purchased a ""copperbox"" that also switches the video with the audio. This is a more expensive option but for my purposes it was worth the extra money. I am still going to use the Recoton product for an input that the Video does not pass through the receiver."
1,Disappointed,"The adapters make this product non-functional for me. With some wiggling I could get sound to flow through the device, but cables were too loose to maintain the signal if it were bumped or even after switching to another input. If the inputs were to simply take the full size optical plug, I suspect this device would work fine (in fact several other options seem to do just that and I'll probably order one of those, next).The adapters don't snap very tight, either. They pop off of the cables easily and made it very hard to debug the problem. Just disappointing!"
4,simple and effective,"This couldn't be a simpler approach to a switch for a dolby digital signal, and it works very well. Only complaint is the bizarre adapters required for normal size cables, which are included..."
1,"Doesn't work, doesn't hold cables, DO NOT BUY","I purchased this item in June along with 2 digital audio cables, because I already had one cable to use with it. Upon receiving the items, I attempted to connect the various equipment and cables with the switch. To start the new cables worked with it but with my existing cable I had no sound. Now in August, after buying a new cable like the other ones I bought and the switch worked with, the new cable didn't work either and the switch wouldn't hold it, and the ones previously working stopped working. I am returning it! DO NOT BUY! Not worth the money!"
5,Better Than A Trip To The Zoo!,"Harmon, apparently, likes to ""infiltrate"" various groups by giving a false name and adopting a persona which he thinks the group he is trying to join will find acceptable. He then collects information about the group's beliefs, practices, values, and writes up these articles about his experience which are kind of like anthropological reports wherein the author tells about his observations of foreign cultures and his encounters with the natives.Harmon joins a white supremist organization, signs up for the campaign committee of Arnold Schwarznegger, joins the young Republicans, goes to a Christian ex-gay support group, and goes on a weekend retreat with gun loving machine gun shooters.If you are interested in seeing what right wing folks are really like from a left leaning journalist with a skeptical eye then, Republican Like Me, is better than a trip to the zoo.I recommend it."
1,Well done! Technically speaking...,"The copy editing on this book is nothing short of stellar, which is not an easy feat these days. In our technologically evolving world, we are so eager to communicate our message that grammar and spelling get overlooked. The rules are barely even considered anymore (use a semicolon? or a period?). And then when the question of a simple rule comes up, we cannot even remember the answer! For example, did you know you are supposed to use ""me""--not ""I""--after a preposition?Ex. He gave the gift to you and me.Substituting ""I"" for ""me"" violates the rules of grammar. Don't do it. Heather Ammermuller, the copy editor for this book, knows that rule--and all the others, it appears.For more on grammar and its past, present, and future, read EATS, SHOOTS, AND LEAVES by Lynn Truss."
1,Thought I might like it,"What was an intelligent topic and somewhat novel idea was ruined by smug, condescending, get a real kick out of hearing myself, ego. Wow. Didn't make it all the way through. Took a stunning idea from Black Like Me and trivialized it. Next..."
3,Long but lacking,This DVD is three hours long. Lots of music all from the T-Series brand. But almost all of the videos feel like a commercial for the movie instead of dance numbers from the movies. There are four songs on here from one movie that uses all the same movie clips. This gets real boring real quick.
2,Very basic and cheaply produced,"Its a compilation of basic coreographies. May be my mistake, but I did not like it a bit at all"
4,Dense but good,"I've only gotten about a quarter of the way through this book. It has a LOT to offer. It covers lots of different rhythm possibilities while introducing you to various chord voicings and inversions.It will take me a long time to get through this one, but its worth it. Terrific text.This is something more for intermediate players though. If you don't know some basic music theory, you could get lost fast."
1,"Trust me, same yer money....","I have to give the author credit for trying. Obviously the guy put his heart and soul into the book. Also have to give the book credit for presenting alot of theory on chords, progressions, etc. A rhythm guitar book with a CD though should be about the cool grooves themselves. These tracks are definitely NOT that cool. Not worth the money in my opinion (and yes, I have it). Check out the rhythm books by Keith Wyatt and Robben Ford for much more practical and non-lame grooves."
2,"In theory, this could have been a masterpiece - but it isn't","The idea of the book is a great one. You will pick up some chord theory and ideas. Some chord progressions will stick with you. The playing examples are a bit boring for intermediate and up players - there is a lot more spicy blues rhythm guitar out there. Even a few sharp turnarounds would have breathed some more life into the book. More emphasis on timing and fills would have been great too.This book could have been an astonishing, must have book. I hope he goes back with some help and redoes this book into the masterpiece it could be.I also had tons of ordering problems with this book. After I finally got it, the CD was broken and I could not get a return. The original seller offered to sell me the CD for basically the full price of the book and CD. I offered to send the broken CD, receipts, etc - nothing helped."
3,Needs serious re-editing,"I've just started using this book, so I can't comment on its instructional or music value. However, I'm already disappointed in the slapdash quality of the book. There are a number of obvious typos in titles (""dominate"" for ""dominant,"" ""roof"" for ""root,"" etc.) and pages are out of order (the ""Preview"" on page 22 should come before the music on page 21). As others have noted, the track numbers shown on the music pages don't match the CD Track List (""Track 2"" is actually Track 12, ""Track 3"" is actually Track 23). This makes it harder to work with the CD. The book doesn't appear to have been revised since 2004. It's overdue."
3,Very Jazzy,"This is a very good book if your are looking to learn the more jazz side of chord progressions for blues. I have many books on jazzing up the blues, but I was looking for something that was more geared to straight ahead blues rhythms. If you're more interested in the rhythm guitar playing on CDs by people like Stevie Ray Vaughn, Albert King, Freddy King, etc., I would recommend the book, cd, dvd set called Blues Guitar Unleashed. This really is a pretty good book for what it is. I only gave it 3 stars because the cd and book are not in synch. It is poorly put together and if I were the author I would be furious at the publisher."
5,"Extremely Solid, Not for Beginners","This will give you more confidence and a greater understanding of how to construct old-school blues progressions. This book is fairly dense and will require quite a bit of time to ""soak in"". I have found that this book, in conjunction with ""Blues You can Use"" work well in further advancing my blues skill and knowledge base. Not for beginners, and not a book of ""licks you should know""."
3,"Nice, but.....","I just bought this CD. I bought it because I haven't heard some of the songs live before. And it IS extended. But it wasn't as extended as I thought it would be. The Live in Tokoyo CD is much better. This one they don't sound as excited to be playing and there is a lot of bass in the mix. However, it IS good to hear some of the songs live that haven't been played in a while at recent concerts. If you are a Night Ranger nut, then buy it. Otherwise, choose a different Night Ranger CD."
2,Not enough oral histories,"Gives a detailed account of the political and diplomatic manoeuvres between the Western Allies and the USSR, as well as within the US Government during that period. However, it lacked anecdotes on the blockade and airlift, which would have made it a more enjoyable read. Left me wanting more."
1,Poor quality,"Four of the ""teeth"" on the first one I received broke off after the first use. The replacement sent by Amazon ""lost"" two ""teeth"" after the first use. Amazon--Great, Mario Batali--Bad."
2,"Good design, poor quality materials","I own most of these wooden servers that Mario offers, however this particular one the teeth of the server keep coming off. I ordered 1 back in December and a wooden tooth fell off within a week. Amazon replaced it for free and after using it a few times a month since then 3 teeth have fallen off of the replacement. I want another one, however I think I'll have to find another brand as whatever wood is used to make these has problems staying together when carved up to make the pasta server."
2,"curious design, and avoid safecomputing store","strange design not described well on web page. the computer part of the bag is poorly designed, and did not fit my computer, the rest is average.the safe computing company is poorly managed (dont answer phones, etc)and charges a return fee. I would not have purchased from them if the return fee was made clear at the time of purchase, because I do not do business this way. suggest that others beware of this agency"
3,Bad Paint,"All the paint comes off after a short time leaving the cover a bright chrome color. Looks decent, but doesn't have the ""right"" look being the P.O.W. emblem and all..."
3,Buyer Beware: NOT COMPATIBLE with many models,"When I searched for replacement heads for the Oral-B CrossAction Power, this is the product that came up first. The item description states that this product is compatible with all Braun models. However, upon receipt, the package clearly states: DOES NOT FIT: Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete, Pulsonic, CrossAction Power.The packaging says this product IS compatible with Triumph, Professional Care, Vitality+, and ProHealth.I hope this review saves others the aggrevation of returning a product they can't use."
2,"Soft, and that's about it",These brushes are nice and sensitive...but I found that they also clean my teeth poorly. I won't be using them again.
2,Way too expensive,"Love our Oral B Bruan, but think the cost of replacement heads is outrageous. They do a great job but it always pains us to have to buy and replace."
4,Oral B Sensitive Brush for Professional Toothbrush,"This brush is less abrasive than the Precision Clean brush. I like it as a ""break"" from the rougher cleaning. I also have the flosser and polisher brush heads, so I use them all. Also, it gives your gums a break from too much brushing as that can literally brush away your gums. I highly recommend this brush and this seller as I did not see this type in the local stores."
5,Good Product and Good Price,The bristles are soft on teeth and gums and for people who have tender gums that is a must have!
5,Excellent product; just pick this one carefully,"I've used these brush heads for several months now and they do a great job (while still leaving some enamel on my teeth). Amazon shipped them promptly & there were no problems. I've read some unhappy reviews on brush heads that apparently seem to be the same thing, but turn out not to be quite the same. So just be sure that, out of the plethora of brush heads, you choose the genuine Oral-B brand and that they're shipped & sold by Amazon."
5,exactly like in stores,"Love it. Use it on my Braun sonic toothbrush. The brushes are comfortable and last typically around 3 months, which is about as long as you can expect toothbrushes to last."
1,FAKE - spelling on package wrong,"Use the zoom function and look how the word "" convenient "" is spelled. I have seen many fakes before where spelling and punctuation on the packaging is wrong. I have used these fake heads before bought off of Ebay and they do fall apart in your mouth presenting a potential choking problem especially for kids."
5,Oral B Brush Heads,I was afraid I was going to get a cheap knock off versions of the original Oral B Brush Heads as I've seen those before around. But these were the original ones and work as expected on my Oral B 5000 brush handle. The subscribe and save option saves more on these as well.
5,Excellent brushes,My dentist recommended that I use a soft bristle either all of the time or at least >50% so I bought these and they are super to this point. Have not yet been in for a check up but really like them at the moment.
5,Works good,Works just like the one's I pay more for in the store.I have been using it for about two weeks and I have had no problems. I am very satisfied.
2,Cleaning effectiveness: F-. Far inferior to standard brush head,"Purchased direct from Amazon - brushes appeared genuine Oral B, right down to the high price (nearly double what they were 2 years ago!). Appropriate markings and all that.I have used all the brush head types, and thought that ""sensitive"" meant these would be gentle but still effective. Switched to this brush head for a couple weeks. When hubby asked for whitening toothpaste, I noticed that we were both experiencing staining, something that hasn't happened since we've owned a power brush. Thanks to lots of coffee and tea, I can *see* ineffective cleaning before it turns into poor oral health. Threw the sensitive brush heads away and went back to the regular brush heads and our teeth are back to normal now.I would not recommend these for anyone except a brand-new power brush user (for the first brush, while your gums get used to power brushing). If you must use this brush, I would consider switching to the 45-second/quadrant program."
2,pool quality,They came with pool quality. the package was damaged and looks like so cheap and coming from very old inventory.
1,This is NOT sentitive toothbrush heads,This item is not sensitive soft heads.It shows a picture of 4 sets of 3 Oral-B sensitive toothbrush heads but actually not.And it says that List Price:$79.96 You save 79%It looks like they give you a huge discount.But it is only 1 set of 3 Oral-B PRECISION CLEAN.(Not sensitive one.)
3,"They work well, but are too expensive","The sensitive brushes, like the regular ones, work well. But the price is exorbitant. It reminds me of computer printers; they are priced low, but you get stuck paying for them when you buy replacement ink cartridges."
4,Toothbrush Review,"The product finally received was fine. However, company initially shipped me the wrong product. When I contacted the company, they wanted me to incur the cost of returning the product. After complaining to the service rep, the company finally relented and provided me with a prepaid shipping label. After the product was returned, it took another 10 days for the company to send me the correct product. Accordingly, I would rate my overall experience as fair and I am not sure if I would order other products from this company"
4,Definitely different from the floss head,This brush head was definitely different from the one that came with the brush (which was floss brush head)... it's much softer. It's softer than any of the brushes that I have used so far.Only 4-stars as I am not an expert in this area.And Amazon has a great customer service. One of the best that I have seen.
5,Oral -B Sensitive Brush heads,"The Brush heads arrived quickly , they where at a much lower price than the local discount store and they where original Oral-B brushes .What else can you ask for great price , good service and a great product. The Brush heads are soft but not to soft they do a good job cleaning your teeth and add Sensodyne tooth paste you have a winning combination for sensitive teeth . I would order this product from Amazon.com again in a heart beat ."
5,Great !,Great product. It's really soft for my sensitive teeth!! I would buy this again for sure! I recommend this to everyone who has sensitive teeth
5,Soft but effective,"My gums have receded and I have to be very careful what I brush my teeth with. I was very glad to find these extra-soft brush heads for my Oral-B electric toothbrush. They are much ""kinder"" to my gums than other brush heads."
5,Same as more expensive type,"This is the second set I have ordered of these brushes, and I don't think I need to say any more."
5,"Superb brush head, this is the same as the ones sold for youngsters","Though it might not appear so, these ""Extrasoft EB17"" brush heads are functionally the same as the ""children's"" heads sold with various cartoon characters on the package. If you find them listed for about $5 per brush head, that's a good bargain (I've seen 1-2 sold for $18).Note that the standard adult Flexisoft EB17 has dual colors, while the Extrasoft heads are all blue. Ensure that the description states ""extra-soft"" and the illustration is the all-blue bristle head."
1,Not recommended,"Despite the high price, this product has the appearance of a cheap imitation. Presentation and Packaging not as displayed on picture.Amazon: Please check and confirm whether this item is an original part manufactured by Oral-B."
5,High quality brushes,I had tried some of the store-brand brushes and was always dissapointed. These Oral-B brushes cost more but do a better job. I can recommend these brushes.
5,Oral-B Sensitive brush heads,The product is very good. I have lichen plantes in my mouth and this soft brush works best for me. Excellent service.
4,"Great Brush, Great Price","This brush head works well with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and it costs half the price as the same pack at Target. It's a toothbrush, what else is there to say?"
1,"Refurbished Packaging, Not NEW","This came in a non-retail packaging (makes me think it's refurbished) and when attempting to submit for rebate as offered, I received a notification back from Oral-B stating that the UPC code sent in with the rebate form was invalid, despite the fact that it came directly off of the packaging that was sent. The toothbrush is fine and I've used them for years, but Id highly recommend buying elsewhere as clearly they dont care much about Amazon customers."
2,fake product?,"These replacement brush heads are different from the ones that I purchased in the past. When I used them, they felt different. And they are kinda loose when attached to the main brush handle. I suppose these are not genuine Oral B products."
1,Totally not happy with this purchase,This is NOT a genuine Oral-B product!! The whole thing looks discoloring and poor quality!! It was a waste of my time to have to return it.
3,Wouldn't buy again,"The brush head is too small. It takes too long to brush my teeth because there aren't enough bristles. I know that sounds stupid, but it's true."
5,Clear and Informative,"Frost's book continues to be one of the best textbooks on Ancient Greek history. With the author's thorough mastery of the field, clear prose, and attention to social history, the work is a ""must read."""
3,Nice try at all alien story.,"Despite what you might think science fiction tends to avoid writing about aliens. Stories like this that lack human characters are almost more common in film. In fact the dark crystal is the best all alien story I know of & it's a movie. The Encyclopedia of sf makes it sound better than it is. It is okay though. Like Howard Waldrop, & a few others Kelly is primarily a short story writer so that might explain why it's just okay."
4,Only conventional small TV on the market.,"With the advent of HD and wide TV's dominating the market it is just about impossible to find such a small TV.I found the product good. It has a nice picture, however you must watch it at the proper angle otherwise the picture is hard to see. This is the same problem as with many LCD monitors. I only used it with cable input, cannot comment on reception via its own tuner. I have not used it with auxiliary input (i.e. DVD player) so can't comment on that either.The remote had a problem with some of the keys being dead. I had to deal directly with the manufacturer to get it replaced. The new one is O.K.I think it is a good value for the price, although I did prefer my old Sony tube set until it went up in smoke."
3,Not as advertised,"A height/width ratio of 4:3 is NOT ""widescreen."" This is just a standard screen ratio."
4,An TV dinner introduction to the world,"This book is an easy read that will please the palette of both the connoisseur and the economy class traveller. Its short punchy tales takes you from the heart of darkest Africa to the sun baked shores of the paradise called Rarotonga. Light & easy to digest, each story introduces you to the locals as a friend who is accepting of all their foibles. Charles Wooley brings back the true essence of journalism; he extracts the very nature of each culture he visits."
2,Overpriced,"A good toothbrush system, our daughter loves it. Now that we have it why do we have to pay $6 for a refill? that is half the price to purchase the brush.$6 should buy a three pac. We picked your toothbrush for our children Oral B, now that they love it why are you gouging us?"
3,Captive Audience for High Prices,"My daughter loves the princesses and this brush has inspired better brushing ... BUT I feel gouged by the high price of refills. Also I'm finding these specific refills harder to find now that they've come out with their ""new"" princess brush. This is very frustrating. The new brush is much bigger -- too big for small 6-year old mouths and too large for small hands to hold. By the time she's big enough to use it, she'll be out of the princess phase. Braun should at least continue to sell the refills even as they're phasing out the old brush -- otherwise customers feel doubly cheated."
2,Way too much money for a refill,I agree with the other person about the cost. It's ridiculous how much the refill is. My daughter needs to use an electric toothbrush but it doesn't have to be Oral B. I'm going to be looking into another brand that will be more cost friendly in the long run.
5,Lightning fast delivery,I couldn't believe how quickly this order was delivered. Everything is in excellent condition. I will do business with this seller anytime I can.
5,I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH THEM AGAIN .....,"I wasn't able to get this through Amazon - out of stock - but was able to find it on eBay -- AND BOY AM I GLAD!!!!!I listened to it yesterday for the first time. Yes, I was the proud owner of the original vinyl albums (loved that scratch-n-sniff raspberry pint!). I haven't heard some of these songs in over 20 years, but when each song started to play, I remembered the tune, the beat, the words!!!!!!!!! I was in Raspberry Heaven.Love love love love the entire CD. I am so glad I was able to track down a copy. I also have Power Pop 2, but I like this better. The Raspberries were waaaay ahead of their time, but I am so glad I was a fan then, and a fan now.LONG LIVE THE RASPBERRIES. YOU MUST MUST PURCHASE LIVE AT THE SUNSET STRIP - their sound is better than in their hey-day. PURE MUSIC NIRVANA. I can only hope for another reunion tour ...."
1,Poorly manufactured case,"The *design* of the armband and case is well executed, with the case having a nice tactile feel to it. It fits snugly and works well for running.Unfortunately, mine started coming apart in the corners after only about 20 uses.It was just out of warranty when I reported it and so iRiver declined to fix it (even though it started breaking earlier)."
3,Cowboys Necklace,"The necklace is a little larger and a more flimsy than expected. However, if you are only wearing it for game day attire, works perfect."
2,I've read better...,This is one of the weaker End-Times outlines I've read and I've read alot. The info here is poorly put together.
3,"Weak, weak...","Had this album been released by an average metal band, it would probably be the highlight of their career; for MDB, however, this is pretty weak and mediocre. Could it be that they just spoiled me with 4 (!) such outstanding masterpieces in a row (""Swans"" to ""34%"")? The production is horrible! Despite the ocassional sparks of creativity on ""She Is The Dark"", the title track and the quite magnificent ""Sear Me 3"", this is the weakest of their releases so far. Hate to spoil the party."
2,Errr...,This was a huge disappointment cd for me. I hoped that they had evolved a little more than this since the last time. To me this might be the worst MDB album ever. I never listen to it and probably never will again cause it is not half as good as they really used to be. Or..that's not true is it? Cause the next album they created The Dreadful Hours once again put them back on the throne of doom. I guess TLATEOTW was a period where the band really wasn't well enough into what they where making. It seems uninspired and just boring. It pains me to say it though. But all is forgiven..cause the next album was great and the next one coming out ...well today..will be even better. Of course..I would like to hear them do an album like Opeth did like Damnation. Butbut..My Dying Bride does their own thing..I'm happy they are still here.
4,They got back,"After 34.788%, an album that disappointed loads of fans of My Dying Bride, because of the music it had, they are back now, back to the Turn Loose the Swans sound, with heavy guitar riffs and Aaron growling again. 9 master pieces again from My Dying Bride with the title track ""The light at the end of the world"" being one of the greatest from this album, very sad song."
5,the roots are the roots,"Ok, first i want to thank the band for giving us the oportunity to listen again, that glorious sound of ""turn loose the swans"", with great compositions and great concept, simply a masterpiece of gothic-metal-atmospheric album, the power of ""she is the dark"" is something to be heard to be believed, and the rest of the album will take you to another dimension, a must buy for loyal fans, and a perfect experience for the new-coming fans."
4,Get It and Read It,"While reading a book may not be the first thing you think to do when finding yourself unemployed, this is one you SHOULD read as soon as you start packing up your office. Not only does it provide insight and reassurance, but also provides resources to help you determine the next step in your career."
4,Feeling validated,"Being unemployed has been one of my loneliest hours. I felt I had found a friend, and many times my own voice, in this resource. The feelings shared, the actions defined changed my perspective and got me moving. Thank you for your insight and perspective."
1,"The horror, the horror...","We cannot believe this travesty has found its way back into print. All parties involved should have pooled their resources, bought up the rights to it, and made sure this utterly misbegotten project never saw the light of day again.Words fail us in describing the wretchedness of this cynically-conceived, loathesome processed cheese-food music product. ""Sgt. Pepper"" destroyed a number of careers; Peter Frampton is still scarcely detectable on radar, and the Bee Gees haven't exactly made a roaring comeback. Aerosmith was probably going through the worst of their druggie fog, and thus inadvertently provided the lone highlight of this album. But there's no excuse that can possibly make George Burns' singing ""Fixing a Hole"" right. None."
4,Great Music,"This is a great album. Peter Frampton & The Bee Gees, I enjoyed it better than the Beatles recording of the same, who knew George Burns could rock"
2,Nostalgia isnt what it used to be...,"It boggles the mind that people are giving this dog positive reviews. The two best songs( Aerosmith's version of Come Together and Earth, Wind and Fire's remake of Got to Get You into my Life) are certainly available on those group's best of collections. The rest ranges from decent to embarassing.Unless you want a musical record of the film that more or less brought Peter Frampton's career to a skidding halt, you may want to avoid this one. (Side note: the film is even worse than the soundtrack....a disjointed series of sketches to allow the cast to sing the above Beatles numbers)."
1,Ugh!,"Whoever thought Beatles songs could sound so bad. Ringo has modestly said that Lennon/McCarteny songs were what made the Beatles great. But when you listen to those same songs sound so bad here, you know it was the way they were played by the Beatles that made the great. Don't be so modest, Ringo!"
1,"Forget This Ripoff, Buy The Original!","If anybody says this is better than the Beatles' songs, you know they're lying. More tolerable moments include Aeroesmith's rendition of ""Come Together"" and Billy Preston's ""Get Back"". You feel sorry for Peter Frampton being dragged into this mess, and hearing the disco kings the Bee Gees warble their way through is torture! Barry Gibb singing ""A Day In The Life"" is total blasphemy! For your sakes, stay away!!!"
5,14 Years Old AGAIN,"I no longer have this album however the moment I put the CD in the player I started singing and this movie came flooding back to me. I felt like a teenager again. I realize most people hated this movie and the songs but I enjoyed it and it made me happy. I don't know what the Beatles were on when they wrote these songs but I am so glad they did. Peter Framton, The Bee Gees, Steve Martin, Aerosmith, Earth Wind and Fire and of course the great George Burns - a movie like this will never be made again. This is a fun CD for a road trip and will have you smiling and singing for hours."
3,'Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' (Sony) Movie Soundtrack,"I remember the very day this movie opened in the theaters. Most people I knew thought it was a joke. I,personally thought both the movie and it's soundtrack was 'okay',not great but decent. Here,you get a 2-CD/24 track package of all the film's tunes. I thought ""Here Comes The Sun"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" performed by Sandy Farina was very well done. ""Sgt.Peppers..."", ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" and ""Getting Better"" sung by Peter Frampton And The Bee Gees were so-so,even felt that ""Come Together"" by Aerosmith was acceptable, but ""Because"" by Alice Cooper And The Bee Gees freaked me out the very first time I heard it on this soundtrack. In the film itself,it was a good scene. Semi-worth checking out."
2,"A bad album, but it did serve a purpose....","When the movie came out, I went to see it and got the soundtrack for one reason: AEROSMITH. I was in the 8th grade, and my music range was very narrow. At the time it consisted of Aerosmith, Nugent, and Styx. I put my 8track player on repeat, and listened to the 4th track over and over again. I loved Aerosmith doing ""Come Together"". One day my Uncle came over and asked me who the heck was that doing the Beatles' songs. I said ""Whose songs?"". He said ,""You've never heard of the Beatles?"" ""Should I?"" He then said, ""Come spend the weekend with me, your education is about to begin."" For the next 3 days, I listened to this group I had barely heard of before, and my world changed. It was like I was in a 10x10 room and somebody opened a window and I noticed for the first time there was a whole universe out there.So, yes, it is very bad, both the album and the movie. But without it, I might not have discovered the greatest music ever produced by anybody."
5,Great Christmas Present,My sister has been looking for this CD for some time and was so excited to get it for Christmas!
4,The Beatles Sang Those Songs?,"Needless to say, when this album came out in 1978, I was not as familliar with the music of the Beatles as I should have been. You mean Aerosmith didn't originally sing ""Come Together""? They couldn't have picked a better foursome to sing these classic songs (and act in this classic movie). The Bee-Gee's were IT back then and Peter Frampton can belt it out with the best of 'em. I cannot believe you actually have this CD as I have been searching for it EVERYWHERE for years. It's definitely one to put in and let play to the end, while singing along to every single song. It's great to see so many different artists in one movie and in one place on such a spectacular soundtrack! It's getting better all the time."
2,Poor Quality,Disc one would not play all the songs without skipping. No visible scratches on disc but recording quality was not acceptable.
5,WOW!,"well, dad made a fuss over sgt pepper all my life. So I bought it! I've heard a few beatles songs before, but they sound nothing like this! Their voices really changed in the 70's, but much better. The funniest thing about the album is the fake names they use, i.e. Bee Gees, George Burns (John impersonation an old man's voice), Peter Frampton, and hey, Aerosmith got their name from it. Wow! this has a hint of disco too! It's amazing that they got their voices so high when they were under the name, The Bee-Gees. Best album of all time, and I sure love the trumpet on the cover!"
4,Sgt. Pepper,Nice selections of songs and fast service getting the CD to me.The CD was for my son and he likes it.
1,Sgt. Pepper without The Beatles?,"I first saw this film as a junior high student way back in 1978. It's as bad as ""Kiss Meets The Phantom"". Anyone who thought it was a good idea to make a movie featuring Beatles songs sung by The Bee gees needs electro-shock Therapy! And ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" sung by Steve Martin!!??!! This movie is a disaster from start to finish. If you are a Beatles fan avoid this travesty at all costs."
4,"Love it, could not wait to get it",After searching for this CD for almost 2 decades it is finally here. Great compliment to the Beatles compilation of recordings.
5,groovy!,"I love this cd. I love the movie. It's my favorite. I sometimes think I'm Strawberry Fields. (strange, huh) this is all weird for a 13 year old!"
1,Total crapola,"Mere words cannot explain how horrible this album is. It is probably the single worst cover album ever made. Certainly, it's the worst ever work by one of the most overrated bands in history. Just the thought of this makes me want to puke."
2,9-5 OverKill,"My initial thoughts were ""this is a good book."" After reading more of it, I think I wasted my money."
1,I didn't like her,"If you love Sarah Vaughan, it's ok. If you like Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, June Christy and Doris Day, avoid her. Like me."
1,Inane Customer Support,"For the money there are many better printers than this one. Epsons are by far superior, but never mind quality. Let's talk about support. If you're a Mac user or ever intend to even consider it, don't bother with Lexmark. After buying a new iMac, I've been back and forth with Lexmark support in an endless exchange of my inquiries and their form letters. They would never admit that the printer wasn't going to work with my new iMac. They just sent me on fruitless quest after quest: Downloading drivers from different browsers, stopping installation mid stream, crazy stuff. All for nothing. What a bunch of fools. Never again Lexmark. Fool me twice, shame on me."
4,X73 a winner,"I operate a Windows ME Pentium III platform. The download from the provided disks in the package went smoothly. Very user-friendly. Just put it through its paces -- printing (from Word 2000), scan, and copying. Flawless performance, with a very smooth, nifty interface, Connection through USB port makes for quick, easy operation. I do not use the machine for fax purposes, since I am connected to broadband cable modem. The only downer -- when I got home and opened the box, I discovered that the required USB cable was not included, so I had to truck out to get one. Kind of chintzy of Lexmark. They should have included one in the package, and charged more if they had to. Yes, I realize that there was a reminder on the box (smallish print) not to forget the USB cable, but, hey, I still think they should have put one in the box. Nice, convenient product. Also, it is not a space hog -- fits nicely where my HP Deskjet used to go. At [price], highly recommended."
1,nothing but trouble,"This printer would not work consistantly from the disc, from the computor, from the LEXMARK downloads, or professional computor techs. I wasted time and money (on a complete computor diagnostic) trying to get the LEXMARK73 to work. At the beginning it would work for a few days, then slip into about three error situations. I am was being blamed for improper installing and only found out from the supplier that all of the LEX 73's were being returned on a recall. I think Lexmark should have notified me about the recall through the numerous calls to LEXMARK that I made regarding the install problems. I and my friends are not too impressed."
3,"High quality of a print, truthful colours, but.....",...the drivers not digitally singned by Microsoft for Windows XP logo.After four months the problems have appeared. Lexmark began to work not correctly. Reinstalling the drivers have not resulted. The updating of drivers has not helped.
1,not worth the trouble,"The lexmark x73 is my first printer. I bought it a couple of days ago at a computer show. I wished I never done it now I can't take it back and lost my money on it. I installed the software in my computer for it ( I have win xp) and it kept saying cannot comunicate with the printer. I went to there tech support online they told me to download the driver for it from them, so I did that and it is still saying cannot commuicate withe the printer. I bought another usb port cable and still the same thing. I would recommend not getting this thing. It is too much hassle and too much aggrevation for the money. Get a hewlert parkard or canon anything besides this."
1,More junk from a junk manufacturer,"-Terrible install software, regardless of Windows version (in other words, typical Lexmark)-Plastic main roller gear splits and causes feed failureIt's the perfect printer for those who like struggling with software errors and covering their hands in ink and epoxy!"
1,A Waste of Money,"I gave this to my husband as a gift on Christmas 2001. He never had any trouble setting it up to run on Windows ME. However, after buying some high-priced printer cartridges (including a color cartridge for $49.99 plus tax), the printer stopped working. A few months later, the scanner has quit, too. It was already out of warranty at the time of the printing problem, and no repair centers can be found anywhere close to us. Additionally, it would cost more than the item itself to take and get repaired. I have a beautiful Panasonic KX-P4410 that I rely on, and have for NINE YEARS. Never again, Lexmark, never again."
1,services for this product don't exist,"After trying to take this unit in for repair it's obvious the company doesn't care about happy customers, I won't be making any lexmark puchaces in the future, and I will tell everyone I know for years to come about the crime of truth in advertising that this company won't stand up for thier own products. I just wish I could find a representative to give them both a float test."
1,"Horrible product, don't waste your money","this printer doesn't run at all with xp, and just causes problem after problem. the tech support is worthless and you have to go searching to even find a phone number to call. stay away from this machine even though it seems like a good deal."
4,"Love, Sex, Art: It's All in the Mind",This book gives you an idea of how incestuous the Surrealist movement was. It gives an insight into what went on in the artistic circles of the era. It is thoughtful and extraordinarily interesting. The various authors and their different viewpoints help to show the complexity of the movement and the artists without being too much in awe of artists like Man Ray or Hans Bellmer. It is also a beautiful book with a pretty pink and gold embossed cover (under the dust jacket). Full of stunning reproductions and personal photographs. Excellent read and aesthically pleasing.
5,Changed my music tremendously!,"When I found this book and looked inside, I was blown away! Finally a book that shows you just what you need to know without drowning you in theory and WITHOUT being geared towards guitarists! I make electronic dance music and found this book (along with a chord wheel) to be an amazing resource to improve your songwriting techniques. I went from 2-chord songs with no discernible structure to amazingly complex songs with dramatic chord changes!Since I use a computer sequencer along with my keyboard, programming these chords into my sequencer then playing them back while improvising melodies on top of them has been absolutely amazing. I really think if you're making electronic dance music you can benefit a lot from this book, but to a larger extent any songwriter could find something here that makes it worth the purchase price!"
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!,I love this book i cant say enough about it. If you love to write songs this book is great. its very interesting!!!!!!!
2,Melody isn't provided along with the chord progression,"Most tracks on the Audio CD have a melody along with the chord progression. However, a newbie with insufficient ear training won't be able to play the melody at ease. If the author can provide those songs as Midi file formats, that would resolve the issue. Because many software such as Apple's Logic Express can convert the midi files into printed musical notes on paper.Other than that I like this book."
4,Contour pillow,"Nice comfortable contour pillow, but uses up batteries fast! Very soft, pliable, messages well, releaves neck pain.Overall a good product and worth the asking price."
1,long-time fan very dissapointed,"I've relied on Let's Go for years, but after 2 months in Mexico I'm ready to trash my 2004 Let's Go Mexico. I expect prices and other info to change occasionally, but I don't expect the latest edition of a guide book to be blatantly wrong more than half the time. I have serious doubts that anyone from Let's Go has actually stepped foot in Mexico in years.On multiple ocassions the book has costed me huge amounts of time by directing me to restaurants that didn't exist, or by falsely saying that a museum would be open on Monday. I also second the last reviewer's comment that the current edition doesn't have any of the unique tips that made Let's Go such a treasure in Europe and South America.Definitely DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. My friends have Lonely Planet and seem a lot more satisfied."
3,It's not the belts fault,"The belt advertised as a POLY COG belt in not. It's just the plain ribbed belt. The belt is fine, the ad was not."
5,Straight from the Heart!,"Bazhe pulls no punches, his poetry hits straight to the heart, sometimes with gossamer delicacy, other times with breathtaking brutality. Here is a writer who has been through the wringer of life and emerged artistically richer through his experiences."
2,Description misleading,"I just want to emphasize to someone interested in purchasing this book...there is NO verbal technique given on how to render any drawings. There is a drawing only...with a description of paper, medium, etc...but no ""how to"" on reproducing it. I am a professional artist and I was hoping to learn from this book how someone else might create a drawing with certian papers, paints, etc....but, there is no information of the steps taken...just the end result."
2,Awful,"I bought this book and disliked it so much that it was the one and only book I have ever returned to Amazon. It was terribly dated which would have been acceptable if the content was there but it wasn't. Save some money AND get what you're looking for in Color Drawing: Design Drawing Skills and Techniques for Architects, Landscape Architects, and Interior Designers by Michael E. Doyle. That's what I replaced it with and I love it!"
4,"Beware: they ARE Orange, not Yellow as in the picture","I just received these small, removable color-coding labels. Though the description said, ""neon orange,"" I went by the picture, since I know that sometimes an orangish yellow might be referred to as ""orange."" Unfortunately, the labels are orange, and really look nothing like the color in the picture shown.Other than that, these are great labels for color-coding, pricing for yard sales, sticking on your nose to make your child laugh, and other purposes.One star taken off for incorrect picture."
4,Electric trance..but only for CD 1.,"Only CD 1 was worth the title, Electric. The second CD was more chilled and I couldn't really dance to it. The first CD was the only thing that saved this album in general. Godskitchen needs to step up their game if they want my cash!!!!"
4,"WW2, Navy",This DVD is an average movie but its one of the few shot in color. I thought the movie had an excellent ending.
4,Flat top,"I saw this movie in 1954 when it was released and have always wanted to see it again, Well, I did! There is no attempt at authenticity as far as one scene the hero is taking off in an F4U and his wingman is in a F6F, or the squadron is flying F4U's but the takeoff scences are Helldiver's. It is typical propaganda for how wholesome and fine are the American kids but there is some value in how whole heartedly we all endorsed that ideal of American goodness. It is wonderful to recall a time when we believed that America would not endorse a war that was possibly wrong."
1,Sterling Hayden's Amazing Transformers Squadron,"I am so glad I rented this Marianas Turkey instead of buying it.Sterling Hayden leads a squadron of amazing Navy fliers whose planes magically change from F4Us to F6Fs and back again in a single mission.Apparently, this was our secret weapon to defeat Japanese Transformer squadrons which could change from Zeros into giant Kawanishi flying boats.Sterling Hayden later led his amazing Transformers squadron to victory over Godzilla and then had a smoke with Raymond Burr.The editor of this turkey should be taken out and keelhauled.Famous quote: ""The smoking lamp is lit"" - Sterling Hayden"
1,Flat Top,"Save your money! This film was not worth the price.You would be better off getting ""Task Force"" with Gary Cooper"
3,Good War Flick,"I enjoyed this movie. I agree with a lot of what the other reviewers said. Some of it was pretty dated and the acting wasn't great but it was a good old school war movie. Also I noticed while watching that the planes seemed to change in the live action footage but it was ok cause the real life combat footage was so real and so intense that it could only add to the movie.This may not be for everybody but for old school movie fans and war movie fans from the good old days, I think you will like it."
4,Flat Top is Top Rate,Great movie.... A bit smaltzy but considering when it was made that was the movie strategy at the time. Good footage of real action. Well worth the purchase.
4,Bell X-1 Model,"Good model for my son's science school project. Good instructions. Smaller in size than we anticipated, but very detailed."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I ordered this book in hopes of getting a good detailed history of Savage Arms and the models they offered (production figures, dates of manufacture, etc.). This book is nothing more than a compilation of advertisements and excerpts from brochures and magazines with very little actual content, and offers next to nothing for information on models after the mid 50's. While the book does offer a plethera of info on the Model 99 and the Pocket Pistols, all other models get very little coverage."
1,Not very good,"This book has little, if any, original text. In my opinion, it is simply a compilation of old catalogs and old articles."
3,Change of Thought,"After reading the 3 existing reviews, I decided not to buy the book. Howver, after several weeks of searching for information on the Model 219 Savage single shot rifles to no avail, I ordered the book. Yes, it does have lots of reprints, and lacks detail on various models that other authors provide about other brand guns. However, there were two paragraphs devoted to my rifle and they just about doubled the information I had been able to get on my own. So, I am well satisfied with the book. It was worth the price for the additional informtion I received. Also, it may help me in the future with information about other Savage rifles."
2,Why Briggs & Stratton,"Why put a piece of junk engine on a great splitter. The splitter is great and the engine is great, IF you can start it. I'll never buy another product with a Briggs in it. Worthless if it doesn't start, Honda has been starting on the first pull in everything they power for years. Can't Briggs figure it out after all this time."
4,Awesome.,This is a great product. I wanted a basic utility belt and got one at a good price and one that was made out of very nice material. Thank you.
3,"Solid Pouch Belt for Costumes, Camping, Etc","I bought this for a costume. It looks authentic enough and did the trick. It's a bit heavy -- combine that with the plastic buckle (which doesn't look too durable) and I wouldn't recommend this for any serious functional purposes. The snaps are ok and stay closed well enough. However, they can be tricky to closed again when you're wearing it."
4,Gary A,"I've been listening to John Stewart since 1963 and this is a collection of some of his best, earliest songs. I like it, but I can hear these songs done better on my vinyl collection. The music is as great as ever, but the technical recording is not brilliant."
4,Decent Price,"Not going to rave. No complaints. These go to the best tooth brush ever. So, by association, they are guilty-- of being accomplises to the electric tooth brush that is very really truly the best one out there. Thanks OralB, Braun, and Amazon !"
1,THEY RIP PEOPLE OFF,"I GOT FOUR ORAL B REPLACEMENT BRUSH HEADS AND THEY WERE ALL FAKE....THEY BROKE IN 2 WEEKS ,I CONTACTED THE SELLER AND THEY SEND ME NEW ONCE.THE PACKAGE LOOKS COMPLETLY DIFFRENT THAN THE ONE THAT THEY SENT BEFORE...I HAD TO DELET THE FEEDBACK BECAUSE THEY FORCED ME TO DO IT.DO NOT BUY FORM THIS SELLER"
2,There is a reason they are less expensive,"These brushes are definitely not the same replacement heads I buy at my local stores. I have uesd the Oral-B precision tooth brush for years and love it. First use of these new heads, I knew the quality was not the same. I would not recomment these, I would have rather spent the extra money to make the tooth brush as effective as it has been over the past few years. I can only hope I do not experience the breakage other customers have complained about. Bristles are soft, and brush is a little erratic. The packaging is not in English, and these are claerly substandard."
1,defective,"I purchased this 4 pack which even came with a free extra one, but when it came time to replace the head it came off in two pieces, requiring a pliers to remove the part stuck to the base, of course it was after the 30 days alloted to return , so I will use the heads but will not buy anymore from this merchant"
1,Dangerous item,"Hard to believe a toothbrush head can be dangerous, but these are. I didn't know these were not built by Braun. If they are, someone really dropped the ball at the QC station. The brush heads become loose very quickly. Aside from pinching parts of your mouth in the loosened gap, they will eventually disintegrate in your mouth. I have just ordered the Braun labeled heads and hopefully, they are up to the excellent quality of the originals. These replacements however should be avoided until the quality concerns are addressed. That's my opinion anyway."
1,ALSO brush head become loose after short period of time,"I don't want to rate even one star..... I bought a package of four brushes, and have used two. The brush heads fell apart after a very short period of time. If only the first fell apart, we can say it is an ""accident"". But what can we say if the second also fell apart even just after half a month?! I have to write this review here... And I will never buy this product from here again."
2,Knockoffs!!!,"These replacement brush heads do have an Oral-B logo on them, but the quality seems to be more in line with some no-name knockoffs that I have used. Long before the blue wear indicator bristles show that the brush needs replacement, I have had the top oscillating brush part fall off. 3 out of 4 heads fell apart within 2 weeks. I wonder why Amazon sells this kind of crap under the guise of a name brand?"
1,"Suspect It's a KnockOff, Is Dangerous","Like many others have found, these ""replacement"" brushes are dangerous. The brush assembly comes loose after a short, pinches your cheeks. On one unit the the metal piece that holds the brush to the stem protruded, didn' realize that until I saw blood. AMAZON; you should stop selling these brushes until the SELLER proves that these units are actually made by ORAL-B. I'm suspect because on another ocassion I bought a ""SANDISK"" memory stick (on eBay) that didn't seem to work right. I called SANDISK, and after giving them the serial number per their request, I learned that the item was not made by SANDISK! Yet, everything about the item appeard normal, including the packaging (which I compared with a store-bought unit). These brush units may likewise be knockoffs, and the SELLER might not even realize this. I call upon the SELLER and AMAZON to investigate. Don't sell these anywmore, these brushes are dangerous."
2,Not like the originals!!!,It's hard to pass up this product because of the great price so I tried them anyway. Well I've learned my lesson that if over 30% of customers are giving 1 or 2 stars to a product then it is best to stay away!!This replacement brush makes a lot of noise and the brush head doesn't spin as strong as the original one I had. Also I seem to get a lot more saliva/water from my mouth dripping down the side of brush onto the toothbrush handle and onto my hand.I have gone back read other reviews on the product and I'm not waiting to see what other disasters will happen with these brushes. I hardly ever return items but for this product it's just best to return it as these brushes definitely do not work anything like the originals!! I've noticed that almost all the negative reviews for this product have come within the past 12 months.(NB: I got mine through Mr. Bargain).
2,Is it the Real Thing?,"I was sure these were the same replacement heads that came with my original Braun toothbrush, but evidently not. The brush mechanism is SO loose that I am not really sure if my teeth are getting the same good brushing. The loose space between the brush and stem actually pinches the inside of my mouth as I brush. I certainly would never repeat the purchase. I will look for genuine replacements."
4,Oral B Brush Heads,"There was a lot written on the Internet about inferior ""knock-off"" brush heads, sold as Oral-B products, that fell apart after just a few uses.The ones I received appear genuine and have held up so far.The product was shipped in a timely fashion"
1,Works great when they work.,I bought two eight packs an 6 out of the pack broke within one month use. The old ones worked great. Not sure what happened but if you scan the internet you will find this is a major issue with these.
3,Replacement Brush Heads for Power Toothbrush.,This item is very good but basic for a power toothbrush. There are other heads that offer a more excelent cleaning because of added cleaning devices such as rubber cleaning pics that move alone with the brush itself.
1,My Amazon experience ordering Oral B Replacement Brush Heads,I ordered this in December 2009 and it still has not been delivered in spite of my communications with Amazon and the dealer.!!!
1,rip-off,"The Oral-B is a good product but the refills certainly aren't worth what they charge for them. I don't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip-off price. They could make a great profit selling these refills at something like $2.50 each, their rip off price of $8.50 ea is beyond absurd. The other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months. That's a real laugh. Even brushing just once a day, you're lucky if you get a month out of them. So not only do they rip you off with their refill cost, they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with."
2,died after 5 months,It died after 5 months and I had bought replacement brushes so now I have to get another one. 5 months? Not good.
1,Imitation? Beware!,"Thought I'd add my vote to the many reviewers before me: this product did NOT perform as well as the original heads that came with the brush. While these do seem to brush my teeth well enough, every one of them (am now on # three out of a 4 pack) have regularly pinched my lips and tongue while in use. And the last brush wobbled and fell apart while in use. Will not purchase again."
2,Not a great purchace,"These are supposed to be the correct replacement heads for my toothbrush. They have the same name and look EXACTLY like they should. But when I attached one of them, I noticed that the fit was not right- it was on there, but it was way too loose. And that was after a good 5 min of hurting my fingers, trying to squeeze the color ring onto the bottom of the head... I got it on there but not without difficulty. I am still using the head on my toothbrush... only because I can't afford another one right now. It came halfway off the base while brushing yesterday... and the piece with bristles is starting to detach from the stem. Don't think it'll last much longer. This product is an imposter!"
2,BEWARE of imitations/swaps...Euro package is sub-standard,"I ordered ""Oral-B Precision Clean"" and that was also listed on the package invoice.I received the Euro-packaged Flexisoft, which are useless! I've used Flexisoft for years and I know a good/new from a bad brush; these were soft/er out of the package than should be after 3+ months' use.Kabat Enterprises, LLC / US Health Tests promptly refunded my money when I complained, and that is why I have removed my negative feedback for the seller.Posting this feedback to warn others of the product swap and performance.BUYER BEWARE!"
4,does the job,"The Brush Heads are great, i can't complain. They are not too soft, not too hard - just right. They are excellent replacement brushheads for your OralB electronic toothbrush"
5,Oral-B Electric tooth brushes heads,"The right product and great price.Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase on line and deprive the CORRUPT politicians from collecting sales tax.This is the right product, at very good price and the corrupt politicians did not collect any sales tax.My only regret is that I did not purchace more at the same time.I will purchase again."
3,Not so good.,"Not necessarily a reflection of the seller, but every single toothbrush head has broken. I have never had a problem with other store bought Oral-B products, but these have been awful. I have contacted Oral-B and they were more than happy to replace the broken toothbrush heads (which have been perfect so far)."
1,Wears out fast!,"Within a couple of weeks these brush heads get more loose than the original head did in a year. After a few more weeks, the heads flop around so much its hard to see how they stay together. The packaging and such looks authentic but I can't believe it. They pinch your cheeks when they wobble even when you are very careful. I'm going to find a store where they cost more because in this case the deal is not a deal."
1,Faulty product,I've ordered replacement heads from various stores for years and never had a problem. But these heads are faulty. You are lucky if you get a weeks use out of each head. I've had metal pins come out in my mouth and broken bits of plastic while brushing. Not too mention the horrible pinches it does on your lip because it is so loose and wobbly.I don't know if this is a problem with Oral B quality control or just this vendor but I've never had this issue before and now I'm seeing it from many many people besides myself.
1,Waste of $10,None of the heads I received fit properly...they would constantly become loose and come off while I was brushing. The actual brushing action felt weak as well. Waste of money.
2,Defective Oral B brushes,I have so far used 2 of the 4 brushes. A small part broke off of both of them and I found myself with a small piece of metal that looked similar to a tack in my mouth. I don't know if this is the normal quality of this product or just a defective batch.
2,Too good to be true,"I purchased several packets of this item. The first one I used turned out to be defective. I have 11 others to go through right now. So, I gave it two stars and will hold off on a final opinion until I see how the others hold up."
4,Good,These replacement heads are as good as the one that came with the toothbrush. I would highly recommend this product.
3,Works well.,"These replacement heads work well, but they still rattle just a little bit on my Oral-B electric toothbrush. But, getting the 4-count (as opposed to a 3-pack package) makes it worth it."
2,Brush head doesn't fit all Oral B Braun electric toothbrushes,"I was disappointed to find that these replacement heads do not fit my oral B braun electric toothbrush, even though it says right in the description, 'The four replacement brush heads in this pack fit all Braun Oral-B electric toothbrushes.' Now I am not sure what replacement heads to buy because I cannot trust Amazon's description of what tooth brushes they fit."
4,Good Replacement for Manufacturers Original,These replacement toothbrush heads worked perfectly with my unit. As far as I can tell there is little difference between these and the original Oral-B branded heads that I previously used. I recommend them.
1,Beware of old product . . .,"Ordering the 4-head deal is great, however, when mine arrived,the packaging was quite old and worn-out looking. My thoughtswere confirmed when I broke all four heads within about 3 monthsof using them. The small rotating piece on the back of the headbroke off while brushing. I somehow found the first three but, unfortunately swallowed the forth today. The small piece makes thebrush head rotate in a uniform patten. When it breaks you can stilluse the toothbrush but, with lesses results; what's the point in that?If your order packaging looks old and worn, the plastic is old also causing premature aging of the plastic heads making them brittle. Pleasebe aware of this issue. BTW, I don't brush hard either! Hope this helps."
1,They're real but the same poor quality you get in cheap knockoffs,"Some of the brush heads are loose right out of the pack, the others becomes loose after very little use (10-20 minutes of cumulative brushing time). When the brush heads are loose, they don't rotate back and forth the way they are supposed to when you hold the brush head against your teeth; they can pinch your lip or cheek, and they can come apart in your mouth. And they can even come apart in your mouth. I've used a Braun/Oral-B since before Proctor and Gamble took over and the quality was never this poor. A bad brush head now and then but not whole packages. I've seen knockoffs that are of this poor quality. I've checked with Procter & Gamble (Oral-B has been owned by P&G since 2006) to determine whether these are counterfeit and am convinced that they are genuine Oral-B product, just terribly poor quality Oral-B product. Perhaps when P&G took over Oral-B, they found ways to cut costs and quality has suffered as a result."
5,good as always,"i think its always better to buy the same as brush company, atleast you know it will protect your gum"
4,The picture does not match what arrived,"The brush that arrived at my house looks a bit different since it's the new Oral-B replacement brush head, but it seems fine.[...]"
5,Excellent buy!,I started buying these brushheads 3 years ago. They are an excellent value. Super safe and gentle on my very sensitive teeth they have worked for me on at least two different models of Oral B high end electric brushes. Get it - it's a great deal!
5,Oral B,Yipee. Thanks to amzn/UPS the replacement heads arrived just in time; especially since I had trouble finding this product locally.
1,Lack of description - doesn't work for ProfessionalCare,"Be careful, even though theses brush heads look exactly like all the others for Oral-B brushes, they doesn't work with the ""ProfessionalCare"" brushes.Unfortunately, the product description doesn't tell you that, therefore I give 1 star only.The customer cannot see for what type of brush it works - lack of essential description, bad rating!It's of course not a rating of the brush itself since I couldnt try it but I want people to be aware that the brush heads might not fit on their brush.According to the packaging they work for example with the ""Vitality"" brush. If that's your brush you can probably go for it.I ordered before brush heads for my ProfessionalCare that fit. Go for the ones called ""Oral B EB17-3"" they fit and work perfectly."
1,should have looked at previous reviews,the replacement toothbrush wobbles and sometimes pinches my lip. I will not be buying anymore from Amazon partners. This may just be a counterfit. I also complained to Customer Service since the padded envelope it came in also contained a neatly folded religous newsletter.
1,Fake!,Bought these from Mr Bargain some time ago. They break faster than normal and I suspect they are bad fakes. You can try on your own if you want
3,quick response,"I could not find these anywhere in the stores where I got them before. Waspleased to find them. I could not believe how fast they came.One had a lose head that could not be fixed,so now I have 3 toothbrushes, rather than one. These things happen. I am just happy to receive them and the price is reasonable."
5,Clean teeth,"I am a soldier stationed over seas and I always have to buy this product from our military store called ""AAFES"" but what surprised me the most about this product was the price I paid for this online. I saved myself $10 even after I paid for the shipping. Shame on you AAFES, but all in all my teeth don't feel as clean if I just use a normal tooth brush. Once you use a Oral B tooth brush you wont go back to normal tooth brushes again."
4,Braun Oral B Toothbrush Heads,"These brush heads were easy to install and they were a great value from the merchant compared to store prices. It appears as though the brush head does not fit snugly, but I have had no problems."
2,Can't be original product,"I've been using my Oral-B electric toothbrush for a while now, and I love it. Seriously. Best money I've spent in a long time - no one likes pain in a dentist's chair, and my exams are always great now.[...]. Unfortunately, though the head LOOKS like an Oral-B head and is branded identically, it is not the same product.Luckily I have not had the destructive, painful experiences of some of the one-star raters, but was clear from the first use that it's not the same product. The plastic bristles aren't very flexible so they don't really get around a tooth; the texture is different, too -- like it should be squeaking in protest. They simply don't do the job the ""real"" product does.I bought two packs - I will probably return the second, as I'm not sure they will accept the first one that I opened."
5,Amazon verified product(Oral B Precision Clean Brush Heads),"I have used Oral-B toothbrush heads for years and swear by them. My purchase before this one was the generic brand. I thought they were great a first. But after 2 weeks of use they started performing badly. I went through all 4 in 8 weeks. Now, these non-generic brushes are great. They have a slightly bigger head than ones in the past, but I find them to be more comforting and fitting(hard to explain). They last a long time also. The cost through Amazon is still less costly than through your local stores."
1,Misleading images,"This is the same product I shunned in retail stores due to unwanted changes Braun has made. The product in Image 1, the original design, is not the same as Image 2, the changed design, which I received. Although the price was great and shipping fast, I'm disappointed in the disparity of how the product is represented. I hesitate to say the item was misrepresented but am at a loss to call it anything else."
1,AWFUL.....Don't Buy,I bought two packages of these and none were any good. The bursh heads in the first package didn't fit correctly and were constantly falling off or catching my lip and pinching it. All the heads in the second pack broke off within a week of putting them on. Waste of money. Buy the real Braun heads and forget out these generic ones.
5,Great item,"I bought this item for my 11 year old who wore braces, but now wears retainers. She loves it and it works great for her."
4,really good,Best I have ever felt my teeth after cleaning. Does a great job will buy again when needed.
2,Lower quality,"These replacements are formerly known as flexiSoft, which have white center bristles instead of the original green bristles. I believe this so called improved design (Precision Clean Brush Head) is much more inferior, in terms of the quality of the bristles, than its predecessor. The condition of the bristles, after merely two weeks of normal tooth brushing, appear worst than the bristles on the previous model with 3 to 4 months worth of usage. Obviously Oral-B is trying to cut corners here by offering a newer model with inferior quality.If you got the ones with green bristles like those pictured above, you should be fine. Unfortunately my latest order came with the white center bristles, the kind that you should be avoiding. Anyway, I'm pulling out this particular item from my Amazon Subscribe & Save program."
1,THESE DO NOT FIT ALL ORAL B! BEWARE!,"The description says these heads fit ALL ORAL B..they do not, the package clearly states DOES NOT FIT: Vitality Sonic, Sonic Complete OR Cross Action Power. They do say they fit: Triumph, Professional Care, Vitality and AdvancePower.I'm sending them back hopefully!!!Buyer BEWARE!"
1,Each brush has been defective,"I have owned my Oral-B toothbrush for years. I normally buy the replacement brushes from my local Osco or Walgreens -- 3 brushes for $23. Each brush replacement lasts at least 6 months, & I don't replace the brush until the color is faded. I decided to try the Amazon brush replacements to save money -- $4 brushes for $12. A good deal - right? Wrong! I purchased the brushes on 12/1/09. I am already on my 3rd brush! The first two each had the same problem -- something in the head loosened causing the head to wobble when in use on the brush. As it wobbled, it pinched my tongue & gums -- my tongue actually had bleeding cuts from it! Both of the first two heads are defective, & of poor quality. This never happened with the expensive heads -- I never had a problem, I used them until the color faded, & then threw them away. I am totally disappointed in these Amazon heads. I will try all 4 heads to see if this is just a fluke, or if these are all of inferior quality."
1,"Knock-off product, poor quality","These Oral-B Vitality/Precision Clean heads are not the same quality as the original head that came with my Oral-B Vitality toothbrush. The original head lasted for several months, but these do not last as long.I've used 2 of the 4 so far. The first was considerably noisier than the original head, but not wanting to waste it, I continued to use it anyway. After about a week of regular use, the part of the head that rotates became looser and looser. It was falling apart. I threw that one away, and moved onto a second. This one is also very noisy. I'm afraid that this one is falling apart, too.I will buy more replacement heads from a different seller. I do not recommend this seller's product."
1,Can't be authentic Oral-B brush-heads,"I totally agree with the other reviewer - I seriously doubt these are legitimate Oral-B replacement heads. After one week of use the head becomes lose, pinches lips, tongue and gums, very noisy, excessive vibration. Defective or knock-offs?"
1,This item doesn't fit Oral B S-200,"Web site suggested that this set of brushes often bought with theOral B S-200 brush. It does not fit, thus the site caused me to buysomething that is unuseable."
1,Probably Fake Brush heads,Don't buy this pack. Most likely these are fake brush heads and all four of the brush heads in my pack fell apart.
1,Defective,We have been using the Oral-B brushes for years - through at least three base units. This is the first time we have experienced problems with the brush heads. Two of the four quickly failed as described by others (the heads became so loose they no longer worked) and a third one sometimes pinches the cheek. I have noticed that some of the descriptions on the packages are in German first with English underneath.
5,REPLACEMENT ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH HEADS,Arrived when expected in excellent condition.Same great quality. I will buy them again when I run out in a year or so.
5,Oral B Replacement Brushes,"I have used the Oral B electric toothbrush for quite some time and my dentist likes it. I do too, as I can access all tooth surfaces with ease. I ordered these brushes as replacement for used brushes and they work fine. Don't leave home without using this.."
1,Poor Replacements,These brush replacements look like they were produced for the European market. After a week or two of use they become very loose and pinch your gums. They should be recalled as defective and all purchasers should have their money refunded.
2,Definetly counterfit,We really shouldn't be suprised by the poor quality of these brush heads. The have too be counterfit as the language on packaging indicates this.
5,"great product, great transactions","I love this product,perfect for kids. transaction was fast and most of all good deal. I will buy again."
3,"Might be bad luck, but the head broke at the second use","Either the product was defective, or mail packaging wasn't adequate, but the spring in the brush broke at the second use. I expected this things to last more than that."
3,As expected,Use this product regularly. Amazon 2 day Prime arrived a day early. Product as expected. Too expensive as oral b brand. Have discovered generics don't work for long so forced to use brand name.
1,Count the bristle groups on brushhead,"Target now also sells their own brand of ""Oral B"" replacement brushes under the label ""Up and Up"". They are the same as the ones sold here at discounted prices. They are of very low quality. I tried Targets. They do not fit properly, the connector part is slightly bigger. They do come loose and fall off in my mouth, there is not the same vibrating motion, they are a little rough. Also, I closely compared an off brand one to an Oral-B and found that there are less bristles on the cheaper one. The bristles are in little groups: Oral B=26, offbrand=18. So, you get what you pay for, I am afraid. Still, Oral B could be kinder and charge less for these simple little things, we know it costs very little to make them. Note: there should be ""Oral B"" inscribed on the arm of the replacement brush heads. If it is not there, it is definitely not theirs."
1,Fake product,"Purchased from Amazon.com directly, not some third parties which sold via Amazon.com.Fake products, stop working properly about 1 week of use. Significant difference is observed compare to the original brush head come with the toothbrush purchase."
4,Ok Batch but a bit Inferior to the Original,"Does what it's supposed to do but doesn't feel as nifty as the original I bought before, even though they are labeled as originals."
5,ORAL B PRECISION CLEAN BRUSH HEAD,"ORAL B PRECISION BRUSH HEADS ARE GREAT TO USE WITH YOUR ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH.IT FITS THE ORAL BRUSH,VERY WELL AS YOU USE IT FOR DAILY BRUSHING.IT COME IN A PACK OF 4 AND IT LAST FOR MANY BRUSHING.THE PRICE IS A LITTLE HIGH,BUT IT DOES DO,WHAT IT IS DESIGNED FOR."
3,Replacement Brush Heads,"These brush heads made in Germany work pretty well, except somehow they don't seem to last quite as long as Oral-B brush heads I've bought at CVS."
4,"Good, but better combined with Sonicare.","These are good and the spinning works to make you feel clean in the mouth, but your teeth won't be any whiter. If you are looking for a whiter smile, I would suggest the Sonicare and combine it with using this Oral-B Precision. The 2 together are perfect."
1,Brush head become loose after short period of time,"I purchased this Oral-B Precision Clean 4 pack replacement head, I highly doubt if this is original Oral-B product. After few weeks of light use, the brush head became loose and wobbling causing extra noise, it pinched my lips and tongue. I am on the 3rd brush head now (out of the 4 pack I bought), they all broke the same way.I remembered I bought the 2 or 3 pack replacement brush head from Target before, they worked exactly like the original, but expensive. That's why it was so tempting to get this cheap ""thought to be original"" alternative. Be aware!"
1,Faulty product,"The first brush head started making excess noise and suddenly lost its little metal pin within four uses. I chalked it up to one bad product and put the second one on. Within days that one did the same thing and was pinching the inside of my mouth. So I tried the third brush head. This one actually came apart into two pieces right in my mouth after two or three uses. When the fourth brush head started sounding like the first two had before their pins fell out, I decided this was more than a simple fluke and asked for instructions to return them. The seller has said I will receive a refund but I just sent them back a few days ago. I now assume these were factory rejects and I was not made aware of that before my purchase. I will not buy these online again. I have never had a problem with many of the same product purchased in the store."
1,Fell apart at 2 months of use,The head on the replacement brush became loose and wobbly after exactly 2 months of use on the first head that I've just replaced again. These appear to be made with lesser quality than other replacements I've used.
1,Fell apart after < 1 month use. Do not buy this!,"I have used Oral-B Precision Clean brushes for many years and never had a problem - until I got a pack from Amazon this sprint. Either this is a complete fake, or there was a huge fault at the factory - causing all of these 1-star reviews. I experiences the same problems as all others did: all brush heads became loose, metal rods fell off, pinched my and my wife's lips several times, until the whole brush head would fall apart. DO NOT BUY THIS! Amazon needs to do something about this product and manufacturer!!!"
2,poor quality,"These replacement heads don't hold up nearly as well as the one's I've bought at retail at W-mart. They begin to wobble and get loose after a short time of use. I doubt that they are true Oral B replacement heads. I've never had any problems with the store bought heads, other than the high price. I won't buy more."
1,Bad suppliers?,"This item seem to be fake, as it breaks down very easily and I had to spit out a piece of steel that came off the brush mechanism. I had to throw the brush heads out and buy new ones on eBay from sellers with 100% feedback. Suggestion to Amazon: find better suppliers that sell genuine brush heads."
1,Shouldn't These Last Longer Than Two Weeks?,"Every one of these Oral B refill heads has broken in two weeks or less, making this a very expensive ""bargain"". These are not of the quality of the Oral B refills you can buy in a store. Zero stars!"
1,Knock Off!! DO NOT BUY!,These are knock offs! They wobble and do not fit right. The other reviewers are correct. DO NOT BUY!
5,good read,"This was a good read, I liked the style Pate wrote in. I could understand what Ben was going through. I think Helen should have been more supported of his writing, instead of putting him down. It was different how Makeba's throughts were brought out in a journal form."
4,Good product but not cheap,Great product except the price. My package arrived missing the straps that tie it down to the fram. Made do with zip ties. Great product... just expensive.
4,Is a very understandable monogram about Complex Integration,I have already read the most part of this monogram about Complex Integration and the Cauchy's Theorem and I have found it very clearwhen comes to explaining the Cauchy's Theorem.In Chapter VI There aresome evaluation of integrals and walk you thru step by step up to thethe solution of the integrals.At the end of chapter VI there are about50 exercises to evaluate integrals that I found them very challenging.I recomend this monogram to somebody that is interested in learningComplex Integration or brush up to some background that you might havein Complex Analysis.
3,kinda long winded,"Bought this book for my husband for a school, he isnt much of a reader so i took a look at the book myself, the words were ridiculously long. Though I am always pleased with amazon, and we recieved the book within 2 days! thanks amazon!!!"
5,A real page turner,This is an excellent book that reads more like a novel than the true story that it is . You can not put it down . It really gives you an appreciation for the painstaking investigation needed to crack these kinds of cases . It also gives the reader an appreciation for the amount of damage that can be done by a single traitor . It is a great tribute to the men and women who make huge personal sacrifices in anonymity to preserve our freedom .
4,The Spy Catcher,"Interesting book on espionage and the role of the US Army in combating it. The author shares a career of experiences and expertise with the reader, often making you feel as if you were there with him. Writing style makes the work an easy and fast read. RECOMMENDED."
5,Superb Cold War History,"Stuart Herrington here documents from first-hand knowledge the extent of enemy acquisition of our most sensitive Cold War plans and documents, how traitorous Americans played the key role in that penetration, and how hundreds of hard-working and dedicated counterintelligence officers worked for decades to finally ferret out the betrayers and bring them to justice. Understated in tone and extremely well written, this will become an intelligence classic."
3,Necessary,"This is necessary for use with a modern laptop. You can probably find one cheaper at your local huge computer store, but this is the one sold guaranteed to be the right gender for you autostar cables."
1,"Terrible, Terrible",I tried it and the meat got stuck. I had to disassemble and clean multiple times to finish grounding two pounds' of meat. Ended up returning it.
1,It's NOT stainless-stell,"I think the machine was great at first. It's fast and eficient, but if you have more than 5 lb.of meat to grind and you don't want smoke coming out from the motor, You might want to give it a break in between. Plus, the cutting plates and the feed screw turn rusting and black even you put cooking oil after wash as directed by the instruction book, and they have this iron/metal smell on the cutting plate that contaminate the meat. I am very disappointed."
1,"""Made in China""","I bought this machine as a gift for my wife, without knowing that it is ""Made in China."" The first time we tried to use it, the power light came on but the engine refused to move. I will keep you updated about ""the return procedure."" However, I advice everyoane who wants to buy something to find out first where the object was manufactured. IF THE PRODUCT WAS MADE IN CHINA DON'T BUY IT!"
3,Works great...until you lose a part,"This product works great. I've used it many times to make chili and sausage. Made up to 40 pounds of sausage in a single day. However I eventually lost the blade and am unable to find a replacement. One tip...store the metal parts in dry rice to keep them from rusting. I've had this just over a year, and no signs."
4,A little young for my 9-year old,"My 9-year old found this too easy for her. She also said the boy ""wasn't like her"" because of his compulsiveness (she has obsessive thoughts mostly). However, in the next few days I caught her doing some of her semi-complusive routines and told her she was more like the boy than she thought. She agreed. I wish we could have found this book a few years ago. But it did open up a dialogue about some things, which was great for us. It's one of the few children's books out there on the subject so I wouldn't pass it up, even if it was a little juvenile for your child."
5,Must have - Must read for both Parents & children!,"Dr. Wagner's book UP and Down the Worry Hill is a must read for parents and children who are dealing with OCD. The simple message easily translates to children and most importantly makes them feel like they have control over their thoughts and emotions instead of OCD. I have recommended this book to our church, school and doctors office. I have had the opportunity to work directly with Dr. Wagner with my child and her ability to work with OCD children is incredible. Her program, along with materials associated with this book gave my son his smile back.We regularly use the book as a resource when issues come up from time to time. If your child is struggling with OCD I would highly recommend this book. I would recommend reading it with others in the family as well."
5,I highly recommend,"We just found out that my 11-year-old son has OCD. We had not told him because I didn't want him to feel like he had something wrong with him. Our counselor suggested that we order this book. When it came in I was so excited to read it with him. We sat down and started reading and I was asking him questions pertaining to what we were learning. At one point, he said to me ""I have OCD."" It was like a relief. He didn't feel bad and I think it helped him to actually put a name to what had been an ongoing struggle. We only read it once, because we try not to focus on the OCD, we got the help he needs and my son is thriving."
3,OK for younger kids - 3.5 stars really,"The book was OK but not great.It was overly simplistic and not too meaninful for a teenager or parent. It really only skimmed one aspect of OCD, compulsion, and did not address at all the cause of the compulsion, obsessions.May be more meaningful to younger children..."
2,disappointment,I was more than a bit disappointed in this disc; however I knew it was a remastered mix so should have been prepared.
2,Weak,I bought the book hoping for lots of creative packaging ideas. I want to bake bread and cookied and present to friends and co-workers and the book had a lot of what looked to me like marginal receipes (in fairness I did not try any) but what I was really looking for (and what the title implies) was not there.
5,Very Nice!,"I hurt my back changing the ball so I bought the 3 ball model & have used all 3 balls. Works great, no tools needed to change the balls. I have used 2 other brands & I like this one the best. It also cost less than the other 2 brands."
3,Item received not as pictured,The product I received was not the same as the one that was pictured. What I did receive had the same tow rating. It also had the 3 ball interchangable system.
4,This was great,I really enjoyed this fictional novel. Tananarive Due is one of my favorite authors. She took a very real person and wrote a fictional story. Reading this fictional story about Scott Joplin gave me the desire to learn more about the real person.
2,GOOD BOOK,"A LITTLE DETAIL AT FIRST BUT JUST HANG IN THERE, IT REALLY GETS GOOD. GREAT RESEARCH WAS DONE ON JOPLIN"
5,Oh Tan Due!,"'Tannanananana' Due is truly becoming one of my most favorite writers. But for this one, hold on! It's a back and forth carpet ride!"
5,Fantastic!,"This is my first Tananarive Due novel, but it won't be my last. I am a history buff, and I especially enjoy biographies. When I started this novel I didn't know much about Scott Joplin, but Ms Due so thoroughly researched her subject and characterized Mr Joplin so effectively that I almost feel as if I knew him personally after reading this book. Great writing, great characterizations, great storyline! This was a terrific blend of history, biography, love story and supernatural ghost story that I was enthralled. There were a few stretches that drug a little, but overall it was so good I just kept reading and couldn't put the book down. Great writing. If you read this one you will not be disappointed."
4,Nice mix of history and fiction,"I enjoyed this book by Ms. Due. I was especially impressed with the use of real historical facts about Scott Joplin intertwined with the fictional ghost story. Ms Due always takes the reader on a journey which makes you feel like a part of the story. You simply can not wait to see what happens. In all honesty in my opinion this book didn't flow as well as her other books, but I still think it is a winner and as usual I always enjoy good speculative fiction from Black authors. I can't wait for her next book."
3,Not as good as the others,"I really enjoy reading novels by Tananarive Due. My all time favorite was ""My Soul to Keep."" ""The Between"" and ""The Good House"" were also good. I think she should stick to writing completely fictional novels, instead of referencing and writing about real people (like Madam CJ Walker and Scott Joplin). I found this book a little boring. Maybe I'm too far removed from the hip hop culture."
2,What happened to the old Tananrive???,"I am a huge Tananarive Due fan---My Soul to Keep is one of my favorite books and The Living Blood is not far behind. So it pains me to say just how disappointed I was with Joplin's Ghost. It is clear that Ms. Due has given up her true voice to keep up with urban drivel that has, for some unknown reason, become so popular as of late. Joplin's is an easy read--which is not a good thing, as it lacks the dimension and coplexity of her previous works. The Joplin piece was interesting but the rest of the story tries to be hip and falls way short of the mark. I hope that Ms. Due finds her way back to her voice."
5,FASCINATING READ,"This product was delivered on time and as advertised. Would not hesitate to purchase products from this vendor again should the occasion arise. If you are a black music officianto, a musician, or just like hip hop music check this out its an amazing read full historic info as well as insight into todays hip hop music industry."
5,The Greatest Moments in the Life of Christ,"When was the last time you stopped to smell the roses? To watch a sunrise/sunset with someone you love? Slowing down long enough to stand in awe as God displays Himself anew? I believe that this is the heart of this book...Max is reminding us of how it only takes a moment to radically change our lives-history. Using excerpts from his other writings he has created ""forty-four"" moments from the life of Christ for us to experiance afresh. It is the perfect size to slip into a purse or backpack, so when you have a minute you can find refreshing. Or it can be used as a 'daily devotional'. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who could use a dose of refreshing and encouragement."
1,Not Modern Yesterday....,I was disappointed after the previous work with Modern Yesterday. This just does not have that great sound of MY.
5,Perfect!,I've had this umbrella for a long time now! It's extremely sturdy and when the wind blows it doesn't turn inside out a like a lot of other umbrellas. But I broke it! :( It got caught in my bike wheel and the handle broke off :( Needless to say I'm buying another one! Get it! This umbrella is not only picture perfect but it completes your look cause it makes anything! :)
4,One drawback,"This umbrella looks nice and sturdy. It has strong frame so that it is quite heavy (1 lb) for me as a petite woman.One drawback I noticed after purchasing it is that it requires a little muscle to close the umbrella all the way. (It closes half way automatically by pushing button, though)I think it may be difficult for elderly people or people with arthritis in hands to close the umbrella."
2,Ripped after less than 3 months of use,"While this umbrella is definitely beautiful, and nicely designed, it unfortunately does not hold up to the winds and rains of NYC. After only using for 3 months, one of the spokes ripped off from the fabric. I still use it though, with one spoke sticking out. Hoping to get it replaced by Galleria although I have not yet contacted them about it."
5,Solid & beautiful,"I bought this for mobile shade while walking around at music festivals.I wanted something that was artsy, yet lightly colored to dissipate heat. Being male, I was looking for something beautiful, without being pink and covered in unicorns. Monet is a Win. This still might be considered a bit feminine, but it's well within my tolerances.It's quite large actually, and amazingly sturdy. Compacts down small enough to sit in my backpack water bottle side-pouch. It does not come with a case, which is fine, as that's just something for me to lose.Opening action is swift and easy. It's easily the coolest umbrella I have ever owned."
4,Beauty & function,"This umbrella is beautiful, works very well (even on windy days) and opens quickly with the press of a button. Closing not quite as effortless, but certainly not difficult (I expected it to retract to small size-but you must do this by hand). Not a flaw, just not what I expected. All in all it adds a bit of fun to otherwise gloomy days and seems to be well made."
5,Keep up the good work!,Just finished reading Wanton! This book should've been put out in the dead of winter because it is HOT! It is a keeper for sure and I can see myself reading it more than twice!
1,"boring, boring ,boring","I know that I am in the minority but Wanton was all in all a really big dissapointment. I'm usually a big Lori Foster she knows how to turn in the heat, usually, but Wanton left me cold."
2,Not so revved up over the product,"I bought these for my grandson, he was thrilled to receive them and enjoyed them for about an hour. He then realized they didn't do much else, so he played with them less and less. After about the 4th time one glove quit working altogether. They became yard sale merchandise."
3,It's okay!,"Although I am sure that this product is fine, I would rather use neosporin. It seems to work faster. Thank you!"
1,Too wide,"The band on these shoes is too wide for the stated size, not a little bit, but close to two sizes too wide. Consequently, the shoes give the wearer a very unstable feeling. I would have never bought these shoes no matter what the price had I been able to try them on before buying. Dr. Scholl's people don't seem to realize that having padded soles on shoes does not make them comfortable if your feet cannot hang on to them while walking."
1,I should have believed a previous review,The straps were too loose all across the instep. I should have believed a caveat from a former purchaser.
3,interesting old recordings,Perhaps these are not the better recordings you would choose for your first time. Neither the discs you would listen in a sadly night. But here you have got something than is not usual in a new disc. Different sounds in the recordings that show us the point of view of other times. That is enough to put this disc between a complete cd library of Mahler.
1,"Good relaxing tool but, not useful for fears and phobias","After listening to this CD several times, I realized that it helped me relax but did not help with fears & phobias."
1,you get what you pay for,"have you ever heard the saying "" You get what you pay for""? Well with E business in a box, this statement is true. Lousy customer service, lousy designers and lousy website. I got a generic website design and when I complained they told me that THEY PUT THE NEW DESIGNERS ON THE E-BUSINESS ACCOUNTS AS THESE ARE THE LOWEST LEVEL. Yes, they told me that. They agreed to give me a new more qualified designer. I still ended up with a generic site. When I complained again they told me if I upgraded (payed more money) I could get a better site. If you want a professinal site DO NOT use E-business in a box. If you are a grandmother who is selling your knitting in your spare time and what a site so your family can see it then this might be for you. but... still I doubt it"
3,Not a bad deal at all,"Quick and easy, just don't try to get real gung-ho with the web design. This is basic stuff. A square product for a fair price."
3,a book wrongly identified by amazon,"this book does not contain peter schneider's ""the wall jumper,"" as the amazon book notice asserts; it contains his short novella ""lenz."" other than this rather substantial and baffling mislabeling, the novellas are important and poignant examinations of german, and particularly east german, lives."
4,A library at hand,Now you can enjoy knowledge by simply pressing some buttons! With my Franklin pocket dictionary encyclopedia I have the right answer at the right time... always!
5,wonderful patriotic song,"I was overseas in the military when our nation was attacked. After that day the base played this song over the loud speakers every evening before taps. It entails the feeling of patriotism and pride that I feel while I serve this, the greatest country in the world."
1,This game is not built for PC,This game is not built for PC. It has no controls for PC. You will need to buy a gaming console and attach it to your PC in order to play this game.
1,WORTHLESS - DO NOT BUY!,"I have a new, high-end gaming pc that exceeds all of the recommended specs, and this game will not run.Do not waste your money!"
5,The Dubs are AWESOME!,"I love this CD. It truly captures the heart of the Young Dubliners. They enjoy playing the music and they love putting on a great show for their fans. You will not be bored listening to this CD. The band keeps their Irish roots alive with traditional Irish favorites, and original material with an Irish flair. This is slammin rock & roll! Nothing like headbanging while doing the Irish jig!!!"
5,A life time of magical knowledge by the master of the art,"Aleister Crowley is in fine form here dispensing esoteric philosophy and step by step instructions on some of the most important and powerful magickal practices and ceremonies. The writing is carefully worded so that even beginners can grasp the concepts and gain insight from this most valuable text book. The book embodies two of Crowley's most important and famous works ""Liber legis""(THE BOOK OF THE LAW)and ""magick in theory and practice."" The writing on yoga is among the finest i've ever read on the subject anywhere and is absolutly revolutionary for it's time. Crowley encompasses such a vast body of information in this book that it never fails to teach the student something new each time it is referenced.Anyone interested in pursuing the great work will find this an invaluable edition to their library.The beast may have indeed been mortal but his words shall endure until the end.PERDURABO!"
2,Content is great but print is hard to read,"This book brings together all four parts of Book ABA by Alesiter Crowley. While the effort is commendable, the result is slightly below par. I would highly recommend purchasing the books in separate editions. Save you eyesight for magick."
4,excellent book but not recommended as crowleys first reads,"It ""Do what thou wilt"", meaning ""Do what you were meant to do in this life""As in follow your path. Your destiny.Not ""Do whatever you feel like doing.""for those who are just beginning to study Thelema, or have just begun the process of wading through Crowley's works (or just want to research Thelema in-general), I strongly suggest beginning with: ""The Magick of Thelema: A Handbook of the Rituals of Aleister Crowley,"" by Lon Milo Duquette (ISBN # 0877287783)."
1,Bill Breeze (H. Beta) does it again,"How many of these ""new edtions"" are needed? this book had been reviesed so many times that the Aeon of Maat will be here before there is a ""final"" copy. My suggestion is to go find a copy of the originals from a used bookstore and use those. You will pay less, and think/learn just as much... not to mention the fact that you will not be giving money to those who are trying to live off of Crowley's work without doing any of their own (material work as well as spiritual work...)"
1,"Magick: Book 4, Liber Aba","Horribly misleading. This is advertised with a picture of Magick: Book 4, Liber Aba, but is in fact, a bad paperback reprint. Information is missing and content has been edited. If you are looking to order this book, look elsewhere for a supplier. I got ripped off."
2,a little cheesy,"As a young person for whom this series is intended, I have nothing to say but DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! The principles addressed are very relevant but can be conveyed in a less condescending, cheesy way. Those who can direct, do make good movies, I suppose - and those who can't, just do really bad training videos! Sorry!(It would be okay, I suppose, if it were free...)"
5,"DB : BOLD , fast paced Action , Comedy and a Daring movie","DB : BOLD Bollywood movie by Aamir Khan .DB is a BOLD , fast paced Action , Comedy and a Daring movie.Story Line : The journey of three roommates in the suburbs of Delhi when the delivery of a mystery package goes wrong, and they unknowingly become the potential prey of a ruthless gangster.The whole movie has been shot in New Delhi .All the characters in the movie has done a great job . The trio acted naturally...The dialogs in the movie are not double meaning dialogs like the older David dhavans movie . Dialogs are straight forward.There are two reasons why DB might not work in all masses : 90% of the movie is in English , secondly the language used in Movie is A grade ( The movie has A certificate) .DB is worth a watch. Not to be watched with your Kid or Elders in house . Only for Mature Audience. Have a Fun laugh ride.Will i watch it 2nd time ? YES YES YES ...... :-)"
5,Not what was expected,"We rented this on the basis of its ""difference"" and were very pleasantly surprised. Very funny and well done with some good twists."
2,Disappointed!,"I am disappointed with this backpack. I bought it because I got a 17"" sony vaio. I can put my laptop inside the backpack but then it is difficult to close the bag! Besides, once the laptop is inside, I can not put many other stuff.It is disappointed because this SONY backpack should fit my SONY vaio !"
5,GREAT CLASSIC ALBUM IN CD,"WOW, I have been searching for this CD for over ten years. Especially for the one track ""It's all in the way you get down"". The whole album was very good, and I just couldn't find it in CD, Imagine my surprise when I found it from a vendor on amazon.It arrived on time and in perfect condition, even though it was used. Even the art work was exactly like the original cover of the album, I had so many years ago. Obviously I am very pleased with this purchase and would use this vendor again."
3,Pretty Good,"there are some good songs here but Ray Parker Jr&Raydio found a Formula vibe&ran with it on this Set.""A Woman needs Love"" was a Good Song.but you can tell Ray struck Cross-Over Pay Dirt&wasn't looking back.this is a Bit Pricy lucky Me I heard the album back in the day&still can hear the Jams on LP.but i like the Raydio&Ray Parker Jr stuff from 78&79 better overall."
5,Perfect fit,"This belt is a perfect fit for my ML350, 2007. Very easy to DIY, I watched youtube first, only tools needed are 1) 17mm box spanner and 2) a lock pin. I used 2 inch nail for the lock pin, it worked, took me just a few minutes to replace. At this moment, the engine back on running great, the squigee sound disappeared. I will update about the quality of the belt a few months later,"
5,Best purchase ever!!!,"The best thing I have ever purchased! Being affraid to death of heights, this has paid for itself in the fact that I don't have buy anti-anxiety meds just to climb my ladder! Worked perfectly....within ten minutes, I changed three bulbs in my fan that is about 17 ft high. Love, love, love this product!!! Highly recommend!!!"
3,Needs more info on function keys,"Good book, but neglects the importance of time saving function keys or ON KEY LABELs."
1,"Waste of time, paper, and money","There would be some benefit from this book if you could weed out the cutesy comments, but it's just too hard to do. On every page are numerous sentences to waste your time. When programming and studying you need to concentrate. You don't want to see ""(and Santa)"" when reading about clauses. There is a section called ""Doing it in public"" and it asks things like ""Can you offer a subroutine a good home?"" Hey, can you give me a break?You can't find what you want either. There are 953 pages. And the table of contents is only 2 pages. It would fit even on one page if you removed Benjamin Franklin's epitaph that takes up half of the first page. (No kidding - They really added B.F.'s epitaph to a FoxPro book.) But, a table of contents at any length is no good when the chapter titles are things like ""Your server will be with you in a moment"" and ""OOP is not an accident."" You know, ""Mom was right"", the section titles are even more worthless."
1,Pretentious Quotes! No Thanks!,"Unfortunately for me, however good this book is as a reference and it is good, on nearly every page there are irrelevant and pretentious quotations from everything from the Bible to Ghandi. By the time I reached page 20, I threw up. This style of writing only gives credence to the concept that programmers are total geeks!"
1,A bad copy of VFP documentation,Actually this book is Language Reference of VFP.If you are a professional developer buy another book.
4,"Not so ""Fox-y"" without the CD ROM",Before buying...you may want to know that the CD ROM has to be ordered separately or you can download the info from a URL included in the book. Just thought you'd like to be warned. Otherwise...no major complaints.
5,Tamar and Ted's Biggest FoxPro Book Ever!,Stop banging your head against VFP infelicities! This book represents a phenomenal investment in time and effort by Tamar and Ted that you dont have to repeat. Pays for itself the first time you use it!
2,NOT a good book to learn FoxPro!,"Rip the first few chapters out of this book and it is a pretty good reference book. However, before figuring out that this is ONLY a reference book the reader must suffer through 150 pages of ridiculous ""dummies"" book snippets. I tend to read my new technical books front to back the first time. But I came very close to dropping this book in the trash before I realized there was worthwhile material behind the first three chapters of dribble. If you're trying to learn FoxPro, buy something else!"
5,The Must-Have reference volume for VFP 6.0,"Hacker's Guide is a definite requirement for any VFP developer's library. The coverage of the language is unrivaled by any other book, and Ted and Tamar give you the real low down (including bug documentation). The CHM file is set up as my VFP help file."
1,Hacker's Guide to Visual FoxPro 6.0,"I am new to Visual Foxpro after many years of using Foxpro for DOS 2.0 and I thought that this book would help me learn Visual Foxpro.The authors state in the beginning of the book that if you are looking to learn Visual Foxpro from a beginners level then this book isn't for you. The authors state that the book is an intermediate level book.The book is mainly a glorified help menu like what you would find if you clicked on the help tab at the top of a program. The book didn't help me in trying to learn Visual Foxpro. I needed a book that would explain the concepts of Object-Oriented-Programming and this book didn't do it for me.If you already know Visual Foxpro then perhaps the information in this book might come in handy, otherwise don't waste your money.I wish that I had known this before I spent my money on a used copy of this book. Hopefully my review will keep someone else from making the same mistake."
2,"While a good reference book, not for learning VFP","I purchased this book with the idea that it had EVERYTHING you needed to know in using Visual FoxPro 6.0. It turned out to be a language reference guide. Forms design, etc. are not covered by this book. I would only recommend buying this book if you are already a ""hardened"" FoxPro programmer."
1,Look at before you buy,I am currently using this book for a Business Communications class. I have to say it is by far the worst book I've used in my college career to date. I talked to one instructor who said she changed books because the examples in this book were so bad. She even went through the effort of re-designing the course just to switch books. That is how bad this book is. If the instructor you are going to take a class from recommends this book please do yourself a favor and find an instructor who has the courtesy to search for a book that will allow you to excel in this type of class. This is not the book to help you do that.
5,A classic text of the civil rights-black power era!,"Home is essential reading for any serious student of the 1960s, particularly the Black Revolt. Standing next to such classics as The Autobiography of Malcolm X and Soul on Ice, it is one of the best accounts of the Black search for identity and liberation. Here we see Baraka's political evolution. The essays are arranged chronologically, tracing his development from ""Cuba Libre,"" an evocative account of his first experience with the Cuban Revolution, to his definition of the legacy of the fallen leader, Malcolm X. No study of the Black Revolt of the 1960s is complete without a reading of ""Home,"" written by one of the founders of the Black Arts Movement."
1,Dissapointing.,"I don't wanna be mean. But this book really lacks in a lot of things. The pictures were griany. The plot points seem to pop out of no where. there's also no original dialogue. I don't wanna trash the author completely. All I wanna say is . . .try again, man."
3,"A good, solid intro to the wonderfull ""Forgotten Terror"".","This is a good, solid game, though a bit on the short side. I reccomend that you write your own encounters, because the ones in it are super-easy. It's relatively easy to run, except for an optional mini-advenure that takes place in a small, Selune-worshipping town that no ones really heard of. This part was very badly done. This game is a short, fun adventure worth buying. It is also neccisary to play this game before the awsome ""Forgotten Terror""."
5,Plaid Phonics:Level A,"This is a very old series of consumable workbooks that is beginning to be tauted among home educators. I used it in the early eighties and it isn't appreciatively different than what I used as a child more than forty years ago. It has plenty of wonderful pictures and concentrates on learning that leads to proper reading ability. The illustrations aren't as wild and hard to identify as many modern workbooks. It's a complete year""s worth of work though my children always rush through faster. It's fun and gives a real sense of accomplishment without triteness. t"
4,Historical Mystery,"Diana Spaulding, a crime reporter for the New York Independent, Intelligencer is back in the second entry in the series. Despite being estranged from her parents, Diana travels to Colorado after learning not only that her mother is accused of murdering her tycoon father, but that her parents were divorced. Diana arrives in Denver to try to help her mother, only to learn that her mother now makes a living as a Madam. There is no shortage of suspects since her father was not very well liked.Set in 1888, Kathy Lynn Emerson does a good job setting the mood of the time. The book is rich in atmospheric detail blending historical fact with fiction. Diana is a very likable, spunky heroine. The plot well-paced and offered a few twists and turns to keep the pages turning."
5,Has It All !,"Emerson's mysteries have so much to offer. This one takes place in and around Denver, CO. It brings to life in the 1880's places I've visited myself and wondered about. The mystery is a genuine puzzle, and the pieces gradually fit together until everything is clear by the end. It has suspense, well developed characters, and great historical detail. I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to enjoy a good novel."
4,Fun adventure,This series are fun old fashioned adventures. Pure escapism. I'll l filed the second one as much as the first.
4,Peter and the Wolf (RSO),I have the original on LP and I can tell you that this is the coolest version of Peter & the Wolf you or your kids will ever listen to.
2,Not Pleased,"As an American Girl fan and collector I looked forward to watching this movie. The acting was great, the actors looked the part and it was lovely seeing all of the houses and such from that time period. What I didin't like is that they totally changed the order of more than 10 different scenes. They were all scrambled up and not anywhere near the order of the books. Also some quotes were also totally scrambled and were moved to different characters than who originally said them in the book. They also totally changed the ending with Jiggy Nye and it was really over done. All in all I gave the movie a 2 out of 5 stars. Some good things but overall the books were much better and the movie was scrambled up in every way."
4,Felicity movie is a hit,My daughter (9) loves this movie. She loves the American girl Felicity. It brings her character to life. It also is very close to what happens in the first books for Felicity. Very wholesome entertainment.
4,Cute story for girls,"Cute story about a girl who falls in love with an abused horse, and how she befriends it and tames it, and befriends the owner who changes his abusive ways after her act of kindness to him. Nice story that shows children that you can have differences of opinion, and still be friends."
5,Felicity an American Girl DVD,"This is a fabulous family movie. I purchased it because my daughter is a huge American Girl fan, and my entire family (including Grandparents) sat together for the entire movie. It gives incite into what the younger generation went through during the times leading up to the American Revolution. If you love history and want to be able sit down with the entire family get this movie."
2,what was that,"I hope to save you from watching this. It starts bad and well there were a couple of laughs, weak laughs. Only one actor in the movie was good, he guy that helps the eavil alian con... good juob for him. I recognized a coupl eof the actors and you would expect more from them. Main comic guy, well, he has done better. At least it was about Evil Alien Con...s I guess I needed to be high (whcih I don't do anymore)."
4,Great Keyboard,I purchased this keyboard for my 88 year old mother-in-law who suffers from glaucoma and macular degeneration. She has no problem using the Keys-U-See keyboard. She is now responding to her emails and surfing the web with ease. Highly recommended for users with impaired vision.
2,Spacer key doesn't work,"It is no fun typing on this keyboard because the spacer bar is hit or miss, with a lot of misses. I've tried all kinds of finger taps, from mild to heavy and still this board makes me do a lot of unnecessary work by not spacing words. Everything else works. Typing this review I had 5 no-space events."
2,OK but not great quality,"I bought three of these about a year ago.Two yellow, one black.One failed, that is when you type a letterit repeats itself thousands of times. Tested ontwo computers, so its defective.The black one has a wrong letter. The 'R' key is labeled'S', so there are two 'S' keys. One would think alarge letter keyboard would not have this mistake.Poor workmanship, and quickly defective.Where is the warranty?Avoid this product like the plague."
5,Highly Visible Keyboard Plus Extras,"The KeysUSee keyboard is not only extremely easy to read but has hot keys for many commonly uses functions on your pc. It takes up a little more room than my old keyboard. Setup is automatic, just plug and play. Great for low light conditions. You may need to prop up the back for a good angle."
4,Very easy to read.,"This is the second yellow keyboard I have had. The first one was a cheap one and within 6 months the letters were starting to wear off the keys. Haven't really had this one long enough, so can't say for sure if this one will be better. The keyboard itself I really like. On a negative note. The keyboard I received had a small piece broken off from a corner - the blame would be on the seller for that. Keyboard still worked so kept it."
1,Keys malfunction,"I had this keyboard for less than a year. I like the large letters, but the keys malfunction. Specifically, the buttons located at the top of the keyboard for volume and navigation controls misbehave. First time it happened was a few months after the purchase when the buttons would all generate a Home function. In other words, each of the above button will send the web page to its home page. I sent emails to the seller and the manufacturer but there was no response. After a while the problems went away, only to reappear about a month ago. There is one more problem I noticed. If I am typing in a Word document, every now and then the keyboard will send a ctrl code which would want to make the document exit. It is quite annoying. I think the circuitry underneath is hosed up."
3,keyboard,Its OK: but rather a dramatic color for your desk.after a month : I found that the E & F keysduplicate when struck. (strange)// Keys-U-See*They're right about that aspect !! D.
3,Its only advantage is visibility,"This keyboard does exactly what it's advertised to do: enable people who are partially blind to see it. But beyond that, this keyboard falls flat, primarily because there is zero tactile feedback and zero audible feedback. My wrists and fingers were sore five minutes after I began using it. For typing, the only worse keyboards I've used in my lifetime are the old Sun Sparcstation keyboards and the old DEC VT100 keyboards with the electronic keyclick disabled. So, if you don't absolutely positively need keycaps with large print in order to use a computer, avoid this keyboard. I'm giving this one to my dad, who hunts and pecks and who's got cataracts. It will be a net positive for him, as will be the case for anyone who can't see the keys on a ""normal"" keyboard -- but just barely."
1,Problems out of the box,"I got this as a gift for my elderly parents; right out of the box several of the keys didn't work. I replaced it with a new one for them, and again some of the keys don't work. They use it anyway, but are limited in their ability to use some keys."
5,This keyboard really make a big difference!,"I purchased this keyboard for a family member who suffers from macular degeneration. It was quick and easy for him to install, and the black on yellow makes a big difference. The hot keys allow it to be set up for ZoomText features without the added cost (more than double) of a ZoomText brand keyboard. Highly recommended!"
2,"Keys you can see, but that don't always work...","Purchased this for my husband, who is legally blind. The large lettering on the keys and contrasting colors are great, but the feedback from the keys is extremely poor. The keys feel ""mushy"" when trying to touch-type. Also, sometimes he would have to press a key several times before it would actually type the letter/number. Maybe we got a dud keyboard and the springs/sensors for some of the keys were shot. If you usually touch-type and only sometimes need to look at the keys, I dont' know if I would buy this keyboard. There are other large print keyboards available from other manufacturers that might have better feedback, although they are not as inexpensive as this."
4,Large Print Keyboard - excellent,Great purchase with great yellow letters. Installed easily with no added software. Construction is a little cheap but overall it works well.
4,Easier,Much easier to use than the black keys with small white letters. The yellow is easier on the eyes as well.
5,Very good product,...the buttons are large and stand right up ..a very nice keyboard to use and the extra features work very nice !
2,Clunky,"Backspace key didn't work consistently. Key travel was clunky, not for touch typists. You can definitely see the keys on this one, though. I returned this due to the defective backspace key."
2,"without replacement heads, this is a useless toothbrush","I really liked this toothbrush, but I was unable to find replacement heads on Amazon, at Walmart, Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, anywhere. I am discouraged from buying any similar toothbrush again in fear that the replacement heads will be discontinued as soon as I do. I am sticking with manual."
3,Not a hit.,Purchased for my grandson. This is one of his least played with Star Wars characters. Not a waste though. When he plays with his character's he does incorporate this character into his play.
5,Martial arts at it's best,"This Dvd has something for everyone wanting to learn Kung Fu. It teaches the basic atances, kicks and strikes of Wudang Kung Fu. Anyone can start out with the basic section of this DVD..then progress along. For the experienced the DVD teaches a Wudang sequence..or Kata. I plan on learning the kata and adding it to my practice. Daoist monk Zhou Xuan Yun is a very good teacher. He demonstrates and breaks down the finer details of the moves which isn't always included in training DVD's. As a 5th degree black belt in Chinese Kenpo, I highly recommend this dvd to beginners and to advanced prationers."
1,i like it,"well interpreted i love it may refer a friend to have one, its simple and easy to use. keep it up."
5,kids love this,i have a daughter in vocal lessons and she absolutely loves this cd.great fun for all and in great condition
2,Oh no!,"Don't bother, better find yoself w/ARU @ the GA THEATRE, or in the mirrors of embarassment...just NOT my cup of tea! ZAMBI where are you?!"
5,"NY Times Tough Crossword Puzzles, Vol. 9","A thought-provoking group of puzzles--not as hard as Saturday puzzles, but close. An enjoyable few hours of puzzle solving.It's nice, too, that W. Shortz includes the names of the puzzle constructors--a hard, time-consuming occupation."
3,Won't work outdoors,I got a chance to demo one from the store I work at. It worked great indoors. As soon as I step outside it started cutting in and out on me.I even took it home for the day just to make sure it wasn't the environment. Did the same thing. I'm so dissapointed cause I really liked them.Now I don't know if the device I tested is defective or if they all have this same problem. I'm afraid to spend my money on one.
1,Didn't work for me at all...,"I purchased this product for use with Skype on my PC. It was time consuming to set up and when it was finally set up it never worked fully, nor well. I would recommend seeking another product if you want a wireless connection to Skype on your PC."
1,Not a High End Product Like Others,"This is NOT COMPATIBLE with other great devices like my Sony Ericsson S710a cell phone, my eMac, or my newest G4 iBook Macintosh. I can make and receive calls, but why would I purchase a pair of headphones just to talk on the phone. I can't listen to music or movies for jack and am very disappointed with my purchase.I will never purchase or consider Motorola a high end product EVER AGAIN!"
1,Headset does not allow you to listen to iTunes on mobile phones,"To be clear - this headset will NOT allow you to listen to iTunes on an iTune enabled mobile phone like the SLVR not in bluetooth mode or using the cable. It will allow you to make calls, etc. on the phone but DO NOT expect to be able to listen to iTunes on the Phone and be able to answer a call that comes in on the mobile phone. This product is seriously flawed. As suggested in other reviews it is because the ""profile"" that supports what i have describes is not available in any american mobile phone and will not be (This came direct from a Motorola supervisor of customer support)."
1,Misleading advertising,I wanted to pair this headset with my Cingular 8125 to listen to music at the gym. The packaging makes it seem like you can pair with your phone to listen to music. The truth is you cannot you have to pair with your phone to answer calls and pair with another audio device to listen to music. Maybe this is weird but what a waste of a product. If your that worried about missing a call just listen to your stereo and save the $120.00. Motorola really missed the boat for what most people will want on this product. Not to mention their box should more explicitly state how the headphones work.
2,OK at first...,"I was basically buying this for listening to movies on the Samsung Blackjack. The Bluetooth protocol really slows down the phone. It is OK for music, but too slow for movies. The Samsung earbud (non-Bluetooth) works, but hurts my ears. So I bought a Blackjack analog universal audio adapter to output to this HT820. I only hear garbage for audio. If I plug in the HT820 to computer speakers, sound is OK. If I plug the Blackjack to computer speakers from the adapter, sound is OK. If I plug in the Blackjack to analog input of HT820, sound is garbage! I tried several in-between cables, but no luck."
3,Does not work with iPod portion of iPhone,"Works as advertised with the iPhone. Sound quality is decent for phone calls. However, it does not work as a music player if your music player is an iPhone (I have the original iPhone). Apparently, the iPod portion of the iPhone does not have the A2DP capability, which is required for listening to stereo music. I read all the reviews here before buying, and saw all the positive comments about music playing. I should have dug in a little deeper to learn that these will not play music from the iPhone. Otherwise, they seem OK."
4,"C. Rhoades ""CRhoades"" review is factually incorrect.","At the time of writing the ""Cingular 8125"" smartphone DOES NOT SUPPORT A2DP STEREO BLUETOOTH AUDIO. This headset would work great with devices that DO support this profile.The reviewer did not take the time to review the specifications of the device he was trying to use the headphones with. If you do a google search many people have had success with OTHER phones which do support this profile."
2,"Works If You have A2DP , But the band Cuts your Ears","It is bulky , and I look like Princess Leia when I have it on. The band is flat and sharp and it cuts the top of your ears.I was able to get the Stereo to work with my Windows Mobile 5 Phone (Cingular 8125/HTC wizard) after installing a program I downloaded for free. If your phone has A2DP already, you should be good to go.The plastic of the band is stiff, and It broke on me. Now I am unable to use it. I got excited with Motorola's new Version of the stereo headset, but so far the reviews for that on Amazon have been unsatisfactoryBOTTOM LINE: You will like it if = You dont mind the Princess Leia Look; If you have A2DP on your phone (or kow how to set it up); If you have a smaller Head and smaller ears;"
2,Speaker quality is fair,"I purchased this product simply because I often work in an enviroment with background noise. I have tried the single ear devices but they dont address the issue of you still being able to hear residual noises with the other ear. SO, I purchased this device and found it to be fair. Not great, just fair. The reason is simple, A new headset should not have a speaker that vibrates and sounds like it is blown. The concept works, the stereo headset is exactly as I planned, but the speaker quality is suspect."
4,In my opinion,"I have both the this HT820 and S9 from Motorola for use with my iPod. The HT820 is by far more comfortable for extended wear time, and has a better stereo sound. It is bulkier that the S9, but my interest was sound quality. These HT820 are discontinued; so if you can find a set you better go ahead and buy it."
3,Careful that nothing sits on them - EVER,"I've had these for a while and liked them. If I wear them for more than 30 minutes, the top of my ears against my head hurt. I was willing to put up with that because I liked the wireless aspect, and they sounded good. The ear cushion is great, it's just the weight pushing the rubber shark fin piece against your ears that hurts after a while.Recently I laid them down at work over the weekend. I guess I laid them down incorrectly, because they are now misshapen. Once that happens, you are out of luck. They will no longer fit against your ears.So they sound great, but no longer fit. I think the ear pieces are just too heavy and it relies on the plastic head/neck band piece to maintain an exact shape.Anyway, I am disappointed and will not buy this model again."
3,Not terrible for the price,"Had I paid more for these pans I'd have to rate them lower. Given the price I view them as ""disposable"" and in that context they aren't bad. The nonstick surface is incredibly delicate and is scratching off after only a few uses. They are very lightweight and don't have a sturdy feel due to that."
4,Great Pans at a great price!,"These pans are light and thin, but man do they mean it when they say they are non-stick. I literally don't need to put any spray in them at all and the most burnt on items slide right off upon washing. There are certainly better pans out there, but not for this price."
5,Excellent story; excellent reading,"We borrowed this from the library a couple of times before buying it as a gift for a friend. My husband, my children (ages 6-10) and I all LOVE it and listen to parts of it over and over. We love how the different stories of the book are woven seamlessly together -- there's nothing forced about it nor do the story lines get confusing. I love the detail author Alan Armstrong gives about botany and the merchant life of the Dick Whittington story line.I have raved before and will again about the reading by Joel Brooks. His ability to do different voices is amazing.I highly recommend this for all age groups."
2,An Award Winner?,"I have read 7 chapters of this book so far, and I absolutely cannot understand how it won an award for anything. The sentences are choppy and dull and a lot of the paragraphs just have a lot of details thrown together. If a kid turned in paragraphs to me like the ones I read in this book, I would make him redo them. Honestly. It I had known, I wouldn't have taken this book for free."
1,Nice Cover,This book looked great on the cover in full color and a modern shop. You get inside for the little bit of pictures they do have are all old and black and white. This is one for the yard sale.
1,Waste of Time,"First of all, she spends too much time talking about herself and her beliefs before she gets to the hypnosis. You have to fast-forward, screen, etc... Secondly, as someone with a chronic illness, her views that all illnesses are self-created and can be self-cured are EXTREMELY INSULTING! The ""Love Tapes"" (just a name) are SO MUCH BETTER, and no, I don't get a commission for that."
2,After 6 months. .,"Got one, seemed GREAT, after onlyabout 6 uses jumping, and a couple with the air compressor. . it wont jump anymore.. lights work, leds are fine, compressor (was) working. now only the led lights will come on.70$ wasted.Thanks Motortrend.G"
2,A Big Yawn,"Unless your interest lies in Solomonic magick (and it's more than just curiosity), don't waste your time or money. This must be one of the most boring dvds I've ever viewed. There are more interesting videos out there. This dvd is very little about Wicca and very much about Solomonic practises."
2,to introductory and not enough substance,"it's so introductory,it's an overview to be exact at least that is my opinion. i'm sure this man knows his craft,but i think more details should have went into this. i would have appreciated more information and details than i do that 'extra' 'fantasy movie' that's included as an extra. the quality of the DVD was okay."
3,good information,I felt this film had a good overview of the OTA's. The basic information it provides is a good stepping stone for expanding knowledge in the field.
3,Basic overview. Its OK,Its the basic overview of the OTAs other rituals and beliefs. There's only 20 or so minutes on each topic and its very introductory. It doesn't get deep into anything. Compared to The Magic of Solomon which was beginning to end. And unlike the magic of Solomon there wasn't anything as innovative as say how to use the magic mirror. The ritual was well done. It had the feel of a brochure video selling the OTA rather then a learning tool. The quality of the video is OK.
3,This sounds like so many,other country songs. The melodies are unoriginal and the mix is similar to so many songs.
1,TYPICAL PORN COUNTRY!,"I agree...look at the cover!! It looks like an ad for porn and the music is absolutely degrading! There are poor people, then there are white trash people. This offering is for the white trash people."
2,Gretchen Wilson,"Gretchen seems to have a pretty good range. Although her lyrics seem overly simply, she just says whats she thinks. This album was rushed to production upon the heels of the hugely popular Redneck Girls. And indeed it shows a bit. There are a few very good songs, Redneck Girl of course and the ballads, When I think About Cheating and What Happened will make you think. When It Rains is a fun, 2-steppy country shuffle that will make you tap your feet. However, Here For The Party and Homewrecker should have stayed in the her personal songbook. They sound like they were looking for any material quickly to fill the album.Not bad for a hurried work. But after ""Redneck"" -I expected a little more meat. Hope she will take her time, next album. I would like to see what she can really do."
1,i love trailer parks,"Wow, Just another 'cookie cutter' country singer. I wonder how she made it into the music business. Just goes to show you white trash can do anything when they set their mind to. Who in their right mind is proud to be trashy. She ran out of things to say. No offense to those who actually live in a trailer park."
1,What a horrible CD!,"I bought this CD thinking maybe I'd give it a try. I'm a huge country fan, and have listened to it all my life. But wow, this CD wasn't worth it at all. I regret buying it completely. When I hear her songs on the radio, I literally turn it off and wait for it to end. She's just awful. The only singer I can't stand, I don't even really consider her country."
1,GO GET DRUNK AND HAVE A PARTY!!,"Why not? That's the message this CD seems to be imparting. No class (not even low) throughout the entire proceedings. Get a joint or two as well and you'll have even more fun. Oh, and don't forget that along with all the booze and the drugs, get in a little romp in the you know what, if you know what I mean. If you're into all that stuff, this CD is for you and this is where country music is headed. I won't spend anymore money supporting or buying this kind of trash. Oh, and don't forget the pink flamingos out in the front yard to add a little taste to your party!!"
1,Holy Crap! 0 stars!,"This woman tells the whole world that she's a redneck, like that's a good thing. It's not. Jeff Foxworthy makes fun of rednecks because they are the trashiest low lives in the country. They have no class and apparently this girl wants the whole world she doesn't either. Radio stations that play this are seriously degrading themselves."
5,"REAL COUNTRY, NO UNWARRANTED HYPE!","Gretchen really shines in this debut album. The mud on her boots in the picture speaks volumes for how her songs convey her real, country background. She does not try to be a country beauty (even thought she is!), nor does she try to please everybody by being political. Her music on this CD is just good 'ole down home harmonies, hard rockin' party songs, and real southern Americana. ALL country fans will like this CD, and those who do not consider themselves country fans, will undoubtedly find their feet tappiing when they hear ""Redneck Woman."""
3,It's not what everyone said,"I bought this album for one song, ""When I think about cheatin'"" and I love that song, unfortunately that is the only good one. All the other songs sound pretty much the same, that country-rock singing all about partying."
1,gritty tomboy garbage,"Horrible music, even makes country look bad and thats bad!!! Like nails on a chalkboard"
4,Redneck Woman!,I Like This CD i'm a country fan So I Like this CDTrack Listing From Worst To Best:What Happend 5/10Chariot 5.4/10When I Think About Cheatin' 5.4/10Homewrecker 5.6/10Holdin' You 5.6/10The Bed 6/10When It Rains 8/10Pocahontas Proud 8/10Here For The Party 10/10Redneck Woman 11/10I Dont like Chariot that much because she does a rapThis CD I Would Give It 98/100
2,She shore is purty,"I gave her two stars just for looks. Outside of her looks her talent is not evident. Don't you just love the, ""crowd"" chanting the chorus on Redneck Woman? Which is funny seeing that song isn't live. Poor Patsy Cline is rolling in her grave. Someone said this cd made them a real country fan, what a joke. Country music is about heart, it's not about adding to the stereotypical southern image of getting drunk and partying. Go ahead and buy this and then a few months will pass and it will become, ""old"". Then you will realize that real country music is not about becoming old because it is timeless."
3,*NOT* WHAT I EXPECTED,"I bought this CD expecting a CD full of songs similar to that of Redneck Woman, but was proved wrong. This CD was made to be into something it wasn't. I would NOT encourage buyers to purchase this album, I love Gretchen..but sadly, it is a waste of money."
3,Good,"If you like country music this is an alright CD. The songs that I liked, I loved, but the ones I didn't like, I skipped, so I couldn't even tell you what they were. The CD has a mixture of different kinds of country on it, it's not all ""I'm Here for the Party"" lyrics (which i love). I could leave some of the slower songs though."
1,**ryan**,this cd is not worth buying she trys to hard to sound like someone else i would not buy this cd today or even the next one ihated this cd
4,Rockin' Cd,"This is a great album, between the party songs like ""Redneck Woman"" and the soul songs like ""When I think about cheatin'"" it has something for everyone. The only thing that bothered me was the slower songs--I felt like Wilson's voice just wasn't suited well for those songs. But they were still good nevertheless, just not great."
4,Great for Highway Driving!!,"Upbeat and tuneful. Ms. Wilson is a wonderful songwriter and has a strong, beautiful voice."
5,Surprised,I'm not a really big country fan by any means.I was really surprised how much I liked this album. I'm more of a pop person. It is very rare that I find a country album that I like and actually buy. I was very pleased. Hell I like her so much I am going to see her in concert this weekend.
1,another Made for TV Act,"Country is no different than ,Pop,R&B,Rap in Making up certain acts that truly have no business being taking as recording artists let alone One Hit wonders.Gretchen Wilson is riding the same Road of country that has spunned alot of Hit Acts but at the same time alot of modern acts short on any real Musical Substance."
5,REAL country music,"Please, this is not pop influenced commercialized country music. If you'd listen to the lyrics and learn anything about Gretchen herself, this girl has lived what she sings about. You can't get more real than that. She also doesn't have to work to get the good 'ole down home twang in her voice like glitzy 'nashville elite' country artists like Faith and Shania. Gretchen's sticking with what she knows and all of us Redneck Women out there know it. This album comes highly recommended from North Carolina."
5,Gretchen is as down to earth as they come,"All of you who trashed this CD ought to remember what music is all about. It's supposed to make you feel good (or feel something). This girl knows how to have a good time and SO WHAT?All these stuffy, intellectuals need to get a life. This CD is fun to listen to not to live your life by. Thirty years ago, Grace Slick and Janis Joplin were singing about drugs, sex etc. Tammy, Dolly and Loretta have all sung about booze, cheating, sex and the REAL life of American women. Gretchen just has a little more guts than most. If ya don't like it don't buy it. Those of us who aren't so uptight are going to go out and buy that CD and enjoy it!! I've read other reviews by the same people who berate this CD and it's always the same pompous a**holes that just love to hear themselves talk. Ignore the negative reviews by the same crowd of people who think too highly of themselves."
5,Here for your party!,"I suppose this is excellent party music,even Karaoke ones. I was at a New Year's Eve party at my local pub and one girl did a great job of singing the title track. REDNECK WOMAN kicks rear also. The other songs are good."
2,Not worth the money,"Right out of the box I put in fresh batteries and tried out the scale. Within 15 minutes I stepped on the scale 4 times and received 4 different measurements with a 3lb difference in all. It didn't really make a difference where you stood, stepping in the same place produced varied results.Also annoying was the fact that you had to almost balance yourself on the scale. It does a strange wobbly thing which I don't understand and was quite uncomfortable with.Easy to read display, but unfortunatly this is going back."
3,Fun and Traditional,"Nothing too shining or unique to this band's sound, but an enjoyable album none-the-less. It fits very nicely into the Paddy Punk genre, often a bit more traditional than one should expect."
3,Where was the editing??,"I am by no means a grammar snob, I have read books before that were not perfectly edited and still enjoyed them. Linda Dominique Grossvenor's 'THE HAMPTONS', however, was so poorly edited it was hard to go more than a page and a half with out noticing some pretty noticeable mistakes. The story was not bad, not at all what I expected, but still not bad, hence the three star rating, but not even the half way decent story could save this book.Linda Dominique Grossvenor obviously has some story telling talent, this short story of a woman who finds herself starting over after a painful divorce, heads out to The Hampton's only to meet a mystery man who is not at all what he seems, definitely had me wanting to see where the story would end. Going forward though, either she or her publishing company needs to go over her next book with a fine tooth comb because this one just did not hit the mark."
1,Waste of 3 hours,"This was an awful book, I can't believe it was published, let alone that it qualified as a ""novel"" - it took me all of three hours to read, was utterly predictable and definitely not spicy enough to qualify as a juicy summer read. In addition, there were multiple typos and editing errors. Pass..."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read!,"My friends and I decided to read this book for our book club... the cover looked interesting, the description sounded promising, and the reviews we read were glowing. We were completely and utterly disappointed with this book! It took over 2/3 of the book for the author to develop the characters and then in the last 40 pages or so, everything was rushed. The book was never proofread, they didn't even use spell check! All in all, it was an annoying read! Save your money!"
4,She Does It Again,"She does it again-Mariah Carey is in full flight with her latest single, ""Through the Rain"". Her vocal delivery is both insistent and understated, and brings out her powerhouse pipes just when you want them there. ""Rain"" is a song for Mariah fans of all ages, with a message of finding the strength within that has a universal appeal."
2,fairly typical Mariah Song,you heard it once you heard a million times before.Mariah Carey drops a Song too do away with Her Step into R&B/Rap/Hip-Hop Territory with Her first Single here.a departure from her usual First Single being Up-tempo.it's been years since Mariah went too the Power Ballad as the lead off Song&like Most of them they haven't been missed.of course She has Made some Great Slow Songs over the years but this isn't one of them.I did enjoy the Video&it's story-line.
2,Return to Doom,"Mariah's vocal powress has once and again been proven to be tops here, but the single isnt gonna help her much. It's another typically pedestrain Mariah ballad. The lyrics are also pretty mundane, talking about how she could ride through the rain and emerge victorious blah blah blah.....Mariah's high and lows accompany the song while the music plays on without much panache. The remixes are probably ok, just some dance beats to drown the original sentimental track with Mariah's vocals taking a backseat.With TTR and Charmbracelet, Mariah has not realized that her formulae for power ballads and hip-hop funk have worn thin with the influx of younger wannabes like Christina Aguilera."
4,Best o' Frankenstein,"Hands down, this is the *best* material I've heard from Electric Frankenstein, esp. the intro track (BOY does it rock!). The Hookers material is pretty weak, but this disc is well worth the price if only for the Frank."
2,Could have been very good,"I started out the new year with this book and made it through half of February. The devotionals are very good, but it would have been so much better if the Scripture was just printed without Meyer's additonal words to 'help' us understand the verses. The extra words became so annoying that I couldn't continue with the book."
4,short and sweet!,love that these are short enough to read even when you're in a rush in the morning. They get right to the point and really get you off to a good morning!
3,devotional,I was really disappointed with this book. the binder on the inside was broke so now all the pages fall out when I turn the page. But I still read it
3,Start your day,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
5,GREAT DEVOTIONAL BOOK,"I had previously read this book and it is one of the best devotional books I've found. It is very practical and is written by a top notch teacher, Joyce Meyer."
5,everyone can make time for this book,this book is great. it's clear and concise and really does get you off to a good start. the topics are relevant and it's a good way to start your day with the right frame of mind.
5,SO JOYFUL,"I absolutely love these books. I would suggest getting Ending Your Day right Devotions by Joyce Meyer. I brought these during a deployment to Afghanistan once and gave them to my sister when I returned home. Now I am back for my 2nd tour and purchased them again. They really helped me deal with life, letting go of the past and Joyce's words are God's words and are so refreshing:) and cleansing to the soul!!"
5,Love it,A great devotional book to use in your daily journey walk for Christ. Love Joyce Meyer devotional teachings. Great book.
3,I like it,"I love it. Its succinct and contains powerful messages. the brevity of these messages is particularly useful when you want to read a quick bible passage/ hear the word of God before dashing to class or work. However, for further and deep study of the Bible, Ill advice you get a Study devotional. I also love its portable size!!!"
5,Delightful Theater Book,"Full of telling details, this book is a gem about the theatrical milieu and its offbeat denizens. Huge amounts of warm, erudite fun for theatergoers of all kinds. And a perfect present for the theater aficianado you love! Simonson's book is highly recommended--a genuine treat."
5,Oral-B Ortho Rplc Review,"This product is what my son's orthodontist recommended for him to use for his braces. So far he likes it and has no complaints on it. I had a difficult time finding this item in the stores, so we had to order online; find out it was cheaper and less time consuming just to buy it online."
1,Balthus: A Biography,"This was the largest waste of paper I have read in quite a long time. The author is long winded and tiresome. I gave up sifting through all the garbage to find anything relevant to Balthus and his painting. Some of the color reproductions are good, but then buy the Claude Roy book."
3,Colored by personal dislike,"Weber clearly despises Balthus, finding him to be a self-denying Jew (that seems to be Balthus' original sin), a control freak, manipulative, despotic, self-aggrandizing, and virtually a pathological liar to boot. Weber thinks some of this can be understood with the help of amateur psychoanalysis, which at various points he is only too happy to provide.The book contains a lot of information about Balthus's life and his art, but assertions and interpretations that otherwise might seem to be true, fair, and insightful -- and may, in fact, be all of those things -- are tainted by the ever-present noise of an axe being ground backstage. The book made me want to see a second opinion from somebody who actually found something, anything, to like about Balthus as a person."
4,The Complete Book of Animals,It is perfect for research for an elementary class. Each animal has a write up about it and concludes with comprehension questions. My class loves doing research!
5,Better than expected,"I thought this book was only for young children (I got it for my 6 yr old son), but my 9 yr. old daughter loves it too! They both really enjoy reading about all the different kinds of animals and they love trying to draw/copy the pictures from the book. Overall, I think this book was an excellent purchase and would recommend it to others."
4,Fun remembering along with her!,"I bought this book to gain information and recipes for lefse, but ended up with a wonderful book with stories and memories that I could laugh, cry and remember with. Though I was a ""city kid"", I spent a lot of time on my uncle's farm, and grew up with my dad's stories of growing up on a farm, so I could relate to Leann's stories. It was very fun to reminisce along with her. By the way, the lefse turned out fabulous!! It's now the only recipe I use."
5,A Delightful Trip into the Past,"This book was truly delightful. I am a Canadian and was raised in a small rural town. Leann's stories reminded me so much of my own childhood in spite of the obvious differences, I really couldn't put the book down! Well done! I will certainly look forward to reading some more of her writings."
1,horribly boring,"this book was so terribly boring that it made me come close to tears when knowing that i had to read this book for a project. There are no clif notes, spark notes, etc. for this book and there should be. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS BOOK! it has no twist, and i can't even imagine how there could be one, considering that it was the same boring historical detail over and over and over again. if you must read this book, i recommend some strong coffee and some valium."
3,Could have used more explanation but still very useful,Broken Spears does something very interesting in his book that no one else has ever tried to do. He approaches the invasion of Mexico from the perspective of the Aztecs. He looks at the court of Montezuma and tells us how the invasion looked from their perspective. This is a very astute look at the invasion and one of the most unique out there. It is very well written and holds the readers interest. The biggest downfall of the book is that if you are not familiar with the story you will find it lacking in information. It assumes a great deal of information about the invasion that can be gotten from other books. It also takes into account the rise and fall of Montezuma and how the kingdom was not as unified as it appeared. If you are going to study Latin American history than this is a must read.
1,Ouch!,"Wow, this book reiterates everything it says as a way to make it look like it has a lot of content but that is not the case! Its basically a story which could have been told over 12 pages but they pad the h*ll out of it! I was interested in learning more Native American history but this book didn't give me anything new. Steer clear."
1,Don't waste your time and money!!!,"I purchased this trying to help a friend of mine who unexpectedly lost her husband who did not have a will. They list this as a ""brief article"" but I would not even consider it an article. Not worth a penny!!"
5,Love It,"Love it, this is perfect for what i needed, not to big and not to small. the belt is also really high quality. is very adjustable and holds the pouch up with both pockets full with slugs."
3,disney's the little mermaid : ariel's underseas adventure,"Cute game for age 5-6 but the problem is there is ALOT of reading, which means you sit with your child and do all the reading. We played for about 2 hours on it, and it's cute blowing bubbles, finding treasures and singing.. I really don't like the singing it's hard to get the notes and you have to, to move on. You put the face to the mic and stare at the screen to see if you got the correct note and after 3 or 4 times your getting a headache from being cross eyed looking to see if you got the right note. If your child just LOVES ariel, it's cute, but find it used so you don't spend alot of money on it, you'll be sitting with her for awhile until she memorizes the different things you do."
2,WAY TOO MUCH READING,"MY 6 YEAR OLD CAN'T PLAY UNLESS I SIT THERE THE WHOLE TIME READING, AND IT IS STILL NOT THAT MUCH FUN...THIS WAS HER FIRST DS GAME.BOTH OF US DISAPPOINTED. HOPE WE CAN FIND A BETTER ONE..ANY RECOMMENDATIONS?"
2,Just not right for the age who should LOVE it!!,"My 4 year old has been an Ariel fan for years. When she got into DS games, I thought this would be a logical choice. Problem is, there is SO much reading necessary that there is no way for her play it without me helping her. She liked ""trying"" to play, but she never really knew what she was doing. You need to be a good reader to play the game, problem is, by the time you can read that well, you are starting to outgrow it!"
3,Not bad not good,"I bought this thinking that it was going to remind me of the NES original Little Mermaid game. Well... It's not. It is REALLY suited for little girls, not big girls. I don't think it's a bad game. If I were 8 I would love this game. You sing in it to unlock stuff which is cool, but it's also a very slow paced game, made for young kids just getting into video games. If you are a little girl that loves the Little Mermaid, than... GO FOR IT! For little girls... Not big girls. Not like the original NES The Little Mermaid game. I hope this review was helpful."
3,fun,My kids are 8 and 6 and they both seem to like this game. THey dont play it as much as some of the other DS games they have but they have told me they like it.
2,Didn't meet expectations.,"Not worth the $. It's cute, my daughter love princesses, but the reading - it's just too much - no matter how old you are. Even tried to shorten it for my daughter, but I got tired of reading it myself. So it's turned to just a treasure hunt.The other aspect I do not like at all is that you have to ""sing"" to open the chests - so can't play it quietly. It's not as easy to get the right notes either. There is no way to bypass that, or any other option to open the chests. So stuck trying to 'sing' their notes, very annoying.The plus side, My daughter really enjoys cleaning and polishing the treasures that are dug up. Also, when you go into her little cave, and put the treasures in the big 'magic' ball it shows fast mini clips of the movie. Each item gives you a different piece of the movie, and it's a few minutes of enjoyment there.Too bad they are very short, and more reading is envolved in that.It's not a game that will last very long, and am disappointed with it."
5,Ariel's Undersea Adventure,This was a hard to find DS game and will be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. She will be extremely happy as she is one of Ariel's biggest fans. Grandma Kathy
3,Not what I expected,I gave it three stars because when I got the game it is in spanish. When I went back and read the description and the back of my game it said it was in English. My daughter can still play it and I opted to keep it to avoid the hassle of sending it back. Be careful buying this product.
2,I'll purchase it for my five year old.,I bought this game for my 5 year old she did not like it. I tried playing it myself to see why. It is because you have to read too much and it is boring.
4,My 11 year old loves this game,I even played it all the way through and it was fun. There are alot of different tasks to complete including singing and blowing sand off of objects. It is very cute and entertaining.
4,"Good franchise, but game is lacking when compared to rivals","My 3 year old daughter asked me to buy her this game for Christmas. She's a huge fan of the DS and can play Super Princess Peach, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Kirby like a pro. So, I bought the game for her. Now, the Little Mermaid is a good franchise in general, and has a very wholesome, family appeal, so I would never think twice about buying a Disney product like that. However, compared to games made by Japanese developers, the play control was not intuitive enough for my 3 year old daughter to enjoy it. She quickly lost interest. And yes, she still plays Princess Peach, Sonic, and Kirby all the time."
1,Steer clear!,"To add my two cents in with some of other reviewers of this toothbrush...This sonic toothbrush is a piece of .... After a month of use, the brush turns on the minute you take it off of the charger..it finally shuts itself off after about a minute and a half..then you can't turn it on again. Get a life, get a new sonic toothbrush that works!"
2,Falls apart after a short time!!!,"I got this for Xmas from my sis since she's studying to be a dental hygenist, but the problem is this toothbrush has not been working right at all. For one, the first one I got from my sis was fully charged but after using it once would not work unless I squeezed the handle really hard. Then I had it exchanged for a different one but over a month of using it the toothbrush itself would automatically turn itself on when I take it out of the charger. I could not turn it off either since the buttons are so hard to press and you'd practically need tough fingers to work this thing after some time. I'd recommend a toothbrush that's a little more expensive with more reliability than this one."
1,SoniCrap,"I ordered two of these toothbrushes. One was defective right out of the box. I sent it back and got a replacement that worked for about a week. After recharging the unit, it wouldn't turn ""on"" anymore. Besides quality issues, the buttons on the toothbrush are poorly designed. They are extremely difficult to press."
1,Effortless Brushing,The Product was designed to bring effortless and effective brushing for all. Clean and healthy teeth awaits u.
1,be very careful if you wanna buy,It's only good for one week. Now I can't press the button to switch it to higher speeds. Don't know if I could return it or I have to pay $5 to replace.
2,Not the best guide for getting around or finding places.,"I purchased the guide because it seemed to give more background information than others I've seen such as Frommers. However, when we tried to use the maps to find our way around, we realized they were not well thought out, and were more confusing than helpful! Also, the restaurant section could be better organized, and give information such as price and address. We were frustrated over and over again with this guide."
2,Even More Hardcore?,"While the first volume in this series at least had the infamous ""Right Side of My Brain"" with its adults-only Lydia Lunch moments, this second volume shows how much of a one-trick-pony act both Lunch and director Richard Kern are in the field of performance art/video. This would have been a much better value for fans by putting all the short videos and filler onto one tape, but, that's commerce."
2,Very poorly written,"I found Arditti's writing to be simply attrocious. What the marketplace needs is a clear, concise guide to instrument structure and valuation, and Mr. Arditti writes in circles. As an example, his chapter on option pricing refers to ""using the methods used previously in this chapter"" without referring to how to apply these to the method just introduced. The method just introduced was explained using numbers that were presumably fabricated, but lord only knows, because the author can't be bothered to specify how his example was structured.In trying to explain things simply, the author fails to explain anything clearly. ""Derivatives"" is an extreme disappointment. As a reference, this book may have some use, but if you're looking to learn something from it, stear clear."
5,....,"If you've worked up a sweat listening to the rampaging rhythems of RASA:EXOTICA, then it's time to pick up its sister compilation, RASA:MELLO, and chill to some seriously smooth grooves. Fourteen tracks, blended one into the next, take the listner on a cross-cultural journey like none other. It all begins with the Brazilian lounge sounds of ""Foto Viva"" from Mo'Horizions and a little taste of Latin sensuality from Rinocerose. From there, sit back and enjoy the ride as you're treated to delectable diversions from the stunning chanteuse Natacha Atlas, the dub delicacies of Groove Armada, Celtic-pop crooning from emer Kenny and much more."
3,Rasa Review,I purchased this CD after hearing 3 songs on a Pandora music station. The 3 that I was familiar with are probably the best songs on this CD. It is okay.
1,Not good enough...,"Most people should pass on this device.It is probably about 1 or 2 years behind the current portable a/v technology; the screen quality is barely adequate for video or picture playback; the interface is awkward to use; the battery life is short (maybe 45 minutes for video playback and picture viewing); and finally, it is difficult to encode video clips for this device.Cool concept, small form factor, nice design, but it does not work very well."
4,Usefullish,"This card fits into several of the Franklin range I believe , but I used mine in the MWD-1450.(Since they seem to change the numbers for different markets ,this might not be much help not you.)The contents of the card were very useful and I used it a lot in France when travelling. Particularly useful is the fact that you can search ALL the conjugated forms and get back to the root verb. There are also a variety of idiomatic phrases which appear with the key words. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any other way to search for these so it is a bit of a lucky dip. You can store these and favourite words in the memory , however this vanishes when you change the battery. There may be a way to avoid this (perhaps changing the battery in under 0.5 seconds!)but I have not found it.Overall I found the contents excellent but was less impressed with the device that the card runs in. Useful nevertheless."
3,The BQF-2025 is a non-speaking Bookman card.,"As the review from Yeny Bennett noted the BQF-2025 is a non-speaking Bookman card. S. Owens asks is it for sale or not. The answer is sometimes Yes and sometimes No. This is a rather old (but still usable) card that is no longer being manufactured. The newer BFQ-3033 card is more generally available. So, sometimes this item will be in stock and sometimes not. The BFQ-3033 has many times more words in it that this card. It is also a non-speaking card, but is a Bookman II card. There are 1 or 2 rather old Franklin ""main units"" that cannot take the newer Bookman II cards."
1,I want a replacement pair!!,Although they are nice the stitching has already come out after just one use and wash. Not acceptable and I want someone to contact me to replace these.
5,Our Home by the Sea,"My daughter attends Hampton (class of '11) so I really have an affinity for the school and the area surrounding it. The book is not just a cook book, but a trip through the history of Hampton University by way of words and photos. Included are recipes from the Hampton Cross Roads area. This may be the only weakness of the book: that the recipes are not from those who attended or taught at Hampton (as was the case with the Tuskeegee Institute cookbook Ms. Tillery eidted) but rather they are from the greater Hampton Cross Roads area, which Ms. Tillery explains. The book inspires great nostalgia and great respect for Hampton. The recipes loook delicious. Taste of Freedom was well worth the purchase!"
1,"The ""downloadable"" version lacks the STEREO of the original, excellent, ""audio-CD"" version!","Folks, why would you settle for a ""corrupted"" or ""watered down"" version of a great, highly effective recording? Alas, the ""downloadable"" versions of Glenn Harrold's recordings don't include the original STEREO (conspicuous left/center/right-directional) vocal sound effects that he so expertly implements in his audio-CD versions. Believe me (especially if you wisely use headphones as Mr. Harrold--at the outset--urges you to do), if you truly want to FULLY benefit from this hypnosis recording, it's well worth the substantial extra cost for the ""audio-CD"" (instead of the ""downloadable"") version.Fortunately, Amazon.com does carry the proper ""audio-CD"" version; be sure to order IT instead (click the following link):Heal Your Body"
5,This book is amazing,"I have had the pleasure of meeting this very talented poet. She is an amazing writer, so full of details and life. These poems really have a lot of truth and feeling in them. This is one great book that you will always remember."
5,Five-Stars for Nostalgia!,I am a twelve year-old girl who is classically trained in piano and the minute I heard the first song on this CD I knew I loved it. The variety of music combined with the interesting histories and dedications behind them help make Nostalgia a wonderful CD. Meral Guneyman's passion for music is very inspiring and uplifting. She is a very talented and dedicated pianist and I hope to hear more from her soon!
3,Fogging,"Goggles fit well and keep the water out of your eyes, but mine fogged up badly and made it difficult to see out of them."
3,"ok, but fit not reliable enough for me","They are very clear to look through which is a high priority for me. when i can get these to sit in the right spot, I can get over 1hr of fog and leak free swimming. only problem is that only happens about 1/3 of the time. Other times I get very slow leaking. I like them, but can't spend the first 5 mins of each swim trying to get them sitting just right. for the price, they are worth a try."
2,Very uncomfortable!,"I did not know much about these goggles at the point of purchase - I now know that 2.0 means they are on the small side (it would have been helpful to have had an indication of size in the product description). My 6yo daughter also finds them uncomfortable so I don't know if it is 100% a size issue. They are designed to sit in your sockets, rather than around your brow/cheekbones. I just can't get them to fit comfortably - either too loose and let in water or too tight and very painful/obscuring vision."
3,"Awesome goggles, lousy strap","I've been using Socket Rockets for the last 8 years. I bought a new pair this past summer to replace my very scratched, on-the-20th-strap-taken-from-lost-and-found-goggles pair that I loved. The goggles worked great, but the strap literally started dissolving after 3 months. It would leave a black strap mark around my head after I got done swimming and would stick to everything in my bag. I remedied the situation with a new bungie strap that I bought, but it was annoying to watch the strap dissolve over the course of a month.So, love for the goggle but buy yourself a bungie strap."
3,not good for occasional swimmer,"I found that these goggles would leak unless I snugged them up painfully tight. They also fogged up fairly quickly. These might be good for competition, but I don't like them for normal use."
4,A Look at the Anthropology of Violence,"The ""Anthropology of Violence"" is a fine collection of case studies, as interoduced by the book's editors. The introduction is worth the price alone, but the case studies add an incredible amount of information in just 229 pages. My only complaint (and a significant one, I think) is that the entire book deals with war rather than all forms of human violence. This is a severe drawback to an otherwise important anthropological work."
2,I persisted to the bitter end!,"I found the premises of most of the stories intriguing. The stories were very well written. I particularly liked ""Hawksbill Station."" However, I found that most of the stories, including the latter, had unsatisfying endings. This collection did not live up to its title...."
2,The best? Please!,"You cannot have a ""Best Time Travel"" collection without Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder."" Even other time travel stories quote his. Ridiculous title for this book!"
2,"good ideas, poor execution","I've only read the first four stories in this collection. But I have been extremely disappointed. The authors explored diverse and interesting takes on the concept of time travel. But their narration was sloppy and amateurish. Considering that these authors are some of the biggest names in Sci Fi (Nancy Kress, Damon Knight, Poul Anderson), this is beyond disappointing."
4,"A Literate ""page turner""","A very good book, but not a great book and I guess I was hoping for great. The story of a dying woman in Scotland who decides to journey home to the village in Iceland where she grew up. In the process she faces many demons from her past. My main problem was that the character wasn't entirely likable, which I suppose made her more human, but I was thinking that with all she had been through she would have been more humane. I certainly couldn't stop reading until all the details from Disa's life had been revealed."
1,"Familiar, no?","If you enjoy the prose of this book, you will no doubt enjoy the literary craftings of MFK Fisher as well. It is no cooincidence; passages from this text are lifted directly from the late Ms. Fisher's works, with no more than a name here or there altered to make it seem ""original."" Read the true original instead."
3,Cute Visual Aids,"The glider guy and the building were complicated enough that my lego savvy eleven year old couldn't manage them without adult help, but we did find the kit enjoyable overall."
5,one of my favorites!,"classic oiled bronze lamp, very handsome, with a traditional look that ges well with many decors. the workmanship is very nice. well-made, sturdy and practical as well as good looking."
5,Making nursery rhymes relevant in my 21st-century classroom,"As a music teacher in a city school, I have used this book to introduce children to nursery rhymes and to give those who already know them a new understanding. The photo illustrations are beautiful and depict the text using modern city-scape images. My students can interpret the meaning of these treasured old rhymes by looking at illustrations of kids who look just like they do. The book features photographs of children with different skin and hair colors, styles of dress, and kids of various ages."
2,I don't really like it.,I don't really like it. maybe I don't know how to let the kids get the idea about the mother goose stories.
4,Mother Goose Review,The Neighborhood Mother Goose stories are nicely aligned with modern day pictures to give it appeal to the newer generations.
3,An OKay Mindless Read,Slim and None is very easy to read. The chapters are short. There are not many characters so it's easy to follow. The plot is simple -- a golfer at the end of his career is trying to win a major championship. The reader is taken through the twists and turns as each major unfolds. I found myself laughing out loud several times. If you want a book to read at the beach or in the bathroom -- this is your book. Nothing comprehensive about Slim and None. I must say -- the ending stinks!!!! I really thought Dan Jenkins could have put more time into it as the book abruptly ends. I might give Dead Solid Perfect a try because I've gotta believe Mr. Jenkins has more to offer than this. His columns in Golf Digest are priceless. Save your money or buy a used copy -- it's not worth $20.
2,I just don't get it.,This book just doesn't give you what you expect from Dan Jenkins. I'm on page 76 and don't know if I want to finish it or not. Jenkins can't even keep straight who is on the leaderboard and who the playing partners would be in a final round per that leaderboard. He's a great golf writer but I just don't get the appeal of this fiction try of his.
4,20 year wait,"Was a big fan of this album when it was released in 1980 and have been trying to get a copy of the CD for 20 years.This re-released version has 7 of the original 9 songs from the US version of Angel City Darkroom. Unfortunately one of the missing songs is ""Ivory Stairs"" with the other song being ""Straightjacket"".The other 11 tracks are for the most part forgettable. Still I would recommend it to anyone that was a fan of the original album."
5,darkroom/ angel city,"great cd don't remember who i bought it from though,i think it was import cds. great service!always fast mailing it unlike other sellers, i ordered some cds a couple of weeks ago from someone else and import cds at the same time,i've listened to the cds already and i'm still waiting on the other ones. it baffles me that these company's ship from the other side of nation and i get there's before i get the ones that come from somewhere alot closer to me! i even received stuff from across the border and got faster and thats even going thru customs."
5,Nice,"These etymological riffs by a physician-scholar on his day off are a delight. For a taster you might try his couple of pages on the root 'mer' (Ch 4), though the deviation into morality at the end feels a bit like padding. During these forays into linguistic 'deep history' we are vouchsafed the origin of gentle - twice, even ('one of our best words', pronounces Thomas with feeling) - but not the later variants genteel, gentile and gentleman, or indeed gentry (the ubiquitous gentil[le] in French means, simply, nice). I see I forgot genital; Thomas doesn't - not to mention genius, and generous, and kin (the root is 'gen') from which we get back by another way to the French gentillesse - kindness! You will have fun"
1,defective,"i bought 2 pairs of these. both were defective, and were purchased a year apart from one another. customer service was a major disappointment. they are from a company that is local to me, and when i offered to drive to their location to work out my exchange that they promised, yet never delivered on, they told me they could not help me at a store since amazon works with their catalog department, which by the way is also local to me yet not available to help me. thumbs WAY down :- ("
2,"Buyer Beware -- Set Looks Lovely, But Doesn't Hold Up!","This tea set looks adorable, but ""buyer beware!"" I gave this tea set to my granddaughter for Christmas. I loved it, her mother loved it and my granddaughter loved it -- UNTIL my granddaughter put water in one of the cups and let it sit in the cup overnight. The inside of the cup was RUSTED by morning. My granddaughter brought it downstairs to her mother that morning. She was in tears because her beautiful new tea set was ""ruined!""Call me crazy, but if this set rusts when plain water is left to sit in it overnight, what would happen to it if tea or juice, or any liquid that is acid or base was left in it! Do not buy this product!"
5,Superb product,"This is a fantastic product. I'm very satisfied with it and highly recommend it.Pros:The clarity is awesome.Very high resolution (you can see specs on product page).No dead pixels.Very rich and vivid colors.Cons:Very minor - that the height is not adjustable, although the screen can be tilted."
3,Viewsonic VA1912wb,"I'm happy with the overall performance of the Monitor. One small irritant is that the connections on the back are buried beneath an access panel that is difficult to remove.My single experience with ViewSonic phone support was not good.The technician was abrupt. As a result of that encounter, I will never buy another ViewSonic product."
3,Great Monitor - not plug and play for me,"First off, this is a great monitor with nice speakers for a great price. HOWEVER - for our IBM laptop the required 1440 x 900 screen display set up was not included. If you have the display settings this monitor needs OR your are totally comfortable updating your display card drivers, this is a five star monitor. If you don't have the settings and don't feel comfortable updating the drivers - STAY AWAY!"
2,Had to give-up on installation; zippo tech support,"My graphics card (Nvidia 6800) did not accomodate the 1440x900 resolution. I spent hours trying to find and download the right drivers, but to no avail. Will have to return it, which is too bad since the monitor is sleek and beautiful and promises great clarity if I could fix the resolution. Very, very disappointing. And I'm really frustrated that there was no warning about this incompatability!!Also, the tech support guy who answered the phone at Viewsonic was completely worthless. He told me to go surf the Nvidia website and see if I could find a driver. I would at least have expected him to tell me if I my graphics card supported this monitor!!!"
3,Dead Pixel already,Just got mine couple months ago and I already have 4 dead white color pixels. Im returning mine and get a new one.
3,Larry R,"Screen quality was OK. However, it is a very limited product. For example, it does not rotate, does not support two documents on the screen at the same time. It is primarily good if you want to watch movies - which is not something I want to do."
4,It's true - the blue popup IS annoying,"Was wary of purchasing this product due to most of the reviews I read mentioning an ""annoying blue popup"" (about 3"" x 5"") in the middle of your screen that says ""analog"" upon resolution change. Well, it's true, the popup IS annoying. I have found no way to defeat it or move it out of the middle of the screen and customer service at ViewSonic confirmed that there is no way. There IS an option to turn the background for the menus off in the setup menu: however, it doesn't actually turn it off, but makes the blue background semi-transparent and only slightly less annoying. But don't get me wrong - this is a great little monitor for the price. It would get 5 stars for sure if ViewSonic could find a less obtrusive way to alert you that you are going to analog (presuming of course that you really care to know every darned time it happens)."
4,Great price - limited performance,"LCD quality is very good and the foot print small enough to keep your desk uncluttered. Sound from the speakers is remarkably poor and cannot be improved except by adding clutter. No USB port, no earphone plug."
4,I might name one of my kids VA1912wb,I bought this monitor a few years back. I haven't had the least bit of trouble with it. The picture has always been very nice in terms of clarity and color. I definitely consider ViewSonic products in my next monitor purchase. Check out the new PC mini VOT550 that ViewSonic has designed
4,Great price!,Love it! Only problem is that the electrical plug sometimes doesn't work and I cant get the back on
5,ViewSonic Monitor,Purchased this monitor a couple of months ago and have had no problems with it. We really like it.
5,A Great Monitor!,"The picture is very nice, no problems. Though not its' intended primary use, what this monitor adds to viewing DVDs is amazing. Through the combination of proximity to the monitor and the wide screen, one's field-of-view is surprisingly filled. All games are positively enhanced through the wide screen. Some websites do not expand to fit the whole screen and others do, but this is the websites issue. Color accuracy is high. Clarity and fine print excellent. The response time is better than many on the market at higher prices and smaller screens. And Viewsonic is a well-known brand. Much more comforting than buying an off-brand and hoping the low cost does not equal low picture quality.I recommend this monitor. Especially if you use it as a multi-media center."
2,"If you don't have graphics card that supports wide screen, do not purchase","I'm sure that this is a great monitor but unless your computer is set-up for wide screen to support the 1440 x 900 format, look elsewhere. I wish that I had read the previous review, dated 9/6 before ordering this monitorCOMMENT: In editing this review, let me say that I was impressed with the initial quality of this 1st Viewsonic Wide Screen Product product which is why I ordered another Viewsonic 19"" monitor that matches the 1280 x 1024 resolution of my laptop."
2,not for regular work,i think this monitor is too bright and even adjusting controls doesnt improve it. I wouldn't recommend this one for reading text. But to see pictures it is not too bad.
4,LCD monitor,Good buy for the money.Looks good and clear.. good resolution-a bit confusion in setting up but turned it upside down (carefully) and saw the connections.. which are not viewable from above the back.This is my second viewsonic monitor (CRT was first) and a very satisfactory buy for the money.
4,A Work of Art,"It is my third year now, owning the Llewellyn Witches' Calendar. The new one is underneath the old, it was hard not to peek at the new one before it is time. They call it the ""Wiccan Wheel of the Year."" Not your average ""calendar at a glance,"" this calendar is beautiful and filled with hours of wiccan lore. You'll find warm and gorgeous glossy artwork, and hundreds of tips and hints to get you spiritually inspired to learn more. {We all need that, and references are included in the back.) Learn the origins of 12 days of Christmas, Easter Eggs, and Halloween. When the year is done, you're not done with the calendar!Each year features different customs and festivals, and several articles follow at the back of the calendar. This year learn about the witches' law, book of dreams, and is Harry Potter really magic? Llewellyn's Witches' Calendar is something you'll want to make a yearly tradition."
5,Cant wait for the new year to start,"Plenty of information..moon phases, color corespondences, and lots of room to write those all important dates..."
5,Wonderful smooth jazz..........,"Some of the best Smooth Jazz artists are on this CD. Not only is it great music, but the proceeds go to WNUA Cares for Kids Charities. How could you go wrong?"
5,Awesome Author and Book!,"James P Lewis and his books are great for any project manager practitioner. It has a wealth of information and I have every one of his books. I studied from oen of his first books and passed the PMP exam as well as use his books to teach project management classes at a couple of universities. It is easy read, full of ideas and reference information for everyday use."
2,Not Worth the Investment,The book is too vague on the topics with too many general concepts and rules. There should be more concrete examples to illustrate how the concepts that the author is promoting worked in real life. Reminds me of Rich Dad/Poor Dad.
1,"Save your money, time and frustration...DON'T BUY THIS!!!","Forget the 1500 lbs they say it will carry.The one and only welded stud on the entire wagon snapped off in the first couple of days and the heaviest thing that had been in it was our 42lb grandson.The stud held and controlled the steering mechanism;a very poor design/flaw that ruins the entire wagon.After 2 trys with Griz's cust.svc. and 20 days of waiting for parts that were wrong(I even had 2fax them the parts list so they could see what I was talking about....hello!)The entire front undercarriage is welded together by the maker,but Griz sent parts that were wrong(they insisted that the part was what we needed.AND we would have had2somehow weld it ourselves.They have our $$ and we have scrap metal.Oh,it's a pretty blue!"
2,Diappointed,"I was very disappointed with the condition of the cart when it arrived. The box was busted, pieces were missing, and Grizzly will take weeks to get me the replacement parts. They also don't tell you before you order that the delivery freight truck won't deliver the 95 pound box unless a human is there."
1,Save Your Money !!!,"We also have this wagon, and we have the same problem. We only use the thing to haul hay to our 4 horses, Maybe 20 pounds at the most, and the front front end broke on ours the same as the other reviews said. We agree it is a pretty blue....We are gonna try to contact the company, but no matter what they send us, it will require us welding it on ourselves..."
1,Looks good BUT,The welded front wheel connection broke almost immediately with no more stress than 100 lbs of compost and soil
3,So-so story with some fairly erotic moments!,"I would have enjoyed this film so much more if there was less Stephen Baldwin in it and more Ally Sheedy, Patsy Kensit, and Mimi Langeland. Not that I particularly hate Stephen Baldwin, but I really loved seeing the erotic chemistry between Sheedy and Kensit. Sadly, most of their hottest moments together apparently ended up on the cutting room floor. And that meant this one was less of an erotic thriller and more of a what-the-heck-is-going-on-thriller."
2,Not What I Expected,"I expected this movie to be something like the Dead Calm. It was not. See the Dead Calm. That's a must see, suspensful movie. This movie was not and also slow moving. I'm not saying not to watch it. It is interesting, and thank goodness it is a short movie."
2,Ironic Semi-endorsement,"For such a sturdy, heavy-duty, ridiculously strong u-lock, the key used to operate this thing is ridiculously flimsy.The key snapped off IN THE LOCK the first time I tried to unlock my bike from a rack. >=(Five minutes with a hacksaw only managed to scratch the steel. Seeing that I had to call in the heavy artillery, I got an angle grinder with a diamond blade. After about 20 minutes of 120 dBA flying sparks, I successfully extricated the bike.I give the lock 5 stars, but the key rates a big, fat 0."
3,"Good lock, mount won't work on my bike","Bought it when I moved to Isla Vista, a town notorious for bike theft. I haven't had my bike stolen but the mount won't work on my bike. It's not the mount's fault though, just the way my bike was built I guess. I also find it difficult to unlock in some positions, I have to practically lie on the ground to figure out which way to put the key in. The key's are nice and I like the lighted one, I don't think i'll get much use out of it though as I don't ride my bike at night."
1,"Lock is solid, key is TERRIBLE","I bought this lock, took it out of the box, unlocked it once, locked it over the handlebars of my bike, and took the bike out for a ride. When I got to my destination, the key would not unlock the lock; instead, the key bent out of shape. The exact same thing happened with BOTH of the other keys that came with this lock. I am returning this lock now; I will probably have to remove my handlebars to get it off of my bike. I've never had any trouble with any other Kryptonite locks, but this model has serious issues."
2,dont trust it to open,do not trust this lock to open after it is locked--it can be a struggle and i feel that one day it will not open--this is a replacement for one that totaly rusted up lock--service was great--once again i really do not consider this lock reliable--over 60 years of cycling
1,Why you should be paid to buy this lock ...,"Simply put, the key is made out of the weakest expletive. This lock opened up once. I broke the dang thing trying to open it after it had been on the shelf for a couple months, never used, nor weathered. All I can say is the key sucks, the locking mechanism locks, and dont be suprised if this happens to you. & if it does, dont be suprised if their customer support never replies to your emails. Kryptonite == FAILS. Do not buy this lock, look for another manufacturer as I will never buy from these blokes again. They ripped me off!"
3,"Good, Big Lock. Terrible Bracket Design","The lock is big and sturdy. The key seems to work fine in mine. The length enables the lock to attach to many different objects. The bracket and mount are absolutely horrible. One of the reasons that I purchased the lock was to have it attach to my bike. But the lock is nice enough that I will find some other way to carry this monsterous lock around. If you are torn between this and the mini, I would probably by the mini. This one will be a pain to lug around until I find another way to attach it to my bike."
3,"Good lock, bad bracket","Decide what you will about the strengths of this lock, but keep in mind that its mounting bracket is useless. I couldn't get the bracket to fully tighten, and then when I tried to remove it, I had to break the bracket to get it off my frame! I'm actually kind of glad that I destroyed the bracket, because its design for putting the lock in a out is also terrible, and would have resulted in bloodied knuckled and a dented frame every time I removed or placed the lock in its bracket. There are other mounting options out there, but I shouldn't have to spend $20 more on a proper bracket after dropping $45 on a lock.Aside from that, it's a good strong lock that's long enough to secure my bike to oddly shaped bike racks. And people breaking their keys off in the lock must be really fidgety - just gently work the key in and the lock will open fine. If you encounter any resistance, just wiggle to key and try to move it down into the lock further."
4,"Heavy duty lock, crappy bracket","The lock is fairly heavy, not cumbersome though. I just hang it from my handlebars when I ride around.The bracket is useless. I can't even get the lock in it.Overall, it looks to be a quality lock that I feel safe with."
3,Great lock but very heavy,"I have no doubt this u-lock works great, it certainly looks and feels secure. However it is very heavy. I had to buy this size because my bike's tires are somewhat thick (it's a beach cruiser type bike) so the mini would not fit around the tire and the frame. If a mini fits your bike you should go for that, if not get ready to lug this heavy lock around. Also, I would recommend that you get a cable as well if you are planning to leave your bike for a long time or overnight. Otherwise the lock is great."
1,Should be bundled with a lockpick,"Today marks the end of my contentious relationship with this product.I should've known from the start, when my new key would turn exactly halfway then no more in the new lock, that this ""improved"" Kryptonite would remove my peace of mind. Oh, to be sure, we had a couple years of relatively predictable locking-unlocking cycles (and I was mindful to be gentle with the cr*p pot-metal key as the product brochure recommends). But today we've had our last argument over whether the lock would let the key unlock it. This wretched, flawed bicycle lock is being sawed from my bike even as I write.DO NOT BUY THIS LOCK IF YOU EXPECT TO UNLOCK IT REGULARLY."
1,Key mechanism sucks,"I've been having some serious troubles inserting the key and getting the lock to open. Given the fact that this lock is one of the most secure ones, it's a joke how sensitive it's key mechanism is. Kryptonite did allow me to exchange the product and sent me new one which works."
4,solid lock,Very sturdy lock and the holder it came with to attach to your bike is crucial. A little frustrating when the key doesn't fit or turn but only takes a few seconds to align it correctly.
4,Heavy Lock,"This lock adds some heft to the bike, which you can really tell when you lift and carry the bike.The included bracket to attach the lock to the bike frame, itself has some size. Do to my bikes frame, Trek 3 Series, with water bottle, you are very limited in where you can attach the lock and not have it get in the way of your legs. I ended up attaching it to the seat post and moving the reflector, it is off to the one side but its out of the way.If you can try out the various sizes; MINI, STD, LG this will help you see what fits the bike and remember to include what you'll able to secure the bike to.One thing, I am hope does not become an issue it the plastic slot where the Lock (silver part) slides into. With the jarring it takes its seems that the lock already has more wiggle room than it started with. Will have to see after a few months and years if it holds up."
5,Rock Solid in Brooklyn for 2 years,"I've been using this lock for 2 years+ in every neighborhood in Brooklyn NYC and nobody has even bothered trying to steal my sweet trek 6500 so far - I use the it with the full pinheads set (wheels, stem, seatpost, etc). I hated the mount so it's strapped to the rack and you should definitely wd-40 the lock every once in a while but otherwise no key issues. It weighs a ton (helps make me faster on my road bike though) but if you don't want your bike stolen I'd wager it's worth it."
5,ROCK meets CULT,"This album is awesome, almost reminessent of some of the Doors style music, funny how he ended up as thier new singer."
3,not the cult's best,"well to start off, i bought this cd and i really didnt like it that much but i was able to pick out a couple listenable tracks like bad medicine waltz,spiritwalker,and go west . but for the rest of the cd i wouldnt really suggest anyone even bother unless you are a full-on cult fan,hey i thought i was until i heard this cd, sorry people but it's just not their best."
2,Disappointed,"I've seen the movie several times over the years on TV and had bought the VHS tape many years ago. Since I no longer have a VHS machine I thought I would get it on DVD to add to my collection of classic Christmas movies. My wife and I still enjoy the story, but were very disappointed with the quality of the picture/recording. It was like a copy of a copy. With todays technology I would think they would do a better job. I would NOT recommend puchasing this DVD due to the poor picture quality."
2,"I like the movie, but poor quality",I had to return the movie because of the poor quality. I think I was reimbursed but I don't remember.
5,Another Christmas movie for collection,My mother loves Christmas movies any time of the year. This video adds to her library that she can enjoy whenever she wants.
1,A Hobo's Christmas with Bonus CD: Christmas Magic,"I have not yet recieved my dvd. (A Hobo's Christmas.)I e-mailed them,3 times, about it and I had no responce.I was purchased it Dec 8th 2010. And I was surposeto get it Dec 30th.But I have not yet recieved it yet."
4,Captures the Times,"This soundtrack is a very good integration of director Eastwood's music with traditional patriotic music and music of the WWII era. Overall, this soundtrack captures the time and place and the lives affected by events. As a soundtrack album of the film, this CD works effectively."
3,Better as Background Music,"While this is an interesting mix, it works better as part of the film experience. To listen to the music, without the film accompanying, causes it to lose much of the impact. One thing film makers almost never get right is the spirit of the vocals in movies about the 1930s and 1940s. The female trio, in the war bond drive scenes, sounds like a contemporary imitation of the vocalists from that era. They don't sound authentic and I have heard many vocalists (solo or mixed voices) from the 1930s and 1940s on compact disc. This happens with orchestras attempting to recreate that era even when playing those arrangements. One orchestra that gets it absolutely right is the Dutch orchestra The Beau Hunks. So it can be done. Check them out on Amazon."
2,Maybe I'm being too harsh . . .,"[Review of original score not of the period pieces]Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and Band of Brothers contain some of the best, dramatic scoring for a war film. Flags of our Fathers does NOT join that rank. There is no memorable music from Eastwood's too simplistic score. It sounds nice on the trailer but on film, well, all you remember is the same melody played over and over then back and forth among the ensemble. The weak trumpet piece is nice but gets trying after the two hours of film. There's little score in the film and on the album hence the era filler music.The score does support some parts of the film but it falls short during the flag rising. That should have contained music that would make one's arm hair rise. Didn't happen. On album, the music is a tired listen. Three stars for effort. One star for boring original score. Sorry, Eastwood. Next time outsource your music to someone that specializes in that area of the filmmaking process."
2,completely off topic,if you have a kindle think twice befoe buying this book. most of the information is not even related to diabetes....however if you are looking for a book about pms or menopause or sex after menopause or the various blood pressure meds or...this was some fun stuff...why our nation is so obese and all the different types of fats and additives that have been around since the 1920s...this book is definately for you. it does not even have a table of contents so you can skip the off topic fluff. this cost me 10.00 dollars and i am going back to the kindle store and will buy the diabetes first year book. this is my first kindle review and i have had my kindle for almost a year and have bought well over 100 books on it.
3,Denim and Lace,"The back cover reads:""Two worlds...one desire. Once their families had been friends. But dark secrets and scandal swept them fiercely apart into separate worlds. By then it was too late for Bess. Her heart was corralled by a man she thought she couldn't have and she was trapped in a world where she didn't belong. Until that world shattered. And her heart was thrown from the wild bronco of love. Was Cade there to pick up the pieces out of love... revenge...or only the wild fury of his desire to have her? And even if he did love her, what kind of future could they fashion out of..."""
1,GREAT MOVIE!,"I've always enjoyed watching Susan Hayward act and this movie is one of my favorites - it is a real tearjerker, so I keep the kleenex handy!"
1,Back Street,"Again, this was an old movie I wanted on DVD. I ordered it twice and neither copy would play on my average/normal Panasonci DVD player ! Was very disappointed and that is why I want my money back."
2,Back Street VHS,"The video arrived in a timely manner, however, it is damaged. There are lines in the picture for the first 15 minutes. The lines return towards the end of the movie and needles to say it is distracting and annoying. I would suggest to the owner in the future to please make sure your videos are damage free.Thank you"
1,Back Street VHS--NOT-- Blank tape,This VHS tape is blank...Back StreetThumbs down on this seller. I am very dissatisfied. I have bought many used items through Amazon and always had very good results with other sellers. I wrote to the seller and did not get a response. I asked for details on returns and no response. I asked for a refund and no response. Do not purchase from this seller. I am still waiting for action to be taken to resolve this issue. I rate this BAD (no stars).I hope Amazon can help me with this problem.
2,BRIC-BRAC STREET,"This is iron-on melodrama with a great turn by Vera Miles as a vindicative priveliged wife. John Gavin could have been replaced by a fire hydrant, and delivered the same performance."
3,Only for the faint of heart...,"The modern audience for this film is probably pretty narrow -- hardcore fans of the romance genre and those who like to laugh at its conventions. This is a fairly dull tear-jerker romance, featuring Susan Hayward as a feisty fashion designer who falls for a married man (played by a geefy, Rock Hudson-esque John Gavin) who also just happens to be a millionaire businessman. It's OK, though: the husband is excused for having an affair because his wife is an alcoholic golddigger who won't let him out of her clutches. (Vera Miles, who was a hottie!) The film -- which plays out like an old-fashioned '50s romance comic -- was so dull that I stopped watching, bleary eyed, two-thirds of the way through, but I suspect a drunken car crash may have freed the young lovers from the wife's oppressive yoke. Sluggishly plotted and full of what was meant to pass as glitz and glamour. Pretty silly, and obviously a good candidate for fans of 'Fifties camp culture."
4,just a question,"Why hasn't this movie been put to DVD? this is sad. it's only half a century old yet, it won't go to print and is hardly shown. If someone that is control of this sees this, as a fan, please let it go to DVD please? we humbly thank you. UPDATE******both 1941 and 1961 versions of this movie will be coming out on DVD! 9/24 via TCM. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!"
1,Back Street,the first DVD would not play the second had nothing on it I returned both and was given a refund.I wanted this DVD very much
4,Ontime and Satisfied,I received this item as promsed. No problems at all with delivery. This movie is an all time favorite with an EXCELLENT actress. Looking forward to curling up with my kleenex box each time. :)
5,Tearful tale of love!,"A desperate woman is able to sacrifice everything for the man she loves, regardless he is married and never realized about her. As Becquer said once: It could not be.The plot can be dated for the actual times but the impeccable acting and the powerful cast make a reference for those who love the cinema without concessions."
3,Super-high Melodrama,"Of all the love melodramas I have seen in my rather long life, ""Back Street"" with Susan Hayward goes the furthest to bordering on camp. I won't go into any plot details; nor will I tell you not to watch it. All the performances (except maybe Vera Miles) are solid and sufficient. Production values are high quality, and sometimes overdone. It's the writing that takes this love story on such an unbelievable ride."
3,Cheaper Elsewhere,"This is a handy dandy item, but you can get it for nearly half the price at Active Forever or Allegro Medical. This is an exorbitant price."
5,handy helper,"This has been very helpful for my mother. It is sturdy and easy to use. The hook has been very helpful, which is the main difference between this and the traditional shoe horns."
5,Wonderful Granchild Entertainment,"I bought this book as part of my weekend entertainment plan for my 6 year old grandson. The stay was a success! I think, in great part, due to our sunday morning ""Pancake Party"". We read Hey Pancakes! the night before, I had pre-purchased the ingredients with, of course, real maple syrup and then we reviewed the recipe in the back of the book and discussed what and why of each ingredient and even had a little lesson in measuring. It was great fun for both Grandpa and Grandson. I think it'll be a weekend that'll be remembered."
2,"A good theory-oriented manual, a bit less on practicality!","I have developed applications using Foxpro v2.x for 4 years and shifted to VFP6 quite recently. I opted to go for this book as from the reviews I read, it should get a semi-newbi like me, up and running. On browsing the book, I found out that it wastes too much time on tables and relationships (data structures), and with around 350 pages, not much more space remains.While I do understand that data manipulation and application design are very important, one finds extensive discussions on these topics in software engineering books or gained through experience.Somehow, I was left a bit disappointed and have to go for another manual with more ""how-to-do-it"" instructions."
2,"OK for newbies, but...","This book really helped me get off the ground, but once I reached a certain level of proficiency, it quickly became irrelevant. Many important topics are not discussed, or only discussed if you are using VFP at a very basic level. In fact, I find most of their techniques irrelevant, though their philosophies about development are helpful. I don't recommend this book to anyone with serious VFP development experience."
1,Good album but it's a CD-R!,"I really like this album but I was horrified to open it and discover that it's not a silver, factory-pressed CD but a CD-R! I can't rate it more than 1 star for such a dishonest ruse. Amazon and the aker should state right up front what this actually is. CD-Rs are more susceptible to heat and magnetism than CDs. They are not as stable nor do they have the same longevity. I felt quite cheated by this."
2,plastic Blue dots,I thought I was ordering glass blue dots from the description. When the product arrived I found they were made of plastic.
1,bad,terriable its a plastic peace of garbage.Wont work dont waste ur money.Also they are illegaly but idc about that since there plastic they wont work either way.The real ones are glass
3,Get the Glass Jewel,"Kind of hard to gauge quality on a part you don't install often . But appearances were , quality could have been better . The jewel arrived scuffed and micro-scratched on all of the prism edges , just from frequent contact with it's packaging . Easy install ."
5,oh my.,"Being merely fifteen, the go-betweens were before my time. however, i recently got this album and i am in love with it. i dont love it, i am in love with it. even my tonedeaf seven year old brother appreciates hope then strife, stating that it was his favourite song, along with bigmouth strikes again, by the smiths. bye bye pride could be one of my favourite songs ever, and i dont get tired of this album. buy, buy, BUY!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I really liked the sound of this book and looked forward to reading it. Sad to say, I found it humourless and repetitive, and all so terribly obvious. For someone who has spent so much time in Japan studying Japanese, it's amazing how much of the author's transliteration of Japanese into romaji is incorrect. This is distracting and irritating. This was a great idea for a book, I really wish it had been better."
4,good flow,"I have taken Yoga classes for a couple of years off and on. I am ""obese"" according to weight charts, and over 50. But need to continue the Yoga during non-class periods. I like to be guided because I don't have the discipline to hold the poses long enough my self. This Video is a good guide.I like this video for the flow, length (almost an hour) and routine- stretches many areas. It's well paced so that you can get into all the poses and get to hold the stretch. It is not very strenuous. I can't seem to do the pidgeon pose- puts too much stress on the knees, nor the ""pretzel moves"" I call them of twisting the waist. Need to find other DVD to help me stretch those parts."
2,Extremely disapointing,"I am very surprised at the other reviews of this book. I purchased it based on them and was extremely disappointed.I was looking for something to help me design and architect software for my robotic project. This book is advertised to accomplish that, but after reading through it, I am left short of my goals. The information may be in the book, but it is presented in a boring put you to sleep fashion that is difficult to read or organize your thought process from. Most of the book pushes a robot simulation web site, that no longer exists at the specified address, which speaks to the lack of popularity. The website has been moved to another domain name, but you will find that it has not been updated in several years, again, a seemingly total lack of interest.It's a shame, like I said, it seems like relevant information may be buried inside, waiting for someone to re-present it in a useful format."
4,Excellent introduction to Behavior-based AI,"I first read Jones' previous book (""Mobile Robots: Inspiration to Implementation"") back in 1999 and was very excited to see how simple AI could be.This new book goes much deeper in the art of designing behavior-based robots and does a great job at it. And Even though I had already gainged a lot of experience programming my own robots, I still found it very stimulating and learned a thing or two.I highly recommend this to any aspiring roboticist, and even the old pros!"
4,where has the website gone?Oh there it is again.,"This is a nice little book. It introduces some important concepts in an overall very readable text. Of course the book doesn't offer much technical detail or any real code but sometimes it comes close. If you already have any experience in programming you can easily get the point in the example pseudo codes and adapt them for your own use.There is a major problem about this book though. The online robot simulation program was available from the link given inside the book but this website is not active anymore so you can not practice the ideas using the ""bsim"" program.I have to make a revision about the Bsim applet and the website. The website is up and running but the URL is not [...] anymore. It may be found at [...]. (02.Jan.2010)"
1,Where's the interactive website,"Bought this from Amazon a month ago. The information in the book is fine. I was very excited to try out the interactive simulations in the book, but the website isn't active and the simulation that is not now available."
5,The future is your present thinking made manifest.,"""Liquidate the past and never dwell on old grievances or grudges. The future is your present thinking made manifest.""(37) ""I'm born to succeed; the Infinite within me can't fail. Divine law and order govern my life, Divine peace fills my soul, Divine love saturates my mind.""(70) ""If you do not choose to do your own thinking, the mass mind and the propaganda of the world will make choices for you. There is no such thing as indecision. It simply means you have decided not to decide.""(132) Just a few of the pearls to be mined from this astonishing Miracle Power that can release a flood-tide of abundance into your life. Dr. Joseph Murphy was an internationally known author, teacher, lecturer and Vice-President of the International New Thought Alliance. I have several of his books and love them all. This book is a never-ending source of inspiration and help."
3,Repetition is the mother of skill...,"Repeating, that is what this book does. And by repetition you can get things in your subconscious mind. Have you ead ""The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind"" (what I recommend) than this book is full of the stories you're already familiar with. A small difference: in this book are more quotes from the Bible.My sugestion? Buy ""The Power Of Your Subconscious Mind"" instead."
4,A True Rock Recording,"Songs like ""White Hot"" & ""Don't Fight It"" make this an exceptional classic canadian rock complnlation. I love allthe songs on this cd and it's the best one Red Rider releasedbefore Tom Cochrane Went solo."
4,What a blast!,"I owned this album and lost it during relocations. I haven't heard some of these songs in 30 years, and I was surprised how great and current they still sound. Nothing cheezy or dated about this album: it rocks. And as far as albums go, all but two of the songs are worth listening to multiple times. That is a great track record for any album. If you own anything by Tom Cochrane or Red Rider, you should own this album as well."
4,A great book for an existing user,"If you know the basics, this is a great book to help you along. Almost every chapter has some bit of enlightenment that will enhance your understanding and use of PSE3.However, the author has deliberatly not gone into some of the technical why's and wherefor's, choosing instead to provide some absolutes. For instance with colour managment, he gives some settings which I found don't necessarily always do the job and the lack of additional detail dosn't allow me to modify those setting as needed.Overall though, the best book on PSE3 I have read."
2,My least favorite computer book ever,"Nowhere on the cover does it say that this book is for Windows only. Whole chapters do not apply to Macintosh, and what few suggestions there are for compensating are really lame. But what I REALLY can't stand is the way the book is written. Its author apparently thinks he's the funniest guy on the planet. Nearly every sentence has some stupid joke or smarmy comment. If you want quick information about how to do things in PS Elements 3, this is not your book. In its favor, it's well organized and has lots of good tips, but you have to be willing to slog through way too much self-indulgent and annoying posturing by the author."
2,Frustrating; not for Mac,"The author said that with a few translations of keystrokes one could use Mac and this book. Not so easy...This is frustrating, because I'm not sure what other book might actually teach the Mac version of version 3. There are a lot of very specific techniques in this book, and it's not a bad reference, but it certainly left this Mac user very frustrated and looking for another source."
2,"Might be ok, but the first part is confusing. Would not buy",This book starts off by talking about organizer vs file browser. But it doesn't tell you how to get to the organizer - that WORKS. And it talks about setting up watch folders to get pictures into the organizer. That does not work either. Maybe the author should try to use the software before writing about it.
2,Don't waste your money if you have version 2 of this book,"This book is functionally identical to the one the author put out for version 2 of Photoshop Elements. They changed the example photos, but little else except for a new section on using the Organizer, which is NOT available in the Mac version. Unlike his Photoshop books, where new info and techniques are included in each version, this is just a rehash of the earlier version. Normally, I'm pretty excited to see new books by Kelby, but this experience will cause me to check twice before buying.If you don't have a good Photoshop Elements book already, this is as good a place to start as any."
1,Not if you are new or fairly new at this software program.,"When you're a beginner, this is NOT..NOT..NOT the book you want to learn from. Every document I have picked up so far refers to ""Layers"" and how important they are and in this book you will find nothing. All the information in here is for advanced changes and corrections to pictures. So if you are new at this software, you will accomplish nothing using this reference."
4,A Good Next or companion Book,"If you have a basic working knowledge of Elements 3 or have a book like Barbara Brundage ""The Missing Manual"" this a good companion book to step you through some more advance step's. It is more of a ""how to book"" than a manual to tell you about each basic feature of Elements 3.I would highly recommend buying this book."
5,Elements 3 Book for Digital Photographers,I like the book. Plenty of examples and detailed how-to's.Easy to pick up and leaf through. Not necessary to read from start to finish. Well done.
4,Photoshop Elements 3 - A Great Resource,"I have found Scott Kelby's Photoshop Elements 3 book to be a great help in learning how to use the program. As a new user, I have found at times the book lacks a few of the basics, but perhaps for someone a little more computer literate this would not be a problem. The book gives very straight forward directions on how to perform most tasks and he includes enough humor to keep one from being bored with the text. I would definitely recommend the book."
4,Digital Trickery,"I am taking a course on Photoshop Elements and am using this as the textbook. I am impressed with the ease of following the lessons, and also with the fact that there is a website that provides the pics to practise with. Great program, great book."
4,Only the Best,Scott Kelby is a Master and he is skilled at providing written instruction. This book is worth every penny.
4,Good step-by-step instructions,"I didn't want to read about a lot of photo editing theory. I just wanted some step-by-step instructions that would help me accomplish specific tasks. This book provides that. Lots of images, lots of tips, and lots of steps to follow, all clearly presented. This is a very good Photoshop Elemeents 3 book for photographers. I recommend it very highly."
5,Great for the Pholo Elements Challenged,"For those of you who love to take pictures, but sometimes miss the best shot, this is the book for you. It takes you step by step through common photo improvement techniques, and adds a dose of humor along the way. Scott Kelby anticipates the problems of those of us who can find a way to mess up no matter what and tells us how to proceed. A good read."
1,VERY DISAPOINTED,"This is the worst ""How To"" book for computer use I have ever read. Too much information is left out. Too many questions are unanswered. It makes things look much easier than they are. Save your money! There is no explanation of all the Tools, for example. It did not work for me."
3,New Isn't Always Better,"I tend to agree with the other reviewer. I've been a fan of Ms. Coleman since her first Blind Pig release, and I don't much care for the ""smoothing"" effect that Telarc seems to have had on her style. The album isn't bad by any means, and her voice is as good as ever, but there isn't enough cutting loose on the guitar for my taste (though ""The River Wild"" is a bracing instrumental). The covers are decent enough (especially ""Healing Ground""), but ""When Will I Be Loved"" is a disappointment;stiff and repetitive. If this is your first taste of Coleman's work, make sure you snap up ""Soft Place To Fall"" and ""Soul Be It,"" which are much better reflections of just how terrific she really is."
4,A change of label and style,"With her move to a new label for her, Telarc, Deborah Coleman has moved to a lighter smoother sound with a more mellow sound and less blistering solos. Although this is not necessarily a move for the better, she does a fine job with it. Her singing is as great as always and the instrumental ""River Wild"" is a nice one.A note: when she does these songs in concert, she does them a little ""harder"" and they rock a little more. And when she does her older songs, there's no toning down- they're just as strong as ever. 4.5 Stars"
5,Perfect!!!!!!,"I almost bought a much cheaper stand and I'm so glad I didn't!!!! It is designed to hold virtually any size cookbook and the splatter guard is great. Your book sits on a firm base so you don't have to worry about it falling over AND BEST OF ALL, IT FOLDS TO THE SIZE OF A SMALL-MEDIUM COOKBOOK! I put it on my shelf with my other cookbooks and it takes up virtually no space when not in use and doesn't take up much of the counter when in use either!!! I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THIS ENOUGH!!!"
4,Cookbook Stand,A bit larger than I would like for my small counter top space but does what it is supposed to do....Protect my books/recipes. I do like the foldable storage design.
1,An Embarrassment to the Community,"I am very sad to say I was required to read this book as part of a college course in mythology. I do have an interest in the ancient goddess mythos and had looked forward to learning more. Unfortunately, this book is filled with inaccuracies, half truths, uncited sources and unfounded theories which are presented as facts.The author skips around a lot drawing bits from the history and mythology of several cultures during many eras. From this she pieces together an unsupported construct, using only those facts which relate to her theory and ignoring all the rest.I would encourage anyone interested in the history of goddess mythology to learn more, just not with this book. It is a sad misrepresentation."
2,Buy a Better Humidifier,"Drawbacks:1. The fan is loud, even on ""low.""2. The filters get moldy in about a month. They cost $10 to replace. The cleaning cartridges are ineffective.Positives:1. Runs 18-24 hours on a tank of water.My advice is to spend a few bucks more and get a warm air humidifier that doesn't use filters."
1,Lousy Product,"This humidifier is poorly designed on several levels. First, it is VERY loud - in fact so loud that I could not sleep with it on. Second, after I took it apart to do the weekly cleaning, I had problems getting the filter back in place. The instructions are poorly written and diagrammed as well. And if I had known that this unit requires weekly maintenance, I would never have bought it. It is just too much work.Just a few days later I went to my local Walgreen's and they had a cool mist humidifier on display and running. It was so quiet that I bought one and threw away the Honeywell. My new Walgreen's model is so much better and was also cheaper. I will never buy a Honeywell model again."
2,noisy humidifier,"even on low, this humidifier was too noisy for our purposes. plus, i don't like the filter, considering there are filterless models out there by ""safety first."" the safety first brand was also quiet, as promised."
2,Very Noisy For Its Size,"Compact and fairly stylish. This technology is proven and dependable ==> not much can go wrong here as long as you have water low in impurities/solutes. However small capacity of the tank will work well for small rooms only. The biggest drawback of my particular unit was a VERY loud fan, even at the lowest speed setting most would find it hard to fall asleep with this thing running. To summarize ==> as long as it is not used in a bedroom it may fill the bill for studio apartments to small living spaces. Not suitable for any sleeping quarters due to cheap electric motor."
1,Balraj,This is really a bad product from honey well. It spilt lot of water and make too noise. Never go for this product
5,The Only Thing That Works,"I suffer with severe IBS-C and I've tried many laxatives to relieve my pain, both OTC and prescription. Perdiem is the ONLY thing that works!!"
2,Disapointing,"I am a huge Phantom fan, he's the hero of my childhood, and probably the only comic book hero that has survived the transition. In fact I think he's a better hero than Batman (who by the way I adore). No gadgets, no side kicks. Just his smarts and his pistols. Also The Phantom knows how to have a family life. I remember fondly waiting each Friday afternoon for the paper so that I could get my Phantom fix.However this treatment by Ben Raab doesn't bring back much nostalgia. It is absolutely is atrocious and does nothing for the character. The dialogue is awful and the story silly...since when did the Phantom talk like a California surfer?I hope Moostone replaces him as a scribe. And replaces him with someone who actually understands the character."
5,The Phantom totally rocks.,"Phantom fans everywhere, look out for this new graphic novel about the Phantom. Before spiderman, superman, batman, or even the justice league, there was the Phantom. He is a purple-clad protector of the jungle. This book is definitly there for anyone looking for action, adventure, or just another superhero to idolize. And if you turn out liking the Phantom, there is also a movie(starring Billy Zane, and Catherine Zeta Jones)."
4,Still a classic game!,"A great hex-based game for the historical wargamer, even though it is several years old. Due to it's age (I bought mine used) I had to download a patch to make it work with Windows XP. I also have Battleground's Bull Run which was an earlier game in the series, but mine may be an updated edition since it ran fine first time on XP. I have to say that visually Bull Run is better and clearer. The fields and forests in Chickamauga look as though they are at the end of an extremely severe and long summer (brownish, rather than the lush green of Bull Run). My only gripe is that the A/I (the computer playing one side) in both games is rather weak and passive. It gets a little tedious getting huge Major Victories all the time. It is much better playing human opponents via email."
3,HELP!!!,My daughter is trying to beat the game and is stuck at the supermarket level...i can't seem to figure it out either... of course it could be because i'm not that great at video games but if someone could just post a thing on here and let me know how to get past it i would really appreciate it!Thanks
2,Maybe if you have hours to waste...,"This game takes around an hour and a half to complete. It is VERY slow, boring, and any child under 7 will be bored to pieces after the first scenario of trying to get out of Charlie Brown's house. The narration is too long, you can't speed it up, and once you think you've solved the game and it's over, it continues on and on again.The only way I can recommend this is for young kids 3-5, who just want to see the Peanuts characters interact on screen and the opportunity to click on things and see what they do. Once you have finished the game once, it remembers this and you can now play any one of the game/puzzle sections of it again, but if you take it out of your hard drive completely, you will be back to square one. Other than that, it is very frustrating to play the entire thing."
1,Worst software I have,"I picked this up in the store for my 4 and 6 year old. There is nothing intuitive about this software. You have to read the help file in order to advance to each step. A 4 and 6 year old definitely cannot read the help directions by themselves, so I ended up having to help with this tedious game. My 6 year old got bored. The 4 year old kept wanting to play, but I had to do most of the work until he got to a puzzle or activity. These he could do."
4,Does the job effectively,Have to keep it lined up over a ridge in the wire and it works very effectively.
3,it is really good..........,Got 6 of these to use while pedal boating on our pond. Excellent bargain allowed us to buy plenty of them. Now if I could only get them to deliver the 2 pedal boats I ordered at the same time all would be great.
3,they technically ARE life jackets i guess,"bought an inflatable raft and went on vacation. needed a life jacket for everyone on board. the largest of these would only float with about 50lbs on them, maybe. but they do count as life jackets for those of us who take our rafts out on more than 2 feet of water, but i would learn to swim before i would rely on one of these life jackets."
3,"The quality is fine, but...","I don't like writing bad reviews, but people should know. The yellow one with the white chest strap does NOT come with the white chest strap. It's the same as the orange. The main reason for my 3 stars is that I have written to the company 3 TIMES to ask for compensation, because they charge $2 more for the yellow for no reason. That was from 3 weeks ago and they are not able to respond. I feel neglected, and annoyed that they false advertise the yellow one. All I wanted was that chest strap because I've used these before and they are more secure with the strap. Anyway, it's a fine vest, and works with a backpack, but I wouldn't want to work with this company again."
3,MY EXPECTATION,This product was okay but it wasn't what I expected it to be so I sent it back for a full refund.
2,Life Jacket,"I simply wanted a cheap backup life jacket incase it is ever needed. I would have preferred two sets of straps (you get what you pay for) and I believe the tie under the neck is missing. All and all, it serves its purpose."
3,life jacket,"just what i needed. could not find locally, out of season at walmart? but you had them. thank you"
4,Good,Basic standars vest to keep authorities off your ass while you are fishing. I bought it for my 14-year-old nephew primarily because I wanted him to look like a fool. Worked really well!
2,"Useful, but not that comfortable",I bought this because it was cheap. I need something to keep next to me in the boat but I don't like to wear it. The kids wear theirs but it constricts their movement. These will probably become extras and I'll go buy the nice fitted ones in the summer.
2,Dynamic Joy Division-style goth - LOUSY mastering job,"I'll let the other review describe the music. If you're interested in buying this, it's crucial to know that Cherry Red Records UK have clearly mastered every one of these 26 tracks straight from worn vinyl, and not the actual recording tapes. Many tracks crackle subtly, but it gets worse. The included version of ""Beating My Head"" has bad pitch control, due to Cherry Red's screwups. ""Monkey's On Juice"" literally revs up at the beginning because they didn't prime the record(!?!) right. The track listing is inaccurate and out of sequence. The music itself - when it's mastered at the right RPM - is great and mostly unavailable elsewhere. Cherry Red should be ashamed of themselves. Does the Better Business Bureau apply to despicable English companies?"
4,Success as a Real Estate Agent,"Book is interesting and is helpful, if you are already a real estate agent, as well as a beginner. Atleast you know what to expect starting out in a real estate career."
5,This book should be required reading for all real estate agents!,If you are a real estate agent then you need to read this book. A great informative read! Packed with tons of solid info.Lex Levinrad - Author of Wholesaling Bank Owned Properties
2,Success as a Real Estate Agent for Dummies,"This book does have some usful tips. However, the author is obviously a career salesman. He appears to have grown his career from real estate sales to selling his own products ( seminars, web sites, and sales coaching). He equates financial success by selling, to being a quality agent. His focus seems to be on the typical salesperson's perspective ie. ABC (always be closing), not matching the client to the property they want, like and can aford."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE SERIOUS ABOUT REAL ESTATE SALES,"Whether you're new to the business or have 20 years experience, this book contains all the basics essential for a successful career!"
5,owner and broker,"Great tool for training and motivation, highly suggest every office has a copy on file for agents to review. Follow the steps and have the tools to grow your business."
5,All I can say is THANKS!,"Having been in real estate 15 months now, I can honestly say that I often use this and other Dirk Zeller publications as my career ""bible"". The insights Mr. Zeller offers keep me on track, and when I feel myself sliding back into old patterns, I pull out his books (this is usually a couple of times a week!) Thanks for putting into a book the guidance I'm not able to get from the experienced agents in my office - the funny side of that is I think they would benefit from your book too!"
5,A must read for any real estate agent intent on surviving in the business,"Singularly the best ""self help"" book for real estate agents I have read. This book contains virtually everything an agent must implement to be successful in real estate in today's changing marketplace."
5,Really Excellent,"Excellent book with lots of great ideas and encouragement, very well organized and presented. Don't be fooled by the title--anyone who reads this book is very smart to do so. I highly recommend this book especially to newcomers. Easy and fun to read with so much good information that I can't wait to read it again. Dirk Zeller is one of the most respected trainers in real estate."
5,Great for bad backs and old men!,"After using a variety of ramps, stands and a folding engine hoist to remove items from my utility trailers, I thought I would try using this hoist instead. The 115V outlet that the garage door opener uses was in the perfect place for the hoist. A width of 1/8 x 2"" square steel tubing spans the shop from side to side, with this hoist mounted to a short length of of 3/16 x 2 1/4"" tubing. After seveal months and many uses, this is great for anyone with a bad back. The controller is easy to keep out of the way and the hook/cable work perfectly. Some teflon lube makes sliding easy. Great product, price and design."
1,German Junk,"These Spax screws are worthless. Put your arm into it and the heads immediately round out. God help you if you need to take something apart, cuz you'll be breaking it out with a crow bar. Your driver bit won't bite anything to pull the screw out because the pot metal heads reamed out on the way in. German engineering? World class product? German junk."
1,VERY MISLEADING!!!! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Wow, this product is awful. About 5% of this CD has to do with self confidence and even those are lackluster and poorly delivered ""affirmations"". I couldn't believe how substandard this was. Do yourself a favor and keep on researching until you find something else that is what's promised."
2,Kind of hard for a child to build,"The key part that holds the bottom to the top is only barely glued together and when you try to nail it together it simply breaks. Kind of embarrassing when the wife and kid are both sitting there watching your expertise and the bird feeder is slowly disintegrating. I managed to get it to stay in one big piece with more glue from the garage and more nails, looks ok now but the wooden parts need a redesign to actually work."
4,Lunatic Fringe is the one,"I never got to hear the whole album. The only time I heard this group was when MTV used to play Lunatic Fringe. I spent years looking for anything by Red Rider. If the rest of the album is even half as good ,I will be happy."
1,PhD from defunct non-accredited distance learning school,"I encourage customers to do a little research on this ""science"" before purchasing. His PhD is from a defunct non-accredited distance learning school and there are serious questions on this ""science.""[...]"
3,Informative but too restrictive,"I enjoyed reading the easy to understand explanations of the science of acid-base balance. However, the proposed diet plan would be extremely hard to follow unless someone was very dedicated and motivated to make this lifestyle theirs."
4,a good book for health,Well it has a lot of information and a lot of suggestions. Not too thrilled that its seems mostly vegetarian BUT a lot of the stuff is very helpful
4,EXCELLENT PLAN,"I LOVE this plan. Its an excellent idea and I felt 1000% better after the first three days and then tried to eat something that was not on the plan and was flooded with a headache, and body pains like crazy.I gave the book 4 stars because I would like a ""Menu"" plan . . . suggestions to eat this for breakfast, this for a snack and this for lunch etc. He gives really great information, just not how to combine foods so you don't feel hungry. The recipes in the back are excellent, but I wish they were better ""catagorized"", such as this is what you eat for balancing PH, this is what you eat when you are done balancing your PH etc. I would see a recipe that I would like to try and only read from their ""reward"" that it was a transitional recipe.I have recommened this book to several of my diabetic friends. I have had EXCELLENT sugar levels using the diet and my asthma has improved dramatically!"
1,very disapointed,"My 9 year old has been driving me crazy for this green machine for christmas! So we bought him one for christmas and it is already broke, the front wheel is just spinning and it will not move! Very sad little boy! What am I supposed to do with this 100 dollar broken toy, I threw the box away just the same day it broke! Who do I contact to fix this!? Please let me know!"
1,Mini-Green,"I agree with what others are saying. Nowhere does it point to the fact that you will be getting a ""mini"" green machine. I ordered two and did not realize the size until I had one put together. Fortunately, my kids can still ride it with the seat placed all the way back. Will have outgrown this toy by summer. If I didn't have younger ones, I would be infuriated."
1,DO NOT BY FROM ETOYS!!!!,"I, too, ordered the green machine as pictured and received the black 16"" ""mini""; unfortunately, it was christmas eve for us as well when we discovered this. I am very disappointed and feel cheated...I have emailed Etoys but have still not heard back from them."
1,I didn't get it either,"I ordered this in early november and didn't receive the pictured item either. I received the mini also...and now ETOYS says they are out of the 20"" so they are refunding my money. ETOYS is supposedly having it picked up free of charge...but for three days in a row DHL has refused pick up...we'll see.Biggest problem.....my kids are sooo disappointed!"
1,LOW QUALITY OF FRONT TIRE!,"FRONT TIRE WILL NOT HOLD AIR! IT IS HARD TO FILL UP FRONT TIRE. FRONT TIRE SHOULD BE HARD RUBBER, AS BACK WHEELS. WE ONLY KEPT ""MASHINE"" BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO PUT TOGEATHER."
4,Son Loves It,"Another wonderful item bought off of Amazon, [...] Ok onto the item itself. It wasent that hard to put together but is easier with two people. For the price the wheel cover and some of the other parts are plastic, they should of been metal instead of just the main frame and handles for durability. Back tires are plastic like what you would find on a 3 wheel Hot wheel. Which is good for skidding out but if it is used alot wont hold up long not very thick. Fun factor, son does love it so I will give it thumbs up on that. As far as educational, really its not meant for that but does help tune coordination. Overall it is worth its weight in gold if your kid loves it, a plus frame has limited lifetime warranty."
2,Broken Front Axel,My son got this for Christams and loves it. He uses it almost daily. However now one week after gettign it the front axel is stripped and he can no longer use it. When he pedels the pedeal spin inside the axel and will not move. Any toy that breaks in the first week gets a very low rating.
4,Great to see the green machine still out there!,"Kids love this thing - my wife and I have even ridden on it. This is the real deal, and can't even be compared to a big wheel. Big wheels these days are cheap (pick 'em up at Target, WalMart, etc for dirt cheap) but they're built that way now, too. Fall apart quickly, and can't take anything compared to the green machine. You could go through 5 big wheels while this green machine would still be running strong, I bet. Do the math on that...Didn't get the full 5 stars as this thing can't be run in tight places. You need serious space around to do turns and such. ""Turning diameter"" on this thing is measured in yards, while a big wheel can turn within just a few feet."
5,Greatest X-mas gift EVER!!!!!,"I bought this for my son for X-mas 2009. It did take me about an hour to put it together, mostly because it was missing a screw. I did find another in the garage that worked perfectly! My son has an anxiety disorder which prevents him from riding his regular bike. When I saw the green machine, I thought what the heck, lets go for it! It sits very low to the ground so he doesnt have the fear of injury like with a regular bike. Since we live in Iowa, he rides it in the basement right now but LOVES it!!! It turns on a dime and makes it easy for him to manuver around the beams and pipes down there. He cant wait for the snow to melt so he can go outdoors with it!!! THANK YOU HUFFY FOR A SUPER GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!"
5,LOVE IT,"I had a Green Machine when I was little and never forgot about it. Now that my son just turned 5yrs old, I suprised him for his birthday and he loves it as much as I did. Adults can ride it too as I found out due to the machine can hold up to 180 LBS. My son and I now take turns"
3,Huffy Green Machine,"The packaging used to send this product is inadequate. As a result there were missing parts and broken parts. The company that sent it (Fogdog) was not very cooperative in replacing the parts. In fact, they would not do so. Their policy is to send the old one back and order a new one. When you face time constraints such as a birthday, that is not a very good way to fix it. I did go directly to Huffy and they sent replacement parts but one of them was also broken. All in all an unpleasant experience."
5,Fun!!!!!!!!!!,"My son saw it under the tree and his first response was ""I didn't ask Santa for anything that big"".After he took if for a spin he loves, loves, loves it and so do the kids in the neighborhood.They take turns riding (I even took it for a spin). Highly recommend. Keep in mind that the age restriction is for height not age I would guess. My 6 year old (who is average size for his age) has the seat moved all the way forward."
4,"Fun, but good for kids over 7 or 8 - it will flip over",Santa brought my six year old a green machine. He likes it and it will spin quickly but it will flip over. I rode it and it flipped with me. My 9 yr old daughter rode it and it flipped and she skinned her knee. Definitely wear a helmet with this one. We bought my son a Razor 360 until he gets a little older so that he can handle the green machine.
1,ruined Xmas,"The Green Machine arrived today by Fed Ex in the Huffy packaging whith the picture and information all over it. My nine year old answered the door and now wants me to return it because it ruins the surprise of Christmas. This was his ""big"" present and I am so dissapointed that it could not have been more discreetly shipped!"
3,NOT AS PICTURED,"We thought we were ordering this Green Machine a few weeks back. It arrived today. Unfortunately, the one we got is NOT the one pictured here. It is a Green Machine Mini, 16"" front wheel, black with green. We chose the one pictured here because it has a higher back than the newer versions. The Mini has a seat back that does come up higher than the other new versions, but does not look to be as high as the one pictured here. It also has a hand brake (a plus, in my opinion) and is more black in color than green. Overall it is still a very cool Machine and we will not be returning it since my boys love it. I just want everyone to be clear that you will probably not get the one pictured here if you order it from here!"
4,Mean Green Machine,"This is a fun toy that we've had for about a month. Purchased for my boy's 6 yr birthday and he rides it often. Adults and parents beware that this is a big machine and you'll ride it too! However, both my wife and I seem to flip this thing when we crank the wheels due to adult size/weight issues. My son cranks the wheels and spins out but I seem to make the wheels ""grab"" resulting in a ""flip"" due to my extra weight so beware. Overall this will be a fun toy for years to come. It stretches the size limits of my 6 yr old and my 3 yr old really wishes he could reach the pedals. It's quite a conversation piece in the garage and I see it as a fun toy for all for years to come."
4,With They Handn't Changed the Seat!,"They had two Green Machines at Toys R Us recently. The new one (pictured here) I do not like as much because it has no seat back! The older version had a back to the seat so you could actually lay back and not have to hold yourself up all the time.Otherwise, its a great ride and even at 34 I love it! My kids were kinda short to drive it though I must admit- the 8-1/2-year-old was barely able to reach the pedals."
5,awesome toy,okay i asked for this for my one year wedding anniversary! adults can have fun too. i cruise the neighborhood all the time on my green machine and now everyday i have the neighborhood boys asking if they can play on it. i would recommend a helmet though. my husband has almost flipped it several times! Whoo woo!!! fun times
5,The Green Machine Rocks,"Bought this retro Green Machine for my daughter's 8th birthday. It was surprisingly easy to setup and riding it is a blast (yes I had to try it too and at 168 lbs, it handled me). A couple of pleasant upgrades from what I remember of the original back in the day. There is more metal, the front tire is no longer plastic, but similar to an inflatable bicycle tire. It only goes forwared and free spins when petaling backwards (improved safety) and the break is now located on the right shifter stick as opposed to the old school brake by the rear tire. All and all a great well put together product that should see years of fun times. Great excerise for children in this day and age of motorized scooters and such. Very durable. Easy seat adjustment."
5,Green Machine Fun,Very cool toy! My son loves it. There's nothing like a toy that was designed to spin it out. I was also pleasantly surprised with the quality of construction. It should last for a long time.
3,You will not get this toy...,"As per a previous poster, you will not be getting this exact bike if you order here. I purchased the green machine for my son for Christmas. However, the item received is mostly black in color with green lightning-type markings on the front wheel. The item is a green machine MINI with a 16 inch front wheel. Nowhere in the description of this item does it say ""mini"". Be forewarned - the item displayed here on the site is not the item you will receive. Disappointed."
5,Silent and terrific,"This cooler is super-quiet to silent, depending on how you set the variable fan speed (and the lowest speed will work for many people). The mix of aluminum and copper helps make it far lighter than all-copper fans with only a couple of degrees C loss of cooling. Works with a variety of processors. It's big, though -- make sure it will fit on your motherboard and in your case before ordering. Most newer motherboards will be fine with this -- the stock processor that came with my Athlon 64 was as big as this one."
5,Overheating Problems Solve,"I just have one word for describe this product: AMAZING!, if any of you person tired of overheating problems i really solved it with this, and also it's pretty silent.Computer Comfiguration:Case IntelIntel 865GLCPentium IV 3.2 1Meg Cache1 Gig RAMAti Radeon 9600xtSata 160gb3Com Sblive"
3,"Historically accurate, but not enough actual footage.","I enjoyed the show and appreciated what others had to say about her from personal experience. It was certainly historically accurate. I would have liked to have seen more actual footage of Mother Teresa, though. The few glimpses were precious but rare. I purchased it for my 8th grade Bible class and they enjoyed it, but found the commentary a little over their heads. A good show to help explain 'compassion' by seeing it in action."
2,Mere Tales,"Ms. Blyton came up with a condensed version of some Arabian tales. Slaying and death seem to be the main topic of each story. Although the narrations are fascinating the gist of each is nil. One tale even validates that it is okay to be lazy because magic could happen to make one rich. I might have enjoyed the stories when I was a child but rereading them I question my interest in them back then. The change in times, cultures, and events may play a big part in my present outlook on the stories but I still regard Ms. Blyton as one of the top children's writers of all times."
4,"Adorably, cute.","This book is a very cute book for teenagers. I mean, we all have friendships of our best friends that end as we get older. This book deals with two girls going out to Spring Break. At first, they don't have much incommon and dread the fact that they came together. But than, they quickly realize that it was foolish not to be friends.This book is very cute and good.. Not the best-but deffinately something worth reading!"
5,most amzing book ever,oh my god i just finished reading this book it was amazing.. i seriouly thought it was the best book i ever read!If you like faking 19 you'll definitly like this book ;-).. they were both amazing books and anyone reading this should really read them =)
1,Depressing,"And women are worried about men when there are terrible books like this around...written by women?!Also: surely these whorish writers are being paid for ""product placement"" - the books are littered with brand names which by the way will make them seem very dated in a NY minute.Born in 1979 in NYC, the author has a B.A. from Vassar. Depressing.Reading the reviews was equally depressing. Maybe they were written by friends of the author or her family?Ouch, ouch, ouch. I have less and less hope for humanity."
2,South Beach Bomb,"I am not quite sure how to describe this book other than calling it free advertisement for everything from clothing and accessories to Apple iPods. I almost stopped reading it many times because I just could not handle the in your face advertising. It made me wonder if she was getting paid to market the brands. I can understand that brand recognition is important to kids, and would have played a part in the story maybe and just maybe if the conflict was between the haves and the have nots; not just two girls who had ""grown apart.""This book may be worthwhile however if you are just looking for some mindless or mindnumbing reading."
3,South Beach,"I especially Holly, who throughout the book had a struggle to become more her own person. It was interesting how she became more comfortable with her body and who she really was.I, however, didn't like to hear the characters lying so much.I also had problems with the underage drinking. I was glad Holly didn't actually have sex."
5,Entertaining Timecapsule of Elton!!,"The Elton John Scrapbook is a very entertaining book that manages to balance the music and man. While this book focuses on the more lighthearted aspects of his career with many highlights, you'll find a good 'ol fashion bio as well. A light read but worth exploring to get a different perspective on the entertainer's music over the last 3 decades. Also, an indepth profile of lyricist Bernie Taupin, terrific album reviews and tons of pictures. There's a section on fans as well and what his music has meant to them. Yours truly contributed a couple of segments as well so I'm a little biased! Worth the money and a must for Elton die hards."
3,Book is fair at best,"While I felt that there was some humor in this book, it was nothing to wright home about. There was some good tips that all seemed to be rehashed from Rutters other book "" fly fishing made easy"". of the two books on fly fishing that Rutter has Written was far more infomative as a guid to learning to fly fish. One book from him would have been plenty."
1,Not worthwhile,"there are much better books out there, whether you're a beginner, intermediate or advanced. This book offers nil."
2,Not as adverstised,"This bag does not come with a 32 inch strap. The strap is about ten inches long. Just got it today, and now will have to return it.***This is an update to my review. Returned the bag using easily obtained return shipping label. Customer service was very helpful, and the order was processed and refunded quickly. Still a bother that the bag was not as advertised, but this company made returning it easy and quick. So they got that going for them, which is nice."
2,Book was okay,"The plot was predictable but still mildly entertaining. If you like this genre then you're better off the a Vince Flynn or Nelson DeMille novel. The main disappointment with this book was the HUNDREDS of typos, misspellings and left out or incorrect words. At times it actually made it hard to follow the plot. How can a book make it into publication with this many errors? It's as though this was the original manuscript before going through any proofreading."
4,Book useful for new-comers to Bison Business,"This book, published and distributed by the National Bison Association, has a ton of information for the start up bison producer. From the basics like fencing and feeding to tips on selling meat. I definately recommend purchasing this book."
1,Broken Crystal,"I received this watch yesterday and the crystal has cracked and fallen off the face. I am VERY disappointed. The crystal is not flush with the face it is raised, which makes the crystal vulnerable to damage. Over the years, I've bought many Fossil watches (5) and have NEVER had a problem like this. Unfortunately, the watch is not covered for this type of damage, so I'm out the cash after less than 24 hrs of use."
4,Heavy Duty,"Again, a watch without acknowledging movement maker. Has day/date and sizing is a breeze. This is a heavy watch and keeps good time. The price for a Fossil at under $40.00 is a steal.Easy to read, only during lighted conditions. Has a double safety clasp, not found on cheaper watches. A bargain at this price."
2,OLD STUFf,Product looks old and worn. Why do they try to fool people into buying these foolish things. Why cant they be as honest as possible. Anyway DO NOT BUY
2,fossil watch,"hey i have ordered for a new watch but the piece is like old one, metal strap is not looking new i thought of returning it but i had no time as i was going out of country and i ordered it as a gift for my frnd.The watch is real looking old"
1,"I usually find GREAT deals on Amazon, but.........","I usually find GREAT deals on Amazon, but.........I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. The watch price was wonderful, but when I received it their was so much tarnish it looked used. Thank goodness I did'nt send it directly to the recipient. I quickly returned this product and will use more caution in my future purchases."
2,Sticky button with painfull grooves,"This sustain pedal has a tendency to stick and make a loud clicking noice when you use it. Also the top of the pedal has deep grooves so if you try to use it with bare feet, its really uncomfortable."
1,Very Unrealistic (for Piano),"I was hoping this would have more of a piano feel to it. This pedal requires a lot of pressure to get any sustain out of my casio keyboard. If I have shoes on and ""stand"" on the pedal, it will sustain the notes I play. It is far from the lighter touch I am used to on a real piano. On a real piano, I can let my heel rest on the floor and with light pressure on the pedal it will depress fully. It would be nice if they made the tension adjustable. Also, it is just an on-off switch. In other words, the degree of sustain does not vary (as it does with a piano), making it even more unrealistic. I would recommend shopping around if you want a piano-like pedal, or if you want a pedal that does not require a lot of pressure to work."
4,Good stuff,"Good book, enough pictures to entertain without any thought and enough insight to actually learn something. Step by step diagram ananlysis on on a basic circut degsign and a n amp build very interesting."
4,My First Guitar Amplifier build from scratch DIY Project,"This book was very educating and fun to read, learned a lot and was a great start point to get into building my own guitar tube amplifier. I recommend it if you know nothing about the inner workings of an Amp and want to learn how everything in the tube amp works and how every component affects your tone."
4,Great & Detailed Material - Better Than Aspen Pittman Books,"This book is somewhat similar to the tube amp book by Aspen Pittman but I think it is much better. Dave has included several interviews by very knowledgable people in the world of tube amps, most notably Ken Fisher.While the book does not contain any real amp modification suggestions, it does have various philosophies on modifications and the persuit of great tone.I was pleasantly supprised and would buy it again.-Don"
5,The Guitar Amp Handbook,A excellent read for the guitarist. While technically interesting this goes into the subtle nuances of sound and tube amplifiers. Many myths are put to rest while the roots of some expanded and verified as true. All aspects of the tube amp from speakers and circuits to the enclosure are addressed. As a bonus famous amp builders are interviewed and the stories they tell are worth having this book regardless of the rest...I thoroughly enjoyed this book and believe you will as well
3,A little bit on the dry side,"The book's title is ""Guitar Handbook-Understanding Tube Amplifiers..."". I am a long time guitar player, not an amp technician. I found the author's text to be more detailed and dry than I expected. The book is informative but for me took time to digest and understand."
4,Hobbyist DIY,Great for the entry level hobbyist. Would help to go more in depth with tube theory and how to size other components.
3,have not owned it long enough,I need some more time with it.I was hoping for more technical info than it seems to offer.I'm looking for more schematics and repair info
5,"A ""Noobie"" Must Have","Although I have been building vintage clones for several years, this book clearly defined terms that I have seen in amp building forums that before made little sense to me. I shared this book with my 23 year old son, who is just getting into amp building. It was a great motivating factor in our first build together. I wish I would have had it years ago."
3,Good - not fantastic,"Some parts of this video may seem a bit hokey, and even funny. I hadn't known that the Beatles had planned on starring in a Lord of the Rings movie - thank goodness they didn't! But there are some primary words and interviews with Tolkien here - not very long, but some precious insights to his mind. This video covers in some detail how Tolkien began writing the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. It describes Tolkien's literary fascination, and his amazing capacity to invent new languages. That in itself was fascinating. The movie was made before the Peter Jackson films, so don't buy it expecting special effects. It is a brief, but informative documentary."
1,TERRIBLE,"This has to be one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen. On top of being a low budget, ridiculously shallow look at Tolkien, the brand new copy I bought skipped. I have returned it."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!,Basically a sh***y home video of some dudes in costa rica surfing.Even the label on the DVD looks like it was made on a printer at home. I'm so pissed I wasted my money on this garbage!0 out of 5 stars!!!!!!
5,Exhilarating classic,"In my opinion, the (Southern) (Death) Cult at their most energetic, creative and politically charged peak. As far as recordings, my favorite of Ian and Billy's studio work. Long Live Death Cult! That's badddd medicine....."
2,Disappointed,"nice watch, but it says they are real diamonds, but they are crystals! I can't believe they would lie to customers. I will not shop online again. It really pisses me off."
2,Ridiculously Boring,"It took me a little while to get through this anticlimactic book! The only redeeming quality was the setting, a tropical island. The story left nothing to the imagination, it was totally predictable and each chapter gave the views of every character. When you know where everyone is at every moment, there's no mystery. It's a very predictable story that did not keep me on the edge of my seat!"
2,The Dominant Blonde,This book arrived expediently but was extemely bent and the cover was severely torn; it had been crammed into an envelope that was way too small. It was listed as being in very good condition.
4,Beach Book,This book was great. I read it while I was on a cruise in 2002. I loved it. I hope you do as well. It is easy light reading that you should love.
1,Horrible,"This book ... is poorly written. Alyssa Kwitney's writing style doesn't flow smoothly, thus making this book hard to piece together and read. Many of the characters are undeveloped and many are uneeded. Lydia is a ... immature woman who doesn't know what she wants to do with her life, so she settles for being a ""trophy wife"" to Abe. Whenever the plot gets weak ... Lydia and Liam have some mind-blowing sex session, followed by either (1) Lydia pigging out on sandwhiches, (2) Lydia saying she lost her birth controll pills, making Liam go on a drinking binge, or (3) Lydia crying out of happiness that she's actually had an orgasm for the first time in her life ""without anyone else in the room."" What a waste of money."
2,A big disappointment,"This seemed like it would be a fun read, but unfortunately the writing is not very good and the plot is ridiculous. I almost gave up about two-thirds of the way through, but hung in there for the ending. One thing that was kind of odd was that the writer seemed completely obsessed with describing the main characters [physical attributes]! They are mentioned continually! It got really aggravating after a while. Oh, you've gone half a page without mentioning her huge heaving chest. Really weird. She's thinking about her chest, her boyfriend mentions her chest, another guy stares at her chest, she walks across the room and her chest bounces along with her. OK!! OK!! She's got a big chest, move on with the story!"
2,Not what I expected...,"After reading the back cover, I had hoped for a fun beach read. This book was a disappointing waste of time. The main character is a sobbing basketcase and the other characters were unlikeable as well. I almost didn't even finish it, but I forced myself to make it to the end."
3,Dominant Blonde,I think the title of the book over exaggerates the main character's attitude. She is not dominant in anyway but helpless and stupid in many. It's an ok read but didn't quite entertain me.
3,Good until the end,I really enjoyed the book during the begining and middle sections but was left dissapointed with the ending. The story is ver built up and then just when you think it is all going to be worth it you are left with nothing. My advice: read up to the last few chapters and the create your own ending.
2,Mundane and fluffy,"This one gets a ""P"" for predictable. I mean, I enjoy a fluffy romance once in a little while, but this story is completely transparent and contains far too many holes. This book reads like a sit-com, complete with the neat and tidy ending. Some of the characters have potential, like Abe's ""sister"" and the former English teacher, but they just aren't developed and come off rather dull. This is a shame... But, if you like a one-sitting romance read, then you might enjoy The Dominant Blonde."
4,"Fun, Sexy Reading Material","I just HAD to purchase this book once I read an excerpt of it in one of my magazines. I read The Dominant Blonde while on vacation at the beach this summer, and have read it a second time since then. I enjoyed reading the book because it's a fun book with an interesting storyline, but my husband just called it ""fluff."" If you are looking for a great way to simply relax and destress, you definitely need to try this book."
2,What a disappointment,"I expected a light read, and got even less than that. Kwitney writes briskly and uses language well; I'll give her that. But the plot was so painfully predictable, the twists so superficial, and the characters so flat that I had a hard time keeping enough interest to finish the book. The sex scenes were absurd, really worthy of the cheesy series romances. In all, I could have spent my time and money in much better ways."
5,"Fun book - plot twists, mystery and romance in the tropics!","I like all of Kwitney's books, and this was no exception. Well-written and entertaining, with plenty of plot to keep it interesting. Her characters (as always) are flawed enough to be both believable and likeable."
3,Overpriced for a DIY shelf,"I purchased the three-tiered version of this shelf about five years ago and it is still standing. That is really the only praise I can offer for this item. It is a snug fit for some books on the bottom two shelves, and putting larger volumes on the upper shelf makes it a little top-heavy. Additionally, thin items tend to slip down the sides since the side panels do not quite perfectly abut the shelves. The construction is a lightweight tubular steel with lightweight steel shelves and wire side panels. The real laugh in all of this is I purchased mine for under $15, which is quite honestly what it is worth."
5,45 lb Bumper Plates Black Solid Rubber Pair,"Speedy shipping!!! Love the weights!!! Most importantly, they are safe for my little ones who are always in & out of the home gym!!! Couldn't ask for anything else!!! Thank You!!!"
1,"Convoluted, stylistically challenged...","This e-book is logically organized and the preface provides a convincing rationale for the setup. But the problem lies in the actual content. I'm sure the authors are great professors and knowledgeable but I think they need a lesson on writing. Wow. It's hard to find a clear sentence/paragraph. The text is convoluted, muddled, and stylistically challenged. This is my first e-book return ever."
5,Love this workout!,This is my second Workout America VHS tape. I bought the first one in 1995 and it finally bit the dust. I was so happy to be able to order a new one and work out with Joan Lunden and her friends again.
4,"Amazon, you found it!","I have been looking for this little book for a year. I was so happy when it turned up. Thank you, thank you. It came to me very quickly, was priced reasonably, and when I received it, was just as described."
3,not the Atmananda (Krishna Menon) who was Jean Klein's guru,"I ordered this book because Francis Lucille is a well-loved teacher of mine and his teacher, Jean Klein, was taught by Sri Atmananda, also called ""Krishna Menon"", who lived in Kerala and is not alive any more.THIS IS BY A DIFFERENT SRI ATMANANDA!Buyers should know that the Atmananda who's talks are in this book is a different man and he is alive. His teachings don't strike me as being very non-dual, or similar to Francis Lucille's or Jean Klein's. I don't want anyone else to order this book expecting this. It can be confusing when teachers have the same name! That said, I didn't care for the book. To me it seems to have more in common with Sri Aurobindo's outlook, and I was looking for something else.So it seems unfair for me to rate this book, since it might be ""the perfect cup of tea"" for someone else!Yet I wanted to enter this review so that buyers would not make the same mistake as I and buy it hoping for Jean Klein's guru."
1,Not so nice,This R2D2 has a fixed center wheel that prevents more realistic movement and play. The kind you would find at Kohls or Target are of a higher quality. Unhappy with the purchase
3,Didn't work out for me.,This did not fit my loveseat well. I hated the elastic band. My loveseat didn't have wide arms so maybe that was it. Maybe you will have better luck.
3,Beautiful Color,"I love the color, but it really doesn't fit as well as I expected given the ""sure fit"" claim. The back of it is over a foot off the floor, which probably won't matter to most people, but my love seat is not against the wall, so I'm disappointed about that. One sitdown on it and it gets really sloppy, so you'll constantly be tucking and tugging to try to keep it looking okay."
2,slippery slipcover,This slipcover won't stay on despite being tied and tucked in. The lining is slippery and the fabric is very thin. I am disappointed and wish that I had returned it. It is also a little large for the love seat.
2,Horrid. Go rent a few movies instead.,"The author returns to the same source material far too often -- the variety of movies from which the quotations and trivia are taken is seriously lacking. Coupled with the flawed layout and cheap feel of the book, and you get one large waste of time. Save yourself the grief of reading this ... and go rent a handful of DVDs."
2,wonderful records he did when he was a complete superstar,"Baby Don't You Tear My ClothesJames CottonTelarc Records CD-83596www.telarc.comJust can't love it. It isn't that it isn't world class Chicago blues harmonica, but that it's not as good as anything James Cotton did before throat cancer took his voice, because it doesn't have his powerful, downhome vocals and ""Got to th'ow down right now"" phrasing alongside the harmonica wizardry. Instead, it has a touch of what must have been extremely painful Cotton vocals and a lot of big name guest singing that, to this critic, puts James Cotton in a sideman role he is too good for.Honor James Cotton. Honor him by buying the string of wonderful records he did when he was a complete superstar."
3,this isn't one of your better horror Stories,I wasn't even going to write a review for this book! But here its goes! The plot was wishy washy the characters were hard to get to know! The ending left with a lot to be desired! We'll never know if Lidias baby turned out al right are not. This girl need to learn a little more about writing an she would be alright!
1,If only no stars was an option...,HORRIBLE!!!TERRIBLE!!!A book about a 13 foot chicken monster who sucks the brains outa peoples skulls. COME ON! The worst book I have ever read.
1,Just painful.,"A young couple moves into a house with a grisly past. One of them is aware of this; the other is oblivious until she begins to see horrific images in the basement. The novel belabors this situation for about three quarters of the way, after which the plot takes a serious left turn that everyone but the protagonist can see coming. Girón throws in a lot of weirdness for weirdness' sake, such as a man who can remove his skin to feed his company of wolves, but none of it is ever justified. It all leads up to a climax where the ultimate villain of the book is defeated by someone throwing a stick at it. Really.The prose is terrible, as is the dialogue. Nobody uses contractions so they all sound like robots at one time or another. Where was the editor? Perhaps he or she didn't think it worth the trouble.Leisure has published some great work that you won't want to miss. This isn't one of them"
1,Book of Pain,"This book will serve as an inspiration to all aspiring writers. The fact that someone actually published this thing means that there is hope for us all. House of Pain is awful on just about every level. The characters are unrealistic; the motives silly and juvenile; the dialog clunky and downright stupid. Trite and superificial all come to mind when I think of this book (which I try not to do). At the end of the day this book is an insult. Giron is a phoney... she wants to be a writer but doesn't write. I think the fact that the plot (if you could call it that) lent itself to creepy cover art and an interesting blurb are the only reasons this thing was published. Anyone who praises this book -- anyone -- is lying out of some ulterior motive, such as: they are the writer's friend or they know their own work is just as bad and hope somebody will reciprocate by being merciful on them."
2,House of Pain,Very slow moving book. First 200 pages are mostly dreams and flashbacks. Writer has some talent but she must learn to pick up the pace.
3,Could have been much better,"A couple of boys witness the demolition of a house where a couple of serial killers lived and tortured and mutilated their victims. Years afterwards one of the boys buys a new house, built on the same spot where the previous was, and moves in with his wife. Strange things start happening and it all leads to an ancient demon being brought into our world. Good concept and beginning, then bad writing and a final confrontation, which is plainly stupid."
3,Evil is as Evil dwells,"Not a bad horror story. Based on the horror premise that when horrible things happen somewhere, there is left a trace. In this book, the site was a house where unspeakable acts were performed by the family living there. They were discovered and the town rose up and demolished the house.Back in present day, a boy who watched the house's destruction with his friends, now owns the land and has built a new house. But he has failed to tell his wife the history of the place or that their house has some of the original basement.Well, evil things begin to happen and the wife begins to get scared. What is going on in her house? Evidence begins to build and we get some interesting plot twists.The plot is quite good, but it suffers from being to vague at the start. It is herd to pinpoint when things begin to build, but the do get started and the book becomes pretty interesting.A good book for horror fans who like stories where evil is a force unto itself and that it can infect people."
4,Its a fuse!!!,Just as the title says its a fuse. Nothing really special about this transaction as a whole except for the fast delivery. I didnt mind the cost if only because I needed it and nobody had them locally. If I need any more of these I will definitely be coming back to these guys!
3,Saccharine CD,"The singer is a little too, too sweet.This is not a favorite CD of mine. Wouldn't recommend it to others."
2,Arrogance and early war tourism in Yugoslavia.,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. The two Balkan Wars of the 1912-1913 were bloody affairs, and it is a shock to see a writer of the British aristocracy treat them with contempt. Joyce seems to more concerned with what he is eating, and his fellow countrymen's particular personalities than with reporting the bloody conflict. Only in the later part of the book do we get a view of some of the conflict's results. Perhaps this was strictly a personal journal of the writer's own feelings and was not meant for publication. If that is so, it shows the disdain this author had for the victims of the Balkan Wars.There is not much info in this book. If one likes his novels, then this may be a book to read. For the historian, forget this book."
1,very disappointed and would not recommend,"I purchased the PalmOne Zire 31 Handheld PDA with the anticipation I would be able to use it away from my computer. Unfortunately, though I was able to get it to work while plugged into electricity, once you unplug it, the device does not work. When you plug it back in the device has lost everything you've entered. I also sent a communication to Amazon asking for help with the seller and did not receive a reply."
3,Designer body lotion,"I like to try body lotions first before purchasing fragrances. I have never used any of the Burberry frangrances before, so I opted to try the body lotion first. I was expecting to experience light frangrance with white flower notes. I actually purchased 3.3oz size bottle, just to play it safe in case I did not like it.This body lotion is very rich. It is thick, but absorbs quickly. If applied on the entire body it will provide nice hint of frangrance. But the frangrace itself is too sweet for my taste. For that reason, I use it on the weekends when I am home, I do not wear it to work. Due to its sweetness, I will not purchase a fragrance."
4,The series nears it's end...,"In the second to last volume of this series, things get even more intense, if that's possible. Milla has a more prominent role, which is good because I like her quite a bit, though she and Tal continue in separate storylines for now. Tal's quest to save his family has become a far bigger struggle. Now, the future of the world of the Chosen and the Icecarls itself is threatened. Milla has taken command of her people as War-Chief, and must lead a fierce battle against Castle, while trying to come to terms with her own confused feelings of inadequacy and guilt. Needless to say, the plot is explosive, the characters deep and easy to relate to, and the descriptions paint a vivid picture of this vibrant world. Definitely read the series from the beginning, and buy them all at once! This author has a terrible affinity for unbearable cliffhangers..."
2,Did not work with PS/2 KVM keyboard connection,"I bought this adapter with the intent to connect a USB keyboard to a PS/2 keyboard connection coming from a Black Box ServSwitch KVM. It didn't work, even after power cycling the KVM and the computers connected to it.Then I noticed on the adapter that there is an imprint of a mouse on the PS/2 end. So I suppose it is intended only for a PS/2 mouse connection (it IS green -- the color code for PS/2 mice, while PS/2 keyboard connections are generally purple). Anyway, the seller did not indicate this adapter was intended for a mouse connection and not a keyboard connection. If this adapter works for both, it certainly did not work with my PS/2 KVM.Other minor notes: the green plastic cover slips away from the USB side, and the PS/2 end was mis-aligned so the adapter had to be tilted before you could connect it."
5,An introduction to complexity for the intelligent reader,"Complexity is a new field that touches on almost every one of the sciences, and delivering a solid overview without being superficial is an exceedingingly difficult task; authors Coveny and Highfield have created a book that manages just that. They cover the physical, computational, biological and cognitive sciences, in each case with enough detail to really convey the essence of the field while still remaining very readable to the non-specialist reader. (There's a very detailed- and entertaining- annotated bibliography for those looking for more detail.)While there are currently a number of very good non-technical introductions to complexity theory by such skilled authors as John Casti, Mitchell Feigenbaum and others, this particular volume may well be the best of an excellent lot. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a a non-rigorous, but non-trivial, introduction to the field."
5,Rhyme for your pastime,"This is THE book for writers of rhymes who are anyone short of the likes of Cole Porter, one of the master of off-beat, intricate rhymes. This book is easy to use, presents good explanations (brief, to the point) in the short preface, and includes an excellent list with illustrations of pronunciation symbols. If you are like I---kinda embarrassed, reluctant, to have to depend on a reference book for your rhymes---be relaxed: Steve Sodheim and others of such find rhyming reputations have said in public that they do indeed use such references. This gem has 50,000 entries---no, I did not count them; I take the word of the cover info---and if you can't find a rhyme you need in that stack, you may be streaching too far to create your jingle. Enjoy!"
3,One Odd Sized Book,"It seems to have decent rhymes but the size is not easy to use. It is too thick for it's page size, however it is printed on decent paper."
1,Micro-Innovations is a poor product,This camera works ok in windows 2000 but does not work at all with XP. I feel ripped off and will never buy a Micro Innovations product ever again.
2,"Looks nice, but doesn't work well.","I had the unfortunate chance to use this camera whilst staying with a friend. The quality is poor, grainy, and though it tracks well, the picture is inconsistant. The software may as well have been written by a five year old for all the good it works with XP. I liked the look, but even with all the lights turned directly in your face the picture quality is poor at best. Spend your money on something better, this product is definately a waste of hard earned cash."
2,cool look - lousy image,"This webcam has a slick compact look. Unfortunatley, the fun ends there. The best image I could produce had a grey/green hue and was grainy. This cam is relatively inexpensive, which probably expains the poor image quality."
5,Sony Is A Good Brand,"I Heard Of This PDA In Circuit City. Everytime I Go There, I Practice Graffiti On The PDAs All The Time. When I Went There With My Mom, I Took A Picture Of Her With The Built-In Digital Camera That's Included On The PDA. I Heard About The Highest Resolution It Goes: 1,280 x 960 Pixels. When I Bring It With Me Everyday To School, I Can Take Pictures Of My Friends That Are Girls. I Also Heard This Has A Built-In MP3 Player. Then I Be Able To Listen To Music On This Thing. Then I Have Both iPod And Sony NX80V To Listen To Music To. But I Have To Store My Music On A Memory Stick. But The Memory Sticks Are Kind Of Expensive. But, I Still Can Afford The Memory Sticks In The Store. I Don't Know You Can Carry Around Your Neck If It's 8.0 Ounces."
5,"A sensitive, revealing look at the seamier side of tourism","Studs Terkel-style, Seabrook presents interviews, recorded and transcribed, with both sex workers and their mostly male clients in Bangkok, Thailand. This powerful volume peruses the commodification of sexuality, the sex trade, through the eyes and voices of the men who tramp the sex markets--the bars and brothels--and the women, men and children who service them. Also, addressed are a variety of related topics, including the global economy and developing countries, sociocultural costs of economic development, organized sex tours and agencies, human rights, children's rights, and HIV / AIDS. A highly readable travelogue, recommended for tourists, travel agents, and anyone interested in this controversial and sordid subject."
4,Sum of Its Parts,"My son has been asking for a Darth Maul figure to go with his 'new' Star Wars toys. ('New' meaning the toys I've kept since I was his age.) We searched all of the local stores and haven't been able to find one. Amazon to the rescue!This is a great figure. It is modeled after Darth Maul at the end of the fight from ""The Phantom Menace."" It does not come with a two-bladed light saber, but I made him one out of colored plastic rod and some electrical tape.SPOILER ALERT:****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************The model comes apart at the waist. It is held together with some very strong magnets.****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************END SPOILER:"
4,Up For The Count,"(Quoted from San Jose Mercury News Reporter: Brad Kava 8-21-02)""They are already in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a ""One Hit Wonder"". Three decades after their last climb up the charts, members of San Jose's legendary Count Five are trying to do it again! The 2002 version of the band sounds like these 1960's kids moved into the 1970's. The two songs sung by John Byrne have a Bad Company-like edge. They rock on ""White Powder"" while John sings of the dangers of cocaine. ""Hold My Soul"" has that psychadelic era frenzy, with a touch of Jim Morrison. The other songs are sung my newcomer Dorise Ataide who has a great sexy classic style of singing. A lot of the other songs have a vague Fleetwood Mac feel. It's classic rock at a time when people are craving just that."
2,Consider a flat tape,"The Shop Fox self-stick measuring tape I bought a couple years ago was not flat. It was slightly cupped like a tape measurer. It was tough, had a durable finish, and had a strong adhesive, but not strong enough to fully flatten the tape against the surface. I used one on the rail of my table saw fence, and a couple years of saw dust working its way under the edge made it come loose. I replaced it a few weeks ago with the Starrett 63169 Sm66w 3/4"" X 6' Starrett Measure Stix, but theStarrett Sm44w 1/2"" X 4' Starrett Measure Stixis closer to a direct substitute. The adhesive on the 3/4"" Starrett tape does not go all the way to the edge (Can't speak for the 1/2""), but the tape is flat. The flat tape seems to get less debris under it, so I expect it to stay in place longer. Only time will tell for sure."
2,dissatisfied,"The tape had only sticky on parts of the back, therefore we had to glue it to the saw. I would advise against this particular tape."
3,"Fantastic singer, mediocre material",Worth getting if you like the set of songs and aren't tired of hearing them again.The sound quality is excellent also.Too bad the material and arrangements are not in the same league as the singer.
2,Perhaps good for pre-pre-school children,"Too short to even bother reading to a child. The handful of pictures are ok, however the subject is neither covered well or with enough variety to keep even a chipmunk interested."
3,"Who Wants The College Student to Read This Book, Dad or Son?","If the problem is that your child doesn't like to read for pleasure, then you're not going to get that child to read this book and take the suggestions on what else to read. My copy is still in like-new condition."
2,thorough but biased,"Elaine's book is a thorough review of causes for this disease and some of the mainstream treatments for this disease. Her suggestion about self-care is helpful. However, her opinion is biased about RAI treatment that focused on some risks based assumptions or some selected personal stories instead of facts from large scale clinical trials. This bias might give patients a disillusion about the rate of successful remission without relapse with anti-thyroid medications which have been repeatly shown in many studies that only had modest efficacy (20-40%). The comment about the role of TSI in prediction of remission is over emphasized, which only has limited value in prediction while many other factors should be considered. Only relying on the knowledge from this book and using it as the only reference for treatment can be dangerous."
1,Thorough but disappointing,"Although this book does offer detailed information about Graves' Disease, it did not include information that I did not find in other excellent thyroid books. What I found particularly disappointing was that it promised real stories from real patients, but those storied were selected to present a very specific viewpoint. There were no stories from patients who had positive experiences with radioactive iodine treatment. (There was only one and that the patient found it beneficial was barely mentioned but the focus was that she had to have the treatment several times.)I had done a very unscientific study by posting on a public non-Graves BB just asking for peoples' experiences. I got a truly wide-range of opinions and quite a large number of people had positive experiences with RAI among other treatments. The bias view presented in this book prompted me to return it immediately. With such a confusing disease, I am really just looking for facts and unbiased opinions."
3,Perplexfully pleased...,"Interesting to a point, but way too technical for the average individual - like me. I was hoping for more straight talk and less medical gargin. Though, the diet information was very helpful, I found myself getting frustrated and bored with the medical terminology. I'm still looking for a book that concentrates on more natural ways to control my GD."
5,My Graves Bible,"This book is a must have for GD patients and their doctors. I refer to it constantly! Many thanks to Elaine Moore for writing it and for her tireless work in helping Graves patients everywhere!Looking forward to her book on Thyroid Eye Disease, coming out soon! (Spring/early summer 2003)"
2,Didn't care for this book....,I didn't care for this book I had a hard time with all the medical jargon and it was just a hard read for me.
3,Interested in the nitty-gritty technical details?,Excellent information. Extremely technical. Not easy to read and understand for the lay person.
3,"Too deep, for a newby.","I was hoping that this book would be more basic in the approach to faith development, but it read like a thesis. He interacted with many of the leading voices, but I was too new to this study to engage completely. There are some helpful elements, but unless you are well versed in this field, the book will be over your head."
3,Does not hold door snug,"The ball on this catch projects out from the surface of the catch about 1/8 inch, which is inadequate. The ball projects out of a threaded cylinder. The cylinder can be adjusted using a couple of small screw drivers. There is no mention of this essential feature on the package and it wasn't obvious to me.We have a much older closet catch that uses a nylon bolt that tapers on 2 sides. It works much better - if you can find one."
1,range unacceptable,Maybe OK for around house but barely works 1/2 mile from radio to radio. OK for around the house but we have trees and whatever else seems to block the transmission. We live in central Mississippi. I understand their test for 10 miles is in the desert where it is flat. No rolling terrain which doesn't roll that much in Mississippi.
2,Ten miles. Are those dog miles?,"We live on 105 acres, so the furthest we can get from the house is about half a mile. There's no more than a 40 foot difference in elevation from the house to anywhere on the land. These little guys work on about 1/3 of our property."
2,don't try on cruise,we got 2 sets of these at ubermart and tried them out first. they didn't make it past 2 miles in an area by a lake with little residential.
4,very good radios,"These are almost perfect for me at work. I work outside in the warehouse and in an adjacent building. They allow me to communicate with the office without the phone. The only thing Ive noticed is that they dont maintain full power for an eight hour day when left on. Still they are nice and loud, have good range and are easy to handle and charge. Sometimes if they are shut off and turned on again, they seem to regain some power."
2,not happy,The battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only- I am very disappointed in the quality. We need them for emergencies throughout the day- this is a farmed animal sanctuary- non-profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already. I am willing to change my review if we get new batteries.
2,pitiful battery life,"the batteries don't last long at all. if you send new batteries i will edit my review. until then, the product is rather worthless"
3,"Great radios, not as good batteries","I bought these radios for work inside a building and across a mile radius. Like any other review of Uniden radios, their projected range is not correct, maybe in an open field. These radios were bought to supplement other Uniden radios. Well low and behold, the batteries don't last as long over an 8 hour day. I found out that the new radios had batteries that were 550mAh, as opposed to the existing ones which had 700mAh batteries that last more than 8 hours. 700mAh batteries cost $15-20 or more depending where you get them."
2,Poor battery life,"After using these radios two months I can say that battery life is poor.A full charge doesn't hold three hours.Perhaps my batteries didn't come in good condition. I didn't use them on AAA yet... 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment, open sea or desert perhaps.Product works fine while battery last"
3,Don't Stay Charged Up Very Long,"I bought these, as we live in a large home, and they don't hold a charge even just through the daytime hours. Good sound though, if you don't need to use them all the time."
1,Not 10 mile radius as advertised,"The unit can only connect for a distance of up to just less than a mile. I bought two pairs of this item and I'm so frustrated that the first time I used and tried them, it couldn't able to connect after a distance of just half a mile.This is a ripoff."
1,Good game but dame too much buggy,"i like the game but after trying install patches and patches it doesnt work keep getting crash when enter to a battle. Total War support forum wasnt helpful at all. Im mad spend money on it and it doeent work for me, but it work for some ppl dont noe why"
1,SecuRom 7 buyer beware!,"I purchased this expansion when it first came out and couldn't stop playing it. I'm in the process of tracking down which of my games have SecuRom hiding in them. This nasty little trojan doesn't remove itself from your system when you uninstall the game. Well, this has the nastiest version hiding in it. Too bad, I really liked this game. I hope ETW ships without SecuRom hiding in it. I'll have to ""Spore"" that one too if it does. At least plain MTW2 shipped without it."
5,Awesome Sequel to an Awesome game,"Medieval II Total War taken to the next level.... In many ways it is more of the same, but thats not a bad thing in this case.... The only downside is the the Head to Head mode was a rather poor idea and is poorly implemented... but thats ok, it doesn't hurt the game which overall is just plain solid...Works like a charm of my Mac OS X Leopard Macbook Pro... I run it faster than all my PC friends on my Mac... HA!"
1,Be Aware,"I have been a loyal fan of TW since Shogun but I doubt I will buy another. This XP will install securom onto your PC without your permission and unless you are very computer savy you will not be able to remove it. Securom is known to conflict with many other programs (including other anti-piracy programs ironically enough). The only way we can fight this nonsense is to ""vote with our wallets"" and not purchase games that employ such tactics.At the very least, SEGA should clearly state on the box what is installed on your PC when you install the game and the consequences of that action. Then you as the buyer would be able to make an educated decision about whether you still wanted to purchase it."
5,great info,Shows you everything you need to know to load safely. Has every rifle and pistol caliber i was looking for and more
3,"Great film, terrible DVD","The movie itself is fantastic.The DVD quality is pretty poor. I get the impression that the absolute minimum amount of effort went into putting the DVD together. Picture and sound quality could do with cleaning up a lot, there are no special features (unless you count a page of text).In short I recommend buying this DVD to anyone who likes the film, but don't expect DVD quality."
1,Not Worthy,"I didn't even finish the movie. It was like a kung fu movie...just a different locale. Well, the kung fu movie was more enjoyable.The wannabe badguy, the inept enforcers...argh! It was too much to continue watching.It is nothing like the Trinity series; they are the best! The video quality is better than Boot Hill by far."
1,Unbeliveable,"This has got to be the worst movie that I have ever seen. Cheep quality, low budget, moronic plot, crummy acting, improvised script ( if it even had one ), but it did have Terence Hill & Bud Spencer. I would skip this one until some day when it was the only movie left in the world. It is realy bad."
3,Mad only about the music!,"Ok, the music didn't really anger me but it did get anoying after a while. For all those that are familiar w/ the Terrence Hill and Bud Spencer line of movies its not anything you couldn't stomach and for the most part laugh at. For those that are new to this particular genre of slap stick comedy, you should probably start off w/ a Trinity movie or two before you work your way up to this one. The overall quality of this transfer to DVD is good, but you'll have to adjust the volume at various points in the movie. ""Two Men, One Dune Buggy, and a Mob Boss who stands between them."" Good clean fun!"
5,"""Watch Out We're Mad"" with Terrence Hill & Bud Spencer","I was glad to find this film for my husband. He has always liked the ""My Name Is Nobody"" series of movies so when I found this one I had to get it to see if he would like it. I am not good at writing reviews unless I have a passion for the thing that I am writing about. All I know is it has the same kind of humor as the other Terrence Hill movies and it made my husband laugh. Great movie.The service was great we got the movie in real good time and in excellent shape."
2,Big Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of the ""Trinity"" movies by these guys and after reading the online reviews I thought this might be a fun gift for my husband. Whoops...big mistake, we both found the movie boring and the humor rather silly. Two thumbs down."
3,So-So,"A simple overview of Voudou for the curious. There is one notable exception. Within the first few pages, Ms. Turlington (or Mr. as Shannon is both a man and woman's name) shows a picture of a practitioner at home with his three tiered altar all decorated up and reading his Bible. Then on the next page, the author mentions that anyone can set up a Voodoo Altar (which is true) however it is best to have an initiated Houngan or Manbo set it up for you or at the least have one of them bless it for you. That is very worthwhile advice!I also noticed that the author is either an author or co-author of at least a dozen books on various subjects. Most of which are computer related. Makes me wonder if s/he is just another hack writer eke-ing out a living......???"
2,Not so good,"Despite earning 2 stars for containing the very best recordings of 'Bela Lugose' and 'XRay Eyes' out there, the rest of the tracks were never the best live takes they could've chosen. Bauhaus were a good live band but that simply doesn't come through on this album. On most of the songs Peter Murphy sounds like he is out of breath as he keeps cutting words short. The bonus tracks though are simply the worst. They sound like an undiscernable wall of noise, and then 'Waiting for My Man' is the finale of terribleness, as Peter's and Lou Reed's voices don't jel in any way whatsoever. It is ruined by the feeling that they are both singing blindly over the top of each other. Sigh. But it has some very high moments at least, worth buying for the few good recordings if you find this album cheapDaniel Thorlby bnP"
2,interesting.....,"this book was very interesting to read, to tell the truth i have not yet finished it yet...which is very weird of me because i usualy read a new book in a matter of hours the same day i bought it. I am finding the novel to be slow. But it has high parts and is action packed.....sometimes. Unfortunetly, that doesn'y make up for the fact that half the time i don't know what is going because the characters will switch so abruptly and the setting is sometimes hard to follow/understand. it kind of frightens me to think that this book will soon become a series, because frankly (sorry Catherine Jinks) this book is boring. the begining was funny and understandable enough, but too bad the rest of the novel just isn't like that."
5,So Far So Good,"The SD card was sent promptly and well packaged (in an adult proof plastic encasement!) Time will tell how reliable that it is, but so far so good."
1,Totally not worth it.,So I'm really not that hard to please when it comes to movies. And I have lots of LDS inspired dvd's but this one was really really not the best - like the worst one I have ever purchased. Rent it somewhere if you really are interested but I seriously would not recommend purchasing this.
1,80 minutes lost,"Just watched this movie with my husband of 19 years, and my daugther who's 14, and I must say, we tried so hard to understand......As contrary to the above reviews, the conversations and interactions were absurdely false and superficial. Also, they were SO negative overall about marriage until a tiny little reference at the end. We spent most of the movie at the edge of our seats waiting for it to develop a plot....it never came. I want my 80 minutes back."
3,Missed opportunity,"A large collection of movie clips, the series uses the same clips over and over again in the segments, some times the segments have no relevance to the monologue, some even date from the sixties. Its sloppy and inaccurate."
2,Loses what makes them so good,"These remixes are a mixed bag, and overall, a disappointment to those like me who rate Bowery Electric at the height of their genre (much better than, say, Massive Attack) for their uncanny intuitive spot-on ability to find perfect real (almost hybrid sexual and meditative) grooves. Basically these tracks take those grooves and add on what really is so annoying about most others in the field, namely the typical pitfalls of drum and bass: loud artificial drum machines and casio-like atmospherics. Even the good tracks like ""Empty Words"" suffer.If you're a fan of the genre in general, this is nice double-cd to pick up. There are enough interesting moments and ideas and a few wonderful tracks to make the modest price well worth it. Would I put this on when I have company? Never. Definitely not in the same class as ""Lushlife"" or ""Beat."""
2,WHooooo! holy sidecar!,"this album is great! I'd buy it for your grandma and aunt. the textures are real, and heartfelt doom abounds. listen with a can of beans in the room, and watch the sparks fly! astral hit!"
2,"Mediocre presentation, frozen in time","Poor artwork, mediocre animations. Looks like it was made 8 years ago. Could have been made better. Dorling Kindersley's Human Body is a better buy anyday."
4,Divine Providence,"Besides the deep explanation about the best and honest ways to be in connection with God, in this book I found the most insightful explanations about the Divine Providence and the way it works. In some parts what I was reading was like small episodes of my own living experiences that I have had during some times in muy life and were kind of amazing episodes. I am mexican and live in Mexico so I decided to make a transtation of the Divine Providence chapter because I have not found a spanish version of this book. I want that to be read by my family and friends. They will see life in a different context."
5,Rest Stop: The Collection,"I had seen the first Rest Stop and had no idea that there was a part 2. I enjoyed both of the movies and found that they both was very entertaining.The seller sent it in a timely fashion. I was pleasantly surprised in the good condition that it was in and for it coming to me so quickly. For the moveie to be used, I was very happy with seller and moveie. I give the movie 5 stars and the seller 5 stars.I truly recommend this movie and seller.Thank you,~Tonja~"
2,Annoying Beyond Belief,The Rest Stop film series is one of the most pointless and annoying ones too be released in ages. These two films are confusing beyond belief and make no real sense at all. The characters appear to exist only to be tortured and killed. This is really nothing but an attempt by filmmakers with no clue about the horror genre to jump on the torture porn bandwagon.
2,Terrible printing and paper,"The text looks like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of something printed a long time ago using small fonts. It is also printed on very thin, cheap paper, so the material printed on the other side of each page, as well as the the printing on the adjacent pages show right through. The book also uses variant fonts instead of classical Sanskrit fonts. All of this makes this book a poor product and a real hassle to use."
3,sanskrit dictionary,"only for scholars, very comprehensive, print extremely small, buy a magnifier to go with this dictionary"
5,Too Hot for Snakes-A Premier Live Album,"Too Hot for Snakes is a unique live album by a unique band. Some of the same songs are on Medicine Show(another great album)with several new,edgy songs. This album is done in much the same style as many Jerry Jeff live albums,with a more rockn' twist. This album has many good story-songs and several good,fast guitar solos(my personal favorite being on Give the World a Spin). I strongly recomend this album to anyone looking for a different flare of music that doesn't fit into any one catagory completely."
5,Looks beautiful!,"This fixture looks beautiful in my kitchen, and the price was better than right! Thank you!"
3,It helped quite a bit.,"I'm sorry that the mailing took longer than it was suppose to. They refunded me the money on time, that was spent for expediting the package, that ended up taking too long to arrive."
1,no review on this book!,A book that can be use without paying for high price preparation class for civil service exam. I need to know that this book can be use as a self help tool to someone who wants to pass the civil service exam.
1,A big disappointment,"The songs on this album have a pseudo-disco nature to them that take away from the raw and serious nature of Chris Rea's other works. I was expecting some memorable, moving songs, but I would rather forget this album. Truth be told, I never made it through the whole thing as I found every song I did listen to fatuous and artificial. I just could not make myself go on. This album is a big disappointment."
4,"Great introduction...best on Division 1, but still strong on Div. 2","This is a superb introduction to Heidegger...particularly to his magnum opus, _Being and Time_.Ignore whoever is still operating under ""analytic"" / ""continental"" categories...it's a silly critique and doesn't have much substance. Polt's book is superb, particularly on Division 1 of H's _B&T;_. It is a bit weaker on Division 2 of B&T; (I suggest supplementing with Gelven...who is a bit weak on Division 1).I think in the coming years this book will be invaluable as it gives the reader a key to unlocking Heidegger."
1,For analytically minded readers,"Richard Polt's little book joins a growing array of little books promising to ""introduce"" Heidegger and adds to a sadly growing list of ""analytic-style"" readings.One caveat: if one is able to read Heidegger on one's own, this book will do more harm than good. If one is not quite up to the challenge of reading Heidegger, this book will not help."
4,Horse lovers dream,How My child loved this book. She is a fast reader and finished this book in 2 days. She loved it and was ready to read the next book in the series.
4,a tribute that doesn't suck!,"while gary numan certainly had his place in my coming of age, i was never one of his rabid fans. perhaps that's why i find this tribute so refreshing and fun.saint etienne's ""stormtrooper in drag"" is worth the price of admission alone. this is the happiest dance song i've heard in a very long time. the chorus is infectious. you'll be humming it for days.towering inferno's ""metal"" has a certain ethereal shoegazing quality and borderlines on experimental. it's painful and lush.dubstar's ""everyday i die"" is pure jangle manna. heartbreak never felt so delicious.dave clarke's ironic ""cars"" cover (essentially a remix of the original) brings the compliation full circle to the present, offering gary his 15 minutes of retro-fame in all it's overproduced glory.like all tributes, this one is filled with its share of duds. biggest disappointment is no cover of ""cry, the clock said,"" my fav numan track. overall, though, i recommend this to numan purists and the curious alike."
5,even stronger,"Hey, I'm a die-hard Numan fan. I always found that his poetry outstrips his music by miles. Somehow many of these covers reveal the desperate longing, the awful alienation and the feelings of worthlessness that are intrinsic to Gary's early works. I listen to both ""Random"" CDs over and over. I grew up with Gary, working the streets for drugs, questioning my sexuality and reality of emotions. Here is all the anger and disillusionment that he sang lay bare for another generation."
4,Great stuff!,"I must confess to being a massive Numan fan in my teens.Now I've grown up, (well almost), I bought this album out curiosity, and I must say it has been one of the most pleasant surprises of this year.If you're a Numan fan (or even if you aren't) go out and get it and put a smile on your face ..."
2,VERY mixed offering.,"2 discs of covers, most of which really don't work. Stick to Numan's originals unless it's cheap and / or you are a total collector of ALL things Numan. Strictly AVERAGE on all levels. Some of the sound quality is awful too."
4,"A good listen, if you can't get the real thing","I found this CD during a drought of Numan material, and found it to be quite entertaining. The banjos on 'I Die: You Die' alone are almost worth the price of the CD."
2,WORTHWHILE,"As slasher flicks go, this one wasn't that bad. The only obvious negative is the killer/creature. It too closely resembled Swamp Thing and the outfit was too silly. But the story was good and entertaining.The acting was professional. The sheriff was a characature. How did all of the killer's victims disturb the land? Why was he killing everyone and why did he not kill the young lady at the end. The actual murders were a bit overdone. Gore does not necessarily equal quality storytelling. There is something missing to the plot. The relationship between the blossoming teens did not develop enough before he became hamburger helper. This movie was worth what I paid for it, but not much more."
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL.,Sterling is more like tarnished brass. This is the worst I have heard in pop music in a long time. Don't even bother.
3,Good for the price,"I bought this as I didn't want to spend 100-plus on other models as I rarely do crown. Definitely makes coping easier, though mine was a bit warped-I'd worry about it in the hot sun....Also it is easily cut, which you will do sooner or later. I'm satisfied for the price but if I did only finish carpentry I would definitelyshell out the bucks for a nicer one."
2,not worth it for small projects or smaller size moulding.,They don't tell you that you need to secure the easycoper to some sort of stand. It can't be done freehand. I was looking for something quicker.
4,Still waiting to use mine,The project I bought this for is delayed so I have not used mine yet but the online videos make it seem simple to use.
4,Good quality binder,"My kids use multiples of these every year for school. Quite a few others have fallen apart in a couple months and or they complain the rings either won't open properly or won't close all the way. Weve ordered this same binder in lots of colors and the kids report that they all work great. I still have to replace them a couple times a year, but not as often as the others. But I also see my sons jamming spiral notebooks into the front pockets and cramming the binders into their backpacks not to gently, so I imagine they aren't exactly careful with them either. We will definitely be buying more."
4,Perfect for indoor cats,I started buying these from PETCO for my indoor cat because she was constantly clawing the couch. I bought the ones from Amazon because I wanted to have a little fun with the colors and because they sell out too quickly in stores. I thought we would have a hard time putting/keeping them on the cat but she actually enjoyed the attention of us holding her. They are seemingly painless based on my cat's reaction.
3,awesome if your cat will keep them on,"I got these for my cat, and they are super cute. However.. she finally learned she could chew them off, so within 24-38 hours of putting them on, she chews them off."
4,"Good Product, Bad Cat","I thought that the Softpaws were great, and they seemed to work with my cat for about a week until she found out that she could pull them off if she tried hard enough. The only last her for about 3 weeks, but I don't think it was the product. I have seen other cats who don't try to pull them off, and the softpaws stay on for a while."
4,Good product,Soft claws arrived quicky and as promised. I probably would have done better with the mediums. My kitten is 7 months old. Just be sure not to cut the nails too short or the caps won't stay on. Soft claws really help when you have a cat that likes to scratch and you don't want to declaw.
2,let down,"I have ordered Soft Claws from the retailer before and they have worked fine, lasting about a month. However the ones I ordered here on Amazon did not work well. They would not stay on and all had come off after only a few hours. I don't know if the glue was bad/old, but they were not efficient at all. NOT SATISFIED."
5,Just as Hoped For + Application Tip,"Decided to try these as one of my many cats seemd to have an agressive streak, and she would sometimes hit one of the other cats in the eye area, causing the eye to be inflamed. After nearly 3 weeks, they are still on and have prevented her from scratching the other cats - and her pink 'toes' look so cute. She doesn't seem to mind them at all.I used a ""Klaw Control"" bag for the application process. You just enclose the cat into the bag, and can open various zippers to access one paw (or other parts of the body) at a time."
2,Not so much,"I bought these for a cat we adopted and while they stayed on, she was still able to pull loops up on carpet! We rent and our landlord was very specific about the carpets. Our other cat was declawed, and I'm pleased to say, NEVER once has bitten us or turned into a mean, nasty cat. I don't think she realizes she has no claws 8 years later! So, we took our new cat and had her declawed using a laser. She has no clue that anything occurred and seems fine! Soft paws are not an alternative. They are useless. Think what you want of me, but I love my animals and I am not a cruel person. Also, there are more cats with claws in the shelters I went to than without. Why is that, I wonder!"
3,Worked great at first....,"These worked great at first. My cat was scratching the frame of our door and I don't believe in de-clawing, so thought these would be a great alternative. The first time I put them on they lasted for about two weeks, then started to fall off. Every time I replaced one, my cat would meow like crazy like I was hurting her. The next day, I would find them on the floor after she chewed them off. She also walked funny with them on, and you could hear the ""click, click"" of the caps hitting the floor. One of the caps stayed on and actually pulled some of her fur out because it stuck to the glue, so I had to cut it off with clippers. I've tried several different brands, but have the same result. I've stopped using them, but every time I go to clip my cat's nails she meows thinking I'm going to put them on her again. If your cat is tolerant of them, they're a great investment. But most cats are as stubborn as mine and won't like them."
5,Safe alternative to De-clawing,"After being convinced not to declaw my kitten by my neighbor, I looked these up from her recommendation. So far, after my kitten having them on for a little over a week I have to say they are great. Keeps my kitten from scratching up all the furniture and climbing all over everything. It took her a few days to get used to not being able to use her front claws anymore. As far as putting them on, it was a little tricky by myself but would be easier with a second person to hold the cat. I haven't seen any negative side effects other than a little frustration (and some amusement for me) occasionally when my kitten slips off the top of the couch."
1,Mission Impossible!,"My wife being a cat lover insisted that to spare the cost of de-clawing and to save our furniture we needed to get these for our two kittens. I gave these 1 start because although we were able to get them put on one willing kitten, we quickly discovered that behaviorally it affected him more than not having them. These are not very easy to put on or take off for that matter. We took these off as soon as we could and invested in some scratching posts and are being proactive in trimming their claws. Works much better."
1,Belkin: Larger than a Palm closed & smaller when it's open!,"A keyboard that's too big to be considered ""mini"" and too small to be comfortable. It's strange left-side cradle design accompanies it's cheap toy-like feel. Don't be deceived by its full sized apperance, this keyboard does not allow free flow typing at any reasonable speed. I highly recommend Palm Brand Portable Keyboards. The Palm Brand Portable Keyboard worked great with my Palm V. The two biggest problems I've seen with friends and collegues purchasing palm keyboards that are not made by palm are 1.) functionality and 2.) a connection mis-match. A friend who recently purchased a Belkin Keyboard could not even get the software loaded correctly. Every button he pressed on the keyboard forced his palm pilot into Hot Sync. Haven't heard any complaints personally about Palm Inc. Keyboards. Be sure that whatever keyboard you go with specifies that it is compatible with your model, and don't trust the pictures!"
1,"Weak Connector, again","First I tried it at the store with an opened box model. There was a screw missing which held the connector in place. It was found elsewhere, loose from where it should have held the connector in place.So the clerk got me a new one. I took it home and the small connector unit came loose. It appears the two screws that held the connector in were not screwed in completely. two different widgets, same conceptual problem.Quality control appears to be an issue."
1,Not in stock!,"I was eager to try this product which showed as being in stock. When I checked out, however, I am told it is NOT in stock. Quite irritating."
3,Great product/price - BUT NOT IN STOCK,This is a great value - if you can get it. It shows as in stock on the amazon.com product detail page but the items are not available to purchase when you proceed with an attempted purchase. 5 stars for the product/price but 0 stars for showing in stock when it's not!
4,Good product for healthy kitties :o),"I bought these caps for my cat because she has skin issues. She pulls out her fur and I figured this would help her out. I puncture a small hole in the capsule with a safety pin and let it drip on her dry kibble once a day. It smells really fishy which is very appealing to my cat. When I bring out the bottle, I shake it a bit and she comes running for it. She picks out the kibble that has the fishy oil on it. She loves it! I have noticed a slight difference so far. I haven't been using it long so I can't say if it will make an even better improvement on her skin. I have read really good things about this oil so I bought it :) The best for my babies!"
3,Color Matters!!,I bought two different styles of this ring.I have to admit that The Only Disappointment was in the color.The Blue is Not That Blue and does Fade...
2,Parts of this product are poor quality & the seller's return policy is even worse,"I really like this shopping cart bag EXCEPT that the zipper that holds this bag together (when not in use) broke after 2 uses. Since the 2nd use happened after the end of the 30 day return policy AND since I had already used the product (of course I did! how else would it break?) the seller would not accept a return. BabyAge was the seller I purchased through on Amazon and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM. The product of course also was at fault so I also contacted BuggyBagg and after a couple voicemails & emails to them, I did not receive a return call or return email."
3,"meh, just ok","the most irritating thing about this mat is its permanent crease. upon further examination, you can even see it clearly in the photos on the product page. it has a persistent hump in the center, which sort of defeats the purpose of this item and makes it much more difficult to work with dough.the ruler and circles are nice, but the mat (as mentioned in other reviews) does need to be floured every time, and since the hump won't go away, it makes it difficult to keep the central portion of your dough from sticking to the mat because the flour falls off to the sides.mat is also extremely easy to cut, as i realized the first time i used it with a dull dough knife. oops.save your bucks, the counter is far easier to clean. recipes are nice but surely not worth the investment."
2,it's not non-stick!,I bought this and the silicone rolling pin and my dough stuck to both of them!... (and I used plenty of flour)... I was very disappointed... I'm going back to my wooden rolling pin and wooden butcher block to roll my crusts... and wish I had not bought them online because it's a hassle (and a charge) to return them...
2,"Okay, but go for an alternaitve","I bought this product instead of the Roul'Pat and it was a mistake. I thought the circles were cool and maybe helpful for baking, but I'd rather have a product that sealed to the counter better and wasn't so heavy. There's a seam down the middle (you can even see it on the product image if you look really close) that is super annoying considering you're using it to roll baked goods flat. It does keep dough from sticking to the counter, but not as well as other products."
5,Does its job!,"First of all, you want a surge protector that has metal protection on it, since I have seen plastic ones go up in flames. It is kind of big, but has enough outlets as well as a nice styling to it."
5,Long narrow surge protector needed!,"I needed a long narrow surge protector for a very small working area. Surge protector offers plenty of plug space, works great and is made to last."
3,Good for college students,"This is a well-presented, readable guide. However, it is lacking in background information--which we found more of in Explore Puerto Rico and the drier Lonely Planet guide. It is good as a supplement. However, I would use Explore Puerto Rico or one of the other guides as my main guide. What we found really useful was all of the websites and e-mails that are listed in depth in Explore Puerto Rico. This really helped us plan our trip. Let's Go guides are written by Harvard college students and the tone and content reflect this."
4,Useful and interesting,"I used this edition of Let's Go for 2 separate trips to Puerto Rico and was very happy with it. I thought it contained a good amount of background and history of the island, as well as pointing out interesting, non-touristy places to go and things to do. It has a lively, engaging tone and is never dry or boring. I enjoyed just reading it to learn about Puerto Rico, aside from using it as a guide to the island.A more recent edition has been published, so therefore not all of the info in this edition is totally up to date (but of course, it is impossible to have a totally up-to-date travel book because by the time these books are published, some things will inevitably have changed). But in my opinion it would be worth having along just to read about Puerto Rico and get suggestions for off-the-beaten-path things to do."
2,larry burrows vietnam,"I was waiting adamantly for this item for about two weeks, just past the prescribed postal order. The item was suppose to be in good condition, but the binding inside the cover is cracked the whole way down front and back with a few stains on the pages. It said some ware on the dust jacket from shelf use, but didn't reveal the amount of use as it was previously a library book, so I'm sure hundreds of more hands had their chance to turn the pages also. I would like a replacement, because of faulty advertising."
3,Real stories of war,"This book is good. I liked it. I like war books and movies because action is cool! The guns were the old kinds, like M60 machine guns. It was very bloody and contained torture, which seemed very real to me in a gruesome kind of way.I recommend this book to people who like war stories because it tells the truth about war."
3,Good summary of themes in current Anthropology,"If you aren't aware of the current themes of debate in current Anthropology, this book will give you a good summary. It covers most of the current debates and methods of Anthropology.If you are looking for something that explains the actual theories being used today, this is not the book to read. As a graduate student in Anthropology, this book was a let down. I was expecting new, original theories, but got a series of themes for debate. A history of Anth theory like Alan Barnard's History and Theory in Anthropology or a compilation like J. Clifford & G. Marcus's Writing Culture are more along the lines of what I was expecting and wanting."
1,Large in size -- much of it fluff.,"Considering the size of this volume, it is amazingly devoid of substance or content. Althought the author has done a creditable job of collecting photos (mostly B&W), and reprinting vintage advertisements, no additional information, which might have added perspective or insight, is provided. How can you date a Parker Vacumatic? What years are indicated by three bands versus one? Which colors or model variations are most common or rarest? These are the types of information that would have made this book useful to both beginning and experienced collectors. Unfortunately, the author provides none of this, and what results is a virtually useless hodgepodge of recycled advertisements."
2,Good for 1988 Prices Only!,"Unlike most books on this subect, this edition has very few color photos and print quality is that of a copy machine. Its only redeming quality is its price listings that are already three years old."
4,Useful as a guide as to what is collectable and what is not.,"I find this book to be very helpful as one of serveral reference books for buying and selling pens. As with everything, you must learn to use information to your benefit. More color pictures would be nice."
5,Excellent and exactly as seller described.,This is an out of print book which is perfect for a collector. It adds to the knowledge base and helps when evaluating to buy the old writing devices.
4,Escellent reference source,Excellent reference source for the beginning/intermediate collector. Good value.
2,"GREAT HISTORY OF PEN COMPANIES ,BUT WEAK IN ORGANIZATION.","GREAT HISTORY OF FOUR PEN COMPANIES AND THEIR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS. I FIND THE BOOK TO BE DIFFICULT IN TRYING TO FIND THE PRICE . PRICES ARE LISTED IN ABOUT FIVE DIFFERENT PLACES THROUGH OUT THE BOOK, SOME LISTED AFTER THE COMPANY SECTION. SOME BY PAGE, NOT NAME. THE COLOR SECTION IS BEAUTIFUL, BUT TRY TO FIND THE MANUFACTURE AND THE PRICE GUIDE--- IT TAKES ALOT OF FLIP-FLOPPIN' BACK AND FORWARD TO FIND ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED. ALOT OF OVER KILL ON ALL THOSE ""OLD"" ADDS. FROM A CONKLIN TO A EPENCO I RATE THIS A 66."
5,No regrets owning this CD,"The only possible regret you could have with CD is that there isn't more of it. This is real country music of the best kind. It has the purity and simpleness of traditional country along with a unique style all its own. There's a wide variety of sound and emotion here. It goes from the sad and almost mournful ""Well of Tears"" to the wickedly funny ""Life of Regret"". In four songs you only get a good taste of the full range of the talent that is Kelly Kessler and the Wichata Shut-ins featuting Lawrence Peters. But what a taste it is!"
4,A vivid grab bag of a collection,"This appears to be a collection of Supraphon recordings which means while they are not of the greatest sound quality, they are well conducted and well played. The l933 Bartered Bride production (also on Naxos) is well conducted though not especially well sung; the later Dalibor is quite marvelous, probably the best performance in Czech. The quartets and piano trio are well played, as is the (generally unknown) piano music. As, for that matter, are the lesser known orchestral pieces. Ma Vlast, the one well known orchestral piece, is played in a superb l941 performance led by the great Vaclav Talich (one of the unexpected pleasures of the Prague National Theater (the national opera) is a statue to Talich with an inscription to the effect that ""he saved the orchestra"" (i.e. he kept it together with integrity under both the Nazis and the Communists). So given its price, this is a fine set."
4,You will be successful on the exam with this book,"This book is well written, and easy to read. It covers the material on the 70-294 exam with sufficient depth and breath for you to be successful. Active Directory is the heart of Windows Server 2003, and you will not be successful on the test or in the real world without mastering the material in this book and on the exam. The book is one of a series of Syngress books that the Shinders have written that cover the entire range of MCSE 2003 exams. I recommend all of those books, and they are, in fact, the books that I used to successfully pass all of the MCSE 2003 tests. The only part of the book that I don't think is very good is not the book itself, but the accompanying DVD, which in my opinion, is pretty much worthless."
4,Well-produced British pop-rock in the 10cc/David Essex vein.,"TENNIS is easily the most diverse album of Chris Rea's career, combining the urban post- punk paranoia of the early '80s (the title cut) as well as breezy AM-style pop perfect for car cruisiing (""Dancing Girls""). This album was not promoted strongly by CBS when released, msking any copies of it extremely hard to find. Fortunately, its release on CD (long overdue, I must say) means true fans of this terrific artist can discover where the influences of later works (THE ROAD TO HELL, NEW LIGHT THROUGH OLD WINDOWS) came from. This is a must for any collector of British pop- rock."
3,Tennis CD,"This wasn't what I expected, but this was really my fault. The person who told me to order this meant for me to get the CD by the group Tennis."
5,small excellent quality TV speakers,My new HDTV had poor performance speakers. I disconnected the speakers and externallywired in a pair of Pyle Home PCB4BK 4Inch 200 Watt Mini Cube Bookshelf Speakers. Thesound is great. These speakers are small enough to be positioned in the space betweenthe TV base stand and the bottom of my TV. They are not obvious as being add-on speakers.
3,Mounting,"Good question here, how am I supposed to mount them. They have this funky thing that kinda pulls out. If I try to mount it just comes undone. I haven't heard them yet, because I can't get over the mounting hurdle. I will give the rating a three until I can get this answered.Ammended: I did figure out how to mount them by drilling into them. It works, but not the most ideal solution. They should have included standard mounting, how hard is it to have a predrilled screw hole or something? The good news is that they work pretty good in my 7.1 system."
2,Not so good,"One of the speakers was blown out upon delivery. Others had warned these didn't ship well. The one that worked sounded pretty good, seemed to deliver a full range and decent sound. Considering it seems to be a low end paper speaker (like what comes stock in many cheaper cars), I was impressed.I'm worried they won't last. Returning these and going for the Polk sattelites. Up towards $100 now, but they should stand the test of time."
2,Horrible sounding speakers... but read...,"I had the idea to use these speakers with my 200 watt Logitech speaker system, which I connect my ipod to at work. The original speakers were damaged and I tried these as replacements with the subwoofer. The sound is absolutely horrible. Cloudy and distorted. There is no treble or highs whatsoever, and the mid-bass is crazy loud. I believe the speakers are getting 25 watts per, which is considerably less than what theyre rated, so this probably contributes to the horrible performance. This is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because I am not quite using them right. But I cannot imagine them sounding very good in any situation. I put them in the trash and chalked it up as a loss. I bought a new logitch system, which has excellent sound with all the original components!"
3,small auxillary TV speakers,"These speakers are veryt nice,,,and I like the sound; however, they cannot be muted with the remote control as auxillary speakers, so they are of no use to me. I cannot watch TV without a remote control mute because the commercials suck."
2,Horrible Sound,"Don't buy these, they sound awful. Very tinny sound. I bought these because they were the perfect size, unfortunately, they don't function well."
1,Speakers received damaged - outer packaging OK,"When received, one of the two speakers had something really heavy rattling around inside the plastic enclosure, and did not work at all. The second one had what sounded like shards of plastic rattling around. The outer (Amazon) packaging was not damaged at all, so i conclude that the mounting of some heavy component inside the plastic cabinet is not very robust. I did get to play some classical music with the one functioning speaker, but, i wouldn't call it hi fi. It will serve the purpose, namely as a pair of under cabinet speakers in the kitchen for a Rocketfish wireless setup, but I certainly wouldn't bother to use these in my 5.1 surround setup. I asked for an exchange from Amazon, and will return the broken ones shortly, but, after reading similar experience reported by another reviewer, i am not too confident that the results will be much different. I should have read the reviews first, before ever ordering the product."
4,200-Watt Mini Cube,"Nice product for the price, just can't figure out how to get more sound out of them... Very heavy and well built a great addition to the speakers I already have."
2,Pyle Home PCB4BK 4-Inch 200-Watt Mini Cube,"well, let's just says i didn't expect much and that is exactly what i got. the speakers arrived on time and in good condition. them sound like they are in a deep well (it is almost frightening) you get what you pay for so next time i'll pay more for the polk audio rm7. they do play sound however scratchy and muffled it maybe"
2,Cheap little speakers,"Many of the other reviews are right on. I ignored them and bought them anyway because they were inexpensive. They are cheap costing but also poor sounding speakers. Low sound level and low fidelity output. I bought these for a home theater, but I'm trying to find something else now. Additionally, there are no mounting holes for for brackets etc. You get what you pay for."
2,"Okay, but not good","I'm not impressed. They are not bad, but have a really cheap, cheesy feel to them. The cases are flimsy plastic and the sound is unremarkable. I guess they work- sound does come out and they are small. If that is what you need, then they are okay."
5,Oddball - I Love It!,"The other reviews center on the diner language. That's all very well, but I like the quirky characters. Does anyone else perceive Frank and Ernest, especially Ernest, as the epitome of capable masculinity, like in movies from the 1940s? They are cool, they are witty, they ooze dignity and they are well-dressed! Where are real life men like Frank and Ernest!?"
5,One of the best books I've ever read,I liked this book A HOLE LOT!!! It's an easy reader book but it is interesting how they talk in such an odd language. When I was much younger every night I would read this book.
5,An excellent summary of the XKE in narrative and photos.,"This 200 page, 150 picture, 50 chart book is a great overview of the XK-E's produced from 1961 to 1974. A nice history of the company and the model, this allows the complete novice to talk intelligently with Jag lovers. It is possibly an inexpensive beginning to an E-Type love affair with attendant significant wallet hemorage."
5,One of the best books on Jaguar E-Type.,This book exceeded my expectations.Even though this book series are usually published in hardcover this title is published as a softcover.Its a comprehensive story on the E-Type with plenty of beautiful photographs throughout.Its thorughly researched.This book will please most people.An ideal and inexpensive book to add to your collection.
4,Book review,Great so far - have not finished it yet but looks good. Worth buying. Would probably recommend it to others
1,no copy protected CD's for me,"I like her, but wouldn't even consider purchasing a copy-protected CD. If you can't put it on a MP3 player of any sort, I have no use for carrying around a crapload of CD's. FFFFF SONY!"
1,The Copy protection is a malware and can be dangerous.,This installs rootkit which is malware that is used to hide and mask its existance. It installs itself in your computer and is almost impossible to remove. Attemps to remove it can damage ones computer. Great Music though!!
2,not the best,I have many of Lorie Line's cd'sthis is not my favoriteI would like to hear these songs without the vocals.
3,Not What I expected,"After reading the reviews for Circles in Time, I expected a very good romance. Not the case! It was more like The Adventures of Robin Hood instead of a romance. Except for the very beginning and the very end, the two main characters were not together much. Too much of lesser characters such as Robin Hood, and the irritatingly evil Sheriff of Nottingham. When I buy a romance, I want ROMANCE (not a book about some evil character trying to do everyone wrong). Enough already!Also, it's a bit of a wonder how Navarre and Kendra ever fell in love. He is stuck on calling her a witch and throws her in a dungeon. She is wishing she could go home. Then all of a sudden they are supposed to love one another--not believable.Luckily, the writing was good or else I would never have finished it."
1,Beware!,"I bought it for my Acura CL, which according to the Ipod2car's manual, the vehicle is fully compatible with it. Thats not the case as I found out after paying $100 in install fees that it wasn't. Called customer service and received the worst ""customer service"" ever as the guy kept yelling that the vehicle must not be compatible,...so why list it on the package ?????These people have ""techs"" who sound like they have never heard of the device at all..So do your research first about compatibility."
1,Beware!,"These adapters work for a few months, then just stop. I've been through 2 of them now, but no more! Look for other alternatives. You'll be sorry if you purchase this item."
2,Junk,"After my DLO Transpod FM modulator decided to quit working in stereo after 4 months (sound would only come out of the left speakers, $100 flushed down the toilet) I decided I wanted a direct interface for my iPod. Best Buy has this Peripheral unit on sale for $99 and I had a gift card, so I thought I would give it a shot.If I didn't have prior electronics experience, I couldn't have to done the installation. The instructions aren't just bad, they are non-existent. Literally, there are no pictures, and it pretty much says ""make the necessary connections"". I thought it was a joke.The unit worked well for about 2 weeks. Now, it randomly pauses the music, turns off the iPod, crackles, and even will cause my stereo to say ""XM ERROR"" and shut down completely. Of course now it is like 35 days since I bought it and now I can't return it. Save your money if you ask me."
1,Stay Away,Stay away from this company!!!!. They have a very poor customer service policy.After paying almost $200 for this interface it went bad. The manufacturer offered to replace it under the warranty for $70 plus shipping both ways for a grand total of over $100 for junk
1,FRIED MY IPOD~!,"BEWARE~!SIMPLY CONNECTING THIS PRODUCT, AS PER INSTRUCTIONS, FRIED MY IPOD, AND DRAINED MY CAR BATTERY!CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS NONEXISTENT!"
1,Boring,Perhaps if they interviewed an INTERESTING struggling comic this documentary might be a little more bearable.
2,Dave or unknown losers?,What was supposedly a Dave Chappelle dvd ends up being nothing to do with it and tells the story of the struggle of two up and coming comedians and their fight to fame. Would have been less misleading if Chappelle's name was not the title as he was only in it for two minutes. Disappointing
2,Long and wordy,"I plowed my way through this book, hoping it would improve. I am not stupid, but I never did understand why Simone left a wonderful man like Jamie, and I never did understand what made him so wonderful. Nor did I really understand why Jamie and Edward were estranged. Would somebody let me know these questions? I really thought Salah and Julian were somewhat shallow. I do not intend to try to find the sequel."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE PRIOR REVIEW CAME FROM. SHE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T READ THE SAME BOOK I DID. THIS BOOK WAS FABULOUS AND I COULDN'T STOP READING. I HAVE READ ALL OF THIS AUTHOR'S BOOKS AND I FEEL THAT EACH ONE JUST GETS BETTER! THE STORYLINES ALWAYS KEEP YOU MESMERIZED--THIS ONE WAS NO EXCEPTION. THE MAIN CHARACTER FIVE KILLER WAS VERY HEROIC. HE WAS ABLE TO SHOW THAT SOMETIMES LOVE IS NOT ALL THAT MATTERS. HIS LOVE FOR HER WAS SO STRONG THAT IN THE END HE WAS GLAD TO BE CAPTURED SO THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HANNAH AND HIS SON. HE WITHSTOOD A LOT OF TORTURE SO THAT SHE COULD BE FREE. PLEASE READ THIS AND ALL OF MS. REAVIS' BOOKS. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY. SHE IS A GREAT AUTHOR AND I KNOW THE NEXT BOOK WILL BE EVEN BETTER.
5,Strong Woman,The Captive Heart brings the reader to another place and time with poignant universal and timeless insights!
1,Not That Good,"This was the first book I have read by this author. The book was not to my liking at all. I found the characters quite dull and flat. The plot did not hold my instrest at all except to finish the book. The hero is one I would not consider a hero. Not only did he plan to use the heroine, but he abused her. Her situation is far fetched in my mind and her actions are stupid and boring. But, that is only my opinion. Feel free to read to book for yourself and come to your own conclusions."
3,order filled incorrectly,my only problem is that i got after shave colonge instead of after shave lotion which i ordered.
3,It's ok,"My first Panasonic vacuum was a dream, this one not so dreamy. It was actually put together incorrectly, then it arrived with a broken light and cover for the light was smashed into pieces. It's not clear as to how the belt goes on so you will go through one or two before figuring it out.I do like the idea of it not having bags but it doesn't do well at heavy jobs. I took it to work one day and it didn't hold up well at all. Small retail store with only normal foot traffic, it wasn't like I was trying to vacuum a construction site. It works well in my studio apartment other than it's too big and I can suck up dirt in the living area from the bathroom. : -)I still feel that Panasonic makes a good vacuum, just not this one."
1,don't waste your money,"This vaccuum was heavy and only lasted 5 months before becoming a hunk of junk. Terrible suction, bulky. Awful. The only good thing about it was the color!"
1,WHY?,This movie SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS! It is AWFUL! TERRIBLE! HORRIFIC!! STINKS!! The WORST!!! Why did I watch this? There goes 5 minutes of my life I will never get back!!!
5,Absolutely awesome,I use this book at least once a week. I especially love the wheat bread recipe..(my most used recipe in the book) Would reccomend. A+++
2,"Beautiful pics, debatable instructions...","I received this cookbook as a gift, and was amazed with its beautiful pictures. Unfortunately, of the three recipes I've tried (profiteroles, ginger cookies, and pizza dough), none came out right. I'm a regular baker so have adjusted them accordingly, but it's still disappointing when you can't trust the written recipe."
2,Translated from the original Korean?,"This is one of the worst textbooks I've had. It honestly reads like it was translated from Korean to German, and then to English. I have the concepts of Cognitive Psychology down pretty well, and I think this book actually caused me to lose some of it in the process of trying to wade through it."
1,Why Not To Read Fundamentals of Cognitive Psychology,"At this point in time I am reading ""Fundamentals of Cognitive Psychology"" for a class that I am currently attending. My class is wonderful, but this book is very dry. I understand that the subject of cognitive psychology involves a lot of research and data and all this information is important to the study of this subject, but this book is very dry and personally boring. The whole book is a review of past research and analyzations of the subject and the author gives no thought of his own to the subject. If I wanted to know every little detail of every cognitive experiment I would look that exact experiment up. There is no basis of the book and it does not help me in the least little bit in my studies. The content is very dry and not attention holding. I would definately look into something else as far as books go if I wanted something interesting!!!"
4,first impression: great bass solo,"Heard the title track on the car radio and was hooked. Most of the time I can not hear bass solos in my car, but this one comes thru. I must admit that I am writing mostly in reaction to the other Amazon customer reviews. Histrionics?! Moldy figs! Too much bass?! Yes, compared to our old Prestige recordings. BAH! Great job guys, keep them coming. PS Now that I have my own copy, I think it plays very nicely at home too."
5,"Excellent system, sounds fantastic!","I love this system! I've had it for about 6 months now and the sound is fabulous. The bass is deep and will shake the walls, and the speakers will blast crystal clear sound even when you turn the volume up to full blast.I read a ton of reviews on different sites that have claimed Bose is just over-hyped junk, but I can honestly say that for this price range, this is a quality system. I currently have the system hooked up to a Sony receiver that puts out 110 watts per channel, and it can get L O U D! When watching concert videos and movies, you feel like you're there.Obviously, someone looking to design a room totally dedicated to home theater use would go with a larger, more professional setup, but for typical living room style home entertainment, this system will do the trick."
2,Bose is all Hype,"I am ready to sell this for a $300 loss.The sound quality observed in the Bose store is extremely difficult to recreate at home and also they use custom created DVDs in the store.Setting up is a nuisance. Initially I thought I was unable to calibrate and setup properly, but later I brought home my friends HomeTheater(Denon and Onkyo combination) for testing . That gave a far better performance than Bose.I believe the correct price for this system is $500 based on performance and its competitors."
4,vatman,"Heavy duty packaging assured unit arrived in good condition. 1 Bose speaker mount casting failed. Neighbor had a spare and all is good. Speaker wiring is a bit hokey but once setup, it ROCKS. I've wanted this set-up for years. Got it. Well worth the wait."
5,Bose Price - But good quality!,Love this system.... I use it with my Onkyo 500 series 5.1 reciever and it looks & sounds very nice!
2,Okay,"This was a pretty good system. The bass was great. The surround sound is excellent. However, it is lacking in the upper frequencies. Voices sound flat, almost muffled. Violins and other instruments that have higher frequencies more in the treble range, sound the same because the speakers cannot play the full range of sounds. Online reviews and forums say that is because Bose used a cheaper paper inside the speaker."
2,"lots of advertising, big name, cheap sound","Bose cube speakers have a fundimental sound..the cubes contain a tiny speaker, essentially a tweeter, The subwoofer box contains a 5.5 inch woofer.. bass below 120 cycles is no directional, so the sub can be placed almost any where.. but the cubes only have a low frequency of 200 cucles leaving a big audio gap not covered..right in the middle of the speech range.....A 5.5 inch woofer can deliver low frequency when paired with a large amplifier.Usually 200 watts rms or more..Bose has never posted its amplifier power outputs...(top secret)If you play hiphop or rap and loud action moves the bose will sound fine...If you play true music look for a speaker with a minimum of a 4 inch woofer and a 8-10 inch subwoofer.(this eliminates the bose and sony cubes)..Yamaha, klipsch and onkyo still make some of the best systems and for not much more money"
4,why all the haters,Got these speakers to go with an onkyo 616. was shocked by the bad rep bose has for these speakers with mentions of the woofer being a 'midwoofer'. i couldnt be more pleased with the amount of bass the woofer produces and ive been a musician for 20 years. sure you can get equally good jamo or klipsch speakers for much cheaper but as far as satellite speakers go these deliver great sound for their size. annoying that the speaker mounts are not included though and they cost 30$ a piece.
5,great sound system,"Love my new sound system. Updated my basement family room with new sound system. Works great, great sound and balance. Easy to set up. Love it !!"
3,Bose Acoustimass 10 IV,"Sorry Bose, but I think your highly overrated. The is sound OK, their compact and do not distort and fairly loud. I replaced a pair of older Klipsch. Guess I got used to the good stuff."
4,Powerful words from often-neglected voices,"The best thing about this anthology of short stories is the real-world voice that it provides for teenagers who read it. So many teens can feel disenfranchised by the American perspectives on opportunity, and this book shows a very valuable multicultural and immigrant perspective. I teach creative writing in a high school program, and this book, containing such excellent writers as Judith Ortiz Cofer and Gary Soto, is a strong resource for providing modern examples of differing aesthetics and points-of-view."
4,"Sweet, old-fashioned novel","Published in 1930 and set in the 20's, this was a story about two writers, David and Rosamond, who meet and find they have a lot in common. But Rosamond wants to remain independent and unmarried so she resists furthering the relationship. But in the end they live happily ever after. It's just a sweet, old story with a fun glimpse into the 20's."
4,Long Lost Indie Fav,"As a teenager I had purchased this album and long enjoyed the sophisticatation of Red Rider. Since my record collection went the way of collector's and garage sales as I moved several times, I have been trying to recreate a digital library akin to what I once enjoyed on vinyl. It has been a search, but not even Napster, Wal-Mart and Microsoft could provide what Amazon and it's patrons had. Great price, great condition, and it has revived my collection giving me a unique corner for this Canadian group that should have seen more success stateside, if you ask me. Thanks to Amazon!!"
3,Right product slow turnaround,I know this is an obscure product so it took a little longer than expected to receive this. It is the right product and everything is good with it though.
3,Need a reality check? Read this book.,"I enjoyed the book very much. I can relate to the subject. We all have a desire to meet MR. or Ms.""Right"", ""That perfect mate"". And usually our expectations are unrelalistic. Ms. Brown's book gives is a refreshing,down to earth and sometimes funny view of human nature."
1,Ive had enough,"I am sick and tired of these oh so boring boy meets girl stories. I know there is so much more to the black experience than finding a man/woman, keeping a man/woman etc. We have here nothing but a genre of black harlequin romances.Please someone -write something else. Maybe there is a market out there for this unstimulating, empty, repetitive nonsense. But I have to believe that there are black people out there who appreciate good well written literature and who want to read books that remain with them for life. Also please, ma'am there are way too many commas where they should not be. Finally this book is hypocritical-on the one hand the main character has turned into this wonderful born again christian, yet one is left with the idea that the material things like the huge diamond are still very important amd help to validate this relationship. Not a waste of my time-but a wake up call to me to stop reading trash."
3,Interesting,"This was an overall entertaining story, but I'm thinking that I've probably overdosed on male/female relationship stories. Also, it was poorly edited and in many instances the writing was stilted, especially the tag lines following the dialogue (he curiously asked, etc.) This is usually a problem in a self-published book."
4,An inspirational read,"I enjoyed this book. It started off a little slow, but soon I couldn't keep my hands off of it. The story doesn't preach to you, instead it gently offers a suggestion on how to find peace in your relationships. If you feel you are in the same situation, take a look at this book. I guarantee you wont' regret it."
4,This book was inspirational.,"First of all, I really enjoyed this book. It was the first book I have read that didn't endulge in sex. As I was reading, I found out that in some instances I was going through the same thing as Rachel. I also learned that maybe it was time for me to build a better relationship with God. I think the book could have done away with the time gaps and could have been a little more detailed but it was a outstanding book. I hope to read more by this author."
1,We Need a Series Boxed Set!,"I rated one star not for the show itself, but for this DVD and the few others that were released. These DVDs are missing a few minutes, often the teasers before the theme song comes on. I am also befuddled at the lack of a complete season or series set of this wonderful series. It would be so awesome if a series boxed set was released, with each and every minute of the show accounted for, and the Ask Jackie bits as well. I'm not sure why the quality of these DVDs are so poor, or why only a few were ever released."
2,Warning: They Left out Pieces..,"The rating for this video has to do with how the dvd is set up and not the show. The first couple mins. of each eposide is cut out of the video (all the parts before the opening). If you want to see the entire show, I sugest you see it on tv. Besides that it is a funny series (4 stars) and this dvd contains the snake, sheep and rabbit episodes."
3,Old Time Training,"This movie was developed to teach FBI agents, probably around the 1930's. Although the equipment is old, like wooden boxes for crime scene equipment storage, the basic concepts are correct. Interesting to watch if you are a fan of CSI, or teach Criminal Justice."
5,Gave new life to my rx7 fd coupled with arc airbox,"this filter, (both of them) mated with my new arc airbox, made such a difference to the car that I am thinking of keeping it instead of selling it. It delivers."
3,Works ok,It works pretty good for the most part. My cat constantly tries to get them off him. Would suggest stronger glue.
3,Soft Claws - Need 2 people to apply,"My husband and I just finished the second application of Soft Claws to our VERY active 8 month old kitten, and I felt the need to write a review. We both like the Soft Claws a lot, since they protect our furniture,clothes, skin, dog, etc. from a playful swipe of the paw. I would like to suggest that it is a very good idea to have someone help with the application. For us, it takes one person to hold the cat (and keep him calm) and another to actually do the gluing and putting the caps on. Also, you need to make sure the claws are trimmed before the caps are put on. Depending on the personality of the cat, application can be very difficult. I also think declawing is inhumane, but the cat is howling and squirming during each application, is that humane? This is why my review is only 3 stars."
4,good but with a warning,I've had these on my two cats for about three weeks. They were easy to put on with one other person helping me. Neither cat minded a bit despite one of the cats being very shy. I've seen no sign of them chewing at them. I was greatly relieved because I was afraid to have them declawed at 9 and 10 yrs old BUT they were decimating leather furniture. One problem came up: one cat has gotten stuck to a blanket and then to a stuffed animal when kneading. I don't know if this is a fit (size?) problem or from growing out or if perhaps I used too much glue for it to come off. It's quite disconcerting.
4,Stops shredded carpet,Soft Claws work great!! My cat was able to pull a few of the off but most of them are sticking strong. Plus she has not shredded the carpet since. I do recommend having a vet put them on cause it is kind of difficult to cut a cats nails on your own. Other wise its a great product and a much better alternative to de-clawing your cat.
1,no way!,"My cat had chewed these off within an hour of putting them on. Luckily I bought the blue ones, so I could find all of them.Maybe your cat is more tolerant of these, but mine would have none of it!"
2,No way!!,"I bought these soft claws because it seems like a really good idea...Not for my cat, all he has been doing is chewing them off, he is down to four now. I like the idea of these but I wish there were an easier way of getting them on and staying on! Maybe its just my cat...better luck to everyone else. Good product but just not for my cat."
4,Great Product!,"Comes virtually ready to go, and does a great job! Only downside is it takes a bit to get a large amount of ro/di water. No biggie though that's how all ro/di filters that do not have a pump are. Overall very satisfied!!!"
2,Sigh ... just sigh,"So I ordered this item and got it about a week ago, also ordered the suggested TDS meter which makes since if you are ordering a RO/DI unit. Got it installed tested the water PERFECT 0 PPM! Now today (1 week later) tested the water 117ppm ... WHAT are you kidding me ... that's what my tap water reads. This can't be, this thing is new. I just the day before used it to make up 20 gallons (untested ... shame on me) for a 2nd aquarium that I needed to house some incoming fish that I really didn't want. Long story short I tested some distilled water 0, retested water out of the BLUE line 117 ppm.something is bad with this unit.I LOOOOOVE Amazon, I'm actually on hold with them right now as I write this. They are sending me a replacement ASAP. Yay Amazon, boo Coralife.Moral lesson, make sure to TDS test your water before using it... ALWAYS!"
1,You get what you pay for,The 50 gallon per day membrane is not made by Aqeon and failed after two months of light use. I purchased a TDS meter when I got suspicious that the water was not pure. The water in my reserve tank measures 25 ppm. The hose connections are cheap and blow off when used with the shutoff valve and float also made by Coralife. I have ordered a Bulk Reef Supply RO/DI unit to replace this unit. My wife will not let me flood the basement again.
4,Good for the money...,"I have this set up as a continuous drip in my freshwater tank. Works well as the TDS is at or nearly zero but there were leak problems. It leaked initially and had to Teflon tape some fittings and even replace one but now that it's been a few months, it seems to spring a leak every now and then and I either have to Teflon another fitting or replace one. Just keep an eye on it but would still recommend it as it does work well and is a good price."
4,"SLOWWW, but good","I needed RO Water for my 75 gal tank. I purchased this from AMAZON, and hooked it up to my kitchen faucet (you will need to get a metal facuet adaptor from ACE Hardware).Unit works OK, But is VERY SLOW at producing RO water, maybe 1 gallon per hour! Also the red tube must be placed in the drain as it makes waste water at the same time. Just PLAN AHEAD and make it in 5 gal carboys or buckets!"
2,....missing parts ...,Got it .... opened it up ...and the Premium Thin Film Composite was missing. It looks like it might been a return resend back out ... box a little damaged.All the numbers given to contact them ...example: 310-851-8999 were out of order. The 800 number couldn't be reached as it's a local 800 number.Very disappointed that I had to spent an hour trying to contact someone about this ...and in the end ...However Amazon is picking it up via their return policy and sending a new one right away
4,Don't buy it from GetitGotitGood,Product is probably fine. I wouldn't know though because I haven't recieved mine from GetitGotitGood. They took my order and my money and 5 weeks later I still haven't gotten anything from them. Buy from them at your own risk & pray that it goes smoothly because there is no such thing as customer service from GetitGotitGood. More suitable name: WantitTooBad
3,Maybe it was better in Dutch,"Mr. Coerver may be the best soccer coach in the world. He certainly thinks he is. There is no discernable humility in anything he says.I found that the text had very little connection to the pictures. In most cases, if I wanted to understand what was being discussed, I could look at the pictures or the text, but not both.I rented the video, and it was better than the book, but trying to relate the video items to the book was impossible. It reminded me of the dubbing in ""What's up, Tiger Lilly?"" in which the dialog continued after the scene changed."
2,what?,"Well, I thought this should be a good book. It is not. All pictures that look like isolated freeze frames from a movie with zero intelligible explanation. For example, the ""double scissors"" is illustrated by about 30 pictures of a kid standing around a ball. A thumbnail text accompanies this, explaining nothing. Too bad, but this is a book that is simply incomprehensible. Well intentioned though. Much better books on coaching fundamentals are out there."
3,Get Tapes with This Book...,"The fundamental principle of Coerver is critical -- kids need to be comfortable with the ball at their feet. Too many youth coaches in this country concentrate on tactics and team play, not techniques and fundamentals. Coerver's view is a healthy corrective to this. That being said, this book is not as useful as the Coerver tapes series. Every coach should see or own ""Play like a legend"" and the first two in the 3-part series. By age 10, every player -- even your unathletic players -- should be able to explain, and execute 5-8 of the Coerver moves; by age 12, they should have another 5 or so in their arsenal. Even if they only use the Beckenbauer (a cutback with the inside foot) or the Littbarski (a step on and reverse direction) in games, they will likely be more skillful than their opponents."
4,"Score, basics of technique.",This book is very useful in educating young soccer players. It covers all the basic techniques young players need to develop in order to play the game at a high level. The pictures in the book are very well suited for fine-tuning your technique. If you are not familiar with the technical aspects of soccer the pictures may be a bit hard to interpret. But for coaches already involved in youth training this is a guide which you should have.Major weakness of this book is that it focusses on only one aspect of soccer: technique. Don't expect to find much useful information about tactics (despite of the subtitle of the book). Still it is a 'must have' for youth coaches working with young players.
5,A cut above the usual stuff,"I wear these shirts every day to work. In my size (3xl tall) I don't have a huge selection so it's nice that they have a good selection of colors.When shopping for t-shirts, I'm looking for a decent quality that will stand up to many washes without fading and in particular shrinking.I had been happy with Russell Athletic Pro-Cotton tees until they shifted production from Pakistan to India. Now a new Pro-Cotton shrinks vertically extremely quickly, is lighter weight and a magnet for pet hair. The Harbor Bay shirts are totally superior to the Pro-Cotton and well worth the price."
3,Purple T,The shirt was the color that I wanted but I did not realize that getting a tall would put the pocket that far out of position. That is alright as I will try to fix this on my own. Other than that I was satisfied with my purchase and the process to get it.
5,T- shirt,These shirts are great to wear. they are loose and comfortable. they are colorful. I like them a lot. They come in all sizes.
2,Voltage Confusion,"I am very confused with the description of this Welder! In one area it says that welder is 100 Amp! In another area it says the machine is 220 Amp, and finally I saw a it listed as 210 Amp. With the description saying these different Amps I would be very hesitant to purchasing a welder not fully aware of its Amps!..."
5,A wonderful resource for facilitators,The service from these people was PHENOMENAL and the easel pads are just great. If you've been balking at paying the prices charged in the chain office supply stores this is your solution. I do several conferences/classes a year and I've been looking for a good source of easel pads. I've found it. If you're a bulk purchaser for an institution or company you'll save a lot of money with these folks over chain office supply stores. Nice job!!
2,Likely Won't Purchase Again,"I've bought two sets of magnecor plug wires, each for a different vehicle, and each vehicle now has difficulty starting and/or maintaining idle for the first minute - merely changed the plug wires to these and now I have ignition issues. Prior to this change things worked smooth as silk.I'll keep my distance for now."
4,Pretty cool.,"Pretty good follow up to Loop's ""A Gilded Eternity"". Not as good, but pretty cool for headphone induced trance experiments."
3,Moderate success,"I had moderate success with this shampoo. It helped, but did not eliminate the itching and scratching. For more severe issues, which my dog had, you may want to try something more medicated. However, this is a good shampoo for regular use."
4,"double cd for cheap, go for it",the first cd is a must have the second gets a bit if'y but the price is right
5,Still my sons favorite book.,I gave this book to my son for a first birthday present.This very clever book allows you to add photos of you child or children. It follows delightful text and when you lift the flap to see who's there...surprise it's your darling child! We had to buy another copy so our daughter could have a book of her own. We've read them daily for over three years now!!
1,A gift that was unacceptable,"Unfortunately, I purchased this book as a gift. When the thank you card arrived it stated that the thought was appreciated but the book was in totally unusable condition and was being thrown out due to the musty, moldy odor and the flaps were bent beyond repair and it was dirty. Beware!"
4,Enjoyable read.,"15 years ago Cort devasted Laura's life. Since then Laura has been wary about letting men get to close. If they do she runs a mile. Now Cort is back in her life. When he hears Laura's plans to have a baby with a friend of their's, Cort decides that he is the one to give her what she wants.A very enjoyable read. I hope there will be a book for Steff (Cort's sister)."
5,A Real Keeper,"Laura has a plan to fill a void in her life. The Hayes Street Gang sets about making her see she is going about it in the wrong way.Cort takes charge and there are hot, blazing fireworks. HOT HOT HOT!!!"
5,I fell in love with this hero!,"There's a certain feeling I'm looking for when I read a romance. This book really delivers, from beginning to end. The love story is fabulous. If you like hot, don't miss it."
2,Interesting Archeology But Poor Conclusion,"This book is too shallow to draw any conclusions, especially to support a local flood theory. The archeological evidence is interesting. But this says nothing in particular about a flood. Had Mr. Wilson concerned himself with GEOLOGICAL evidence, he may have had a completely different conclusion. Geological evidence from around the world supports the Biblical description of a worldwide catastrophic flood, the magnitude of which, would leave little or no evidence of antediluvian cultures. The ARCHEOLOGICAL evidence in the book only serves to show how primitive mankind still was after for some indeterminate time AFTER the flood."
2,The Biblical Flood,The entire book is devoted to a list of places and people who at some time in the past have had a flood. It hardly even discusses the biblical flood and appears to just put it into the broad catagory of just another flood.Boring to read
3,interesting conjectures,"Mr. Wilson presents and interesting compendium of archaeological evidences and conjectures to advance his theory. There's certainly a plethora of evidence to support the idea that advanced cimilization spread from the general area of Turkey.Ian goes wrong with his assumption that the biblical flood event was not correct. He assumes the occurance of some LOCALIZED flooding, which was responsible for the diaspora from Turkey. The biblical flood did, of course, cover the whole world, and only Noah and his family survived.To combine the biblical account with the compiled archaeological evidence, it's possible that Noah and his family lived in Turkey in an advanced neolithic culture. After the biblical flood, Noah's offspring were responsible for the diaspora from Turkey to which Mr. Wilson refers.If you can look past the author's obviously anti-biblical bias, the archaeology/history in his book is fascinating."
1,A tedious work full of non-sense!,"This book argues against the biblical story of Noah's Ark, yet fills in the biblical blanks with contrived non-sense. The author does not believe anything in the biblical narrative. He believes the earth is billions of years old, and he calls the story of Noah & the Ark absurd and untrue. Now, if he doesn't believe any of that (and no Christian/Jew/Muslim is making him do so) then why in the world does he write a book about the time before the flood? His own ideas about a flood near Turkey take far more faith to believe in than the simple, clearly-written account in the Bible. He should stick to writing books about that which he knoweth, not that which he doth not comprehend."
