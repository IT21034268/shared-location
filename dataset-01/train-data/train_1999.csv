1,Quiet possibly the worst movie ever,Not even Jennifer Garner in tight clothes could make this movie worth a second watch or first watch come to think of it. AVOID AT ALL COST.
1,Most boring superhero movie ever,"It was a waste of 2 hours.I thought daredevil was weak, but this made daredevil feel like crouching tiger."
1,Is there a zero or negative rating??,This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. I like the actress and her costume-- though it was silly for a super-hero. But this was awful. A complete waste of time and money. It was almost as bad as 'Closer.' Be warned! Don't waste your time!
2,Why Can't they Make a Decent Female Superhero Movie!,"I really like Jennifer Garner as an actress, and I enjoyed Daredevil to a point, so I thought this movie might be o.k. But as it ran with superhero speed from the movie theatre to rental status, I began to wonder. Unfortunately, I was right. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Yes, Jennifer Garner looked spectacular, but she sort of wandered through the film with a glazed look, probably wondering when the real script was going to show up. The ""bad guys"" where cliche, and some of them seemed straight out of X-Men and Spiderman. I am usually a Marvel fan, but honestly, I'm hoping that DC will bring us a really good Wonder Woman movie to redeem woman superheroes. Come on, guys, you can write better than that."
1,YOUR KIDDING RIGHT? DO NOT BUY!,"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MARVEL MOVIES EVER! I BET THIS MOVIES GROSS IS THE LOWEST OF ALL MARVEL MOVIES. POOR PLOT POOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT HOLES IN THE ENTIRE STORY NO REAL CONTINUITY, I COULD GO ON AND ON. JENNIFER GARNER COULD NOT SAVE THIS HORRIBLE SCRIPT(I LOVE HER ACTING). TOO BUT THIS DVD WOULD BE TO CONDONE THIS TYPE OF FLASH MOVIE MAKING. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE DIRECTOR CUT EITHER!!! JUST READ THE AMAZON REVIEWS, NOTHING NEW THERE."
1,good dvd release but worst superhero movie i've ever seen,"I'd never seen this movie in big screen, but one of my friends told me it was an average movie. when the dvd released, I Bought to put it near my daredevil DVDs (special 2 discs edition & directors cut), oh my... when i watched it... it was not an average movie but one of the worst superhero movies i've ever seen. too much lies! terrible actings and a boring story! not comperable with daredevil in any way, daredevil was a five star movie but this can hardly get one star! its just like one of jackie chan recent and cheap movies with a TV Worthy picture and special effects. it's not even worth to rent. don't be fool by the beautiful and kind of sexy photo on the cover of dvd! don't buy it even you are a super hero DVD Collector"
2,Not as expected,I work for the entertainment industry with different movie theaters and movie rental places and i have seen many different action spin-offs. I liked daredevil and i enjoyed the different marvel films but electra really disspointed me. It was short on a real plot and didn't really make anything interseting. It seemed to me that they really could have made it more appealing like what the prieviews showed. It made you belive it was going to be an awesome movie and i actually nearly fell asleep.
3,Would the real Rob Bowman please stand up?,"While I was watching this movie in the cinema, the dark scenes reminded me of The X Files. What a coincidence. In the end titles, I read that Rob Bowman directed this comicbook film, a guy who came into existence directing The X Files.I thought Elektra used cinema reasonably. Still, I felt afterward that comicbook-superheroes-sent-to-film are a waste of time, and critically here is the case again. I can even accept that a movie should create its own premise, but still this plot seemed to fling things at me just because they were cool, rather than because they had any justification. Why make this story supernatural? Because comicbooks can do what they want? Illogical thinking. When making a movie, the plot needs to have an internal association with the viewers. If that association is not clear, you aren't doing them any good.At least this movie was better than Bowman's Reign Of Fire. The X Files is still his best film."
3,Somewhat 'elektrifying'.,"I thought this movie was okay, but it seemed to be missing something. I do believe Daredevil was better. Jennifer Garner is as always a great actress and here was no exception, I believe Jen fans will be pleased. I also believe that non-Jen fans could possibly enjoy this as well. The extras section is full. The best part of the movie is the ending, that is where most of the action takes place. I would say a rental is good."
3,it's a fun movie,no further required 17 more words required? that's just stupid and unrealistic. demanding what isn't needed is rude and stupid
5,Love this Movie,"The beginning of the movie started by describing what she could not remember happen to her when she was a little girl which devastated her and cause her begin killing certain people for money. Being a special type of child, other organizations wanted her at any cost. I do not want to tell the story but it is worth watching, it has majical characters in it and skilled fighters like the blind man who tried to teach her right and wrong including fighting technique. Highly recommend."
3,Not a bad movie--I liked it.,"After seeing the theatrical version of Daredevil, I was a little skeptical when I thought about seeing ""Elektra"" (see my Daredevil review for further explanation). However, after seeing the flick I have to admit that it wasn't bad. The story was pretty decent and the action was cool. Jennifer Garner did a pretty good job too, although I could have done without the annoying and obviously fake green contact lenses she wore. At any rate, Elektra is an entertaining movie not a bad comic adaptation at all.This DVD Director's Cut has very nice extras as well. I especially loved the Frank Miller interview in the ""Elektra the Comic Book Character"" documentary. It is interesting to hear how he first developed the character how she has evolved through the years. The ""Elektra in Greek mythology"" documentary is really good too.All in all, this movie is a good purchase; I think you'll like it. Caesar says thumbs up!"
1,broken and late,I received the remote in the mail and took it to an installer and he tried like 20 times and tried different ways and still would not program. So be prepared to send it back or cut your losses.
1,This speaker makes a better paperweight!,I bought this speaker from a home audio place thinking I could have a nice 250 watt sub. Instead all I got was a nice new paperweight. This speaker is from the white trash collection. It blew out in less than 20 min. and it was a complete waste of money! Be smart and NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT!
4,This is a great sub.,"I've owned about 15 home audio subwoofers and this is one of the better if you're into music.It blends much better than most with the rest of your system. Most subs these days are tailored for home theater and sound terrible to my ears with anything but the bulbus BOOM of movies. This subwoofer is hugely adjustable too. For the going used prices, it's certainly worth considering, whatever your purpose.BTW, I don't give 5 star ratings for the most part."
5,Dr. Ullis presents a plan that makes sense.,"Dr. Ullis's guide to evaluating personal health and longevity status is an interesting exercise by itself. It made me think about aspects of my lifestyle and habits that I hadn't really analyzed before. After completing that segment of his plan I found a real motivation for implementing his suggestions. Especially helpful to me was the table explaining a wide number of supplement products. The table made it easy for me to sort out what would really help me from what might help me or what wouldn't help at all. Thanks, Dr. Ullis, for helping me feel more in control of my ""lifetime!"""
3,General information rather than specifics,"If you are relatively new to longevity, anti-aging etc., this is a good introduction. It presents general information. If you are looking for information you can apply in practice, such as the quantity of supplements you might consider taking and the respective scientific references, then it is not for you. In this case get ""Renewal the Anti-Aging Revolution"". It is the best I have read, period."
3,Driving a Cadillac on tranqulizers,"Reviewing a previous incarnation of this CD, David Hurwitz said that it was like meeting an old friend, but I lived thorugh the Ormandy era, and to me it's more like remembering an old nap. Ormandy readings are reliable, shapeless, without imaginaiton or even the desire for imaginaiton. They just sit there, and meanwhile his glorious orchestra--at least Ormandy had that to his credit--made Cadillac sounds for a driver on tranquilizers. I guess the other reviewers here are enamored of the sounds and don't care that Tchaikovsky is a much more vital, incisive, and even wilder composer than Ormandy registers."
2,Hit&Miss,if Stevie Holland can somehow channel Toni Tennelle type of vocal vibe then I'd say you gotta keep any eye on Her. Her voice works well on certain cuts but sometimes things are hit&Miss.give Her time.I look to hearing what she does in the future.right now She is still finding Her voice.
4,E R A,"All ERA fans need to own this CD/DVD combo. Reason being is that it comes with a great DVD that everyone (especially males!) will like.If you have never listened to ERA before and are curious, having a DVD to watch and listen to is the way to go.I really hope ERA comes out with more videos because they are so relaxing, yet energizing. The videos and music take you away to another time and place. Enjoy"
5,Very good product,Very good product so happy with this purchase as long as it complies with its purpose and also has good performance
4,Unique,"I bought this after hearing a few songs off the CD titled ""Era"". Overall I enjoyed this CD. The styles vary enough to keep my attention and lyrics are both in English and their made up Latin sounding language. It is a nice ambient music that some people may not find appealing. The chants are interesting, but with the addition of electronic sounds it really makes the whole thing come together."
4,Great fitting,I found this bra to be very comfortable and a great fit? I am a large cup size and find it hard to find good underwire bras. This suited me perfect
1,unhappy3,"I usually trust the reviews on amazon 9 out of 10 times I still do, however this bra's reviews mislead and product dissappoints, so here is my review of this bra, unless you like the pointy-cone (look) or 40's type of look this was not for me. this bra only receives 1 star because it is true to size and afterall a bra but to shape and look nice umm no...amazon still rocks and the company's shipping methods were timely and efficient..."
5,Great buy for the money!,This was a great purchase for me. The price was right. The condition was as expected and I saved a ton of money.
5,Dragonfly Shower Curtain,I am very pleased with my dragonfly shower curtain curtain. It is very well made and is exactly what I was looking for! I also purchaced the dragonfly shower hooks. Beautiful combination!
4,Queen of the Kitchen Apron,I really liked the quality of this item. It is a nice thick apron andthe emblem is really cute. I did miss the fact that the mitts did not come with it and was a little disappointed with that. But...my bad...I didn't read everything. Get it for your Queeen!
2,"Good, but droppers don't reach bottom of bottle.","They are functional, but they do not have the correct sized droppers, as the picture seems to show. The droppers come about 1/2"" shy of the bottom of the bottle. Seller said they could not send me 3"" droppers needed for the bottle or any other similar bottle with correctly sized dropper. Return was only option. I had to order 3"" dropper from someone else to fix the problem. Seller DID respond to my emails very quickly and offered the return option, and shipping was ultra fast. Just make sure you are getting what you need before ordering."
5,satisfied,"good article on sewing, lightweight, comfortable tooraloom. compilcado however something to adjust. not Recommended for works of high-level seams. only basic sewing"
3,Perfect for the beach,"Color would have been nice but other than that it's great for teaching kids what's what.Easy to use, I recommend it ."
4,Did the trick,"This book was required for a lab class that I was doing to finish up my bachelors degree. It had all the needed information in a compact form so that I could go to the tide pools and not be dragging around a large book. I was able to find out what kind of organisms that I was looking at and read about them at home, once I marked the pages (didn't want to fall in the water, and the tide was rising at what seemed like an alarming rate). I am not a beach person by nature so I enjoyed learning about something that I have had little to no experience with."
1,Inappropriate Adult Humor,I'm not sure how much Aaron McGruder was really involved in this book but the adult humor was a diappointing departure from the wit of The Boondocks comics. McGruder may be at his best when he is confined by what is acceptable to print in daily newspapers. The characters and drawings were not that appealing either. I have the other 3 books by McGruder and they are funny indeed.
5,nothing short of incredible,"Muddy is the LAST word I would use to describe these speakers. I would like to see the kind of crap the above reviewer is powering them with. I replaced a pair of B&W DM602's with these and a small Velodyne subwoofer and have never looked back. These are not made to produce bass. They are made to be perfectly flat all the way down to 100hz, which is where the subwoofer comes into play. I would not recommend these if you like loud heavy music and are not planning to get a sub. With a good sub however, I would pit these against speakers costing $1000's, no exaggeration there."
1,"muddy sound, audiophile quality alright","I brought a pair new, mainly due to quite a few positive audiophile reviews. However, I am extremely disappointed. The speakers sound unclear and muddy. It is worse than my old $200 Boston Acoustics bookshelf speakers, which were replaced by this pair.The only thing I can say about audiophile reviews - you are going to waste you money if you believe them.Audiophile quality, right..."
4,Night of the Gargoyles,"Night of the Gargoyles is a highly interesting, spooky gargoyle book. This spooky book has all of the things that gargoyles would do at night. All in all this is a perfect book for children.Eve Bunting uses ALOT of descriptive words in this book. It seems she uses at least three descriptive words on each page. Even if the pictures weren't there you could still very easily see what is happening in the story because of the use of the descriptive words.A lot of the younger children would like this book because of all of the little gargoyles they have in there that kids normally like. It seems that in this book kids could really get into it and they would actually listen. Even though this book is intended for kids they would ask some questions because of some of the words that they use in the book."
1,total crap,"Just pick up your bible, or go to church...but don't buy this bunk. The author quotes scripture as answer to everything. Don't look for answers or entertainment here. The book went out with the trash..."
5,NEW AVENUE OF THOUGHT FOR THE END TIMES,"The author claims to have had an out-of-body experience wherein answers to many mysteries were unveiled. And if you truly read the entire work, you will probably agree that much of the information appears to come from some higher bank of wisdom. This book seems to present many avenues of thought that we have not seen or heard before in similar works... it is NOT just a regurgitation or re-presentation of the usual.An eye-opening experience for believers and unbelievers of all cultures... including scientific and/or atheist backgrounds. This book logically untangles the phenomena that fascinate mankind while creating a SUPERNATURAL faith that can withstand the scientific test.It has chapters on everything from political conspiracies to reincarnation, from genetic hybrids to Jesus Christ... yet manages to tie it all together into a coherent, logical and shocking BIG PICTURE of reality. A MUST READ!"
3,New angle,"It looks like UFOs are now studied like a religion. I felt this in this book.The author wrote about religious ideas, Jesus and reincarnation.Do they really belong to UFOs?I was intriguided by the subjects.I am not disappointed by the book.It was an interesting affair."
3,Not What I thought,"I wouldn't recommend this book if the reader is looking for fact/evidence related material. I thought the book would contain primarily ""evidence"" to support much of the contents and, to me, it was more of the author's personal thoughts."
5,Great video,Wonderful to see the people that I grew up with. The quality is just like when I first watched it on my Blu-ray player
4,staying motivated in recovery..,this short (14 minute) dvd is perfect for support group meetings. Interviewed are real people in recovery as they explain how to stay motivated in recovery. They report the benefits of sobriety and what they have learned in their own personal journey of recovery.* highly recommended *
5,Comprehensive,"Any manager who lets his technical people build a security program without the rational kind of road map this book offers is asking to be ""owned"", that is, to be hacked, his Web site defaced, his firm's data trashed. Never, never wade into the muddy waters of cybersecurity without a good plan.This book is that plan: risk formulas, the nature of the threats, key tenets of a security program, key steps in constructing one, important policies to have, key steps in formulating a policy, key goals in information security, kinds of architecture to consider, kinds of infrastructure that underlie the program, steps in the life cycle for developing a secure system.Talk about comprehensive. A great way to introduce yourself to security from a high level view or to start building security for your organization."
4,Nice but misleading cover.,"First, I will list the only reason this received 4 stars instead of 5. The cover shows the teacher with a student. However, this dvd is performed by Yogi Jacob ONLY. There is no class and he is somewhat boring to listen to. Other than that, the dvd does deliver. His instructions are clear and gentle indeed. I think this would be great for people over 55. I enjoyed it except for the fact that I thought he would be adjusting students as per the cover of the dvd. I would recommend this to others."
3,IS SHE...???,"This is a very good album without any doubt but i'm sure this is not her best album...ok, ""Soy yo"" is very pop, is clubby, and fun, but i feel is not good enough...some tracks like ""Socorro"" makes me feel paranoic,""En tus brazos"" ""Sigo Intentando"" and ""No Te quiero Más"" are slows ballads not so bad,""Como un ángel"" is maybe the best and ""Noche Tras Día"" is the only one that i think is perfect. Anyway still is a good album.She did a good job, but actually she could do it better. And you know it."
5,Está excelente,"Excelente disco, sobre todo por las canciones: Sigo intentando, soy yo, socorro y si crees en mi, todas las canciones son buenas. Comprenlo no se arrepentirán."
4,Is it a fluke or does it really work?,"It's hard to know if this really works, but it certainly isn't hurting. I will keep using it and see. There really isn't a good clinical trial that I can present, but all I can say is that no one has said, ""What is that stink?"" Other than that, it does seem people react better to me, but how much of that is real I just can't quantify."
1,UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER,"Pherone Formula W-1 Pheromone Cologne for Women to Attract Men, with Human Copulins and 4mg of Human PheromonesProduct DOES NOT WORK!!"
1,Not a satisfied customer,"I am in the process of trying to return this product. It made me smell like I had TERRIBLE body odor, and did not do as it claimed.So far, the company has been helpful, but we shall see"
5,smells great,"This product smells great, though it is a bit sweeter than I expected. Overall, good purchase."
4,How it all hangs together!,"If you want to know how the DNA/three tier architecture stuff hangs together, this book is a good start. I found the source code a bit buggy (I aint perfect myself) but you'll learn a thing or two while trying to make the sample applications work.Good book!"
5,A Great Business Objects book!,"This book has done absolute wonders for my corporation in devoloping inhouse software. The video store application delivers the understanding of how business objects work together and how you can make the most out of each mothod without straying from the tightly-cohesive path! If you think you know how to program, forget it! You will learn so much more from this book!"
5,Excellent guide to learn the next round of have-to-know,"I've been playing with n-tier for the past 3-4 months and did not have a guide for it except for magazine articles. Could not get over the hump to complete ntier-think. Lhotka guided me there beautifully by succinctly working up to it, but constantly readdressing/reemphesising things points already made. Enjoyed it as much as any technical book in many moons. Wrox seems to put out a good product every time, for some reason ( I have no ties to Wrox)."
4,"If you're doing objects, consider this book","This is another of the great Wrox books.This book follows a real world Video Store application as it is built from the ground up using Objects. If you are interested in learning about Visual Basic Objects and classes, this is a great book to add to your library."
5,Excellent book for learning to use OO techniques with VB,"There are clear examples of code that illustrate the concepts covered in the text. It is a learn by example book with a lot of detail and insight into how the objects will interact. I tried to get into OO programming in VB with the D. Kurata book, but I just couldn't get past all the abstract text. This book backs up high level concepts with code and templates that you can use in the development of your own OO applications. A must read. No, I didn't get anything free for writing this."
2,no power button,It works ok but there is no power button. just a mute button... seems kinda pointless if it just keeps wasting the battery.
1,Stupid product design,"I was shopping for a very simple metronome that just keeps time with a relatively loud clicking sound. I had a QuickTime metronome before that worked well (yes, you always start at 100 BPM and then adjust it up or down, which is a bit annoying), and therefore thought this one would work for me, as well.However, this metronome has been designed to beat in a meter: either 2/4, 3/4, or 4/4. You have to pick one of those three meters, and the metronome will then click with a higher pitch on either every second, third, or fourth beat. This makes the metronome completely useless for anyone practicing music in odd or changing meters. The meter function would be fine if it were optional, but you can't turn it off.If you KNOW that you will never play music with odd or changing meters, this metronome might work well for you, but more advanced players should stay away."
4,Metronome,"I think the metronome is amazing, I was just disappointed to find instead of a click it was a series of beeps on certain pitches. It may be my fault for not reading carefully, but I was disappointed a bit by that. It took me a while to get the hang of it, but all in all it is a good product."
2,"Does it's job, but not a great investment","This pocket tuner is great for taking up little space, and keeps a good beat, but that is about all I liked about it.The high pitched clicks easily get on my nerves while practicing, in addition to being hard to hear over most instruments. The volume does not get very loud either. It is also impossible to get rid of a ""main beat"" click so you must always hear the BEEP-click-click-BEEP-click-click-click (or similar in 3/4 or 2/4 settings), but cannot get a simple click-click-click-click that is helpful when practicing mixed meter pieces.I would recommend buying a slightly more expensive metronome with more options - it will be worth your investment in the long run."
1,You get what you pay for,This is a low quality metronome that is difficult to use and broke after two days of use. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra money to get a higher quality metronome.
2,QT-5 Metronome,"Its OK for the price, I guess. However, this particular model does not shut off. The voice can be muted. however, the digital display continues to flash to the timing you have set. The booklets says that even though the display is lite it does not harm the battery life. How can it not? Doesn't the digital display use energy, especially when you've set the timing? Had I know this, I probably wouldn't have bought it."
1,CAN'T TURN IT OFF,"I bought it because it's cheap, small and portable. The problem with this product is that you can't turn the power off. I thought it was ok with this price at the beginning, but soon I found out that my battery was exhausted after few times of use. Now I gotta buy another better one which has a power switch on it."
1,Terrible,"The beat is very loud. When I want to turn it off, it won't turn off. And, when I try to set to a certain speed, it will jump to another speed without people touching it. Weird! Waste of money!"
1,Quickly broke.,"We went with Amazon's cheapest Metronome and quickly proved the old adage ""You get what you pay for.""This model worked for a day or two, then it started to revert back to 100 beats per minute shortly after we set it to any other BPM."
5,Finally! An ethics book I understand!,"I have an online ethics course in which all I do is read. This was a required text so I wasn't expecting much. Turns out, this book is really helpful. Not only does it explain things very well and asks thought provoking questions, but its review questions are very helpful as a self-check. It is well organized and written so you can understand it. I wouldn't try using a highlighter, it looks like it would bleed through."
3,"Good reading, bad textbook","I like the text, but the 2001 printing is apparently very different compared to the current edition. The layout is completely different which makes it unusable for class. Information is formatted in different chapters which makes it impossible to follow along in class. Great for the price, but dont use it far a class."
4,Critical thinking,"We are using this as text book for classes attained by local members of the community as well as community colledge students.This is a great guide to teach us how to think critically on difficult issues facing citizens today. If your community is involved in Philosopher-Citizen Project, by all means get involved."
4,"Great story, poor editing","Like the other reviewers I really enjoyed the story. It lost a star because of the typographical errors strewn throughout the book, things like 'per form' for perform, 'pleas ant' for pleasant, 'combat ants' for combatants. A spell checker will not pick up these errors, as each part of the word can stand alone! The best one was 'ordecidetoridehundredsofnules' which I can only think should be 'or decide to ride hundreds of miles'. I found these errors a distraction."
5,Loved it!,"SMALL TREASURES is a funny, charming and timeless historical romance set in the West. I started reading the book thinking I would just read a few pages to see if I was interested--and didn't stop until I reached the end!"
4,Fabulous!!,Couldn't put it down. The interaction between the characters was great and well developed. I can't wait to read more from Maureen Child.
5,Small Treasures,"Enjoyed every page of this wonderful story. Abby was fun and spunky, one couldn't help but love her. And it was so funny to read of Samuel's reactions to the things Abby would do. Loved the story and would recomend it to anyone who enjoys a well written, funny and tender love story. Will be looking for more books from Maureen Child, if they are this good. Well worth the money."
2,Huh?,"If I wanted a book about the scientific intricacies of in vitro, I would have bought a book called ""How to have IVF.""Some of the information is just plain wrong. Any woman who had as many antral follicles as Mr Silber suggested she should would be considered polycystic. It's a manifesto aimed at scaring a woman into rushing into IVF, and it certainly DOES NOT give you any helpful hints for getting pregnant."
4,Decent book.,Book was in very good condition and was very informative. I was worried about the condition of the book but I was surprised. The timing on delivery was on time as well.
1,informational,this book is informational...a lot of what your Gynecologist would already tell you. The author is clear and concise and it is an read. This might be useful for some.
5,Excelente ayuda para las parejas con problemas de fertilidad,"Este libro contiene información muy completa sobre diferentes tratamientos de fertilidad. Puede leerse por partes, o de pasta a pasta. Para mí y para mi esposa ha sido de mucha ayuda y complementa muy bien nuestras sesiones con el médico."
3,Bananarama with a Political Agenda,"Forgive me for having a long memory, but Out Hud sounds suspiciously to me like Bananarama, albeit one with a pronounced political agenda. That said, their dance-lite is very compelling and easygoing. I might find it even more refreshing if I heard it on the radio, or with some deep bass in a club. As it stands, though, it's a fun romp. But when it's over, it's over."
4,Bat Costume Very Cute,This is a very cute costume. It was sewed together off center and no fixing could be done. But Grandson had a ball with it. Really looked great with the make-up to match the material part.
4,So cute,"This costume was so great, especially for the price! Paired with black pants it is a great vampire costume. My son is 5 and he felt like a very scary vampire in it. It runs a bit small, I wish there were more sizing options."
5,"compact,stylish,great sound,ultramodern","It is beatifully finished, compact with heavy bass and crystalline treble. User friendly controls. Another success from Sony."
4,A very good system,"Despite being the previous model of Sony's entry-level micro-size HiFi stereo system, this unit offers a really good bang for the buck! It sounds wonderful, gets very very loud for those times you want it so, (despite it's rather weak wattage) and includes interfaces for Video and MD as well. Even a digital connection for the MD! Very stylish, good sounding. If you can find this cheap and in good condition, get it!"
5,Really good for the price,"Really good quality for the price, a little itchy until you break it in, also shrinks just a little when you wash it the 1st time. Fastest shipping I have had on any item I have bought on anazon, 3 days. all though this is probably just becaouse the time i orded it. Over all really satisfied with the product. also they forgot the belt, I emailed them and they shipped it immediately, got it quickly too."
1,Very stiff material,"This uniform is made of very stiff and scratchy material. I was going to return it, but shipping both ways costs more than the item. I guess I will try to wash it. I would not recommend this - especially for a child."
5,I love it.,The price and the quality work perfect for me. It looks great and didn't shrink. Not very heavy or cheap quality.
2,Black Gi,"We received the item very quickly. I have to agree with the mismatched review. The top is a different color than the pants. The top seems to be a bit more of a faded black and the bottoms seem to have a black/brown hue. Another issue I found - it only has 2 ties, both of them are on the sides. You can't tie the front closed because of the placement of the ties. For the price though, I will keep it."
3,Mismatched,Received item before expected time....great. One big thing is that the gi pants is a different shade of black to the gi top....a definite issue.
1,Not Tiger Claw,"I was surprised to find this is ProForce brand, not Tiger Claw. Looked very cheap and thin. When contacting Martial Arts Supermarket they told me it was the same gi, different name. Told them my son wanted Tiger Claw. They grumpily told me too bad that is what you get. I told them false advertisement. They said too bad. I was mad I had to pay $11 to send it back. I told them this and they said they would reimburse me, they never did. I am paying extra and buying from Century Martial Arts now."
3,Not Tiger Claw?!?!,"This gi fits as it should, and is great for the price. That said, I ordered it because it is being advertised as a Tiger Claw gi. I own several of those and have always been happy with them. This gi is not Tiger Claw at all. It is a no-name off brand. Don't advertise something as a brand that it is not. That is highly deceptive. It also took a full two weeks to get the product. The gi is a good product for a great price, but based on the dishonest branding and slow shipping I would not order from this seller again."
1,Uniform is Not What's Pictured,The karate uniform we received had 3/4 length sleeves. When we tried to exchange for what's pictured we were ignored until I e-mailed Amazon to find out why. We eventually received a refund with the seller explaining an exchange was not possible because we wanted full length sleeves on the karate uniform. (Like what's pictured!) The sizes also run small.
5,"Well made, professional quality","Elastic waist with drawstring pants (great for kids). Full range of sizes. In both black and solid white. Note: always check with your instructor before purchasing a uniform. Many schools prefer you buy your gear from them--or at least need to approve the style, weight to be sure it fits the program guidelines. Instructors may like the service, shipping and prices of the martial arts supplies offered by Amazon."
4,a useful source with very nice pictures,"The first half, focusing on the spirits and the iconography, is excellent. The rest of the book is, frankly, weak on content. It has a good bibliography and some good photography. The book is helpful if you plan to visit Buddhist temples or witness Shamanist kuts. On the other hand, if you are looking for academic work, this isn't it."
2,Snorefest,"What do you trust more: autobiographies or biographies? I prefer the latter because they tend to be more objective. This book is nothing more than a collection of brief and carefully controlled glimpses into the lives of a few famous and many not-so famous people.I purchased a copy of this book on the strength of the reviews on this page. Unfortunately, the book turns out to be a complete disappointment if you happen to be looking for insights into how these people became masters in their respective fields. Each brief 7 to 9 page chapter is simply a record of the author's one-hour, or so, visit with the subject. At the end of it all, the only insight you take away is that successful people are exceedingly courteous to authors planning on devoting an entire chapter to them.If you are curious about mastery, you will benefit far more from a reading of ""Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi."
4,"Accessible, Informative and thoughtful","Enjoyed this book a lot. It is well written and thoughtful. Not only worth the read, it presents a lot of thoughts worth mulling over."
1,Quite offensive misuse of Einstein's name,"That would be the cosmological constant that Einstein referred to as ""the biggest mistake of my life""? Not that he in any way intended it to be considered as an intelligent agent, as the author here would seem to wish us to believe.Personally I'd recommend reading something that isn't completely duplicitous instead, but maybe that's just my preference not to be misled, deceived or manipulated when I read a book."
1,Not so nice,"The sign is more red than orange. Plus, its not very thick metal, and arrived completely warped and non-presentable. Will end up tossing this in the trash. I would not recommend this seller."
5,A new classic,"I fell in love with this book the moment I finshed the first paragraph. I read Ann Rice's Interview with the Vampire and liked it well enough, but I, Vampire is so much more. This book, as is the case with Michael Romkey's other vampiric novels, are new classics. They have everything. Danger, romance, horror, a touch of sex, poetry, princesses, and murderers. Composers and sorcery. For the history buff, historic figures like Mozart, Jack the Ripper, Rasputin, and the lovely Princess Tatiana Nicolaievna Romanov. And of course, vampires."
4,A Fantastic twist in the vampire mythos,Vampires may just be the world's oldest legendary creatures. This book justifies that fact. The idea of the Illuminati and the use of historical characters grips you and holds you to the heart pounding end. This book does use large vocabulary but in a context that makes it easier to understand and adds to the atmosphere of the sophisticated vampire.
4,Vampires & historical figures? This is an interesting book.,"I liked the way the author included historical figures into the story. He tries to explain the vampire ""condition"" in a medical way also. This book is written in diary format making it easy to read in short segments. Very vivid story writing. Everyone I've recomended this book to loved it. The other two books in this series didn't grab me as well as this one but they still were great reads. This book would make a great movie if they didn't ruin it in production, as they usually do with books. Anne Rice this ain't but it's still a great vampire story. The author even tips his hat to the female writer from New Orleans within the story of one of his books"
4,The most enjoyable vampire book I've read in years.,"I generally read Thechno-thrillers, but I Vampire was a vary enjoyable change of pace. It is deffinatly a lite read. If you truly beleive vampires are out there then this book is not for you,but if you want a fast enjoyable book for the summer I Vampire is a good choice."
1,horrible gorehunk-slinging waste of paper pulp,"I love the vampire genre. I love books about vampires. This novel, picked up with such glee and expectation, turned out to be the worst piece of tripe ever printed on the page. It's a brain-crushing, tedious, charnal house plod into the sorriest attempt to capture the mystique of vampires. The women are horrible and cold. The ""hero"" is [yawn] BORING, and the gore, tedious."
5,I love this book,"I'm probably one of the few people who would rank this book up there with the best ever written. I might be the only person. But it is a great book, one I've read several times. Romkey takes the vampire tale and gives it a new twist. The first half of the novel, when David Parker first becomes a vampire, is a very lyrical novel. And the second half turns into more of an action sequence. And the two halves work well together. Romkey brings back just about every important historical figure, but it does keep it interesting. I've read most of what Romkey has written, including the other books in this 'series' and nothing else he has written reaches this level (that's not to say that his other book aren't enjoyable, most of them are good). I can't recommend this novel enough. It's great, and I think it should be one of those few books that everyone should read."
3,Interesting change from normal vampire plots,David's education and training as a novice vampire made for very interesting reading. It was a good plot and story line. But it lacked the action and suspense I normally look for in horror books.
2,"entertaining, yes. Worth $9? No.","As with Microsoft, there's a vicarious satisfaction to be indulged by taking the big bad corporation down a peg -- but this book lacks objective distance to balance out the vitriol. I'd hoped for a few genuine behind-the-scenes insights into what makes Disney culture unique, or uniquely irritating -- but was merely annoyed by the loss of $9.00 for a scant 83 pages with big type and HUUUUUUGE margins. Well, maybe that was a stylistic choice to compliment the book's mindset. ""See Disney be bad. BAD Disney. BAD!"""
2,Save your money,"Ten bucks is a lot to pay for what is ultimately an essay. If you want to read it, get it from the library. I found it an okay read, but felt the overall feel was a bit 'snarky'. I'd compare it to an essay from a high school nerd complaining about how bad the 'cool kids' are...when his main complaint is that they are, in fact, cool. It just felts like he dislikes them because they are successful. Hey, Disney as a corporation is neither all black nor all white. So I'd say this may be worth a read if you like to get both sides of the Disney story and want to read some negatives for awhile, but really, save yourself a few bucks and get it from the library."
1,Co-authors of The Disney Way Know Better,"We admit our bias, but this book chooses to focus on a great deal of personal ""sour grapes"", all from a reporter who apparently had some difficulty with the Disney organization. At least, from an NBC interview, that's what we believe is the real story. The Disney organization does so much to continue Walt's vision of "":providing the finest in family entertainment"", and they succeed. There are few benchmark organizations left in the world who are as worthy as Disney. But. . . you definitely need to ""take the gloves off"" to see the truth. Bill Capodagli and Lynn Jackson, co-authors of The Disney Way:Harnessing the Management Secrets of Disney in Your Company"
1,A biased look at Disney,"Just the fact that a radical and twisted individual like Carl Hiassen wrote this book is sufficient to show how biased it will be. Like an inmature preteen, Hiaasen criticisizes things that appeal to the mass public in an sick and inmautre fashion. Of course, one must remember that Hiaasun, as the author of ""Striptease"" is obsessed with adult material and dark humor as well as hard rock. Of course he dislikes a family oriented company as Disney. In the end, the book only convinced me even further that the Disney theme parks are an ideal place for a family vacation. Don't waste your money on this senseless trash."
2,Malicious and a little baffling -- Muckraking strikes again,"Hiaasen doesn't ever seem to justify his hatred of the Walt Disney World Company in this book, but rather repeatedly states that Orlando would be a backwater little village if not for the Mouse. Granted, I'm a bit biased, having worked for WDW, but still, even viewing it objectively, Hiaasen never seems to come out and say why he's muckraking, only that ""there's no scandal as delectable as a Disney scandal"""
5,Interesting and darkly humorous,"Carl Hiaasen's writing is always entertaining, but seldom is it as dark as this piece of work. He takes shots at perhaps the most sacred force in America, and maybe the world, today. Anyone living in Florida, Anaheim CA, or anywhere else Disney decides to take over know the way it operates, and the insanity and vigor which they operate with. Though this writing is well thought out, you can't help but feel an anger for Disney. What brought about this anger? Is it the take over of Florida and the dying tourism in southern Florida, or is this essay simply the raving of a man who had to wait too long in line for the Tea Cups ride. Either way, it's a good book, and a definite read on the future of corporate America."
5,Humourous Exposure of An Enemy of Civilisation!!!,"_Team Rodent_ does an excellent job of ripping away Disney's cutesy facade to reveal the company's many faults. Hiaasen goes beyond his philosophical objections to Disney and its program to describe the company's numerous sins, ranging from devious political manipulations to outright legal violations. _Team Rodent_ is an entertaining and enlightening read for all persons, not just confirmed anti-Disneyites. I have never cared for Disney's maintenance of the infantile status quo in American animation; _Team Rodent_ informed and strengthened my objections by depicting the true magnitude of Disney's malpractice."
3,Why on earth was it so short?,"Considering the length of some books I've seen about Disney, and the apparent familiarity of the author with the company, what's the point of cranking out a little pamphlet like this? It was pretty funny, but it took me about an hour to read and had no plot at all.There are some really interesting theoretical studies involving Disney, Nazism, fairy tales, psychology, etc., and I would have liked to see a little bit of intellectual depth attempted in this book."
3,83 Page White Paper,"Sorry to say Carl, as a Hiassen Fan, this was really disappointing. The first 20 Pages were a farily pleasurable Hiassen-kind of Rant, but the remainder was not all that good. Certainly, as others have said (a little less kindly), this Pamphlet is definitely not anywhere near worth the money or even the effort to read it."
2,add to prior review,"Since so many people wrote in after I did, I'd like to add a few things. I sure noticed the similarlity in LA Confidential to Walt Disney and Disneyland and that story was far more chilling than Hiassen's book here. I feel that he could have done a much better job and maybe published a full length bestseller if he were going to do an expose on Disney. Think about it--would a paper full of emotion about what George Orwell considered the menace of communism have been more effective than Animal Farm?"
2,Save your [money]...,"This is nothing but an 83 page pamphlet in which Carl Hiaasen vents his hatred for the Disney Corp. I have no problem with Mr. Hiaasen feeling this way although I like to take my family to Disney World.For the past 150 years, the railroads, builders and developers have controlled everything that happens in the state of Florida. They own all the politicians and whatever they want, they get. Disney just hopped on the bandwagon.I have read every book that Mr. Hiaasen has written for the simple reason that they are funny but I am glad that I bought this one from the used book store."
3,"Fun lite reading, but pointless","This isn't so much a book as a pamphlet, with 82 pages of large type and a lot of space. A shallow critique, but funny and a decent read. No revelations here. For real insight, read Mouse Tales."
2,A VERY SHORT book,"Even for $7.16, I expected a little more. This is one short book with large type and wide margins. It's not so much a book as a bound magazine article. It's that short. A better examination of the insides of Disney (and the Ultimate Book about Walt Disney World) is Stephen M. Fjellman's VINYL LEAVES."
3,A brief comment,"Hiaasen is mostly known for his bitingly funny and wacky novels, but here he delves into the essay genre in a funny, extended rant on the evils of the Disney empire. I enjoyed the book but it could probably have been cut down by one third or even half and it would have been all right. Many of the things he talks about are true, but much of it is satire, too, just like his fiction. His discussion of how the Disney World parks insisted on having their own police force, however, separate from the Florida police, almost makes his overall thesis credible. :-) If you're new to Hiaasen I would read one of his fiction books first rather than start here. But if you're a fan, it's still worth reading for its funny take on Disney and on Florida too."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have lived in Florida my entire life so I have heard the good and the bad about Disney. The author spends all of his time trying to find something negative about Disney but never really comes up with much, which I guess is why the book is so short. If this is the worst he could find Disney should be proud, some of the things he complains about are not even related to Disney."
1,Team Rodent: How Disney Devours the World,"This book really puts into perspective the way Disney handles its affairs, especially relating to merchandising their name. I appreciate Carl Hiaasen's humor and point of view. And he is right when he points out that people tend to trust the Disney name no matter what."
5,Great Fun!,"It Had To Be You has frequently amusing situations and interesting characters, including Sunny, the cheerful, accident-prone ER nurse, Dan, blunt, honorable, and extremely suspicious of his new stepfather, their respective sisters and brothers-in-law, Sunny's niece and nephew (my two favorite characters after Sunny), and the aforementioned stepfather who may or may not be out to swindle Dan's mother...The book covers a tropical cruise and includes situations and character such as the taxi driver who, told Sunny and Dan were in no hurry, drove calmly into the country to pick up his laundry... If you enjoy Christian fiction, I'd recommend it."
1,Rip Off,"I returned this book the minute I recieved it. The information in this book is useless, not to mention the fact that the book itself is microscope in size. 100 pages- that are smaller than the index cards I'm using to study for the bar. This book is another in a long series of books published to prey on aspiring lawyer's during a difficult time."
5,An important topic skillfully discussed,"The topics of this book are biological (""germ"") warfare, the implications of a biological attack on the USA and the policies that have (not) been put in place to deal with such an attack.The book has been very skillfully written, starting every chapter with a ""short story"" in which a biological act of terror unfolds, followed by hard facts. In the earlier chapters the facts concentrate on the science of infectuous disease. The latter chapters concentrate more and more on the authorities' sorry state of preparedness.The result is a work that grabs your attention whilst at the same time transferring important information without ever getting tedious. The perfect impression is rounded off in that the authors finish not on a damming note, but by discussing concrete ways forward and warning against excess fear and worry (if not concern).Highly recommended"
4,"Easy to understand, bone chilling","The average American can readily grasp this book's fairly complex subject matter -- helpful to those of us who aren't familiar with the world of bioterrorists. Tho' some of the writing is redundant, it is great, informative reading, though frightening. Author suggests that citizens can best take action by pushing for their local, state, and federal government to increase their preparations for bioterrorism. I would have had no interest in this subject before Sept. 11, but now it is incredibly pertinent."
4,Eye opener,"The good doctor's book was truly an eye opener for me. I found his 8 step plan invaluable as a mother with 3 children. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who values the sanctity of freedom from terrorism. I've been reading about biological warfare for years, and I find it fascinating. Also read ""Requiem"" by K.M. Bourgeois and ""The Eleventh Plague"" by John S. Marr M.D. and John Baldwin"
5,Awesome Reference,"This is a great set of DVDs for anyone interested in learning swing aerials. Many different moves covered at varying degrees of difficulty. All are taught using elaborate step by step instruction, as well as accompanying exercises covering concepts that will help you build the control necessary to execute advanced moves safely. If you think you're ready to take your dancing airborne and want to do so without ripping your partners' limbs off, this is for you. Also cool just to keep around as a reference. I have a fairly large collection of swing and lindy clips, and DVDs. This set is a standout in terms of instruction and overall production quality."
3,"Incomprehensible for the layman, and needlessly so.","This is very probably a great book. Scholars and linguist majors may well find it a treasure. But it is nearly incomprehensible to the layman -- and needlessly so. The author uses a torrent of highly technical terms but never defines or explains them. There is no glossary. There are no parenthetical or footnoted explanations. What is worse is that the author makes almost no attempt to state clearly just what he is talking about. For example, he spends much time stating, and describing in mind-numbing analytical detail, the technical differences between Biblical Hebrew, Rabbinic Hebrew, and modern Israeli Hebrew. But he never once gives an example of how a typical sentence would read in Biblical Hebrew, Rabbinic Hebrew and Israeli Hebrew. The same is true of his comparisons between early Hebrew and cognate Semitic languages. The reader is left bereft of simple, helpful statements. The book is best left to the linguist. Laymen avoid!"
2,Just a Regular Brush,"Nothing special about this hairbrush, it is a typical brush. For a real tangle friendly brush get this one... The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush (you don't have to use it in the shower obviously) - this works on all 3 of my kids - all agree that it does not hurt and one has straight, medium length thick hair, one has super long, curly hair and the other had thinner long hair."
5,Phillips Light Touch #2 Oval Brush,"The Phillips brushes are the best out there. Your scalp gets a wonderful massage every time you brush your hair, without scratching.I have purchased 3 brushes now...my daughter has absconded with one because even she loves it more than other brushes she has."
5,Great Brush,"This is a fantastic hair brush. It works well with fine or thick hair and is excellent for wet or dry hair. I love brushes that have the little plastic tips on the bristles, they're much more comfortable and it can feel like a little massage for your head."
4,Not the best but I like it,"This is replacing an old brush that I really, really liked. This brush rates only 1 'really', but then we only just met."
2,Alvin has lost his way,"Card spends two thirds of the book exchanging banter between characters, none of which advance plot or advance character development. We then end up with Alvin waiting around in jail (again) and an impending courtcase (again). Oh woe the day Verily Cooper was introduced so Card could stick his books into a court case to explain what he wants to tell us.I loved the 1st 3 books, was okay with the 4th book (but only okay), and this book made me angry. And this book did little, if anything, to advance the overall story arc of The Tales Of Alvin Maker."
3,The sense of destiny is gone.,"Card writes compellingly, as always, and it is always a pleasure to rendezvous with the inhabitants of this well-made series. Yet, I was left feeling vaguely cheated. The sense of destiny that informed the earlier novels is missing here--Alvin et al. just wander around, eventually getting mired in two fairly uninteresting conflicts. When I picked this one up I was hoping for resolution, but this book leaves us right where we started from. Maybe next time."
3,Good book not very intense,"Heartfire does not have the same intensity as, for example, Ender's Game or Songmaster, but it is a fine book. A good revisit to Alvin and his world and a fine exposition of a standard Card theme of the importance of the community and the responsibility of an individual to his or her community."
3,The Journey Continues,"It was very obvious to me after the first chapter of Alvin Journeyman the OSC was DONE telling this story. I was very surprised to find Heartfire. I re-read the first 4 books and read Heartfire all in the same week. I really enjoyed it, and at the end of the week I was waiting for another chapter in the Alvin story. (I waited a long time between Prentice Alvin and Alvin Journeyman, and I will sure wait again for more stories about these characters.)The story was entertaining, and there are loose ends all over the place. To me this promises a continuation of the stories and the characters that I love. OSC is great at maintaining character personalities. He builds a person that you would recognize if you met them. I am grateful for the catalyst to blow a whole week of my life just relaxing and enjoying a comfortable and familiar tale.I can't wait to do it again."
1,Triple Tripe. What a waste. I regret I bought this book,"this was tghe worst book i read since the earthborn series that card also forced us to read and buy. His writing is worse and worse with each passing book. even the last speaker of the dead book was a stinker. what's the metter with you orson? You seem to have lost the will to tell a story. Instead you books are entirely composed of people discussing the weather and meaningless tripe. What happened to plot? action? dialogue? [needless to say I really liked card's early work, and like many of you, always think that his next book will mark a return to quality].MP END"
4,A Great Story Continued,"Even though I thought the first 75 pages were a little slow, once I got into this one I couldn't put it down. I can't wait till the next one is due out."
3,No one else wrote a review?,I have this tape in my basement and I watched it a few time's.I'm kinda foggy on the specific's but this is great old savetheworldinagiantrobot anime.The sound is pretty cool and c'mon when Voltron form's you know you get goosebump's.The character's have some pretty cool move's that they yell.It's got kind of an adult theme between two character's but not much.Here put it this way.Think Power Ranger's with lion's.That's it.That's all this is.But I still like it.Buy this to remember your childhood and to get into old anime for a night.^^
5,One collection you'll never forget!,"Every Carpenters fan will treasure this 4-CD collection. It contains gems from 1969-83 that were never released, while maintaining a consistent amount of the hits of their career. The book in the inside is definitely insightful as well. Don't miss out on FROM THE TOP. It's worth every penny!"
4,I like the box set but it should have had more of their best,"I like the box set but it should have had more of their best tracks. For example,tracks like Crystal Lullaby,Drusilla Penny,Flat Baroque,Heather,Help,Love is Surrender,Saturday,Road Ode,Oldies Melody etc(I could go on a while!) could have been put on the box set with 4 cds. After all,4 cds can contain a lot of songs. One unkind reviewer in America,at the time of release of the set, really unfairly canned the Carpenters because she judged them on this box set which doesn't contain all their best songs. A box set should represent their absolute best. As I said,I like the box set(with The Carpenters superb vocals and production,it has to be good)but with so many tracks only available in Japan I hope that Richard can go for the ultimate next time and that is-live tracks,best songs and rare gems."
4,Great sensitivity!,"I found the midi setup in ableton to be a bit of a pain when mapping to drum kits, but otherwise really enjoyed the sensitivity of the pads themselves. Along with the on the fly flam, roll, and hold per pad setup, mapping effects to the x-y pad I had a whole different sound in comparison to my midi keyboard. The light effects for each pad as well as velocity control make me feel more in touch with my sets, as well as make it a bit more fun for shows.Not being DAW guru I still have a lot to learn about this pad, but find it worth the price and would recommend as a necessary in terms of drum pads. I believe BOSS makes a similar pad, but I've never used it so I don't have much of a comparison otherwise. I've heard back and forth reviews about KORG's nanoPad so I decided to step it up and go with their full version, hence my purchase.Needless to say I'm pleased with my purchase and the new capabilities offered."
5,A steal!,I had high hopes from this controller (or should I say Kontroller) and it stands up to the task!the individual 4x4 pad grid is not too big to move around in real time performance and not too small so you know what you are doing.a red indicator lights up under each square when you press it and I found that to give great eye response in situations where you can't hear everything.The controllers themselves are very sturdy and durable. you get a velocity indication when you hit the pad on the 3 digital numbers on the top left corner which is also a nice touch.XY pad is a great add-on to this pad and very much worth the extra money.The entire controller is super customizable yet super easy to use. you can change banks with a turn of a dial and every botton can be customized.I am very happy with it. I get great feedback from it in real time.highly suggested!
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I very RARELY write reviews but I was so irritated with this journal I just HAD to. I was SO excited to began writing in this book for my new baby. Got it and was very disappointed! The only thing nice is the art and thats it! The family tree part was soo confusing! So many mistakes were made because of the unclear family tree page that we had to tear those pages out. The mobile in back is cute but not even long enough to hang on the ceiling. This book is VERY basic. There are no interesting questions to answer about your baby. Just normal basic things like first foods, first smile etc. Just enough space to put a picture and a small note. So bummed....to the trash it goes...that was a waste of $13..."
2,many problems,"This unit worked for 18 months before the VCR jammed up with a tape inside, and 18 months longer before it started spontaneously shutting off and refusing to turn back on until the next day. Sony quality has slid SIGNIFICANTLY. I used to buy only Sony, but after three VCRs and two TVs, I'll never repeat this mistake."
1,really for the absent minded,"Unless one is from another planet, or hasn't been reading about COBOL for a few years, there is hardly anything new in this book. All the COBOL specific material can be found FREELY at Fujitsu's website or in the Help System for the COBOL for .NET release candidate. The non COBOL stuff is either trivial (Object Model) or out of context (Windows 2000 API).In a word, I was expecting new material and bought a compilation."
3,ok but not great,"some of the stories are too vague, but that could just be me. i will continue reading through the volumn, but many stories left me wondering why they were published...."
4,Variety of settings with Phantom power,This direct box is convenient as it has a variety of db noise reduction settings as well as a battery/phantom power switch which is nice in conjuction with my mixer board. This direct box is easy to use and good value for the price.
4,Kwikset latch review,"We purchased these door handles and latches to replace the 'builder quality' items in our home. The new units were a perfect fit replacement including the doorframe cataches, latch mechanisms, and handle bezels. In fact, they worked better than the units they replaced- much more positive engagement, and handles were solid rather than hollow. It remains to be seen how well the plating will last, but initial impressions are very positive!"
1,quit workin,"This product was never real good,the sound was poor, it blew fuses, then stopped all together after two weeks. I have bought several of these because I like the simple design and easy operation."
1,doesn't work at all very fuzzy low sound,cheap piece of crap. doesn't work and it looks like something from the dollar store. save ur money and buy a real one that costs more.
2,Get what you,As I said... you get what you pay for .. Since my car antenna is about 8 feet from the cig lighter I have a feeling this is why this unit does not work to well. There is a lot of high frequency squealing and radio static associated with this device which can be heard over top of the music. I use the device to play my tunes from Blackberry over my auto radio. The connecting cord that comes with this device does not fit well into the standard mini receptacle on the Blackberry and i am sure it would not work any better on any MP3. It was cause for a lot of static and other noise. I actually bought a shielded cable with the proper fittings on the ends which helped to clean the sound up a lot. Unfortuantely it was about 2/3 of the price I paid for this unit. The unit is susceptible to many other electronic noises happening within the vehicle. I would suggest looking at other units and perhaps paying a bit more for a stronger device.
1,Complete crap,It's made so cheaply that I'm absolutely SHOCKED it even made it to my door in one piece.Broke within a couple days. Do not buy.
3,Excellent,"Excellent product! After trying many FM Modulators this is the best! A plus is you can load an SD Card or USB! (Original Review)I need to give some ""over time"" experience. Worked great for 3-4 months. Not sure why but it seemed to get fuzzier reception as time went on. After 6 months I bought an HD Radio with inputs and did not need it anymore so I put it away. Found it yesterday, it would turn on and try to get reception but could barely hear it. Good (not great) for a couple months. (Added 2/5/13)"
3,No Track Included,"There was no description of the item from the store when I purchased the James Accessory Train. My grandson loves Thomas and Friends, but already has an original Aquadoodle mat. When I found the James Accessory Train, I assumed that the track roller came with it and it could be used on the oringinal mat. I did not need to purchase the entire set with the track roller. The toy is great. Just a warning before you buy: the track roller is not included and cannot be purchased seperatly."
3,Where is the roller,I was one of those who assumed that the roller was included. I went to Toys r Us and there was not a roller to buy. I am glad that I read the post that said it worked on the regular mat with a drawn track. That helps with our dilemma but the roller pen should come with the train.
3,"Toy is great, disappointed in manufacturer","I also purchased this as a gift and thought the track pen was included. My son has the original mat, pens and stamps. He loves Thomas and thought it would be a nice addition. I was very disappointed to find out the track pen wasn't included and can't be purchased seperately. You have to purchase the Thomas set for $50 to get the pen! The set is still unavailble and it's the end of January. Spinmaster made a big mistake on this one!"
4,Bulgarian tracks,"Unlike modern productions, these recordings are not at all overproduced, maybe from the '50s. Very straightforward, rather village bands: brass, nice singing. Good clarinet and trumpet solos, wonderful baritones thundering along behind. Get this back in stock and I'll buy a bunch for my friends too."
1,Arcane,"I just started property class, and I've listened to this set a few times. So far, the CD's do not follow our text at all. The subjects do not seem to line up. I have bought all of the 1L Sum & Substance CD's and so far, this set has been the worst. Maybe things will get better once I get further into property. The speaker seems to get into excruciating middle age detail, which does not seem to go along w/ my course."
5,Christmas Gift,I purchased a custom branding iron for my brother for Christmas because he's been doing alot of woodwork lately and I thought it would be the perfect touch! I received it today and I am sooo happy!! It looks better then I ever thought it would! It comes in a sealed bag and coushined so that nothing would happen while shipping. Sooo pleased!! Just hope he likes it!
4,short shaft,Everything about the product is great except one big thing. It is far too short. The shaft should easily be a full foot longer so to fully extend it into a fire. It's almost as if noone bothered to actually use one in real world conditions.
3,Too hard for younger players,"My niece found the game too hard although it is geared for ""early childhood"". Although only 4 years old, other games like the Barbie Ocean and Pokemon were fine for her. This one was too frustrating."
3,Welcome to USA Hello Kitty,"It's about time they started releasing some of the Sanrio character video games here in the US. This is a fun, well done puzzle game. It starts out very easy and has an excellent tutorial. I fear it will quickly become too challenging for the younger gamers this title is aimed at. Seeing the other Sanrio characters (esp. bad bad Badtz Maru!) is a nice bonus."
4,Tasty,"This one is different, taste is good and the aroma is excellent. Prefer the blackberry, but am pleased with all the flavors I have tried."
4,Vicious Hateful Death Metal,"""Liber Zar Zax"" is the 3rd album from Holland's CENTURIAN. and it is a perfect blend of the intensity of the bands' 1st album and the heaviness of they're 2nd one. there are 11 tracks of brutal extreme metal on this cd that will pummel you. Centurian had they're own sound, the closest i can come to describing them to you is a mix of Marduk & Morbid Angel, only better maybe. as stated before, this is Centurians' 3rd album, and sadly for me it is also they're last album, they split up in 2002. i shall miss them greatly, horns up !!!"
2,"enough of the gimiky power supplies lets get back to quality, people, you know what we want!","as 700 watt ""bursting"" does not make a speaker good, 700 watt furnice stink power doesn't make a power supply good, the output is based on a efficency rating(usually 80+% is good or acceptable). the glowing inda-glo blu lights and high raw rating doesn't impress us anymore,(even gamers). we need the facts, that's it!(luckily amazon has an excellent retruns policy, YOU may not be so lucky elswhere). ascteticallly it is a pretty heater, and white noiser, nothing more."
1,700W??? Yeah right,"This doesn't deliver 700W, I was replacing a 425W power supply, and it could not provide enough power to power my equipment, although a 425W could. Not surprisingly the voltages were just barely in spec. I've had fans that got noisy after a while, but never out of the box before. This ships with a rattling fan. And as a bonus it has LED's that you could light a house with. Really lousy power supply, clear evidence that you get what you pay for."
2,Artists At Home,"I bought this book after reading about it in New Mexico Magazine. Some of the artists were featured in this springs issue of Artists Homes.The selection of artist were diverse and exciting. Their homes absolutely beautiful and inspiring. I was however very disappointed in the size of the book. My fault, I should have read all the details pertaining to the book. I just assumed this book would be much larger in size. The little more than six inch square left me frustrated and using a magnifying glass to try to see the details of the artists homes.The size of this book was a huge injustice to the artists and their lovely homes."
2,6 Pilot review,"While visually stunning, the corny dialog of near god like aviators and the romance of death and war killed the whole movie. Of the 5 pilots I watched this with, only 1 gave it 4 stars, everyone else gave it 2 or 3 (I gave it 2). Hugh Downs, the narrator, had to let you know within the first few minutes that he was a pilot and then in the next 60 minutes proceeded to do his best make flying sound like only exceptional people can fly."
3,"Very, very stiff material","Unfortunately, you cannot tell the quality of a fabric when purchasing it online but I was still very surprised at just how stiff this was when it arrived. I was hoping for something that would be durable but not so incredibly stiff. Thankfully, my daughter only needs to wear it once a week for 30 minutes during her lesson but I'm still dissapointed. It's not a bad product... I was just hoping for better quality. Also, I will say that the sizing chart posted for this is very helpful for those of us not familiar with the sizing system."
2,Costume was fair,"The cotume arived in great time. It was very cheaply made, the pink jacket was the only nice thing about the outfit."
3,OK metronome,"An OK metronome. Works precisely on good surface. Compact.Problem: you have to switch it to 92 or higher bmp before you can close it or stop it. If you want to practice at 80, make a stop and then resume, then you have to put it on side or stop in some other way, or lose your tempo setting and then restore it.Missing features:1. I'd like to see some way to detect if surface is not good enough and it will affect precision of ticks, and also some way of calibrating the metronome for these cases.2. Why not to print the tempo ranges on side (e.g. ""Largo 40-60"") and use the remaining space for longer scale (to go beyond 208 bmp)?3. I'd like to see a flip-top case instead of a cover as a separate piece. If compactness is a primary feature, why not to implement it in an even better way?"
2,Nice size,The size is very convenient but the pendulum does not give enough differentiation for the settings. A larger or electronic metronome is more efficient.
5,workhorse,"I like this metronome very much. It is VERY well made and sturdy. My only wish were that you could turn off the clicking sound so that you have only a visual. I didn't realize that was not a possibility, so I sometimes use the free metronome on my iPhone because it is silent, which is useful when recording."
1,"ENOUGH OF THESE ""HITS"" CDS ALREADY!","Holy moly, how many of these so called ""hits"" CDs do we need to be bombarded with. The Luther Vandross fanbase doesn't deserve to be bombarded with all these useless ""hits"" CDs. Real fans should completely ignore this CD as well as The Ultimate Luther Vandross, Always & Forever, pretty much all of his ""hits"" CDs except maybe 1997s Best Of Love Vol. 2. I suggest getting all of Luthers full-length studio albums and I say they should release a LIVE album or even a remix album, instead of just another ""hits"" CD. In fact I must say that this ""Very B.O. Love"" should go out of print, the same thing goes for Love Is On The Way as well as Super Hits.I love every song on but every one of these songs are on NUMEROUS other compilations and putting them on so many CDs diminishes their power.This CD is nothing but another failed attempt at cashing in on the fanbase. Avoid this! Just go and buy his regular full-length studio albums instead because they offer far more than this."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this product with high hopes that it would deliver as promised but alas I was severely disappointed. Both the Regular and Premium tunes caused my truck to have very poor performance over stock. The shift point and firmness settings made absolutely no difference whatsoever. The odometer correction for gears, tire sizes, top speed limiter and rev limiter are the only settings which functioned properly. I do like the drag strip, dyno, and gauge functions but not enough to pay a premium price. Deal or Dud you ask? Definitely a DUD!"
5,Fabulous book!,"What a wonderful book! It immediately transports you to another time and place. It is vividly written, and with so much humor I found myself laughing out loud. The voices of the characters are very distinctive. You find yourself liking and caring about them. Plus as you read, you are soaking up the beauty and history of Yellowstone. An intelligent, beautifully written story. It has been a long time that I have been able to lose (and enjoy) myself in a work of fiction."
2,Disappointing,Nice jacket cover..established well known publisher..my copy is in a second printing..Excellent reviews on back of book jacket..good Amazon reader reviews..so why is this book so awful?
2,Dippy - Why Should I Believe This?,"If only this author had included a preface or afterward explaining the basis for her fiction. Did she read real letters? Were there really such botanical missions? The main character's coy use of initials to hide her gender is too cute as is her ability to rescue a man in a snowstorm. The men in the book are without exception pains in the neck. I wanted to like this, but I couldn't believe in it, or lose myself in it as I did in Andrea Barrett's books of the same style. For a real trip to the 19th century west, read ""A Lady's Life in the Rockies."""
4,Voices from the 19th Century West,"Handed to me in passing in a hallway by a good ""book"" friend who said ""read it"", I did, and I wasn't disappointed. Mistaken for a a male scientist, A. E. (Alexandra) Bartram is accepted as a member of a Montana State College botany expedition into Yellowstone Park in 1899. The social barriers are eventually overcome and Alex becomes a strong contributing member of this scientific team. But the truly quality of this novel is that the entire story is told through the letters from Yellowstone written by various members of the expedition. There is plenty to write about from budding romance and predatory European nobility to 19th century feminism and the role of science in society. Despite a few lexicographic anachronisms the voices in the letters rang remarkably true. As a native Montanan the descriptions of Yellowstone were accurate and evocative. A great read! Now what should I pass back to my friend in the hallway?"
4,A great book for a summer vacation,"I read this book while vacationing in the Rockies and would have had a hard time finding a better read for the setting. Written as a selection of letters, the novel is easy to pick up to fill a few spare moments of leisure. The letters , written by several different characters in the novel, provide a clever way for the author to change perspectives on the same events. Like Andrea Barrett in Ship Fever and Voyage of the Narwhal, the author treats us to the themes of a woman's stuggle to fulfill her dreams in a man's world, as well as the proper role of science in society. Both the plot and characters are sometimes a bit too quaint, but readers of Jane Austen will find them enjoyable. The book is entertaining while provocative."
4,Nice instrumental piece...,"For those interested in a sampling of Byzantine music, this is a good start; it is all instrumental, and is played masterfully. However, being instrumental, it lacks the logic and beauty that only a rational human voice can project. Byzantine music is beautiful, but without understanding what is being chanted, it ultimately means nothing."
1,Incomplete is right...,"Well I guess I can't say this book is incomplete...since it's completely boring and completely glosses over every subject it contains. In one day of owning the book I jumped around and read the whole chapters on religion, economics, and american history and came away knowing nothing of substance. It would be more enteraining and more helpful just to go back and read school textbooks on these subjects. Which shows you how enjoyable this book is."
3,Very Textbook-y,"I had thought this book would be written in a very chatty, informative way that would be easy to read, similar to an Uncle John's Bathroom Reader, but it is very similar to a textbook in language. Very good source of information, but difficult to read."
1,Terrible Book,"Hard to use as a quick reference guide, filled with sarcastic anti-Bush comments, a complete turn off. Glad it only cost me less than $10. Waste of money, going to trash the book."
3,Good But Falls a Little Short,"I just spent the weekend perusing this book. I think there's a lot of great information, however it falls a little short of the mark in the music section. There is not one mention of jazz. How can you have a complete education without knowledge of one of the most influenctial art forms of the twentieth century? I applaud the authors for this huge undertaking. In the next edition they should include some information on jazz; in particular: George Gershwin, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane and Miles Davis.I would say that this book can best be used as a list of things to study further."
1,Disappointed,"""Should have learned"" is the key phrase in my review. Should have learned according to whose opinion is the question? This authors, apparently in order to sell books. I ordered this book, reviewed it and then returned it. It is packed with factual information, but 90% of it is irrelevant and you will never have the use for it. I am an elementary school teacher and I bought this to use as a reference for tid bits of information here and there to engage my students. There is nothing engaging about this book."
2,not very useful,"i was very dissapointed with the information in this book, it was a boring read as well."
2,Aptly titled in the wrong way...,"I was highly disappointed with the first edition - glaring omissions and inaccuracies abound. For example: Gerard Manley Hopkins is not even mentioned in the section concerning the British poets and in the chapter on religion, the authors make the boorish mistake of confusing the doctrine of the ""Immaculate Conception"" with that of the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ. It might seem trivial to some, but if you want to write a book purporting to illuminate such topics, you better be up to the task, especially when your style is on the snide and cynical side. Maybe corrections were made in later editions, but I wouldn't count on it. Certainly a better read for this purpose is ""A History of Knowledge: Past, Present, and Future"" by Charles Van Doren, which Amazon also stocks."
2,Disappointment,"I was so disappointed with this selection. Granted, I knew from the onset that this book was not the end-all book to learn everything in the universe. I was hoping for a serious look into some terrific topics I knew little or nothing about. Instead what I got was too much tongue-in-cheek. Too much sarcasm. Too many snide remarks that we readers can't even understand because we are not smart enough to be *in* on the joke. I found it condescending. I planned on buying another copy of this book for my best friend as a birthday present. I've changed my mind."
4,We all need something like this,"I bought this book because there are huge gaps in my education in matters such as US history, political science and economics, and for the most part I now feel more confident about my knowledge in these areas since I started reading this book. However, it seems more useful for people who learned what they should have learned, yet want to learn more. I suppose it might be a useful book for someone who's training for ""Jeopardy!"", or anyone else who is interested in becoming a more well-rounded and generally educated person, but it's not such a good replacement for having paid attention in school."
2,Poorly Written,"Hard to read, the author injects sloppy humor and anecdotes into the history. Making fun of historical figures, joking about religions and using sentences that are broken up by multiple parentheses.Too bad I didn't read the reviews before I spent the money....There is still some good info there but it's too much hassle to pick out the serious writing from the personal opinions"
2,An Incomplete Education,"Don't buy for Kindle. Probably a great read or reference in hard copy, but the chart format for some topics are not fully displayed on the Kindle screen. You cannot see the entire entry for some subjects in a section. Table of Contents is not searchable; you cannot navigate to a specific chapter heading - in a reference book? Previous favorable reviews were obviously referring to the hardcopy versions. I would recommend it for print-on-paper reference reading, but not for Kindle users. How do I get a refund?"
3,Could use but could do without,"Yes there is a tremedous amount of information in the book, large and heavy. The articles are written in an almost sarcastic way, not straightforward, which would work best for me. It won't be used in the manner I had hoped, and contrary to what others have included in their reviews, it won't be given as gifts to others."
3,"Great read, easily digested","It's a great volume, and thoroughly interesting. Basically short reviews across a number of subjects, heavy on the history and art. It's probably a reading level above a ""Dummies"" summary, but still not difficult to digest on the go."
5,"An Incomplete Education: 3,684 Things You Should Have Learned but Probably Didn't","Wow! What fun. While I bought this book to fill in some gaps in my education, it never occured to me such a book could be so compelling. It fulfills the promise of its title, but when you put it down, you will find yourself going back to read more. You'll expand your horizon, get the facts and enjoy doing it. Share it with your family.Have a good read,Diana M."
1,Very Disappointing,"This work is terrible - the string of inside jokes and parenthetical statements are so outdated that it makes for very distracted reading. Written in long winded sentences in the second person, the authors come across with a pretentious ""I know all about YOU"" attitude that rarely hits the mark (""Fortunately, you have cable - and a Stouffer's lasagna in the freezer""...um, no, I don't). While the goal is a noble one, the authors fail to follow through with the golden rule of writing: ""love the reader."" If they had written in a clear, thoughtful style, this work would have gained a 5 star rating."
1,Kindle version has mismatched photos and captions,"The physical book is wonderful and I recommend it. My rating specifically applies to the Kindle version, which has many mismatched photos and captions. For example, the caption ""Washington Irving's house"" appears beneath a picture of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Ridiculous."
1,Too bad.,"Well, I was really looking forward to it, and read a fair portion of the Religion section, but found the tone of it really annoying, not enough depth on the subject, and the author makes too many inside jokes. If you get the jokes, you already know the information and you don't need to read it. If you don't get the jokes, it is leaves you as an outsider and learn nothing.I'll keep reading it, and amend the review if I have to.My advice:Go to Barnes & Noble and take a look (and just to be fair to our host, consider ordering it from here). If you read a section, and enjoy it, buy it. If it is offputting like it was to me, don't."
2,Very Disappointing,"As someone who has read and loved history for many decades, I thought this book would make a great addition to my collection, but I was very disappointed. Much of the information is piece-meal and incomplete, just enticing the reader a bit and then leaving them wondering where the rest of the story is. I was also surprised by the frequent and glaring anti-conservative messages, which were often unrelated to the topics being discussed. I understand that historians are human and have political leanings, but in this book too much opinion tainted the historical message. I was hoping for an informative new take on the topics included, and as I say, I was disappointed.Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything is a much better read."
2,"An 'incomplete education' after reading ""An Incomplete Education""","Topic coverage is all too, too cutsey. Trades humor for viable information. Entertains rather than educates. Want simple useful information? Purchase an elementary textbook on the subject and you will come away better informed."
5,A great gift item,"I purchased one for my husband who loved it. It is a general overview of many topics and is as much fun as it is educational.I will be purchasing 3 more as Christmas gifts for those on my list who ""have everything."""
4,Great Source of Knowledge,"I thouroughly enjoyed the entire book. Every chapter captures your interest and simply envelpes your mind. Many, and I mean many, Americans simply do not realize how far science has come in terms of life extension and eventually life unlimited. This books opens your eyes to alot of new frontiers that are already in our midst. It shares with the reader the up-to-date reviews of experiments currently underway, such as organ regeneration, telomere shortening and others dealing mainly with aging. The author concludes the book with his interpretation of what might, and in all reality could possibly, happen to our world as we know it if immortality was possible. Bottom line is its a great book that will keep you hanging on every line and leave you wanting to know more. ""The more you read, the less you know."""
3,"interesting, but not practice-able","The book does contain nice clear drawings of the relevant meridians and a good introduction to chi kung, but I think it would take a determined person to perform the described practices from the text. The author does state clearly that it is not his intention that people be able to practice from this book without other instruction, however through no fault of the authors that information is not presented on the amazon.com page with the book description.I think this would be very useful as a reference to someone who has taken classes and seen the techniques, otherwise I would not recommend it."
3,same old stuff,"There are a lot of other books on the SS, and this is mostly just a rehash of the same old material you will find there, but this is no where as comprehensive as the others. The only distinction is this book includes some material on SS activity in France, but only a tiny bit. Despite the title, there is actually very little detail about the Gestapo. Like the other books on the SS, the narrative is mostly just a listing of familiar names and dates and events rather than a full-blown account. The translation from the original French is very good however; the prose style sparkles."
4,Interesting reading of the inner workings of this organization,Much detail about how the Gestapo actually was founded and the complex way in which it operated. Includes the names and short biographies of almost all the Nazi bigwigs that ran it. Some unknown details about the aftermath when Nazi Germany capitulated to the Allies and before the Nuremberg Trials began. A good book for those who make a study of this Nazi interlude in human history.
4,The Gestapo,"The book contains many fact that I had not none. It is surprising where many of these came to light. It is very detailed and well researched. The back biting in the regime was always know known and is confirmed in this book. All in all it was a book which was hard to put down. Looking back at the horror, it is difficult to believe that this could happen in the las century."
2,Recycled Text in a New Format,"While the topic is of great interest the authors have stretched their resources in attempting to build a comprehensive guide to the underground railroad in Washington County, Ohio. The book begins by showing over 22 photos of riverbanks and trees. This repetition quickly snuffs out the interest the reader has on the topic. Much of the following information has been printed time and time again in newspapers and other underground railroad texts. The text and photography do not come up to the standard of Mr. Burke's earlier works and unfortunately do not do him justice."
2,you get what you pay for,"Cheap,cheesy and flimsy this fixture will grace my garage bays when I replace it with something more substantial. Brass plating looks fake and arms are easily moved so that it looks crooked all the time.Expect to pay more for something nice."
5,Great Novels,"Eugenia Price's novel mix real life characters and real history with fictional stories. This make it very real, and quickly engages the reader. I have been to some of the locations in Savannah GA, and I have used the book as a guide.I recommend these novels to history lovers."
4,book bright captivity,Book was in good shape and arrived quicker than I expected. I was very pleased.
4,"Crikey, it really does work on those sore upper back muscles","I store a lot of stress in my upper back, and although exercising and regular massages really help. This dvd really helps you target those sore areas! I really mean target. The yoga moves ,although repeated several times, target specific muscles by stretching and tensing the muscle groups; and boy did I feel a release of the locked energy immediately. dont be surprised if your back is a little sore the next day - it is a good thing.the DVD is broken up to five parts; if you are into instructions and have not done yoga before - you will find these segments very useful. For those who are yogis then I would suggest jumping right into the last segments that target the upper back, shoulders and neck either for release or for muscle strenghtening.This is unlike any other yoga dvds that I have ever tried. I cant wait to try the hip and lower back one now."
2,Ouch. Hard on knees for me,"Tried it, hurt my knees. Knee really. That stupid child's pose and couldn't figure out a way around standing on knees (left knee has issues). Gary's voice a bit grating, but could have overlooked if I'd been able to do it. Others clearly love it. I don't."
3,Extremely Gentle--Almost Too Much So,"Perhaps this DVD is geared towards those in lesser physical shape, but for me this DVD was too gentle. I did find my muscles weren't as tight after the neck and shoulder routine, but I craved a deeper stretch for the majority of the routine. I have several other more powerful yoga DVDs I use for fitness, so my take on it might be altered. This DVD may still be good for those new to yoga."
4,"Solid, therapeutic DVD","I injured my back in my 20s and have had troubles with my left lower back ever since (for about 25 years). Once I started practicing yoga on a regular basis 3 to 4 years ago, my symptoms started improving to the point that I don't have constant pain and can go for months without any significant symptoms. Occasionally I've had neck/shoulder/sternocleidomastoid sprains from overexercising. The tapes in these series are done by physical therapists who specialize in spinal pain. They are thorough and professional. I recommend them for anyone looking for an alternative to other pain relieving options for the spine. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star rating is because they are a bit on the boring side and don't have music like Rodney Yee DVDs (He's my favorite yoga instructor)."
2,Use caution before buying this DVD.,"I would recommend a slower-paced, more gentle DVD if you are new to yoga, are older, are not as limber, and/or have painful joints (like knee pain with kneeling.) While the instruction and explanation is good, the actual work-out is fairly quickly paced. If you hurry and do the positions without doing them properly for your body, you will end up possibly injuring yourself. Although I am older I have exercised most of my life, yet both of the Kraftstow DVD's were difficult for me. I was disappointed to pay almost $50 for both of them, which I can only return for a partial refund. If you do buy them, I would say get a used one for less to see if you like it first."
5,Great low impact strengthening!,"Love this video! After sitting at a computer all day, it is great to come home and give my back some love!Totally recommend it for relieving the stress we all carry in our shoulders and back too!"
5,Great video!!!,"I purchased the Viniyoga therapy for back, neck and shoulders because I have chronic pain in that area.I was excited to see such a video existed. I really love it. It's easy to follow and to do the poses. I feel great when I am done. My doctor has recommended yoga for me everyday to minimize my pain. I will use this specific video along with a general yoga video."
5,Helping my back,I have been using this DVD for about a month. I do ultrasound and had severe pain on the right from my back through shoulder and arm. I have found much relief if I consistently do at least a 20 minute segment. I purchased the upper and lower back package together because I have problems in all areas. I alternate and many of the exercises are similar in both with some more specific to the upper or lower. What I like is that he prompts every move including breathing and the movement. The movements are slow so I can keep up with them. One would think that slow doesn't work but I'm starting to feel more flexibility and less pain and I'm seeing more definition in my stomach muscles. I like variety so having the 2 DVDs with 3 sessions in each is good although many of the movements are similar. There is also a segment that describes each movement and proper position. I look forward to doing these and feel that I need to do them or I feel more pain.
2,Yoga Therapy,I found the material in this yoga dvd to be choppy and hard to follow. Waste of money for me. Was delivered in a timely manner.
5,Everyone should own.,"I will admit I should use this video more often...but it definitely stretches your back. Easy, explained well, relaxing, and highly recommend purchasing it."
3,GOOD BUT BORING,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD IN ORDER TO HAVE SOME THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE FOR FUTURE ,WHEN,MAYBE,I WILL HAVE TO SLOW DOWN. AND SO IT IS. THE DVD IS VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE REASONS THAT CAUSE OUR PAINS, BUT I KNOW THEM ALREADY, GARY KRFTSOW IS VERY CORRECT AND HIS PERFORMERS ARE REAL PEOPLE, NOT TOO GOOD LOOKING, I LIKED THIS, BUT THERE IS NOTHING SPIRITUAL THERE. I LIKE YOGA FOR IT'S SPIRITUALITY,IT'S SOUL, IT'S DELIGHTFUL SATISFACTION. THESE ARE ABSENT HERE. WHOEVER LOOKS FOR VERY NICE PHYSIOTHERAPY , WILL FIND IT HERE. AND YES , IT REALLY HELPS BACKPAIN."
3,"Okay but overpriced, better off getting a book at library","I thought this was well put together, but it was overpriced and I would of rather gone to the library to get a Yoga book instead. I paid $28, and it was probably worth 12-15. Some of the poses are ridiculuous as you have to be Gumby to perform them."
3,Interesting piece of literary history,"""Rachel Dyer"" was written in 1828 by John Neal, a native Mainer who had trained to be a lawyer.Fictionalized account of Salem witch trials with hanging victim Rev. George Burroughs portrayedas an action/adventure hero: part Daniel Webster, part Paul Bunyan, part Don Juan, part martyred saint.Difficult to follow as the story contains little to no punctuation. Notable however,for Neal's heroic attemptto write all the dialog in the vernacular (probably the first example of that in American fiction.)"
3,Classic Novel but no primary historic materials,"The author takes us through some of the victims lives in this 19th century novel as they become targets of the witchcraft tribunals. Somewhat stilted dialog but not unexpected for the period in which the book was written. Nonetheless, the novel remains a literary classsic."
3,better than most,"I was very impressed with the disk. Really catchy songs, good production, good players. The only negative is the singing. I could see them getting really popular with a better singer."
5,Oh So Pretty!!!,"I have these Nina's in lime green and multi-pastel and get just as many compliments on one as I do the other. They look great with capris, long skirts, and even shorts. Really pretty to show off a great summer pedicure."
3,Looks Good - Juices Good,Looks nice and juices fine for home use. The drip spout clip bent the first week but stainless seed tray and other plastic parts look like they will hold up.Looks real nice but is it better than my Oster Juicer that I have used several years and was 1/2 the price/ Humm?
2,Good but not the same,"This new 60 minute DVD is a good summary and update from DR John Gray. However, it does not compare with the VHS Completed edition. Hopefully A DVD version of ""men are from mars, women are from venus"" will be available in the near future. Having a fully transfered VHS to DVD version would be so much more helpful. Plus nothing would be ommitted from the original.PaulColorado Springs, CO"
5,Finally Someone Tells Bob's Story!,"I have to say I am SO happy to see someone tell Bob's story and bring to life the credibility and praise that he so righteously earned. Having been a loyal fan of folk music since it's early days, I have known how much influence he has had on the evolution of folk music throughout the sixties, seventies, and even today. Yet I have been consistently amazed at how many people are not aware of this. We hear all about Peter, Paul & Mary, Joan Baez, and other household names, but Bob's name goes largely unrecognized, even though he personally influenced all of these people...a fact which is frequently made evident by the many contributions to this book by other artists. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone with an appreciation of folk music, whether you know of Bob Gibson or not, you will wonder why someone didnt write this book sooner."
5,The Fast Lane On The Information Superhighway,"Madelene Sobal's ""You've Got Male"" is ""must read"" for anyone who's contemplated meeting people on the Internet. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll even blush (at least I did!)as she describes the exciting new world of dating online.While the book is written from a woman's perspective, every man with a computer needs to read it, too. Trust me on this one, folks! If you've ever even thought about entering an Internet chat room, you'll want to read ""You've Got Male"" first. The heading on the back cover says it all -- ""Men watch out! Women take heed . . .""Using her skills as a relationship counselor, Madelene also deals with the human side of online relationship and offers a great of advice that will help out whether you met your current love interest online or at a church social. But most of all, this book deals with life, love and relationships -- a combination that always guarantees a great book!"
3,"How to get Laid, Online","This book is a confusing mixture of self help, how to, and erotica. The author gives advice like ""don't sleep with a man on the first date"" and then gives the graphic details of how she ignores her own advice. The sex comes off as padding for what would have been a much slimmer volume, but it is occaisionally kind of hot, in a sleazy, Penthouse letters fashion."
1,I am terrified!,"I feel extremely sorry for the author. She has been through alot of pain. If I did not know other couples who had met successfully through the Internet, I would absolutely, positively never attempt to meet anyone on line after reading this book. I would be devastated to have even one of the experiences that the author had. It will take me quite some time to recover from reading this book. Hopefully, I will be able to gain the courage to attempt to reach out in Cyberspace after this! This was not a helpful book about how to find love on line. This was an extremely painful account of how one woman has been abandoned, humiliated and abused by men that she happened to meet on-line. She is a relationship counselor! What about her relationship with herself? I did not find the book educational. I found it terrifying and painful!"
3,Not the only Internet Dating Game in town,"I think the first reviewer pretty much nailed it describing this book. My biggest beef is that the name infringes on my game show, The Internet Dating Game . Net, where people can actually play a dating game on their home computer and win dates with studio contestants."
4,A.I. siggy boardshort is sickey,They look sick. Comfortable. you look cool while wearin them if you can surf at all. downside: too trendy. too many kooks from Beantown and AZ rock em with their birkenstocks and puka shells.
5,THIS cd ROCKS,"eVERY SONG ON THIS DISC SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE A SINGLE/HIT.tO BE HONEST, i DON'T KNOW WHY THIS GUY ISN'T A STAR YET.iT REMINDS ME OF u2 A LITTLE IN MANY WAYS. i THOUGHT WHEN I FIRST HEARD IT THAT IT WAS A u2 ALBUM.5 STAR RATING MY FRIENDS"
4,Awesome amp for the wallet sensitive individual,I am never comfortable buying cheap but thought I would give it a try. I am impressed for the twenty some bucks this cost. Its pushing my speakers more then adequately for 250 W Peak. For someone on the cheap this is a well made visually attractive product.
5,"Informative, yet easy to understand.","This is the best introductory book to phenomenology because it's somewhat like an encycolpedia of phenomenology and more importantly is that the book is written in colloquial language. Since it's very informative yet easy to understand, it really helps readers in future readings.The book can also be used as a reference, not only as an introduction."
4,Relaxing,"I received this as an Easter gift from my parents and I was eager to listen to it. I had totally loved AJ's first CD and was hoping this one was just as good.It met my expectations. I loved her voice and the acoustic melody, and the lacing of the journal entries between tracks. However, this CD is not really for those who don't much like acoustic. My mom heard me listening to it and called it ""mood music"", which is true. Amy Jo is also one of those people you have to listen to a few times before you can truly appreciate her, but after you do you're hooked. Her voice is like nothing I've ever listened to before, and it's certainly mesmerizing."
3,"Dreiser On Dreiser Is Still Dry, Sir.","Although he published this volume (second after Newspaper Days, chronologically), Dreiser intended Dawn to be the first of four autobiographies, each covering approximately 20 years of his life. This confirms Dreiser's ambition, but doesn't place this book in the prize category of great autobiographical works. For all of his professed candor, Dreiser still skirts personal truths for the protocol, and his sentences wind and ramble and repeat like an electric train on contorted tracks.If you liked Sister Carrie and some of his other longer fictions, this extra reading may be helpful, but if you want to go for the ""red meat"" of Dreiser's life, I'd encourage a reading of his American Notebooks--his journals, published after his death and never really intended for publication. In them, boy oh boy, does the real Dreiser sans facade emerge."
2,Not for beginners,"I purchased this book while in College and attempted to use it several times to program in RPG, however, the lack of extensive examples and the lack of explaination towards older RPG code has caused me to look for something more useful. I had a lot of trouble trying to learn from this book, althought it may be ok as a reference."
2,Where is Spoonful??,What's here is fine but how can any Cream compilation exclude Spoonful from their first album?? Perhaps their finest moment nowhere to be found. Its a crime! I know there is an ok live version here but it is inexcusable not to include the studio version. Who is the idiot who puts together these ridiculous compilations anyway? Obviously not a Cream fan! Should be fired!!!!!!
1,Sucks for the same reason the rest of them do.,"I can no longer read (a problem seemingly shared by the help department) RE download or open any of my books, including on the kindle I had for 3 months before it stopped working."
5,Bravo for Howard Jonas,A succesful business tycoon with a penchant for philosophy reveals in entertaining and readable prose how the wisdom of the past can be harnessed to meet todays challenges. Bravo and five stars for a masterpiece.
4,it is good ----But,"The 12"" White Round Grill was want I wanted, but, I was surprised that it did not include any screws to attach it."
1,11:11...or don't you have better things to do?,"Read it....regretted it. The authors obviously are 4 aging immature science fiction/horror fans who need to move out of their parent's basements, stop feeling sorry for themselves and face the adult world. The 11:11?!? RIGHT! OH YEA! RIGHT! *COUGH* My advice....save your pocket money for a Happy Meal and be nice to the McDonald's employee as they might be one of the authors!"
1,2 2 2 much!,"I will never feel the same about my digital clock again. Some judicious work with the wite out now means the clock will never show a one again. Stupid I know, but about on a par with the idea behind this book. The stories display a paranoia for the mundane which skew events that are as surprising as the force of gravity and impart a paranormal spin that would leave most rational people totally unmoved. A poor attempt at the x files genre, if I was grading it I think it would go in my E files. Not worth the read. I am going back to watch paint dry"
1,"Since There Is No ""0"" Star Rating...","...i just gave it a single star. This book was horrible in the very sense of the word. the fact that it is about the apocalypse just makes it about two years late for the supposed ""Event"" it speaks of. Another sad fact is that the authors are 4 grown adults, two of which are university professors, running around worrying about the end of the world. In the words of JJ, the ""J"" in ""MOJO"": ""We are all amazed by the numbers 11:11"" well, i'm not amazed by this phenomonon. i'm actually rather bored by it. there are no decent stories in this book, not a single one. the stories ranged from somebody walking around contemplating suicide, to an asinine one about a World War II veteran who was bit by a german werewolf! Do yourself a favor and skip this book, it's 90 minutes of your life you can never get back...."
1,al13 was right,...it was a horrible book. The stories were pointless and some had nothing to do with 11:11...it's 2 hours I can never take back...DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!!!
4,A Thought Provoking Read,"I found this collection of short stories to be an enjoyable, thought-provoking read that touched on many issues and situations that everyone can relate to, such as: insecurity and the loss of love in ""Beener;"" despairation in ""If At First;"" hypocracy in ""Whatsoever You Do;"" family troubles in ""Bittersweet Ending;"" and hidden secrets in ""Ashes."" Although this collection is mainly science fiction, it will be enjoyed by all readers since it touches on so many elements of human life. And as the title reflects, in each of the stories the number 11, 111 or 1111 is present. Sometimes the numbers don't play a major role, but the occurances in the stories mirror the same occurances the authors seem to experience, which makes finding the 1111 in each story as fun as finding the director cameo in a Hitchcock film. It's a diverse collection with something for everyone, particularly the Science Fiction fan."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!,"This book was absolutly terrible! I consider myself to be an avid reader and have read some pretty bad stuff, but this is by far one of, if not THE worst book I have ever read! I had to sit thru JJ Sargent in my writing class at college and hear him preach about how good of a writer he is! I should have known not to read it based on his admitting he had a part in writing it(He is the ""J"" in MOJO). But I plunged ahead and now regret doing so. To anybody who wants to read this book: find something else to do with your time, anything would be better. Even fans of the sci-fi genre would be hardpressed to enjoy this."
3,A great collection of CT fiction! I was pleasantly surprised,"I found the stories intriguing. Let's face it, these people are not Stephen King, but they sure have a unique perspective and imaginations that are inspired. I have no doubt that they will one day all be well-known.Stories that stood out for me included ""Stanley Thorton and the Three-Legged Dog,"" (reminded me of Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes, but I don't know why) ""Retropolis"" (very much like a Bradbury story) and ""Whatsoever You Do"" (could Christopher Lee star in the film?). Some of the others that stood out were Olson's stories about her friends CeCe and Sue who fought for self-identity and love in a dark world of drug addiction and carnival folk.I still don't know what 1111 means after reading this book. But that is part of the experience. I don't think that there are any answers."
1,Non Event,As the title suggests I found this book a non event and for something that was presumably written by English masters etc a waste of time and effort. I enjoy fantasy and sci fi but this was really wimpy.I was told not to waste my time by a friend and she was right!

2,Odd failure mode (after a year's use),I've had the HK3380 for about a year and generally liked it but I've had an intermittent failure of the low power side (all inputs). They (including the line outputs) will drop out for a few seconds to a few minutes. This happens once in a while but when it starts happening it keeps doing it for an hour or so. This unit is heading for the local electronics recycler and I'm looking for a new (non-HK) unit.
2,Programed Obsolescence?,"Good receiver--decent sound--the remote is a bit antediluvian, but about a day after the warranty was up the receiver started going into 'protect' mode the moment I would turn it on--shutting itself off before I could adjust anything--apparently a short problem in one or more of the primary amp IC's--commonly reported on the internet. The repair would cost more than half the price i paid for the receiver."
1,POS,This receiver is the best boat anchor that a man can have. It grabs the ocean floor and keeps the boat from moving. The person I bought this from is a scammer.Dial for tuning is cheap and sound quality is terrible. Go with Yamaha instead.
5,wow,"i bought the harmon kardon 3480 because my 22yr old pioneer died and the 3480 sounded good but i made one mistake i didn,t get new speakers. when i hooked up the 3480 and turned it on bang that was a wake up call so i ordered some new speakers and wow this receiver put out such clear sounds and also brings in all the fm stations i couldn,t get before and my c/ds play so great i just sit mesmerized by the sound."
2,HK 3480 with quality control problems,"I bought a 3480 about six months ago, and almost as soon as I hooked it up, it began making dreadful noises, and the ""protect"" light would come on. I fixed it partially byunscrewing the cover cases a great deal, but frequently it didn't want to start. With sufficient banging on the side, however, it would eventually start, with noises.I got tired of this behavior (it was nearing speaker-damaging levels) and got a 3380, which, as it turns out is in pretty much the same case, and, for my purposes (classical stuff) works just as well for a hundred bucks less.Perhaps this problem is unique to me. I suppose I could have sent it back, but I thought $199 was worth it to fixthe problem. The 3380 works perfectly (so far!)Jerry O'Dell"
2,HK3480 - Not thrilled !!!!,"First off, Since I bought this receiver, whenever you turn on the power or switch either the A or B speakers theres a static pop from the right channel. Though it hasn't gotten any worse it's annoying. The remote sucks big time, an idiot must have designed it. The preset stations are NOT next to the volume, their in the middle of the clump of other buttons, Absolutely STUPID!!!!! Next, you can adjust the brightness of the display on the receiver from the remote from the comfort of your chair but if you want to adjust the bass, treble or balance you have to get up and go to the receiver!!!! How FREAKIN stupid is that !!!!!! One thing I will give this receiver is it's clean sound. It's clean at any volume though I wish it had the bass punch my old Pioneer gave me."
4,Sounds good to me,"The sound is definitely cleaner, reveals more detail, and is more exciting to listen to than the old $150 Technics receiver I had--and at $280 it doesn't seem too pricey. I don't have anything else to compare it to so take take this review for what it is worth.On the downside -- the thing seems unnecessarily large, but you know that going in."
2,sending it back -- defective -- poor support,"Handsome unit, but remote is defective, which had the positive effect of informing me of just how remote dependent it is. For example, there is no way to preset the FM stations w/o the remote! Lose the remote, or like me get a defective one and many functions are crippled. Also, HK's customer service/technical support sucks. They still have not responded to my fax which complied in all respects to the requirements spelled out on their pre-recorded 800 number -- no humans!Even if it worked, the remote has a very cheap feel -- when the sliding cover is opened it is loose, rattles and feels like it is going to fall offAnother feature I don't like is the freewheeling volume control. To turn the volume way down or up, it takes many spins of the knob. And, since the knob freewheels, there is no easy visual reference as to the volume setting; for this you are dependent on the db display, which goes out shortly after the volume is adjusted."
4,"Impressive receiver, so-so remote","The receiver handles all kinds of music with clarity and power. I live about 50 miles from most FM stations I listen to, and the receiver is sensitive enough to bring most of them in with just the wire antenna. The remote did not work when delivered. I contacted Harman Kardon and the customer rep sent another one to me. It works, but the keys are small and the colors of the keys, labels, and basic unit make using it harder than I would like."
4,Very Pleased,"This is an incredible unit for the price (purchased for under $300). Replaced my old Sony receiver and hooked up my iPod to the CD input. The sound was amazing, full and clear coming out of my mid grade JBL bookshelf speakers (can't wait to actually hook up a CD player!). The unit is also very attractive which is important as it will be out for display, the glow on the volume knob is very cool.I agree with the other reviewers that the Vmax is a waste, if you're buying this unit, you're purchasing for the best stereo sound, if you want cool effects for your music, buy a surround sound receiver, they'll have much more options.I had been looking at the Onkyo and Denon stereo receivers in this price range and decided to go with the HK, because the Onkyo does not have a subwoofer hookup (huge drawback) and the Denon was much more expensive with less power."
2,"Starts out well, all down hill from there","The blurb on the back of the book is totally misleading. There is hardly any supernatural aspect, or any menage a trois with the PA, and theending is like something straight out of a really bad Harlequin/Mills and Boon romance. the interesting characters are tidied out of the way and the dominant Nicholas does nothing but have her hobble around with her kickers around her knees. Even worse is the fact that the author breaks the basic rules of show, not tell, by having the heroine Christabel recall the events after they have already happened rather than lead up to them and then follow through...I say she should have run away with Gussie, or her brother, and dumped Nicholas with his PA Jamie.Totally lacks heat and spice. I hope Black Lace titles pick up soon, as I am going through a drought of good books to read!"
1,Supremely Horrible,"Portia Da Costa is renowned as one of the best authors that publishes under the Black Lace label; however I have yet to figure out why either she or her editor did not stop this story from being published. I have owned this novel for a while now and have yet to finish it. Shadowplay starts off with a enticing introduction to the intriguing and extremely erotic Christabel. Unfortunatly, after the first few pages, the characters, including Christabel become extremely flat, one sided, and appear to be controlled by some unseen director offstage, as though they were all characters in a bad play. Seriously ladies, don't waste your time, or money on this novel. The Black Lace label is poorly represented with this publication. Find a novel by Emma Holly, or pick up one of the Wicked Words Short Story collections to see a much more erotic presentation that is truely what Black Lace is all about."
2,Works,"This came with great step by step directions on how to program the my truck. But the range on this leaves much to be desired. i have to be about 5 to 10 feet away from my truck to get it to work. not bad, but I thought the range would be better."
2,Mildly Humorous-Not funny,The Bush singers are somewhat amusing but the over-produced 60s' style harmonies can get old after a couple of songs
5,Worth the Read,This book is pure escapism. It's a great read on a plane or on vacation. I give it 5 stars and recommend it highly.
4,A Cute Valentine Book!,I bought this book for my 2 year old to help her understand the whole Valentine concept and she really enjoys this book! The illustrations are darling and the story is really cute! Since she's a little young for it I improvise on the words. :) Cute book!
4,The Night Before Valentine's Day,This book arrived in good time but I cannot remember the date. The packaging was OK. The take off theme from The Night Before Christmas sounded like a good idea. The reviews for it were good saying it was fun for children to read or have read to them. I know the author has written many other books on this theme. I gave it to our church bookstore. I do not know if anybody purchased it for their child or relative.CU
5,holiday books,"All the Natasha Wing books that are ""The Night Before..."" holiday books are WONDERFUL! Children love them and adults enjoy reading them to their children."
2,Is it possible to create more unlikable characters?,"I have to agree with another reader here - you cannot find a more tiresome couple than Cressida and Rossiter. Actually, I use the term ""couple"" loosely since you really rarely see them together and when you do, they are fighting. If this were a contemporary romance I would give the marriage a year, but since this is a Regency Romance, I forsee years of a hellish marriage ahead of them.I have read many Clare Darcy novels that I love but unfortunately, this is not one of them. Probably the book's worst fault is that Cressida is one of the most unlikable heroines I have ever read about. She is stupid, snobbish, pretentious, and shallow. I do not recommend this book."

4,Nice piece at a nice price...,"My last 4-piece multi-cooker (another brand from another store) did not hold up--the base separated from the stock pot. This one has held up well so far. Seems like quality construction, and I love the convenience of both the strainer for pasta and the steamer basket for fish or veggies. Can't beat the price!"
4,multi-function cooker for small family,"This 8-quarter, stainless steel cooker has just appropriate size of a family of 2 or 3.It is a useful long-lasting utisile"
2,It burns!,"Did everything on the instructions, still got a chemical burn (lasted a little less than a day), and it didn't even get rid of all the hair. Only saw a 50% hair loss, if that. Not worth it. I'm tossing this out and keeping my razors!"
4,PLEASE NOTE,"There are four stories in this anthology. A couple are excellent and a couple are not. But the main thing you should know is that it is an reissue. Another one I bought because there was not a review of it. I simply saw that it was by Jo Beverly and bought it. I realized I already had it when it came and I started to read it. It has a new cover, but the same stories."
5,A Wonderful Book,"From the beginning you know this is going to be a tear jerker, but it is a quick easy read. The writing flowed and seemed to be quite accurate in it's portrayal of Marines from the Marines I know. This is a good book for every American to read. Corporal Dunham is very special and it is important to remember that many of our service members will make that sacrifice if called upon. For that same reason it's difficult to read knowing that during this war we have lost so many special sons, friends, and loved ones. Semper Fi."
4,A powerful biography of the grunts who fight a war,"A well reported and written book that is conscise, poingnat and powerful. It takes us briefly into the lives of the Marines of one unit. It details where they came from and how they came together in a desert town in Iraq and most importantly how one brief moment in time - and one Marines gut reaction to protect the Marines next to him - changed all their lives.A very good read."
5,Authentic and moving,"An apolitical and moving account of selflessness by soldiers at risk in the service of others.Excellent read for those with a sound-bite view of war/s (whether for or against or in between).Kudos to a talented, brave writer who cares (and who is in his fifth tour embedded in a war zone)."
5,Gift of Valor,"This book is remarkable. My husband, DT1(SW/FMF) Christopher Graham, is mentioned in this book due to his heroic actions in trying to save CPL Jason Dunham. I thank the author for putting real life actions into a book that marks a place in history for all Americans. This book is highly recommended by my family!"
3,Honors One U.S. Marine Who Represents All U.S. Marines,"A quick read that will help the family of this fallen Marine heal their pain. Would be a good basis for a course or discussion or analyis of how wishful thinking and hope by well meaning people falls short when they lose sight of the realities of the situation and circumstances. None of which takes anything away from the valient heart of Medal of Honor recipient Corporal Jason Dunham, USMC."
5,Such a Good Book,This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. This is the first book I have read by Lynn Kurland and I am now hooked. I highly recommend reading this book.
2,Adequate but disappointing romance,"Well, this is the last Kurland book I read and, based on her others, I expected it to be another one which made me laugh and want to immediately reread it. What a disappoinment! I was pleased to see Jamie and Beth return, as well as the others. And I do like Alex very much and think that Ms. Kurland does an excellent job of writing about men as well as women. However, Meg was such an annoying heroine in this book that I often wondered why Alex even wanted to be with her! It seemed as if she went to extremes to be something Elizabeth wasn't -- very tough and rugged, annoying in questioning everything, and definitely one with little patience. Many of these basic characteristics are an inherent part of Beth, but somehow they are excerbated in Meg to the point that I threw the book away! Not even Jamie and Beth could make we want to reread this. What a shame -- and what a difference from the other Kurland romances!"
1,disappointed,"I was very turned off by this book. The dialogue was so flat - just like a TV sit com. There was hardly any description that was compelling. The relationship was flat so there was not even a spark of romance in it. The only redeeming thing was the story line. At least it kept me reading. I love the subject matter and the story, too bad it was ruined by the writing style."
5,Never disappoints! Terrific read!,"All of Kurland's novels are fantastic, especially her newest one. The best thing about Kurland is that her story lines never get too complicated (no confusing twists and turns and twists and turns, etc.), and they always make for a light, amusing read. The relationships are believable and all of the characters are interesting. In 'The Very Thought...', the relationship between Alex and Margaret is sweet and touching. Baldric the Bard is hilarious. It was refreshing to have a heroine like Meg who wears chain-mail and who could best any man in a jousting contest. And all Alex wants to do is get to sunny Barbados, then woo his younger brother's girl friend. It was also great to see Jamie and Elizabeth again. If you're in the mood for a heart warming novel, this is the book for you! Keep them coming Lynn!!"
2,Disappointing and dull,"I bought this book after reading all these great reviews, so I was completely stunned when it turned out to be a real snooze. It has a great premise, but nothing really happens. The heroine & hero are flat and uninteresting. The dialog is windy and boring. Their romance is bland, inactive, uninspiring, and sloooowww. No spark. A missed opportunity. I tried very hard to stick with it but had to resort to skimming about 1/2 way through. Can't recommend."
4,"Exciting, funny and sensual without sleaze.","I usually stay away from romance novels told from the male point of view, but this was delightfully funny; I really enjoyed being inside Alex's head throughout these adventures. I enjoyed Meg's strength and found the glimpses into her vulnerability touching; this was not the usual story of a knight in shining armour come to rescue the poor helpless modern woman, but a self-sufficient woman who would be an equal partner for Alex in any century. I did feel a bit left out, not having read the Jamie/Elizabeth story first; the science/magic of time travel was not sufficiently explained for my taste and sense of logic. But overall I really found it a great read - I'll never think of Godiva chocolate in the same way!"
4,"Excellent selection of works, excellent reproductions",I purchased the earlier book by John Walker very inexpensively (used) and was disappointed to recieve it musty and in bad condition. Nevertheless I found the book enjoyable enough to throw that one away and try again with this edition at a much greater price. It was worth every penny spent on both. The selection of works displayed and the quality of the illustrations are both excellent. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that many of the illustrations are half page in size even though the entire page is devoted to them - to waste so much space instead of making the illustrations larger is sinful.
2,doesn't work for me,"if you've ever been tortured sleepless by RLS, you'd probably try anything. I've tried everything. This seemed like a long shot and it was. Made the urge to move slightly less intense but was not sufficient to get a good night's sleep."
2,Would not recommend,Good illustrations but there was no need for some of the references used for Native American and African American. It reminds of the past.
1,An awful reminder and quite offensive,"My five year old brought this book home and I was enraged that it was still on the shelves. ""They were strong and good"" and helped build this country. YEAH RIGHT! The book portrays Indians as savages and African Americans were slaves. The book left out the part where the country was built on the backs of those slaves and the land stolen from the Indians. While we can't ignore the sad and tragic truth of the American History, we should not continue to celebrate it. Liking this book definitely is definitely based on the lenses in which you look through... I agree this book turns my stomach,"
4,A piece of Americana,"People have to remember the book was published in 1940. The language and ideas are typical of that era. To say it is racist, or to say that it shouldn't be republished is to deny the nations history. I feel the book is a powerful teaching tool for young people to illustrate how America has changed and how far we have come. People who do not appreciate the book have their eyes shut to history."
5,A good first look at family history for kids,"I know from the other reviews that there are a lot of objections to this book but I'm with those that say you take it for what it is. It is family history told to the writer through the eyes of older generations. They didn't have today's sensibilities and they told it to him as it happened to them. Being a genealogy buff, you find that a lot as you delve into your family's past. If you want to understand the older generations in your family, you have to understand where they are coming from.I love Robert Lawson's illustrations and I don't think this book promotes anything negative, just an interest in finding out how the previous generations in your family lived their lives and thought and acted. I think this story can easily spark an interest in history in general and family history in particular. I read it to my kids and I'll be reading it to my grandkids. It will spur some discussions and that's a good thing!"
2,Didn't work very well,"The bubble bear didn't work very well and I recently threw it out. You squeeze it to push the wand up, but usually the wand would come up with no bubble fluid on it. We would shake it, but it still would come up with nothing on it. I got it to entertain my baby, and he loves bubbles, so time after time without working was frustrating. It worked maybe one out of five times. We got a bubble solution with a wand that you dip, and it's a little messier, but it always works. I would not recommend this product."
3,Not Awful but Also Not Perfect,"I saw my son's teacher using one of these at his school and I was attracted to this product's mess-less design. It is truly mess-less, but the wand only goes down so far (about an inch) and you have to have extra soap at the ready fairly soon after you start using it. Otherwise, it works as it should and I would probably buy it again."
3,bubble bwar,"The liquid makes a lot of bubbles. Unless the child is over 4, they don't seem to have the agility to press the bear's belly and blow the bubbles."
2,not great for toddlers,"This bubble toy needs close supervision for toddlers. It is for good babies who are happy to watch an adult blow bubbles, or for an older child (6 or 7+) who can understand that the bear needs to be squeezed just enough to bring the bubble liquid up but if they keep squeezing then the liquid overflows. My kids (ages 2 and 4) make a big mess with the bubble bears and end up frustrated. Younger children also will try to pull out the wand."
3,Just Ok,"This is a cute idea. The bubble solution is fantastic. The bear, is ok. I bought this because it was supposed to not spill, etc... My hands were soaked with the solution when I used it."
3,Expensive,I bought this because I could not find the nos pill anywhere else and my grandson loves bubbles. Then after I bought it and it leaked some I found one exactly the same that did not leak for five dollars less.
4,"Decent taste, easy mixing",I only buy supplements from familiar brands. I've been purchasing EAS products for several years now.This whey protein powder offers a good chocolate flavor but can wear on you quickly (like other protein powders) if you don't mix up your blending recipes often.
4,near perfect,"I love EAS, and this doesn't disappoint. I work out on a regular basis, and use this for post-work out, and for breakfast sometimes. But a helpful suggestion: water won't cut it, unless you're going for the runny, loose, and kind of bleh. For thicker consistency, use milk, soy milk, or (what i use) Silk. It mixes well in a Blender Bottle too. Also, buying from Amazon vs. GNC is a huge difference. GNC may be good for a lot of things, but they're also insanely overpriced. You can also find this in your local grocery store."
2,Beware of Arsenic and other impurities,"I've been on this protein powder for a couple months and I have to admit that I have gained strength and muscle mass when compared to not using it. Taste is good and it dissolves fairly quickly with milk. The problem I'm worried about is I recently saw something on consumer reports with respect to the level of impurities of a particular EAS chocolate shake. Not sure about the accuracy of the report, whether it is this product, or even if the numbers really make a difference (maybe that much arsenic has no real impact). Anyways, just thought I'd share.[...]"
2,Not what I ordered.,"I am a fan of EAS chocolate 100% whey protein and so decided to order in bulk. I was sent some sort of generic whey powder with similar looking packaging - but it wasn't EAS. Returned, and was not offered a replacement with the actual item I tried to purchase."
2,Tastes like regurgitated chocolate,Definitely one of the worst tasting chocolate whey proteins out there. Keeps triggering my gag reflex by the time I'm done chugging the dosage. Think I'll be going back to ON or Dymatize despite them being a bit more expensive.
3,Too much cholesterol and only 76 servings!!!!,"I received my bag today, it has great taste, better than most but, if you compare the amount of servings youll be disappointed only 76 vs 149 from Gold-Optimum,5 pounds both, and it is about the same price, so if your looking for exellent taste and high cholesterol and low amount of servings , get this, but if you want good taste, low cholesterol, and bang for your buck , get something else."
5,Great taste and mix,"I've been using the EAS brand of 100% whey protein (chocolate flavor) from 5lb bags for several months now, and I just love the taste. I triedOptimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Wheyand although it is more popular here on amazon, unfortunately it tastes like a cheap hot chocolate mix while this EAS brand tastes like a chocolate milk shake! The EAS brand mixes well with water or milk. Bring aShaker Bottleand a few scoops of EAS protein powder to the gym in small containers 'like' theseTupperware Midgetsto have before and after your workout! It's great also in smoothies, milk shakes and mixed with milk in cereal!"
5,Great Product,"I have been using this product for years and love it. It taste great and unlike other whey powders this one does ""not"" upset my stomach. I mix it in a blender with half lactose free skim milk and half water. I also add one packet of Stevia in the raw (to make it a little sweater) and also add half a banana with ice. I blend it all up and its awesome!! It tastes like a milk shake, gets nice and thick and is very filling. EAS makes fabulous products and this is the best value out there."
4,Decent,"This is a good vanilla whey protein with few carbs. It is however, quite sweet, which I guess can be good. I like it as much as any other vanilla protein but this companies chocolate is the the best chocolate I have ever had with few carbs as well. So if you were choosing between vanilla and chocolate with these two... go with chocolate."
4,"works fine, but they switched containers on me...","instead of the hard cylindrical container shown, i got a metallic bag with a ziplock... its messier because when you close it up the powder can go airborne a bit. other than that, works the same. really good way to avoid muscle soreness after workouts. definitely helps with muscle recovery. good for runners too, if your calves cramp up at night."
1,worst taste,"yeah..it was inexpensive..but the strawberry flavor tastes like cherry cough syrup! ugh! There's other flavors that are so much better likeWhey gold chocomint(blackcontainer)and spirulina and iron tek cake batter at iherb, and designer whey is good too."
1,Not what I ordered,"I've ordered this in the past with no problem. I went back on Amazon's previous orders page and ordered ""this"" again. Only it wasn't the same as the previous order. Same brand, flavor, size etc. but the new tub contained many more carbs than the previous..If you look closely at the picture it states three nets carbs. If you are watching carbs, be careful that may not be what they send. I contacted the seller, but nothing happened!!"
5,Best I've tried so far,"I have to make sure I get 60 grams of protein a day, and I've tried a lot of protein supplements. This is by far the best tasting, most cost effective, and most easily mixed with other foods, e.g. yogurt, milk . There is no unpleasant aftertaste that I've found in other protein supplements; in fact, it tastes great just mixed in milk The five pound alternative is a great way to get this product at a signifcant savings if you use it regularly."
1,Dont like it,I dont like that many people sells this item as original and say it is like the original when it is not.They will say the scoop is smaller but had the same serving but to forget to tell you if you do the math you get twice the amount of sodium for the same 50 grams of protein...
3,"inconsistent, but would probably purchase again","I would probably give this 3 1/2 stars if I could because I've had different experiences with the product. Unfortunately I don't have much experience with protein supplements.The first time I ordered EAS vanilla, it could not be better. It mixed well and was very drinkable, even with water when I used a martini shaker. For whatever reason, the second batch I ordered does not mix well at all, especially with milk (I had not done anything different in mixing it). It just clumps up and I need to use a fork to break it up for about five minutes. Adding milk is a disaster and with water it tastes horrible unless I get the clumps to dissolve. I'm debating whether to order this again or try something else. None of these reviews mention this problem, so it was probably a fluke - I'm curious if others have had this problem."
3,Not what I expected,"EAS has apparently switched all it's protein to the Abbott. The Abbott brand requires two scoops to make one serving(26g), which is absurd! I miss the old EAS brand that just required one scoop to make a serving of 23 grams of protein. I think I'm gonna switch to another brand because two scoops each serving makes it run out faster; I think it's a way of making the buyer run out of protein faster and have to by more. The protein is okay, but two scoops to make a serving of the old EAS brand is what kills it."
5,"""One of the Best Protein Powders""","I've used a few whey protein powders, EAS was a huge boost in performance. After taking the first serving with Creatine I was able to do 30% more reps - yes, I have positive workouts using EAS over other brands. Plus I was also able to run up seven flights of stairs several times and not get burned out as before. The quality is superior and taste is good. Bought this EAS Whey Protein from ""All Star Health"" their shipping was fast."
4,"good game, but not great","I bought it for my kids (7&6), who love soccer and Mario, so they like it a lot. Graphics are good, Peach looks kinda sexy, hours of fun. Not on my greatest games list, but pretty good for a Nintendo game."
3,Great,"Excelent. I bught this item in ""Like New"" condition and its actually new. WORD WORD WORD WOR WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD WORD"
4,I can't compete,My record online is 3-56. I can't beat anyone..and the one or 2 times i actually am winning..they shut off the game on me. It's only fun playing against friends.
3,Fun and Well Done But...,"This game is very well done with excellent graphics and very creative gameplay. The characters are well done and look great on the Wii. The various abilities each characters have is very interesting to watch and visually pleasing. The biggest issue with this game is that it is very hard. There will many times during the game that you will be extremely frustrated and want to throw the disc against a wall. If you like a challenge then this game is for you. Probably the hardest mario themed sports game I've ever played. However there is still plenty of fun to be had here and if you like fun, but difficult games then give it a try."
3,not bad,"I liked this game at first, and it is fun. However, after a while the game becomes repetitive and a little boring. The animations start to become a little stale after you've seen them a few times. The online play is a little complicated to set up. You have to trade codes to actually play against anyone; there's no just jumping online to play.Overall, I would say this game is a rent not a buy."
2,They almost got it right...,"I won't go into detail about what I like, that is covered in detail in other reviews.I'll focus on the one thing that RUINED the game for us: the MegaStrike. You're playing along and really getting into the flow of the game when someone uses Megastrike. The action stops. The game goes through the same animation cutscene and obnoxious heavy metal riff before getting to the lousy ""minigame"" of being a goalie and trying to stop 4 to 6 soccer shots. And it takes so looooong to get past this. Every...single...time. And you can't shut off the feature so you have to be careful not to hit the button combo that causes a Megastrike. Very hard to do. In the end everyone would just groan when it came up and we finally just put it in its box and never played again.We love Maria Golf and Mario Kart and the other wonderful titles but they really blew it on Strikers with the MegaStrike. We sold our Strikers on Amazon for half what we paid for it and were glad to do it."
1,Disappointment,The game never worked. I guess it is asking too much to confirm the game works before it is shipped by the seller. On a positive note the return process was hassle free and customer service is fantastic.
4,Fun game,"I never played the Gamecube version but the Wii version is definitely fun. As others have mentioned, the single player portion is kind of wacky but that's now why you buy this game anyway. Multiplayer is great, whether you play with friends or online.In response to the comment about the server crashing all the time. This isn't quite true. Most of the time, when this happens, its because of a sore loser that pulls the power cord on their wii so it counts as a disconnect. If they would just give the person that disconnects a loss it would stop this problem immediately."
4,Do you like Smash Bros?,"This is the perfect game for me because i love Smash Bros, my only problem there was i'd always fall of the edge. This game reminds me of it in a way because you still get to throw shells, bombs and such. Much like in Mario Kart and Smash Bros to help you advance, only in this case to score a goal.I like playing this game single player, but also double. I have yet to play with another person in my living room, but online play is definetly fun. There are those people who like to ""cheat"" and aren't in it for the fun but ""points points points"" you want to try and avoid those people, unless you are one of them. Then you were made for each other.Over all i think it's a great game, very entertaining. Now...when is DDR comming out?"
3,"Fine game, but kids just don't like it as much","My kids - boys ages 7 and 9 - like soccer but for some reason neither they nor the neighbor kids have gotten into this game. It seems to have all the bells and whistles and noises and spectacle, but they just haven't enjoyed it as much as some other games. Not sure why exactly - but sometimes some games have a little extra magic to them and others don't."
4,"Incredibly fun, but borders on repetitive","Ever since Nintendo starting making Mario sports games, I've been a fan. The problem is the studio that makes the games doesn't really believe in replay value. The game is fun, funny, and challenging. The problem is that once you beat the game, you are probably not going to pick it up and play it again unless you play with friends.This version of Mario Strikers suffers from that. I blazed through the trophy/cup part of the game and now I'm struggling to still be entertained. I mean, I can continue to unlock some of the characters and secrets, but there's not much else left to do. This is definitely a game that you shouldn't spend a lot of money on. It is a good one to have and play with friends though."
4,Dark lines?,I saw on the Mayo clinic web site that this is recommended for dark circles and other things. It seems to help mine.
1,Came to me USED,"It would have been fine if it was not a return. After noticing small nicks and scratches I found a ""Mystic Mints"" candy wrapper used as a bookmark in the manual. Other than that I'm sure it would've been a fine watch but I immediately sent it back and called customer service and received a full credit. Shame on amazon for not inspecting it more carefully. Their customer service was however quick and painless. I own two other Wavecepter watches and would have given this one five stars..."
1,A Collectors Must Have,"Several years ago I had this album but somewhere over time it became misplaced. In the back of my mind I always new that I must replace it. Every song is a number 1 ""A"" plus sing and praise along. You can be sure I won't lose this album again. Please distribute it in CD format."
4,Excellent read on the era of the Empire and Aurelian!,"This is an excellent book! I was recently in London and discovered this book in a Picadilly area bookstore. I read it when I could, finally finishing it on my flight home. The author dives into the time period and does an excellent breaking down and putting events back into order, backing everything with evidence. Aurelian the Emperor has always been a fascination of mine since childhood (along with Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Julian the Apostate, even Valentinian III; along with every detail of the Roman Empire!), and I am now 48. And to-date this is the best book of literature/ biography of what is known about that fascinating emperor, Aurelian. And one of the best about explaining the backdrop of ""Political"" Roma during the mid -3rd century. A must read!"
2,Bad Packing,"The unit I got was packaged very poorly and was damaged in shipment. After taking it apart and repairing it, I got it to play and eject the disks correctly."
2,Cheap for a reason....,Bought this knowing it was cheap and realizing the quality would be questionable. Was able to get it to fly by having one person to run to launch. That lasted 5 secs before it crashed and the wing broke. Can't find replacement wings online yet...Good luck:).
2,Really BAD!!,I have been flying rc planes my whole life and I was looking for a good deal and a good plane.I did alot of research and I eventually decided to get this plane.I was very excited when i opened the pack but when I built it and tried to fly it one engine wasn't working correctly it will just not fly!I have been trying to fix it but it just isn't working.I'm thinking about taking it apart and using the technology for a home project.Bottom lineDON'T BUY IT!!!
4,Oriole rc airplane,"This is the first rc plane I have ever flown & I must say it is perfect for beginners. I was able to fly it for 4-5 minutes before trying to get fancy and crashing nose first. There was no real damage, just lost a wheel, no big deal. I launched it again and flew until the battery started getting low & was able to land it right next to where I was standing. After a quick battery change (I ordered a spare) I was airborn again, this time no crash. I was able to fly until the battery was getting weak and again no problem landing right next to me. This is a great rc plane to get started on, I was having fun right from the start. Do a little internet research for a good deal, I found mine for $34.95."
2,not useful for training,a bunch of pictures is about all you get out of this or some history on judo. If your looking for training tips and drills then skip this
3,Tough reading to glean a few gems.,"This book is a posthumous collection of Hodgson's essays on world history, Islamic history in particular. Much of the book was unpublished at the time of Hodgson's sudden death. Consequently, the book reads as if Hodgson was thinking out loud. The prose is very dense and he often pounds home points over several pages that could have been made in a paragraph or two. Nonetheless, many of the ideas presented by Hodgson were advanced for the time, and a necessary correction to William McNeill, his fellow University of Chicago prof. Hodgson's main thrust is to set right the place of Islam--or what he calls the ""Islamicate""--in world history. This argument should be well-heeded in view of the overly Eurocentric tone that much work on world history has taken. Specialists on Islam will appreciate the book the most, and anyone interested in world history can benefit from it--but it is a very tough read that could easily be pared down to a precis."
3,Ultimate Paintball Field Guide (for newbies),"Dont get me wrong, this isnt a bad guide to paintball. It covers all the basics very well and has specific sections for both recball and tourney players. However if you have a few years worth of experiance under your belt chances are you already know everything that this book has to offer.For Newbies- 5 starsFor seasoned ballers- 3 stars"
3,Begginer Helper,"This is a realy good guide if you are just starting or if you haven't started yet. It was not a help to me at all to me because i am a pretty expirianced player. The articles are written by expirianced players, but the book makes it seem like they are writing to begginers. I would not spend money on this if you are already got a grip on paintball, but it will help nonexpirianced players get a good idea, and if not, they could change the plan and have a complex stratigy! There were a whole lot of articles that got off the subject as well. The maker needs to make another book for more expirianced players to read and still get help or better ideas."
2,The Jordans in Virginia,This is only the listing of the immediate family. It does not give any history of the name in Virginia history. I was trying for track a family name and was not helped by the book.
1,Get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for with this one... upon receiving the book I found the book is in new condition but once I opened the front cover the bindings were slashed and now my book is falling apart. Also, Amazon has done nothing to help me and now I have a completely value-less 150 dollar book that I won't be able to trade in at the end of the semester... My recommendation is just get your books from the book store."
2,Disappointed,"While the theory is somehow digestible, the problems are way too difficult and out of the real world. TO THE AUTHORS: When you imagine a mechanical system to be analyzed, try to make it real, not weird. Set as unknown the parameters that cannot be measured not those that can. Please, don't distort the engineering thinking of our students. (By the way: Fig. B.1 on page 1297 shows a crankshaft not a camshaft! Your solutions to problems 16.107 and 16.108 in the Instructor's Manual do not include the normal acceleration of the clamp. Energy Conservation when applied to Prob. 16.108 gives a term in omega^2)."
1,Why is this book still in print?,"I don't believe I've ever read a more illogical, poorly organized, overly difficult piece of trash in my life. I'm guessing the only reason my professor used this book is because some of the people in the acknowledgments are affiliated with Penn State. That's probably the only reason anybody uses this book. To anybody who will be required to waste their money on this book, don't even bother reading the sections because they make absolutely no sense and are completely unrelated to the example problems. There is no reason, in my opinion, why a student shouldn't be able to learn and completely understand the material covered in a course soley from reading the textbook. That is clearly not the case with this book, though."
3,Well...,"I found it easier to understand the concepts out of Meriam's book. I'm sure this is an important and useful text, but wow is it dense.One tip: beg, borrow, or steal the solution manual for this text... the problems are absolutely, without question, infeasible without it. Others have said it: they're just too hard. I don't understand what he was thinking writing impossible problems. My 190 year old professor couldn't even solve many of them."
1,Muy aburrido,"Creo que el autor debería empezar por reconocer que es muy pero muy imperfecto. No me gusto nada, pero bueno, para todo hay gustos no?"
1,Un terrible ensayo sobre la mediocridad humana,"Es extraño ver tan buenas críticas a un libro carente de sentido, es de pensarse entonces que los únicos que lo compraron y se atrevieron a decir tales sarandajas sean sus hijos, nietos, empleados y socios.Es uno de los pocos libros que no recomendaría a nadie; es plano y con ideas inconclusas, sin fundamento o con malinterpretaciones de ideas universales; incluso gracias a tal vacío intelectual que presenta debería de permitirse su quema pública, así al menos el librillo se vendería y sería útil para algo.Asombra la mediocridad del escritor para alcanzar la ""perfección"" y la carencia de ideas originales en su manera de escribir."
5,Lots of fun!,"Finally...something productive for the kids to do! My four year old loves doing the ""work-outs"" (although she doesn't know she's actually working out). My twelve year old even does it with her for fun! It's nice for them to be able to do something active indoors with our unbearably hot weather. I am also an Elementary School teacher and plan to take it to school for rainy days or when my students need a little movement. I'm anticipating it being very useful to keep students with ADHD focused and on task."
5,Fun stuff for your kids...,"I have three kids (14yrs, 12yr, 11yrs) and they all love the video workout. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has kids or has family members with kids. I will buy a few as stocking stuffers for Christmas."
2,Wont work if you're bored,"I want to love this DVD, I don't have a problem with it but as it was purchased for my 4yrs old niece & she's bored after watching it a few (very few) times....maybe it's just not for her, she loves to dance & she loves music but it doesn't keep her entertained. If it were returnable I'd say try it and see if your little one(s) like it but for the price..."
2,Completely un-original,"Strange how a musician can decide ""hey that's a great sound, I'll copy it and make a mint"". Someone compared Paul Brown to Norman Brown - there's no comparison there, Norman is a much better musician and sings in key too. The songwriting is nothing to write home about and that electronic voice effect on Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight should feel like pins and needles to James Taylor, who crooned it so softly. Save that stuff for Cher, ok? There's no real swing or groove here, that would require a real drummer (heaven forbid!) I'd rather the guy play solo than use cheap backup like that. Go get some Wes Montgomery, George Benson, Ronny Jordan, or especially Zachary Breaux instead."
1,BORING,"This is the kind of record that has taken Smooth Jazz from a vibrant, innovative format to the proverbial ""elevator music"" sound!"
3,Don't play this CD after lunch hour...,"...or you'll falling sleep.Most complaint people made here about the album is true!!! I didn't believe it but now after spending $8, I agree with most of them. I put the CD in while eating my lunch at the office with my headphone on, half way to the middle of the CD I just got so tired, I could barely keep my eyes open. I thought it was the food coma but came to realize it was the music. If it was not 24/7, I might get caught by the boss for napping on the job. Ok, the above is more of a joke than real, although that is how I realy feel about this album."
2,Disappointing,What a disppointment? I did not expect this CD to be such a flop since I respect Paul Brown as good producer especially where he worked with Bob James
2,Brown can probably expect a lawsuit from the RIAA...,"Because he downloaded too many other artists songs to make his first CD. Generally, producers do a poor job of producing their own projects. Over half of the tracks on Up Front are either remakes or samples from other artists. The first three tracks start off promising as Brown does his best Wes Montgomery/ George Benson impression. Everything is going well then for some reason he tries to sing which sounds like a bad rendition of Boz Scaggs. On Phat City, Boney James slips through the backdoor and you realize why Boney is producing himself on his next project. From track 8 Brown obviously runs out of material as he covers Bill Withers to Fat Larry's Band? to DJ Cam/Herbie Hancock to Ndugu Chancellor to Van Morrison. On Up Front, Paul Brown ends up sounding like all the artists he produces and as a result his own originality suffers."
3,"Underwhelming, Mr. Brown","When you listen to recent Boney James, Kirk Whalum, Larry Carlton, Jonathan Butler, and Peter White, songs, and feel the funk, it's usually because Paul Brown had something to do with it. Well, on his first solo CD, something is missing. Has Paul's funky friends turned their backs on him? No, his friends are there, but at diluted strength. Paul steps out front playing guitar (think basic George Benson licks) over, at times funky beats. He even takes a stab at vocals. Perhaps the worst thing about the CD is the song selection. As stated by another reviewer, there are too many songs that are too familiar. Ain't No Sunshine (I think Boney did this one on his Seduction CD, I think Paul Brown even had some involvement in the track).My Funny Valentine (Why?), Moondance (Van Morrison) again, (Why?) Overall the CD is underwhelming, especially to fans of his past productions, and colaborations."
3,"keep on playin', lose the singin'!!","I was attracted to Paul Brown's music through hearing an instrumental on the radio. After I bought and received the album, I put it on with great anticipation, only to be disappointed. Not by Paul's musicianship and instrumental abilities, but by his singing! He has a ho-hum kind of voice, which does not enhance the songs on which he puts it to use. If you read this, Paul, I'm sorry, but that's my opinion (and I'm a musician myself). The instrumental cuts on this album are just fine, but I won't buy any others if I know that there is his singing on it. It is not that he's out of tune, or unrhythmical, it's just not an interesting voice."
4,""" A fine player""","I hadn't heard of Paul Brown until I heard 24/7 on smoothjazz radio. What a terrific guitarist. Really skilled; ""silkysmooth"" and he obviously has vast talent in many contexts. I sub-sequently found out that Paul Brown has produced so many great artists.Up front is a really nice CD. I'm not thrilled with Paul's vocals, but his guitar work is so good, I'll get past hissinging. I look forward to future projects."
4,Engaging....,"This is the story of Faith Smith, a British weather broadcaster on a UK morning show.After celebrating her 15th anniversary, she starts suspecting her husband of infidelity & it consumes her every waking moment, until her husband confesses to having an affair. After that shocking revelation their lives turn upside down, with new lovers & future plans. Finding herself on unfamiliar grounds she agonises over her husband betryal & how on earth is she going to forgive him. Or will she?The characters are well developed & the story is well written to the point where I got a little depressed & wanted to scream at her husband for what he put her through!Good read."
3,Not as good as her other work,"I've loved Wolff's other books, her characters are fun, funny, the stories move fast and the characters are endearing. But this one could have been written by another author, for all it resembled her other works. Maybe I couldn't get into the older character, but I actually stopped reading about 1/4 of the way through. I would definately try another Wolff book, because I think she's a fabulous writer, it's just that this story did nothing for me. Neither the plot nor the character grabbed me. I'll have to try again next time."
3,Long Live The Queen review,I was a little disappointed in Lisa Lampannelli this time. She doesn't use a lot of new material and the stuff that is new isn't all that funny. It really wasn't worth what I paid for the DVD. I've laughed out loud more watching her on youtube than I have watching this DVD.
5,Long Live the Queen,This skit is great - less offensive than some of her other stuff and hysterical! The worst jokes were put as extra scenes :)
3,Not Her Best,"I really enjoyed her Lonesome Lawman series. I especially enjoyed the humor which is totally missing in this book.I bought this book in the e-book format from E-Reader. Not only is the humor missing, but where was the editor? The version I read was full of gramatical errors, missing or misplaced words, etc. I like this author and hope the print version has avoided some of the (many, many) mistakes I encountered in the electronic version, but I hope she returns to the light hearted writing she does best."
3,cuckold,"<html>I personally loved this book, i thought it was very entertaining, i just couldnt put it down, it's a really good story and i reccomend it for anybody, it was filled with good <A HREF=""http://www.cuckold-authority.thumblogger.com"">cuckold</a> stories..</html>"
4,KUDOS TO KIRAN NAGARKAR,"kiran nagarkar is far ahead of all Indian writers. cuckold has no flab inspite of its length. the novel transports you to a bygone era and keeps you there. language, plot, technique - cuckold has it all and how. the character of kausalya stays fresh in the mind.the sahitya academy award in India is only the beginning, it deserves greater accolades.my greatest take is the character of the protagonist... we are able to relate to the prince because he comes across as someone we want to be.chandra mouliwww.storiesfromindia.com"
5,I am so glad I have found this book again!!!,"I am so excited to have found this book! I am not the type of person to read a whole book. I start reading it then put it down and never pick it up again. This is the first book that I could not get enough of. I got it as a present years ago and lost it when I moved. I learned so much on how to be a Godly woman and a great wife to my husband. This book teaches how to look Godly and be more mature and organized so that God can use you as effectively as possible. You will not regret getting this book. It is so down to earth and practical, yet teaches Godly principles. Thank you Anne for writing such a wonderful book!Lea"
1,The only Christian book I've ever thrown in the trash.,"I read this book years ago, as a young, single mother trying to raise a son alone. I wanted so much to be a disciplined, beautiful woman, but I couldn't relate to a single thing this woman talked about. Going to Hawaii to rest up after surgery? I could barely afford to go across town for groceries. A maid? Forget about it. I put the book aside and picked it up many years later and still couldn't relate to it. This book was mostly a ""live the way I live or you aren't Christian enough!"" book. No thanks. There are many many other books on the market that address heart issues and true spiritual beauty and not one of them mentions luxurious vacations or how many outfits you're supposed to have in your closet. If you want a real book about true spiritual beauty and discipline, find books by Martha Peace or Elizabeth George."
1,Hate to give a bad review but this book really earned it!!,Anne Ortlund seems like a wonderful Godly woman but a lot of the focus of this book is about getting the outside looking beautiful. I was looking for tips on how to be beautiful on the inside and she is telling me to cream my body each night so it's soft for my husband's touch. A lot of focus on being organized and keeping a clean house but not much on becoming beautiful inside.
1,Long & Winded Road,"I have enjoyed Larry and Peter live, and thought this CD mightalso be good, but it just doesn't translate. Its obviously a ride they are enjoying,but ethereal it is not. Unfortunately, boring is the word of the day.And if one more group does homage to Burt Bacharach, I may becomeill. All together, this CD is a disappointment.Sue Durbani, New York, NY"
4,TKD Uniform for Kids,Price and quality balance. I bought one for my 6 years old and I will buy the next size when my kid needs it
5,Great quality uniform,"My daughter uses this for her MA class and there are no complains from her or me. We are very happy with this purchase and when she grows out of it, we will buy her a larger size."
4,Bongos a go go,"This album is great stuff. Much of the material on the album was written for a film called The Creature With Two Heads. While the film itself was no great success, its music certainly is. You should give it a listen. Bongos have never sounded better. Buy it."
3,does what it says!,"Good product, but expect them to be one use only, once they are in the bottle it takes the strength of lou ferrigno to get these things back out."
1,If you like newsprint pages you'll love this edition.,"My Bantam English Italian Dictionary is several years old now, and the perfect binding is beginning to fail. I ordered this book, also by Robert Melzi, in the expectation I would get better quality by paying about five times the price. Wrong. Typograpy is poor and the paper is awful. Avoid it."
3,Good for Upscale Restaurants,"While I liked the book and agree with the other reviews, this book is limited in scope - the autors did an execllent in the places they did review. If you are looking for a complete listing of places, this is not the book for you."
3,so far so good,"it is my third racquet in two years, i just bought it and so far seems it is ok, except for the little bit loose string."
3,Middle of the road...,"I didn't find any new, earth-shattering insights into the resume process, but it did layout the fundamentals nicely. I learned a few new things, and it gave me a good outline to put together a resume.The section that describes how to pull the resume information together, would have been presented better had it been in some sort of a chart or list format. The way it is set up - it is wrtten in long sentences that stretch over a couple pages. I had to keep flipping back and forth to remember what step to do next.There was a lot of redundant information, and I thought the examples didn't help me much.But in the end, it did prompt me to put together a new, more concise, and tailored resume. Although the description of how to edit the final resume was a bit broad."
2,"Samples are too simplistic, general, and all look the same","I don't see much that would distinguish the sample resumes in this book from all the rest. I have a number of resume books from 20 years ago and the formats and text looks the same today in this book as 20 years ago. Hasn't anything changed? Other books that are written by ""certified"" resume professionals on the market today seem to be more ""marketing"" orineted in that the resumes seem to communicate ones's market value rather than to just showcase one's work history."
2,Unoriginal and uninsightful,This book offers no new insight in how to write an effective resume. The advice given can easily be found on the internet or a book from the local library. Most of the sample resumes just list duties and education and does not help the reader in communicating how their skills can be beneficial to the employer.
2,"so-so guide,nothing new and especially weak on e-resumes",Rehash of standard resume guides. Offers no particularly insightful comments or unique advice. Includes typically bland resume examples and certainly doesn't live up to its title. Much better guides elsewhere
1,Book doesn't give good sampling of resumes for professionals,"This book has too many resumes that focus on having a ""career objective"", a very much outdated approach, rather than strategically highlighting the candidate's skills positioned to meet the needs of the employer. It doesn't sample resumes that focus on drawing out the candidates skills and laying them out in a creative way. The resumes all look the same and are written more for admin assistants than real professionals."
2,Too General and Elementary,"Book offers too simplistic and barely entry-level formatting and ideas. The styles were all basic and not varied enough, and the jobs were all low level. I am a marketing director and the upper level resumes they had were still so basic they were not useful as examples. Might be good for high school students, though."
1,Books shows amateurish resumes,This book shows a bunch of resumes that would barely be good enough for an entry level or secretary to use. They are not value-added and have no focus on tying business needs of the employer to those skills articulated on the resume. The Knock Em Dead Cover Letter book is equally as shallow. The author should have better material given the string of books published.
2,its not working properly. missing a washer,"Help Received the pump , opened , and put together . Notice it was missing a Washer? Put the pump in the water it doesnt seem to be working properly. Is it because of the washer? or is it just a low volume pump?"
1,Infertility is not a death sentence!,"Having had 4 miscarriages, and knowing the pain of infertility quite intimately myself, I take offense to the author's description of infertility as a horrific, lifelong, emotional death sentence. Even though I know that my experience with infertility has changed me and will forever be a part of my emotional wallpaper; I fully intend that I will resolve my infertility and that the feelings associated with it will be less in the forefront of my daily life.The book is poorly written with grammatical and editing errors throughout.I have acquired quite a number of books on infertility in the 5 years that my husband and I have been trying to have a baby; this book will not be one that I will share with others."
2,Not what I expected,"While the author has been to hell and back, I was expecting to read more of the authors life and tribulations and successions. There was only about 26 pages of her story, then I was welcomed to about 150 pages of medical jargen and discriptions of medical proceedures and statistics, which as a patient of infertility I know the meanings of what IUI, IVF, Laps already. I had hoped she would of written about her decision to adopt and talked about her life more."
4,Very well done...,Beautifully explained and portrayal of one of the world's finest city.I really enjoyed learning more about places I had visited while in Paris.
5,"If you love Paris, you'll love this book ... just like the one on London","As I said in my review of ""London Then and Now"", this series is wonderful for both the history buff and the traveler. Great then and now photos. This is a rare series and hard to find, at least in my experience. But Amazon had both the London and Paris editions. I found Rome and Barcelona locally. The prices on these volumes are so reasonable that one can afford all of them."
5,Witty and clever,"This book was made into a TV movie starring Julia Duffy and Cindy Williams, and the luscious Ed Marinaro, among others, but trust me--the book was better. The movie moved the family from Connecticut to California, left out the Kathleen character (a big no-no, if you ask me), and turned Susan's husband into a workaholic jerk, making her susceptible to the charms of Brett. The only real similarities between the plots of the book and the movie were that the families were for the most part, wealthy, and someone did get murdered at a PTA luncheon. The book, Wolzien's first in the ""Susan"" series, was more complex and the characters much more believable than the caricatures in the TV movie. In this one, you see more of the contrast between the haves and the have nots. Kathleen's character is the most complex and the most interesting here. It's neat to see what Wolzien does with her in future outings in this series"
4,Introduction to the Susan Henshaw Mystery Series,"Susan Henshaw is just as puzzled as the police are when two of her co-workers on the school PTA are poisoned within a short time. She works with a police investigator who thinks that her powers of observation and deduction will be a help to him. As Susan and the police delve into the lives of the PTA families in their wealthy Connecticut neighborhood, they uncover possibilities of adultery and drug abuse. It isn't until the end that they put together the clues and finally come up with the murderer. The motive is pretty thin, but still this book is a fun read and is the beginning of a long-running series."
1,Stay Away From This Printer!,"I do not know about the later versions of the LJ1200, but I have a 1200, and I 've been sorry that I bought it since the first day I've had it. This printer is complete garbage. It is cheaply made, does not even print straight, and has trouble with anything other than a Windows PC. I have using HP Laserjets since the ""HP LaserJet"" was the current model, and this printer does not have *any* of the qualities that I used to associate with HP laser printers. Maybe this is HP's way of punishing us for not buying inkjets, I don't know. But you should certainly avoid this printer like the plague."
3,Not what I expected,"The service was great from the seller, but the sunglasses don't fit like I expected them to. They look almost identical to my Oakleys in the picture. However, the sunglasses don't wrap like I would expect them to. I guess that is why they don't cost as much as Oakleys."
5,Best Album I've Purchased in Years!,"I picked up this album three weeks ago and haven't stopped playing it. It is extremely uplifting and the lyrics are amazing to listen too. The negative reviews must have to do with the album not being as ""heavy"" as previous work by LIVE. Just because all the songs aren't ""heavy"" doesn't make the songs not good. I can listen all the way through from song 1-12 and enjoy the journey every step of the way. If your a Live fan or if you aren't, this album is definitely worth a purchase!Favorite songs thus far: Mystery, Night of Nights, Sophia, Wings"
3,"Not the best, but pretty good.","On a new record label now, Live returns with a strong CD. Catchy songs, tight playing. But it still doesn't hit me like Mental Jewelry or Throwing Copper."
2,"From the music, lyrics, the inlay, the whole package was weak","After this album had been pushed back for so long, I should have suspected something was not right...don't get me wrong, I love Live and think they are the best live, but this album from the lyrics to the music seem quite forced/safe and put together quickly.... even the CD Liner Notes and Photos were weak. I am not expecting them to create the next contemporary classic, but if this were a sports team, i would light a fire under the players, and get the linemates contributing."
1,The worst album in Live's career,"Plain, simple, easy pop songs. I miss classics such as ""Lakini's Juice"" or ""Freaks"". Not dark anymore. Not catchy melodies. The vocals are weak and lack emotion. You need inspiration boys!!!If you like the old, stronger and darker stuff from LIVE get away from this. If you like easy simple pop songs, get this!"
4,"This is Live ""lite"" but a good album nonetheless","This is the most upbeat Live album to date. You won't hear any of the classic ""grit"" that you've come to know with past Live cds. In other words, you won't hear anything close to a song like ""Waitress"" or ""Lakini's Juice."" This is a very positive sounding album and it has some great tunes on it - namely ""The River,"" ""Wings"" and ""All I Need."" It's better than ""Birds"" I must say and even though some of these songs could be played on lite fm radio, that doesn't take away from the integrity of the album. Hey at least they're giving us something different to listen to. Live hasn't faltered yet. This is a good listen as always."
4,live rules,"I'll have to admit Im very biased because in my eyes live can do no wrong. I am a die hard live fan. This album is propably right where there last album left off. Its not even close to there best. However the albums they made in the early day's are classics. Its hard for bands in there older age to create that same kind of magic. This album has some classic sounding live songs like show, and river bolth solid songs. I wish they would put a couple dark rock songs on there albums still. Ed's gettin soft in his old age, but that's not abad thing."
2,"Like Bon Jovi, a failed attempt to 'grow up'","While the two bands have completely different roots, they've fallen into the same trap. Having great success at writing 'adult' ballads, their default songwriting now *starts* in that mode, forgetting their harder, more emotional rock roots.Doing business that way (business instead of music), a band forgets how to rock. Any attempt to retrace their steps becomes as awkward as Dad ""hanging out"" at a pizza party. Dad brought ""Birds of Pray"" and SFBM to the party. And while Dad might enjoy grooving to this harmless mellow vanilla sound, the young and young at heart just stare uncomfortably, eventually shuffling on to something cooler, better, and real."
1,Songs From The Cack Mountain,"First of all, I had to give this album 1 star because there is no option to give NO STARS!!When i heard this album, it was the final straw for me! I'll never buy another LIVE album again! The songs may as well be written for some 'Boy Band'- It is literally shocking... What happened Guys? I remember tracks such as Freaks, Ghost, T.B.D, Lightning Crashes, White Discussion and 10,000 Years, and although i dont want Live to stay the same and write in style I like,I believe they have had a great idea of 'lets make a lot of money from this while we still can'!?!The music on this album is simplistic, but not in a good way! I think that its 3 bad albums for LIVE now- I'm just gonna presume they died after 'The Distance to Here'- Even 'TDTH' has bad elements within it...Live- YOU GUYS STINK MAN"
5,Brilliant!,"I live in Europe and cannot always keep up with bands that are primarily popular in the United States, but this time I heard ""The River"" on an Internet radio station, loved it, and started to look into the band. ""Live"" is a really sucky name for a group which anyone wants to find on Google, but that's beside the point. The music is phenomenal, and I particularly enjoy the voice of lead singer Ed Kowalczyk. To me he sounds a lot like another one of my all-time favorite singers, the country singer Chris Cagle. The songs on this album are poppish, yes, but they tell stories and are beautifully orchestrated. Love it, love it, loooooooooooove it!"
5,I love this album!,"Songs from Black Mountain is another commendable notch in Live's belt. Being a Live fan since first hearing ""Selling the Drama"" in 1994, after listening to Black Mountain, I knew that the critics would slam it. There is no doubt that it is a pop album, like Birds of Pray, but Black Mountain possesses greater emotion. You can't fault the guys for growing as men and seeing the big picture that we call `life'. ""Wings"" is an incredible song that everyone will love. The notion of Love runs down Black Mountain like a gigantic waterfall. ""Home"" speaks about soldiers in the desert as they long to get home. I would recommend Songs from Black Mountain to anyone. Thank you, Live!"
1,2 or 3 decent songs...,"thr first 2 albuns by live are good, and secret samadhi got good songs...but SONGS FROM BLACK MOUNTAIN must be the worst album by live...besides 2 or 3 decent songs, the rest of the songs are incredibly mellow with uninspired mellow lyrics...TERRIBLE! The worst album by live..."
2,Disapointed,What ever happened to live. They use to rock and now they sing songs about god for eds daughters. Get back to your roots.
1,A complete disappointment,"Let me say first that I've been a huge fan of Live since I first heard ""I Alone"" well over 10 years ago.So what happened? Aside from a track or two, this album is boring, generic pop-rock garbage. In fact, listening to this album, I was embarassed to think that this is the same band that released ""Throwing Copper"" and ""Secret Samadhi"", the former being one of the best rock albums of the 90's and one of my favorite albums of all time.Sorry to say this, but I think I'm done with this band. I forgave them for the abysmal ""V"", but never in a million years did I think they'd manage to put out something even worse."
5,Live Is Back with a new sound,"I have been a fan of Live for a few years now, ever since Throwing Copper was suggested to me by my mom's Fiancee. I have to say this band has matured exceptionally Since Throwing Copper. Birds Of Prey was a HUGE let down, but with Songs From Black Mountain Ed and the boys are back on track. This one is lighter than the old Live, but not everything can be a Throwing Copper People. This album is Right up there with Throwing Copper in my opinion. If you have an open mind or better yet a die hard fan like I am check this one out, you won't regret it."
5,Arsonists - Date of Birth,"I love it. Ok we all miss Freestyle, but he will come with a Solo-album, so we have something to look forward to! And D-stroy of course who allready dropped an EP, and soon maybe an album? : )This Album IS filled with incredibly much energy!The tracks are mad fat, Incredible betas by Q-Unique, and the have a guest-producer: Psycho Les drom Beatnuts, I mean can he make a beat that aint FABOLOUS!!! The Track he produces is ""Self-Righteous Spics (anthem)"" and it's FRESH!!The best beat I heard in a long time is on Language Arts with birds, and pouring water, AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!But its not only the beats, The rhymes (mostly battle ) are smart, and everyone of dem has a Great FLOW, Their style doesn't remind me of any group...hmmm..maybe NON-PHIXION..All I Can say IS BUY IT, NOW!!!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"This cd was a great disapointment to me. I loved ""As the world burns"" and naturally I went out and bought ""Date of birth"". Wasted money I say. The only thing I've heard from any ofthe Arsonists members that's any good since ""As the world burns"" is Freestyle's guest appearance on Looptroops cd ""Modern Day City Symphony"" so I would rather recommend that instead of this cd."
2,MIA CD please,"It came in a very timely manner. However the book came with a CD and if your not sending it, would have been nice to know. Book was more abused than stated as well. Thanks for sending so fast though."
3,OK for new practicioners,"I have been practicing various types of yoga for 12 years. I was hoping for something more in depth, so I was a bit disapointed in this video. I'll keep it around to loan out to friends who ask me about yoga, rather than loaning out my David Swenson Short Forms video I'd been sending out on loan. OK, but not great. Not what I'd hoped for in a video."
5,Excellent Research,"I have read the book several times and was moved by the researched materials the author collected and presented in a logical manner to prove that Taj Mahal was a Hindu palace, taken over by Sahjahan to remould it to what it is now.The materials presented are very authentic, with multiple references to prove the author must have spent several years to collect these.A truely remarkable book, a must read for anyone interested in Indian history."
1,haaa what a Joke !,"This book is not a History book but just an opinion of a racist writer) I think this is the most worst book I have ever read (& probably the only worse book that amazon carries),This book is based on racism against the Muslims (Mughals)...creators of most beautiful architecters in India & Pakistan , thanks God I was familiar with the story of Taj Mahal even before I read this book,this book is simply a piece of crap in my opinion the following books are good,Taj Mahal Lovers' Story by Mantoshe Singh Devji also buyIn the Land of the Taj Mahal by Ed Rothfarb"
1,Baffling the facts is what this book is all about,"Namaste (Indian Hi)I bought this book & it brought nothing to me but shame, although the writer tried his best to prove (with silly & illogical examples) that the Taj Mahal stands on a place where there was a Lord Shivas temple, being a Hindu it should have made me a little bit proud that the Taj Mahal stands on a place where there was a temple, but it DOES NOT, infact after reading this book I feel disgraced & insulted, this book is nothing but just remarks of a racist writer, his language against Mughals (muslim emporers who created Taj Mahal) is very disgraceful & filled with prejudice (you will feel that if you will read the book), but I urge you NOT TO READ THIS BOOK , Amazon has a variety of different books read them, I would recommend the following two books1)Taj Mahal by Jean-Louis Nou2)The Taj Mahal (Great Buildings) by Christine Moorcroft"
5,Excellent Book on Exposing Islam,"ISLAM IS A FAITH OF TERROR! For those trying to be politically correct, you are all fools! The so-called 'Islamic Arch and Dome' are charactoristics of Mauryan Architecture (ce.300BCE-100AD) in Buddhist India long before Islam even arose.Secondly, the Taj, even if not a Hindu Temple, was built by Hindu Hands and according to Hindu Shilpa Shastra, used as early as the Indus-Valley in 4000BCE, the so-called ""Islamic Designs"" are again seen on pre-Mughal Jaina Temples such as Mt. Abu and Buddhist Monuments. This book exposes Islam for what it really is, not the biased view as seen by Western Eyes to promote it out of foolishness."
5,Highly recommendable,"One of the best books I ever read. If you want to to know the truth about Vietnam, this book ist a must. Peter Scholl-Latour was present in Vietnam from the French intervention to the Chinese episode. He writes very cromprehensive and with great knowlegde. Partuculary exciting is that it is a report of his personal experiences, without pretending to be a political or military scientificly valid study. That makes it more accessable to non-political expert readers. Of course, he is a worldwide acknowledged expert.Particulary for american readers, I think this book from a non-american is important to read. Often, the american vision about the Vietnam war is somehow distorted.So it is a very exciting and informative lecture."
2,Won't completely back you up...,"Just as another reviewer warned, the 'outlet' thingy that you plug your usb cable into easily becomes loose and renders the drive useless.And, as another reviewer mentioned, the software is very clunky. Its constantly trying perform different tasks when you're not even using the drive... it has a real presence on your computer when it shouldnt be one of the most active software you have-- it should be there when you need need it, not constantly interfering with your activities and bothering you about back ups you don't need to make.While its a good value for your money, I don't recommend buying this as your failsafe or your safety net. I recommend purchasing this if you want a secondary drive or need one for unimportant documents-- dont use this one as your only backup or your most important documents. If it would be devastating to lose the information you put on this drive, then back it up somewhere more reliable too or don't buy it at all."
1,Failed after 13 months,"Product OK while it worked, but now can not be recognized by any computer (tried it on 3) although it shows in system management. But can not access it can not retrieve data.Recommend avoid Maxtor / Seagate."
2,worked fine until it failed- listen for warning sign,This drive worked fine until it failed on me after about a year - 60gb worth of data out the window. Warning--as soon as you start to hear any metal-scraping-on-metal sounds from it ---bail out immediately and transfer info to another drive. I waited about 2 months until disaster struck.
5,INCREDIBLE BUY!!,"I cannot say enough about this... It arrived in great condition and came with great accessories at a wonderful price. Items bought seperately would have been waaay more expensive! I purchased it as a gift and everyone has raved about it. The book didn't give the best information on how/why to wire the tree and how/why to trim it, so you may be interested in additional reading that you can probably find for free online anyhow -- still a nice, full color book. A++++++++++++"
1,Hate It,I wish whoever shot him had a good aim because he missed everything on 50 but got him in the tooth and that is it. Tell me another thing when has it been cool to not shoot back at you enemies. Oh well maybe another guy with a better aim will have better luck next time. F&%$ whoever thinks this is a dumb review because I am only speaking the truth. GGGGGGG....be quiet with that now it is dumb sounds like you have a speech inpediment B*&^%.
4,Muppet Show Series 8/ Dr. Phil VAn Neuter Action Figure,"Item was as described! Fast shippment! Very satisfied! My son collects Muppet palisades, and this was a great add to his collection!Rhonda Miklosik"
4,She did it again!,"I loved Henke's first book, After Anne, so I waited with anticipation for her next book, Finding Ruth, which wasn't quite as good as Anne (but that would be a hard one to top). So, when the third book, Becoming Oliva, came out, I couldn't wait to read it. I was not disappointed. It is wonderful to have an author who can continue to write a book that makes it so easy to identify with the characters. She makes them so real. I will be eagerly waiting the next book....Always Jan."
4,Fantastic - A Keeper!,"Olivia ""Libby"" Marsden returns in Roxanne Sayler Henke's Coming Home to Brewster series. Libby is at home in the North Dakota town she has inhabited all her married life, but she is no longer at home in her own skin. She's blessed with good kids, a great husband and plenty of money to allow her to stay home and fulfill her dream of writing a novel, and yet, depression clamps its fingers around her soul without warning. As she struggles to make sense of overwhelming despair, her newfound faith in God is her only lifeline. Sensitively told through the author's personal experience, this realistic and skillfully woven novel packs emotional clout. In BECOMING OLIVIA, Henke dispels the myths surrounding a common mental illness that many struggle to overcome.-Romantic Times BOOKclub Magazine (http://www.romantictimes.com/)"
3,A little slow,"I loved After Anne, and could not wait to read this book. I felt this story was slow and had a hard time getting through it. I never felt the kind of pain Libby was going through or the emotional wrath that I should have felt for her depression. The same themes kept coming up over and over. It always seemed she was drinking coffee to get through the day. There was so much more that could have come from this story. I think Roxanne Henke is a great writer this book just did not inspire me."
5,Becoming Olivia,"Becoming Olivia"" is Roxanne Henke's best book yet! Again the character development is outstanding--from Libby and Bob, to Emily and her teenage friends, to Peg and the hospital patients. Each was a real-flesh human being, warts and all. I was caught up in the story immediately and felt a part of it right up to the last page. As an educator, I couldn't help but note the many ""lessons"" it teaches about family relationships, teenage issues, Christian struggles, and of course the many facets of mental illness as it can be experienced, is perceived, and might be treated.Deloris Jensen, Minneapolis, Minnesota"
5,highly recommended!,"I gave this book to my husband for Valentine's Day and he loved it! The quotes are thoughtful, funny, inspiring and diverse. Sometimes the juxtaposition of the quotes themselves is humorous. Many of the quotes ring a note of profound wisdom and I often find myself thinking as I read, ""Yes, how true!"" Of course, the topic is immense and here it's covered from various aspects, A to W, in an organized, easy to use manner. I imagine writing this was a labor of love and probably compiled over years of reading on the topic. Our copy now resides the bathroom and makes for wonderful, quick reading. You can open the book anywhere and find some hearty nugget to laugh at or ponder. A delight to read, it makes a great gift too."
3,Some serious sound issues to deal with...,"I'm not sure what the sound guy was doing during this performance, but he wasn't anywhere near Jamal, all of which makes this album sound like a poorly recorded bootleg rather than an official release. You get a very distinct impression of the drums and the bass, but you continually strain to hear the melody, as if you're behind a column in the back of the club. If you can content yourself with the lousy seating arrangement (and sound) you've been given, you'll have a decent enough time... but don't expect Jamal to drop by your table when it's over."
3,A good chronicle that becomes repetitive,"Michael Malone does a great job chronicling the birth and life of the microprocessor, but some of his material becomes a little repetive. Ultimately, I started to lose interest in the whole story. Although his information is well documented, and he apparently has an excellent grasp of every aspect of the microprocessor industry, he probably could have edited out a good deal of the material. On the positive side, I was elated to see someone finally give proper credit where it was due, especially to Federico Faggin, whose name never appears where it should in the microprocessor history books: right next to Ted Hoff and Stan Mazor."
4,Brilliant but a Bit Overpriced,"It's a bit bigger than I was thinking and looks a lot like a garage door opener. It works great to help me focus on things I'm studying, or things I want to keep to at the forefront of my mind. But it seems like for what it is--basically a timer with special features--it should be a little less expensive.Still, if money is no or little object, I recommend it highly."
4,When you aren't sure what else to try.....,"I work in an elementary school setting with children that have a variety of specialized academic, social and behavioral needs. The MotivAider is so far an effective tool in assisting with toileting reminders for a mainstream student. It is discreet, relatively easy to set and reset and can be utilized for countless reasons."
4,useful,"This is a good product-my son is not ADHD, but he is messy and gets off-task in class pretty easily when bored. This helped keep him on-task in class, especially in the one class in which a teacher was coming down on him. It at least gave her the illusion that something was being done by my son and me...she sure did not have any ideas of her own, except to complain. I started out keeping having him keep a log of on-task behavior at each interval, but faded that pretty quickly. I don't think his behavior really changed that much, but the teacher's perception of it did."
2,Meh,"It's about as useful as an egg timer, but quieter, much more complicated to set up, more cheaply made, and costs way more money."
4,Psychedelia With an International Twist,"WOW!...backwards, spells !WOW...What can I say here about this totally amazing compilation that hasn't already been said?If anything, it is absolute aural proof that the youth culture of the 60's reached very far and wide indeed; well beyond Great Britain and The United States. There are songs in here from groups as far away as Uruguay, New Zealand, Spain, and Japan!The color, excitement, and sheer creativity of the psychedelic era shines through every track.The influence of British groups like The Who, early Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones can be heard on the very first tracks, and it's a safe bet that if you enjoy them, you will enjoy this set."
5,Loads of fun,I can't add more than whats been said other than I just sat thru the four discs in one gulp and thoroughly enjoyed the tuneage however after a while it starts to get redundant. Not that I wouldn't highly recommend this to my friends for it is a excellent collection of tunes and I certainly recognized more than I thought I would. If you love British rock/ psych/ garage rock than buy this with confidence as it will provide hours of fun.
2,It's not rock'n'roll,"I LOVE Nuggets I. The only reason there is a Nuggets II is because the record company is getting greedy. Nuggets I is a compilation of vinyls and has been a classic for a long time... And people love it because the music is so great. Nuggets II is just another way for them to earn another buck. If you are really interested in garage music, forget about Nuggets II - it's all non-american music (and I'm not american either) but they just don't get it."
3,Marketing strategy or unfortunate mistake?,"Rhino is promoting this box set (with their usual disregard for subtlety) by claiming it has ""No Hits"". Huh? I wouldn't call the international Top 10 hit by the Status Quo, ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" exactly a flop. And The Easybeats surely deserve credit for their one worldwide hit, ""Friday on my mind"". There are at least a half dozen other tracks here that were either hits or minor hits in the UK, so to claim there are no hit tracks is, quite simply, bull. AND they have the nerve to call the track ""I Can only give you everything"" a VAN MORRISON track, when, as everybody knows, it is a THEM track (with Van Morrison on vocal). So much for accuracy. Lots of obscurities, granted, but quite a few average, anonymous-sounding things as well."
2,As dull as the original is essential,"The original Nuggets celebrated the democratic spirit of creation and the enotions of lust and anger. This collection dabbles in future stars (of prog, the antithesis of the original's punk) and wifty hobbitry, while never really developing a focus.Sure the Creation and the Easybeats are brilliant, and there are a decent number of fine tracks, but most of this is European b-sides by future ice skating keyboard players. The German stuff isn't even good as a novelty. The one track from Japan shows a route that might have been better explored, ditto one in Portugese (though it doesn't fit even this box's vague direction).Hollywood can produce better and more focussed sequels than this. Shame on Rhino!"
3,"Good idea, so-so execution","This one's taken some hard knocks, which are not entirely undeserved. It's an uneven release.Interesting how Imogen Heap's contribution seems to polarize people. I'll just say that I adore it, and would recommend risking $0.99 on it any day of the week, month, year, or decade. It's just that brilliant."
2,A dreadful mess featuring two gems,"As if the concept of this project weren't strange enough, the bulk of the artists approach their contributions subjects too literally making this a quite painful listening experience. Particularly guilty are the tracks by Klashnekoff, Scott Walker, Stephen Merritt, & Cody ChesnuTT. What makes this CD so frustrating is that it contains two tracks that are brilliant creative gems by Imogen Heap & Rufus Wainwright. These contributions shine as among those artists best works and are the only reason to give this disc a listen or purchase."
2,Disappointing,"There are some big indie names on this album and when I read about the Margate Exodus project the music seemed like a promising outgrowth. Unfortunately, most of the songs on this disk suck and those that don't arouse only mild interest. You'd do better to buy an individual album by one of the artists so unfortunately here -- say, 69 Love Songs by Magnetic Fields."
2,my buddy told me to get this,my buddy told me to get this. said it was the greatest thing in the world. tried it and it sux. i'm happier with the tube shaving cream much more protection and good smell.
5,Smooth shave,This product works equally well with a shaving brush or applied with your hand. The tube travels well and meets security rules for size.
5,best thing since sliced bread,This is the best shaving product I have ever used. I have pretty sensitive skin and I use to break out every time I would use edge so I would just use water and I still broke out. I switched to electric and still had issues. Then one of my friends offered to let me use this and I bought some after the first use. I never break or get ingrown hairs anymore. This stuff is a life saver for men who have to shave every day.
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I have a tendency to nick areas of the neck. Decided to buy this product despite not being the type to splurge on much for myself. At $16.00 for shave cream I'd consider this a splurge. Smells and feels nice, but doesn't do anything better than a can of Edge. I get better results using a good hair conditioner and it costs a lot less. Won't ever use this stuff again."
4,Beard Lube,"This product keeps my razor gliding along as I shave, and it has really reduced the red marks I get after I shave. Plus, it smells really good too."
5,Beard Lube from Jack Black,"Hands down, the best shaving lube ever produced! One more thing...buy it in this BIG STUPID 33oz. size! You can't go wrong."
2,Not for Everyone...,"JB makes some good products, but Beard Lube isn't one of them. I bought it once and hated it, but after reading these glowing reviews and being a fan of their excellent Face Buff, I gave it a second try. Both times, the same experience:It has a light and fresh feel, but it's too thin for me. It's watery, clear, and does not grip the skin. I found it difficult to know where I had applied it, and consequently, I often shaved the same spot several times which caused minor irritation. In other spots, my new blade would hydroplane right over the stubble, again requiring repeat passes. Every time I used this product I'd touch my face later in the day, and find a rough spot that I missed in the morning.Beard Lube isn't for me, but obviously, a lot of folks love the stuff. I recommend reading the reviews and the label carefully to see if it suits your shaving style, first."
5,AMAZING!!!!,"this's the most amazing shaving cream I've ever used and believe me, I've used a few!!! my neck's really sensitive to the razor, and until now, it'd get irritated EVERYtime I shaved - not so much with Jack Black!!! it's like the hair just wipes right off!!! it also smells REALLY good!!! how many shaving creams smell good??"
5,One of the best.,"I use this and also the Supreme Creme. Both are excellent-nice smooth, comfortable shave and it does not dry out your skin."
5,Jack Black Beard Lube Conditioning Shave-6 oz,Product arrived on time as promised. This is an excellent product. Since I started using it I rarely nick myself while shaving. After shaving the remaining product easily rinses off face and blade.
3,Beard Lube is mediocre...don't confuse with shave cream,"I recently tried the Beard Lube (3 in 1)...mediocre at best for use with a straight razor. It simply does not provide the lubrication that one needs with a straight blade. It might work better with a safety razor. I just find that a pre-oil with a solid shaving cream is better. That being said, it might be good for travel (i.e. carry on)I have not used the shaving cream, but I hear that it is terrific!"
4,Jack Black Beard Lube- Good Stuff,"I have used this daily for about five years. Much better than foam or gel. Lubricates better, not as messy. Seems to moisturize the skin well. As noted by other reviewer it is sometimes necessary to re-shave low-lying areas, but this is normal for a close shave. On most guy's faces all the hair does not grow in the same direction and it is necessary to attack from different angles. And Beard Lube lubricates so well no re-application is needed to re-shave. Most useful as a travel product, it's very easy to repackage into a small container and 100ml/3oz lasts me a couple of months. I dry my multiblade razor after each use which, along with periodic honing on denim, makes it last for months. No kidding. I lubricate the razor after drying which helps prevent micro-rusting on the blade. Some use shaving oil for this purpose but I find a tiny drop of Beard Lube works quite well and the razor is ready to go for the next shave."
2,Chintzy plastic,"This printer does a disservice to the rest of the HP line. The feed trays are flimsy to the point of being annoying. Manual feed of paper requires jiggling the top cover of the paper tray into a hidden slot above. Worst of all, the print quality is questionable. Vertical lines show a distinct edginess that is not found even on less expensive lasers from other manufacturers.Take a look at the brother HP-1250. 12ppm, better feed, better quality print, longer toner life, and the RAM is exapandable with standard, cheap 72-pin simms."
5,Fast and dependable printer,"I have bought 2 of these printers, one for my home office and one for my small workgroup at work. Both hang off of a server via a USB cable and are shared with multiple users. Fast, clear output, and no jams. Only problem we have had is that the copier function sometimes stops on the upgraded office model and we need to unplug the machine to reset it. Other than that, we are extremely pleased."
2,Cheaply Made,"It's so cheaply made, and it does NOT fit babies 0-6 months. I'd say 6 months plus unless you've got a 15 pound under 6 monther or heavier!"
4,Good scope,"it works... and is easy to mount, but adjusting it took about 30 minutes and LOTS of foul language. beware if its for a young child or already angry/tired person. but it does what a scope is supposed to do..."
4,Not too shabby!,"For the cost this is a good scope. Easy to set up and site in. The eye hole size is a bit small, but hey I'm not shooting at stuff 300 yards away! All things considered, I like it for my pellet gun to plink cans, or kill some nature."
1,A Complete Waste of Time,"When using this product, I tried to stay optimistic and overlook the fact that the ""raspberry scent"" barely covers the classic hair depilatory smell. But after actually using this product, my optimism has faded. Not only does it not remove hair in 4 minutes, it does not remove hair. It will eat up your time if you are a patient person, and in some cases, it will even irritate your skin. In general, Nair knock-offs are terrible. This is no exception."
2,Musician's Stool,"This product is way too heavy and awkward. I am very disappointed as I bought it as a gift and thought it would be the answer to a musician's dreams. As it turned out, not only is it awkward and heavy, he has already had to have the seat repadded for comfort.I would not recommend this product."
1,The Book Scared My Children,"We ordered the book through school. My 1st grade son can home and anounced that he received his book order and he had one book that would give him bad dreams. I looked through the book and found it was not quite what we had in mind. We were looking for something that would use the same old nursery stories, but with a difference. We wanted somthing to spark creativity and imagination, a look at adapting stories. It wasn't that kind of book. I felt it was scary and inappropriate for a young child.My son didn't want to keep it so we tried to donate it to the school library. The librarian looked at it and said he didn't like to censure books, but this book was just not something they really would like.We threw the book in the garbage."
4,Stevia Chewing Gum,"I found the gum to be very good and knowing that it didn't have aspertame in it was great! The flavor could have lasted a bit longer than it did and I was hoping it would be a little mintier tasting. But considering that there is no other gum that is sugar free and doesn't have aspertame in it that I know of I would buy this gum. I also think that the price is too high, so I will wait till it goes down before I start chewing it regularly."
4,"Awesome, natural gum.","If your grandmother ever told you that if you swallow your gum it will never be digested and it will stay in your body forever, she was wrong, at least when it comes to Steviadent Gum. All natural, nothing artificial, and nothing to feel bad about. And to top it all off, this is really tasty gum! Better than what you can get at the super market in terms of flavor and consistency. Do yourself a favor and try it."
4,Decent Gum,"I think this peppermint flavored gum is decent, and the flavor actually lasts longer then I expected it to. Was glad to find a gum that did not have Aspartame in it."
1,ALOHA....GOOD BYE! BOB!,THIS SOFTWARE DIDN'T WORK FOR ME! IT CRASHED BOTH MY COMPUTERS! DELL RECOMMENDED DETTO'S INTELLIMOVER. I CALLED THEM TO ORDER THE SOFTWARE AND IT WORKED LIKE MAGIC.INTELLIMOVER IS THE WAY TO GO IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRANSFER FILES FROM YOUR OLD COMPUTER TO YOUR NEW ONE.
5,Works Great,"--This review is for Version 4.0--I transferred some graphics programs (Photoshop, Quark, etc.) from a Windows 98 machine to a Windows XP system. Everything copied perfectly and all of the programs work.Just follow the prompts and read the directions while you use this program. (When you first install the software you will need an internet connection to download the latest version. I made a copy of that update file for the installation on the newer computer.)When you select programs to transfer, I recommend copying one program at a time - it takes longer, but to me it feels safer to test each one after installation. If you do it this way, plan on spending a while copying each program depending on the speed of your computer.I saved some PC Relocator files to a CD and others to a USB microdrive - both ways were fine. PC Relocator saves your previous computer settings in case you need to revert to them, but I didn't need to. This program worked really well for me."
4,One of the first modern poets,"Modernity is what defines the work of Baudelaire. No elegant poems of love; no countryside-dreaming; no evocation of the Classics nor references to the past. On the contrary: urban life; the alienation brought aboout by capitalism; the angst of poor urban dwellers; alcohol and drugs. Poetry is no more just the search for beauty through words. Now, it is a vehicle for the expression of the individual. Content is more important than form, and therefore Baudelaire gets rid of the constraints imposed by verse, even free verse, and lets his soul spill out in a not lyrical, but dark manner."
4,Evocative,"These prose poems were my first experience with Baudelaire. I didn't know what to expect, but they're pretty good. They are often vague, but even then manage to be evocative. I'll admit I also bought the book to help my French along (as it is bilingual), but it's Baudelaire and it's good and sometimes thought-provoking reading. Enivrez-vous! De vin, de poesie, de vertu, a votre guise. Enjoy."
5,I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IN WORDS !!!,"The old story is soooooooo moving , he promised to love and protect her and she gave everything up for him , their love was so pure ........ and the modern one is great ( as usual men are trying to be tough and stronge and love doesn't affect them ) but she made it true , she was able to move his feelings i think if u didn't read it , u missed a very beautiful two love stories"
2,"Ordered Aluminum, Amazon sent Steel","Sturdy, excellent fit, but unbelievably heavy. That's because I ordered aluminum risers and Amazon decided to send rolled steel. Amazon also dropped the price the day after they were delivered. Not impressed with Amazon this time. The risers, however, have me looking into bipods as my scrawny arms will have a tough time carrying my AR for more than an hour or so."
2,Disappointing Quality Control,"My PSLX350H turntable exhibited the same type of erratic speed that previous reviewers have noted. It ran well for about five minutes, but after that period, it was simply impossible to set a constant speed using the ""strobodots"" no matter how hard or often I tried. It seems pretty obvious that there must be some consistent defect in the motor or the control hardware, at least in examples coming to market in the past couple of months. At the very least, Sony's quality control is extremely disappointing for this model. I've arranged to send my unit back for a refund. The experience makes me yearn for a turntable like my father's old Thorens TD-265, which is still running flawlessly after some 28 years..."
3,Operating difficulties....,"I do believe that this turntable is of exceptional quality. The problem? Many complications to recieve a consistant audioplayback of an LP. When I had the inital adjustments correct, when playing an album, it continually needed adjustments. I found that to be aggravating, so I returned it due to frustration."
2,Great Sound when works,"I found exactly the same situation that the previous reviewer. For two weeks this turntable performed flawlessly, But this passed week I noticed significant variations in speed. I contacted Sony and they notified me that I am eligible for a refurbished replacement, although they currently have none available. They indicated they would contact me with other options once I ship the unit back to them. I am hoping they will refund my money and I'll look elsewhere for a more reliable turntable. I though I got a lemon until I read the previous review."
2,Poor quality belt drive,"I thought I would take a risk with this turntable after reading the warnings from the other reviews about the variations in the speed of the belt drive. This causes noticeable changes in the pitch of the recording making it sound like your guitars or singing are out of tune, and is more noticeable towards the end of the record. You can actually see the strobe dots speeding up and slowing down! I have sent mine back to sony for a refund. If it wasnt for this problem, it would have been a good turntable with solid construction and decent sound.I have had good experiences with sony but this is one that isn't one of them. Im not sure why sony is still selling this model after so many people are having the same problem. NOT recommended."
5,Great Bang for the Buck!,"I have an old late 70s Sony with a carbon fiber tonearm and fully automatic arm functions. This one does not have all of those features. BUT it tracks beautifully, speed is consistent, and the furnished Audio Technica cartridge is adequate. Of course the first thing I did was change out the cartridge to a Shure M97xE and now it makes me remember why I liked the sound of vinyl. CD's and MP3s are OK but with this turntable and the Shure cartridge you can really tell the difference! My records are being played again and the sound is terrific!"
4,Great item but needs a good external amp,"Great item but needs a good external amp to nice and strong sound. Good design, beautiful lines. Good option."
1,Sony denies obvious problem,"I just got off the phone with Sony and I had ended the conversation by telling them that I promised to write this review. I have two of these turntables in my home. One is fine and the other suffers from the known issue if having poor motors. The Sony guy said that since mine is out of warranty, they could only offer to exchange it for a refurbished unit at $112. Ha! It is out of warranty by about two months and only has about 3 hours of use on it. It suffers from the inconsistent speed problem that others complain of here. So . . . if you buy one of these -- put LOTS of time on it within the first year and send it back within that time for warranty repair if you have problems. Sony will NOT acknowledge these things have any problems or stand behind them!!! That equates to TERRIBLE customer service."
2,Buyer beware,"First, please note my comments relate to the 300 turntable, but they concern Sony service so they should be applicable to the other models as well. The 300 promises to record to computer but I followed the (minimal) instructions and nothing happened. So I used the phone and internet offered in the booklet, and both said they don't support the product (in whose booklet they appear). Wow. With this product Sony lies about everything! (Excuse me: it does play records.) I've had some dissatisfaction with Sony products before but this finishes my Sony purchasing. (I couldn't even complain to the company without mentioning a product -- at which point they said, again, that there was no email ""support"" for this product.)"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!! Belt drive STOPS working!!,"Or for that matter check to see whether the record player uses a belt drive. If so, I highly suggest you stay away from ANYTHING with a belt drive! Several years ago I was not satisfied with one. This version was an even worse experience. After a couple of plays not only did the belt drive STOP, but the speed was all wrong for both 33 and 45!! In order to get the 45 to sound right, I had to put it on 33 and when I tried to play a 33 record it sounded like a 78!! And then the turntable STOPPED rotating completely. And yes, I checked: the belt was still in place!!One other thing: when I hooked this unit up to my CD burner, the sound level wasextremely low and barely audible.I can't believe that SONY would produce junk like this!!"
4,A Gift!,Ordered this sony turntable and arived remarkabley ontime everything looks good but as of this review this product was for a gift so i really cant review about the preformance..........
4,A turntable of excellent value!,"I bought this turntable several years ago and this is a turntable of excellent value! Never had any problems with it whatsoever. The only thing that keeps this turntable a rating of 5 or more is the design....it is FULLY MANUAL and so when the record is finished playing you have to lift the needle up yourself;therefore, it would have been better if it were at least semi-automatic, huh? Following the instructions in the manual is satisfactory in termsof adjusting the correct tonearm weight via the counter weight device...I had to experiment awhile until I found the best weight...but, when I found it, it was HEAVEN!The cartridge or needle that went with the turntable is good - noticed a great projection is sound. My final thought is this: if you have a great receiver and great speakers, this turntable will be a great add-on feature.Also, the price is right and also...THIS IS A SONY - A GREAT NAME YOU CAN TRUST! -John, Southern California."
1,Misguided,"This author lacks serious academic credentials. He provides little in the way of facts, but plenty in the way of opinions. His philosohpy of economic growth has been thoroughly discredited among leading economists. His recommendations sound good, but the economy just doesn't work that way."
1,DON'T BUY,"Upon receipt of the Foodsaver, it wouldn't work. I called the Foodsaver customer service and they said the rubber gasket that was needed to fix it (a $1 part) was no longer manufactured. The rep also informed me that the foodsaver I had bought was phased out but had been bought up by Amazon and stores like Big lots. Beware!"
3,Definitely for Experts,"This book is an in-depth explanation of Lhotka's CSLA .NET framework. It starts out by showing you how the framework was built. Then it shows you how to use it. A beginner should not read this book. It's very technical. I'm not a beginner but I'm also not an expert and there were points where I just gave up on understanding how he built the framework. As I gain more .NET experience, I plan to go back and read the first part of the book again.I've been desperately look for a C# book that discussed a 3-tier architecture and how it should be applied in .NET. This book does show you how it can be done but it's very complicated.In reading this book, I've gained a good understanding of what can be accomplished by using a well thought out framework. Am I using it? No. I got too confused trying to implement it. That doesn't mean I don't want to use it. It just means that my experience level at the moment is holding me back."
5,wanna learn OO in C#??,After carefully going through one c# book on design patterns. I had anticipated that going through the lhotka c# business objects book would be a breeze but boy was I wrong. Mr. Lhotka uses OO to the extreme in his framework and outlines his reasons behind tailoring the OO to his base classes in his framework unlike other book. Design patterns are for small apps. Enterprise applications take advice from this book. I have yet to see another book with this kind of detail and quality.This books is as good as his c# 1.1 book.I have noticed that it helps to know his c# 1.1 businessobject book first since this 2005 book builds on top ofthe first so it's good to have both projects (1.1 and 2.0)open side to see the improvements.Covers improvement in architecture from the csla frameworkwhilst taking advantage of the new c# 2.0 features.
5,Great stuff!,"With friends like the Brecker Brothers, (RIP Michael) you can't go wrong. Randy does a lovely job on ""Imagine"" and Michael absoulutely tears up ""Working Class Hero"" Not a weak track to be found. Great job from Dave Kikoski and friends."
4,Jazzy and thoughtful,The musicians chosen for this album are outstanding. They give heartfelt renderings of some great Beatle's tunes with the added mastery of fine Jazz playing. Inventive and enjoyable without being just another adaptation.
1,"""AWFULLY BAD"" products for 4x DVD Writer","If your DVD writer is slightly old - like capable of burning with 4x speed, DO NOT buy this product even for a penny!!!Not a single DVD will work!! And your DVD writer could get damaged if you retry burning several times with these OWFULLY BAD dvds. MEMOREX 8x DVD are nothing but a JUNK!!!"
3,"Junk for movies, fine for data","They seem fine for archiving purposes, but for video use they are not read by any of my DVD machines - 2 in house, 1 portable, 2 in cars. The only device that can read them are the PCs. I threw away 5-6 before I gave up and went and bought some cheaper ones that worked fine. Go figure."
1,Data Gone!!!,On some of the dvds data is simply gone and my machine cant read them anymore. I'm pretty sure it has to do with the cheap dye they use. Once again- you get what you pay for!
2,2 many bad disks,"after disk are burned, you can see where the ink or dye runs together in spots, and makes the disk worthless....I have been using Sony and TDK now and no problems"
1,thomas,"this is a bad product, i got two hundred disc and all are useless.they are made by cmc but the ad does not tell you that. the disc did not work in nec 3500, hp300n, or liteon dvdrw. i had to throw all disc in trash. i got in contact with memorex and they emailed me a link to the product replacement department. i filled out all the information and never got a response."
1,Memorex is the worst!,"These DVDs won't even burn on my Sony DRX-710UL. The response I got from Sony was basically that they consider Memorex media garbage. They even recommended me to a list of ""good"" companies DVDs to buy. I went to Memorex and asked them about the problem with their DVDs. They told me to go to Sony ( my burner provider ) about their latest firmware. I downloaded the firmware and the DVD burner still just spits it back out saying it can't write on this disc. So thanks for nothing Memorex! You're the worst! I purchased a 50pk Memorex DVD-R 16x Printable spindle and used Nero 6 and Nero Express 2 if that helps. Yes I realize that these aren't the Printable versions, but there really isn't much difference."
1,Worthless,"I've had two sets of Memorex DVD-R discs and no matter what they last a year at best, burned or not. Save yourself alot of headaches and spend an extra $5 dollars on another brand that actually works."
5,Great product,"All the dvds i burned on these disc were great. I used DVD-R and DVD+R by memorex. I had the same problems as the person below where the disc would burn perfectly but it wouldnt play anywhere. Its not the discs' fault, Did you check the compatibilty of the disc to the player? I hadnt updated my FIRMWARE and the dvds were not playable anywhere, it showed a succesful burn but would not play. AFter I learned that I had to update my firmware The dvds I burned were just fine."
2,Worst Discs Ever,"I've burned almost 100 Memorex 8X discs in four different PC DVD Burners. Roughly 1/4 errored during the burn. Of those that burned, over 1/2 pixelate and lock up when played on PC or home DVD player. My firmware is up to date and I haven't had this much trouble with any other DVD-R except for Staples brand. I give them 2-stars since they do work well in my home theater DVD Burners but only in Standard Play mode and at 1X burn speed. In EP or faster burn modes, they pixelate."
1,These do not work with the burner i bought,"I have tried these dvdrs with the burner i bought from amazon and they do not work, i will try them again and send an email to you. I bought a few imation to try in the burner to ensure it wasnt faulty and they worked!!! what is up with these dvds??"
5,"Well written, and informative","A good book to keep in reach whether you're looking for a refresher, or to learn new processes, techniques, etc. I've got some experience with wireless (although not a guru), and I learned some new stuff... A good book written by authors with obvious wireless experience."
3,Mafia Summer,"I am still reading it, but so far it is a fun read. Very enjoyable.I would recommend it to a friend."
4,Well worth the time.,"I enjoyed this book immensely, but the Kindle edition had some issues from the conversion that should have been eliminated in proofreading. Though became thought, noting became nothing, a different character's name was inserted, places where hyphens weren't removed, page breaks not edited, and a couple of instances where pure gobbledegook was inserted. Aside from the sloppy proofreading in the Kindle edition, I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story."
3,"Initially slow, but enjoyable overall (especially for the mafia enthusiast)","The book, as told through the eyes of an 18 yr old, takes place over the course of one summer in 1950. There were so many characters and not much is happening in the first half so it seemed to drag while you are getting to know the gang, their parents, and the mafia families. It takes a while to get through all this background and while not boring, it seems a bit slow. Half way through, when you know everyone, the book starts to fly, the plot moves quickly, then bamm, you're done, with a few pages to wrap it all up. I enjoyed it because I enjoy the mafia topic in general and am glad I read it, but it does lack something. It might have flowed easier as a movie."
1,Poorly written and not interesting,"If you were thinking this book would be another Wiseguy, it won't. If you were thinking this book would hold your interest for more than 5 pages, it won't either. It is just plainly boring. Pass and move on to something else."
4,Very good!,I The book was very well written and was very descriptive. I enjoyed reading it! It was a mini mob history made interesting.
3,Just OK,"I wouldn't give this novel a sterling rating since it's a cliche-ridden piece of work. On the other hand, I did read it to the end so I guess I sort of liked those chiches in spite of myself."
3,Good Summer read but..........,this is a good summer read. It reminded me a little in the style like the outstanding book Wise Guys which latter was made into the movie Goodfellas. This book is no were near that. The book Wise Guys is probably one of the best ever written on the topic of the mafia in their everyday life. This book had some story lines that we not quite believable such as the relationship with Stanley and Vinnie studying together at the library. Yet the author did reseach on the names of the families of the mob in nyc and it was a nice summer read.
3,Mafia Summer,"I liked the book. I might have even given it a 4 star if it wasn't for the inaccuracies. As a lover of mob books and mob movies, it never ceases to amaze me how the writers/editors/ producers, directors can mess up the name of the town in upstate NY where the 1957 chase through the woods occurred. It is APALACHIN, NY (pronounced Ap-a-lake-in, not APPALACHIAN. Those are mountains in eastern North America. The name of the mobster whose house was raided in Apalachin was Joseph Barbara (pronounced Bar-bare-a, not spelled Barbera, and not pronounced Bar-ba-ra. I grew up in that area, and it makes me nuts when I read/hear the mispronunciations. I suppose someone will come back and say that the mobsters weren't too swift. Okay, but it still makes it all the more credible when the names are spelled and pronounced correctly. Now I've vented, all is good."
2,It is OK novel,"I believe I already reviewed it. The novel started good and expected to be different from usual mafia based stories. To some extent, author achieved that goal but could have dome it better. The teenage gang succeeded in quitting the profession but after too much violence. Also, poor Sydney did not have to die."
3,Not great not lousy,"Good character development, it's a quick read, not a waste of time but wouldn't recommend it either. Does give some insight into the Mafia."
4,"Not the Godfather, but still pretty good","I haven't read many mobster books, but I thought this one was reasonably entertaining. It has the standard family alliances, double-crosses, and power struggles you'd expect. The protaganist is a punk gang leader with a softer side exhibited in his involvement in an unlikely friendship with a Jewish bookworm neighbor. Don't worry, this doesn't keep him on the straight and narrow. There should be enough violence, crime, and sex to keep fans of the genre happy.The writing style could have used some work (or maybe just a better edit). For the most part it's first person narrative, but it was interspersed with details that could only be known by an omniscient third person."
3,Good story,Easy fast read that gives the chacters a chance to develop. It's not the Godfather but allows you to venture into the makings of the underworld.
3,Different angle on an old story,"This story follows a young man through a summer of mob family escapades with emphasis on his relationship with a Jewish neighbor. The story holds your attention and is not what you might expect from a book with that title. Not on a par with the Godfather, but then what is?"
3,Mafia Summer was not bad,The story was interesting and the characters believable. It's not The Godfather but it's an interesting view of the times. Please inform the author that you cannot put a silencer on a revolver. Not a big detail but bad guys should know these things
4,Summer Mafia,Great story that was most interesting to me living through those times historically myself. It was a time that can't be repeated in just that way with the families as shown as the old gang went onto other things.
4,Emotive and thought provoking,"I studied this book as part of my A level Spanish course and found that avid readers who didn't study Spanish were missing out on a great experience! While the story of ""El Coronel"" is a simple, rather uncomplicated one, it deals with contempory and historical social issues in a thoughtful and interesting way. The way it is written evokes great sympathy and pity in the reader for both the Colonel and his wife, but particuarly the former with his child-like innocence and continuing sense of hope. It is not an inaccurate description of how many lives were (and still are) at the time in Colombia...therefore you realise that there's always someone else worse off than yourself! An excellent read."
1,Worst buying experience ever,"I bought the depot diaper bag from this company twice! First they sent the wrong bag and never returned contact. The second time was on a time limit, so I ordered with UPS next day delivery. I never received the bag. I called every day for a week, and no one answered the phone. When I e-mailed they said they would look into it, and I never heard from them again. Their diaper bag is well organized and easy to use. Their customer service is so terrible that I will never use them again. They are without a doubt the worst company I have ever had dealings with."
1,"Author paid for his ""degree""","He is NOT a doctor. The only degree he has is from a unaccredited CORRESPONDENCE school!!! It was shut down by court order in 2001. He paid $72 for his ""degree"". He is now involved in Oasis Life Sciences, a MLM selling junk."
4,effective advice,"If you drink a lot of [...] daily, especially coffee, you should read this. Just switching from coffee to regular tea has helped me massively--less [...]. Less heart palpitations, much more energy(I can immediately swim far more laps) and more. Bothersome situations now seem petty. Psychologically you will see that petty things are indeed petty. Those who have an immediate reaction against thie information are almost certainly addicted to [...]--I understand, I am too. Withdraw gradually and you will see your negativity is the reflex of the addict. And good luck, do it! As far as the author's credentials: his corresspondence university diploma is wallpaper as far as I am concerned. But the information in the book works. I don't have a degree in nutrition either, but I know it works."
5,"Most excellent, well-written, informative book","Read this last year and am re-reading it now. Bears re-reading because it's full of information, a lot to digest.The author clearly presents the damaging effects of caffeine abuse, how it can lead to depression and fatigue.Full of facts, studies and statistics, yet eminently readable. Highly recommended."
3,There's more to the caffeine story than only negatives,"Caffeine is known to be a weak drug with a range of mixed reactions, from a group who feels caffeine is beneficial, to others who see it as neutral, and to still others who view it as detrimental. Caffeine is actually known to temporarily boost mood for some people vs cause the blues in all people. Perhaps the best known story relating caffeine to paying attention is the book How to Cure Hyperactivity (ADHD)(1981) by Dr. Anita Uhl Brothers, M.D., of Berkeley, California and C. Thomas Wild which reports that caffeine compounds can temporarily reduce distractibility and increase attention span for a small subgroup of those with Attention Deficit Disorder (and actually work better and with less side effects than Ritalin). Both Dr. Brothers, M.D. and C. Thomas Wild call for better labeling for all products containing caffeine so consumers who are sensitive to caffeine can avoid it if they so choose."
5,"finally, the incentive I need to kick the coffee habit","I like this book so much, I've been sending copies to my friends -- something I've never done before. For years, I've read about the harmless effects of caffeine, but deep down, I knew it was causing some very negative feelings.This book explains everything and points out dozens of things you've never suspected. The writing is both engaging, scientific, and thoroughly convincing.I highly recommend it to anyone who suspects caffeine plays a part in their mood and overall health. You will be amazed at the numbers of ways it may be interfering with your well-being."
5,Wake Up Call-Caffeine Blues,"This is an incredible wake up call. It's obvious to most consumers caffeine isn't a ""good"" thing and ""moderation"" is acceptable. Taken a deeper dive into what really happens to the body and the body's response to caffeine, this book lays it out in simple, scientific terms and facts. If you want to prolong your life, read this book...start now.Fit4life"
4,Informative,"Every caffeine user should own a copy as the book is easy to understand, and the author does a good job informing the public about caffeine's effects. Thanks, Mr. Cherniske. The layperson deserves more books like yours."
1,Pseudo Science Blues,"This book is junk science. The author doesn't know anything about caffeine. For example, he claims that caffeine ages you because it is dehydrating. Caffeine is NOT dehydrating-- that is proven by every scientific study! And, in fact, caffeine is a strong anti-oxidant,so it actually prvents aging. If you want to read serious, well-researched book about caffeine, read The World of Caffeine, by Weinberg and Bealer. If you want to read a great self-help book about how to use caffeine safely to get benefits for your mind and body, read The Caffeine Advantage by the same authors.By the way, it's funny, but Cherniske, the big anti-caffeine man, admits that he uses caffeine regularly and that it makes him feel great!!"
5,The book that saved my life.,"""Caffeine Blues"" has definently added valuable years to my life? I was a typical coffeholic on a crash course with exhaustion, depression, anxiety, blood sugar swings, clogged arteries, you name it. The Caffiene Blues opened my eyes and answered my many questions all in a wonderfully written informative 300 plus pages. I would recommend it to anyone who is wondering why they feel so old and tired at such a young age."
5,Great for de Lint collectors and students,"This is a reader-demand collection of stories, some published as much as 25 years ago and long out of print, and some never before published at all. The stories are all great reading, even if the author is charmingly apologetic about their quality. His imagination shines like the light of multi-colored moons over undiscovered worlds. The new cover art and original illustrations are a pure delight.Mr. de Lint's work, both old and new, is particularly appealing to me as a student of story-telling in the long tradition. I am definitely a ""glutton for punishment"", as he describes us, and hope for more."
1,Waste of Money,"I wasted $200 by purchasing the router. Wireless connection keep dropping every two days and you need to reset the router, wireless range is very less when compared to WRT54. Stay away from the router. I really don't understand how linksys can release such a worst product."
2,"A good product function-wise, but a big disappointment when putting into use","This product is a good for my need: 802.11N and a built-in media server to serve the D-Link DSM-320 media player I bought. The built-in ftp server and remote access to storage is also I want.However, this unit doesn't provide internet connectivity after setup. The setup procedure is straightforward and easy to follow. I can see the router obtained the DHCP IP address via the cable modem. But in the end, I cannot reach internet from my LAN PCs. It appears the NAT function simply breaks.I am on the latest firmware. I am waiting for the response from Linksys Tech support before I can decide what to do next.A big disappointment considering the band recognition Linksys receives."
5,Buy it.,"Not sure why people don't like it, works great for me. No lost connections and my PS3 works well with it. 2girls1cup plays just fine, couldn't ask for anything else."
4,Needs documentation.,"Received the router and got it up and running with no problems - but I am familiar with linksys routers. The storage link documentation is lacking at best. I was able to finally stumble through and get it working as a FTP server, but if you ain't a network engineer, you might be puzzled as to how to set it up. It is a share on a network, not a stand-alone like you would think. Gave it a 4 cause of documentation. Otherwise, kicks."
2,Avoid this product if you use more than one wireless connection,"The firmware has serious problems in many areas:NAT: doesn't save settings, you must try more times before getting it rightWireless connection: if you have more computers connected the connection will drop continuously. Even every 2-3 minutesUSB storage: Very limited features and many times it doesn't work or save settings.From time to time you need to reset it because the DHCP server stops working.If connected through DHCP to the provider, it won't rapidly recover from a connection drop.The only positive thing about this router is the easy to use management web interface.My suggestion is to avoid this product because it needs a new, more reliable, firmware."
1,Save your money and more importantly time!,"This product is horrible. I couldn't get it to work with my DSL out of the box. I called tech support (India) and they were no help. I finally connected my old router, downloaded the latest firmware and got it working on my own only to find that performance was horrible. Wireless range and data transfer speeds are sub-par and Internet performance was worse than my previous router. It barely works with my Xbox 360, I had to modify multiple setting just to get my xbox to connect to live. I strongly advise you not to waste your time and money on this product. I replaced my WRT350N with a DLink DGL-4500 and had it up and running perfectly in 5 minutes. Performance, range and internet on the Dlink have all been great. Xbox live worked with minimal configuring which the Dlink automatically does for you if you select live under the gaming category in its setup."
2,Not very friendly with other devices,"After a week of testing I returned this product. I'll wait for Version 2 of the hardware, which is supposed to come out soon.I had problems in particular with a Core 2 Duo Mac Book Pro, which kept dropping the connection.I went back to the faithful WRT-54GS V4, which is 100 times more reliable but limited to b/g.After making a lot of online research, I believe it's better to wait for newer N models in general.I plan to try the Apple one when it comes out or the WRT-350N V2."
3,mmmm...,"ok... here's the thing:I bought the router... I have a windows vista pc... and a ""mybook"" usb harddisk... my brother didn't have any problem connecting with the mybook plugged in into the storage link cause he has a windows XP pc... bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbuuuuuuuuuttttttt... I did... so I did a little research at the linksys website and it said that I had to upgrade the firmware... fine.. I did it...the whole thing crashed... I had to contact linksys to fix the problem... and still... when I thought that it was working fine... It started to freeze. I had to turn off and on every hour...The only thing that I could do to finally fix the router... (is how i have it right now) is using an open source firmware... and STIIIILLLL the storage link doesn't work... BUUUT is better than nothing...I like linksys... I never had a problem with linksys untill now..."
4,Linksys WRT350N Wireless-N Gigabit Router with Storage Link,The software setup is easy it is fast on the host computer but the range leaves a little to be desired.
3,Great Hardware Very Very Poor Firmware,"This Box Is Great Piece of Hardware but the LinkSYS standerd firmware sucks, it needs a reboot daily because it hangs and the performance of the USB is very very slowI had to change the firmware to the dd-wrt firmware and now we can play.It is very good box if you are a computer geek because you will learn how to handle and fix it.If you are a regular user do not try to buy it or you will get very disappointed."
3,A mixed but ultimately disappointing bag from Linksys,"This is my third Linksys router, and in general I have been very pleased with their products. I bought this one for the claimed increased range, and I was also interested in the storage link feature.Basic setup was a breeze, and the router came up on my home network flawlessly in a matter of minutes. The range is noticeably better than my trusty 54G, but not by much. I was certainly expecting more based on the claims.The storage link feature is very confusing. I was unable to use it with my Drobo, which works perfectly as a directly attached device. The documentation of this feature is completely inadequate, and judging by the experiences reported here, calling Linksys customer service is not much help. Storage link may indeed work in some cases, but I am unwilling to make the investment of time in phone calls to figure out how to get it to work for me. I have to agree with others here that Linksys has released this product prematurely."
1,"WRT350N, Avoid This Product As Though It Was The Black Death","I purchased this router after having the Linksys 802.11G product. I was looking forward to the external USB storage connection as well as the suppossed speed increase. I provide IT support for a major corporation and I consider myself to be a fairly advanced user. I made every attempt to make this product work with some stability with absolutley no success. Updated firmware, various configurations of Wireless settings etc. From what I can tell the biggest problem is that this product really does not know how to deal with any other wireless networks that might be near by. I get ""Excellent"" signal strength, at least that's what the Linksys utility says, but I get only 6 Mbps throughput and the connection drops every few minutes. And yes I found the setting to force it higher. So unless you live on an island with no other inhabitants, avoid this product as though it was the black death."
4,Five years running and mostly solid. It's time to move on.,"I have had this router for at least five years now and it's been a pretty good product, for what it was meant to do. It's range isn't the best but for it's age, what do you expect. Early on I played around with open source firmwares that were fun to use but went back to stock for stability reasons. I will probably get another Linksys, a Netgear or maybe the Asus; I'm not sure just yet. I need something geared more for better range and QoS. One problem I always had with this unit is it would get hot and after watching a couple of movies on Netflix, it would require a reboot. In general, it needs a reboot every now and again as performance starts to degrade. I got my money's worth and if you get a used one that works you'll have a decent router. It's got a USB slot on it as well that I used at one point with no issues."
3,Good if you don't want to do any port forwarding or advanced functions,"This router works good if all you want is an Internet connection for casual surfing. Shortly after I open a port for forwarding traffic, the router locks up and I have to reset it. This is a low end router. The price for this average router should be from $50 to $70."
2,Don't Pay Too Much,"The price was great I can't deny that, I paid $65. But the product has some complications. Such as losing connectivity from time to time out of no where. I believe Linksys is working on a new firmware to update this issue. If this product is over a $100.....DON'T BUY IT."
1,Storage Link Does NOT Work,"The Storage Link on the Linksys WRT350N does NOT work.I have tried more than once, in different configurations, and it does not work. Period. Upgrading the firmware will not resolve the issue.If you have folders and files on an existing USB drive and then attach it to the router, they will not appear as they should. Directories will appear as subdirectories of others in cases where they really are not. In other words, directory A will appear beneath directory B even when it is not! It's simply WRONG.Also, it is absolutely impossible to assign read/write permissions for different users to different folders. 75% of the time the router software will not save your changes. Even when it does save your changes, randomly, the security permission will not work as you define them.Do not buy this product."
5,A must for cat-lovers,"Those who adore cats like nothing better than trading stories of their own pets' loving, independent, idiosyncratic personalities. Writer-entertainer Harry Cauley has been foster dad to a long list of felines who have shared his life and he, in turn, is enthusiastic about sharing their stories with us. Like an over-idulgent, proud grandpa wisking out the walletful of grandkids' photos (yes, the book has pictures too) Cauley charmingly and affectionately recalls the oddities, tricks, and foibles of the many little friends who have enriched his life."
4,Hubris meets Homoeroticism,"I give this book 4 stars for its inadvertently hysterical comedy. Everything you need to know to understand how the tech bubble formed and why it burst so dramatically is here--not in the story the author tells, but in the pseudo-macho, we-are-the-masters-of-the-universe, lets-measure-each-other's-penises subtext that runs throughout.This is cultural history at its best. Not unlike the sex-ed books of the '50s and '60s that give us fascinating glimpses of the contemporary oppression of women, this book accidentally paints the late '90s silicon valley as the hotbed of homoeroticism that it was. The characters are greedy, hubris-filled, and completely blinded by the slightest scent of money--and the author worships their every move and utterance, seeing them as they see themselves: as gods among mere mortals.There's not much here for the businessman, but plenty for the cultural historian."
4,"Good, but the second one is better","This book is very good, it entertained me, but I enjoyed the 2nd book in the series better. This also caputres the naievete of a three month old in a 20 yer old persons body. Very interestin."
4,I'm happy with it,"It sounds great I am happy with it, just 2 let you know its not as loud as it looks but it sounds good you can carry it on your shoulder(I take it 2 work every day) and it still has plenty of bump. P.S. it still is loud its just that by looking at it you would think it would break glass."
4,Nice box...,"This box is pretty much what I hoped it would be... a modern replacement for my failing Hitachi 3D7 box from 1984. It's great to have a remote finally!The Good:- MP3 disks play very well.- iPod integration works well, even with remote.- Sound is loud and clear.The Bad:- MP3 player whines a few times per song, when reading data. Annoying at low volumes.- iPod hanging off the boom box with a cord is a poor solution.- The unit is not really a cylinder like it appears to be in photos. The shape bulges out very far in the rear, in a way that no true boom box should. I smashed my hip trying to carry this thing with the carry strap-- good luck with that!!! Strap looks cool but is a joke to actually use.The Ugly:- I'll go ahead and say it: This thing is big and ugly. Very tacky looking. That said, I'm getting used to it now that I've had it a couple weeks..."
2,Not Pleased,I purchased this product to use as a portable radio. For this purpose the product was not functional since the tuner component is very weak and would not even pick up relatively strong FM stations. I did find that the sound quality was good if I used it as a CD player.
1,Not a comic,"This is an illustrated story not a comic book. I haven't read it yet, so no rating, but I was surprised when I got it, and i wasn't terribly happy about it."
3,An EP for the fans,"The EP. It has been said that in the modern age the EP is more of a marketing tool than anything else but in this case Edguy seem to be using this release as a single that also allows them to clear out some finished tracks that didn't make it to the last album.So the bad news first. It's more of the same. Which when it comes to Edguy is usually great with me but tracks like Holy Water do tend to drone a little.The good news is that if your a fan of Edguys last two monumentally great albums then you really need to buy this. Not to mention the smile that will play across your lips when you listen to the last track of this EP and read the lyrics (which are included which is a nice touch for an EP release). I won't spoil it for you by talking any further about it here.But for the price at the time of writing, any Edguy fan should pick this up."
1,Stupidity...at it's finest!,"I've been an Edguy fan for quite some time, and this EP is very disappointing, to say the least! If fans want to lower their standards and swallow anything a band throws at them, then go ahead! As for the fan that made the comment, since when did metal fans become born again Christians? My response to that is, try having some standards for yourself! It's not a question of being or not being a Christian! In my eyes, Edguy has lowered the standards of their music to the nu-metal level, and quite honestly, the band is better than that! The bottom line is, the music itself is really good, but the lyrics are very bad and distasteful! Hopefully, this EP isn't an accurate reflection of the upcoming album, but we'll see...."
3,I'm underwhelmed,"I had hoped for somewhat better clarity and ink distribution, but the colors are not well distributed and does not duplicate the original paintings. Cutting these double-sheets is a chore. My paper cutter just bends the sheet, and scissors are required. It claims to work with hp ink but somehow it seems less than ideal."
4,intersting reading,"For those of you who want to know how it was to be a reporter back in the 70s and 80s, this book should be interesting to you. As a reporter of the 90s myself, I found it to be entirely a different world."
3,Liked his writing; dislike his politics,"Rather has revealed himself, rather unattractively, as a journalistic liberal and that doesn't excite me. We're apparently miles apart in some of our values. However, I found his book quite interesting. Understandably, he's a very fine writer and he kept me reading with his unique journalistic experiences. He wryly relates an anecdote reflecting how much his job consumed him. He was home for a brief time between assignments and his son was watching TV in the living room with a friend. When Rather appeared on a newscast, the other child asked, ""Who is that man?"" Rather's son answered matter of factly, ""Oh, that's Dan Rather."" That's when Rather realized he hadn't exactly bonded much with his son. Years have passed since I read the book but that story has stuck in my mind. I would recommend the book."
3,Good walleye primer,"Good book for teaching the basics of walleye fishing. It is geared more for a person with a boat. I use a canoe in the BWCA so the techniques outlined are a little bit of a challenge to use without a motor, depth finder and other gear. But basically helpful for knowing where to look and how to increase success rates for a novice like myself."
3,good well written easy reading book,Great book about Thomas Chaplin and His history on St. helena Island. Really gets you to know what life was like in antebellum South.
1,It could be better,"This album is not all it's cracked up to be. Australian music is different, but it can be addicting if you listen to it and develop a fine taste for their style and culture."
1,Pretty good while it worked.,"I really liked this product while it worked, which was about 2 weeks. Now it goes through all the motions, but hardly any water comes out. It has only been used about 10 times. The manual does not have a trouble-shooting guide."
5,Great little coffee maker!,"This thing is perfect if you hate coffee that's been sitting around in a pot! I work at home, so drink a fair amount of coffee throughout the day...I used to hate it after its been sitting in a pot (even one not on a hotplate in an insulated carafe) for more then an hour. This little gem is the solution - makes a quick, hot, FRESH cup every time.Can't say enough good things about it ... it even makes tea!"
5,Wonderful,Any child that reads this book will enter into a magical world......I am now 34 yrs old....I read this book as a child and still remember liking the stories.......I am originally from Guyana formally British Guiana......I grew up on all Enid Blyton books....they are a delight to read.......this is one book I suggest you get for you children.
5,Best children's book author,Enid Blyton is the best. I grew up on her books and on reading Harry Potter was immediately reminded of her works. I tried to find her books a few years ago in the US and didn't have much luck. I am glad Amazon is carrying these now. I have started collecting her books for my future children and nieces and nephews. Undoubtedly the best books for children!
2,How many pretty pictures do you want to pay for?,"About half of this 64-page book is actual training advice. The other half consists of filler in the form of pretty dog pictures. For $1 more you can get Shirlee Kalstone's ""How to Housebreak Your Dog in Seven Days"" -- 70 pages of training advice (similar to Kelly's) plus background not in Kelly's book that will be useful to many readers."
4,Very good guide.,This guide helped me BUNCHES with my Crystal Version. This has;A calender of eventsA walkthroughA breeding sectionA pokedex guide to 251 pokemon (missing out Celebi)It is VERY GOOD. ^_^
4,"Beautiful Guide, Can be helpful...","This guide is good. but not too much. It didn't give me much help on the unown puzzle. I recommend you buy this game guide if you really want it, or get the versus book or the nintend guide."
5,Brillas cuando crees en los Maestros,"Una de las cosas más difíciles es creer que existen otros Maestros Ascendidos como Jesús y que tengan una enseñanza práctica y sencilla. Este libro me dejó pensando mucho, abrió mi mente y mi corazón, para creen en otros Maestos Ascendidos. Gracias a Saint Germain seguí buscando más de éste conocimiento, el cual meha facilitado el sendero de retorno al Padre, te lo recomiento."
5,Amor entre Hermanos,"En esta libro el Maestro Saint Germain nos ofrece la maravillosa instrucción del ""YO SOY"". Fue el primer libro del Maestro que llegó a mis manos como -El libro de Oro- y me introdujo a la práctica de los decretos según mi entendimiento en ese tiempo. Se percibe el Amor del Maestro Saint Germain por el Amado Jesús, haciéndonos caer en la cuenta de la importancia de los decretos que Él utilizó en Su Ministerio. Este libro es mágico y contiene y explica el uso del ""YO SOY"" para cada circunstancia de nuestras vidas. Gracias Maestro Saint Germain."
5,Beautiful!,"The artwork in this book is absolutely beautiful. Although not a very long book, the layout shows true artistic taste. There is a detailed drawing of each facade that opens up to show the building's interior. These drawings are complimented with photographs of the buildings and their contents. The book focuses on St. Peter's, Buckingham Palace, the Paris Opera, Neuschwanstein (castle), and Monticello. I particularly enjoyed the sections on the Opera and on Monticello. There were so many interesting little facts!"
3,Kind of disappointed,"I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but this book did not impress me as much as the other reviews I've read. There is good information to be found inside the book; but I feel that the ""lessons"" are too long. Buy it in the need to gain knowledge, but don't buy it thinking you'll use the lessons already marked out."
3,Robert Smith Plays on Only Two Tracks,"FYI to Cure fans: Robert Smith plays guitar on the track ""There's a Planet in My Kitchen"" and sitar on ""The Whole Price of Blood."" Per the liner notes, none of the other songs feature any input from him, including the ones from around the time he was a member of the band."
5,Great box set !,"It has been a long time since I have heard a lot of these songs, and was very excited to see that it was released. Especially the Thorn EP... Some of the best Siouxsie ever!!"
4,Down Side Up,"As is the case with most every box set I have ever purchased, this B-sides collection is all over the place, much like the Cure's Join the Dots. It goes from jaw-dropping, astonishing brilliance to total ""WTF?!"" indulgence in the span of moments. And its sheer size makes it virtually impossible to sit down and listen to in one go. Having said all that, this is a career-spanning set of songs that absolutely must be heard, as the Banshees habitually hid some of their greatest material on the flip sides of their singles. Some of it insanely good, some of it not. But it simply can not be ignored."
4,Great sound!,"Great sound from a small system...a bit more confusing to operate than I'd expected, but I'm not technologically inclined!! Getting used to it... Having some trouble w/ CD player.hoping to resolve that ASAP."
4,Amazons of Black Sparta: The women awrriors of Dahomey,"This was an interesting historical book about an obscure group of fiercely proud African women warriors. It has convinced me that the ""myth"" of ""Amazon"" warriors is not really a myth at all."
2,Book was too classroom type writting,"This book had some good parts, good history lessons, good research done. BUT, the writer was pretty classroom boring with the story, could have been a better read with a little more imagination thrown in."
2,Mediocre,The first chapter or two were OK then it jsut got repetitive with a few nuggets of new information scattered through. I didn't finish the book which is sad as it seemed to have the potential to be an excellent topic.
2,Buyer Beware,"When my Panasonic, no longer under warranty, needed a repair, I discovered that I had two options, either throw it away or buy a rebuilt player. The problem was a dead backlight, something that should have been a simple repair, but due to way machine is designed turns out not to be. I bought the rebuilt player and that was defective. It does come with a 90 day warranty, but local certified Panansonic dealer won't honor it. And on and on the story goes.So beware, product was good, but once something happens and you enter the service system, you will experience frustrations."
3,broken player rats!,We have had this player for about 2 years and loved it until it broke. We bought the extra battery pack which gave us aproximately 5-6 hours total playing time. It went on a lot of long car rides and plane trips with us. My son at age 6 dropped the player and then we had playing problems. I had a very difficult time getting service information. Finally I sent it to an indepentdent dealer who told me nothing could be done as Panasonic no longer makes the spare part and even if it did it would cost about 400 dollars. The service tech said they only make so many spare parts and when they run out that is it. I think this is shameful for such an expensive product. Buyer beware this product can't be dropped and should not be handled with small children.
2,la-95 portable dvd unit,"This is the second unit i bought this unit runs great but it breaks down within 2 years.My first unit the electric eye slide track stopped working, and wouldn't read any of my dvds to play.The secound unit the screen just went out and all power supply.I don't use it only on vacations, and baby it all the time, and don't let any kids touch it.I bought extra batterys, and attachments for this unit an spent hundreds of dollars.I think people should think hard before buying this unit.if your looking to spend alot of money, and get heart acks you found it."
3,"Good unit, but with a bug...","This a fine portable DVD player and it's worked well for me for a while, but Panasonic has thus far (many weeks) not responded to a serious bug that I've developed - after playing a Black & White DVD (an old Hitchcock movie), every movie plays Black & White on the unit's screen (it outputs Color fine to an external monitor/TV). If you stick with Color movies you're golden, but if you intersperse B&W, watch out!!"
3,Read on.,"Great form factor.Nice internal battery (located in the hinge on the screen)Great Sound.Extra battery option.I give it three stars because...You can see all the square pixels on the screen even 2 feet away. So instead on seeing detail of somebodies face, you see tiny squares. The cheaper initial didnt have this problem if i recall correctly.Also company should of included extra Vga out cable. Cost them a couple bucks and a spare is good to have."
2,"Great picture, terrible quality","Beautiful picture quality and great features - too bad I can't recommend it due to lousy reliability and worse service policies. The first laser failed about 14 months after I bought the unit. I replaced it for about $300, and that laser failed in 8 months. Panasonic doesn't seem to have many (if any) dealers or spare parts - so your only recourse is depot repair which is slow, expensive and unreliable.Love the picture but this thing is just too fragile and not worth the hassle - avoid."
3,Panasonic LA-95,Its great when workinging but at less than one year picture quite working. Still under warranty but involved to get corrected and approx $100.00 to fix under warranty. For an Expensive unit should have a longer life expectancy.
3,Early Skydiving,"This book looks at what I like to call the ""Bronze Age"" of skydiving, when the sport still relied a great deal on military-style chutes and novices who ""solo'd"" after a bout of ground instruction (no tandems or wind tunnels in those days!). Illustrated with black and white photos, this is an interesting look at just how far the sport has come in the last 50 years... a subject only briefly discussed in current skydiving books."
2,Portability,I bought this camera because of its size. It is a great camera to lug around. However the telephoto/wideangle button is clumsy at best. The one second hesitation on the playback mode is very distracting and annoying. I do not think the quality of the recording is as good as my old dcr-9.
3,Thought provoking,"I found this book to be very timely. It is a good foundational book on the history of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It went into thought provoking details of why the groups that operate in those theaters have been successful. The author inspired me to want to make a difference in the military. However, I feel it focused a great deal on the issues within the military and the solutions on how to deal with them, and although I agreed with some of the solutions, implimentation of them will have to come from the hightest levels in the military."
1,Materialism run amok,"The author attempts to explain changes in the geopolitical environment through evolution. This explanation is both materialistic in its view of human society and stands unproven by the author. While the author uses the term evolution with abandon, he never explains why evolution is the explanation. Furthermore, he never deals with the moral consequences of essentially accepting social Darwinism as true. The author sees something happening in geopolitics but he can't explain it effectively. Still better off reading Clausewitz."
3,Hammes has done better,"I was compelled to buy this book after hearing the author lecture at my school. He made excellent points and had great insight into future during that lecture, however the book that I purchased was somewhat lacking in many respects. The author does a good job at using historical examples, however many of these are somewhat undeveloped and it is hard to differentiate what he is saying of his own accord and what is actually based on historical fact. As the book gets more into the characteristics of Fourth Generation Warfare, the author also starts to get incessantly repetitive, making the same arguments over and over again. In the end, I found the book lacking in detail and energy, although most of the assertions put forth by the author were interesting and based on sound logic."
4,New Warfare,Great book on 4th Generation warfare and GWOT. It also mentions the elements of DIME (ILE students) Would recommend you give it a read. Highly recommend.
3,Important Book....But.....,"This book provides some valuable information and is an important contribution to understanding post-modern conflict, However.... Be prepared for a lot of redundancy. The first 4 chapters essentially set the historical stage/analysis. The remaining chapters, up to Chapter 13 provide some historical analysis and the meat of the theory does not actually begin until Chapter 14 and 15.Words of Caution... Some in the Academic arena do not agree with the theory of 4GW War, for Instance Dr. Echavarria of the War College does not feel that 4GW has been adequately articulated, substantiated or historically grounded.Additionally, besides the redundancy throughout the book, you may feel that the book was actually written for a High School Student. If you can overcome these little deficiencies, and look at what the author is conveying, the book has substantial merit.Terry Tucker, Doctrine Developer and Staff Mentor, Afghanistan National Army"
4,Great book on 4th generation warfare,"Colonel Hammes does an excellent job in describing 4th generation warfare. His explanation was clear and concise. This book is extremely readable. My one problem with the Colonel's book, however, is his description on how to defeat an enemy using 4th gen warfare. While a 360 performance appraisal, reform of an old supervisory system and a reduction in the officer ranks may help reform the military, it is not the direct actions needed to counter an active enemy. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars out of 5."
5,Difficult subject made accessible,"Instead of going into a long review like some of the others already submitted, this book took a very difficult subject (4G warfare), provided a brief history of warfare, and was able to show the evolution of warfare into the ""4th generation"".Without getting too political and second-guessing the decisions that have been made in recent engagements, this book provides you with an eye-opening thesis that helps explain the daily attacks and ""unconventional"" warfare that you see around the world on the nightly news."
3,Ad or Information,"Reads like a magazine ad for their products,although it is a step by step procedure using their products to creat one heck of a mask."
4,Nice quality product,"I only had two qualms with this product and neither of them are really bad things at all:1) I wish ALL of the pictures were color, especially in the painting section, but that would have probably made this book prohibitively expensive.2) I didn't realise you got this book free when you made a purchase from their website (one of their mask making kits). Still it was a great read and a nice price."
2,Wow... This is probably the most disapointing instructional book I've ever bought.,"Ok the book arrived today. I'm shocked at the price I paid and how little information it holds. It's not very long only 42 pages. Seriously I found way better information with step by step guides online. I was really hoping this would be detailed show different styles of mask making, other than how to make a basic mold, hell it doesn't even explain life casting... This really wasn't worth the money. It's like a promotional booklet to buy their (Monster Maker) products."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this item and the quality is so poor that I was mad I even spent my money on this! It is just like a cheap magazine with everything in black and white inside, and the information provided is so poor that is almos useless if you want to be serious about this. Do not spend your money in this material!"
3,Nothing you can't learn from the internet,"I thought this book would at least share a few creative ideas but it's all just basic step by step tutorials on sculpting, molding / casting latex, and how to paint on latex."
3,free instructional guide included,"I got this book from the monster makers website. I was surprised to see this book on amazon, seeing as how this was free with an order of their mask making kit.It was only about 200-300 dollars not the 695 the other review said. The kit really is great comes with all the materials needed to get started making masks, but that's why the other review stood out to me. The other reviewer complained about the author advertising his products in this book, but this is the free magazine that came with his product.So its basically the little instructional guide that came with a kit.The quality is just that, its a good reference when you have basic knowledge but your expectations are too high if you thought this was a stand alone instruction manual because its not."
5,A must for costume / mask makers,"A fantastic guide on the process of making a latex mask and sculpture reproduction in general, with a good section on airbrushing which I hadnt expected."
5,"Fast, Precise, Photo-Quality Printer","This is an amazingly precise printer, producing remarkably clear photos. Beisdes the great quality of its printing, the DeskJet 960cse is remarkably fast. With an output of 15 pages per minute, printing long documents is a pleasure."
1,Not up to HP standards,"I have owned many HP printers over the years and have been generally happy with their performance. However, the 960C is a different beast. I have tried two 960C HP printers and both are substandard. The first would not feed paper at all. The second folds, rips and otherwise damages paper every few print jobs. It cannot print envelopes at all without jamming. Although the print quality is good, I am returning this printer to the seller. The frustrations of clearing the paper feeder several times each day are not worth it! I advise against purchasing this particular printer."
4,Mac OS 10.1,"I use this printer with a G4 running OS 10.1. The printer runs slower than advertised due to the operating system, but the quality is fantastic. Pictures printed on photo paper are stunning. If you aren't interested in speed, I think it is a good, quality product."
3,good printer - HP slacks on ink and paper,"I replaced an HP 694... The 960cse does an admirable job but who the heck is HP fooling? Yes, they give you 1 color and 1 black ink cartridge... Unfortunately, the black is a ""starter"" cartridge (For those not familiar with the HP term ""starter"" it means half full!!!) which will get you back to the store to buy another in half the time - At the price of new ink, they should be giving a coupon for the other half of the ink they left out of the cartridge... And HP should loosen up with the paper quantity - You will get a ream of 6 sheets with your new printer (enough to be dazzled by the great print quality when testing out your new purchase but not enough to really do any serious printing)... I'm glad they included the cord (no USB cord just a power cord) and the driver CD... I like the product but HP doesn't make the PR grade for me..."
3,It's okay,"When you use thicker paper it always gets stuck, and the printer is very loud, you think there is a propblem when it prints becuase of how loud it is."
1,Bad! Broke first day...,"Well, this was pretty ugly. I bought this printer happily for a mere 200 dollars, and hoped it would work fine. I had owned an Hp720c before, and that served me well, untill it toppled off my stand and broke. I soon after bought the Deskjet 960c, setup was a little lengthy, although almost fully automated, everything was just fine. It printed two amazing prints on photo paper. I was overjoyed at the quality and outstanding speed. Next morning, I tried printing a 20 page text document, and it took some time for the printer to process the request, although I use a USB connection; following that, it printed the first 5 pages, ripped the next two, then jammed. I tried using different paper, everything. Still, no luck. I wouldn't buy it if I were you, go for something more reliable."
4,Very Good,"I just recently bought a new Dell Desktop Computer and bought a printer with it. I bought the Deskjet 960cse. It is very fast for this type of computer and prints very good pictures. I was suprised at how it performed because of the (low) price (...). I thought it would be just okay, but i was wrong. I would recommend this printer to anyone and everyone. It's also not that big and doesn't take up much room."
1,A poor investment,"We are now returning our SECOND HP 960c printer to Dell where we ordered it. The first 960c printer we received was defective and would not feed the paper. After the hassle of returning it, we received a second HP 960c printer. This one is defective as well. There is a serious problem with the paper feed. The printer damages and tears paper about every third print job. It has damaged every envelope we've tried to print. It's unacceptable.We've had HP printers for years and have never had this sort of problem. I would not recommend this printer to anyone."
2,So you only save $9 by buyiong the upgrade!!,"I purchased OneNote 2003 (in 2006) becuase I had no hope of a new version coming out (it had been 3 years after all)...So waht happens...In 2007, they FINALLY come out eith a new version...and to add insult to injury they only discount the upgrade by $9 over the Full version of OneNote.Do yourself a huge favor and spend a tad more and dont' buy this upgrade (and also, DON'T buy the full version)...Instead, but Office 2007 for Home and Student for about $120...Becuase you not only get a full version of OneNote 2007, you also get Word, Excel, and powerpoint 2007 as well. Microsoft (as usual) pulled a fast one and dropped Outlook 2007 from the Home Student version of Office, but they added OneNote instead...but don't worry, you can still use Outlook 2003 with it so you get the best of all worlds.Home And Student Version of Office give you a TON more bang for your buck..."
4,This book made the test look easy and I passed!,"I found the questions in this book harder than what was presented on the exam, the outcome, I found the 8 hour test less grueling and easy! This book definitely helped me pass the test and build confidence while getting a key insight to the harder types of problems in each topic. It is perfect for a student who has taken the classical courses in each subject and with a bit of a refresher will once again remember how to apply the engineering principals. Its not meant to reteach the entire subject and the math required to solve problems."
4,"Great book, comprehensive review","Got this book, used it in conjunction with the subject study guide from NCEES and a short review class offered by my university, and passed with no problems. This book it useful for the general exam portion of the test. I didn't take the overall general exam, so I don't know if it's enough detail for that, but it was definitely sufficient for just the morning half. Lots of good introductory material, easy to read, easy to mark up. I would recommend it."
1,Do Not Buy This Review Book,"I am preparing for the FE this semester and purchased this book from a club selling at school. This book has not been a single help in any way, shape or form. The review questions are horrible and do not accurately cover topics. The solutions to the problems do to explain in any detail how the solution was found. I have turned to using information and reviews given by other school's professors."
1,This is not a book,"This ""book"" is actually a 23-page pamphlet! There's some helpful advice, but, have I mentioned . . . It's 23 pages long!?"
5,Every man should read this book.,"Zubaty helped me understand how women shame men and how to recognize it and stop it in its tracks. This book dispels myths about male power, female moral superiority, women's intuition and equality. It is well-researched particularly regarding the biological differences between men and women. And how come women can be judges and senators, but do not have to register for the military draft? Zubaty goes to great lengths to show how women are materialistic, and men are naturally spiritually inclined. It's a true eye opener. Every guy should read it."
1,So you wanna be a loser?,"Hard to tell where to start...The correct way to play each hand without counting cards (called Basic Strategy) has now been known for over 40 years. Amazingly, this book dismisses these facts and recommends well over a dozen mistakes in their place. To put into perspective how bad this book is, John Patrick actually recommends splitting a pair of fives against a dealer's six.His book is replete with coupons and offers to play in different casinos in Atlantic City and Nevada. This fact alone, that fact being casinos are BEGGING you to come play at their tables and play blackjack the John Patrick way, should tell you everything you need to know about a John Patrick gambling system.There are many good books in the Amazon listing. This book is definitely among the very worst of the WORST of them, rivaled only by John Patrick's other gambling writings as to which one comes in last place."
5,Patrick knows What He's Doing,"Follow Patrick's advice if you're willing to accept small, consistent returns. If you want someone to tell you that once you win to keep playing and be greedy, go somewhere else. Yes, he admits his basic strategy is slightly different from the time worn model, but his is geared toward conservative players. He recommends socking it to the dealer when he is weak, and not doubling down against power cards. If you follow Mr. Patricks advice of the Big 4, you WILL win. Not every trip to the casino, but overall. To all the detractors that wrote bad reviews of the book: If his methods did not work, how has he stayed one of the most respected and well known professional gamblers?"
3,Learn Money management,"This book must be taken with a grain of salt. Patrick differs from basic stategy based on short term results. The majority disagree with this practice.The best thing about this book is its' money management system. Patrick teaches a conservative money management system that helps gain small but consistent profits.My sugesstion is get a different book if you want to learn basic strategy, but get this book for its' money management system."
4,"I don't agree with all of it, but its a classic","An enjoyable read and a classic, and fun for those who are interested in playing progressions. His classic 212 method and his advice on bankroll management, make this a must read, for the progression blackjack player. As with any method, play it at home extensively first before you take it to the casino."
3,Worth reading for a different perspective,"I am a fan of John Patrick's thoughts on gambling. However this book has me scratching my head more than any other he has written.On the one hand, I would definitely suggest reading a follow up book containing basic strategy. On the other hand, JP gives a somewhat compelling argument against putting more money on the table when the dealer has a strong up card. He also wants us to pile it on when the dealer is weak. Even if you can't remember basic strategy (buy a strategy card) just remembering these two ideas will help you out a lot.John's books cover how to play, and then the normal ideas about discipline, bankroll, money management, etc. All of this is good information. But his knowledge of the game in this book is the only book he has written where I deviate quite a bit from how he suggests I play the game."
1,****!!xx****,"Unadulterated rubbish, this is a collection of unworkable fallacies, gambling myths, erroneous advice, what Patrick knows about gambling could be written on the back of a postage stamp."
5,Wow this Good!,I just got this today and saw one episode and really liked it. Its Really good to. I found out about this from the trailor on one of my many anime dvds lol. This is rated 15+ due to nuidty cursing and some violence. Anyways you should get this. If you like sailor moon cardcaptor sakura then you'll love this. Im defently getting vol 1and3 to. Very addective.
5,There GREAT,"I purchased these speakers to try out, and they are great, I am going to replace the traditional speakers on the shelf and on the floor and mount these on the wall, out of sight out of mind.I am so pleased that I am going to order another pair!!!!"
3,Good Value,"The Audio Source LS 400 are a pretty good sounding speaker for the price. They are not Weather-Proof, they are weather resistant - so they need to be mounted under an eve or overhang. The brackets are ... plastic. If you are looking for a speaker to rock the neighborhood - these are not it. If you are looking for a low price decent sounding speaker - then these are a pretty good choice."
3,Customer support is horrible,"I bought these speakers and was very happy with the sound. However after a year one stopped working. I figured with a two year warranty, I would contact Audio Source for support. After numerous attempts to customer support, I never got a response back. The company apparenty sells these so cheap they can't hire anybody to help with repairs!!!"
4,Good Bathroom Speakers,"I read an earlier review that these speakers have to be protected from weather somewhat when used outdoors, so I thought they'd make fine speakers for the bathroom, and I was right."
2,Brackets No Good,"We like these speakers, had them mounted in our boat. The brackets are plastic, and not very sturdy. A little rough water and one of the brackets broke, leaving me to wonder how I am now going to mount the speaker...These would get a much higher review if (a) they came with metal brackets instead of plastic, and (b) if I could buy replacement brackets, which I have not been able to find."
4,Very nice for the price,Great speakers for the cost. The brackets are plastic but the sound is awesome. I have these out on the deck and they work great! You get what you pay for but these aren't your average $40 speakers.
5,Amazing quality and durability for the price.,"Amazing quality and durability for the price. I originally bought double the quantity because I assumed that each speaker must be sold seperately for this low cost.One of my runs is over 50 feet and the sound is only slightly softer than my 20 foot run, and the clarity is consistant.I have had these speakers for over 3 years with no problems."
3,Be Very Careful With These Speakers,"Ok, they ain't Bose or Altecs. They are a lower end speaker. They are built like a lower end speaker. These are not meant to get rained on and they don't do very well for a long throw. The big thing is that the bracket that comes with them is plastic! That's right, plastic!! The bracket will last a much shorter time than the speaker will. Don't bother with these unless you know in advance that they are lower end and don't expect the best performance. They also only come in white. Be aware of that too."
2,"Not waterproof - ""weather resistant""","Just make sure you know the difference. These speakers are NOT meant to get wet. They can handle being outside (ambient moisture, temp, wind, etc...) but aren't meant to be directly in the path of rain or snow.They are only really usable outside if you have large eaves/overhangs under which to place them.The only reason I didn't give this item 1 star is because I probably could have found all this out if I had read the Amazon advertisement enough... and at least they seemed well packaged before I shipped them back."
4,Imp. info,I can't rate/make comments on the quality since I haven't used it after purchase. If you are planning to connect with a PC/laptop then these are not the right speakers which you are looking for. You need to have an amplifier/deck to make them work. I purchased to connect with my notebook and enjoy surround sound. I was amazed to see that there were no connecting wires. Then I called helpdesk and they told me that u should have an amplifier which will cost around 30-40 bucks minimum. I had to return it back since there are other speakers available in market which can be directly connected from a PC and save your pocket. May be I should have carefully read the specifications.
3,Water resistant?,"Good sounding speakers given their size. Was a little disappointed with the fact that they are considered outdoor speakers but are not waterproof. You're expected to mount them under eves. Unfortunately, I wanted them mounted on the outside of a shed. Built a plexiglass cap to mount above the speaker to reduce the amount of rain it will be exposed to."
4,Very nice for the price,"I bought these speakers to bring music out on the patio. I installed them on the ceiling of our covered patio and hid the wires with some of those wire-hiding tubes from Home Depot.The speakers sound great. To be honest, I haven't turned them up very loud, because I don't want to bother the entire neighborhood. But I haven't noticed any problems with the sound.When I purchased them, I was surprised at how big they were, but once I had them installed they are very unobtrusive.They came with a bag of screws, but I ended up using my own, as the owns supplied aren't meant for screwing into walls."
2,Color,"Loved the size, texture and feel of the shawl. However, the color bled onto my beige jacket!! And, after washing it has not all come out!"
2,Look at the cholesterol,"I don't know why Amazon doesn't put the nutrition info on this thing online. Beware this thing has 27% (!!!) of the daily dose of cholesterol and 3% and 8% of fat and saturated fat respectively. Ditch this, get somthing like GNC Protein 95. It has the same amount of protein, without the fat and cholesterol."
3,"For the price, not surprised","If you're looking for some cheap stickers of classic cars, I can't fault anyone for buying these. Just don't expect the best printed stickers in the world. They're decent and while not vibrant in color, I'd say it was a good buy"
1,False Advertisement!,"Do not buy this item from Adorama Camera because what is being advertised is not what you get. The picture, the detail product review and the technical review all states that you will get three bands in three different color and when you get the product it is ONLY the black band and NOT the three bands as described. I am still in dispute with the company as I did not use the product so I cannot make a comment on the product itself but what is being advertised. I gave the product one star because I had to give it something so ignore that part of the review because I did not use it. One star is based upon not receiving what was advertised and the company not willing to produce what was advertised. If you want the three bands, then DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! This is false advertisement!"
3,Some of the pages are hard to read.,"This book is actually pretty long. I don't expect a lot of Beavis and Butthead fans to read it all the way through. Maybe that's the problem. You're not going to find any highbrow social commentary in these pages and the comedy seems less than what the show was. Maybe printed word just isn't the proper medium here. In any case, my biggest problem is the dark print and dark background on some of the pages. Makes the book hard to read at times."
3,Funny,"Dour books in one... It was a good deal, but consider it only if you're a hardcore fan... otherwise, it will suck!!!"
2,Instant Coffee Taste,I was really disappointed with the taste of these coffee pods. Being made by Folger I expected a decent cup of coffee. I tried both Regular and Decaf. They taste like instant coffee and a weak instant coffee at that. You have to use two pods even for a small cup to produce bearable coffee.
2,Average coffee,"This coffee tasted bland. I recommend Senseo's version because it works with also works with Home Cafe and has a stronger, earthier taste (5stars)."
3,Just like Folgers from a can,"I don't like Folgers from a can, but my husband does. He doesn't drink coffee as strong as I do. We got a bag of pods with our Home Cafe and I tried making a stronger batch by using two pods with less water. Didn't like it, but it does taste just like Folgers from a can for the non-single brewing machines. For him, it's not the best coffee, but it's fine for an everyday cup of coffee.If you like Folgers in general, you should like the pods. If you don't, these are not any better. Every brewer has different settings between the amount of water used with the pods, so you can adjust as desired (make it stronger, weaker) and the taste will stay the same."
4,"Great coffee, but needs a microwave","It's easy to use and makes a flavorful cup of coffee. It's only downfall is that I like my coffee HOT, not lukewarm. It is brewed hot-ish, but quickly goes cold. Drink fast, or do what I do and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds or so. Otherwise I'd have given it a five star rating."
2,Is more salt than seeds.,"Each ""seed"" is a like just a rock of salt, with a seed buried somewhere in the middle. OK if you want to eat a rock of salt but I could only eat a few of these per day. I only bought on here one other brand to compare & that was ""Good Sense"" brand - it was better because GoodSense brand tastes more like seeds we had baked at home around Halloween."
2,Way too salty,"I've been eating salted, roasted pumpkin seeds for over 50 years and this is one of the saltiest batches I've ever encountered. Unfortunately I bought 20 pounds and will be stuck with these for a long, long time. Unless you want almost all salt and practically no taste of the seed I don't recommend your purchasing these.Shipment was prompt and well packed."
1,Doesn't Drain,I received my sink quickly and I was extremely excited about its arrival. That smile turned upside down when I tried to test it out and it doesn't drain. The plastic hose that is connected to the bottom of the sink goes in your kitchen sink to drain but I tried lifting the hose in different ways to get the water out of the sink and it didnt work. I had to pick the whole thing up and dump the water out that way. Waste of time!
3,No directions!!!!!,The amazon.com experience was painless. Product came but no direction.Called customer service for the product and waited a day for voice mail that all but called me stupid or the person it was purchased for stupid that they could not figure it out. Offered to do a voice diretion with person. at that point decided to just forget it and did so. Product ok Customer service for product company not so great.
4,Good blues,"I'm new to Kirk Fletcher, but enjoyed the album. Good blues and solid guitar, though nothing extremely memorable. Fletcher struggles with the fate of not being a vocalist in a genre that usually depends on vocals. So the guest vocalist tends to set the tone, especially Kim Wilson who does a fine job."
1,Do not buy a Toshiba,"Like many others here, my Toshiba DVD unit just suddenly stopped working. It will not power up at all. and I just bought it 7 months ago. Very disapointing. I will not ever buy a Toshiba product again."
1,Junk,No Audio after very light usage. I got to Watch only 2 movies before the audio went bad. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.
1,NO AUDIO - SAVE YOUR MONEY,"When I decided to buy this unit last year (from Amazon.com) the reviews were few, and positive. Now I am having the same problem as all the other reviewers. After one year of very light use, the audio is gone. Don't waste your money on a Toshiba - they know about this problem and continue to sell this unit."
1,...,"This machine is[bad]. I have had it less than two years, and it has been serviced twice. The first time, 20 days past the warranty, the machine powered off and wouldn't power on again. The technician explained that these DVD players have had a lot of trouble with the ""power converter"". Now, two months after having the power problem fixed, there is no sound.STAY AWAY FROM TOSHIBA PRODUCTS!!!"
2,Toshiba 2710-worked for 70 days,"Was easy to set-up and use. I researched many manufacturers before I settled on the Toshiba, but it quit working after 70 days. Fortunately it is still under full warranty.Very disappointed."
2,Audio via external audio amplifier,"Yup, had the same audio faintness problem, just after the warranty ended. I ended up hooking it to an external audio amplifier and running it that way fine."
2,Got a great choice!,"The DVD player that I bought does not function properly. The colors fade in and out, bright and dark. It also pauses at least three times per movie. I would imagine that it is just a defective player, but I don't think I will buy another toshiba. Thank you very much...."
1,HUNK OF JUNK,Just days past the 1 year warranty the power supply died and took the whole system with it. I worked great until it committed suicide.
1,TOTAL CRAP - SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"We bought this in June of 2002 -- eleven months ago. VERY LIGHT USE considering we don't have many DVD's and only rent a few each month. In the middle of a new DVD I bought for my kids, the sound started to get low and scratchy. I tested another movie just to be sure and that also had very low sound. It is now at the point where our audio is turned to MAX and you can just barely hear it. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. Looks like I'll be out to find a non-Toshiba unit at a LOCAL store. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT BUY A TOSHIBA DVD!!!!"
1,Toshiba SD2710 DVD Player,"I purchased this DVD player in 2001, had very minor problem with setup and it has worked flawlessly for almost two years. The power supply circuit board went out; research showed me that there is a known design flaw with the circuit board. Toshiba customer service attitude was ""its out of warranty"" and became very rude when I described the design flaw to them. It is a piece of junk not worth the selling price -- or any price for that matter!"
2,picture trouble,i've had the unit for 9 months now and am now having trouble with the picture. it is as though the color adjustment on the tv is being slowly turned back and forth at a rate of once every minute or so. its something a person could (unwillingly) get used to but i'm going to look into warrantee and service options.
1,Don't buy,"The product is far under any UK standard DVD. Its slow,sound quality is just not there and there is far too many buttons on the remote!! Hard to hook up,manual useless!!"
1,Low Price = Low Value,"I bought the model SD-2710 through Amazon. After about 1 1/2 years of limited use (I also have a VHS player) the sound quit in the middle of a movie. Actually it was so low that you had to put your ear up to the speaker to hear. If one looks at the other reviews, one will find that I wasn't the only one with this same problem. With a limited 1 year warranty there was only two things left to do. 1. Throw the player out. 2. And remember not to buy another Toshiba."
2,Great...until it breaks!,"I bought this dvd player about 7 months ago, and at first it worked great and I was very happy with it. Then one night during the middle of a movie the sound went really low and I had to turn the volume on my tv way up to hear it. The sound will come back intermittently, which sucks because I am afraid it will blow out my speakers. Reading the other reviews here this seems to be the norm with this player. Now I have to buy a new player...I will NEVER buy another Toshiba."
1,What a Piece of Junk!,"...This unit died after a few months of very minimal use. DON'T BUY THIS UNIT!!! It will start out fine but later, the sound would disappear and the display would go along with it. Checked Toshiba's website to have it serviced but only got frustrated. Turns out that Toshiba would only cover the part as it was past the 90 day warranty..."
1,Piece of Garbage,This player worked fine for five months and then one day the power just wouldn't come on. Turns out this happens all the time with this model. Total garbage. Save your money.
2,"Good, but serious problems","I didn't have any issue with the DVD functionality, and I didn't test the MP3 options. But there were serious problems with it's CD-R compatibility. I had CD-R VCD's that would play fine for an hour or so, then the player would, for lack of a better word, get tired. It would start skipping or wouldn't be able to even get to a specific chapter. It would spin for a couple minutes not doing anything and then give up. If I turned it off for 30-40 minutes and then tried again it would play fine for another hour. Very frustrating when you are trying to watch a series. If you watch VCD's or CD-R's with MPG compression then I would recommend against buying this player, get a Sony, much better quality."
1,...Power Unit Defective on Two Separate Units,This product is a piece of [junk] and Amazon should not be selling it. I ordered one a couple of months ago. Within a day it had died. I (foolishly) had it replaced with a second one...This one lasted two weeks and then died. I find it...is clearly defective.
1,Stay Away - Unit Died - Not Even 4 Months Yet!,This Toshiba 2710 worked great for almost four months. Now the unit has died completely trapping my disc inside the machine. The 90 day warranty is over and I will most likely have to pay for labor after bringing it to a service center. What a piece of garbage. Never buy Toshiba again!
1,"Locks up after 1 hour, and this is not the first model","I am not sure what the problem is with Toshiba DVD players, but they seem to freeze or stall after about an hour into a movie. I have decided to go with a Sony so I can watch a complete video."
1,Audio went out,"I seem to be luckier then other people. My audio stopped working after I had the unit for 2 years and 4 months. At the time I purchased it, there were no reviews about this problem, otherwise I would have not purchased it. The audio problem seems to be a chronic problem."
2,BAD NEWS!,"This DVD player has worked great for three years. EXCEPT it is supposed to play CD-RW'S and DVD-R that are recorded and does NOT!! For this reason, I would not recommend this DVD player."
5,What a fantastic addition!,"I recently upgraded my D300s to a D700. Of course, that meant upgrading most lenses to utilize the FX sensor. One of those new lenses purchased was the 105 micro.I had the Nikon 85mm DX Micro, which was a great lens, especially when you consider the price. However, this is a marginally faster lens (2.8 v 3.5), but the clarity is superb.I have taken several photos with this lens and can say that it focuses fast, usually right on (I switch my camera to spot), and has a pleasant bokeh.It's not cheap, but if macro-photography is a passion, you can't go wrong with this in your camera bag."
5,A Painter's Lens,"This is a beautiful lens. I have used Nikon cameras and lenses for the past 40 years. To find a lens that does portrait and close up is wonderful. With it, the results are truly artistic. You feel more like a painter than a photographer because of the balance, colors and depth of field. Many people today judge a lens by sharpness alone. This lens will take you to a different level of photography."
4,"Nice Features, Fast lens","Very Sharp. Fast> I would have given it a five, but at close range the autofocus searchs alot. This is not that big of a problem because at Macro range I always manual focus. Nice lens for portrait and handheld close-ups with VR."
2,"Error in the optics, at least the one I had.","Frist I wanted to love this lens and I did for the first couple days. The problem was when I was out shooting macro in our backyard garden, I had a subject on the edge of the garden table and I was in close with the subject manually focusing on it then suddenly it disappeared from my view finder. To my surprise I was now looking at the pavers the patio is made with. The lens somehow shifted its point of focus 10-15 degree's down and to the left of my intended target. I a hobbyist photographer and don't know that much about the internal workings of camera lens, but I'm sure that a $1000 dollar lens shouldn't do that. So I shot some regular type photos all work perfectly, till I shot more macros. Same deal. So I sent the lens back and don't plan to get another one. Lastly, I have returned to my Nikon 28-85mm Macro lens that was made in 1985. I am sad.GregNikon D7000"
5,Two lenes in one,I found this lens to be both super fast in the auto focus range and versatile as a portrait lens and macro lens for closeup work for shooting fine jewelry.
5,Great Lens,"The Nikon 105mm f/2.8g ED-IF AF-S is a beautiful, sharp lens.It was worth waiting for as my primary glass."
4,The Nikon 105mm Micro-Nikkor,"The lens performs as advertised. When used within the suggested parameters the results are great. Not the silver bullet for every situation, but excellent for what it was designed for. The user must become proficient on how to take into account all the attributes of an excellent image. The lens cannot compensate if the lighting,focus, etc. are not optimum. The lens reproduces what it ""sees""; no more no less."
4,Nice lens,I am new to macro photography. Depth of fields is critical so a tripod helps. Great lens/tool. But it takes some learning to prefect the art of macro photography
2,Not worth the money!!,"A good lens, but save your dollars and buy the older model, or the Tamron 90 macro. VR does not work up close, and that's the selling point of this lens. If you have to go manual for a macro shot, any of the other macros will suffice. I recently sold mine on ebay as I found that my Tamron 90 macro was just as sharp!! At half the price!!! Also, the 18-200 Nikon offers very good basic macro, and is much more of an all around lens!!"
2,"Bad ergonomics, drastic focus hunting","Sure, this lens is ultra sharp, but there is more to a lens than sharpness. IMHO, this lens is an ergonomic nightmare: it is simply way too heavy and fat for a 105mm telephoto. Plus the big bayonet hood makes it look and handle like a 300mm or similar long telephoto.Besides bulk of this lens, I had trouble with focus hunting where it would occasionally rack 2-3 times from infinity to the close limit before finding the focus point. This is unacceptable for a lens at this price point.I returned it because I dreaded carrying this 1.5 lb brick. I really wanted to like it. The images were great, when it focused."
3,Macro 105mm f2.8,I just bought this lens from J&R; through Amazon last week. I was supprised that this expensive lens made in China!I was so disappointed. I took a test drive any way. The result as I expected.I could not get apeture open up to 2.8. It has a ranking noise when it tried to open it. Second issue is focusing. The auto focusing sensor seems like it not working properly. It went back and forth many times in order for the AF sensor to detect.Image quality is great but the workmanship is terrible. Made In China!!! what can I say? I have owned two lens made from ThaiLand but it won't last me 3 years. My others made in Japan and I bought it in 1995 and still working great. This lens is on the way back to J&R.;I recomand to look for the lens that made in Japan.
3,Warning to perspective buyers,"Depending on how you intend to use this lens you should be aware that it is a variable depth of field lens. I purchased it primarily for portraits, and secondly for the 1:1 focusing. As a macro it seems nice but as a portrait lens it's pretty frustrating. I took it out tonight shooting as the sun was setting. I like to shoot wide open but with this lens when you change your subject distance, wide open changes from 2.8 to 4. Infuriating if you're using strobes!I cant decide if i should keep it. It seems like a solid lens otherwise but i've only owned it a few days and so far it's been more than a little frustrating."
4,A different take on young love,"This book is a love story that made me recall Eric Segal's best-selling ""Love Story"" in the seventies. A young couple meet, fall for each other, overcome adversities ... well, it's best left to the next reader to accompany them on their journey.It's a refreshing change from today's Chicklit - no heaving bosoms, no chisel-faced protagonist who has a vision and never wavers. Instead, it's about two very real young people who muddle along as they try to figure out who they are, what they want and whether they can make it work. They're just like people you know.Their life unfolds against a backdrop of war, espionage, and adjusting to life in a foreign country. My suspicion, even though this book states it is fiction, is that it is more biographical than fiction. Some of the settings are simply too realistic to just stem from the imagination. Regardless whether it's truth or fiction, the story is fast-moving and will hold your interest to the very last page."
4,Green. Knights are a hit with three year old!,"These knights, along with other figures and the castle have become a major favorite of out three year old grandson."
4,Classic,"You have to get used to the fact that Sanskrit has its own alphabetic order, and yes its own alphabet. Fortunately all words have Latin spelling too, leaving the less fortunate of us who do not know the language but struggle to find the right reference to struggle with the ""vowels first - consonants later"" Sanskrit alphabetic order. The more you use it the easier it gets. Very valuable Indo-European cognates (especially Greek and Latin) can be found throughout."
2,eh,the first part of the video is whats worth watching just to see 70 plus year old cars running otherwise the naration will put you to sleep and horrible backround music when it would be better to hear the cars
5,Suds,Great product. Great smell. Good grease cutter. Sometimes even these fancy fragrances end up smelling disinfection-y. This smells clean and not like a cleaning closet!!
4,Rockport Women's Cardiff Ankle Strp Sandal,"Rockport shoe is a favorite of mine. A very comfortable shoe. Only one complaint, that is the velcrow strap at the heel catches on to my socks or stockings. A better way would be just the leather strap with some elasticity to it. Still a favorite brand of mine."
4,love my new rockports,"I wanted a comfortable sandle that I could wear with a skirt or pants, and I could be pretty confident would last forever. I think I've got it."
4,Good Stuff,"Efficient shipping, and got here in decent timing. The quality of the product fall nothing short of my expectations."
3,Flat and natural responce,"I purchased this set to replace a pair of KLH's 905b and that was being used as my main front speakers to my DTS system. I found the AudioSource to be very flat and more natural than the KLH's in the voice range. I plan to move the KLH's back to the front and use the AudioSource for the rear speakers. I found the AudioSource a bit to flat for my use. I like the sparkle on the highs that the KLH's gave, sinch the center speaker carries the main vocials. Other than the flat or natural or a better term dull sound and I am not sure I would use the AudioSource outsied, sinch the case is ported the weather could enter the speaker, unless used under an overhange."
1,terrible,"bought a pair of these speakers to use in my backyard, one of the woofers stopped working, so the seller sent me a replacement. The replacement's woofer was lose and the low end sounded awful. Got another replacement. A couple days after receiving the replacement, both speakers broke using a 75 watt receiver turned up less than half way"
5,A Must Read For ANYBODY!,"""Confusion is a State of Grace"" Gives witty and off the wall quotes to combat whomever you are. You don't have to be an addict or know one to enjoy this book. Whether or not you've had a good or bad day...you can always relate to the quotes..."
5,Fascinating view of mathematics,"This is an excellent survey of mathematics, its culture and practice. The text is non-technical and eminently readable. The topics are broken down into shorter pieces for easy digestion, and are meant to appeal to readers who think of mathematics as a stodgy field and who never quite understood the allure it holds for its practitioners. Never a dull moment."
5,Got me into maths,"I first read this book 14 years ago when I was 14. It made me want to be a mathematician, even then and I ended up doing maths at university. So I can genuinely say this book did change my life, as I was going to be an England cricketer prior to reading it!"
4,Entertaining And Fun!,This was about 4 hours of entertainment for around $15! I can't see why people complain or say that it's expensive. The episodes were well done and had some of the best action I've seen for a TV production. Really great jumping and kicking. Good special effects too. I would recommend this for someone that wants something fun to watch late at night or on the weekend.
3,Accories for Lionel,I use these on my SuperStreets Trolley Layout - The add some realism to it. They are nice model accessories.
1,Liars!,"The only reason I purchased this item was because the features list clearly states that it has ""Automatic hands-free operation..."" but when the product arrives, it clearly states that you must hold down on the lid while it vacuumes and seals. Be warned this is not what they claim it is! This unit is designed to vacuume cheese and wine bottles! And you'll find no mention of that in the features list either!"
1,Roman empire did not end: please another historical rewrite?,"I don't want to bother buying this video since the reviewers tell us that it describes the fall of Old Rome, but says nothing about continuation of the empire in ""New Rome"" (later called ""Constantinople"") in 313 ad - a century before? What is this revisionist point exceptthat no historian in the west wants students to realize that Rome lived on - in the Eastern capitol with a flourishing culture and Faith - for another 800 years until the Crusaders sacked it in 1204!! See ""Fall of an Empire: Lesson of Byzantium""by historian Archimandrite Tikhon who has an excellent documentary with this title on youtube.com. Strongly advise this as an historian myself!"
2,"Fighting and more Fighting and loud, irritating commentary","I actually rate this documentary 2.5 stars..not two stars...as it does have SOME value with the information narrated to you and some of the scenes are educational.I tried to like this series..as i wanted to like it...however it is just your typical History Channel ""in your face"" style of narration and layout with loud, very irritating sounding ""Experts"" telling you the history. It is ashame..because this could have been very good documentary...but whoever designed the layout and the commentating history ""experts"" ruined it. One historian.. (I think he was a professor) just sounded nearly retarded with his way over done, very loud, ""southern US accent"" ..and he seemed to be the main commentator throughout the entire series.There is just fight scene after fight scene..and they all look similar..after 100 times of it...you just want to turn it off...as the narrator has already irritated you beyond the point of survival anyways."
3,Rome,"I was disappointed because the cover lead me to believe it was part of a HBO series that is amazing drama. This cover used the same layout and letter style of the others title. It was not,by HBO and I could have just read the book for the history."
2,mediocre at best,"I was expecting a much more thorough history of Rome. This series just skips from one catchy happening in Roman history to another, leaving out huge interesting chunks in between. It lacks details, for instance ""when Caesar sailed to Greece he was greatly out numbered"". That's it... How many legions did he have? Even the HBO Rome series includes that tidbit of information. Seriously you're being outdone by fiction. The battle at Alesia there wasn't even a map to visually portray the fortifications. Just mediocre reenactments of about 20 Romans fighting a dozen or so Gauls on a plain... I thought there were fortifications???"
2,bad disk rate of 20%,I purchased a 50 pack of dvd-r and 10 of them were bad - could not record on them by either of the dvd recorsing applications that i use.
1,Worst quality,"I had a bad start with these DVDs. 16 DVD out of 16 were bad. I don't know what will happen to rest 34 of them. I don't even want to give 1 star, but there is no option for BLACK star."
3,It is Moser Baer MBIPG101R04 8X +R,"The quality is about the same as CMC Mag R03 8X +R, not worth 60 cents a piece."
4,dress me up cute,"The product is great quality, and I had to return for smaller size and the companys turn around was wonderful, would use this product again in a heartbeat!"
4,A Great Book About A Great Gymnast,"Kim Zmeskal: Determination to Win is a fantastic book about a fantastic gymnast. After reading this book, I feel like I have known Kim forever. You learn about many of Kim's meets, how she did, and other details. You also learn about her life as a gymnast. Every gymnastics fan should read this book, Kim Zmeskal: Determination to Win"
3,A Long and Comprehensive Read,"Jules Witcover's _Party of the People_ traces the Democratic Party from its Jeffersonian roots, through the tumultuous Civil War period and into the modern party dominated by the four terms of Franklin Roosevelt. Witcover's well-researched tome, the companion to _Grand Old Party_, the Republican history volume, sheds light on the previously forgotten likes of Benjamin Harrison, James K. Polk, John Tyler and the notorious James Buchanan in short, 20-page chapters that take history one term at a time.The 730+ page length of this book makes it forbidding for some casual readers, and in some parts the text is dry and overly academic, but the vasty majority of Witcover's work in _Party of the People_ is a commendable history of America's oldest political party."
3,A Decent Book on the Democrats,"I liked the book, but I found it very curious that Random House had to let a partisan liberal Democrat write the book on the Democrats, while allowing another partisan liberal Democrat write the book on the Republicans. (Further evidence of liberal bias in the publishing industry.)It is interesting as well that the critical analysis ends with the middle of the twentieth century. From roughly 1930 on Party of the People is basically a puff-piece."
1,Very disappointing,"This is a product that could be great. I had both the 4.0 and 7.0 versions of Printmaster and was very satisfied with both. Got the 8.0 Platinum and among other things, the Typical install doesn't even work. Bad sign right from the start. CD's were shipped mislabeled and don't work right, etc. Tech support has no 800 number and e-mail tech support still hasn't responded to my requests for help. A patch could clear many problems up, but since Mindscape and Broderbund became one company, I don't know when that'll be. I liked it better when it was just Mindscape...I've re-installed 7.0 on my machine until the patch comes out, if one comes out. Good luck if you buy this thing."
1,BAD,I've got plenty of these batteries lying around at home - all of them used up! Why??? ---> THEY DON'T COME AS RECHARGABLES!!!! If they were made available RECHARGABLE then I would rate them 5 star but until then ... they will remain 1 star (or worse). They finish very quickly!
4,4 1/2: Excellent Introduction!,"Dr. Stephen Astor is a Californian allergist who has taught at both Stanford University and the University of California. This is a clear and informative book about the nature and treament of allergies (as well as allergen-related asthma). Though brief (201 pages with Appendices on medications and on other allergy books), it covers the basic treatments and lets the potential patient know that options are available: ""By understanding both sides of the different claims made about allergy treatment, you can determine for yourself whether a new finding, drug, machine, or injection is new for you.""Astor's presentation of study results is always clear, and he makes a potentially tedious topic interesting by debunking common allergy myths, and summarizing major points through ""hints."" I hope that there will be a new edition (this third edition was published in 1992) when there is sufficient new information on allergies and their treatment."
2,An honest review,"I'm a Mercy Me fan because the guys in the band are very talented and focused on Jesus. I have all of their cds and my dissappointment is that this dual disc has nothing much to offer. I thought the dvd side would have live concert performances of all the songs. It does not! It has just the live concert performances for ""Homesick"" and ""Here With Me"" and some bonus footage and commentary etc which are not really worth it considering the $14.98 store price I paid for it and also that I already had the Undone audio cd.I regret my purchase. If you do not have the Undone cd, this is a great buy but if you already do (like me), it's actually a waste of good money except you are a real die hard fan with cash to flash"
4,Sandi is the best.,"I own just about everything Sandi has recorded, this project although not one of my favorites still has some very moving songs and as always Sandi delivers every time on the vocals and then some."
1,"Renders SD cards unusable, STAY AWAY!","This has a known issue with ruining SD cards, and the manufacturer doesn't respond to support requests. It trashed a bunch of my photos. The cards worked fine with an Imation FlashGo! Stay AWAY!!"
5,"Reliable, affordable edition",This edition of Liszt Etudes is terrific. I loved that it was under $20. It came highly recommended by my teacher.
1,Broken twice!,"We received these cups (which are very nice heavy metal), and the handle was detached from the largest size. We ordered replacements and the second set also had the handle detached. Apparently the method of attaching the handles is inadequate for the job."
2,not squirrel proof,"This feeder had no instructions. I thought the lid was locked tight, but a squirrel or large bird was able to tip it and empty the seed. It's very cute, but if you have a lot of birds you have a large traffic jam. I had a downy woodpecker fly into our window in the melee of birds trying to get to the feeder."
5,Best accessory for Archos!,"I have been impressed with the quality of this camera, especially outdoors. I bought it thinking that it would be a fun little toy add-on for the Archos but I have found myself many times bringing it along as my primary recording device because it is so much easier to bring with me rather than a bulky camcorder."
3,The Workbook,Does anyone have any idea where on the website I can purchase the matching workbook? I'm currentley enrolled in a college course that uses this book as a refresher for my upcoming high school year and I would like to stay on top of my math with extra help from the workbook. I can't find it anywhere on Amazon! Anyone have any idea?
2,"looked good, but had to return","These shoes looked great online but once I got them they lacked any support what so ever. Unfortunately, I had to return them."
1,Poor quality,"I have ordered SW tights for my daughter and have been very happy with them. I thought the adult size would have a similar smooth, ribbed quality. But, they are thin, not opaque and look as if they have a mottled texture throughout. Very disappointed, especially considering how expensive they are."
3,Run Small & Are Itchy!,"I'm 5'4"" and 118lbs, ordered the M expecting a comfortable, easy fit, but I'm only just able to fit properly into them and doubt I'd fit into them if I were any taller or weighed more. Although heavy duty they are itchy and by the end of the day I can't wait to get them off..."
4,Just what I was looking for,"I was concerned when I ordered these tights that they wouldn't fit, based on other reviews, and because I am a larger size (5'8"", size 16-18) - I ordered the largest size of course. I tried them on immediately after receipt and was pleasantly surprised that they fit - a little snug, but perfect for my under clothing base layer needs. My calves are muscular and lower body plump, but they pull all the way up and fit to my waist. Just what I needed!"
1,Wool Tights,These tights are made for VERY skinny women--I am NOT fat--125 lbs. at 5ft.2 1/2 in. I could not get the med. size tights on--Healthy weight people get cold too!
5,Perfect for Northern Winters,"I thought these were pretty pricey but decided to order them anyway. Once I took them out and tried them on I was SOLD - what a WONDERFUL solution to cold legs! I'm 5'8"" 130 pounds - the medium were plenty large enough with room to spare at the top, no bagging, no sagging, not tight around the waist. These are not itchy! They are warm - like wearing long johns - and soft.I have always loved SmartWool socks - that's why I was willing to try these. Well, SmartWool did not let me down. Great product, worth the money.I am going to buy another pair."
2,Sizing off.,"I was so disappointed by the size of these. I purchased a large which, according to the description was for women 5'6""-5'10"" and 140 - 170lbs. I'm 5'9"" / 160lbs and was shocked that the crotch for these tights only came to mid-thigh. I love smartwool products and am desperately looking for a replacement for winter."
4,Compilation album!,"Nice, consistant & well put-together compilation of a track or two from this St. Petersburg group's early albums - Duplo (the title in English is a bit rawer), Sky Down the Middle, Mountaintop Dweller, Ptiza (Little Bird), How I Became a Traitor, Hangover, Return to Sorrento, Teapot of Wine, All Quiet in Baghdad, and This is Mom. My choices would have been different, but this compilation (if you already have the albums there's nothing new here) gives an accurate presentation of the group's sound."
2,Wrong size,"I ordered a L-XL. Received a M-L. Hat does not fit. To tight. But instead of the agravation of sending it back, I will keep it. Maybe my wife can wear it."
1,A weak voice,"I served in the same unit as the author at about the same time and find his recollections to be widely off the mark. Readers will get a distorted view of the 101st Airborne Division from this book.It seems as if the author had tried to avoid military service and had a bad experience when he finally got into uniform. He should be grateful that he was selected for a job in the rear rather than being assigned to the engineer battalion, where he would have faced real danger. I lost several friends who were in the 101st at the same time. This book is an insult to their memory."
2,Discontinuity,"As it rather often happens, Roth alternate in this book wonderful pages (the funeral of the dog) with passages much less substantiated in quality and ideas. Besides, the book reveals the traditional american superficiality as far as communism is concerned."
3,Well-written story,"I love Phillip Roth, and this book was another fine work from him. It was a well-written and sensitive portrayal of a man's life before during and after the McCarthy era of outing communists. The character of Ira Ringold is one of my favorite literary characters. All of the others are also strong characters, many you will identify with, or recognize as people in your own life. I enjoyed it alot."
2,No likeable characters and...,"Up until reading this book, the only work of Philip Roth's I had ever read was Goodbye Columbus, when I was in college. I remember liking it very much. That was thirty years ago. Roth appears to have gone downhill severely, if this book is an example of his current writing. I Married a Communist has no characters who are even remotely likeable. The distanced ""narrator"", Murray, keeps us at bay with his windy language and constant digressions. Very self-indulgent choices by the author. Everything is asserted, nothing is shown. Enormously disappointing. I am only giving two stars because I actually managed to finish it, and the ending is good."
1,Get over Roth,Just because Roth wrote Portnoy's Complaint doesn't mean everything he writes is gold. The prose is tired and stale and the ideas expressed are as inflated as Roth's ego. I Married A Communist is a book for old men to read so that they can go to the country club and appear well-read. Please let's get over Roth and move on to writers who don't let their self-appreciating attitude reflect in thier work.
4,Another Great Roth Novel!,"I really enjoyed this book - never mind the obvious structural parallels to ""American Pastoral"" - it is well crafted, entertaining, and a very good read. The main character's compelling story carries the book, but it is your identification with his young protege, Nathan Zucherman, that gives the real sense of humanity to the novel. Definitely worth a read if you enjoy Roth's writing."
2,TEDIOUS,"I found this book very tedious, especially when he went on for two or three pages describing the main female character without telling us anything really new about her.I couldn't finish it."
1,A BIG letdown.,"A devastatingly boring book. I had to force myself to finish it. It gains momentum only in the last 30 pages. The way the story is told, from Ira's brother to Ira's former protegee as a memory decades gone, serves to remove the reader from the story before ever drawing them in to begin. I couldn't believe it was Roth's work!"
1,Boring and non-stimulating,"I did not like this book. It was very hard to get though, and extremely slow at times."
4,"Passion, betrayal, and the blacklist","The life of Ira Ringold, a Communist activist-cum-radio star who was betrayed to the blacklist by his actress wife, is reflected upon by the last two people alive who knew him--his brother Murray, a former English teacher, and Nathan Zuckerman, who grew up idealizing him. The result is a complex and fascinating novel about the nature of human passion, betrayal, and much more.Ira emerges as a tremendously angry and violent figure who latches on to Communism as a means of civilizing himself. Young Nathan is initially swept along by the purity of Ira's fervor, but ultimately gains perspective as he matures and broadens intellectually while Ira remains mired in a pure belief in Communist doctrine that blinds him to all its faults. Murray tries to act as the voice of reason to shield Ira from his own impulsivity and rage. All of this goes on against the backdrop of the Hollywood blacklist and the vicious social mercenaries of the elite. Recommended."
4,A fine novel.,"Roth here is at the top of his game in terms of prose style and skill at characterization. Ira, Murray and Eve all are memorible characters. The left-wing politics of the era are brilliantly realized. Better still, politics does not dominate the novel; rather, it is used to strenghen and perspectivize the characters. Uncharacteristically for a Roth novel, the ending is well done (Roth is notorious in his inability to end well even his best work); it is perhaps one of the finest passages in Roth's oeuvre. While I don't think I Married A Communist will stand as one of Roth's most accomplished novels, it is a great read. I recommend it."
4,easy to double up,"These are the only sunglasses I wear. They slip on easily and they have worked well with the glasses I have (they probably would not work well if you have small frames, though). I like them because I have very sensitive eyes and I can double them--one large and one medium--and actually see without squinting. I also like that they curve and provide some protection at the sides. You do need to be careful with them because they scratch easily, but at this price, I'll live with that."
1,Disgusted,"First of all they did not fit my glasses at all. I tried everything I could to fit them inside and out. They are cumbersome. These glasses cost me over $2, they are not even worth 1c."
3,Jeep Steering Damper,"The damper functions well. The fasteners, however, were incorrect for my application and I had to reuse the original ones. Unfortunately, you can't determine this until you have removed the other one."
2,Papa Review,The best thing I liked about this movie was the lead actress's clothes and the cute children. The storyline just did not do it for me. I was disappointed. Sorry.
5,Very good software,"I have a full review below. Just wanted to add something else.Home Studio XL in Windows 2000 gives annoying little problems that force you to stop your flow (in some cases for as long as 5 minutes when it crashes and you let windows 2000 sort everything out on its own). Every problem in the full review pertains to working in windows 2000.However, on windows 98, its smooth sailing. I never had a problem with it while working in Windows 98."
2,story of anoraks and their bikes,"Must say as a big fan of Classic Bike that I was very disappointed in this DVD on the bonneville. I expected a good overview of the development of the bonneville, some in depth footage on the mechanicals, and something about how models changed, something about maintenance and ownership and test ride footage.Instead I got a bunch of middle aged blokes talking about what Bonnies meant to them and how cool it was to now own one. I have no idea what the second half of the DVD included, because I had dropped off before it got that far.So if you want pretty pictures of a couple of bikes, and some old rockers talking about being nostalgic, this is your DVD.If you want something to send you off to sleep after a hard day with a bit of Brit wallpaper, then this is highly recommended.If you want a DVD about the love of british iron, buy BritTown, THAT is an excellent movie.For the money and effort I feel the guys at Classic Bike could have done the subject a lot more justice."
4,Nice solid overview,"DVD provides a nice general overview of the Bonnie, great for anyone interested in the Bonnie history from the 60's up through the modern day versions."
5,This is it.,"This book is riveting, captivating, and extremely well researched, I was lucky enough to be able to find a copy of this HARD to come by book, so copies of it are quite scarce unfortunately, this book and UNDER THE SIGN OF SCORPION which can be bought from Texe Marrs (Power Of Prophecy) will indoctrinate you on what history , and academia has been lying about, and hiding for a long time. after reading this book, your whole outlook on things will be a heck of a lot different. excellent read. Highly recommended."
5,If you're serious about Banned Books Week,"In the West there is an effective blackout on this thoughtful - if somewhat arch - study. The author, writing in 1956, predicted as much. If you're looking for thuggish bigotry, you'd be better off looking elsewhere. And if the Clarion Fund's mass-distributed ""Obsession"" DVD happened to land in your newspaper or mailbox, you needn't look far. Of course that particular example concerns a different situation, a different people/religion who we're expected to hate on cue. In any case, one of the book's great strengths is that Reed, a journalist, was on the ground during many of the 20th c. events described and analyzed therein. As history, is it true? Is it reliable? I can only say that its arguments are apparently not quite laughable enough to merit pubic discussion by its critics. It is, rather, a document to be shunned - forgotten utterly - according to the dictates of these self-appointed Information Priests."
3,My cat gets bored easily,"The DVD occupies my cat while I'm gone. I don't know how much of it he waatches, but he loves the butterflys."
2,it didnt work,"I ordered this DVD hoping it would occupy my cats attention. Sadly, my cats expressed no interest in it before spending a moment or two sniffing the dvd case.I gave this product two stars as I enjoy listening to it while reading."
3,Should have let the cat choose,The video is very well done from a human perspective. I found it entertaining to watch and hoped the cat would too. Not so. He was more interested in seeing if any food was in my hand than interact with the TV. I tried it twice and still no interest. I'm returning it and will break out the paper bag which he find much more entertaining!
3,Nice but a little weird,"The dvd served its purpose;however, I'm confused as to why there is writing coming across the screen. As though my cat can read it? And the weird man voice that tells a story, is a little creepy when you're not expecting a random man to start talking. Other than that, it held their interests."
5,Got as A Gift,"Got this as a gift and had some reservations at first (but it was fun to open) as only 1 of my cats watches TV. But you know what, they both seem to really like it. Now they run to the TV when they see me start to load it into the DVD player. LOL"
2,cat video,"This video is too slow...our cat loved the butterflies, and other cats, but during those long (boring) walks through the grass, our cat lost interest. She enjoys the animal channel on TV more. Would not reccommed this video"
3,Interesting Video,Bought it because I heard that the cat would watch it. My cat watched for 5 minutes - lost interest. Have tried a couple times - listens to the meows for a few seconds - seems to have learned they are not real - and walks out of the room. Of course all cats are different.
1,Bored Cat Walked Away,"Unlike the DVD I reviewed yesterday, this one is pathetic.The cat didn't come to the TV when it started - my husband had to carry the cat over and show her the bird on the screen.There is lousy sound (mic noise), sound doesn't match what's on the screen (our cat kept looking away, trying to see where the interesting stuff was), and a whole lot of time is spent either walking around (jerky camera work), or watching ducks in the water.Ducks. In water. My cat was not amused.Background noise included kids yelling (freaked the cat a bit), and occasional voice overs of people talking about their pets - including dog owners talking about their dogs. Um, isn't this a cat video? Yeah, that's what I thought.After the chicken segment, our cat just laid down, and looked away."
1,ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY,THE VIDEO IS AMATEURISH AT BEST. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE CATS DON'T CARE ABOUT MUSIC!FORGET ABOUT THIS DVD.
4,Meow meow meow,"Meow meow meow meow meow, meow meow! Meow meow meow, purrrrr meow. Meow meow meow; meow meow meow purrrr. Meow meow? Meow!"
2,Bad luck with my cats,"I have my own cat and I was also fostering a momma cat and her three kittens when this video was played. It was my bad luck, but none were interested. I was so disappointed that I am not sure if I'll ever try any other cat videos. sounds like a good idea at first, though."
2,Not the best,"We got this video for our younger cat who loves to watch the t.v., especially the nature programs. While it does have some things on it that cats like (birds, ducks, butterflies, fish) there is something that many cats do not like and that is another cat on their territory. Our cats were watching happily until suddenly a large cat appeared on the screen. That sent our younger cat racing out of the room, breaking a couple of ornaments on the way. Needless to say, none of us were pleased at this outcome. It has taken nearly a week to get him to come back into the room when the t.v. is on. Anyone who knows anything about cats knows that they do not like strange cats...especially when they show up suddenly in their living room! This video was a total disaster and we would not recommend it."
1,cat dvd...,"No interest for cats...winding paths boring; tried various methods of presentation, but no luck. Boring cat-wise relative to others available."
2,Not For Jiggles...,"This dvd has realistic sounds to match the images. The animals vary and the scenes are always changing to provide variety. When I first placed the dvd in, my cat was seated and ready but she lost interest nearly straight away. I thought it was just the opening so I fast forwarded to the other animals. The ducks kept her interest for a short while. The dvd doesn't allow you to skip or chose the animals your cat may prefer. My cat loves 'The Purrfect Cat DVD'."
3,Served its purpose,"Two of my three cats liked this video, i.e. they watched a lot of it. However, they have their preferences and prefer mostly birds. They could have done without the cat and the fish sequences. It all depends on your cats preference. But it does entertain on a gloomy winter day."
3,Maybe it's just my cats.................,My cats don't like this video as much as the PetSitter cat videos. They watch it for very short periods and get bored with it.
2,my 2-year old Male Tabby not too interested,"I think it's because the action is too slow. He's attracted when the screen fills with a big duck for instance but most of the action is too buried in the overall image frame - not enough points of interest doing something that engages him. If nothing else he's intrigued by some of the animal sounds. For humans the music bor-ing! Definitely not a top-rate video, I'll probably try another."
3,cat's pleasures,"Benny can sit through it time and again. He may be able to, but my brain has some(a few limitations, anyway), and so am more limited. But he loves it, and what else matters?"
3,Kitty movie,"It seems I enjoyed the dvd better than my cats. They were not very interested, they lost interest very fast and started playing with their furry mice"
4,Serenity,"My cats liked the birds in the video, but could have had more action. They weren't at all interested in the walk through the woods. Too much time spent on the fuzzy thing on the string. I would have included more action, like mother bird feeding babies, squirrels eating nuts or playing, maybe dogs rounding up cattle... just more creativeness. Maybe this would be good for older cats. Nice music and serene."
2,my cat did not care about this DVD,"I have a senior cat who I thought might enjoy this DVD, the first time I played it I went to take a shower to see if my cat would take to it.. she did not care about the DVD at all. The background noises were probably nice for her, she didn't complain, but the visual aspects of the DVD fall flat. I gave this 2 stars because I think a younger cat may enjoy it more."
2,made by a crazy cat lady,"This dvd wasnt very good, it barely caught my two very active and TV aware cats attention. There was footage on it that a person might find interesting but a cat?Kid sounds, etc walking along a path, It needed more movement , that is what seems to get and hold the kitties attention . I don't recommend this one : ( we were allvery dissapointed."
3,OK Sound,"After reading the other reviews on these, I guess I was expecting them to sound really good. I would say that their sound is just OK, no better than that for sure. Absolutely no bass, and vocals sound very tinny and hollow. Then I remembered how much I paid for them, and I figured 'what can you expect'. So, don't be misled by the other reviews, the bottom line is that you get what you pay for, and these sound like [an inexpensive] pair of speakers. They represent a decent value in low end speakers, but nothing more."
4,Under 30 BUCKS,How can you complain for under 30 bucks .. Great for outdoor use. NO they are not Klipsch but they are 30 BUCKS. I would recommend they for anyone wanting an inexpensive speaker.
3,"Season 5, Part 1","This set includes 4 disks with 2 shows per disk + 1, total of 7 episodes. The episodes are:56 Military Bike 1 originally aired: 9/5/200557 Military Bike 2 originally aired: 9/12/200558 Yankees Bike 1 originally aired: 9/19/200559 Yankees Bike 2 originally aired: 9/26/200560 Space Shuttle Tribute Bike 1 originally aired: 10/3/200561 Space Shuttle Tribute Bike 2 originally aired: 10/10/200562 Rick's Dream Bike 1 originally aired: 10/17/2005I believe these sets are privately produced by Amazon, definitely not by the Learning Channel's production company. This is a bare bones set. NO special features, not even a disk menu to choose episodes on each disk. Discovery did much better with seasons 1-3, these new sets leave much to be desired, and at around $5 per episode, the price is steep. Still fun if you want to have these episodes. Come on Learning/Discovery- you can do better than this!!!!!"
5,Theravada from a western perspective.,"Ajahn Sumano Bhkkhu is a true gift.This is not a translation. He is speaking directly from the path to enlightenment, in Western terms. A must for anyone with an interest in Theravada Buddhism, a very simple, pure path."
5,SALE ALERT!!!,"I just recently switched to these batteries because they have 2700 mAh! As I started to write this review, I noticed that they are having a BIG SALE on these -- about 1/2 price! So, I ordered several more packages.I see that I'm not the only one who prefers these -- the reviews are good and my experience with them are good.I highly recommend this product."
4,Rechargeable battery,"I am using these batteries in a digital camera, and have been very pleased with the performance. I have been using these batteries for several months, they seem to maintain their charge very well. Recently shot 100+ pictures at a wedding and vacation and the batteries still have a useful charge level."
1,These hold no charge,"I do almost ALL of my shopping here on Amazon. The UPS guy is actually at my house at least once a week. That said, I don't think I've ever written a review here. This will be the first and it's not a good one. That should tell you how strongly I feel about this. These batteries are awful. They do not hold their charge at all. I use them in the remotes for my TV's, and I've had to charge them several times in 2 weeks. A regular battery off the racks lasts well over a year (probably longer), and yet I have had to charge these several times already. Complete waste of money for the time and electricity these use. I'd rather stock up on regular batteries."
2,Not worth the time,"I was disappointed in this book. Although it says the author ""is an experienced and respected author on Eastern religion and philosophy,"" his views on Buddhism are quite outdated and don't reflect the developments in Buddhist Studies over the last twenty or thirty years. To dismiss all of the Mahayana tradition as ""a return to many of the theistic and polytheistic beliefs of earlier societies,"" as the author does, is something no respected scholar of Buddhism of the last thirty years or so would have done. Likewise, to state ""only in the Theravada tradition, together with its scion, Zen, that we can be most confident of finding what Buddha originally proclaimed"" is laughably amateur. No one who knew what they were talking about would make such an unqualified originalist assertion these days, particularly after Schopen.The chapter on Buddhism deals with the subject with which I am most familiar, but it is reasonable to assume that the rest of the book is as dated and fatuous."
2,What Happened?,"Like some other reviewers, I wonder if the middle of this novel got lost somewhere between writer and publisher. The idea itself was fascinating, especially since I just returned from Las Vegas where you can visit several European cities, Egypt, Rome, New York and probably other venues I missed. That part of the book was well done.But what happened to the people? All kinds of interesting characters were introduced and then completely dropped. None of their stories were developed, which was disappointing."
3,"Good idea, flawed execution","I enjoyed the premise of the book, given that England seems to be well on its way to becoming one big theme park, almost overflowing with so-called ""experiences"" to milk tourists. But Barnes doesn't quite deliver on the promise, although the writing is good and the book has its funny moments. I enjoyed the list of essential English traits and objects- only notable ommission was the Beatles (if I remember correctly). Having said this, the book is still worth reading, although I enjoyed The History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters more."
1,"Dreadful, Dreadful","Barnes is cute, totally lacking in substance. The characters are thin, the plot silly and the writing pretentious. The only good part of this time-wasting novel is that in which Barnes has Samuel Johnson say a number of lines in his own words. Now if we had had much more Johnson and much less Barnes, we'd have had something worthwhile."
5,Reader,"I could not trust the brief from the hard cover editions, If you want to compare nationalistm, there is MAUVEIS SANG from Arthur Rimbaud. Mr. Barnes is right abuot England is becoming Disneyland (even Disney was spanish born). He depicts much from the british culture.It is quite different from Spain ( because I'm from a former spanish colohy), where althought there are not becoming Disneyland. After a few years living in the island ( England) it shall not notice such a big difference between US and England. Let the Connaisseur talks."
2,Not really a review....,I couldn't read this book. An expletive is on the very first page! I'd heard that Barnes was witty but not witty enough to realize that most readers don't use obscenities or care to read them.
4,An entertaining vision of capitalism and marketing!,"I would view this book like a sandwich with bread that has become a bit stale. Cut off the edges and you have a darn good meal.The meat of this novel is the center sections, surrounded on either side with sections of a very different character. It is in this center section that we are taken to the real heart of this book: a send up of our 20th/21st century need to repackage and remarket our world.Disney beware...this novel is a view into your fake heart, a clear vision of Marx's belief that capitalism will lead to the commodification everything. If your even an armchair cynic, you will find the heart of this book entertaining and enlightening.Just make sure you push through those 1st 20 pages. They are good, but not nearly as engaging as the middle of the book. Bon appetit!"
4,Barnes back to his best form,"Julian Barnes returns to top form in this witty tale which is satire on modern England and post modern ideas. An ambitious novel less than fully realised the start middle and end do not quite hang togther but theres lots of sport and invention on th ewayYes its his best thing since ""Parrot"" a very easy read"
2,sort of like having Baudrillard over for tea and wig-making,"Julian Barnes is one of the best literary stylists I've ever encountered. He has tremendous skill; and its been shown in most of his previous books, especially Flaubert's Parrot.This book, however, is not nearly as creative as 10 1/2 or Parrot. It's a weak soup of postmodernisms and soggy British pride. England is made again on the Isle of Wight; and during the course of this building it becomes chic to emigrate from the dying whale of the original island. Eventually, England returns to a kind of Eden like grace from which to rebuild itself anew."
2,Kindle Version Has Typos in Practically Every Paragraph,"I agree with many of the other reviewers that the idea for the concept was intriguing and amusing, and that it wasn't executed in a way that I was entirely satisfied with. But my biggest problem was buying this book for my Kindle.There are typos everywhere. I would never hire whoever typed this into its Kindle version as the lowest level data entry clerk, much less a secretary or court reporter. Additionally there needs to be at least one space before the next section of the chapters start as indicated by the 10-15 letters of upper case, but no. And it won't skip from the few chapters or sections to the next. Basically everything that stinks about reading electronically was present in this edition, and what's worse I paid a pretty high price for that."
2,"enjoyable,... if only it were written by Aldous Huxley!","I thought the book was witty in some places but I just wish that its themes of reality and class had been treated in a more, um, mature and serious way. I finished it in a few days and donated it to the local library."
3,Pieces of the puzzle are missing,"As another reviewer points out, there seems to be something lacking in this otherwise very interesting story. It seems to me that halfway through the book Barnes became more concerned with making sociological observations than finishing the story. We start out with the beginnings of understanding about the three main characters: Sir Jack, Martha and Paul but Barnes never completes the picture for Sir Jack and Paul. Certain scenes almost beg to be told but aren't there. And that is a shame because what is there is quite good but like Martha's puzzle of England there isn't enough to make the story whole."
3,England - and beyond,"A rather droll sort of book, with a very English sense of humour. It did perhaps elicit a titter or two. Moreover, one may be left with something of a yearning for the forgotten old-fashioned simple way of life; that of traditional English village of the last section together with a developed repugnance for the crassness of mass tourism and theme-parkism that is slowly pervading much of modernity. Ultimately, though, one closes the book on the largely undeveloped characters and philosophical musings with the feeling that one has merely experienced something of a minor diversion. Wit and sparkle, to be sure. But ultimately something of a `light' work compared to many of the other delightful pieces by this author."
3,Lacking,"This book disappointed me. I really enjoyed the first 100 pages or so as it was fun to see how an idea can become a reality. Ultimately, however, this transition is what let me down during the second half of the book. There wasn't much beyond Barnes' idea of a recreated, authentic England. The most compelling character, ""Sir Jack,"" disappears during the middle of the novel and is replaced by dull, pedantic souls with little interesting to say or to think. The author makes his larger point while leaving a lot to be desired in terms of character development."
3,A Charming Piece,"Is it a cynical exercise in how a country can lose it's own identity, or a love letter to a culture that's left imperialist trappings behind? Or more of a wicked satire of the theme park mentality that infects museums and park? Either way, it's a fun novel with enjoyable characters. Not the weightiest work int he world but still quite fun."
2,The future: England replicated on the Isle of Wight,"Julian Barnes literary Future Watch is a story about an attempt to replicate all the historical landmarks of England on the Isle of Wight. It deals with ultra modern issues like authenticity, cultural replication and Virtual Reality. A bit like 'The Truman Show', a bit like 'Sim City 3000', but never -alas- a great novel."
3,"Good product, Poor customer service","I agree, this software is good. Great detail. The 3D feature is over-rated, though, for my uses. More of an image gimmick than actual representation of terrain. More importantly, though, my software suddenly ""lost"" one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. I also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. Called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. Result: no fix. The company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians."
1,Poor CD,I received a CD that appeared to have been copied from a cracked record. The music is tinny and the crack is easily heard.
4,A Spiritual Treat,"The music and prayers were just what I expected,clear simple, reverent and memorable, a very good exampleof the Taize tradition.The disc, purchased through Amazon,was delivered promptly in good condition, as usual."
2,Disappointing,"Of the various recordings of Taize chants, this is probably one of the weaker, because of the poor quality of the recording. For a good part of the time, you simply don't hear the words clearly, which to me is an essential part of the chants, and the CDs... you are invited to engage, but hardly here."
2,Poor Quality Printing...,"This 'volume' is a poor-quality photocopy. Perhaps it was assembled in this way to discourage further duplication. There's no way I would recommend this for use by my congregation. It does have a nice cover, though..."
3,Charm watch,"This is an ok charm watch. it has the look of a cheap charm braclet with the perk of being a watch. the charms are a lil cheap looking, but for the price you cant beat it."
1,Lo peor de lo peor,"This watch is a piece of garbage, a junk. It never worked. Es una lamentable pérdida de dinero tiempo y NO LO COMPREN, evítense la pena. PLEASE DO NOT BUY."
4,"Good fronts for theater, box in for base","I installed these as front right and left in the basement home theater drop ceiling - they were light enough to require minimal support besides the tiles, boxed in the cavity for extra base. Template was spot-on, everything sounds great. Still need a sub-woofer, though. Used IW6S for the surrounds, needing less oooomph."
1,BIG BUT BAD,"Extremely dissatisfied. These go back. I was eagerly waiting for these three way speakers to arrive. I have smaller audiosource speakers and Hometech HT6 speakers which sound better. The big problem with these speakers is that the tweeter often crackles which is obviously irritating. If it weren't for the crackle, these speakers would have a nice sound. Too bad because if I liked these I would have bought two more pairs."
4,Pocket Bowling,"This is a very enjoyable game that can be played by everyone in the family. However, a password system is used to continue on with a high score in the Tournament portion. I would have liked it better if you could have added your name with a high score as you can in Frogger."
1,"Secrets: The Best in Women's Sensual Fiction, Vol 14",I love anything by Angela Knight and as usual I was not disappointed. After that it became difficult to read the rest of the stories because the book literally began to fall apart in my hands. Poor binding was to blame so be careful before buying anything from Internationalbooks.The book was listed as Used-Very Good Condition. Pages were literally falling out all over the place. I was a combination of stunned and astonished since this has never happened before period much less buying a book through Amazon. I could've filed a claim but that seemed like such a hassle since I bought it for a mere pittance compared to the original price. Still it burned me. Caveat Emptor!!!
1,Extremely bad,How anyone can rate this a 5 is beyond me. There isn't one good thing to say about this poorly directed documentary. Thank God I didn't pay for this.
5,BE PREPARED FOR THE LORD'S RETURN,"Dr. Adams in this DVD showed the ignorance and lack of concern of people as it pertains to the last days. I believe that this is a must see for every Christian and non Christian alike. It will bring awareness to the times that we are living in. It doesn't whether you hold the pre, mid, or post millennial view, the message is clear ""BE PREPARED FOR THE RETURN OF THE LORD"""
2,A very deceptively biased movie.,"This movie is deceptively biased. All the people who were interviewed were in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, one of the most sinful times and cities in the world. Anyone who read and believed the Bible would not be there. Also, the movie promotes the pretribulation rapture. If you believe what the Saviour Himself said in Matthew 24 you would know that the pretribulation rapture is one of satan's most dangerous deceptions."
1,Worst DVD I have ever bought,"This DVD is poorly filmed and produced. I like the subject matter but the interviews were horrible. The people in the interview barely had enough sense to ""get out of the rain."" I am very disappointed. Warning! Do not purchase this DVD."
1,Don't waste your time!,"It is clear when reading about this DVD that the creator has no real idea of the subject matter. According to Jesus, and the Bible, no-one knows the time of the Lord's return. Further, the creator/author appears to believe in the Rapture theories as espoused by the authors of the ""Left Behind"" series...those are false theories. The Rapture will take place, yet it will take place at the very end of time when Jesus returns for the Final Judgment. There will not be a Rapture in which millions are taken and disappear as the fictional LB series tries to say.Stay away from this false DVD wrapped in a cloak of being Biblical."
4,"Hawaiian Language & Hawaiian English Dictionary, A complete",Book helpful in many ways if you want to learn the language. If you have basic knowledge of sentence structure and use of common nouns and prepositions used in Hawaiian this book is very helpful.
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, the title was more promising than the lists of ideas inside. Not as helpful as her other book, ""Presentations for Profit,"" which I rated as a 5-star MUST HAVE book."
4,"Like New, Good IDeas",I haven't had a chance to use the book yet but reading thru the book I can see it has great ideas.
1,Don't Buy this Video....,"The color is washed out...the print is very grainy...this may the worst copy of any film,that i have ever bought....the soundtrack is hard to hear...do not purchase this version of this film...a better copy of this film may be worth it,if you are a country music fan...this movie was shot in a studio & not a very good studio...there is less than a minute of 1966 Vegas in this film."
1,"Poor Jayne, What A Waste!","The Las Vegas Hillbillies is a terrible bad movie which stars Jayne Mansfield, Mamie Van Doren and Ferlin Huskey. It appears to be a low budget film due to the photography, acting and settings. If you are a Jayne or Mamie fan, you will find yourself fastforwarding to their scenes only. One highlight of the film is Ferlin Husky's dream sequence of Jayne singing ""That Makes It."" Air time of Jayne is very small. Trivia: the Siamese cat in the film, which Jayne is holding, belonged to Jayne's friend May Mann."
2,Lack of blonde ambition!,"I only gave this movie 2 stars because of its 2 stars: Mamie Van Doren and Jayne Mansfield. Without the presence of these 2 bombshells, the film is a complete bomb. As a piece of film history, it has its place. As entertainment, it's atrocious, even for the time. Still, as I've said, it does have Mamie & Jayne! The male actors are laughable and the plot virtually non-existent, although you can say that about a lot of modern films too. Only get this film if you're passionate about its 2 lusty blonde actresses. Otherwise, get a life!"
1,Redneck extravaganza on a ...Budget,"This a dreadful example of what Jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat-husbands/lovers.The only reason to watch it would be because Mamie Van Doren was also in it.But be aware (and i read that in a biography about Jayne) that in their contracts was specified that they would NOT appear together in ANY scene whatsoever.So you see them SEPARATELY in different scenes.Also be aware that if you blink,you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties.Conclusion:Get this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ''Ol' South',or someone with a white hood showing his eyes only"
2,Useless web radio,"Got this thing today and will return tomorrow. What is the point of selling a product and promoting its internet radio feature if you don't tell people that you are limited to Live365 radio stations. This makes no sense and is a waste of time when i can find my own radio stations.Also you can't just put in a cd and play the music wirelessly, you have to first download the cd."
4,Hard to Find,"Very good device for it's price. It's not a Bose, but it sounds very good, and it's wireless. I know that Sony has discontinued this item, but when people see and hear mine, they want one, so this is the third one I've bought.I wish you could use both the speakers and the RCA outputs but it's one or the other. The first one I bought direct from Sony and the price was much higher, so if you come across this item on Amazon for $130 buy it before they are all gone."
5,Amazing gadget,"I call gadget coz it has a lot of features, very beautiful and excellent sound quality, i recommend this item for all sound lovers."
2,Compatability,In about 20 phone calls to Sony I was only able to find one person who knew whether the Sony VAIO VGF-WA1/W is able to receive streaming from Rhapsody and he gave me the wrong answer: he incorrectly stated that it can stream Rhapsody. It's a fine item but don't try to get information from Sony.
1,Betty Grable Sings,"Since Betty Grable has always been amongst the top 10 of my favorite stars, I was delighted to hear all of the songs from her numerous movies. She was a beautiful person and I miss her a lot. I saw her in person once when she performed ""Hello Dolly"" at the Memorial Auditorium in Louisville, Kentucky. To my surprise, especially in this day and time, this album, wasn't remastered in sterio or dolby. At the price of the album, you would think it would be. To Miss Grable's honor, you could have done a lot better and manufacturing something very special rather than throw a cheap draft out there for her fans. Like me, everyone probably assumes this album be in sterio. There's not supposed to be any such thing a ""Mono"" anymore."
2,tea,I am quite familiar with white teas and have ordered from several sources or purchased them locally when available. I have NEVER been charged so much for shipping. 4 tiny tins are already in a box but were put into a larger cardboard box (increasing size and weight). I was charged $5.75 for shipping on a virtually weightless shipment of teas. Will do business with Uncle Lee instead
3,sample them,"its cheap but i'll save you even a few bucks more.in the whole pack snowbud tea is the best one, silky smooth full flavored and a little sweet. the others tend to be a little acidi would go and buy a snowbud big pack better"
4,Great White Teas,"I purchased these samplers with my new Zarafina Tea machine and found them to be quite nice. If you prefer the milder taste of white tea over green tea, you'll like these."
2,Too academic for engineers,"This book has too many maths and not very intuitive. It has some fancy alternative algorithms never used in any designs. For engineers working on implementation, there are many other books far better than this one. The early review over-rates this book and is very misleading. Because of these reviews, I purchased this book and found it very disappointing."
5,the comprehensive arithmetic text,"This is the most comprehensive, rigorous, yet readable treatment of computer arithmetic I have yet encountered. The authors are two of the leading authorities in the field. It is a must-own for anyone serious about the subject."
2,Unfortunately it&#65533;s not one of Drake&#65533;s better novels,"If you think ""Knight of Fire"" worth is a read because you enjoyed Shannon Drake's wonderful storyline and characters so much in ""Princess of Fire"" then don't bother. Unfortunately Knight of Fire is rather boring and the characters are quite flat. Fallon and Alaric make an appearance, which is why I bothered to read the book, I was more interested in seeing what had happened to them in their later years. If Drake writes another novel about their children I hope it's about Robin their firstborn son but I'll have to see what people in Amazon.com have to say about it before I bother to buy it."
3,Knight of Fire,"I enjoyed this book, it was not exciting as ""Princess of Fire"" (Bret's parents) but a good read. I enjoy the time period (2nd century)and the setting (England/Scotland). I like the love/hate relationship and whole knight in shinning armor thing. I mean why do most of us read these things anyway. Plus there is a little history thrown in. I am adding these two books to my collection and will read them again. I would love to see more books in the series and hate to leave this family behind."
5,GREAT READ,I DONT AGREE WITH THE PEVIOUS REVIEWS.I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK.BRET AND ALLORA HAD DEFINATE CHEMISTRY.IT HAD THE LOVE/HATE ELEMENT WHICH I LIKE.THROW IN SOME SCOTTISH RELATIVES AND YO HAVE A GRET BOOK!!!!I READ THIS BOOK IN 1 SITTING AND ITS NOW IN MY KEEPER PILE.
1,Not what I expected,This book was my first and last that I will read from Shannon Drake. It was so boring!
5,Great for Resource and Inspiring!,"Great book for anyone wanting to try yoga, or for someone just getting started. I bought this book when I first started getting into yoga and it is still one of my favorites. It is not intimidating and the author's story is inspiring; I thought, ""if she could do this then I can too"". It is a great reference and there are different positions indexed for different issues, and also some yoga posses that are put together in a routine so that you can move beyond one pose to the next and feel the benefits. Great resource! I highly recommend it!"
3,In-Wall speakers,"These are low cost, low performance speakers. They are fine for an office or low use area."
4,Good value speakers.,"The 5 1/4"" ceiling speakers came well packed with adequate wire and hardware. I had them installed, hooked up and playing in no time and they sound fine for the price. A good value for the money."
4,Good value,"I purchased these speakers to use them as surround speakers due to space constraints. They didn't match the front speakers quite well. So, I plan to use them as an additional set of stereo speakers in another room or garage."
5,Can't go wrong for the price!,"Like the others, I read the reviews and was a little skeptical but for my basement I figured how could I go wrong. I installed them in the sheetrock ceiling of my basement. They are connected to a Harman Kardon AVR-635 via the Harman Kardon AB1 remote volume control.I used Music Choice via Comcast as my source and it sounded great. The bass is a little lacking but what do you expect for 5 1/4"" speakers? If you turn it down a tad they will sound excellent. Great sound for the price! I played a variety of music (classical, hip-hop, rap, country, oldies, etc.) and they all sounded great except hip-hop and rap. They sounded pretty good but sometimes distorted a tad until I turned the bass down a notch or 2.Would I buy them again? In an instant!"
4,Great buy,There work great for what I use them for. The sound is good and the bass is just enough without being obnoxious. I use them to provide sound to my second family room which is about 16x20. I have them wall mounted near the ceiling above a closet.
2,"I love Slayers, but not this","I've reviewed the other Slayer's series entries and this one is one of the worst. As I've said before, I don't like Lisa Ortiz not playing Lina. But the problems with this story are deeper than that. This is really stupid. Two golem builders become infatuated with Lina and Naga. They build golems that are models of the two sorceresses. Then the golems battle each other. I sat there watching and waiting to be entertained, but nothing interesting happened. I admit that I laughed a time or two, but overall I can't believe that they did this to my beloved Slayers series. Obviously there are folks out there who enjoyed this one. You may end up being one of them. Everyone has different tastes. If you're thinking of buying this, I suggest trying to watch it somehow before you spend your money. I wish I had."
3,Another good slayers film ...,"GREAT continues the run of Slayers movies that trim down the obnoxiously gigantic and mediocre cast of the TV series and combine them into the powerhouse character of Naga, who always steals the scenes with personality and physique. Here, the beauty and cuteness (and evident lack there of) in the duo is used to wedge the two apart as they become models for golems by a father and son who are at odds with each other. The writer expertly turns D&D on its head with a very straight forward, but fun, script. The kind of tricky depth worked out in the original Slayers Motion Picture isn't here, and is sorely missed. None the less, this is a fun movie, but is it worth the price? I enjoy these movies more then the series, which seems to go in circles and drag on for 26 episodes a season. With Lina and Naga, you know you are getting maximum impact without all the padding."
5,My Favourite Cookery Book,"I've got hundreds of cookery books. This is my favourite cookery book for several reasons. The recipes are fail-proof and the results are restaurant quality every time. The recipes appeal to me and make me want to try them (there are only a handful of things remaining that I've not tried to make yet). The book is as much about lifestyle and style as much as cookery - its refreshing to look at and inspiring to read. My favourite recipes from the book are often the most simple and frequently cook them - midnight spaghetti, vichyssoise & salmon, venetian peas & rice, tomato & basil lasagne, the best shepherds pie you could ever make and a nifty way to cook perfect, tender steaks."
2,Not really very useful unless...,"This book is not all that great unless you are looking for some nice prints of the old tobacco cards from the beginning of the century. But with online auctions and internet access, you may as well go out and pick up a few of the actual cards themselves. Now they might not be as inexpensive as this book, and it all depends on your own personal tastes, but I would much rather spend $20 on a 90 year old card than $4 on a book that reprints them. Of course, it would be tough to acquire 56 different cards from these sets without some monetary investment and time."
3,"Good book, bad title","The book tended to ramble on a bit, but overall, I found it very informative and helpful. The title is this books biggest flaw. The book itself has the potential to help women to tell the difference between a good man who does bad things but can be helped, and a really bad man she should stay away from. Unfortunately, when I tried to get my daughter to read this book, she was offended by the title. Even after I explained the intent of the book, she still refused to take it. She was afraid if her boyfriend saw the book, he would think she was trying to get rid of him and it would cause trouble in their home."
2,Psychopath chapter,Anecdotes are one thing but if someone is going to make a claim that 30% of all men are psychopaths I would like to see the empirical evidence to back that up. The majority of researchers I have found in no way agree with that assumption at all. That is a higher number than the % of prison inmates estimated to be psychopathic.No ethical clinician or researcher would want to give the impression that personal opinions have professional expertise and empirical research supporting them yet all to often anymore proper research is ignored and we get stats like this one.
1,Just another rambling male hating book.....,As I have stated this is just another man hating book that rambles on and on.Do not waste the time.There are many books out there that give answers not just anti male bitter middle aged bitching .
5,Not only for stroke survivors,"Because I am a TBI Caregiver scouting out the competition for my upcoming book: The Caregiver's Tale: The True Story of A Woman, Her Husband Who Fell Off the Roof, And Traumatic Brain Injury, I bought this book to read. I had noticed it on a number of lists, and it was not available locally or in our library extension system. The book shocked me several times. ""She's writing my book!"" I said to my husband, so similar are the situations that Traumatic Brain Injured couples and Stroke couples go through. There are no doubt a lot of similar injuries where caregivers and survivors could glean validation of their responses to medical situations, and some new insight into possible solutions or at least coping mechanisms. I cannot imagine a spousal caregiver who does not see herself in this story. Berenice writes a complete, compelling memoir. Good read. I couldn't put it down."
2,Trying to be profound,"The authors, distinguished though they may be, either MUST have needed to write something for tenure-how else to explain this rather boring, mundane and academically correct (not a virtue) collection-or the publisher needed to fill space in its catalogue. There is simply too little actual fact and too much historiography. Stick to the great Caesar Augustus collection edited by Fergus Millar which covers much of the same ground, albeit with a slightly later time frame."
3,OK but you can't use the memory dial for 10-10-... numbers,"If I can find a similar phone, but one that allows memory or manual dialing in the prefix such as 10-10-987-1 ,(for long distance wholesalers), then speed or memory dialing the number, I will exchange mine. I don't know yet if any memory dial phones allow this. These 18 digit calls must be looked up on the really neat memory wheel-button, (16 digit limit), then punched in manually. Also, it would be better sometimes if the handset screen was illuminated."
2,A step down from my old Sony SPP-ID975 of 10 years,"This phone is a far cry from my previous Sony protable which lasted about 10 years, and unfortunately is no longer made because Sony is out of the phone making business. The handset of my new phone does not light up so I can see the caller ID screen in a dark or dimly lit room. Even in the daylight, the print is so small I almost have to squint to see who is calling. Why was this feature omitted? Why does the base unit stay lit green all the time like a nite light? It should light up only when there is a call like my old Sony. I hear faint static while I'm talking. No matter what channel I switch to while talking, I still hear the static. I plan to return this phone before the month is out for a refund."
1,Don't buy it!,"After doing a ton of research I decided on this phone. It had all the features I needed & I've had only good luck with Sony products. Unfortunately, the phone I received constantly cut out from the first time I used it & had to be sent in for repair to Sony. Sony sent me a brand new one which ended up having the same irritating problem. Amazon gladly refunded my $$."
3,Is it me or is it Sony?,"The features of this phone are great for the price. This is my 2nd sony 900 mgz phone. You guys know all the good features, let me tell you the bad, the ones that are making me return this unit. The worst thing of all, drives me crazy is when I talk on the phone, I hear my own voice sort of ringing in the speaker. Another reviewee described it as ""tinny."" I suppose that's a great way to describe this effect. It's so annoying that I had to unplug this phone. Also, others have griped about this also, why does the base unit's caller ID display have to be continuously illuminated? How annoying. Also, what's the point of having caller ID on the handset if it does not light up during a call? That's useless in dim rooms or at night. All in all, maybe some people can deal with these issues, but for me, I would rather spend more money and get a better phone. Like I said, this is my 2nd sony phone and my last one never had these problems."
2,I returned mine,"Nice features but I returned mine mainly because of the hollow, or tinny, way my voice sounded when I spoke, this was confirmed by other users. The handset display is not illuminated and cannot be read in dim light (this is the only way to review your Caller ID list, the base will not do it). Also I could not put more than 16 numbers into my speed dial making it unusable for accessing voice mail codes.I liked the base keypad and dual display."
4,Can't program 1010811+area code +7 digit phone numbers,"Phone has everything I have been looking for but I can't program 1010811 numbers. The phone accepts only 16 digits. I had this problem before with an old Panasonic which only took 16. I bought a new Panasonic this year and it takes 22 numbers. I believe the 16 numbers is old technology and an oversight by Sony. I am sure it would not be a problem to change this.I look forward to hearing from SONY.Again, I think it is a great product but I have to return it because I have too many phone numbers to enter and I can't be dialing them everytime I want to use them.Thanks AMAZON for your courteous response and help with my return."
2,Do not love this phone!,This phone has lots of nifty features but the speaker system is lousy. It cuts out during use both when speaking and when listening to voice-mail messages. By the time you grab up the handset you have missed a lot. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is a frequent speaker-phone user.
3,It was alright...,"Carmen Wong Ulrich's ""Generation Debt: Take Control of Your Money - A How-to Guide,"" deals with the reason why 18-34 years old Americans are in debt and the primary reason was of course credit cards. The author also provided some basic advice for people who wanted to purchase a vehicle or home, taxes, retirement funds, health insurance and others.I thought the information in this book was quite basic and would be handy for someone who just started out, or even high school students. Carmen Wong Ulrich also provided some helpful websites for people to learn about the various topics she covered. This was an okay book and I think potential readers are better off getting this from the library."
2,"Alright, but definitely not a must-read","I bought this book after reading some good reviews, and I wish I paid more attention to the mediocre ones. Admittedly, the book is an easy read, has a good dose of humor and the author relates well to those in their early to mid-20's (mainly because she's a member of this generation). While the book would be useful to high school students and the occasional completely clueless college student, it offers little to no new information to anyone else. (to give perspective, I'm 23 years old, am a recent college grad and am employed full time) Ulrich simply re-stated well known facts - young adults today are broke, they have too many student loans and too much college debt, etc., etc. - and offered cliche advice. There was nothing in this book that I did not already know, i.e. don't default on student loans, pay of high interest credit cards ASAP, and so on and so on. Overall, not a completely useless read, but you're better off borrowing one from the library."
1,title theft --see the real GENERATION DEBT,"It's a pretty good book as a companion to Generaton Debt (the real Generation Debt by Anya Kamenetz). But I mark this pseudo Gener@tion Debt with the cutesy @ sign down because the publisher knowing of Kamenetz's book deliberately stole her title. And bragged about it all over New York. And then rushed it into the print to make it look the other way around.Nothing can be done about this slimy behavior in the publishing industry but shame on the editor and on Warner Books, that's really disgusting. And the author doesn't show much integrity either accepting that ploy.Yes you can't copyright a title. Instead, people should have more integrity."
4,Good product for hours of fun.,"We had previously purchased the Dora house and needed some more things for my daughter to play within in it. All of the items in this set are great and seem pretty durable. The only exception to this and the reason this product gets 4 stars from me instead of 5 is that Boots' tail comes out pretty easily. Not only is this annoying, but it also seems a little dangerous as the piece is small and probably easily swallowed. Also, note that poseable is a little bit of a stretch for these pieces. Some of them can be bent at the waist and their arms move, but it is pretty limited ""posing"". The rest cannot even be moved. Overall for my 3 year old daughter this was a great gift and one she still has tons of fun with over a year later."
5,Terrific for little Imaginations and Dora Fans,"My 2 year old loves her little Dora Character figures. They are the perfect size to carry around and play with anywhere. We don't have the Dora Talking house but she loves the figures anyway. Her favorite is Dora, Diego, Perrito and Baby Jaguar. But she loves them all. She totes them in her Talking Backpack. The toys sometimes double as bath toys too, which is perfectly fine since they are Plastic. This is a must have for all Dora fans."
1,Availability,We bought the Dora Doll house for our daughter's Christmas present. We CANT find any of the accessories.......I'm hoping these items become available before Christmas or we will be returning the doll house. I feel the same as the other parents. Why on earth would you have doll house but not the accesories available. Especially this time of year. I have been to six stores.
4,"Fun, creative toy. However, too much hoopla over the pieces","I ordered the doll house and the figures at the same time on Amazon about a month before Christmas. When my daughter opened them Christmas morning I was very surprised to see that the house did in fact come with some people including Dora, Boots, and Diego. So, now because I bought the separate set of people, we have duplicates of Dora, Boots, and Diego. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I would have saved some money and not bought the additional set of people had I known before. The figures are very durable and a great size for little hands. Unfortunately, Tico doesn't stay on his scooter, and I agree with another reviewer that it's tough to get the figures to stay seated on the furniture.I'm please with the quality of the house and figures. There are plenty of bells and whistles. This type of toy encourages use of imagination and exploring social skills."
2,A House without Furniture?,"This doll house is well built, but disappointing without the accessories. It would be a 5 star item otherwise. Why would Fisher Price meet the demand of the doll house but not the accessories. Without furniture, the doll house is not complete. I just hope after Christmas, we eventually are able to get the accessories."
3,J. Michael Hayden,"Have you ever listened to a Michael Hayden symphony and compared it to one by brother F. Joseph? If you have, you will know how I felt when reading this book. Mary is 'Betty and Water'."
1,mac user don't buy,"watch the frame you buy only 2007 model are compatible with mac i though i would have gotten a 2007 model because i order it on dec 7, 2007 the picture is really not that great either and the picture freezes up about 5 minutes of use this frame is junk save your money"
4,It's a keeper,"On the strength of one song, ""Son"", I bought this CD. Since then, I've replayed that one along with ""John's Stars"" and ""Pay for Me"" a hundred times. Overall, the songs are polished but still show enough scratches and dents to have an interesting finish, moody but not morose. I did sometimes wish Matt Berninger would have ripped a Tom Waits howls now and then...some of the songs just begged for it. In the end, though, I'd recommend this CD to my favorite friends."
4,This one is totally worth picking up,My favorite National record is still the latest one (Boxer) but this record has more than a handful of classic National songs.Anyone who is a fan of the band had best give this record the time it deserves.
4,A fun film,"It is a great comedy about a garbage collector who gets a chance to be in the NFL and the impact this has on him, his family, and his team. The only negative comment I can make is that the title is too long. Definitely recommended."
1,Attention!,"I have been playing AOM the last 10 years. Lately, I bought a MacBook pro and installed parallels in order to continue playing this game. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It seems it will only run in windows environment and I mean Windows only...not windows on a mac."
2,Doesn't recognize Titans expansion,"Age of Mythology works fine, and I'm able to install the Titans expansion no problem.Unfortunately, when I go to RUN the Titans expansion, it says I don't have a disk in the drive.I've done some troubleshooting...apparently it's not an uncommon issue with this single disk. But no luck."
2,Couldn't play it online.,No offense to the seller. The product arrived just fine and all was well. I just don't recommend this ubisoft version of the Age of Mythology.I bought this because I wanted to play over our wifi connection with my brother. We already had the original version of Age of Mythology. So when we get to the game loading page we discover that the ubisoft version of AOM is not compatible with the original version. Thus we didn't get to play our game.PROS: The game works fine just as itself on my laptop.CONS: The game is not compatible with earlier versions of AOM. When Loading the game into my laptop the machine sounded awful. No other DVD or CD has made the components spin so fast and sound so bad.So I should have just paid the extra money and got the original versions.
1,Don't buy if you want to play online,"This game is being published by all sorts of companies now and depending on who published the game you get is how you will be able to get online. The CD key that comes with the game does not work. If you google playing this game online it will tell you how to fix it. The game I recieved was published by ""value soft"" and on their webpage they list a address you have to mail your booklet too and then they mail you a working CD key. I can't even email for the CD KEY, very high tech huh? Now I have to wait to play the game, who knows how long."
4,Old but still good,Older game but still fun to play. The game seems to be the predecessor to Rise of Nations as the commands are nearly identical and the concepts of buildings and resourses are also similar. I was nervous about buying because I saw that it would not run on Vista but there was no mention of Windows 7. I am happy to say it runs glitch free on Windows 7.
4,Pretty good,"The game arrived very quickly and in good condition.However, though the gameplay is decent, there is much to be desired. AI pathing and attack priority is pretty messed up. Units will target workers before attacking units and defensive structures and, once engaged, they will pursue their targets until you tell them to do something else. Some of the larger units (titans, colossi, etc.) are so large and slow they need to be manually controlled at all times or else they will stand behind the front lines and walk back and forth like idiots until an opening to attack appears (combine this with the retarded priority and you get units that will walk back and forth behind the front lines trying to get at a unit on the other side even though there are enemies right next to him posing an immediate threat).Units need to deal more damage, as battles drag out much longer than they should."
1,failed hopes,"i recieved the game relativly quickly but all it seemed to be was the instalation disk, the disk wouldent even let me play off of it, DO NOT BUY this, buy a diffrent one, u might be expecting the game you know and love but all you will get is half of what you were promised and even then its pretty bad."
4,Mythos Victor,It's very fun to play. I like the genre and that Microsoft continues to please their ability to provide entertaining software.
3,"I cant stand this game, I HATE IT","This game really sucks. For the first month you own it you will love it, sure, blow away your enemy in easy mode. But if you play on anything other than easy... You get ripped to pieces! If you play easy, the enemy waits for you to crush them, if you play anything above, you will lose shamefully. In the campaign, you chase your enemies around, eventually catching up to them at the very end when they have a pyramid that continually produces mythic monsters, you end up using a lot of cheats..."
3,For price good.But Aoe II is the best pc game ever,I think for the price it is great.If you have not played AGE OF EMPIRE II than just buy it instead of AOM .As far as I am concerned AOE II is the best game on pc ever.I have tried to fined another game like AOE II and have not been close to finding it AOE III does not even come close to it so do not waste your money.I forgot this was a review for AOM sorry.
1,Buyer Beware!,Beware! This game contains a generic activation code that renders the game unable online. If you buy this version from this seller you will only be able to play single player.I bought the game as a second copy for the specific purpose of playing multilayer and I was duped.
1,Do Not Buy....Product Key is copied,"The products keys for this product are all the same, and not legit. They are all the same copies. Microsoft will charge you $35 just so you can complain to them about this. This cannot possibly be legal. You cannot contact the customer support of the company selling this product. DO NOT BUY. DO NOT BUY."
2,CD KEY PROBLEM,Dont buy this game from valuesoft there customer service suck. They dont have number to call them or even to email them. I bought this game last week to play online and guess what i cant because of the same cd key that they send to all people.
1,very disappointed with game and publisher,"Bought this game new and everything seemed to be going fine, until I tried to get online and play with friends (the whole reason I bought the game), only to get the message that my CD key could not be validated.All their technical support said was:Unfortunately, we no longer have keys available for replacement in this game. Thank you for your understanding in this matter.How disappointing, and to make it worse they just simply ignored all further inquiries including how I might get a refund. Stay a way from this game! And I'd suggest you consider avoiding ever buying anything from this publisher too--they seem to have no problem with selling you something that doesn't work and leaving you out to dry."
1,DO NOT BUY,I just bought this game and can't even install it. It came without a product key. After reading all the bad reviews I regret I didn't read them before. I had to go online to get one but it will probably wont work when playing online. Which is the reason why i bought this game. THIS SUCKS!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.
2,Classic Game. Horrible Customer Service.,"I bought this game to replace my old copy of AOM that broke a coupld years ago. Unfortunately while the Campaign and Games against the computer are fun the real joy of AOM is playing online. The game i recieved was one of a bundle that ValueSoft released with the same Cd-Key number... this means that you cannot play online. When i tried to contact valusoft for a new cd-key i received the whole ""this game is not covered by our support anymore"".So if you can find a copy of AoM published directly by Microsoft then buy it. Dont buy and through valusoft or ubisoft."
3,Mythology,The seller neglected to reveal that the disc came from Europe and was area #2. The US is area #1 and so the disc will not play on the computerwhich I intended to use. Pretty deceptive seller. Stay away from him is my advice!Age of Mythology - The Titans Expansion: Sybex Official Strategies & Secrets (Sybex Official Strategies & Secrets)
5,Great Research Book For Term Papers,This book shows how Gilman was truly thinking during her times of her youth to her death. She speaks in her own words which makes it great for researching for term papers. I used this book last Fall to research a paper I was doing for Art of Literature class at College. It helped me trememdously and I think it will help others who read it to learn or read it to do research of her life in a paper for school. It is definitley an A+ in my book of books on Gilman's life.
1,A lot of fluff around a single herb aimed only at men.,"Despite the general sounding title, this book is focused primarily on problems with male libido. If you are experiencing difficulties with female libido, this book will be very frustrating to read, and of extremely limited assistance.In fact, their primary recommendation is an herbal ""aphrodisiac"" which, according to the research they cite, is effective mainly on men. On women, they say, it only works on those who don't need it.Save your money. Borrow it from the library if you're interested. Not worth owning."
2,The title and cover are deceiving,"Both the title and cover make you think that you are going to learn how to grade Mint State and Proof US coins. In fact, it does very little of that. When I opened up the book I was expecting to see an organized book with a picture of a mint state coin 60-70 and the expected amount of marks, luster, eye appeal etc. The same goes for Proof coins. I was hoping they would examine all the major types of US coins. Was I ever so wrong. Instead, when I opened the book it resembled a picture book that you would get a 3 yr old. There is very little writing in the book, along with virtually no descriptions. I expected a higher caliber book from the author. I guess what can you expect for $10.00. Stick to Photograde, ANA'S Official Grading Stands, and the Redbook. They are so much better."
3,Drill and Kill made a bit better.,"The game lacks a theme, which given the quality and complexity of some other games available even for Kindergarden, makes it a bit dull. My kids played with it, then never even looked for it again. Some drills are actually hard to figure out, and no obvious resource explains the kid how to do them. It might be worth considering as an alternative to the written drills, if your kid only needs practice, but do not expect to raise math fans with this game."
3,TMI,"The storyline was good, and kept my interest but I found the courtroom narrative to be boring and extremely repetitious. I would probably not have bought the book had I known it would be so plodding."
2,not riviting,"Start of book had me interested. Could not put it down then suddenly got very repetitive, boring. Stuck with the book as I love true crime. Book got interesting towards the end."
1,Riddled with Typos and Grammatical Errors!,"I was familiar with this case and was really looking forward to reading the book. It was such a disappointment! There were so many typos and grammatical errors in this self-published book that I simply could not read it. The book does not seem to have gone through any basic editing at all - and is repetitive and boring as well. I have read many, many true crime books over the years and it is rare for me to not finish one."
2,A Bedtime Story,"I found this book to be compelling at first and then just wanted to sleep. The daughter who remembered her friend getting killed by her father was not believable or likeable. I'm sorry for what she went through just not sure what she was trying to gain from confessing. It seemed to be all about her, not the little girl who was brutally killed."
4,Great for my surround speakers,"I bought two pair of these speakers to act as the side and rear speakers in my media room. I have a Denon AVR-3806 7.1 CH Receiver driving my setup. I don't think I'm pushing these as hard as I could, but I'm very satisfied when either listening to CDs or 5.1 encoded DVD soundtracks.They were very easy to install, with a minimum of tools and fuss. Because of the layout of my room, I had to mount them higher then optimal, but the speaker can be slightly adjusted to 'point' the sound.For my application, I don't think I could beat the price and performance."
3,Optimus Prime Deluxe Child Costume,"Costume went over big in my house - my son loved it. Definitely served it's purpose for Halloween ... I just wish these things weren't so ridiculously priced! But, that's everywhere I suppose."
3,STINK FREE,This product emits a highly offending odor - like ammonia. :( My two asthmatic cats and I do not approve. I could have purchased ammonia from the grocery store had I wanted to clean with it.I'll stay with Unscented Anti-Icky Poo in the future.
2,Did not work,"My cat had a bladder infection and certain areas of the carpet had been soaked with cat urine before be discovered her infection. I read the reviews of many products and decided to try two based on the reviews. Unfortunately, ended up purchasing at least two bottles of the STINK FREE Urine Odor Remover for Cat Urine. I followed the directions and ended up using two full bottles on two areas of the carpet. It did not work as I had hoped. It did take some of the odor out, but not all. The product may be good for smaller areas that are not completely soaked. I am not certain, because this is not how I used it. This is why I gave it two stars over one star. As I stated it did take away some of the odor but did not remove all and did not remove any of the stain. Buy at your own risk. I hope this is helpful."
2,Too small,I got this last year for Christmas for my friend she is a Lucy fan. I thought it was a regular lunch box but it was a mini one. Make sure you read thoroughly before buying it.
1,Be sure of the model,"I bought this thinking it would work on my Coolpix 5000, but it appears to be intended solely for the 775 (I think that's the number). Seems like a nice device, might be worth many stars, but it just doesn't fit a 5000."
5,Buy this book,"This hands-on guide to indexing is worth every penny. It gets novice indexers up and running in 10 simple steps, provides experienced indexers with tangible usability guidelines, and gives technical publications managers a strong business case for developing high-quality indexes. As a technical writer and professional indexer, I found Ament's no-nonsense writing style and real-world examples refreshingly concise and to the point. This is one of the best user guides I have ever read."
4,Good for Beginning Indexers,"I used this book for my first major indexing project and it worked well for me. I appreciated the easy to find details for each step. The process also dovetailed nicely with my modular topic-driven content that could tie back to the steps. For example, to index topics that are considered procedures, I simply followed the steps on indexing procedures. I know that after I get more experienced with indexing I will want to branch out and read up more on the ""art"" of indexing, but for now I'm happy to use Ament's approach."
4,helpful guide,"This guide to indexing is very helpful for beginners and has some good tips for more advanced indexers as well. The book covers the basics very clearly, and it has an encouraging tone that made me feel more comfortable with the process."
3,Well written and mind grabing mystery,"This was the first of the Russell Quant mysteriea I read, and it was while I was on a Mediterranean cruise. I really got into the main character and all the rest of his friends. Everyone sweemed so real and the mystery held me. It was a page turner. The PI is gay, so if you are gay you will like it even more. I left the book with the cruise ship library so some one else could enjoy it."
5,Great Speakers,My granddaughter asked me to buy these for her car. She loves them and they sound wonderful. She's extremely pleased.
3,Good for what they are,Good bargain speakers for the non audiophile types. The speaker pushes plenty of wattage out and was sufficient at both the high and low end for me. These speakers are nothing to write home about but you certainly aren't hurting yourself if you need a good set in this price range.
3,"Badly organized, difficult to use.","This book, published by Faber & Faber, is poorly structured and edited-not up to the usually high F&F standard. Christopher Fielden has provided a prodigious quantity of words, dutifully arranged in sentences and paragraphs. The effect on the reader who might be looking for useful, accessible and specific information on the wine regions, wine houses and vintages of the important producers of Latin America is wearing. The index is next-to-useless,skim-reading is the only way to track down a wine or producer of interest. There appears to be no addressal of vintners, as opposed to growers who produce their own wines. For Chile, I recommend Hubrecht Duijker's Wines of Chile. It is both accessible, accurate in content and well-written."
4,"Great companion, but room for improvement.","It is a great companion to the DSM. However,when the 5th edition comes out, it would be helpful if the editors included a multiaxial diagnosis for each client."
2,Skip it,I would venture to say that this book is a waste of money for most students. The DSM-IV-TR alone is fine. Save your funds for other more informative books.
1,Horrible Camera Work - AUGH!,"I'll get straight to the point: the camera work is atrocious. We want to see the dance here, and instead we see fast-cut glimpses of faces, partial legs, odd zooms from the ceiling, and so on. Often, the editing cuts right in the middle of a dramatic move. It seems the editor is deliberately obscuring the choreography. Only rarely do we see the entire body of any dancer, and more rarely still do we see the larger perspective of all dancers at once. I recommend you see this show live if you can, but the DVD is a waste of money."
4,Forever Tango,This is wonderful to watch if you like the tango. Luis Bravo is excellent along with his dancers. Very enjoyable to watch.
5,war is hell on the civilians,"This book is fiction, but the author actually lived through the events described. The descriptions of people buried alive in air raid shelters, trapped in burning buildings, dying in graveyards while tombstones, coffins, and corpses explode around them are not for those with weak stomachs. This book depicts the firestorms and carpet bombing of a German city (probably Dresden or Hamburg). The same thing happened in many cities on both sides in the second World War (e.g., Warsaw, London, Tokyo). It is a profoundly wrenching story, and gave me the beginning of an understanding of what this must have been like. It's important to me because one of my best friends, now deceased, lived through this and would never talk about it. I'd give this book ten stars for graphic realism and it should be read by those fortunate enough not to have lived in a war zone."
4,A hidden gem,"Excellent writing, excellent characters. Highly recommended as both literature and a terrible depiction of war."
3,"Mary Urbanski ""book club reader""",This was a difficult book to get into. The frist few chapters were long and read very much like a history text book. The later chapters became more interesting. Bottom line while it was a good review of American History I doubt that this would be book that anyone would read for pleasure. It is at times tedious and it would be an excellent read for someone taking a history course in college.
5,I needed this in High School.,Jon Meacham tell us more in this book than I received in 4 years of High School and 4 Years of College. A Must read for anyone interested in who formed this great country.
4,Neither extreme will be pleased.,"In my opinion, this is a well researched, well balanced treatment of one of the hot button topics of our time. The author is very clear in his expression of respect for the founding brothers differentiating between separation of Church and State vs. separation of Religion and Politics. The former was their goal the latter was not. I think they got it right, and in many ways, their prescience is amazing. I suspect that neither readers from the neo-conservative right nor the ultra-liberal left will be pleased with where the author leads them but that is not history's problem..."
1,Pablum,"Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, Adams, and Madison were Deists, not Christians. Deism, not Christianity, was the religion of the enlightenment and of the early American intelligentsia. This work is well-intended, but superficial, and only feeds into the big lie that America is a ""Christian country."" That charade needs to be played out, not played into."
1,Revisionist History,"The founding fathers were freethinkers and Deists. And Tom Paine was an Atheist. Meacham should do some actual research, instead of trying to cuddle up to the Christian theocrats."
4,"A persuasive, moderate approach to the relationship between Church and State","This book provides a persuasive, historically based argument for accepting the important role of inclusive religion in American political life. Meacham shows that God and religion have been consistently important in the language and actions of our political leaders, from the founding fathers to our most recent presidents. He also shows that our religious leaders have historically clung to and united the country around an inclusive, humble approach to God in which a broad array of religions can find common ground. Meacham rejects both militant secularism and intolerant ""Christian Nation"" approaches to the relationship between church and state, and he makes emminent sense."
3,If you need to get a clue...,"I reccomend this book. I liked this book. It was an enjoyable read with many interesting quotes. Meacham's general opinion is middle of the political road and that is probably right where the country should be on the ""God"" issue. He blasts the religous zealot who shoots at the abortion clinic doctor while also leaving it clear that the zealot atheist could learn a thing or two from religion in general with out having to fall on their knees to pray. Reading this won't convert you into one frame of thought or another but it does shed some light on what was going on in the founders heads.The point is also made that the founders may have been a little more religious in public than they were in private. A good point and believable knowing many who are alive today who profess a belief in an all knowing all powerful being then become pretty normal people all the rest of the time. Moderation!"
5,American Gospel,This is a book that has so much meat in it that it will require rereading from time to time. The author says that the wall of separation between church and state is a small one as stated by the founding fathers and repeated by many presidents.
5,American Gospel a keeper,"This is a great book. Mr. Meacham has managed to rise above partisan squabbling and present a balanced, inspiring vision of the finest document of governance ever written and the proper place of individual faith in its execution.This goes on the shelf with books that are revisited and savored."
4,"Balanced, insightful look at religion in our country's founding","If only everyone in America could read this book, for here is a sensible, well-told account of how religion is viewed in our Constitution and in our country. From Washington and Jefferson through Reagan, Mecham depicts how our founding fathers determined ""public religion"" and set the mechanisms in place to keep government out of religion. Ironically, that same mechanism has served to keep religion out of government, and has served to create a climate in which religion may be chosen freely, exercised freely, and that right protected with vigor. Mecham does an amazing job of giving us an overview on a subject that's worth at least three more volumes."
1,If you're a Christian...well,"I thought it sounded interesting but wound up returning the book the next day. If you consider yourself a Christian, you will not get too far into the read."
5,A first rate read,This is an enjoyable book with an appendix that is as readable as the body of the work. History buffs will enjoy the book which offers entertainment as well as food for thought.
5,American Gospel: Clarity about the founding of the nation,"With solid research and absolute clarity, John Meacham tells a story that every political and religious leader should be required to read. Without becoming a partisan, Meacham debukes a lot of myths regarding the religious beginnings of the U.S.When the religious right speaks of the ""values the nation was founded upon"", which values are they speaking of: the values of Jamestown and Mass. Bay colony or the values of Jefferson, Franklin and Washington? Meacham makes clear that there is a difference.The author is encouraging in that he makes a case that the ""center"" position re: religion has always held forth in American. I ""pray"" that, through his book and others, it shall always be so."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DON'T DO IT!!!!THINK AGAIN!!!!In truth I insult good garbage. These discs are worse.Over the past year I used over 500 4x printables, and in thaqt time I had 1 Coaster. 7 out of 7 with these. Discs always gave disc dirty error in player. Defects in the media itself. Visible to the naked eye on 3 of them.Returned the rest of the spindle for a refund.If you need your media to work the first time, you cannot trust Memorex."
2,a bit shallow,"I bought this album based on the clips i listened to on Amazon. The bits of each song gave me the impression of the build ups to what could be a really unique set of songs, but after my initial listen (and in subsequent listens,) this album felt like a bridge to nowhere. I don't hate the thing but i definitely couldn't reccomend it. The recording is kinda stale as well. I'm interested to see what this band does in the future... maybe they are just a bit young on this record."
2,Bachmann bumpers,"Very easy to fit to Bachmann track, but they are not realistic in that the single bumper should be a double, and they should also be spring loaded."
3,Not impressed,The picture is more beautiful than the product. It had scenes all around but not an actually story leading up to the top. Was not impressed at all. Sorry.
2,Not his best,"Poul Anderson had a strange tendency. When his story could be made into a long novel, he made it small (like this one). On the other hand, when his story could be told in 100 pages (boat of million years) he bloated it into something like 600 pages. This story is of course something poul wrote in 2 months, or rather 1, probably to pay a mortgage or smt. It is a little promising, a little of a pager turner and not much more. The notion of the all male/all female spaceships is dated. The deus ex machina earth physicist who discovers the new physics is a very tired and used to death platitude to overcome SF problems. The aliens are too terrestrial. So, read this only if you don't have to pay for it. But better, skip it for Anderson's best novel Tau Zero."
4,Adam and Eve on the Grand Scale,"Poul Anderson can spin a great yarn no matter what. Here he seems to have fun with the silly Adam and Eve story, and turns out a solid, exciting story. Earth is destroyed. By chance a space ship with an all male crew and a spaceship with an all female crew are out exploring and escape the destruction. Their problem is that they don't know the other ship survived. They have to look for survivors and find out how to defeat the enemy. Obviously, if each ship doesn't find the other, the human race will die. Or if they find each other they still have to create a safe place in a hostile universe. With all these problems as background, the result is a good old-fashioned adventure story. And it's extremely refreshing that the women have adventures as well as the men."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I have used these for a long time, and now I can't find them locally. So, instead of calling or wasting gas, I found these on EBay. They were exactly what I wanted. They are GREAT, Exactly as described. Received them FAST!"
4,Better Bass,"One very good thingthe listener who was dissappointed in the bass response could do is ensure there is an acousitcal enclosure on the back side. If the back of the speaker vents into a large space, such as an attic, a lot of bass will be lost there. I use fiberglass and boxes to create a little chamber, works well, once you get the hang of it."
2,Not such a great deal,"I purchased a pair of IW6S speakers 3 months ago so I could listen to music in my kitchen and living room. They seemed like a good deal and I was not looking for great sound from them, just decent background music. Unfortunately, I am disappointed by their total lack of bass and poor sound quality. I was not expecting booming bass but a 6 1/2 inch speaker should produce at least a minimal amount of bass. If I had to do it over again, I would spend a little more money and get a much better speaker"
4,Simple installation and good sound for the money,"I just installed these speakers in the walls in my family room and they work very well. The sound, if not perfect, is good enough for any type of entertaining. I have played rock (The Cars) as well and instrumental music (George Winston) on them and reproduced the sounds very well with just a little less bass (all I had to do was turn the bass up a little on the reciever, and they sounded fine).I recomend these speakers.Enjoy!"
4,Right for the price,"We installed these speakers in the living room and dining room of our new home. Install was a snap, and the speakers are great for ambient music. Our builder offered the same speakers through their installer at about twice the price.If you're looking for VERY LOW priced speakers for nice background music, these are a perfect choice (and much better than the smaller Audio Source speakers). In response to some other reviews, if you're looking for something with lots of bass, then why are you considering a low cost in wall speaker?"
2,"Good Product, Bad Info.","I ordered these speakers to replace existing ones. I tried to be very careful about ordering them because I needed them to replace existing speakings in existing wholes. The specifications of the speakers indicated that they were the exact match for the current ones. However, when I received them, the frames holding the speakers was too big for the current space and I had to return them. I'll try again later..."
5,Breathing Pattern Disorders,"I am glad I ordered this book, and the delivery was quicker than I expected. The book is very informative and helpful; easy reading, and I would definitely recommend it! The Ordering of it was a Good Experience!"
5,This book is a MUST read,"I was tormented with a breathing disorder for 4 years. This book was a tremendous help. I started out hyperventilating 4 years ago and then without me realizing, it turned into a different breathing disorder where I was breathing too slowly. Using the breathe timing and relaxation techniques in this book I was able to identify the issue and expedite my recovery. I've gone from years of almost going out of my mind until now I'm 90% back to normal. I have read a lot of books on the subject, and no other book other then the Bible helped me this much. I hope it will help you. God bless!"
5,The Past Haunts the Present,"George Santayana wrote, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" Much is made, particularly in the Bonus Features on this disc, of the parallels between the obsessively-secretive and vindictive administration of Richard Nixon and our present administration. Whether or not you agree with these parallels, the facts of what Haldeman, Erlichman, Hoover, Thurman and others in power did to a humble rock & roll singer cannot be denied. From the perspective of 35 years on, it's hard to remember the urgency that drove both sides to such acts of desperation.If we are to head off a similar cataclysmic division in society today, we must heed the lessons of history, we must acknowledge and discuss the trends and currents which draw us into the same whirlpools.This documentary is valuable as history, whichever side of the debate you're on."
5,Courage is standing up for what's right in the face of Fear.,"A beautiful film about an amazing man. The universal message of John Lennon and what he stands for echos clearly against today's troubled world. We all know that war is not the answer but we can't seem to learn to live in peace.Imagine,Harve / Miami, FL"
5,"Politics, History, Music...","US lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam. 40% of that during the four years after 1968. John was a troubled orphan who did not have any loving parents at all and wanted to be the Gandhi of his time by bringing peace to US, a country in a war when he was not a citizen of US. The day that he won his case against US Immigration was on his birthday and on the same day that his son was born as well. This documentary offers history, politics and Lennon's path of life with all the beautiful music that he was writing expressing his feelings during those times with the love of his life, his wife Yoko. A must see doc. Double Bravo."
4,WONDERFUL!,I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I LEARNED THINGS ABOUT JOHN LENNON AND HIS LIFE I NEVER KNEW. A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO IS A LENNON FAN.
4,Great movie,hard to believe how carefully the government was watching Lennon. I have always been a Beatles fan so this was very interesting to watch. I just have to wonder why Julian was never mentioned in the film. This was ovious just a film about John and Yoko. Julian did deserve a least a mention in the film. He was after all John's first child even if this wasn't with Yoko.
2,Shallow and Disappointing,"As one who campaigned for Lennon to get his green card and avoid deportation, I found ""The U.S. vs. John Lennon"" shallow and disappointing.I was looking for a more substantial documentary of theKne Brns variety; or something close. The bulk of this production is a recantation of the ""Bed Piece"" promotion and activities that placed Lennon on Nixon's enemies list.Here was an opportunity to go more in depth--that was lost."
5,SIX STAR MOVIE and MORE!,"This movie was superb and beyond! Although there was a great deal of material from previous 'Lennon"" documentaries...This was very well presented and so well put together. It's the truth, the whole truth and nothing but!!As Lennon says: (said) ""Just Gimme Some Trurh!""The best part of the movie for me was John winning his deportation battle! One up for an awesome man, artist, musician, political activist and a living legacy!BUY THIS, YOU'll LOVE IT!!IF you're a Lennon fan, you'll enjoy it even more!! :)Carol in Philadelphia :)"
2,Too Generic,This would have been a much better film had it been edited to 60 minutes. The first 45 minutes could be cut from the film with no loss of informational content.
2,Saw it in Seattle,"Unfortunately, this is a poor Ono-ism film. It is her re-writing of a fascinating period in John Lennon's life that really veres off the ""highway of objectivity"". Does Yoko forget that there really are a lot of us who were alive back then, and that we have watched the documentation examined publically, ad nauseum, over the last 30 years? Yes, going to the theater was another donation to the Lennon estate, and a mere drop in the bucket to what I've spent since the 60's for Beatle-related products, but I can't justify another $19.99 for the eventual DVD release. If it were more legitimate, minus the over-the-top ""Thank you's"" to Yoko from nearly every producer related to the film, I'd relish another addition to my unendingly increasing collection. But NOT for something that overtly excludes the people and situations from that time that Yoko choses to write off (Sir Paul, Julian, etc)."
2,"No ""Sympathy For The Devil"" Here","DEAL with it: I'm Honest. A movie whining about the naughty ol' US's efforts to deport an acidhead who spent 8 years of hs life here walking around with a sign on his back that said ""KICK ME?"" Oh, be serious..."
1,Garbage- Propogandistic Garbage,"What a shame that I wasted my money on this piece of garbage that, for the most part presents one side of the story. At least I now have a coaster for my coffee table.The best parts of this ""movie"" is Gordon Liddy describing when he used a protestor's candle to light his cigar and telling that person that the candle finally had a good use.Liddy also points out that freedom of speech and expression is a two way street, something that those on the left conveniently choose to forget when one expresses an opinion with which they don't agree."
3,Should have been titled Lennon the peace activist,"This movie is about the political activities of John Lennon during the late 1960s and 1970s in which he supported the peace movement. This included public speeches, demonstrations, and formation of friendships with activists such as Rubin, Seale, Hoffman, and others under the watch of the US Federal Government. As a result, the Lennon came under the close scrutiny of the Nixon administration. The latter tried to deport him but he fought and fought, and eventually won his case, ironically on the same day his son was born. The movie ends with his death in 1980. The feel of the movie is liberal, and subtly subjective. Numerous times the movie hints that the US government was out to get him, but only some evidence is provided. Records relating to illegal wiretaps should have been presented. Watching this show, one gets a good feel of the people active in that era of American history, but only some idea of Lennon's contest with the US government."
5,John Lennon vs the US,"DVD was wrapped, in excellent condition arriving amazingly fast. Great price, as well. Would order another product gladly in the near future!"
5,Fabulous movie,"This movie is a must for all people who remember John Lennon. It is also for the younger generation who may not know about John Lennon. You'll see the evolution of a man from a rock musician to a peace activist. It is stunning, informative and entertaining all at once. The extras are as interesting as the movie itself. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the peace movement and be entertained in the mean time."
2,Not a very powerful heater for its size.,"I purchased this heater for our patio room which was the guest room for Christmas visitors this year. I found that the heater took a long time to heat a 16 X 12 foot room, and it needed to be run almost constantly to maintain the comfort of the room. Also the full wattage setting didn't seem to heat any better than the 750 watt setting. I do like the look of it, though it is not terribly stable standing on its own--fairly light weight and topples easily. I suppose it is okay for the money, though I've had little ceramic heaters which were half the price that seemed to heat better, but didn't last very long. It remains to be seen how long this one will last. I never did try the remote, so I can't speak to that."
4,Party Time,The machine is great fun and easy to set up. Plug and play!!! My New Years Eve party guests didn't leave until 7AM because we couldn't get them off the microphone!!!!
1,Problems and BAD warranty,"From the beginning, it could not read certain Karoake discs. Some it could read, some it could not, others it would garble. About four months after we bought it from Amazon, it stopped reading all discs. When I prepared to return it, it only has a 90 day warranty. If you buy it, be sure you can easily return it . . ."
2,Not loud enough,We use this product at our church to play accompaniment CDs. It is not loud enough to be used in our sanctuary and the sanctuary is not that big.
1,Not a good product.,"Just like other's have said, this machine worked great for about an hour. Then it wouldn't play sound at all. I returned it to Amazon and they gave me a full refund."
1,Failed after 1 hour,I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday. It worked great for about 1 hour. Everyone enjoyed it until we switched cd's. Both the microphone and CD player quit working. There was no longer a cd track # visible on the display and all you could hear in the speaker was a slight cracking sound. We returned this item and will look elsewhere.
1,Was fun while it lasted,"I bought this machine for my daughter's 7th birthday (Feb. 2008). It was great fun for the party and we used it maybe twice after that, but it no longer works at all (can no longer read the discs). I contacted the company and they offered suggestions, none of which solved the problem. The warranty period was a measly 6 months, which they must have determined was about as long as the product is likely to last without incident. I would not recommend this karaoke machine."
1,don't buy this machine,I didn't open it up right away because it was for my daughter's birthday. When I did open it up two weeks later it was broken. I contacted the company that I bought it from and they said that they would only take it back after 10 days so basically I was out of luck with them. They told me to contact the manufacturer because there was a 90 day warranty. I have sent the machine back but I can't get an answer from them after numerous emails and calls. It is a huge hassel and not worth it. I do not recommend buying anything from the singing machine. Also I had to pay to ship it back....bad bad company!!!!!!
1,Cheap Junk,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas. It worked for 2 weeks and then just quit - power problem. I got a replacement from Amazon and right out of the box, it didn't work. Static noise and the volume could not be adjusted, when the mic is used the music cuts out. I followed all the trouble shooting instructions but no luck. What a disappointment!! Luckily Amazon will still refund it since I just got it but I don't want to take a chance on a 3rd unit and have it die in a few months and not be able to return it."
4,Great for the price.,"I just purchased this for my 6yr old daughter for Xmas. I did my research for 2 wks on any and all Karaoke machines. Now I'm not looking to have Karaoke night's every Friday, so I wasn't interested in anything to fancy or expensive. Just some simple fun at a fair price. And if that's what you want, this is it. I've read all the reviews on this machine, good and bad. And with anything, I took a chance. And I'm very happy I did. I just received it today. I opened it up to make sure it worked and was in good condition. And it was. It's a sharp looking machine. Easy to use and operate and carry for a 6yr old. I'm very happy. And for the price It's a steal. I know my daughter will love it.The volume on the microphone sounds great, loud and clear. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven't played a cd in it yet."
3,It does what I expected,"The SMG-137 Karaoke System does what I expected. Not great, but satisfied my wife and daughters."
1,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed (and so was my little granddaughter) to find that her much-anticipated Christmas gift didn't work. It was taken to a nearby department store for possible exchange rather than return to seller and risk getting another defective Karaoke machine. A gift card was issued to be used when more were in stock, but so far, my granddaughter still doesn't have a Karaoke machine."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"The Singing Machine company does not support its own products. I purchased one and needed a replacement part. They don't carry replacement parts. I asked how to repair the problem, they basically said ""too bad"", purchase a new machine. These are cheaply made, and will break. So if you have one, take very careful and good care. If it breaks, it is trash because they will not support it or carry replacement parts."
3,Singing Machine SMG-137 CD+G Karaoke System,"We daughter received this for Christmas. It did provide a lot of entertainment for our family, but the microphone it comes with isn't very durable and we have had to replace it. It is also a little bulky in size, but it is a well used toy in our home when the family gets together."
1,Defective!,"I bought this item as a Christmas present for my grandaughter and of course, it didn't work. I'm in the process of sending it back. We could only get power out of it if we tipped it back. Eventually we got some sound out but when we got the words on the TV screen, they were all jumbled. To say the least, we were looking forward to some family fun and didn't get it from this machine. And apparently, they are discontinued so I can't get it replaced nor can I get a refund on my shipping charges."
3,OK but......,"I was hoping at least one of the 3 extension ports would be a standard flash single pin extension. But no, they are all the Nikon 3 pin connector so all u can connect is another Nikon device with the 3 pins. The shoe is standard."
1,"good idea, BAD design","the worst reviews were more than a year old so I was hoping the design had changed, but not so. read the instructions and followed them. Cracked with first use! Very disappointed."
1,It imploded just from the vacuum. Very poor.,No good. Imploded. Wouldn't buy it if I were you. Terrible product. Would not recommend it to anyone. Want my money back.
2,Foodsaver T020-00079-010,This Canister appeared to be a great addition to the food saver set but it busted open in the middle of the night with a big bang during my second use of the canister.
1,THESE THINGS ARE JUNK!!!!,WHEN I FIRST GOT THESE CANTAINERS THEY WORKED FINE THE FIRST TWO TIMES I USE THEM. AFTER ONLY THREE USES THEY HAVE CRACKS IN THEM. WHAT A BAD CHOICE I MADE HERE.!!!!
3,Had my first cracked canister,"I emailed their Customer Service to inquire as to the availability of replacement parts, after one of my rectangular canisters developed a crack across the bottom.They merely stated that ""Unfortunately, the canister is not available separately."" There was no mention of any failures that have occurred with the canisters, but I suspect that they no longer sell them because of the failures that have occurred.No mention of warranty replacement, since mine was about 9 months old.So far, 3 other canisters have not cracked, but I wonder how long it will be."
5,Versital FoodSaver,"I have been using FoodSavers for years. I recently bought 2 of the 2 Quart Rectangle Canisters and love them. The size is perfect for left overs from meat loaf, spaggetti, BBQ and most of all I love to Marinate in these containers. The lock down sides guarantee a tight seal, the containers are large enough and crystal clear to see what you have in them. Easy to seal & reseal. What can I say If you hate to throw away good food buy these canisters."
1,Do Not Buy,"These canister will cracke .....and foodsaver will not replace item after 30 days, but they will give you a 10% discount to buy another"
2,Foodsaver Containers Impossible to Stack,"I love the Foodsaver vacuum sealer, but found these hard plastic containers are poorly designed. What they didn't consider was refridgerator storage and stacking. The rounded tops prevent stacking and saving space on an already cramped fridge shelf.The vacuum valve at the top cannot get food on it, because it's impossible to clean. That problem is addressed on the less expensive Foodsaver containers that simply have a rubber flap that seals once the a vacuum in achieved. But even they have that slightly rounded top again, making is impossible to stack.The problem is solved by Foodsaver's new ""Freshsaver"" containers, which are smaller, but flat on top.I have a whole cabinet filled with Foodsaver containers that are more trouble than they're worth."
5,foodsaver canister,great vacume packer but have to be careful not to wash when cold will eventually crack or I think that is what is making them crack.
1,"Yup, cracked after 4 weeks of use","Hate to admit it but I am also one to have a cracked 2 quart canister. Two 3 inch cracks appeared at two vertical corners. Looks like the plastic is too brittle and the sidewalls flexing under the vacuum load create stress points that the plastic can't handle. Major bummer since it a great idea and when it works, works very well!Update: DO NOT BUY THIS!!! Two replacments from Tilia cracked and the one I gave as a gift to my dad cracked as well. The smaller versions are holding up ok but the 2 quart is a no go."
1,Cracked after first use!,"I purchased this from Amazon directly to keep cookies from going stale. On the night I received it, I took it out of the box, hand-washed the base, put cookies inside, and vacuum-sealed it using a V3840. The next day I opened the two tabs on either side of the lid to find the top just sitting on the base. The suction hadn't held. Upon further investigation, I found a one inch crack in the clear base by one of the handles. I tried vacuum-sealing it a few more times, but the air is getting in through the crack. I agree with other reviewers that the hard plastic canisters (not the flexible plastic lunch or deli containers) need to be redesigned with stronger materials. I'll update this review when I have discussed this with FoodSaver."
1,Problems from day one,"My Sony RDRVXD655 was a problem from day one and I haven't even used it for what was intended-transfering VHS tapes to disc. Using DVD's, the picture would stop & skip. This problem went away and now the picture has, frequently, a fast vertical 'jerking'. Totally unacceptable for viewing. Now to have to go to the trbl of repacking and returning for repairs/replacement. Heck, I should have bought one of this model that was used and saved some $'s. (I had to click on one star since 0 stars is not available)"
4,Sony RDR-VXD655,"I found the product easy to install and setup. The menu screen allowed a scan of off air channels and I was watching HD in just a few minutes. The shortcoming of the HD tuner feature is that this HD tuner does not allow viewing of the available off air program schedule and there is no ""previous channel"" feature on the remote -- making it necessary to scan channels one at a time or keying in the channel number and pressing an enter button - very cumbersome. Overall the pruduct works well and the copying of programs to the DVD or dubbing from VCR to DVD is easy to do."
2,Not for people with antenna's,Decent system but has some problems for people who have to use antenna's. You have to turn your antenna to get your stations on tv but with this unit you can not just add the channels if they are digitial. You have to rescan for digitial and in the process you lose the ones that you already have on the unit from the previous scan. We are very dissappointed in this system for that reason.
3,not as easy or intuitive as earlier model,Not as easy to set up as ealier model I own and very confusing directions if you have a cable box. Maybe that is because the earlier model is connected to satelliteI have to switch back and forth from video 1 to antenna to either copy to my dvd or play back. That may not be the recorders fault but due to the cable company which would rather sell me their dvr.The earlier model has been without a problem for over 3 years and over a thousand dvd recordings
4,"Get this, not the Panasonic!","I wrote a positive review earlier for a Panasonic DVD/VHS with tuner, but then it started locking up on me (just like the other reviews said!), so I am retracting my review. Now, I took back the Panny and got the Sony; what a difference. Very easy to set up; it only took about 4 minutes to scan all the channels; picture looks great on TV and on DVDS, and dubbing VHS to DVD is easy. The Sony just seems more intuitive to operate than the Panny."
3,I prefer the Panasonic - DVD-R/-RW/+R/+RW/RAM Recorder/VCR Combo with Digital tuner.,"I have both recorders and I saw the difference. The Sony: You cannot record movies from movie channels like HBO ect. In the Panasonic yes you can. The record quality is better in the Panasonic. As a costumer that has both I recommend the Panasonic - DVD-R/-RW/+R/+RW/RAM Recorder/VCR Combo with Digital tuner than Sony.. My favorite brand is Sony but I was disappointed with this.Bad quality in recording in 3H (LP), 4H (EP), 6H (SLP), 8H (SEP)recording modes and cannot record movies from movie channels (Copy protected movie). Well now you know. The right choice right now is Panasonic."
4,Sony DVD/VCR burner,all in all it seem to work well - the receiver is a little weaker than the sony TV and it does have the problem of not being able to add channels manualy - why I'm not sure but with a digital signal if it's a weak signal you will not see it anyway - maybe just blocks of color - it does have good video and you can output it in 480 or 1080 so it can make a DVD look better - maybe not as a good as Blue-ray but still very good.
4,dvd / vcr recorder - player,Completely happy with this; VHS is VHS but recording on the DVD side (2hr mode) is very clear. It take a few seconds to read the disc but other than that it works fine. This is my second one.
1,Sony DVD/VCR,The picture quality was very poor. It was also difficult to program. I returned it to Amazon and purchased a Toshiba DVD/VCR which is much better (and less expensive).
2,The 1-button dubbing flaky and video compression inferior,Overall this is a good DVR/VCR combo but it falls short when dubbing large VHS collection to DVDs. If you are dubbing VHS tapes which have a lot of clips or programs recorded on them the unit will sometimes interpret gaps between the clips/program recordings as signal loss or end of tape and prematurely terminate the dubbing. Because of this I could not use it to copy my VHS collection to DVDs. Instead I had to use a 2nd DVR unit. Also the compression ratio and algorithms used are not as good as the ones used by my 2nd DVR (which is a Philips). The Philips has a LP option for DVD+R DL that allows 6 hrs of recording which is perfect for 6hr VHS tapes. With the Sony unit I had to choose between 5 hrs and 7 hrs plus change and the 7 hrs required to dub a 6hr VHS tape produced inferior video quality compared to the Philips DVR.
3,Hookup was not easy to accomplish,"Getting all the cables connected correctly along with the correct input setting for each device was not easy. I tried to record movies from the satellite receiver 3 times before having success. Once everything was connected and set correctly, the recorder combo was easy to operate."
4,Won't disply CC on network channels,Everything seems to work well except I found that the closed captioning from the network channels only will not display on my TV (Sony XBR4. It will record CC and display when played on any other VCR connected to this TV. But it will not even display CC on network channels that were recorded on other VCRs. Called Sony and they could not help. Said they often get this complaint on this model but blamed it on the cable provider. This makes no sense as the Sony TV and all other brands of VCRs display CC on these channels. It may be a design fluke that Sony just does not want to recognize.
1,I'll never buy a Sony again..,"This is the 2nd Sony product that has self destructed within a couple years. The last one would not finalize, and this one will not ""Format"" new blank disk to be usable.I took a chance on this one being a few yrs older. Obviously Sony didn't get the memo from it's customers because their products still suck. On top of that, you can't record stuff you have already paid a fee (from your dish company)to record and watch within the confines of your own home.Tonight while recording a cartoon for my grand daughter, the dvd player went into a ""Format"" then scratched the disc then crashed! I could not believe it!Bottom-line, do yourself a favor and ""Stay away"" from Sony. Once again, ""Stay away"" from Sony! I hope they are reading these comments. Terrible product. ""Stay Away"". Have I made my point? ""STAY AWAY from SONY"" If it were possible I'd give them minus stars. Did you hear that Sony? Minus stars.."
3,Need the best DVD recording quality,"I purchased this unit over a year ago and purchased it to archive old VHS tapes I have and to record DVD's from my cable box. The first disappointment I had was that the unit did not have a HDMI input so I could get the best picture and sound quality from the recording source. It does have a HDMI output but I want to be able to have the best recording picture quality for recording DVD's. Also, on occasion, I have been unable to get my recorder to function using the one touch VHS to DVD function. I follow the instruction in the manual but,the unit will not respond when I use the controls on the front panel.;Now that the unit is no-longer in warranty I don't want to spend extra money sending it to the repair shop for the easy way to record from VHS to DVD. I'll just use the standard manner in the manual.Help!! If anyone knows about a DVD recorder that has a HDMI input please let me know!!!"
4,sony DVR,"I have the DVR for over a year and it is still working. The tuner could be better but compared to another name brand that basically died after a year, its doing great. Would like to see them go to small hard drive and move away from tapes."
1,Not Happy,"I purchased this combo DVD/VCR player for my exercise tapes, which I use daily, since I have a wide collection of both VHS & DVD's. And I've always liked the user-friendly aspect of Sony products. However, after only 4 months, both DVD & VHS tapes started freezing in the middle of play. Not good when you're right in the middle of your morning work-out.Because of security features Sony now installs in their devices to forestall piracy, only the Sony company can do repairs. So, even though it was still under warranty, I'm required to ship it back to them at my expense. After 3 months, they sent it back, saying it couldn't be repaired, only replaced. Yeah, like I want another one!Instead, I purchased a Pioneer DVD player that doesn't install such security devices. All I want is a reliable, consumer-friendly player. Not one armored for warfare. No more Sony's for me."
2,Defective Sony DVD/VCR unit.,"The Sony unit would not put out a color picture, only B&W.; When fast forwarding a VHS tape, the TV screen went blank.Seller is now trying to fix the unit."
1,"Item damaged in shipping, so cannot review","This item would have been a great item to have, but unfortunately it was damaged in shipping and the seller had to file a claim for damage and we were refunded our money. Thankfully, amazon has a money back guarantee for issues such as these."
1,Does not work with Directv receiver,"The ""built in HD tuner"" does NOT work with satellite Directv. It took me hours to discover this. A couple of hours on the Sony tech webchat (two levels of support) and finally referred to telephone support in order to find this out. The recorder can only operate via the satellite receiver's tuner which severely restricts the recording possibilities.I was unable to find this information anywhere in the literature or in the manuals.The ""built in HD tuner"" may well work with a cable system, but it was unsatisfactory for my use. The lack of this information upfront is what merits this item a single star."
1,This item sucks,This product does not work with a simple TV set. It requires seperate component audio/video hookups. This was never made clear in either the advertising material or manual. I want to attach a simple coax cable but I needed to connect a 3 wire audio video cable as well. My TV doesn't have these connections so it is useless.
4,SONY DVD player-recorder,"Haven't really used it much yet, but if it does what it says, I'll be happy as a clam on the beach."
5,Inspirational Sensation!!!,"I found the all the stories and moral lessons to be very touching, and humorous. I would higly reccomend it for anyone who is going through hard times. Definately one of Mr. Mohammed's better works."
5,Great tell-all book!,This was an unbelievable glimpse into a mans life. I recommend this for every single father & mother.
5,"Compelling, inspiring TV","I couldn't stop renting these DVDs once I started; it's creatively inspiring, compelling, entertaining - I could watch this all day. I'm not even that into fashion, but I'm a designer (graphic) and this is a must-see for all who pursue creativity of any kind. It's really a study of creativity on the fly and all the characters that inhabit the world of design. I love, love, loved it!!"
1,I NEVER GOT IT FROM MEDIARAVE AND THEY STILL BILLED ME AND GAVE ME THE RUNAROUND WHEN I TRIED TO GET MY MONEY BACK,"NEVER BUY FROM ANYTHING THAT SAYS IT COMES FROM MEDIARAVE! IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET HELP UNLESS YOU FORMAT YOUR COMPLAINT EXACTLY HOW THEY WANT YOU TO AND EVEN THEN YOU WILL NEVER HEAR BACK FROM THEM! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
5,Completely satisfied!,This show is great and I was so excited to be able to purchase it brand new at such a good price.I ordered the dvd set on a Saturday and received it the following Monday. It doesn't get much better then that.
4,Project Runway Season 2,"The dvds played perfectly but the inside plastic casing holding the dvds was broken when I received them. Bit of a pain, but overall fast shipping and the dvds themselves are fine. Thank you!"
4,Great Show,This is such a great show. It's strangely addicting. I find myself looking at fashion and actually caring what I wear.
4,Great head phones,Sony thinks of nearly everything! They even give you a wire so if you want you can hook these up to your walkman and use them for regular headphones.*The radio picks up very good*They have a nice red display so you can see how to tune in the dark.* and they only use 1 AAA battery so they are very light
5,Solitude!,"I loved this book as I did her first. I relate well with her lifestyle, for it is mine too. I worship the solitude living alone can give me. I can laugh along with Amy as she battles the Wasps and spiders. I can share her fun at being able to walk ""nekked"" in the house whenever needed and in the fact we are not bound by someone elses rules. Noone can tell us how or when the house should be clean. Ms Blackmarr is my hero :-)"
