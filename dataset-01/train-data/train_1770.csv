3,Yes and No,WORKED GREAT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BUT NOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. HAD TO JERRY RIG. THE ANCO BLADE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE HAS THE HOLE TO BIG. SO BEWARE OF THAT. ANCO SAID THE BLADE WOULD FIT MY 1991 TOYOTA. IT DID NOT FIT THE ARM. SAID I MIGHT HAVE TO USE THE SIDE SADDLE. THEY LEFT OUT THE RUBBER GROMETS ON THE WIPER.
5,Worth the money,"This bird seed has created a turf war between the neighborhood birds. They LOVE it! It definitely brought a larger variety and since it's no waste, it lasts so much longer! I have beautiful song birds hanging around now. Definitely recommend."
2,Great Band- Hideous Anthology,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE this band. But this collection is almost unlistenable. The tracks seem just thrown together in what's got to be the WORST possible order, and there's WAY too many B-Side-type filler songs. This album is impossible to listen to all the way through.If you're looking to get into X, procure ""Los Angeles"" and ""Wild Gift"" first, and proceed from there."
3,"I love the songs, but.......",Man I wish there was a way to replace Exene's vocal tracks with someone who can sing....or just mix her WAY down low---she is just TERRIBLE!!!
5,The Dummy Man!,"WOW IS ALL i CAN SAY! His first solo joint and it's a classic 2 cd's deep and every track is diffrent,he goes from where my thugs at to paper to dummy man (my personal favorite)to pimp dem ho's with eightball and mjg to the war is on to thug mentality then disc 2 he takes you from smokin budah to the night riderz to mariah I mean he is all over it go get this cd before you spend another dime on anything you won't be disapointed."
5,Another great album from tha best group in tha world!!!!!,"Nobody can see B.O.NE. at all, so eveybody that's hating on them needs to stop, drop, and jump off tha sacks of these true playaz. B.O.N.E is simply the greatest of all time, in the universe, and they deserve props from everybody. And if you don't like hearing that, you could just sukk it like the original thugsta, Eazy-E, said. ""T.H.U.G. we be""- that's right, Bone. Keep on thuggin' it..."
4,Shoulda just been one disc,"This could have been one of the tightest CDs of 1999, but this double CD contains waaaaaaaay too much filler material. All of disc one is tight except that idiot ""Dummy Man"" track and skit, and ""Drama"". But disc two was mostly filler material, and ""Slient Warrior"", ""Shoot da Club Up"", and ""Smokin Budda"" were tight but were cut short. Those Knight Rieduz sound like a bunch of kiddie cartoon show characters rappin', at least the beat on their track was kickin'. The four best tracks on disc two were ""Where my Thugz at"", ""These Dayz"", ""I Still Believe"", and ""We Starvin"". Krayzie Bone runs circles around his guests talent wise. Only being shown up once by MJG and Layzie Bone. This is a must buy if your a bone fan. If not, you should listen before ya buy."
5,I Love You Baby,I love you and your Cd. Keep it up. Dont let them other people bring you down. I just love you.
5,Krayzie is bangin'!!!!!,"Granted Bone Thugs are by far at their best when they are as a whole, but Krayzie did tremenously phat job on this album! Yo, it may be 2 discs long, but hwo cares??? Any true Bone fan isnt gonna care. I like almost every song on the album and it was great hearong Bone together in Thug Alwayz. If you dis this album, you need your head check, CUZ IT IZ BANGIN'!!!!!!!"
5,Krayzie Bone is tha best and his ablum is off tha hook,Krayzie is the best rapper/producer there is right now and his album is the best bone album sine E.1999 and if u dont have it yet u bettre go get it cuz if u dont then u havent heard Bone.
5,Great!!!!!!!!,"Krayzie Bone and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony are some of the best out there, and this is a great CD.Buy it!!!!!!!!"
4,TIGHT,"This cd is the best rap cd of the year so far...i cant stop listening to songs like, heated heavy, thug alwayz, thug mentality, theyre phat. there could have been a little more work on disc two, i dont even think ive listened to that one 2wice. also too many dumb skits. overall though, very good cd, i recomend it!"
5,WOW!,"What an amazing double disk album from Bone thug in harmony's most talented and breath-taking member.it is simply the best album from Krayzie Bone, no question!"
5,Proven Thug,"Amazing amount and tracks and even more amazing the number of quality songs. Some of the fastest raps ever, touching lyrics, and lots of famous voices. Krayzie has catchy beats that you can listen to thoughfully or bump on the streets. Once again, Bone Thugs do it again, Bone forever."
4,Thuggish Ruggish,"This album from Krayzie Bone is a very good album. Once you listen to it, you'll see that Krayzie took his personal talent and exposed it to the maxx. He produced his album and truly gave it a style of his own. He broke away from his Bone Thugs imagine to create himself as an indepedant artist. Tracks on this album vary but he has some strong lyrics messages and some very nice bass to go along with the outstanding vocals he makes. He has many guest-apperances including: Mariah Carey, Bone Thugs, Joe,the late great Big Pun, and Fat Joe. This album is for the straight rap listener. He is missing the slow vibe, but he has the fast beat mastered."
4,Krayzie Bone holds it down,"Krayzie Bone did well on this. I remember thinking it wasn't as hard as the previous Bone albums, specifically E1999 and Creepin, but it holds up pretty well after time. If you like Bone then you will definitely dig. Check the bonus track he did over the ""Moments in Love"" song by the Art of Noise it is sick. My other favorite track is Heated Heavy."
2,Krayzie Bone be da Bomb Syke!!!!!!!!,"Krayzie Bone's first album as a solo artist neither fails completely nor captivates the listener as his former Bone-Thugs and Harmony achieved. Krayzie, the second member of the former rap group to release a solo album, fails to convince the listener that he has a music career after Bone-Thugs and Harmony. Krayzie does not let his street credit slide in this album; giving Bone fans something to cheer about. However, Krayzie fails to realize what has made Bone Thugs and Harmony successful. Lyrics derived from the street with vocal harmonies and catchy choruses. Krayzie Bone continues with the image of the group but fails to accomplish what the group did. When Krayzie and Bone-Thugs and Harmony collaborate on certain tracks, the teamwork and harmonious vocals are tremendous, creating a tune, listeners enjoy. This enjoyment lasts very short as Thug Mentality does not seem to captivate my mentality for good music."
1,Please,"I found this album really hard to listen to. I never bought an album that i did not like untill now. Please people....save your cash, don't buy this disk. I promise you that it is BAD....I threw it away. It is now collecting flys at the City Dump."
1,Flat,what makes Bone work is themselves as a group but as solo Rappers they sound flat.The Lyrics&Music are very predictable.what's up with having Mariah on your Disc? as A Group Bone is still alright but forget the solo Projects.not only was this One disc too Long but it should have been a Ep not a Album.
4,This CD was tight...but it was lacking some new sounds!,"This CD was worth the money and the wait. But, I think that it should've had some new sounds instead of following the same style. They still got it though. The more I listen to it the more it grows on me!"
5,SUPERTIGHT - IF YOU LIKE BONE BUY IT,"Krayzie holds it down on almost ever track. Its one of the best double albums I've ever bought. Not full of those fill in tracks. ""Where My Thugs At"" and ""Heated Heavy"" are the two most rip it up tracks. The duet with Mariah is sweet, they mix good together. The songs with MJG, and the Terror Squad are also way tight. My only complaint is to send the Knight Riduez back to the freak show. Can't wait for Bone's triple album."
2,"Some info, but inadequate.","The book is fairly extensive when dealing with mechanical issues, and the photos and illustrations that are present are clear and helpful, though more would be better. Where it falls down is in dealing with the electrical and emissions systems. There is not enough information regarding the location of parts, and especially where electrical systems are concerned, the author too often falls back on the phrase, ""take the vehicle to a dealer or repair shop for service."" Even if the part is not repairable at home, a little more information on how it works and what might be wrong would be appreciated. The wiring diagrams in the book appear to be generic, and in the case of my vehicle, are partially incorrect."
3,Who knows,How would I know if it works or not? My dog doesn't talk. I hope it works and keeps her young as she grows older.
2,When you're smilin',"The eight-page booklet for the soundtrack to A SMILE LIKE YOURS features a dozen small movie stills. Songs are mostly 60's soul, plus Natalie Cole's version of the title tune and two other modern selections.Fidelity is mediocre on some of the older stuff. This one's strictly for soundtrack completists or fans of what is a rather minor comedy film.TRACK LIST--{M} = mono[4:23] A Smile Like Yours - NATALIE COLE[3:25] Baby, You've Got What It Takes - MARTHA DAVIS and IVAN NEVILLE[2:35] Where Did Our Love Go? - THE SUPREMES {M}[3:25] I Heard It Through The Grapevine (live) - IKE and TINA TURNER[2:48] I Got You (I Feel Good) - JAMES BROWN {M}[2:45] My Girl - THE TEMPTATIONS[2:57] Too Busy Thinking About My Baby- MARVIN GAYE[2:22] Love Will Keep Us Together - KIRBY COLEMAN, DOONEY JONES AND BILAL MUSLIM[3:05] Ain't No Woman (Like The One I Got) - FOUR TOPS[2:22] Sleep Walk - SANTO and JOHNNY {M}[6:35] Isn't She Lovely - STEVIE WONDERTOTAL PLAYING TIME: 36:42"
4,Queen Anne Console Table,"As already reported two weeks ago, the table was fine once I found the hardware need to fasten on the legs. The packet containing the screws and metal circles had come undone and the pieces had all spilled out. After combing through the various layers of cardboard packing I managed to locate all of them and put the table together. It is now stury, attractive and useful."
3,I want my Malice,This is just an EP but being a Malice fan had to have it my collection. If you can get a hold of License To Kill or In The Beginning get them questions. Just happy i have all 3 on disc. Another band that was way under-rated.
1,"KV 6500 Series Full Extension Precision Ball Bearing Slides With 1"" Overtravel 14""","On first glance these look like terrific slides. They look well made, are hefty, and slide smoothly. However, I found these drawer slides difficult to install. They do NOT come apart so that the drawer part and the cabinet part can be installed independently. After very much deliberation we determined that the small thin QD rail is suppose to be attached to the cabinet and the entire slide attached to the drawer. In addition, it is difficult to attach the slide to the drawer since it is difficult to use the holes for the screws; several of them are hidden. Mainly, I do not have confidence that the QD rail will support 125#. I am trying to find a way to jury rig these slides, or force them apart, so that I can install them."
4,Snow: Canada's Vanilla Ice?,"One might think that... but in reality, Snow is a very original artist, combining Hip Hop music with a fun Jamaican accent. His songs combine great, original, old-school beats and cool lyrics, but at times he can be hard to understand. However, if you must know every word, follow along with the lyrics written in the CD insert. ;) Fans of Snow and Hip Hop or newcomers will not be disappointed."
1,The Greatest Hits Of WHO?????,"I had to laugh when I saw the title of this album: THE GREATEST HITS OF SNOW. LMAO! What ""Greatest hits""? The only minor hit he had was Informer....And even THAT sucked!!!Oh well, Licky Boom Boom.......They just don't write deep meaningful lyrics like that anymore.BOB MARLEY must be spinnin'! So skip this joke and go buy BOB MARLEY: LEGEND!"
4,Ive always liked,"Sugarcane Harris.I first heard him with Frank Zappa.Directly From My Heart To You was always a favorite.This album and Fiddler On The Rock both showcase his talents quite well.I always thought he and Harvey Mandel worked well together,along with Paul lagos and Larry Taylor.If you want to lay back and listen to some fine jazzy blues then this is your album.Please give Fiddler on the rocks a try also.I dont think either will dissapoint."
1,Poorest Quality,This is a staple item that should be easy to have some quality control over however this has proved to not be true from this vendor. These are some of the poorest made items we have ever had to use. The Molex side would not stay together such that it would actually be useful. The pins would all just pop out upon insertion. We went through 30 of these and 100% failed in the same fashion.
3,"It's okay, would like more sturdy construct","it does what it's supposed to. However, I did not like the fact that one of the 4 pin got easily bent when I tried to connect to molex from the power supply. Luckily, I was able to manage it to connect in place, but if I had to take it out and replug it, I'm not sure if it would be able to be used again. For now, as long as I don't have to take it out, it seems to be working."
5,Easy to connect,"While shipping is rather slow (it appeared they took about 5 days before shipping), I found the quality excellent when compared to those adapters that ship withthe SATA drives, the plastic of the plugs were weak and broke easily. Plus theweight of the cable had a tendency to pull the plug out. These plugs are rigidlyconstructed and plug firmly in. Recommend if you are using the cheap adaptersthat shipped with your drive, replace them before a drive suddenly disappearsdue to the power cable coming loose or falling out."
5,Fantastic!!!!,"Once again, the English have shown us what REAL entertainment is all about. They have put out yet another incredibly written, fast-paced really-makes-you-think-to-try-and-keep-up-with-the-pace-and-plot of a series! ""Trinity"", along with ""Being Human"", ""Sherlock"", ""The Murder Room"", ""Agatha Christie's Marple"", and ""New Tricks"", which is another groundbreaker in quality of writing & tight plots, & one could even hark back to the truly greatly entertaining ""Jonathan Creek"" mystery series. Unfortunately however, I cannot find where ""Trinity"" was picked up after Season 1. What a shame!! A great show!!"
5,Absolutely love this series!,"This is a great series, very funny with twists and interesting characters. Definitely recommend and hope there are more seasons to follow."
2,i expected to like it-,"-but i didn't. i've listened to it a number of times, thinking it would grow on me. its super mellow, and had some interesting things going on, but it was missing some vital bit. i just couldn't get into it."
2,Worse than ETK & MAQ,"I felt compelled to enter this review after reading the praise for Dots and Loops. My 1st Stereolab was Emperor Tomato Ketchup - absolutely brilliant. I next bought Dots and Loops - just couldn't get into it. Oh, how I tried - do you people have a sense of melody? Maybe cut 2, but, well, I finally sold it (after AT LEAST 10 listenings). Recently I bought my 3rd Stereolab - an earlier release Mars Audio Quintet - wonderful. it's like hearing Rubber Soul or Revolver before Sgt Pepper (Sgt Pepper being Emp Tom K).My faith in Stereolab is restored - now which one to buy next? But, to anyone reading this - avoid Dots & Loops!!!"
1,Mayonnaise for the Ears,"If my sixty-plus parents were in charge of a recording studio, this is the kind of avant-garde music they might produce. There is absolutely no edge and no hook. Like Enya without melody.Pass on this album."
5,the jumping off point for 21st century LAB,"I felt compelled to write this review after reading the one below. Dots and Loops is a transitional album, much like Mars Audiac Quintet was, coming off the massive breakthrough of Transient Random Noise Bursts. Dots and Loops/Mars Audiac also happen to be my favorite Lab records, simply because they hold their mood all the way through. ETK's first seven tracks are hopping mad with energy, but the last half, while still really great, is a downer. I always have to play one half of the album or the other, hardly ever the whole thing. I look at ETK as two really good EP's. Dots and Loops is a super groovy head trip all the way through. Worth it for ""Refractions in the Plastic Pulse"" alone!"
5,pulp tooth bask nip word,"cool. loungey, melodic, atmospheric, interesting sound and beat combinations.quite 60s sounding, but not cheesily so like Dimitri. like a mix of morcheeba, dimitri and various beats.the lyrics are half english half french, and the lead singer's voice is melt worthy. low, pure, calm. stereolab is like a 60s beatnik sound sparked with something from the future.my favourite track is ""refractions in the plastic pulse"", which is like a theme + variation 17 minute track modulating through music genres, from cool jazz to gurgly pretty electronica, beatnik to ambient mysterious reggae, quiet industrialish electronica to beatnik.casual, cool, lovely."
5,"""Mummy! I can hear the fractals!""","Mere words cannot adequately describe how I treasure this record: wherein every song is a densely and intricately constructed whole unto itself and still the whole far transcends the sum of its coruscating parts. Best to describe my relationship with this record as a collection of associations and fragments: falling in love and a coffee buzz: Diagonals: angular grooves; driving at night: Contronatura: dark, effervescent pulses; holidaying in mountains at Easter: Brakhage and Parsec: shambolic cadences; above all, the company of loved friends."
2,A little too bland for my tastes,"I recently dusted this CD off and gave it a spin, wondering how well it has aged these past 15 or so years.I'm afraid to say it's still as plain as I remembered it. It simply does not move me in any significant way & that is the whole point of being a music fan in my opinion. Finding music that you can connect with & that can move you. Stereolab's earlier louder guitarier dronier songs work their magic on me but this just doesn't.It sounds really clean though, the production is top notch (I bet it would sound incredible on an audiophile's $100,000+ hi-fi system), and Miss Modular is a great track, but the rest doesn't really leave much of an impression even after many listens. But obviously looking at other reviews a lot of people do get it & find it amazing, so it must have something in there I just haven't found yet. If I keep listening maybe I'll find it over the next 15 years."
3,Compelling but not coheisve,"3 1/2Still as hip as the day it was released, Stereolab's smoothly organic electro is in full-fledged experimental swing here, though despite providing another lengthy digital stimulation with many fascinating ideas and consistently great segments, D&L; just feels too scattershot for its own good, coming across as a jumbling spill of innovative audio entertainment."
4,Surprisingly useful!,"My 4 year old daughter found this book very interesting for a few weeks. I didn't like some of the examples it used, but only because they required a lot of explanation. It gave us a good starting point to talk about some manners, but also things like movies and the game of tennis. My daughter had never been to a movie before, so Clifford's advice not to disturb others needed some explanation. And showing a game of tennis to preschoolers seemed odd to me, to suggest playing by the rules!"
3,this was ok,this book was ok i mean if you were a little kid you would like it but it does sorta teach you manners
4,Met Malcolm,"The singularly preeminent post classic autobiography I have read. Malcolm Muggeridge is a endearing soul who's penetrating wit pierces to the heart, many of the convenient illusions that accompany life. The era in which he lived was for many predominated by the dream of collectivism and brotherhood, equality and deliverance from class struggles and from the ugliness of market capitalism. Malcolm's idealism, is slowly smothered and crushed by developments in history that reveal, given our natures ,the impossibility of this dream ever becoming a reality. Malcolm shifts his paradigm from without to within, where the true struggle has always resided, and as he always knew it did. The result of Malcolm's endeavor is worth knowing and I recommended you buy his book and find out for yourself."
4,Lots to chew on...,"This book is what I call ""chewy"" - not one to just breeze through in a day or two as you would a bestseller. There is a lot going on here. I think MM had a manic-depressive disorder, and that comes to light in his other autobiographical book (of his diaries) as well. Interesting to read about hisrocky journey through all the highs and lows, and how he finally finds serenity later in life."
5,"Love, War, Family, and Faith","I have never been a reader of war stories, nor did I know a lot about WWII. However, this book manages to overview the Second Great War and its effect on the U.S., while weaving in a story of love and faith.Bonsall knows his characters well, because it's his parents' story. His writing is simple yet passionate. A quick read - that you will never forget. The book offers inspiration for the times we live in today."
1,"Weak, choppy storytelling ruin a great love story.","As a military wife, I was horribly disappointed with this book. It reads more like a history textbook than a romance story. I was very excited to read it expecting a heart warming story of love torn by war. It was anything but that. It is the choppiest writing style I have read outside of Anthropology 101. It offers a very historical perspective and very little emotional appeal."
5,A REAL LOVE STOREY,"This is a wonderful love storey, written by a loving son. The book held my attention like no other"
5,G.I. Joe & Lillie: Remembering a Life of Love and Loyalty,What a beautiful story. Everyone should read it. It should be required reading in schools. It might give kids an appreciation for this wonderful nation and the freedoms we enjoy.
1,Why I was not completely satisfied,"I have enjoyed Crossword puzzles for many years. Unfortunately I often need help. For assistance I have used ""Webster's Offical Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"" copyright 1981 by Merriam Co. Needless to say I needed an update dictionary. When I saw this book advertized I thought it was just what I needed and ordered it imnmediately. If I had seen a copy of this book first, I would never have ordered it. This book is impossible to read. All info is run together and difficult to dicipher.I do like the fact that this dictionary includes the first names of authors, painters, Nobel prize winners etc. I guess you can't have everything?? I still use my dated dictionary and refer to my new one only when necessary.JoAn Elmore"
2,lots of problems,the i 700 loses data and phone numbers for no apparent reason. i have 3 times put in numbers and then lost them. it is diffiuclt to connect to the internet. it is difficult to hold the phone without pushing one of the the buttons on the side. the biggest positive is that the screen is easy to read.
5,Great complete solution,"I've owned this device for 3 months now and love it. As somebody that is frequently out of the office, it's been great to have my PDA and my phone in one device."
1,"Okay PDA, Non-working phone","The PDA part of the i700 worked fine and synchronization was relatively easy. However, the phone part only worked for about two months. First the speaker quit, then the microphone, and finally the headset part. Since I bought it primarily for the phone, it did not meet my standards for usage. A co-worker experienced similar problems having gone through 3 phones in six months, all due to the phone not working."
2,"Bulky, poorly designed nuisance gadget","I have had this phone now for a couple of years and it is definately a love/hate relationship. LOVE: Phone/PDA/internet browser in one. HATE: User interface, buttons that stick out causing them to be pressed inadvertantly (I will be walking along and hear dialtones or my wife saying ""hello? hello?"" because the dial button has been bumped in my pocket), and embarassingly large size. I paid $800 a few years ago and I am GLAD it's cheaper now. I look forward to when it dies so I can get a smaller phone."
3,Annoying peice of,"My LCD screen cracked. I think this was due to taking it from the cold Chicago winter to the warm inside. Or maybe I dropped it. Either way, you can imagine how fragile this giant screen is. Now, it looks pretty sweet. But in reality, combined with the very very poor product called Microsoft Pocket PC, it couldn't be more annoying. The thing is constantly waking up as it's in my pocket, and then random buttons are pushed, causing all manner of idiocy, including calling people without my knowledge and adding appointments with reminders that wake me up. And now that my screen is cracked I can't turn off the reminders. I can only press ""snooze"" so every 5 minutes the reminder comes back, buzzing and dinging. I think they made mine out of stupid. And this is the best phone Verizon makes? Incredible.Edit: I meant to rate this as 2 stars."
5,a book which separates fiction from fact,"Jay Gould is remembered as the worst of the 19th century ""Robber Barons"" - a destroyer of companies - yet as Maury Klein so ably details, this reputation was almost wholly fabricated by the media and bears little resemblance to a man obsessed with building a transportation and communications empire. Klein's book is more than about Jay Gould, it's about the vast gulf separating all-too-common media generated myths and the truth."
2,The Life and Legend of Jay Gould,"This book was very long and had very little information about the life of Jay Gould. It is very well researched. If you want to know the details of every railroad Gould bought, it is a blockbuster. If you want to know about what his life was like and who he married and where he lived, this book will not please you. There is very little personal information."
3,Good for the financial beginner.,"If you're not hip on financial stuff, this is not a bad book to start with. If you're like me, however, and you regularly read Kiplinger's Personal Finance, Money or the business section of the paper, you don't need it. It seems like the author took all the sound advice that was printed in the last five years, heck, the last year, and consolidated it, not that there's anything wrong with that. But if you've already read it in magazines and newspapers, it's a waste of money. I would recommend the financial books by Eric Tyson in the For Dummies series before this one. Aside from the financial advice, the author finds it necessary to constantly give his resume and cite his expertise. A little too self-promoting. The list of his credentials on the back flap was enough."
5,25 Myths You've Got to Avoid....,Product arrived well within specified time estimate.Item described accurately.Well-packaged.I would recommend this seller.
2,Search for battery-operated lights misguided me,"I did a search for battery operated lights, and this product showed up in the search, and I purchased it. I should have researched it a little harder, but I feel that I was misguided. These are NOT battery operated!"
5,Dean Nuclear Green Bass looks and plays well,"This Dean Bass is very worth more than the price. Looks and sounds amazing. I may purchase another color in the future. If you are a starter this is in your budget. I played Bauhaus ""Bela Lugosi Is Dead"" right off... very amazing sound. You cannot go wrong with a Dean."
4,Zyliss is a great scoop!,"I love this scoop! It is strong, and easy to use. What more could you want in an ice cream scooper??"
4,Great bottle some limitations,"Pros:1. My son took to these bottles immediately, no nipple confusion between breasfeeding and bottle feeding.2. Easy and convenient way to feed since there is little clean up needed.3. Absolutely no bubbles in the formula when feeding and therefore no gas issues.Cons:1. There is the constant expense of purchasing liners, however you can find affordable comparable liners at your supercenter stores.2. You can't trust the measurement on the liner so you need to measure your formula in another utensil. (Kind of negates the fact that there is less clean up with this bottle).3. The 4oz and 8oz liners actually hold a little more than 3oz and 6oz respectively."
5,Baby Lover,I love these bottles. I tried using Avent and the Playtex vetn-air and neither of them prevented my daughter from getting air like these. I especially like them because they are so easy to clean! For any expectant mother these are a must have.
2,Alright... but...,"At first I really liked these, until I realized that my baby just used about 100 liners in about 1 week. It's not easy to squeeze the air out. Since I keep track of how much our baby eats, how can I do that when the liner is all scrunched up! Not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out. I'm sorry I ever bought them."
3,So good in the beginning!,"I loved these bottles when my daughter was a newborn, they're super convenient and easy to keep clean. The nipples are a perfect shape to help your baby maintain the correct latch when switching between bottle and breast. The problem came about as my daughter got older: the 8 oz liners don't hold 8 oz of water and the appropriate amount of powdered formula. If you don't use ready-to-feed formula or a liquid concentrate, or if you don't want to make all of your formula in a separate container and transfer it in when it's feeding time, these may not be the bottles for you. When I contacted customer service about it I was told that I should ""mix in a seperate container and then add the leftovers in after my baby clears some space."" This from a woman who's obviously never tried to take a bottle from a hungry baby."
4,Great bottles,I couldnt nurse for very long but I kept using these bottles. My baby never had gas and didnt spit up at all. The drop in liners were really convenient but can get costly. I must have gotten some faulty liners because they kept leaking. Everytime my son would tip the bottle up the formula would pour down his front and soak him. I got so frusterated I quit using them all together. Besides that I reccomend them for convienence.
3,"Not a very realistic ""just like mom"" nipple","My baby hated the nipple that comes with this set. I'm breastfeeding, but have to use a bottle sometimes too. This nipple isn't anything like my breast nipple. I liked the system, although it's very costly, buying the liners or drop-ins. I use the Nuk pacifier, and they make a Nuk nipple that fits on this nurser (cheaper than the one Playtex makes) and my baby will take it now. Nuk is more like the shape your nipple takes when baby is suckling. Playtex really thinks highly of their stuff. If your baby doesn't like any of the (few)nipples that fit this nurser, you're out big bucks."
1,Be Careful,"While washing the nurser, I cut my forefinger (like an annoying paper cut) on bottom edge of the bottle. I am glad I realized it has a rough edge before my 6 month old cut her fingers!"
2,Poor Quality Control,"We bought the starter set. While the product is OK, three of the nipples where not pierced and no milk was flowing. The baby was crying and crying but not drinking. As new parents, we had time to worry before we realized what was happening. I tried to call customer service to ask for a replacement but they don't operate on week-ends so I never called. Anyway if this the level of quality control to be expect at Playtex, I would rather not entrust my baby to their products. We switched to Dr. Brown products and are quite happy."
1,Dangerous bottles - be careful!,"I thought I ""had to have"" the bottles that had the slider on the side to slide the bag up and air out..well..those sliders don't slide the bag evenly, they actually get stuck and are totally useless. More importantly - the tops of the bottles shread and break off leaving little pieces of sharp hard plastic on the top of the bottle. It almost looks and feels like glass - very dangerous! (happened on 6 out of 8 bottles that I have) However, I also use other playtex drop-in bottles (the old fashion looking ones) the plasctic is NOT like glass and they are wonderful! Go with what is safe and what works rather than appearance, I didn't at first and regret it :)"
3,Buy only 1 to try on baby first - not the best for REFLUX!,We got this as a shower gift. At first it worked really well with our son but soon we discovered that he had a minor case of Reflux. This does the job of cutting down on the air but it's hard to get all the formula into the nipple toward the end - so he did get some air. The nipple is nothing like the breast like it says that it is - it was too big for our son's mouth. It was easier to clean since all you have to do is remove the liner. But buying the liners all the time can get costly. I would seriously recommend get the Playtex Ventaire's because it cuts down on the air alot more and the bottles are angled to as much formula into the nipple as possible and the nipples are much easier for baby to suck on (make sure you get stage 1 for newborns and stage 2 for older babies).
3,"Love the Nurser, prefer EASY FEEDER","I love the Playtex bottles, but I strongly recommend buying the new Easy Feeder. The Easy Feeder has a burper which is my only complaint about the original and premium playtex nursers. Prior to feeding the bag or drop-in has to be burped which is easily done by pushing it up until milk comes out of the nipple. The problem is while feeding, if you have to stop and set the bottle down, air goes back in and needs to be re-burped. It is very dificult to burp when there is less milk. Your hand can not fit into the bottle high enough. Some people use a spoon to push it up, but who wants to carry around a spoon too and use two hands. With the Easy Feeder, each time you just slide it up (with one hand after some practice)...much easier and faster when your baby is hungry."
4,Better than Avent for breastfed babies!,"I initially purchased [another] set for my 2-month-old exclusively breast-fed baby, based on the ... advertising claiming these were ""Most like Mom"". HA! Unless you have Farrah Fawcett nipples, they [were] not at all like Mom - much too long and hard to please a baby used to something smaller and softer. [Then I] tried the Playtex Premium Nursers. Bingo! These silicone nipples are much more realistic and soft (make sure they are the Premium). Also, the wide nipple base helps maintain good latch-on habit. You can also buy these ""Natural Shape"" nipples separately if you already have any of the Playtex bottles - they are mix & match! Finally - successful switchover! I subtracted 1 star due to the fact that this set only comes with non-environmentally friendly disposable liner type bottles (which can't be used with bottle warmers, either)."
5,THE best choice for bottle feeding,"Not only do the Playtex Drop-Ins system make your new-mom life sooo much easier (easy to use and especially with your one free hand, easy clean up-no need to spend hours sterilizing bottles), they also alleviate the possibility of baby taking in too much gas/air like regular bottles do (which is very important as most newborns tend to be fussy from gas), and they are FREE OF BISPHENOL A, which is a polycarbonate that leaches out of plastic when heated. Most major bottle manufacturers use plastic that contain bisphenol a.Though people say the Drop Ins system is pricey- it's well worth it for baby's safety and health, and your precious time as a new mom.This is by far the ONLY thing that I recommend to new moms."
5,4 time mom-awesome bottle,"All I can say is if this bottle doesn't work for you, than maybe what you are feeding the baby isn't the best for them, or maybe no matter what system you use, the baby has tummy problems. I have used this system among other samples of other types of bottles thru all 3 of my children. THEY ARE THE BEST, especially for those moms who will be breastfeeding and bottle feeding. I have never, ever had a problem and have used both breast milk and formula in these bottles. I am due for my fourth in August and have no other plans but to use Playtex. Love that I can push the air out and the clean-up is wonderful. I also love that mom can express milk right into the bag to be used for the baby, wonderful system, highly recommended. And they are also not as expensive as some of those other &amp;quot;fancy&amp;quot; systems, which is an added plus!"
4,Great for a new parent,"We intended to breast feed exclusively, so we didn't give much thought to bottles except to register for this set based on the Amazon reviews. Within the first week, our daughter needed to be bottle-fed formula for weight gain problems and jaundice. I opened up this set and it had everything I hadn't known I needed. My daughter loved it, and also didn't have any problem later getting back on the breast.The one problem with this is that it uses disposable inserts. While this saves time on cleaning, it is a waste of plastic, not to mention an ongoing expense. With a microwave steam sterilizer, sterilizing is not much of a chore, and I would not mind doing more frequently to save on the plastic.The advent bottles do not use plastic inserts, however, the Playtex nipples are far superior. The slowest Advent nipples have a far faster flow than the Playtex. Perhaps, when my daughter is older and takes a faster flow, I will think about switching."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"MY SON HAS USED THE PLAYTEX NURSERS SINCE HE WAS BORN. WE RECEIVED TWO GIFT-SETS AT OUR SHOWER, BOTH OF WHICH THE PAINT CHIPPED OFF OF WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, LEAVING US TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE LIQUID MARKINGS ON THE DROP-INS . NOT ONLY ARE THE DROP-IN LINERS INSANELY EXPENSIVE, WE HAVE ALSO HAD TO ENDURE THE COST OF PURCHASING MULTIPLE REPLACEMENT SETS. WE HAVE HAD BETTER LUCK WOTH THE DECORATED NURSERS, AS THESES BOTTLES ARE MORE OF AN ACRYLIC MATERIAL THAN SOFT PLASTIC. HOWEVER, THE DECORATED NURSER IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE PLAIN DROP-IN BOTTLES. MY SON HAD A TERRIBLE TIME WITH GAS AND DIGESTIVE ISSUES THROUGH-OUT THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF HIS LIFE, AND WOULD NOT ADAPT TO ANY OTHER BOTTLE, UNFORTUNITLY. UNLESS I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE, I WOULD NEVER CHOOSE THIS LINE OF BOTTLES AGIAN."
1,Playtex bottles are no good for powder formula users,"When my son started to drink 8 oz of formula I found that I could not mix 8 oz of water with the powdered formula directly in the bottle. There is not enough room to add the formula. I had to mix in a separate container and then add it and even then it still didn't fit. When I burped him the first time I would add the rest of the formula to the bottle. I am now switching to a regular bottle - I noticed all the regular bottles are 9 oz which leaves plenty of room for both 8 oz of water and powdered formula. And, on top of that, I'm glad I don't have to spend the $16 a month on the liners. Yes, I have to clean the bottles now, but I always had to clean them anyway."
4,not good for formula,i bought these bottle for my frist child and only used them for the frist 2-3 months becuase at 3 months my son was drinking 6-8 onces of formula at each feeding. like somebody else said you cant mix more then about 6 onces of formula in these bottles at a time. so these bottles were a waste of money in my book 2-3 months is not worth the price you pay for these bottles. i wish i would have stuck to the advent bottles i had thought about getting at frist.
2,Only one good feature,"These bottles are great as far as not having to clean them all the time because of the liners, but that is about the only pro I found. When you are trying to squeeze the air out (which takes what seems like forever when you have a screaming baby anyway), sometimes they bust and you have to start all over...not to mention a waste of expensive formula or breastmilk. Second, once your baby is down to a couple of ounces left in the bottle, it is impossible to reach your fingers up in there to get any air out. Third, there is no way to heat these bottles in the car. I have a Munchkin car bottle warmer but it doesn't work on these bottles because of the liners. The milk does not actually touch the bottle so there is no way to heat it. Not very convenient for long or short road trips. I switched to AVENT and my baby is like a different baby. I didn't realize that he was unhappy with these bottles until I changed, but I see a big difference now."
5,Great for Tummy Problems,"I had tried NUMEROUS other bottles with my daughter who had pyloric stenosis when she was born. (The valve/muscle between her stomach and small intestine closed off and hardened.) We discovered with using these bottles and mixing up her formula beforehand in a pitcher are the only things that keep her from spitting up all the time. My nephew uses the same bottles and it helps greatly with his reflux. You would never realize there could be an improvement on gas and spit up unless you try these bottles. The drop-ins are an addition expense but well worth it in my mind. I just buy them is a large quantity from Toys R Us or Babies R Us when they're on sale, which is quite frequent."
5,great for breastfeeding mothers and babies,"What I love about the premium nurser starter set is that it comes with accessories so I can use the bottle system directly with my breastpump. With the adapter kit, I can pump straight into the drop-in liners, which is convenient. The kit only has enough pieces to store two full liners without using the bottles/holders, so I checked the Playtex website to see if I could buy another one. Turns out, you can call for replacement parts; when I did, they sent me another kit for free. I like having more of the pieces so I can take advantage of using the liners for pumping and storing milk. My daughter took the bottle easily the first time and ever since. We used the regular nipples with my first daughter, and she never had a problem with that either. Neither girl has had trouble with nipple confusion using these bottles. Definitely worth a try for breastfeeding mothers!"
5,The best nipples,These are the best nipples yet and satisfied my strictly breastmilk daughter for one year while I worked. I tried avent and was very dissatisfied at how stiff the silicone is and the shape was not nearly as close to breast as playtex.
5,TRI CUT RULES!,"From my experience the tri cut nipples for this bottle system is the best thing ever created. When my daughter was about 5 months she started holding her bottle. The problem was when she doesn't want to drink anymore she would just toss it aside and so much milk would leak and i'd have to change her whole crib out. The tri cut nipples only lets milk out when it's being sucked out so even when she tosses her bottles around, not a drop of milk would leak. It saved me time from washing and rewashing her sheets, saved me time from bathing her becase she'd get milk all over her clothes (it's amazing how it's so fascinating to them that when you turn a bottle upside down....it drip drip drips)...thank you playtex"
3,not for breastfeeding,"My husband and I looked at a number of different bottles. We decided on using these mostly because of the dropins, we thought that they would be excellent. However, after attending our breastfeeding class we found out that the liners absorb most of the nutrients and research shows that bottles without the liners are the best. So we will be switching over to ventair."
2,not the best for premies,My son was only a week or two early and the only noticable difference was a weak suck. For the first few weeks I had to pump and then give Max a bottle until he could learn how it all worked. I bought these bottles as a cheaper alternative to the Avent bottles recomended by my lactation consultant. Trying to push and keep the air out is rediculous. You spend too much time doing this and your child will be hysterical. He still is unable to completely drain the bottle and his suck is back on track according to the pediatrician. If you are feeding your child breast milk... aka liquid gold... you don't want to waste one drop. My son did not like the nipples at all... they are suppose to be designed to be the most like breast... I've checked with friends and we know no one with nipples like these. We finally bought Avent bottles and he loves them and had no confussion from breast to bottle and back again. It's worth the extra buck or two for the better bottles.
3,"Okay, but sometimes annoying.","I originally bought the four ounce versions, and quikly found out that pushing the liner up was difficult after a burbing. When my baby started taking more than 4 oz, I switched to the Easy Feeder bottles, also from Playtex. These have a a slider that pushes the air out and is pretty easy to use. I tried all the nipples, but found the silicon ones the best for my baby. You can also buy store brand liners at a much reduced priced. I have found these to be just as good as the Playtex ones. In short I love the disposable ystemut would recommend the Easy Feeder bottles. As for traveling with your bottles, use a cooler a bag and an ice pack."
3,Good bottles,"When my baby boy was born, I wanted to bottle-feed. My husband said I should breast-feed. I did breast-feeding for about two weeks, until my baby was circumcised, then I switched to bottles because I had to return to work a month later. The first bottels I tried were not very good. My son would swallow air and develop a case of gas. When I used these bottles, I discovered that they minimize air swallowing. They work. Except after three months of age, my baby became overweight (42 lbs, 28 inches). These bottles rock."
5,BEST BOTTLES,"These are the best bottles ever!!!!! Even though I primarily breastfed, I had to pump and use bottles due to me having surgery. I experimented with all brands and these were the best. The silicone nipples are nicely shaped for babies sucking, they are easy to clean, and they are so easy to heat up. Just a few seconds in a glass of warm water and whala. I highly recommend these bottles for formula and breastfed babies."
5,Playtex Premium Bottles work best!!,"I started using the Playtex regular bottles which worked great. Like people have complained, you can't get 8 ounces in the drop-in liners, so I switched to Avent. They worked alright, although my daughter was still a little gassy. I tried the Playtex Premium with the silicon nipple and loved them. The Playtex silicon nipples are so much softer than the Avent nipples and she latches on to make a tight suction. I have often forgot to ""burp"" the liners, but they still collapse soshe has hardly gets any gas! They work just like the breast."
5,the best ever !,"I have tried all different kinds of bottles including the playtex originals, after having 6 children. And I have had different challenges from them all, even the high priced ones. I have never had a bottle that I have enjoyed to use or that have worked so well as the playtex premium. I loved these, I guess the best was saved for the last baby!!"
4,I love these bottles!,"I love these bottles. My son is now 2 weeks old and he has latched on the nipples so easily. They are easy to use. I can make a bottle and hold my baby at the same time. I also don't have a problem with bubbles either, unlike some bottles. I recommend these bottles to formula feeding mothers."
2,I had problems with this bottle,"I started out using these bottles, and had problems when my son would suck for an hour on the slow flow nipple. We went to buy medium flow nipples, and Playtex's medium flow nipples are the wrong shape/texture! For some reason, Playtex doesn't make medium flow nipples in the same shape as their silicone. My son was gulping air, which caused excessive gas/spitting up. He couldn't figure out the new nipple. I did like the drop-in liners, but when I ran out of the ones I received at my shower, I found them to be too expensive. It's twice as much for the drop-in kind than the regular flat ones. And the flat ones are impossible to put in the bottle while holding baby. I also found them to occasionally ""split"" when attaching, also hard to figure out how much to fill. Do you follow the ounces on bottle or liner?? So in the end, mostly because of nipple issues, I switched to Avent and haven't had any problems."
2,"Okay, but not as great as people say","I bought these bottles because of convinence. My friend had told me how she loved these kind of bottles. At first they were okay, but I have had trouble with the drop in liners coming loose while feeding my daughter, getting her soaked in formula. Also they are hard to measure because the liner draws in as they suck and if you burp the bottle you can not tell without having to open and shake the bottle around. The liners gets rather expensive, it would be worth the money if they weren't so aggravating."
5,best bottle,I tried 3 different bottles before trying this one. I wish I tried this one first. I heard such great things about the Advent bottles but my son did not like it. He took to this bottle right away. I was so happy to find a bottle he liked. The bottle is easy to use and easy to clean. I love it.
4,you never are done paying for them.....,"We received this starter set, plus a bunch of extra 4 ounce bottles. We love them but I'm tired of buying refill dropins. I wish I would have registered for the gerber bottles. I still stick these bottles in the dishwasher anyway so I would not need disposable liners if I had selected real bottles.I took the fast flow nippes back. Our son still likes the slow flow (5 months old)."
3,Playtex works for us! Look for set with more variety.,"Finally a system that works for us. I love Playtex and the Drop Ins are very convienient and easy to use. However, I would caution against investing in an entire Starter Set before you know which nipples work best for you. The problem with this Premium Nurser set is that it only has the silicone nipples, when to me, the best selling point of Playtex is the variety of nipples (different shapes in both silicone and latex) that they offer. I was able to find another Playtex set at the grocery store that had a wider variety of products within it."
5,PERFECT,"I have been using these bottles with my son that is now 1. I am having another child and plan on using them again. It's so much easier to just throw the bag away instead of scrubbing the inside of a bottle with a bottle brush. There was one person who said that you can push all the air out (which is what I do), but when you set the bottle back down the air fills back up. I just set the bottles down on their side and no air gets back in. You just start where you left off. I highly recommend these bottles."
1,I hated them and so did my baby,"I thought these bottles were going to be great. They were a pain. You're supposed to squeeze the air out of them so the baby will have less gas. It is very hard to get your hand in the end of the bottle to do that, and once the air is finally out it comes rushing back in once you let go. My baby was the worst at spitting up, she would bring the whole bottle back up. I finally found the MAM Ultivent bottle (they're only found on www.babywise.com --a great site!) It is terrific, and so easy to clean. It totally comes apart. And it really works, after 9 months of constantly wearing a huge bib, we got the MAM bottles and you can finally see her outfits!"
4,Timesaver for pumping moms!,"I decided to switch to Playtex Premium for my 2nd baby(I used regular playtex last time) because I liked the clear silicone nipples that are closer to the breast shape. Little did I know how AWESOME this kit would be!! The most impressive part to me was the breast pump adapter - I can pump directly into the bottle liner with or without the bottle!! I gave the kit 4 stars because it only comes with one breast pump adapter. I haven't found where I could buy just the adapter, so I'll be buying another kit since I have a double pump. My baby latched right on to the nipple and her mouth looks just like it does when she is nursing - very pleasing to me."
4,driving over lemons,I enjoyed the relaxed and contented way this book was written. It was truthful and realistic in its descriptions. I enjoyed gtting to know the family and their adventures and how they are coping with their new lifestyle.
4,Good,"This a wonderfully humorous book about moving to Spain. Ex-rock drummer Chris Stewart and his wife decide to buy a farm in Andalucia. Be with them through all the trials and tribulations of living in a foreign land and being told all sorts of weird and wonderful stories, none of which are true. The book has a great cast of characters, both animal and human, and will teach you many things, most of which you didn't want to know anyway (including what to do when a dead sheep appears in your garden).This book won't give you many belly-laughs but it will keep you smiling for a long time."
5,Hilarious and uplifting,"There are good books, funny books, entertaining books, educational books ... and this book has it all. Written very clever and witty, full of these tiny bits of life experiences, human quirks and wisdoms. Feeling down? Start reading this book and you feel better in a few hours. Modern life can be so complex, so agrivating, so unnatural and depressing. After reading this book you realize how simple and how much fun life can be."
4,Sweet with a few drops of lemon...,"This book truly captures some of the essence of Spanish culture, especially in Andalucia. However, if you are looking for a book with a plot, this does not contain it. It reads more like a journal, each chapter sharing some part of Chris and family's life. A great bed-time reader, give it a chapter or two a night and its a quick read."
5,... makes tasty lemonade.,"Stewart is self-deprecating (but not sappily so) and self-aware (but not over-ironic, which is a treat by itself in this post-Seinfeld age) as he takes himself and his family into a delightful exploration of life in southern Spain by his not-entirely-planned purchase of a farm so remote that there is no electricity, running water, or roads. The story of how he civilizes (and is civilized by the experience) is one of the best short reads I've had this year."
3,O.K.,It was a good description of the rural areas of Spain but did not entertain as much as I thought it would.
4,entertaining,full of what life s really like when you want to give the comfortable life away and start agian. not always going to plan
3,"Quirky, disjointed but agreeable","I found this to be a rather odd book, reading like a series of snapshots of the author's life in rural Andalusia. Stewart spends many pages at the beginning of the book recounting a lot of disagreeable time spent with the man who sold him his Spanish homestead in the province of Granada. It isn't until he has cleared this particular barrier that the story got more interesting for me.There is some good writing in this journal about living off the land in a country not your own, but the same story has been told countless times by others. (What is it about the English that sends them off to the Continent to live rough so often?) Not sure that there are many revelations here that would drive you to buy this book. Still, it is pleasant reading in many of its parts and if you are interested in things Spanish, this might be a good read for you."
2,With optimists like these...,"No kidding, the subtitle of this book ought to be, ""An Idiot in Spain."" Not since King Lear has a book opened with a less comprehensible real estate decision, but - how do I say this? - Chris Stewart is no Shakespeare. It's vaguely fun reading about life in rural southern Spain, but these characters are too cliched and situations too contrived to make this delicious travel writing."
2,Pretty much a lemon,"Am I the only person that was bored to tears by Driving over Lemons? I found this to be a mind-numbing yawn in which sheep-shearer Stewart uproots his family to southern Spain, fixes up his wreck of a farm (irrigation problems, etc.), meets his not particularly interesting neighbors and struggles to adapt to the local ways. Sound familiar? Well Peter Mayle started the trend and is still the gold standard... and Chris Stewart just can't measure up to Mayle in terms of wit, charm or humour. Sure the writing style has the sort of easy flow that one would expect and the fact that Stewart is there for the long haul- striving to re-establish himself as a sheep shearer- represents a new twist and seems to appeal to people (the glowing reviews on Amazon led me to buy this in the first place). But reading Driving over Lemons made me realize that not every move to southern Europe deserves a book or an audience. Strictly for fans of the ""expat-lifestyle"" genre."
3,A Fun Read ...but better without the last chapter,I enjoyed reading this account of life in Spain....all the way thru the second to the last chapter.The last chapter - after the baptism of his daughter - didn't add-up to much.
4,A look inside Spain.,This book was recommended by others also learning Spanish in order to develop our Spanish cultural awareness. It did not disappoint. I now feel as if I have lived in The Alpujarras in Spain. After reading this book I started the second book in the series 'A parrot in the pepper tree' straight away to find out what happened next. Such books take you out of the mundane daily life into a different world. I would encourage you to read this if you also wish to visit this wonderful place.
2,Really quite boring,"I read this book about 1 year after i visited the same town that is depicted in this book. I stayed in a small house outside of town with a lemon orchard and olive trees that had been bought and was in the process of being fixed up by an English couple. So, i was excited when i saw this book. I expected to read wonderful descriptions of the surrounding mountains and the town... unfortunately, the couple in the story have such uninteresting observations about their surroundings, it made the entire book quite bland. I wish i hadn't read it, so that my own vibrant memories of that place could have remained untainted."
2,Doesn't live up to all the hype,"The rave reviews this book received made me expect a much more humourous and interesting story. The author and his wife were like strangers..both to each other and to the reader..no emotion or warmth exhuded from the pages. The many locals they came into contact with were well depicted but the author gave you no insight into how they might have impacted his life and times...they all seemed to be stand-a-lone characters. In contrast, Tony Hawks' ""playing football with the Moldovans"" and ""around Ireland with a fridge"" made both the countries and the characters come alive."
2,not that great...,"I must say that I wasn't intrigued by this story, but it came recommended by a friend. I didn't think I would even finish it, but kept reading in the hopes that there would be an interesting twist or good climax. There wasn't. The author seemed likable and was at times witty, his characters were real, hard-working people, and I related well to his wife. It just wasn't that great of a read."
2,Not Provence or Tuscany either,"I opened this book with great anticipation because of my previous happy trips to Provence with Peter Mayle and Tuscany with Frances Mayes. Though Stewart's reporting of his experience as an ex-pat living on a rustic farm in Spain is serviceable and may be useful to someone planning a comparable adventure, the book never achieves the transporting quality of the best of this genre. When I closed it (half-way through), I missed enjoying that delicious sense of having made a trip to a new place without leaving my own armchair."
5,Southern Cooking for the New Century,"Delightful, delicious and easy to prepare recipes for today's busy lifestyle. Apron Stings has over 300 recipes ranging from old southern favorites to the newest trends. It is beautifully illustrated with full-color photography and includes charming anecdotes which evoke the spirit of Southern cooking. A must have for your cooking library!"
5,Great Addition to Garage Band,"Just setup the M-Audio iControl for Garageband. Setup was a simple plug into a USB port and the board immediately came to life when I started up Garage Band. Using this mixer I find to be very easy and straightforward, and the manual explains everything in very simple concise terms. If you do a lot of tweaking, this board will get you to the settings and parameters that would normally take several keystrokes to get to. The board is nicely sized, and can sit on your desktop and not take up precious space. All in all, this mixing board is nicely equipped, easy to setup and feature rich. I highly recommend it."
2,Review,It is certainly totally different from the paper version and looks just like any other electronic dictionary. I found it useful but the interface is quite elementary and could be much better for that price.
3,I love the genre,"I have been wanting to see this for a while. Missed it in the theatres. I have seen other earlier versions and love war genre espeically WWII. When I watch movies like these I don't put much emphesis on the effects. I like a good storyline, good acting is a must and the importance of the film. I thought this had all three plus Tom Cruise who did not disappoint as usual. But I would not want to see it twice. So I gave it a 3."
4,A true story,Not much for thrilling action but what pulls this movie through is the true story of the brave people giving their lives to stop the Nazi's and their crimes against humanity.
3,Zwei Thumbs Up,"Brannagh, Wilkinson, Stamp...Cruise? Yes, Mr. Cruise joins these incredible actors in a gripping, and mostly accurate, picture about a failed assassination attempt on AH. Cruise is at best a mediocre actor who shines brighter when he is not the focus of attention (like ""Magnolia"" and even ""Tropic Thunder""), but despite this, the film is worth seeing, and it's surprising that it was ripped apart before it hit theaters. Peeps need to lighten up on the TC-bashing and actually see his movies before they review them so harshly."
3,solid historical WW II drama about attempt to kill Hitler.,"first, this is a dramatic film, not a action film. It takes place during WW II, and there are some (but not many) battle / action scenes. It was even more interesting when you realize the movie was based on true historical facts.Cruise plays a military officer who forms a group of generals / politicans intent on killing Hitler, for the good of Germany. They realize that Germany has become a dictatorship, and want a return to a representative government. They have a ""plan"" to do so, and plot involves them carrying out that plan.Good supporting acting from Kenneth Branaugh and Terrence Stamp add dramatic intensity and weight to the film. The actor who plays Hitler also does a fine job."
3,We have to show the world that not all of us are like him,"I did not know what to expect coming into this film, as I am not a huge fan of Tom Cruise. Despite the film's promotion based largely on his name attachment, I wanted to see how the writers handled the film's content. As it was, Cruise's performance was well done, and a rather demure character Stauffenberg was, considering most of Cruise's action-packed past roles. I don't know how historically accurate the film was, but it succeeded in conveying that many who were in ranks with Hitler did not support his tactics. Consequently, it also candidly revealed the punishment for rebelling. In short, it is a film worth seeing with intense moments of high drama and Cruise's signature ego-driven hero performance in the end."
3,"""Valkyrie"" Averts Cinematic Disaster","Once you get past the strange mixture of British and American accents, ""Valkyrie"" emerges as a no-nonsense thriller directed with striking flair by Bryan Singer. Despite some post-production tinkering (which explains the truncated roles of Kenneth Branagh and Eddie Izzard), the film meticulously chronicles the July 1944 assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler and its inevitable denouement. Surrounded by a fine international cast, Tom Cruise gives a better-than-adequate performance as mastermind Claus von Stauffenberg. ""Valkyrie"" succeeds in overcoming the ""Cruise's Gate"" stigma as evidenced by the ludicrous teaser trailer."
2,HO-HUM -m-m-m-m-,"This is a good movie for history buffs. It comes off as more of a documentary than an actual movie. I'm glad I saw it once, as it was informative, but will not watch it again. One thing is for sure, it doesn't deserve all the hype it received."
2,Stilted Drama on Attempt to Kill Hitler,"""Valkyrie"" is a movie made for Tom Cruise fans. It never takes off, and has a very slow pace. Cruise plays the lead as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, famous for trying to assassinate Hitler and bring WWII to a quick end. However hard Cruise tries, he just does not grab the viewer as the character. It is Tom Cruise dressed up in period costumes and just saying his lines. The scenes look authentic but Cruise does not.""Valkyrie"" is the name of Hitler's strategic emergency plan that a group of high ranking Germans use as part of their plot to assassinate the evil dictator and take over the Nazi government from inside. The future of the world is at stake, and so is Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's wife and children.It is based on a true story, but there does not seem to be enough material for a full-length movie."
4,Not too bad - entertaining,"excellent movie...keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way. Wish there were more actual fighting/gun battles, but excellent acting by all those involved as the tension is very high with each scene....bluray edition is excellent quality and picture perfect clarity as usual for a bluray."
4,On doing the right thing,"I won't go into details about this fine film. That has already been done at length.I wanted to see this in the theater, and it never worked out, and I never bothered to get it until after I watched a documentary about the attempts to assassinate Hitler.What struck me about the film was the nobility shown by the men who tried to save the honor of their country before it was too late. If the war had gone better, would they still have had the same compulsion? In any case it is a very well made movie, very well acted, that was not as entertaining as it was educational, but one I liked quite a bit.3 *"
3,German Christians killed 6 Million Jews,"Hitler was given moral support from the Church, Both, The Catholics and the Protestants. This is a fact.'Millions of German Christians who were Hitlers Willing executioners were church going Christians.However, in this movie, they tried to portray this Col as a ""Good Christian"" trying to rewrite history.This is a good movie but for that propaganda."
4,Good historical movie.,"The movie depicts realistically the facts of July 20th 1944, except for the way in which general Beeck died."
3,A Pretty Good Movie Underneath All That Tom Cruise Frosting,"Its a shame that Cruise's lifestyle overshadows the important message of the film Valkyrie. For some reason, this is a little known story of WWII, about how a few people in the German army tried to do away with Hitler.Most people know nothing about this story (as well as not knowing who lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue - sheesh) and I'm kind of glad this movie was made. Technically, the film is very good: the sets, props and the acting. Resisting evil at all costs, even if the odds are against you, is something people need to learn today."
2,Movie is OK but......,"I bought this, but recommend others saver their money.If you absolutally must have this movie, buy the standard version and save yourself $11.00.I bought this and once again DRM raises it's paranoid head.Can't get the ""Digital Copy"" Disk to play on my PC, due to the DRM code being invalid and when I contacted Fox to get assistance they just warned me about the illegality of DRM stripping but offered no help on getting the video transferred.The movie is good but don't count on the ""digital copy"" being Simple, Fast, or Portable"" as it is none of the above."
3,INTERESTING STORY MURKILY PLAYED,"""Valkerie' covers some of the plots to assassinate Hitler when things were'nt going so good for the Germans. None was successful, but the suspense adds to the plot. Many of the Cast are excellent but Tom Cruise, as usual, is the weak link. Conveniently photographed with lifts in his shoes and with head shots to disguise his diminiutive size, Mr Cruise hams it up with an eye patch and lots of earnest overacting."
4,Valkyre,I was familiar with the events depicted in this movie. Seeing it brought to the big screen was great. I thought the pace of the movie was good and historically they were pretty close. All of the actors fit their characters well. I liked it and anyone that is a WW2 history buff should enjoy it as well.
4,Go see DOWNFALL for a true piece of WWII film art,This was better than many critics made it out to be.It would be good viewing for younger people who are weak on their WW2 and Hitler history to learn the basics of this historical event.I must agree with those who say Cruise was outclassed by the actors who surrounded him. He may also be at the disadvantage of being an American trying to play the part of the principal German character in the movie while many of the other actors were infact European or even German.All thngs considered it was worth watching once but not something I would ass to my DVD collection.On the other hand DOWNFALL is the absolute best film ever made covering the end of Hitler's reign and WW2.DOWNFALL is so good you forget you are watching a movie at times.
4,Amazon Service & Product Quality,"I am a loyal customer a Amazon.com, I am very glad to mention to all of the global customer that i am very much impressed with the picture quality, product quality, and the awesome service provided by the amazon globally, i truly recommend to all the global customer to take the advantage of the amazon."
3,History and it's aftermath,"A chapter of WWII I heard about decades ago and now seems everyone is aware of it -- shows how damned little of history most people know. Let's be real, there was very little noble in the plot. They just didn't want Hitler to drag them all in Hell with him. Many thousands of regular German Army soldiers (the Wehrmacht) were convicted after the war of war crimes. Most Germans regarded the conspirators as traitors. Knew a guy who dad actually fought in the Wehrmacht and this (former) friend of said, ""Hitler went a little too far."" Unfortunately, that would be the opinion of the overwhelming number of Germans of that generation. Not a bad film.Spoiler *** Hitler survives."
5,"Excellent movie, don't listen to the critics",This movie stays almost perfectly true to the actual historical events. I thought Tom Cruise did an excellent job and the movie was well cast overall. If your a WWII buff like I am you will enjoy this movie.
2,So historically inaccurate unbelievable!,"Not sure why Tom wanted to shoot in Germany...there was nothing in the film that was identifiable, and couldn't have been shot on a Hollywood sound stage, or in any pine forest in North America. My major criticism are the beyond the pale distortion of the facts. One explosion, not 2, and when the plane landed, in reality he was immediately arrested. The rest of the movie was just totally unbelievable and impossible. Hitler and the SS were brutal killers, they were totally in control, and in reality killed most of the conspirators and their families, and imprisoned the rest. (See Dietrich Bonhoeffer)"
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I was expecting more from this movie. Although it probably followed the facts of the attempt on Hitler's life, it was pedantic and somewhat boring to me. Guess I'm too used to the fast paced shoot-em-up of todays' films, although I do enjoy factual historical films and have a large collection of war movies, some true some fiction.This if not Tom Cruise's greatest work. He did a much better job in ""Collateral"" and ""A Few Good Men"""
2,American Accent?,"Can anyone tell me why a german soldier not only speaks english, but also has an American accent? and Why his surrounding officers have british accents? Even if you did put that aside, this movie falls short. It had potential to be great, but ultimately falls short just as the plot to kill Hitler had. From what I have read this film is wrather unaccurate as well. Tom Cruises character was apparantly much more of a Nazi sympathizer than this film would have you believe."
2,Boring and Unrealistic,"Although I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, I received the DVD as a gift. I watched the movie with an open mind and was very disappointed. I suppose, rent if you are a fan of Tom Cruise, but otherwise stay away."
2,Shame on MGM AND Tom Cruise!,"Terrible cgi work,Old English/British actors GALORE repping German characters,this movie is prune dry one minute,frenetic and irritating the next....and bottom shelf,MGM:Tom:PU!Take the money and run..............."
1,"Great movie, bad audio",You would think by now the studios would be able to manufacture a quality Blu-Ray disk. But NO....great movie is destroyed by POOR Audio....
4,Better than the articles lead you to believe,"In the midst of WWII, there were many within Hitler's military that knew his path was leading them to destruction. Not many did anything about it, but some took a stand. This is the story of those who did. Colonel Stauffenberg led a daring plot to assassinate Hitler and take control of the army. If this plan was successful, the war would end. We all know that despite the attempts on his life, Hitler took his own life when he realized that his defeat was imminent. Knowing the outcome of this film doesn't make it any less entertaining. They media gave this movie a lot of negative feedback. I think we all know why too. Despite Tom Cruise being a nutcase, he is a fine actor. This movie is proof. It has many talented actors, tons of suspense and a well written plot. It's a great film. I highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 10."
4,Some gave all.,"Although widely perceived as a ""Tom Cruise movie"", ""Valkyrie"" is really an ensemble piece, featuring other top names like Kenneth Branaugh and Terence Stamp. It is an excellent, intelligent thriller, and even though the audience knows the outcome in advance, the film never once loses its suspenseful drive.By shining a light on the inner workings of the Nazi regime, ""Valkyrie"" shows that not all Germans were united with Hitler, and that some gave their lives to restore the Germany they remembered from before the dark days of National Socialism."
2,A Suspense Thriller?,"It's a History Channel Docudrama with better acting and production quality. OK for that, I guess, but the whole flick is designed as a suspense thriller and virtually everyone knows the ending (if you don't then by all means see it). Little dificult to build the suspense they try so hard for given that.Not saying it might not be worth a look as a rental or on TV, but...you get the idea."
1,A big disappointment,What could have been a top rate movie was destroyed by one thing and one only. You could hardly hear the words being spoken and you were drowned out by the loudness of the music. Whoever did the sound should consider another profession and Tom Cruise needs to take lessons in voice projection.
1,Absolutely One of the Worst Movies about the Third Reich Ever!!,"I love WWII movies and was looking forward to this one. The supporting cast seemed to be worth the price of admission, but then I hadn't figured on Tom Cruise's performance being one of his worst. He is dreadfully miscast, although I'm sure concessions were made when he came on board. This is a boring, foolish movie: poor script, no direction and incredibly misused talent.Steer clear of Valkyrie and buy Downfall or Conspiracy or even Night of the Generals. There is no excuse for such poor film-making in this day and time."
1,Can't believe I Paid for This?,"I usually watch movies to be entertained, if it's based on historical facts or a true story, then so much the better.But, this was not entertaining in the least, I put this one with one other movie I saw a long time ago, A Mighty wind. This one blows too. Everything was bad, the script, the acting. If you need something to put you to sleep, this will do it for you.The title, is what caught my interest, but that is the only thing interesting about the whole movie."
5,Valykrie,A good movie. It didn't add anything to what I knew about the plot but was well done. Arrived on time and in good condition.
3,"Cruise disappoints, but the movie is still decent","A very professionally made movie, with no obvious flaws. But it also never gets very engaging. Part of that problem goes to Tom Cruise. I'm not a Cruise-basher like so many people - I like him in some movies, disappointed with him in others. This is one of the latter, where I feel like I'm watching an actor, not a real character.Points do go to director Bryan Singer, who somehow manages to wring some suspense out of the story, even when we already know the final outcome. That's a pretty good feat in itself! And the movie looks great as well, kudos to the cinematographer. Overall, could have been better, but could have been worse."
5,"Breathtaking, inspiring, storytelling","I just watched this movie on DVD again after seeing during it's release in December 2008. I was curious to see if it would have the same impact the second time around. It absolutely did not disappoint.I don't read movie reviews as a rule, nor do I know much about actors...All I can say is this is one of the most well-acted, incredibly well toldhistorical films I have ever seen. I am so glad the sacrifices and struggles endured by the real conspirators have been honored by such a well-crafted, beautifully scored film.I would recommend this film highly to families with older children who are particular about quality viewing. The story itself a relentless lesson about character and sacrifice for the greater good that has few rivals in history."
1,Agonizing,"Good grief. So here we have it, once more it is the Bush administration's fault. All of us evil conservatives want to beat down people of color. Give me a break.Don't bother with this one, it is just one more screed from the left that robs people of hope. This book is damaging to your soul. If you listen to it you will get exactly what it portends. Ignore it and believe in what is possible. This is America. Anyone can do anything they set their mind to. Read ""No Excuses"" by the Thernstroms instead."
3,Would not buy Uniden again,"Radio worked fine for 2-1/2 seasons, until I had to use it in the rain. It has never worked properly since. Seems to me that a Marine radio should be sufficiently waterproof not to fail from exposure to rain."
4,Too funky!,"I love this stationery. Everyone who got a letter written with it raved about how cool it was. I just wish that there were a few more sheets of paper, or a few less envelopes (I prefer a ratio of 2 sheets to 1 envelope, not that you can find that these days)."
5,This is the best group coming out of the SOUTH SIDE of Chgo!,"Infamous Syndicate's music is the BOMB. Being from Chi-town myself, I really feel proud of who's coming out and representing properly which Infamous Syndicate are doing very well. My favorite cuts on the album are ""What That Boy Like"", ""Westside"" and ""Here I Go"". For those who haven't got the album ""Changing the Game"" GET IT!!."
2,Should Listen Before Buying,"I received the CD still in its package in a timely fashion. There's a song on the CD I've been wanting for a while. Other than that one song, the CD isn't that good."
3,Absolutely 1daful....4 Mya Fans Only,"Mya's third album is her best one to date, but those who are true Mya fans will be the only ones who will TRULY appreciate this CD. I personally am not one, but I simply CAN'T hate on Ms. Mya. The songs were well written, and the verse that Lloyd Banks dropped on ""Why You Gotta Look So Good"" is absolute fire!!! This is just a sign of things to come from Mya. If so, her next CD will undoubtedly be an instant classic. So, try it for yourself. Only the biggest Mya haters won't at least be a lil pleased with ""Moodring""."
4,My oh My has Mya Improved and Matured,"Mya has truly matured and definitely aimed to do better than the first and second album. With singing, she had the chance the write, produce, and executive produce on the album.Songs like ""Take A Picture"", which Pink had the chance to co-write, showcases Mya's versatility, along with ""Things Come And Go"" with Sean Paul. Other highlight tracks include a very emotional ""After The Rain"" and ""Free Fallin"". The bounce track off the album is ""Step"""", which basically commands all man takers and do just that when it comes to her man and the very catchy ""My Love Is Like Woo"", both Missy Elliott had a chance to write and produce on. The more eccentric of tracks on the album is the bonus track ""Real Compared To What"" with Common. It's jazzy, groovy, and funky. It's a really great song.Embrace Mya's growth as a female entertainer. Lay back after a very stressful day, take a breath, turn your stereo system on, and connect with Mya's Moodring (Haters Not Included)."
1,"Oh Paleeze,help this child!","Let me say this if you're thinking about buying Mya's 3rd effort:NO NO NO.I usually dont write reviews but I had to.Mya tried to pull the cover over our eyes and ears.Okay,I know you're grown but if you buy it,don't say I didn't tell ya so.But if your intrested in a Mya album go with her 2nd album Fear of Flying.By far the best.But hey you can't get lucky all the time right Mya?Buy the single 'Fallin' and save yourself some money.I give this album a-oh no she didn't,i'm taking off my earings, it's about to get ugly."
3,What is this,"Ok normally I love Myas music but onthis cd the only songs I liked were ""My love is like Whoa"" ""Fallen"" and ""Late"" the rest of it sounded like they let a 2 year mix it. Mya sounds like an 11 year old on some songs, why do people lie to singers and tell them that all theyre songs are great when they really suck?"
1,Don't judge a book by it's cover!!,"I have to admit, when I saw the album cover for ""Moodring"" it got my attention, and I really wanted to hear it because if it looks good, it must sound good, right? Wrong! Thank God I heard it in a friend's car before I bought this crap! I saved $11 to spend on something else! The production is terrible, the lyrics are all about you know what, and Mya shows us that she can't sing for anything. Don't judge a book by it's cover, it's what's on the inside that counts!"
1,HUH!,WHAT THE H##ll DID I buy?!?! this is the worst MYA CD!! do not buy it and do not play into the hype of the other reviews! this cd sucks big time!! You can do either of two things when you see this CD on the shelf or on Amazon. Buy it because you dont believe me when I said it sucks! or buy Marques Houston's CD instead. trust me you will love it. unless anyone wants to buy Mya's cd from me. i am willing to sell this ish for $2.00
2,Skip It.,"Mya's reps are smart. they put out her best songs (My Love is Like...Wo, Fallen, Real Compared to What), so everyone could hear them, & like them. Once we like them, we buy the rest of the CD. But the rest of the CD is GARBAGE. Her singles SALVAGE a worthless CD.Vocally Mya isn't impressive anyway, but this is insane. True fans of Mya will appreciate her computerized crooning, but people who prefer real vocal skills will not enjoy this CD. Don't get me wrong, Mya is beautiful, but this CD is a letdown from the pretty good (considering it's Mya) Fear of Flying. Buy the singles, skip the album."
2,Mya's New CD is like .... ewwww,"Well, her love may be like ... wo, but her new album, Moodring, is like ... ewwww. Save your money (and your time) on this one. I love Mya and her first two albums are two of my favorite albums of all time. But this album is a stinker."
2,TERRIBLE,"MYA HAS BEEN FLOPING SINCE HER SOPHMORE ALBUM....THIS ALBUM IS TO KIDDY AND TOO POP.... OUT OF ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM THERE ARE EXACTLY 2 GOOD SONGS ON THE CD (WHOA, AND ANATOMY)I SURE HOPE SHE DOES BETTER ON HER NEXT ATTEMPT"
1,this is not worth any star,"That [imitation] of Tom Petty's classic rock song surely is one of the worst [imitations] ever made. It certainly is the biggest load of rubbish I ever heard in my entire life. haha. A beast of a song. For real, Mya looks nice and all but please, don't spend your money on this [weak item]. ..."
5,Mya's Back & Better Than Ever,"After more than 1 year in the studio, Mya has nothing to fear after the release of her new album ""Moodring"". On the album she express what she is and what she became. Miss Harrison produced and took alot of place in making her album; she contributed to every track on the album. So we can definitly say that it's a 100% Mya's album. Mya has hot rythm and beats on her record without forgetting contribution from Saul Paul & Missy Elliot! Pop, R&B, Soul, the album got it all...It's really worth listening to...you wont regret it!"
2,Not Her Best,"Mya ia an awesome singer but on this album Im sorry to say that it was a waste of my time and money. Although it did sow a side of her that know one has seen before. Unless you are a real juge Mya fan u might want to save your 13.00 cause this really isn't worht it. The only song that I ,ersonally like is My Love Is Like Wo Fallen isn't that bad either."
2,Debut was better,"I have been a Mya fan ever since she put out her first CD and I really loved ""All About Me"", Movin' On"" , and ""If You Died, I Wouldn't Cry..."" Even after the second, I preferred the first. I like how Mya had independent girl songs. Now, eveything seems to be very sexual and not have much point. She is still WAY more talented than Beyonce...but this CD was disappointing. We got two better songs from Christina which really surprised me. BUT don't give up on Mya. She has a long future."
2,WOW,"I'm amazed at how many people gave this album 5 stars. All I can say is that I am glad I bought this CD used for less than 5 dollars. There was only 2 songs that were worth listening to: My Love is Like Wo and Fallen. And I am sorry I refuse to pay 17 bucks for an album with 2 decent songs. And the musicians have a nerve to be angry because we download albums and buy bootleg. When they start making alubms that are worthy of 17 bucks then I will start paying full price. Mya has a decent voice at best and frankly needs to get beyond that teeny-boper sound. She is beyond 21 and frankly her music just hasn't matured. I like her first song My Love is Like Wo, bascially because the beat is unique. But the lyrics frankly aren't noteworthy. Oh well, again I will say that I am glad I didn't pay full price for this one."
4,Career is not looking that good.,"She's a beautiful woman, but her singing ability is not that great. She can dance, but in order to make it in the business, you have to have the whole package. I still like her though."
3,mya,"mya third lp she grow somewhat on this cd but she could did must better than this she covers tom petty ,s free fallin she,s done other covers like dolly parton but this cover this diffrent in a way most pop chicks do a crappy job of rock covers exmaple (shakira,s verison of amerosimth dude look like lady) pretty bad she did that cover she before came to the breakthrought oral fixation 2 she came with where are thieves back before that, to mya change the words the song and did a decent verison of the song 6 /10 i known mya since the frist lp in 98 the same time i met shakira i hope mya what cover will she do next troi amos or yes i hope the next cd is better. mya did better than thosse two chicks mr dion and shakria."
1,Moodring left me in a bad mood,"This album totally sucks, and I am glad that I did not purchase it. I borrowed it from my public library. The only song that I like on this album is ""Step""."
3,"MYA IS SEXY,,,,AND SO HOT!!!!!!",3 STARS IS WHAT THIS ALBUM IS TO ME....COULD HAVE HAD MORE DANCE BEATS!!!!
4,Excellent,This album was off the chain ya'll Mya has really improved. You can tell by the way her music sounds. SHe is here and here to stay If you don't have it go and get it I don't know what you are waiting for.
4,This album is good.,"Mya sounded very solid on this album. I like how she took chances on many of the songs. She's taking no mess on another woman taking her man on a few of the more aggressive songs, even that ""B"" song. The songs by Hanes, Hill and Veney are perhaps the best on the album and give the Rockwilder, Ron Fair, Missy Elliott and Jam and Lewis songs a run for their money. Her writing and co-producing on most of the songs give the songs a lot of personality and depth."
2,What the **** you fill in the blank,Mya was very smart by putting the best songs on the album as singles. She should be sued for false advertisement. If you by this album you will be greatly disappointed. DON'T BY THIS ALBUM!!!!! I can't believe she released this album. What the ****?
3,Sorry Mya...,"When I first heard Mya's song ""My love is like...Wo"", I thought it was a catchy tune but really didn't do nothing for me. The album is also a let down especially ""Fallen"". Afraid to fly was a much better album, It has more r'n'b and hip-hop beats with favourites such as ""The best of me"" and ""Lie detecter"" both including raps."
4,Beautiful...,Beautifully done!!! She is truly gifted and under-rated. *After the Rain* is touching...
5,The Best Cd Ever,This CD is the bomb. I play over and over again in my cd player. To everybody who says that this Cd is bad. Um sorry to tell you but u are really wrong. If u havent yet go out and buy this Cd.
5,Mya is at her best!!!!,Mya has out done herself in this bangin aldum and you should BUY MOODRING RIGHT NOW ON AMAZON.COM go mya
5,THIS IS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mya has come back again with a bang! Her lyrics and rythym definately show how much she's grown these past few years. I especially like the song ""Whatever B****""!!!! This whole cd put a smile on my face. It is very enjoyable and i'd recommend it to anyone who likes nice pop/r&b beats and lyrics."
3,After Listening...Not In A Good Mood,"After hearing ""My Love Is Like..Wo"", I thought the album would be really good, but is has 5 good songs and the rest are forgettable. Best Songs:My Love Is Like..Wo!-Missy produced it...Step- about protecting your relationshipWhy You Gotta Look So Good? (w/ Lloyd Banks)-cool songFallen-being in love. Smooth songLate- interesting lyrics...listenOverall, Mya's album is so-so, if she recorded 5 or 6 more songs that match the caliber of those listed, she would have a great album."
4,Pretty Good CD!,"Moodring is a pretty good CD, but could have been a little better if more thought and time was put into it. Best songs here are ""Things Come 'N Go,"" ""Who's That Lady,"" ""Fallen,"" and ""Taste Me."" I thought some of the other tracks were a bit boring like ""Whatever Bitch,"" ""My Love Is Like Wo,"" ""Real Compared to What"" and ""Hurry Up."" Those tracks werent all that great. But if you like Mya then buy the CD for the good tracks on here! I like that she includes the lyrics but on this CD she swears alot cuz she's has this new care-free attitude. Some tracks are a bit short like the first one and could've been longer. Overall, it's still a pretty good album and enjoyable too. Make this your next buy!"
5,MYA IS ON FIRE,"FROM GHETTO SUPERSTAR TO MY LOVE IS LIKE...WOO MYA HAS NOT LOST HER TALENT OF ENTERTAINING ME. HER NEW ALBUM MOODRING IS MY PROOF AND HER FIRE IS BURNIN THE ROOF!SHE REALLY CAME UP WITH SONGS THAT HOMEGIRLS CAN RELATE TOO SUCH AS ""LATE"" AND ""STEP"" BUT WHAT I REALLY LOVE ABOUT THIS C.D. IS THE SONG ""SOPHISTICATED LADY"" WHICH SHOWS US MYA'S LOVE FOR OLD SCHOOL! SO WHAT ARE U WAITING FOR PEOPLE ???? SEE IT TO BELIVE IT! GO GET THE ALBUM IT WILL LEAVE YOU SAYIN WO......."
5,Express Yourself,Mya is sending out a new trend or shall I say a new fashion. Pretty much she's beening Mya and showing us how she expresses her inter thoughts and feelings. Instead of keeping things bottled in express your self to the highest level and let the world know who you are.Do yo' thang Babygyrl
3,Her One Good Album,"Not a big Mya fan. She cute, has a ''ok'' voice, and can dance her butt off but she can't carry a whole album to save her life. Every album will have a handful of good songs and the rest are just fullers. This album is no different but it has alot more good songs this fullers. The only problem is this album is a little too long and all the songs start sounding alike after awhile.My Faves1. My Love is Like . . . Whoa2. Fallen3. Step4. Things Come and GoOverall this is a 3 star album with alot of fun songs but nothing groundbreaking"
3,Dissappointed a little.... :/,"Okay, I bought this because I heard ONE song that won me over - which was ""Fallen"". This CD is the reason why I miss the days when they used to sell CD's that only had that ONE song on it so you wouldn't waste any more of your money buying the rest of them that aren't really worth listening to. Needless to say...I paid TOO much for this CD - $10.95 - since it was clearly only worth the cost of that ONE song on it...I don't know. I like her voice but the songs not so much. I'm sure the die-hard Mya fans might disagree but the music or lack of it speaks for itself."
5,A little bit of this and that,"I love Mya, and her new album keeps it that way. the tracks on the new album are reflective of the albums title. Every track had its own vibe and style, just like a mood ring. There are lots of songs you can dance to, like the first single ""My Love is like...Whoa"" and a few really meaningful slower songs like ""After the Rain"" No matter what your mood you'll find a song that fits your attitude."
3,Okay album,"This album is okay but not her best work.Go pick up a copy of Janet's ""Damita Jo"" in stores March 30th, that's a hot album.. you WON'T be dissapointed."
5,"""Mya, you're a Superstar, that is what you are!!!!","I was compelled to write this review, though normally I don't write them! Mya took this cd to the 10th power, ok? It is obvious to me that she worked very hard on this cd and in separating herself from the rest of the r&b; ""bunnies"". From the first to the last track there IS a mood change and there is a vocal improvement. She pushed her beautiful soprano further thanbefore , therefore hinting at the fact that there is more there. The video for ""Like Wo"" is amazing the song fits flawlessly as do her live performances. It is OBVIOUS that there is some kind of reluctance to give her, her props or give her the covers that she deserves, simply because she blew the roof off of r&b; this year. This is a REAL album not a SEX SELLS album like that other ""gal"" put out. There are at least 6 singles and videos off this album and if they don't do you right Mya you need to fire your record company and everybody connected!!!!!!!"
4,An obscure gem,"Mr. Bonesteel (the previous reviewer - what an interesting name) is right. This collection is more jazz than blues. But either ""The Late Late Show"" by Dakota Staton, or especially, ""Baltimire Oriole"", a Hoagy Carmichael tune, sung by Sheila Jordan, is worth the price of the CD all by itself. I wish I knew if there was a Vol. 1."
4,Moby One Kenobi.,"I'd say that for a collection of just SOME of his soundtrack work, this is very good. Ever since I heard ""Ah-Ah"" on the ""Cool World"" soundtrack, I've been a fan. ""Go"" of course is another favorite, as I enjoy the theme from ""Twin Peaks"" sampled. ""New Dawn Fades"" is awesome and hypnotic, and also his version of the ""James Bond Theme"" will take you to 007th heaven. Maybe this isn't the first Moby disc to get, but it's definitely a score."
3,Some Good Stuff,"This release is not the most particularly strong mix of music that Moby has ever created. Many of the songs are from Moby's earlier releases (such as First Cool Hive, God Moving Over the Face of the Waters, Go, etc), and are almost all remixed to better fit the needs for the movies they were in. While this CD has some neat gems like the James Bond Theme (which is funky, fast paced, and energetic), this album definately drags at times with some of the super down tempo instrumentals that does not give the world a great idea about what Moby is truly about. A better repository of early Moby work can be found on MobySongs 93-98, which includes most of the work off this CD."
4,A very cool disc with 4 priceless tracks.,"I bought this disc after falling in love with ""Play"" and am glad I did. It is not as good as ""Play"" but there are 4 tracks that are worth the price of this disc: ""Novio"" is haunting, ""James Bond Theme"" is a brilliant and witty rethinking of 007 music, ""New Dawn Fades"" from the movie ""Heat"" captures that film's hard edges perfectly while ""God Moving Over The Face Of The Waters"" (also from ""Heat"") is elegant dreamy and beautiful. There is not a single weak cut among the reamining eight."
4,gardening,I like the book. There aren't many books on shade gardening one and this will be very helpful to me and my gardening.
2,cheap,cheap food good for any 1 that really doesnt care about there fish growth or health AA a a a a a a a a a a a a
5,Good buy,"Great product for a very good price. I am quite positive I will order this item, again. Best offer I could find."
5,What a savings!,I've been purchasing pond fish food locally in small containers.....here I got this huge bag for only twice the cost of one small container.....food for months longer for just a tad more....I'll be back.
5,Great value,Great product and great price. We will save a lot of money this year as we usually just buy small bags every couple of weeks at our local nursery. We have about six fairly large koi and numerous small ones from last seasons babies and this bag will last all year. Will definitely order again.
3,Fair,"When I first opened the bag, it smelled pretty appetizing. I have two 2 inch koi, and one 3 inch koi. They don't seem to like it as much, or as eager to eat it as the other brand. Maybe the bigger koi would like it better because the pallets are kind of big."
2,My fish don't eat it!,"My fish won't eat this food! I guess you get what you pay for; 1/3 the usual price, 1/3 the usual quality."
5,fish eat it.,my fish eat it and are alive and well so i guess its fine. also alot less stinky than the food i had before.
2,Fish Colors Faded,"I bought this food after going through a large bag of Top Fin Koi Food. My fish ate it very well, but after a week or so their vibrant colors faded noticeably. I've switched back to Top Fin."
1,Fish would not eat,"My fish would not eat the food, not sure why. I had some of thier old food left over put that in and they ate everything but this new food?"
2,Review of Kaytee Koi's choice food,"I had read other reviews of this product and they were overall pretty good. The price was great and I've have been very satisfied with other Kaytee products I have used. So I bought it. I fed it to my Koi fish for several days and they wouldn't eat it. I had to throw the whole bag away. For me, it was a waste of $20.00."
2,You get what you pay for,"My fish eat through a fair amount of food, so I decided to try the Kaytee food since it is cheaper than most everything else on the market.Well, there's a reason. Several of my koi started losing their color (one is just plain white now), or their coloring has gotten muddled (where previously they had a sharp contrast.)I've switched back toTetra Pond Koi Vibrance Floating Pond Sticks, 8.27 Pounds-- saving a little money on food to have ugly fish is a bad trade-off in my book."
1,Don't buy it!,"My fish just won't eat this stuff. Definitely not premium fish food! I should have check the other 1 star customer review before buying it. Also, the resealable bag is useless."
2,No Better Than The Catfish Food,"I have been feeding my koi with catfish food for months. After reading all the positive feedbacks here, I thought I would give this a try.Instead of paying $18 for a 50 lb. catfish food, I paid more than $20 for a 10 lb. ""koi food"" only to find out my koi didn't like this anymore than they liked the catfish food. In fact, they appeared to prefer the catfish food a bit more.Their favorite was to suck blood worm out of their hiding. Since my pond is not filtered, it has plenty of that. If that still wasn't enough, they would dig around for vegetables. They would jump on the goldfish flakes if I offer it to them, but if they are still hungry, they would eat these pellets.So, my guess is it's all relative. Without giving your fish a buffet table with many different entries to choose from, you wouldn't know what they like better."
5,Excellent!,"Agree with the other reviewers. This is good koi food for a really good price. Do you want growth or sustenance only? Check the protein content of the food, if you want growth you need a higher percentage of protein. I use higher protein for summer and lower protein for spring and autumn.To ensure that my koi have a well balanced diet, I mix my food, I buy color enhancing food for the spring and summer and use lesser foods for autumn when they're powering down. I also feed them krill as treats.So in summary, I basically use this food as filler and use higher protein or coloring food at different times. Most important of all, my fish have no complaints and gobble this up!"
3,Great First part and no ending,"Clade has a novel setting in a collapsed biosphere, and a hero living in San Jose (talk about collapse) and made artificially allergic to other places, so snaps for that. On the other hand, the rest of it is tried and true, to the point you could write it in your sleep. Its like going to a ""creative"" burger or pizza place in that yes, some of the details are fresh and intriguing, but in the end its the same old burger and fries or pepperoni and cheese (anxious striving dweeb, caught between rock and hard place and annoying family and girlfriend, yadda yadda). And the ending, I can honestly say I read exactly the same thing in at least one other book this year... It was really more interesting to imagine some of the OTHER characters telling THEIR stories as opposed to this nebbishy guy we are stuck with. Maybe next time will see more energy in the story and less in the faux angst department."
1,Where was the editor?,"The author of this book seems well intentioned, but just was not up to the task. He seems to know quite a bit of Latino slang, but that is not enough to save the book.The plot is incoherent, the dialogue clunky, and the sex scene laughable. However, I really blame the editor for the mess. He or she seems to have run out of steam after about 100 pages and left the author to founder on his own. I doubt that even he has any idea what is supposed to be happening, and he is completely incapable of explaining it to the reader.The last straw for me was when he used ""penultimate"" to mean ""ultimate"". Buy a dictionary, dude!"
4,Very Interesting Woman,"I am very happy that a book was written about Juliet Strauss. She was a very interesting woman; forward thinking as a writer and a woman in the period of time that she lived. I enjoyed reading this book and I think that the author did a credible job. The only thing I was disappointed about was the lack of detail in some areas of her life. For example one of Juliet's daughter's died quite young, and the cause of death was never mentioned. This could be more complete, but overall a good biography of her life."
3,My humble opinion,"I read this play as part of a class assignment, but was impressed by the clarity and depth of emotion with which the material was presented. The play's authors have done an excellent job of presenting a non-European interpretation of history. This play made me approach Kenyan history with a different view. However, it did not provide any background information on the Mau Mau rebellion, making it difficult to understand the character's motivations. Overall, it was an interesting and insightful piece of work, but one I would reccommend only to someone with a decided interest in the effect of colonialism in Kenya."
2,lack of examples to follow advice,"There are no examples in the book. No examples of thesis statements, or maybe an example of a paper layout.Fun easy book to read, with lots of quotes from professors. I don't feel ""stronger"" after reading this."
2,And hopefully your last,"Advice to Cevin: with all sincerity and due respect stick with the sound of track 1 ""Beautiful Day"" (it was beautiful), but the rest of the album fell of the cliff from there on. What Happened?"
2,Only two tracks!!!!!!!,"I could not believe it, I thought let's spend $14 on this cd just to see it would be better than the last on, it turns out even worse, I liked only two tracks of this cd, they were dangerous and put your hands.... the rest is fake everyhing about him is fake."
5,Fire,"Dont get burn while touchin diz masterpieace... Busta's when disaster strikes was another banger... Best tracks ? "" surivval hungry"" , ""get off my block "" , ""we could take it outside"" hip hop at its purest form son..."
5,Original and Unique,"Busta Rhymes is one of the wildest out there! He doesn't care what anyone thinks, and he does his own thing. He is one of my favorites along with Lost Boyz, DMX, Ice Cube, Master P and others."
4,Best album of the 3 CD trilogy,"This album broke Busta through to the masses. Songs like the anthemic ""Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See"" and trunk thumpers like ""Dangerous,"" ""One,"" ""Rhymes Galore,"" and ""Get High Tonight"" made this album stand out from the rest of the pack in 97. The other songs on the album aren't as good as the aforementioned ones, but it's still a worthy purchase for the previously mentioned songs above."
5,His best?,"This is Busta's peak, this album is one for people who like rap, not people who only like rap hooks. Good from start to finish. This is also a rap album for people who like good music, countless people who hate rap love this album. Im not quite sure why, probably because this is one of the best rap albums ever pressed. Bottom line, you like good music, this is for you."
3,Mellow Busta?,"I am not a huge fan of Busta and I don't pretend to be but I really liked some of his songs...they were unlike anything I had ever heard. I bought this cd in hopes to hear that crazy, never-take-a-breath between lyrics style and was very disappointed. This cd proved to be laid back and mellow compared to the rest of his work. If you're like me and are looking for the one of a kind, fast paced style, don't buy this cd...look to his other releases."
4,Good,I fell in love with the characters in the first book and couldn't wait to see what happened on Earth. But I was disappointed in the second book and where all the family members ended up. It made the story seem disjointed.
1,Useless,Did not adhere to dashboard no matter what we tried. I received a credit and got the beanbag dashboard holder that works well.Zero stars is not an option.
4,Power Thrash,"Another one of those talented yet overlooked American metal bands from the late 1980's, Heretic played a style of thrash metal that was infused with plenty of power metal elements, sounding quite similar to Vicious Rumors and Metal Church. In fact, the latter band's Kurdt Vanderhoof handles production duties on this album. Heretic provides everything you expect from the West Coast metal scene in the 80's, like wall to wall riffs, intricate guitar solos, and a powerful vocal wail. Prepare to bang thy head!Breaking Point was the band's final album. Guitarist Brian Korban and bassist Dennis O'Hara went on to join Reverend with former Metal Church vocalist David Wayne (RIP)."
4,Bring the heresy!,"mike howe has an amazing voice and brian korban is a guitar god!you can also hear howe on metal churches ""human factor"", ""hanging in the balance"", and ""blessing in disguise"", while korban can be heard in (ironically) reverend, the solo band of david wayne, the guy mike howe replaced in metal church!"
3,Question about the binding,"This isn't a review of the book's content, but rather one of the book itself: I'm particularly irritated by the manner in which the paperback text was bound. Although I'm reluctant to actually go ahead and do so to see, I don't think it's possible to fully read each page all the way to the margin without breaking the spine of the text. Was Continuum just trying to save money on paper by condensing the margins, or what? Particularly as one nears the middle of the book, it becomes exceedingly difficult to read the entirety of the verso sheet.Quite frustrating. Not to suggest that Verso's publications are any better, nor any less expensive for the poor quality - the publishing market for leftist theory seems to have a major form / content problem going on."
3,not so fascinating,"Perhaps because I am French and know this book for a long while, it has not for me the charm of novelty and I am not so fascinated by it. Badiou's application of the set theory to the ontology of history is never really justified in his work. ""The mathematicians dream when they come to being"", said once Plato. Morever, the style - except for the presentation of some aspects of Gödel's theorem - is gothic, sometimes really obscure and, at least in French, dated. If you like a certain posture, both dogmatic and despiseful for all that is not Badiou's thought (except Heidegger, strangely interpreted, and Marxism), you should read this opus. ""Being and Event"" did not have a strong impact on european philosophy - outside a small circle of disciples - and I doubt very much that it will have one on american thought."
4,Love It!,"I love the GWF7. I was a little skeptical at first, but I decided to try it out and it was awesome. This is a perfect solution if you are like me, that hates to go to the water dispenser to refill your bottles or don't want the expensive delivery service. Solves everything."
5,Love it,"Have had this for over a year. We have not noticed any oder or nasty tasting water, just clean fresh tasting water that rivals the best bottled water at a GREAT savings. What a find!"
3,Green way filtration,The cover came with a timer on it that didn't work...The timer was suppose to go off when the filter was old and when you fill it up to filter the water it only works with the top part the bottom part never releases any water
5,Romance in Ireland,"This cd collection was a wonderful experience. Each story was about a different sister, and their search for happiness and romance. My favorite was Born in Ice. However, all three were fantastic. This collection will be something you will be glad to have in your collection."
5,My Personal Favorite of All Nora Roberts's Trilogies,"Reading this trilogy, my personal favorite of all Nora Roberts's trilogy, has led to some wonderful things, the most exciting of which was visiting County Clare, Ireland, the setting for this trilogy, in the fall of 1999.My favorite of the three stories is BORN IN ICE, but all three sisters' stories are terrific and I am so glad they are now available together in one volume for my keeper shelf."
1,Dissapointed,Bought this for the daily commute but it must be a copy because it will not work in my car cdc player. It will work in my computer but no where else.
1,Never Received,"I never reveived this book. The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it. Who do I need to contact??????"
3,Good but not the best,"This is a consistently good set of readings, yet I cannot feel that any of the individual performances are equal to the best by other conductors. The 5th is somewhat slow in tempo and lacking forward movement and tension, and a burble by a horn player at a critical moment in the second movement should have been edited out. Having said that, the conductor does well with the later movements, sustaining forward movement and drama as well as anyone. Likewise, his 1st is good, and is an accessible introduction to the work, but simply not the best; the same can be said of his 4th, in which the tempos are well chosen but the performance isn't managed with the same degree of fire and drama that others find in it. So all in all, a cycle with consistently good performances, but Blomstedt, and especially Rozhdestvensky, would really be first choices for a complete set. (Along with the BIS set that mixes performances by Chung and Jarvi.)"
3,Good---and ironic---book by JFK's first Secret Service Chief,"As the leading civilian authority on the United States Secret Service, I modestly recommend this book by JFK's first Secret Service Chief, Urbanus Edmund ""U.E."" Baughman (who was replaced as Chief in late 1961 by the SAIC of the WHD, James J. Rowley). The book is readable and pretty well put together. There are many examples of rich irony throughout: Baughman receiving the call to become Cheif on November 22 [1948]...Baughman is, ahem, ""retired"" by a President who would meet his ultimate fate on November 22 [1963]...Baughman waxes on about the virtues of Richard Nixon for President at a time when Tricky Dicky was dead in the water, politically speaking...etc."
5,La Renga: una representacion,"La renga se destaca por saber mezclar las realidades del pais, un buen acompañamiento musical, la pasion futbolera, su fuerza, la identificacion de los jovenes. Las letras dicen mucho, y el que diga lo contrario es porque no las escucho o no las razono. La exelente calidad de CHIZO como guitarrista, la sobresaliente actuacion de los instrumentos de viento (armonica, saxo) y el muy buen acompañamiento del bajo y la bateria. Quisas de el disco ""a donde me lleva la vida..."" al ultimo, su rock a variado pero la esencia, la alegria de la gente que los sigue siguen intactos."
5,The Very Best Cookbook I Ever Had!,"Donna Hays' cookbooks have changed my approach to the drudgery of everyday meals & opened up a healthy, fast & very enjoyable passtime. I used to HATE to cook - now I am planning on re-doing my kitchen. My family loves the simple, yet very tasty meals - & a picture of every recipe helps! Thank you Donna - More Please!"
5,Love it,"Combo of pics and simple recipes using both common and uncommon ingredients is so enticing. Even though I believe I am an advanced cook, I felt like I was still learning from this New Food Fast cookbook."
4,great book,"When I first started flipping through this book, I thought I wasn't going to like it. For some reason, the first chapter was full of seafood, and even though I love it, I can't get my husband to eat it. As I continued to flip through, I found one great idea after another -- even recipes that my picky hubby would eat. And they're so quite and easy. Plus, her presentation tips make me look like a better cook than I really am!!! Love this book and can't wait to make more of its recipes!!!"
1,Not USDA Certified Organic,"Amazon.com has failed to correct the PRODUCT FEATURES for this item. They have it as USDA Certified Organic, but when I got it, NOWHERE on the actual package does it have the USDA logo! some of the ingredients are organic, but it's NOT organic like they have listed. I called Amazon to let them know, they gave my money back, but they haven't corrected the information under the product features for this item!I only eat USDA organic food, so I really don't know if it's good or not. But if you don't eat only USDA organic, give it a try!"
3,Krayzie Bones solo album disapoints.,Don't get me wrong I like Bone as much as the next guy but you can't tell me this album is the bomb. I thought this was a solo album then why are Bizzy and Layzie up in this album. Unlike Bizzy Bones' Heavanz Movie this doesn't showcase enough of Krayzies individual talents. This album is good but it could have been alot better.
5,KitchenAid non-stick saucepan,I have used this pan daily for a year now and really enjoy it. It is a handy size and things cook very well in it without sticking. I most appreciate not having to use so much oil (ie calories) in my foods.
5,easy to care for,I finally found a frying pan with perfect inside and bottom. Cooks perfectly and easy to clean.
1,I DONT NEED ANYONE TO OUTLINE HOW TO RAISE MY CHILD BUT GOD,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY LIKE I DID. JUST ORDER ""BABY & CHILD CARE"", BECAUSE THAT BOOK IS A REAL HELP!"
4,A must for 5 Star fans,If you loved the young 80's r&b group 5 Star then this is the Cd Collection for you. It is a comprehensive compilation of their hits as well as their lesser known music. It's difficult to find this collection in the record stores. I recommend buying this cd.
2,Legends - 5 Star,There were alot of songs that I didn't know. If you were only familiar with certain songs from 5 Star I would not recommend this CD. Their greatest hits would be just fine.
4,Flying the Flag,"Graceffo is one of the funniest adventure/travel writers I have read. If Kurt Vonnegut traveled the world he would give us side-splitting anecdotes like Antonio has. The Monk from Brooklyn was a difficult book to put down, I was constantly curious how Graceffo would cope with being to only foreigner at ""SHAOLIN"". I also wondered how long until his American patience would give out and when I would turn the page to read about Antonio going ""Bruce Lee"" on one of his training brothers or Segu(I would have used her dinner bowl for a toilet).Maybe Graceffo is irreverent, but if you are curious how well Americans get on in Asia, this is precisely the read for you. Antonio Graceffo gives us a good look at how we as Americans travel--all out, looking to do the undoable, and we won't take any sh-t."
5,Strange but it inspired,"For Years I have owned this book, and for years Ive been looking through it, finding new things that fit me at the time. This is a book that GROWS with you. The book is sectioned off into 5 parts - dispair, liberation, creativity, new jeruselum, and godhead. Each section is full of stories, poems, quotes and art that relate to the subjects mentioned. Each crevice and space of the book has some sort of creative addition. Each time I have read this book, it seems to relate more and more, but that is because there is something in this book for everyone. I defidently recomend this to ANYONE who has an interest in the oddities of life, and the inner meaning to existance. If you are, you will keep reading this book for years to come."
4,Useful and not too technical,"Fairly good introduction to DNA for genealogists. The science is good, but the numerous text insets intrude into the flow. Many of these inserts extend onto additional following pages, adding a little more to the interruptions into the learning process. A better choice may be Megan Smolenyak's book, ""Trace Your Roots with DNA."""
3,Not as Approachable as Knuth's Other Writings,"To a reader interested in the analysis of algorithms, this book doubtlessly contains a number of very thorough analyses, with some interesting correspondence about the origin of complexity O()-notation and the term ""NP-hard"" thrown in.As a reader more interested in Knuth's work in general, I must admit that, despite having advanced degrees in CS and a quite decent math education, I found myself unable to follow the heavy mathematics employed, and ultimately, the problems analyzed were not interesting enough to me to make me spend the effort to follow it. One of the chapters was titled ""A Trivial Algorithm Whose Analysis Isn't"", and this probably sums up why I'm not entirely enthusiastic about this book and about the field of algorithm analysis in general.Knuth wouldn't be Knuth if he didn't throw some lighter material in as well, and chapter 2, ""The Dangers of Computer Science Theory"", was quite amusing."
4,Sarah & Legrand,"If you are looking for those rare and brilliant moments in Music, this certainly is one of those moments. Sarah, with her superb voice and Legrand, with his great compositions and arrangements. If you can have it, don't miss it."
3,A Tentative Debut,"Tinny production and the band's own tentativeness mar this set. That said, there are several very fine moments--Neil's ""Out of My Mind,"" ""Burned"" and especially ""Flying on the Ground Is Wrong"" are light years beyond his band mates' contributions on the original (mono) portion of the set. That's not to negate the other songs, mind you, but ... there's good and then there's **good**. As if taking the bait, Stephen Stills' ""For What It's Worth""--added after it became a hit, and included in the ""stereo"" portion here--is as perfect a ""protest"" song ever recorded, transcending its origins (the Sunset Strip riots) by never saying what, exactly, is going down. Of note, the mono set restores the much-bootlegged ""Baby Don't Scold Me"" to its proper place (it was dropped in favor of ""For What It's Worth"" after that single became a hit)."
3,The mono mixes make it worthwhile for Springfield-o-philes,"It's interesting to hear the mono mix the group did with this first album. Even on a cheap CD player the sound is rich and well-blended. The CD does include ``Baby Don't Scold Me,'' contrary to Aizlewood's puzzling review for Amazon, and while it's a good enough song it's easy to see why it was the one sacrificed. It repeats other elements of the album. The extra photos are a hoot. Sort of psychedelic/thrift shop on impossibly young-looking band members."
4,Vintage,Some good tunes in here from several musicians at the very beginning of their long careers. Brings back a lot of wonderful memories from an era jam packed with outstanding music.
4,good beginning,"This debut Buffalo Springfield album is a fine start. While I wouldn't claim that it is among the truly great debut recordings, it is a fine disc. Stills and Young were already demonstrating their formidable potential, and Richie Furay's vocals have got to be among the most underrated in all of rock music at that particular point in time. My favorite tracks are probably Young's haunting ""Out of my Mind"" and ""Burned"", but there is nothing embarassing here. Strongly recommended."
2,"OUTDATED, OVERRATED ALBUM",Nothing here can stand the test of time. IT's all about a bunch of hippie musicians doing crazy rock songs. At least Neil Young already shows his talents here. The rest is [...junk]
1,Buffalo Springfifeld,"I truly like Buffalo Springfield, and used to see their concerts often. This album has ""For What It's Worth"" on it, and that's the ONLY song I recognized. The rest of the songs can disappear forever as they're short of terrible. Their other albums are great."
2,A start.............but a weak one,There is no reason why you should feel compeled to buy this album. The song for what it is worth is the only bright spot on a terrible album. I don't feel that this album is a good representative of Neil or Steve. Not everyone was always good.
5,Cruisin with Gwyneth Patrow and Huey,Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic in Duets with the hit song Cruisin. Please everyone ask that she sing more or has an album developed.....
5,great stuff!,we have enjoyed our PEK wine preserver. The argon gas cartridges are handy easy to store and priced right at amazon.com the PEK system does a great job preserving your open bottles of wine for home consumption
1,Not to my taste.,I bought these based on reviews here and elsewhere. I don't like the scent. Its a personal thing so that's why the one star for the most part.Otherwise if you LIKE the scent (kinda smells old mannish) then fine... but still consider the shipping fee!!!!
4,HE SAYS 3 1/2 stars (option not available),"IT SPRAYS OUT TOO MUCH FRAGRANCE AT ONCE, MY DAD WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THE MIST TO BE FINER.IT'S AROMATIC. SMELLS GREAT. USE SPARINGLY FOR PERFECT INTENSITY AND YOU WILL BE ALRIGHT. OTHERWISE IT'S TOO STRONG. IT GOES A LONG WAY. MY PARENTS STARTED NUZZLING AFTER MY DAD PUT IT ON. MY MOM PUT ON MORE ON HIM AND THE NUZZLES AND KISSES CONTINUED. (WRETCHES) SO YEAH IT ENCOURAGES TOO MUCH PDA... OH MY GOSH...LOL"
3,"Bod's version of Armani ""Code""","It winds up that I am not fond of the musty note of this OR Armani code, but for those that are, this is a cheap and fairly good alternative. It is strong, lasts forever, and is a projection ""monster"".However, these bod sprays do have a certain ""cheap"" character which may be due to artificial components, so you might want to try Armani code first (on your skin, and smell it over hours) as it might hold up better. I will say that these colognes are infinitely superior to any ""Axe"" product, which will burn people's noses from a great distance. If your teenage son has bought into thinking that Axe will get women to chase them naked on the beach, you might transition them to this before buying them a ""real"" cologne. Consider it scent methadone to the flat out heroin addiction of Axe stink."
4,Bart Saint Bart,"This is a great product. BodMan isn't an apt enough name for this particular brand of body spray. Might I suggest ""Teenage Girl Magnet."" Boo-Ya-Ka-Sha!"
5,bod,smells very much like Armani Code. just got it for Christmas so have no clue on staying power. anyway it is so cheap if you need to keep applying it. 5 stars for smell.
3,great cd,i love this cd always loved the blues from this period. but i was dismayed to find that the cd holder or cover was bent and the plastic part that holds the cd was cracked in half. this is the first time i ever found any defects coming from amazon. i don't understand how the cd can be ok not a blemish and the cover can be bent in half at some point. i expect this when buying used cds not new.
2,One dimensional character...,"It's not the worst thing I've read, but it's certainly towards the bottom. The main character is completely one dimensional and has absolutely no personality which leaves you with a boring book and no desire to continue reading further. It looked neat and I really wanted to like this series but after buying the first 3 books I realized I was wasting my money."
4,Who Said?,"Who said clean versions coudn't be good. OKay, so the rap part was taken out of BEEP ME 9! No big deal. This is a clean classic. I love it. Perfect summer music."
1,I have the explict version....,"...and it is okay, but totally not some of her best work, it is kinda stupid in my opion, because I mean, ""BEEP BEEP, Who got the keys to the jeep, vroooooom"" how stupid can you get? ..."
3,more inspirational than informative,"Rather than being the guide I expected to writing and publishing magazine articles, it reads like the text of a motivational speech of the same name. Though Dr. Shaw's own review suggests her book is useful for writers who want to promote a book, the book itself doesn't even discuss the topic, let alone offer insight. The one useful gem I did pick up from this book is that if she can be successful as a magazine writer, she's right, anyone can do it. If you're looking for motivation, this is your book. If your looking for information, try elsewhere."
5,Excellent book for writers at all levels,"Publishing magazine articles and seeing your name in the byline can be a lot of fun, but to be successful you must also treat it as a business. Many books today examine the writing aspects of submitting articles to magazines, but few really look at the business side of the process. Dr. Eva Shaw covers these business topics in a way that blends them into the writing process. Finding article ideas, analyzing the publications, contacting editors, writing the query, doing the research and submitting the articles are all discussed in a common sense, pragmatic way. This is a ""must have"" book for any writer's bookshelf.Joseph Berke-- Freelance Writer/Photographer/Seminar and Workshop Instructor"
4,Good reading for novices and professionals alike.,"Eva Shaw has done it again. In ""The Successful Writer's Guide to Publishing Magazine Articles"" she has presented good practical information in a clear, concise and entertaining manner, much like she does in the classroom. Shaw has a unique ability in that she is able to pass on good information while, at the same time, build confidence in the reader. Her methods are tried and true, and her information makes good common sense. This book is good reading for novices and professionals alike."
5,Magazine Article Writing Simplified,"This book is a must for anyone intersting in writing magazine articles and selling them. Dr. Shaw writes as if she is sitting down and talking to you directly. She goes over magazine writing terminology,ie; blitz, fillers, spec. She also advises timelines for submissions, how to approach an editor, how to gracefully handle a rejection by submitting another idea. Thre is a breakdown of different types of articles, query writing musts, and research tips and reference guides. The author does not however lure you into believing that this is an easy job. She constantly stresses that persistence and organization is the key to writing and publishing successul articles. I took Dr. Shaw's on-line magazine writing class and having this book is like an on-going class where one is constantly getting personal instruction."
5,A great resource packed with practical advice on freelancing,"I am a new freelance writer and recently read Eva Shaw's book. It was informative, motivational and easy to read. I sent out a batch of queries the day after finishing the book, following its advice to the letter. Lo and behold, it worked. One week later I had sold my first feature story. The best part about the book is that it gives realistic, practical information that anyone can use. It tells you how the market REALLY works, and how YOU can break in. Check it out."
5,An Essential Tool for Writer's,"After delving into the first chapter, I knew I could write for magazines. After finishing the book, I kicked myself for not doing this long before! Eva Shaw answered all of my questions in one book. It has given me the tools to turn my writing into income other than just a hobby! I recommend this book highly to all aspiring freelance writers!"
1,This should be a ZERO rating,The best review posted by Alan F. Knox means that he never watched the DVD before he wrote his review. There really isn't a complete song performance by Pink Floyd on this DVD. I bought three for Christmas presents and now I will have to call each person I had Amazon send one too and apologize to them. Luckily I did send the new Pulse DVD as well which is superb. I think Alan F. Knox should post a retraction of his review unless he still hasn't watched the DVD.
4,Newsflash people...,"Those of you that said that this is Pantera's first or debut album are sooo wrong it's not even funny. Ever heard of ""Metal Magic"" or ""Projects In The Jungle""?I didn't think so. And you call yourselves fans.This is a great album but by far not their first. Get your facts straight."
5,One of the best major-label debuts of all time,"Pantera, after releasing several records that were more in the vein of pop rock than heavy metal, proved they could shred with the heavyweights after releasing ""Cowboys From Hell"". From the opening title track to the last, The album is a no-holds barred attack on the senses. The album not only shows the future of how heavy metal should sound, but also the influences that made it what it is. Pantera began their climb into heavy metal stardom, and by the looks of things, will be at the top for a long time to come."
4,Pantera Dominates,"Cowboys From Hell is one hell of an album. Phil Anselmo is still kind of stuck in the hairband era with his occasional high pitch squeals, but still gives a damn good performance. Dimebag Darrell or then known Diamond Darrell loads up on some insane guitar work along with his brother Vinnie Paul on drums. Rex is an excellent bassist even though sometimes you cannot hear his instrument through all the chaotic metal of ""Cowboys From Hell"", ""Primal Concrete Sledge"", ""Domination"", and ""The Art Of Shredding"". To the beautiful metal ballad of ""Cemetary Gates"".There is no denying that Cowboys From Hell is a revolutionizing record from a very unique metal band that was only giving us a taste of what was yet to come."
1,"Yep, it's a dud pressing.","Like many others have said, Cowboys From Hell has some skipping issues. My copy skips horrendously during Medicine Man. What a let down. I definitely expected more for $24."
3,HERE WE COME,"Pantera is one of those bands you either love or hate. Prior to Cowboys from Hell they spent many years honing their chops on classic Priest inflicted speed metal. Cowboys From Hell virtually sheds all indication of this, inciting many to accuse them of hiding their past.The main problem with CFH is Terry Date's flat production, a Pantera trademark. The riffs seem heavy enough, but annoying trebley guitar tones and virtually nonexistent bass bogs them down. Vinny Paul is a decent drummer but hardly the skin-master many make him out to be.This aside, there are some killer songs here. Cemetary Gates is a great ballad, and probably Pantera's finest moment. Domination and Cowboys From Hell showcase Dimebag's aggressive playing, but much of this CD leaves something to be desire."
4,An excellent example of bone-crushing metal.,"This CD shows anyone the raw power that Pantera is made of. In a world of one-hit bands playing just to make a quick buck, Pantera has always gone against the grain and stayed true to their fans. This debut shows why Pantera is unlike any other metal band.The flawless melodies on ""Cemetery Gates"" and the pounding drum and axe-work on ""Cowboys From Hell"" show how a band can be diverse yet still rock harder than any other band around. If you don't own this CD, don't call yourself a Pantera fan."
4,One of the Best!,"Pantera's debut on a major label proved successful. The album is much different from all the other albums pantera has put out. It resembles early Megadeth, and Metallica. The riffs are fast and the solos are amazing. CFH shows that music can be heavy, fast, and still remain different. CFH also contains what is considered Pantera's best song, Cemetery Gates. It's as close to a ballad the guys have ever gotten to. The rest of the stuff on the album is some of the fastest music I have ever heard. Definatley worth buying."
5,time for primal concrete sledge!!!!,"as fresh as the day it came out, ""cowboys..""will be showing newcomers how its done for years to come. ""cemetary gates"" was the first song i heard of pantera .this was somthing quite new.the sound bursted w/ rich presence .heavy,groovy,very technical & somwhat soulful.so i bought it .every song is nothing short of amazing .i heard all pantera albums prior to this one sucked ass.what happened here ? did they strike a deal w/ the devil or somthing? i wish they would re issue some of those old pantera albums so i could be the judge.after this how bad could they be?"
4,timeless artistic quality,"For a band to produce such an awewsome album, when the genre of heavy metal was waning, is in itself is amazing, Pantera gave us all a wake up call to the fact that metal and music are and can be, one and the same. You owe yourself to check this recording out...."
5,Great 90s Thrash,"This is more ""groove"" but there is enough thrash metal in here. Pantera is one of the greatest metal bands in the 1990s and one of the most well known in rock . these guys really can rock hard!"
5,Why do you people call pantera panterrible?,"Pantera is not the worst band these people have eve4r heard. If you want bad metal check pig destroyer. Well this album is kick ass. It is better than Pantera's other releases. People also say Dimebag sucks, but they are wrong. Dimebag is a good guitarist, but he is not the best I have ever heard. Well this album has great trakcs like the title track, cemetary gates, clash with reality and domination. for you people who even hate thia pantera album, then you are p*ssies. This is their weakest album."
3,Earplugs Please,"The albums music is really heavy, the vocals just don't fit it though. It's like Metallica with David Lee Roth singing. The end of Cemetery Gates and all of Shattered are just completely annoying thanks to Phil trying to sing. Buy it for the music but not the vocals."
2,Awful,"This is the worst sounding remaster I have ever had the displeasure of listening to (even the Megadeth remasters aren't this bad!).The cymbals/hi-hats are way too prominent in the mix, they sound like small blasts of white noise, and the bottom end is overly boomy (as on Domination) to the point of losing punch.Stick with the original mix of Cowboys From Hell. Remaster FAIL."
4,Excellent Debut Album,"The band obviously didn't find there own, unique sound until ""Vulgar Display..."", but Pantera's debut album is still great. Between the crucnchy guitar riifs and Phillip Anselmo's screams, the band sounds very similiar to early Metallica. The title track opens with one of the best riffs the band has ever had. It is very similiar to classic Metallica, but it's still awsome. Still, the true excellence on this album comes with the track 'Cemetary Gates'. It remains one of Pantera's best songs of their entire career. It's not just a traditional metal song like most of the tracks on this album. It also has one of Dimebag's finest solos. His complex playing is displayed wondefully in that song. As a whole, this album isn't as great as Pantera's later albums, but it is essential for any fan of the band, or anyone who likes solid heavy metal. If you want Pantera's best, check out ""Vulgar Display Of Power"" and ""Far Beyond Driven"". Still, you won't be dissapointed with this album."
1,Bad mastering...,I love this album.This new mastering is BAD.The high range boosted & the compression took away the snare and bass drum.AVOID.
5,The hard hitting debut from one of the premier metal bands,"When Pantera released Cowboys From Hell, they started a trend that would eventually destroy grunge. Every Pantera album released has been worthy enough to buy and listen. Cowboys From Hell is one of those albums that you can listen to start to finish. With hard-hitting songs like ""Domination"" andthe title track will just blow you away, but then ""Cemetary Gates"" is guitarists Dimebag Darrell's best acoustic song. On the song ""Shattered"" singer Phil Anselmo's singing reaches a Rob Halford level. Vinnie Paul's double-bass drums are what kicked off the 90s with intense arena drumming. Overall this is one of the great hard rock bands of the decade and this record is their landmark. The follow-up is at the same if not higher llevel. This album is a must in any cd collection"
5,OOOO....COME ON!!!,"Pantera is one of the greatest bands of the metal world. In the 90's, i think Pantera was the top metal band of the world with Sepultura. I really never have seen the Pantera albuns that came before Cowboys, so this is where Pantera begins for me. All the songs are good, some are classics like Cowboys, Primal Concrete sledge, Psycho Holiday and Cemetery Gates. From Cowboys from Hell to The Great Southern Trendkill, Pantera dominates the 90's metal world."
3,"Contains classic Pantera material, but not their best.","This album is decent. The reason I don't like it all that much is because they wrote it in their 'conversion' years. The years being when they were converting from glam metal to hardcore metal. While this album is not glam, it contains some 'glam traces', like high-pitched squeals on Message In Blood and others. I'm not into that stuff. Don't get me wrong, there are great songs on this album like Cowboys from Hell, Primal Concrete Sledge and Cemetary Gates, but it's not Pantera's best. I'd buy Vulgar Display of Power or Far Beyond Driven or The Great Southern Trendkill before this one, because they reflect today's Pantera better than this album does. Buy the other albums before this one."
3,The weakest part is the singer,"For any fan of heavy guitar riffs, this CD is just great! Very good riffs, strong and creatives. But singer Anselmo blows the music off, trying to prove that he is a great singer. The only thing he does is scream and force his voice all along(except for Cemetery Gates)"
4,FANTASTIC,"THis is sheer metal. If the singer in this band was other than Anselmo, than it would be plain perfect !!! Anyway, even with Anselmo on board, this album is astonishing, a fantastic display of metal musicianship. One cannot believe PANTERA was into glam ( blergh!) someday..."
2,Somewhat Better....,"It's me!The Pantera critic!And I just wanted to let all of you know that they're better on this CD then the next four.There wasn't much swearing and not even a warning sticker, nevermind label.I gave 2 stars though because they can't be forgiven for their next work that followed.The guy who said that they sound like if David Lee Roth took over a great band like Metallica is correct.So don't be a fool cause Pantera isn't cool. Now excuse while I go put MetallicA on."
2,Not for everyone.,"While i am sure that real metalheads dig this album, I found it pretty lame. There is no creativity in the songwritting, the production is not happening, and the music isn't hard enough."
2,BORING!!!!!,"I started reading this book and i am a pretty fast reading but it was taking me forever. it also was interesting at all. I got to the part where Starla stole from the store where D works. I was so bored that I stopped reading it!:( Whatever! Just if your thinking about readung it, DON'T!!!!!"
1,I was very disapointed with this book.,Story line was bad. Dialog was bad. Possum child in diapers (thought it was gong to be allegorical - not)of human mother and auntie. Not a good story on any level.
5,LOVE IT,"What a funny book, especially if you like southern stories. I do, and it is funny. Try your best southern accent when reading it aloud. Great illustrations."
5,You'll love this author,Ms. Salley had such a love of children and storytelling. That's her on the cover. Her love of life shines through in all of her books.
5,Cutest Book,This is the cutest book....I loved reading it aloud to my grandkids!! I gave this book as a gift to my great grandson's preschool teacher! She loved it too!!! :-)
4,"Cute book, but did I find a TYPO?","Epossumondas is always bringing things to his mama which his ""auntie"" has given him.Towards the end of the story, his mama says:""I'm not telling you any more ways of bringing truck home"" ...""TRUCK""???Was that supposed to be ""stuff"" .. or maybe ""junk""?Yikes!!"
1,Broken pieces when taken out of box we will see how they correct this sale.,Just recieved this product in the mail and it is broken. After reading the instructions I need a DIN cage to put into the radio housing slot.So you need more than this product to finish the install. Trying to replace radio in 99 Mazda millenia which was a 2 din and I wanted to go with the bottom empty slot and a 1 din radion. I love trying to figure these things out I hate getting broken crap and not getting all I need to finish the job You recommend the correct wiring harness but nothing about this DIN cage?
3,one small complain,its nice but i have one complain...the item holder of the single din part has square openings at the end. if you put small objects it will fall through those spaces. I have to cover it and seal it with tape. im really not sure why it is designed like that.
1,damaged,"it came broken on a side...but since the radio covers it, I keep it...fits ok on my mazda protege 2001"
4,Not bad,"I added some pictures to the gallery of the setup.Overall it fits very well into my 2002 Mazda 626. No trouble installing it to the car, simply pops in.Though I didn't understand how the flaps on my radio will attach to the dash kit, so i just improvised and sorta installed it on the outside."
2,"May work, but overall cheap plastic.","I found this kit to be pretty cheap in price and quality. The rear support didn't fit the pioneer double-din radio I was installing. Installing into a mazda tribute, I found this kit to not be very secure. The idea to cut the single DIN cover to make it work for a double-din installation is not very good. I'm going to be checking out the Scosche kit."
4,Fit Great,Ordered this for a Mazda Protege 5. Fit great. The kit includes dash kit for a single DIN and a double DIN and even a rear support for the head unit. This product is better than Scosche's dash kit. I highly recommend this kit.
1,"Great Product, but package was wrong.","This din installation kit arrived broken on the left corner of the radio insert docking. It was probably broken before it was sent to me or it was broken in transit. Whichever was the case? I am very disappointed because of the improper packing. Yes, I am glad to receive the item in efficient time. The proper packing should have been in a cardboard box with cushion for accident impacts. I do not know what to assume, but result is that I have to either pay $21.00 for new or try to repair it with super glue."
3,Plateau of the plebeians,"Some potent neo-psychedelic strides aside, this comes across pretty underwhelming considering the talent involved."
3,history of scholarship neglected,"In this text of the fragments there is not a single mention of the Bywater edition or of the excellent edition, now out of print,which includes the Bywater with a translation and commentary by Patrick ? --sorry, forgot the last name; but this edition can be borrowed from major academic libraries. What's the deal?"
1,Written for managers!!!!!,I am suffering sexual harassment on the job and wanted a book that truly dealt with the ramifications from a legal and emotional perspective. I did not find what I was looking for.
3,Sent it back.,"I personally considerd it to be a bit bulky, where at the same time the hands are small. Maybe it has to be like this, but it made me sent it back."
3,Too big for me...,This watch was really BIG for my hand...It is not beautiful like the picture too. I returned it the same day. Be sure to check the dimensions before you order it!
2,Short and Sketchy,"This book was one of the earlier books I found on the subject of desert survival. As a quick guide to survival issues in North American deserts, this book is alright, but is somewhat outdated and being so short, is also very short on specifics, being more of a list of 'tips' than a complete guide to surviving in the desert. Information on such things as venomous reptiles, heat illnesses, finding water supplies, is very sketchy. The other issue is how to avoid getting into a 'desert survival' situation in the first place, which this book doesn't cover in much detail. If you have any intention of taking any serious desert trips that involve travel away from populated areas, I would instead recommend reading the Ultimate Desert Handbook by Mark Johnson or Desert Survival Skills by David Alloway."
2,never gets played with,i bought these for my son when he was about a year and he never cared for them. when they came out of the package they were new but he only played with them for about a minute. dont know if this was another product i bought when he was too old for them but they werent anything he got excited about nor did they entertain him like the other reviews said.
3,Don't make this your first Shivkumar Sharma album,"I have been a fan of Sharma's since the 1970's. Still listen mostly to ragas on cassettes and an LP from India. I was VERY disappointed in the ""Sampradaya"" album: I don't think the father and son integrate very well, and I never felt the release of streams of melodic invention I expect from Shivkumar Sharma: he seems to always hold himself back in order to let his son keep up.... If you buy it now & disagree, let me know. Get ""Rag Madhuvanti & Rag Misra Tilang"" instead"
3,Sampradaya,"I bought this disc after hearing Shiv Kumar Sharma play on Shakti-Saturday night in Bombay with John Mclaughlin,which I highly reccomend.This is a fine disc but I have to say that on the second Raga the tabla player loses it as far as I can hear.He is neither playing in sympathy with or even in time with the santoors.I find he really spoils the Raga for me and I am suprised that the track made it on to the disc.Apart from that I really enjoy this disc and would have rated it higher but for some wayward percussion."
1,"Well, the beat is dope","Nice beat, but WEAK rhymes. That's always the problem with his and Made Men's songs. Also, he seems like a manufactured product since he's part-owner of The Source (if you recall, Made Men, his group, got 4 1/2 mics for Classic Limited Edition). Listen to Eminem's songs, ""Nail in the Coffin"" and ""The Sauce"" (both dissing Benzino), to understand what I'm saying."
2,A comprehensive but shallow book...,"At first look, this book REALLY amazed me. More than a thousand pages, covering about all topics with at least a minimum relation with XML. But then, when you read the book, trying to use it to understand and develop a XML based application, you discover shallow information, specially at the basics. In the first third of the book, all aspects of XML,XSL and DTD are covered, but the author seems to think its examples are too clear for a deeper explanation. Some of them really are, but there is still too much blanks left. In the second third, the DOM and SAX explanations seems to be the high point of this book. The last third, the book explores some of the existing XML vocabularies, which could be a little shorter givim some more space for the basics of the first third. This book is not a total loss. It should spend more time with the basics..."
4,Well Written XML book,"I came into this book wanting to learn XML. I came out of it with a pretty good idea how to do it. Its not too difficult, but there are areas where I wish more was said. Other than that I am using XML every day, and this book helped me do it."
3,Had to send it back,"I have to say that first off, this is a pretty good monitor. When I unpacked it, it went together very easily. There are no drivers to install. It's got a nice picture. When I turned it on it was absolutley BLINDINGLY bright. The brightness is a little uneven depending on where you sit and the angle you have it at. The color is a bit washed out. You'll have to adjust it.But unfortunatley the Auto-Config feature was broken. It kept resetting itself every time I booted up Windows, entered into and exited a game, and other instances. This is the only reason I rated it three stars rather than four.If you do get a monitor that works properly you'll enjoy it. But this was a pain to pack up and return."
5,"C'mon, it's an ice cream sundae!","Very cute costume. Will it last years? Probably not. But my six year old is thrilled and can't wait for Halloween this year. For those who live in colder climates, one major plus is that her winter jacket will fit UNDER this costume if we get stuck with a cold Chicago Halloween.Bottom line, it's a very cute costume that will definitely hold up through the day on Halloween and provides a nice departure from the typical princess and cheerleader costumes."
4,Gotcha!!!,"This trap did exactly what I needed it to do-caught the squirrel that has been living in my garage for some time now. I got tired of cleaning up it's nest (paper, cardboard, etc...) and ordered this product. Trap arrived quickly (as usual in my experiences with Amazon.com-keep it up, DON'T disappoint me). Set it that night with bait of peanut butter on a slice of wheat bread. Came out the next morning and my litte friend was waiting for me...good thing that he ate up because we were going on a little road trip. Placed trap in a cardboard box as suggested by another reviewer to calm it down-which it did. A short time and a few miles later and my little grey friend now resides in the next county. Only negative is that opening the cage to release it was tricky, but to be fair, I did have my iphone in one hand to record the moment. Bottom line...great buy and worth every cent."
5,EFFECTIVE!!,"I bought a smaller one last year... garbage. Caught about 18 birds and half dozen chipmunks, not ONE squirrel. In fact they reached in and grabbed food without tripping it. This year got the bigger one and in 2 mos I have caught 21 squirrels and relocated. I went from them emptying my bird feeders every couple of days to no problems ... btw the feeders can't be jumped on and I smear the poles with vasoline but they run, HIT them and swing til they get the food out. A great success. Went from up to 9 squirrels in yard at one time to rarely even one."
5,Works great!,"Looked at picking up one of the smaller Havahart cages, glad I went with the 7 X 7 X 24 - Large enough to trap and keep your hands away from their teeth, small enough to manage in the back of the SUV. Product works great so far - 6 squirrels trapped in the first day and a half (with still antoher half dozen at least to go). Little buggers were tearing up the yard & garden - very impressed so far & expect to have the rest of the guys relocated within the next week."
4,It works!,It's easy to get squirrels in the trap as they cannot resist a peanut butter cracker but some of them just walk out with the treat as they learn to push back against the door to open it. I try to approach the cage gently from the side with the door to make them want to go the other way and then I latch it. I then cover the cage with a towel to calm them down and away we go.
4,It works.,"The instructions could be better.The trap didn't work at first because the hook didn't engage the door release mechanism enough. Could have been a quality control issue or could have been due to some damage that happened during delivery. I had to bend the little hook with a pair of pliers which fixed it.Except for those issues, I'm happy with the product. It caught one of the more elusive squirrels that had been trying to get into our attic 20 minutes after setting out the trap."
5,Deported 2 squirrels in 3 days.,The first day I put it under my birdfeeder and had three squirrels feast all around it but not go in. So I put some fresh rose clipping all around it funneling them into the trap and caught two in two days. Worked lke a charm.
2,Muscle Builder Required,Havahart 1078 is too tough for large squirrels. They can easily retrieve the bait and make a safe escape. The trigger mechanism requires more strength than a large squirrel can provide. Choose another trap for your squirrel pests!
3,Catcher in the grass,"Cage was smaller than I thought, perhaps too small for rabbits. No luck in catching any so far, they simply eat the grass surrounding the cage."
1,Not assembled - was in loose parts in the box,The plate on the top of the cage was not secured and the spring latch wasn't even in the door grids. Tried for over an hour to put the latch in the door to create the spring - no luck.I would not suggest this trap as it was in pieces and we had to return it.I would suggest looking in the box before bringing it home to make sure it is assembled properly.
4,"Location, Location, Location","I've been trying to catch what I thought was one or two squirrels that were eating my fruits and veggies in the backyard. For the first week I was leaving the cage close to where they were doing their damage with a selection of nuts and fruits as bait. Didn't work to well.I then found a hole under the fence where they were getting in the yard. I installed the cage just in from of the hole, leaving just enough room in front for the door to close without touching the fence. Each side of the case is blocked so they cannot avoid the cage. So far since moving the case to the new location, 7 squirrels in 6 days walked in the cage. My only debate now is to decide if I will continue to drive 15/20 minutes each time to release them or start browsing the web to see if they taste good on the BBQ.So for me it was all about Location, Location, Location..."
2,Get what you pay for,This trap is very difficult to raise the release bar to free the animal without getting right in front of it. I don't know about anyone else but I sure don't want a scared and desperate animal charging me upon release. Best to pay more for a better trap.
4,Solid Entrapment Skills,Accidently ran over my brother's trap so I had to get a new one. The traps at Tractor Supply Company left something to be desired. Seemed a little too flimsy. For an extra 10 bucks I get the gauge of the wire dropped a smige and the trap protected by a box so it doesn't get kicked around. I'm two for three and those grey buggers haven't returned.
1,will not work for squirrel,"I orderd this cage to catch the squirrel which essentially ate everyting I planted. However, I am disappointed when the cage arrived. It requires a lot of force to push the panel and pull the trigger to shut the door. The force/weight is far more than a squirrel can offer, I suspect even a big fat rabbit will not easily trigger it.I return this cage immediately unpon its arrival, disappointed and continued getting all my plants and flowers ruined by the squirrel."
4,An 80's movie buff must-have!,You have to have this well endowed picture book of the best movies from the 80's decade when movies were at their best. Plenty of written words for those of you movie go-ers that like to read as well !
3,Good read for any movie buff.,"Good book, pretty cheap considering it's hardcover. Lots of large colour photos, it covers most of the major hollywood movies of the 80's ( and there sure were some great ones ) as well as some foreign movies.The introduction is a bit airy fairy, but the rest is good, makes me want to get out the movies he talks about that I haven't seen yet."
4,Good DVD quality,"I love the book ""Youngblood Hawke"", and have always wanted to see the film. When it became available on DVD on Amazon I decided to order it, despite a tad of nervousness about the recording being made on DVD-R recordable media, as I just hoped it would play on my DVD player.However, my concerns were all for naught. The DVD played beautifully, and I was finally able to see this old film in its entirety with great picture and sound quality.The film itself was a bit disappointing as Hollywood took a lot of liberties with the story, and they also ruined the ending. It certainly would make a good mini-series for TV, and I hope someone will do that at some point in the future."
2,Not the actual poems,This was a critique and write up on the poems on the early poems of Tennyson. I could not actually find the poems I was wanting to read.
4,Recomended,"If you like to read poetry this collection is essential. I particularly recommend the Lady of Shalot, which has also been set to music. Very pleasant to read poems from a master craftsman."
4,Career Girls,"A good book to read if you want to relax your mind and not think of complicated matters. The plot is interesting, though slightly unrealistic. Girl-power is in full bloom as we see the struggle of Rowena and Topaz in their respective fields to the plateau of success. The intense rivalry between the two is amusing, as one is so determined to see the other fail at all cost. Focus on the love affairs of the two women had kept the story alive.... Overall, not a bad read, and it has a satisfying conclusion."
4,Girl+Dog+Boy=Love,"A new kind of love triangle hits the singles market?Buying a chew toy to get in good with the girl's dog?Man has had dog's in the teepee for 25000 years,but it may be the women who tamed them first?There has to be some philosophy for this, becauseit begs logic.The nice guy is blue and goes to a party at which he meets a girlwho is lonely like him. Luck has it and they hit it off.But she gets a dog and a tail spin sets in:he doesn't really dig dogs.Even worse he finds out he really does like this dog....Some coffee twists later there is a happy ending."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,Don't waste your time... if you have morals then you won't like this movie. Boy meets girl who loves dogs. Boy pretends to love dogs. Girl gets a new dog boy can't stand. Boy beds girl to aggravate dog. This movie is too predictable and lacks luster and originality. Whoever thought of this plot lacks creativity. In the meantime most couples like to enjoy a good romantic comedy together but if you are female (like me) and don't enjoy another female strutting her stuff across the screen in her underwear you will not care for this movie at all.
4,I passed,This is the only material I studied. Consistently for a month I dedicated about 2 hours per day. It paid off in that I passed the College Math Clep...
5,Great Study Guide,I recently used this book to study for the College Mathematics test- since a college math course was all I needed to receive my associate's degree. I took the test on April 12th and was able to pass with no problem. Should have bought this book a long time ago. The best part of the book was the review for probability and combination problems since I did see a lot of those on the test.
4,Good book to start with,The book is really nice. It has good examples and is easy to start with. Good for self study. The exam is a bit complex though. I passes with 61.
1,Did anyone bother to proofread this before publication?!,"Many mistakes in practice problems (for example, 2 x 3 does not equal 18!) and worse, in the warm-up to the final practice for the CLEP exam. Goodness knows what is lurking in the final practice, which I haven't tried yet. Very confusing for anyone who relies solely on this text for test preparation, so keep a math genius friend on speed dial."
5,Riveting and frightening,"I found the story was compelling and well written. Once I started reading, I was unable to put the book down. The idea of biological terrorism in the US, and our unpreparedness is the thing nightmares are made of. I believe the book was right on, with how this not only could happen, but the results that would follow. I enjoyed Mr. Derby's knowledge not only of the surroundings, but the people that he wrote about. His knowledge of the subject, was obviously extensive which not only made the story more believable, but chilling.I honestly believe that Mr. Derby could be compared to other authors of this genre, and come out smelling like a rose.I for one, will be looking for more written by Ray Derby in the future."
1,Terrible,"The honeymoon is definitely over for Charles and Diana; she's bored, frustrated, and lonely. Then she meets a handsome army captain who becomes her riding instructor and then, her lover. Five years later, they part under sad circumstances.This made-for-TV movie is really awful. No attempt was made to make the actors look anything like their famous counterparts: Diana doesn't have her trademark hairstyle (or any sense of style at all), Hewitt, Fergie, and Prince Harry aren't redheads, and Charles is a foot taller than Diana. Both the trite script and the unconvincing actors are to blame for a total lack of chemistry between the lovers; everyone in the cast has the personality of a wet rag, giving the movie a completely lackluster quality.There are some beautiful, grand houses and sets as backdrops, but the story is tawdry and surprisingly tedious. It's based on a book to which Hewitt was a major contributor, so of course, he comes out a hero while Diana is an emotional mess. Not recommended."
2,Royal Romance,"Although the vendor supplied the DVD in a timely manner and the DVD was of the highest quality, the poor acting and chosen cast made it a disaster:"
2,Princess In Love,This movie had to do with Princess Dianas' life & a very personal matter. I found I was not interested in this story at all & I would not recommend it to anyone..Another way to make money on a young womens' tragic life.
4,Really smells like cotton candy,Bought this for my 9-year-old granddaughter who loves cotton candy. Amazed that it really does smell like cotton candy! She loved it.
2,Don't waste your money on this cd,"The recorded sound is terrible, even worse than it needs to be for songs recorded in the early 30s. There are much better cds of those early Skip James recordings, notably ""Complete Early Recordings"" (Yazoo 2009). Two thumbs down for this one."
5,Great times...,"Love it! Can't wait to find other games like it. Playing with a large group is great, but even playing with two people is fun!"
1,Disappointing,"I was super excited when I received the game thinking that it would be like another Clue game, but I was wrong. The game itself is fun, but you can only play it a certain amount of time before you remember each case (only 20 cases). The quality of the tokens are horrible, one actually broken when I received the game. The ""Skeleton Key"" and ""Scotland Yard"" cards are also cheaply made. To pay $16 for a poorly made game is just not worth it."
4,Happy Sleuthing!,"I am a Clue fanatic... and this game is just as good or better!! Fun, individual mysteries for you to solve by visiting places on the game board and using your common sense. My boyfriend hates these types of games because he's not very good at them.... but even HE enjoyed this game and stood a chance at winning. Great game even for just 2 people."
4,We play cooperatively,"My 8 year old and I love this game. We play cooperatively which makes for a very pleasant, quick game, filled with natural learning for both of us! It is often silly, for example it will give a ""sounds like"" clue, rather than real mystery solving, but we rate it very highly and play a lot."
5,BAD ASS F***ING SONG!!!!,"This is one of my favorite tracks from PanterA! It's from the ""Far Beyond Driven"" Album which is their 3rd major release. I'de recommend picking up the full album rather than just getting this single...but eitherway, ""I'm Broken"" is a hard ass song that'll make your grandmama cringe!! F*** YEA MOTHER F***ER!!! DRINK SOME WHISKEY, SMOKE SOME BONG LOADS, AND LISTEN TO PANTERA!!!!"
4,Love the glass. Wish there were more,I like these. I am trying to clean up my refrigerator and most of my Tupperware is round and wastes a lot of space. These are good. The allow you to see what is inside. I wish there were a few different sizes that also stacked in the cupboard when empty.
3,Looked bigger on pic,"customers dont be fool by the pic on amazon, they appear to b a med size but when u get them, i'll say u paid too much for them dont get me wrong, purex maked good products, to much for this 6 piece item."
3,very small,i thought this size is goodbut very small.dat bigone is usefulbut this small one are waste...quality is good
4,Convenient size,"The large container is perfect for storing a 1 pound block of cheese. The only down side with this product is that the lids leak badly (unlike the round storage containers). That said, I am buying more."
2,Leaks!,"I wanted to use these for packing lunches, but they can't be used for soups, stews or anything with sauce. They definitely, leak ... a lot. I'm disappointed."
4,Very nice,I just love these. They wash so well in the dishwasher and I can see what's in them in the fridge. Love them!
3,Kind of too small...,"They are so tiny that I cannot think of what I could store in them. I usually have larger amount of leftovers or other stuff I want to store in the fridge. The loaf container is much smaller than the regular bread loaf pan.However, it's made of glass, cannot beat that. And they are durable. I just have to figure what other purpose to use them for."
5,Love Pyrex,Pyrex is so durable and long lasting. I got so sick of microwaving plastic containers with them coming out ruined. Not to mention the chemicals that plastic puts into your food. For some like me Pyrex is an investment but well worth it.
5,Worth every penny!,These are the best! I bought these a few months ago because I was tired of having a million plastic containers that were getting stained and warped. I am very impressed with them. Both sizes fit great in my husband's lunch box and they are so much easier to keep clean and keep track of. I bought two sets and use them every week. They are made of thick glass and sure to last for many years! I love them.
4,The boys are growing up,"If you're expecting the same crowd-rousting choruses, youthfully pluckish lyrics of yore, you may at first be a tad put off. But hey, the boys are in their 40s, and are showing appropriate maturity without sacrificing catchy hooks (""If only,"" ""Me without you"") and on-target (""Funny World""), personal (""Your Guitar"") lyrics. The music is a bit mellower, but full of great melodies, and the lyrics show introspection without being overwrought. After repeated listening, the strength of the tunes becomes more and more apparent. Overall a great album! The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because although I love Davy, I miss Leo's singing lead on a song or two. Oh well, maybe next time!"
2,I guess even the Saw Doctors can strike out eventually.,"I found none of the charm, wit and joie de vivre of the other Saw Doctors albums I love. It was just too redolent of old men sitting around being nostalgic."
5,Great Introduction Video,This was a really good video for introduction to the Spanish-American War. I used this video with my 10th grade American History students to introduce the war. The video provided a nice overview of the main events and kept my students attention with a better than average mix of actual footage and reenactment. The length was perfect for introducing the topic at approximately 20 minutes.
5,The BEST Digital SLR!,"I received the Olympus E-300 (EVOLT) for Christmas and I am extremely happy with the camera's performance. The look, the feel, handling, image quality and the many, many features are just what I was looking for in a DSLR. The focal plane dust removal system is unmatched by Canon and Nikon. The imager chip used is the Kodak KAF8300CE, a high performance CCD. Since one of my intended applications is astrophotography, I am interested in the ultimate in performance from my DSLR. I would recommend this DSLR to anyone interested in having the best!The purchase was from Adorama by way of Amazon."
5,Very pleased!,"As a long time Olympus I'm very pleased with the company's digital SLR. I own OM1, OM2 and OM4T film SLRs, but the E300 is going to cause all of these cameras to gather dust. The feel of the camera is solid, the turn on time is almost instantaneous and the focusing is lightning fast. The photos I've taken so far have been excelent in detaila nd color accuracy. I've blown one shot up to poster size with no problems.The downloading software is nothing special, but get a card reader and don't even be bothered with the software driven downloads.I recomend the E300 to anyone that is serious about their equipment and wants accurate and highly detailed photos. It's a steal at the current price."
5,THE BEST SLR AND THE BEST LOOKING CAMERA I HAVE SEEN!,"Before, I bought the E-300,I looked at the other SLR camera's and was impressed by some of them. But, not as impressed by the E-300. The E-300 caught my eye by it's looks and it's functions. Also, all things it can do! Plus it was easy to use! When I first started using the camera I was ""VERY"" impressed by how well the pictures were coming out. I am pretty impressed with the E-300! I am ""GLAD"" I choose this camera and I would not trade it in for anythings else."
2,"YIKES! TYPOS, TYPOS, and MORE TYPOS!","I have read all of Alexandra Sellers's books in paperback, and I've enjoyed them all. Imagine my surprise when I purchased them in the Kindle book format and found so many typos that it was difficult to get through the books. I'm not sure who is responsible, but someone surely has to proofread these books before they are sold. Since Amazon or the publisher has decided to charge almost full price (and in some cases full price) for Kindle books, I feel that we readers are entitled to more than a glorified rough draft. I'll admit that I have found errors in other Kindle books, but Seller's books on Kindle have been the worst. SOMEONE needs to proofread these books. Putting them out there full of errors is cheating the readers, as well as the author, and I resent it. I gave this book a low rating because of all of the errors."
5,sheds some light,"This was a great look at an often-times overlooked element of WW2. It was honest, and gave an acurate look at resistence in Warsaw. A great read. Would be excellent for a student looking to get a glimpse of the everyday person's existance during that awful time..."
2,disappointing book,"I ordered this based on reviews by other readers and the fact that Amazon showed it on a page with the likes of Alan Furst. Fans great historical, e.g. Furst, will be disappointed by the sloppy amateurish writing in this apparently self published work."
1,Streets of Warsaw,Needed an editor (grammar mistakes!)and spellcheck (Misses for Mrs.) big time. I am a former English teacher and cringed at the elementary school mistakes. The only thing that kept my interest was my interest in European history during WWII.
5,Excellent! But a note to PS2 Owners...,"This game was beyond excellent, I'm 32 and I love playing this. I've pulled it out at family gatherings and my cousins (ages 10-32) have a blast! Definately more challenging than Parappa, but also more fun in a lot of ways.NOTE: For PS2 owners, buy a PS1 memory card, your PS2 will take it and you can only save PS1 games on a PS1 memory card. I usually keep one of each in the PS2 ports, since it doesn't matter where the card is to use it."
4,Um Jammer Lammy will bring you to your knees,"I really liked this sequel to Parappa the Rapper. It still has the paper-thin 2-D graphics but that's what gives the game a fun, cartoonish feel. But now you're slinging a guitar. This game will keep you on your toes for hours and your fingers on the buttons for eternity. It's a lot harder than Parappa but gives you more freedom. You have several effect peddles at your disposal which you use to change the sound of your guitar. Using different kinds and holding different buttons will gurantee a funky sound. If you're coordinated, buy this game. You'll need that dexterity! It's also a great party game. Buy it!"
4,"Well, ha ha ha...","... A lamb playing a guitar!(Not a swipe at another reviewer, honest). It held me and my cousin's interest for almost several hours. Its fun, challenging, the graphics(out-dated 2D) have a certain goofy appeal and the controls are good. Since I don't own a Playstation(A Nintendo player since I was 6, baby!) trying to watch the screen and hit buttons that I'm not familiar with was hard. But after awhile I got it. Only one level has a bad song and thats the one with the insane, midget pilot. Even though the songs aren't stuff I'd want to listen(some are so '80-ish and stupid), taking part in them is a lot of fun. Single player is fun, less fun than multi-player though. I wish there were some hidden stages or something along those lines, but still, its fun."
3,Great Quality!,"Fresh still in the plastic, brand spanking new! Very hard to find this game at that price anywhere else. Thankyou!"
4,it rocks oldschool,"All the fun of Parappa the Rappa with some weird, fun guitar licks. It's definitely not an easy game, making you mash buttons rhythmically while attempting to add your own stylings to get better ratings. But if you like the idea of Guitar Hero with a good variety of rock genres, very trippy storyline, and way more room for freestyle shredding (even if it is with a standard controller), this is the right game to get. Not a lot of levels, but you can go head to head in co-op mode with a buddy or cpu. The songs are catchy, and it's well worth the price for several hours of entertainment."
2,Good rental game,"I would rent this game. It takes no skills what so ever to beat it. Maybe it just came naturally to me, or maybe I'm just to critical but this game is not worth buying. In my opinion this game would only appeal the the 8-11 age range and even then would they only play it once or twice."
1,"Terrible book, don't waste your time","Don't even bother wasting your time with this book. The author is way out in left field. The first review has it right, those other reviews must've come from a biased source like friends/colleagues/family."
5,Excellent,"I've been a fan of Feeder for a number of years and absolutely love this record. An outstanding mix of music with Radiohead, Beck of Foo Fighters all being obvious influences."
3,Eh.......,"This album could also receive two stars (if they had two and a half, that's what I'd give it). Most of the songs are boringly unoriginal and they sound the same. However, in some aspects it makes up for that. ""Suffocate"" is indeed a great song. ""Cement"" and ""High"" are also good examples of what the rest of the album should have been. It comes pretty close to being decent, but not close enough."
5,Who are these guys? Who cares? The album is great anyway!,"I bought the CD for 1.99 because my brother said he had heard their release, Cement, a few times and they sounded alright. I bought it and listened to it, and was amazed. A band I had never heard of played a variety of great pure rock songs(Tangerine, Cement, Radiation, Forgive) and some great soft rock songs(Suffocate, High) blended to gether in the form of an album that has stayed among my favorites ever since I bought it. The Feeder boys deserve more fans than they probably have now, but if they keep making albums like this, they should get more."
3,"cool, but not 2 cool!","I heard a few of the track samples at this very site. Then I went out and bought the CD. I listened to it a couple of times and now it is collecting dust at the back of my CD rack. OK, it may not go exactly like that. There are a couple of great tunes on this record, tracks such as: High, My perfect day and polythene girl. the other songs are ok, but don't put me into that ""must listen to CD"" trance that I do with other reacords. Some of the time ( track 3) these guys tend to sound a bit like a rocked Beatles, which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but I find this unorigional. If you like soft rock, this is the CD for you, but if, like me, you like something faster, and heavier, look elsewhere."
4,One of the best of 98.....,"Great stuff here....hard edged pop with loud guitars and hook laden, catchy choruses. To these ears they sound alot like Fig Dish. Highly recommended if you like Everclear's Sparkle, mid period Husker Du, etc....."
3,4 songs make this CD,"I bought this CD because the song ""High"" from the ""Cant Hardly Wait"" soundtrack kept haunting me with its guitar reminiscent of Oasis. The emotion in this song is amazing. The lyrics are simple evocative with a hint of melancholy ""as I cant ignore a man. he turned his head around, his face was all worn by the sun. I'm going ot for a while, so I can get high with my friends. I'm going out for a while, dont wait up cuz I wont be home, today."" Buy this album, especially if you enjoy, the foo-fighters, bush, and a little smashing pumpkins. You might be a little dissapointed by that nagging feeling that you heard these songs before ( because I admit, the cd is a tad unorigional) but it is definetly worth its price. Theres a little something for everyone here. I liked it, even though I never get past the first half. Does that make sense? Hmmmmm."
3,Generic but effective tabletop mic stand.,"With no reviews to go on, I thought I'd take a chance on the Hisonic Deluxe Tabletop mic stand. At around $15 dollars, the risk seemed acceptable and what I received was a generic but adequate desktop mic stand. The metal tripod base feels fairly sturdy and the legs lock firmly into an open or closed position. The central shaft, which was easy to adjust and tighten, feels generally secure. The mic clip which is included feels extremely cheap and flimsy. You are able to tighten the pivot with a screw driver, but the actual clip itself feels loose and insecure and I do not recommend using it. Can't say I'm crazy about the overall presentation or feel of the stand, but it will get the job done."
3,the hand can't be tighten,it is a good one. I bought 2 but one of them has the hand loosen. can't be tighten at all
3,"Solid, but small.","It's decent, solid, but really short. almost too short to use at a table. Use a longer mic with this one."
1,Are you kidding me?,"The top doesn't even fit the metal part. To prove that I'm not stupid, I asked 4 people. It just simply does not fit. Buy this if you want to laugh."
5,now that's some ska,"To most Montrealers during the ska explosion of the late 90s, the Kingpins were the only band that mattered. Reel Big Fish, Save Ferris, Less Than Jake... give me a break - this album, along with their breakthrough Watch Your Back, was authentic ska. After ten years of producing kick-a** ska, the Kingpins have folded and the remaining members have formed the genre spanning ""Lo and the Magnetics"". R.I.P. to a Montreal institution who could hold their own in any venue.Now, as for the album itself - it follows the same vein as Watch Your Back in terms of style, but to me it is slightly more interesting and pays homage to the different directions ska has gone. Most songs are pure ska with a mix of punk's energy, while a couple slow things down some to explore rocksteady and reggae. This has alot more in common with the Specials and (dare I?) the Skatalites than it does with their Third Wave contemporaries. In other words, this is the real deal."
1,CELLET ELITE NOT PREMIUM,"THIS ITEM IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. IT DOES NOT FIT PROPERLY AND THE TOP KEEPS COMING OFF. I READ OTHER REVIEWS WHICH ALSO HAD RATED IT NEGATIVELY, BUT I CHOSE TO TRY IT ANYWAY. WRONG MOVE. I DO NOT USE IT AT ALL. IT SHOULD NOT BE CALLED A PREMIUM OR ELITE CASE AT ALL."
2,Lambskin Leather Case-Don't Buy,"It's too soft, therefore, when you use the adapter while the case is on the phone you have to continually pull it over to fit the adapter in the phone. It was so much trouble, I took it off and got a heavier leather case that works perfectly!"
1,didn't fit,It said it would fit razor phones but this did not fit my razor phone.So I could not use it. I did not return it because it would have cost to much to return.Now I have a new case for a phone that is just useless. I will have to go to the phone company and buy one.
3,Cellet Elite Premium Case Review,"Price was great. The case is nice looking, very soft and has cushion sewed in. The problem I found after a week or so, is that the top of the case would not stay attached to the phone while in the open position.."
1,waste of money,"This item has horrible snaps. Mine broke about two weeks after I got it, and I take care of my stuff. I would not recommend this item to anyone"
4,"Full of valuable detail, but...","The authors have attempted to add a great deal of new material, sidesprings of interest, and helpful hints that expressly helps the first time traveler to assess the place...its virtues, highlighs,drawbacks, etc. My only complaint...for which I markdown to 4 stars...is that for aging eyes and/or less than perfect vision readers, the text print is way too small, and the maps extremely difficult to read. I suppose that was done to conserve space, but I think mistakenly. When you are straining to read, attention is sure to wander away,and for a great guide book, the reader has to be kept focused."
4,great stories about teens and parents,"I loved this book for its great stories about adolescents and their parents. The dialogue can be hilarious at times as these kids struggle to understand what's happening for them in the sexual arena, and Lynn Ponton seems to understand them at every turn where their parents can't. The subjects can range from ""everyday"" performance anxieties to questions about sexual identity, to wrestling with negative outcomes of sexual activity (pregnancy, disease), to finding oneself actually enjoying the pleasures of healthy sexual activity in the context of a healthy intimate relationship.Lynn Ponton is nonjudgemental about many loaded topics. I know my own kids will benefit from my having read this book."
2,From a teenagers standpoint . . .,"Is it just me or is Dr. Ponton trying to give teenage sexuality a bad name? (Like we aren't looked down upon enough as it is!) Every chapter of this book is filled with sexual extremes, which many teens are smart enough to avoid. Dr. Ponton is not ""revealing the secret world of adolestcent boys and girls,"" rather she is describing and analyzing the problems of unaverage teenagers that would need to see a doctor like her. The experiences in this book are uncommon to the average teen and therefore are hard to relate to. Parents gain no insight into teenage sexuality from this book either.I gave this book two stars purely for the entertainment value of the anecdotes Dr. Ponton's patients presents. I hope she's paying them royalties, because their stories are the only thing selling her book."
1,"Bad Dr., Bad book","I had Ms. Ponton as my therapist when I was 16 (I'm 22 now). She told my mother confidential information about my emotions that led to a lot of fighting and problems in my family. I also found her to be self absorbed and not connected to what people my age were feeling.I have also read her books, and in one she wrote an entire chapter about a boy who loved the Smashing Pumpkins. Two things- 1- She spelled the singer's name wrong for the entire chapter. And 2- She stated that teenagers went to concerts for some sort of musical/sexual orgy...?! I can only speak for myself (and not HUGE groups of people, unlike others) but music concerts were always a religious/social/MUSICAL occasion. I felt more in tune with the divine there than anything else.She tends to believe the worst, or most extreme if you'd like, about teenagers, and her work (both writing and practice) suffer from it.Thanks for reading."
2,Focusing on the Negative,"What is it these days with authors, and society in general associating teens having sex with pregnancy, STD's and harrasment. Teenagers these days aren't as naive as you think! I know I remember everything essential in those Health classes and what my parents taught me. After learning that every action has a consequence, they should also tell you that it is an enjoyable experience! No wonder half the girls out there are freaked out of their mind when the three letter word is brought up in any conversation!"
1,Too small for the job.,"On line this appeared to be like the pump we had been using that had died. In fact it was half the size and could not pull the water out of the pool. It might be appropriate for a fountain of some sort, but not to take water off of a large pool cover."
2,One time use,"This item does the job if you are lucky twice. I guess you get what you paid for.It always cracks where the hose is attached, and guess what? There is no manufacturing warranty for that. So, this is like a one time use with no refund or warranty, then again I do not know what is the warranty for the other pump brands."
2,weak item,"i bought this prouduct on september 2010, this item has a small filter makes it block with dirt very quick, and it can't drain the small spots on pool's cover surface. it can help but not perfect."
3,Handel complete,"Here's a LOT of chamber music for a very good price. The recording performance style is rather out of date though, because musicians today have learned so much about Baroque performance practice and the instruments of that period. The performers are really excellent players, don't get me wrong. Every cut is flawless and satisfying to listen to. The dates of the recordings reveal that this set is a reprint of studio recordings that date back to a previous generation of players who didn't have the benefit of historical research into actual Baroque period performance practice. Just enjoy the music. I'm sure George Frendric would have liked it a lot!"
2,A Rush Job,"It is painfully obvious that this book was an attempt to be one of the first on the shelf following the release of .NET. It does introduce some useful differences in .NET and VB6, but there are tons of typographical and grammatical errors that make reading it difficult at times. I am a software developer, but I also took a few English classes along the way."
3,Gee whiz .NET book,"This ""gee whiz"" .NET book is based on Beta 2. It is a great intro to OOP theory, but it is not necessarily a good starting place for learning VB .NET programming in the real world."
2,General Overview For General Reading,I bought it and would have preferred more detail implementation issues. I feel that this book doesn't really provide me with any more information than I could get off of MSDN or by simply pressing the 'F1' Key.Consider purchasing if you are a beginner but reconsider if you have any significant experience or implemenations.
4,Very Good,"I really liked this book, i think it couldn't have been a lot shorted, but overall it is full of very valuable pieces of information for all church leaders!"
5,"new ideas for what ""church"" might look like","I recommend this book to everyone who is tired of the institutional church. Even if someone doesn't want to start a house church, or be quite different, this book helps to challenge the need to always do things the same way. Do we really need a building? Paid staff? How can the church adapt to a post-Christian world? The Church is now in the midst of buildng a new style of church, a new re-formation, and this book offers lots of possibilities as we think and pray this through."
4,The Shaping of Things to Come,I really enjoyed what the writers had to say concerning the topic. I did think some of their vocabulary was a bit difficult at times. I think the normal reader would like words that are easier to pronounce. They made very good points concerning our culture and reaching them with a differnet approach.
5,Ancient / Postmodern Christianity at It's Best,"This book paints a beautiful picture of the emerging western culture that stands on thorough biblical exegesis, theological reflection, historical precedent, and cultural insight. It's required reading for any student seeking to gain a better grasp of the nuances and opportunities of contemporary culture and Christianity. BUT BEWARE!!! After reading it, I found myself personally convicted that I could no longer continue on in the institutional context of parish ministry that's defined my vocation for more than a decade. It wrecked me in the most liberating of ways and I hope it does the same for all who read it."
5,"A ""must"" for the student of the Second World War","I found the translation of the Soviet General Command Staff Study ""The Battle for Kursk 1943"" to be the best source of material on this pivital battle of WW2. Glanzt and Orenstein have done a masterful job in retaining the truely important information, while filtering out the the Soviet propaganda that usually creeps into Soviet material.The serious student would be well advised to pay paticular attention to the sections dealing with air operations, engineering support, and command and control sections.The maps and tables detailing positions and correlation of forces were paticularly informative.The only critism that I would offer is that the maps need to be expanded. Althought the editors did a good job, in relation to other military histories, they could greatly improve their work with the addition of a large fold-out map detailing the area under study."
3,Book review,"I'm not familiar with the author or his other work. I found the storyline hard to follow. So, I gave up."
3,Doesn't take a lens cap!,"While the lens hood appears to be quite sturdy and it does look quite nice, unlike the similar rubber hoods it unfortunately doesn't have threads for clipping on a lens cap (or screwing a filter into it) which means that you won't want to store or transport your camera with this hood attached."
1,"Agree - not small, and not Jonathan Paul",These glasses are not small - in fact my husband tried them on and they looked large on him. They are also NOT Tortoise framed or Jonathan Paul design. I should have returned them.
1,Not ver Stylish,I didn't like the way they looked on me..ended up returning them. Spend the extra and get the better pair
3,Desires?,"Former erotic photographer who dreams about the beautiful women she had shot in the past in between scrubbing the walls & floor & counters of an empty house. None of the dream sequences were shot for this as I had seen a number of them elsewhere. It was an excuse to put them all on 1 dvd. Crissy Moran was my favorite. All shoots are soft core, some of them were edited to make them so."
3,"Buy this for Nursery tales, not for bedtime","It is misleading for this book to be titled, ""It's Bedtime!"". This is a good collection of some classic nursery tales, but it doesn't have anything to do with bedtime because the stories weren't written to lull a child to sleep.This book retells Goldilocks and the Three Bears, The City Mouse and the Country Mouse, Little Red Riding Hood, The Little Red Hen, and The Three Little Pigs. The illustrations are very pleasing. If you want to get an idea of how pretty the illustrations are, search for the illustrator to see her other work.This is a good collection of some classics, I'm glad we have it. But be warned the first two of the little pigs, in ""The Three Little Pigs"", get eaten in this retelling. They, of course, don't show it, but it is retold that way. Retelling ""The Three Little Pigs"" this way is more violent then I like."
2,Misleading Product,"I purchased this book to introduce our 3 year old to the keyboard, beyond his pushing of buttons and fiddling with keys. I myself took lessons when I was younger and can read sheet music easily. I though this book would have more directions for teaching young students, which I could follow easily. I was wrong. The instuctions in the book do not flow. There seems to be steps missing or complete sentences missing. Perhaps for a piano teacher this book is fine, as they would know how to read between the lines. For a parent looking to share a learning experience, I suggest looking for another book."
3,"Good for beginners, not adequate for an indepth read","This book was easy to read and to follow, had a number of helpful illustration and provided an fair amount of information pertaining to the foundation of the Empire and the running of both Rome and the provinces. While this book would be excellent for novices in the field of Roman antiquity, it was not an adequate read for any student of the ancient world. The lives of emperors were summed up in a few pages (usually around 2-5, some as short as 1/2 of a page), the governing of the country was presented in a superficial manner, and the general history was bland and without depth. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn the 'basics' of the Roman Empire, however, more serious scholars should look elsewhere."
2,Out of Date,This book is very out of date. We had to use it for Women's Health for the FNP track. I have almost 5years of experience in Labor and Delivery and was shocked our school would recommend such an out of date text. There has to be better options. I checked out an AWHONN book from the school library and it was much more helpful. The information on each topic is minimum and insufficient to learn from. Recommended treatments are out of date and have changed significantly in many situations. They are also not specific enough. OLD OLD OLD! It may work for the lay person just trying to learn a bit about the patho behind women's care and health issues.
3,Book Purchase,"Book not in the best of shapes, but quick delivery and hassle free transaction. Great vendor overall."
5,AWESOME HOT FUNK!!!!,"This is probably one of Grover Washington's most creative albums in his brilliant career! Overlooked and under-rated compared to his later (more commercialized) cds, this one was produced by the prolific Creed Taylor and arranged by the multi-talented Bob James. Every song is a full-bodied experience.Recorded in 1975, this cd went to #1 on the Soul Charts and the Jazz Charts. Amazingly it also went to #10 on the Pop Charts. The title song was played quite often and the opening cut ""The Sea Lion"" made it to #1 on the Disco Charts. Grover had never been more free-spirited! A must have for Grover fans and/or those who love funky jazz."
4,Feels So Good...,"It's tough to compare this to ""Mister Magic."" It just can't be done! On its' own merits - I can honestly say that it's an enjoyable effort by Mr. Washington! Get yourself a copy and enjoy! Four stars!!"
3,Grover Washington Jr - Feels So Good,Classic real fusion; waaaay before easy listening Kenny G stuff (Sorry Kenny). The reproduction is just Ok. But hey the masters are over 30 years old.
2,"Big on dictionary, low on phrasebook","I'm going to be traveling for Lisbon very briefly and just wanted to have enough Portuguese to get by. This book has just a couple of pages of useful phrases, then it's a thorough dictionary. I would have liked to see more phrases and sentences that are likely for a visitor or tourist to need. I don't want to have to learn to conjugate verbs to say ""I'm from Canada""."
4,using pill commercials are we,"rappers sample anything from old songs, to old tv themes to even carttons and is this particular case busta used an anti drug commercial to make this hit and is a good song and is classic when busta was hitting he's falling off now lord help him."
4,Joyce's review,"I thought the book might be confusing as I read the first chapter but, as I read further, I was amazed at how the story moved flawlessly and easily from the 19th century to the 20th century. The book was throughly entertaining and I especially loved the poetry."
4,"Love, truth and commitment is honored and not debased...","I thought it would be a 'war' story. But 'The Legend of Jesse Kirk' reaches-as a legend-beyond a Vietnam tale and at heart is much more. A story of a struggle of conscience that touches on the nobility and dignity of life and the greatness of the human spirit in all its pain, mystery and grandeur. I could not figure out how it might end; in the end though, it all comes together and fits-strangely and wonderfully. An unusual story. True as death. True as life."
2,Krups 2010,"I had this unit for 2+ years and it worked very well- no problems except the pouring lip on the carafe. Yes is spilled easily. But then suddenly the whole unit just quite in the middle of making coffee and I can find nothing wrong inside. So it was a great machine, now junk."
1,No Repair Parts Available,"Sadly, Krups doesn't offer the most basic repair parts for this unit...including the plastic parts that are bound to break. They are also pretty nonresponsive, referring you to vendors that don't have the parts to offer. It works nicely for as long as it works but is quick to become a piece of junk. All they'd have to do is have a reasonable way to order a reasonable variety of repair parts...but, they simply don't."
1,Made a mistake,"I am on my third machine in 10 months. The first two leaked water, and on this one, the coffee side heating element is broke and it will not brew. I am trying to decide if it is worth paying postage and waiting for the service center to get the machine repaired. It seems the Service Center could care less if they repair the machine. Previously, I had to call Krups directly to get the service Center to respond. I bought this machine because of the ""Krups"" quality name, boy did I make a mistake. When the machine worked it did produce good coffee and expresso, but is not very dependable."
1,Coffee side broken,"DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE, I AM WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS AND FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE JUST TAKEN $200 AND FLUSHED IT DOWN THE TOILET.I bought this machine about 3 months ago, and it worked fine initially.Made good coffee, and espresso was good, although the steamer worked fairly good. Then it developed a large leak whenever the coffee maker was filled with water. I eventually took the back and bottom off to see if it was a simple fix. Turns out the plastic outlet fitting from the bottom of the water reservoir was all cracked and in pieces. A part of the plastic fitting had worked it's way into the tubing. I am on hold now to see if I can get this repaired under warranty, but honestly, probably be worth buying something else at this point. By the time I pay for shipping this, etc."
2,Broke after 1 Year,"Coffee maker side works well. One gripe is that the carafe design is severely flawed so it's impossible to pour a cup of coffee without spilling everywhere. After 1 year, coffee maker side still works but espresso & frother don't. The pump turns on now and doesn't shut off when we switch on the espresso side and the reservoir that catches drips just fills with water in a matter of seconds and floods the countertop. No espresso or foam can be produced. It's a shame because this machine made an excellent cup of espresso while it worked and we really loved how easy it is to use. The frother was not as powerful as we'd hoped so we had to froth the milk at least twice to get a nice foam for cappuccinos, but in the end they tasted great. My father owns an expensive Gaggia machine and said that the espresso from my Krups actually came out better than his. I just wish it had lasted longer. I'd expected a lot more from a trusted name like Krups and for the price of the machine."
4,Krups XP2010,It took a while to get adept with the espresso and frothing functions. There should be a note in the directions telling the user to turn off the espresso maker when the color of the liquid filling the cups turns light beige. The steamer does not make the milk quite as frothy as I would like.It's very convenient and space-saving to have the coffee and espresso functions in the same machine. The coffee and espresso produced are both excellent.
2,Not for those who like frothed milk!!!!,We bought this unit to replace an older Krups combination unit that had gotten tired after many years of faithful service. We were excited to get the unit and again have Espresso with our morning breakfast. What a disappointment. The unit was difficult to use but that would have been a minor inconvenience if it had worked as promised. The biggest problem was the frother that Krups should have been embarrassed to ship. It simply did not work no matter what we tried...inexcusable at any price on a combination unit. Second the unit would take forever to make espresso...it was practically lunch before it was finished:) We have had it for under six months and we are replacing it. What a complete waist of money!
1,AWFUL MACHINE,"I received the Krups as a birthday gift. I have used it a little over a year. I have not had any luck getting the epsresso side to work, but loved the coffee, so I kept it. It has been leaking water out onto my counter for months. I took the back apart yesterday and to my terror, as the coffee maker ran, water was running down a hose and onto the electrical wires below. THE END. VERY DANGEROUS MACHINE.I will not plug it back in. Taking the back off to see what was going on convinced me that this was one messed up machine. A true safety issue. I called customer service, ship it in and a minimum of $30 for them to even open the box, and would not give any estimate of charges. All of the wires have been soaked over time and the plating on the bottom has corroded, screws are rusted, so this has been going on for some time. I will not send it back in for repair. With a little over a year of use and only once a day, this is an outrage. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT..........."
2,SLOW,"My main complaint is that the milk frother is sad. It will heat a little, then need to be recharged and heated again. I have to do this three or four times for some lukewarm milk."
1,Not A Good Machine,"Yes, the espresso and coffee comes out good, but on the coffee pot side, the back where you put water in clicks when you open it, and sounds broken. The coffee pot leaks all over the counter when you pour water in the back and when you pour your coffee, always need to pour over the sink and visitors don;t always know this. big mess each time. you can only put the pot back straight, it doesn't fit if placed with the handle on the side. You can't make espresso and regular coffee at the same time. the espresso does take long to get warm and sometimes i heat up milk in the microwave before using the frother. Anyway, i'm keeping it because it does work, but would not recommend."
1,pretty paper weight,"crap. i am SO bummed. we bought this machine a few years ago, and i loved it, while it worked (except the crafe does spill all over). my latte-filled dreams were short lived. the espresso maker quit working (it was a day out of warranty) and i was convinced i'd be able to get it fixed. i was very wrong. krups doesn't make the valve that needs replacing. they don't support any local appliance shops and basically consider this a disposable item. never buying krups again. didn't even pay for itself. i guess i expected more out of this company."
5,Darker Than Black Volume 3,"Though the shortest of volumes, (only including 4 episodes instead of the regular 5)this volume does serve to develop one of the series most mysterious characters, Yin. Furthermore, it serves to subtly define Yin and Hei's growing relationship as partners seeing as their trust for one another is strengthened with the events of the episode. It's a must have volume of the series and gives the audience a chance to become familiarized with the characters they are dealing with. I found this volume to be absolutely beautiful."
3,for kids older than 18 months,"My 18 month old (and I) loves the square books from this series (First Words, Animals, Colors). I bought this book thinking it would provide more images that we could look at and she could read. However, this book shows images that are much more difficult to understand at her age. We'll see when/if her interest kicks in...."
3,I can't believe I don't love this book,"Eh, not our fave Priddy book. My 2 y/o likes the trucks book much better. Pretty pictures and not much else. Save your $$ and try a DK lift-the-flap book--same concept but more fun and better vocabulary."
2,It's an OK item if you have extra money,"Ok, so it does hold about 6 GB of music in one little CD player sized box, but I don't think the money was worth it. I went into buying this thing because I thought, ""Wow, I'll never need a memory card again!"" I was right, but I paid the price for it (literaly). The menu is hard to use, and when music is playing, the menu is really slow. The batteries don't last very long either. Some details of music can't be changed (like album, artist, and genre), so it makes organization of your music very hard. Because of this, finding music is even harder. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this MP3 player because, for the price, it's more effort than it's worth. I hardly EVER use mine.:)"
1,Malfunction,"I'm having big problems with my Nomad Jukebox 6GB purchased only 6 months ago because It just stopped working from one day to another. I've never dropped it so I really don't know what happened. I wrote to Creative Technical Support and they answered that I've to send it back for repairment or replacement. The point is that this is not a cheap electronic toy and I know how I've taken care of it and all of a sudden the problem appeared. I can't even power up the Nomad with or without the power supply or batteries. I don't want to send it back because now I'm not in USA and ordering another is less expensive than returning it. I fell very frustrated considering that I had ordered the acqua pac, a leather case, and an external charger with additional batteries for the NOMAD JUKEBOX. I'm thinking of buying another MP3 player in wich I hope to use these accesories. Thats why one star!!!"
5,Amazing,"Finally someone came out with the unexpected! This is really the BOMB! 6GB of Space, allowing a 100 hours of CD quality music. That's what I call expect the unexpected."
5,In a league of its own.,"Forget about memory card-dependent MP3 players. This is a new generation, a quantum leap forward at a very reasonable price. It will hold *ALL* your music, not only in MP3 format, but in WMA format (this compression tech is superior to MP3 and will supplant it) as well. Downloading from your PC is a breeze with the USB connection, and the unit's controls make individual song search & access fairly simple. The size is fine (though clearly the Diamond Rio, et al, is a smaller pkg), about what a portable (Walkman-style) CD player measures. Battery life is okay, and headphones are marginal. Its one drawback is its moderate volume on playback; if you want to really hear the music on the subway, it may not rock your world."
3,WARNING: MP3 file transfer is one direction only,"You can transfer MP3 files into the Nomad Jukebox, but not out of the jukebox. (You can, however, delete them.) Why this decision was made is hard to understand, but if you're thinking you can (for example) transfer MP3 files from your work computer to the Nomad, then take it home and transfer them on to your home computer, think again: the transfer is one way only."
2,"OK, but needs help","This is a OK unit for playback and storage, but i don't know if i would buy another one. the controls on the face are poorly stenciled with their control function, which wears off quickly making each control unreadable after awhile (built-in obsolescence?). my unit is about 4 years old (nomad jukebox-6 gig) and creative no longer supports the product. i cannot upgrade either the drivers or the playstation software (2.5) which is needed to transfer files from computer to MP3 player. so what use is this unit now? i seriously doubt i would buy another creative product."
3,Battery Hog,"My friend recommended the Nomad 6 GB Jukebox, and the I was bought by the great reviews on Amazon and CNET.COM. The rechargable batteries that come with the Jukebox drain in less than a few hours. I returned my first Nomad because I thought the battery drainage was not normal. My new Nomad still requires frequent battery charges. The large price-tag and the quick battery drains warrants a 3 stars rank.Aside from the quick battery drains, the Nomad Jukebox is a great piece of technology. If large storage space and superior anti-shock are your main concerns, go for the Nomad Jukebox. If you want mobile music go for a more battery-efficient MP3 player."
3,Satisfactory - but pricey,"I've now had this for some time. My version only has 10mb memory, which was insufficient for what I wanted but was the largest available at the time. Considering I paid something in the neighborhood of $..., and they now have a 20mb version available, I'm very unhappy an upgrade isn't available."
4,good except...,Fairly i liked this jukebox. they sent me the wrong i ordered the nomad 2 MG. but i didnt get the headphones which isnt a problem i have 2 pairs. i didnt get ne xtra batterys (...). what i liked was it took like seconds to put songs on it. playcenter 2 is VERY easy to use. thats about it i think. overall i liked this item.
5,its great,this thing is greati love it !! it so sleak and nice.. It holds so many songs...The only problem with it is the batteries.. but.... you can live with it... just buy and extra set so u have a total of 3 sets and it will last you a good 10 hours.... but this is defenatly the best mp3 i have ever had... and its beautiful too
2,Great Sound - But Dissapointed...,"This device does indeed have great sound, however I am dissapointed in it's functionality. Here is my PRO and CON list:PROS----* Good sound quality* Nice storage capacity. Hundreds and hundreds of songs.* Reasonable size given it's capacityCONS----* Battery life UNACCEPTABLE (1-2 hours, if that)* Painfully slow interface. Stop, change songs, even the volume - you are forced to wait for it to happen* Slow download from computer to device.* No ability to skip forwards or backwards WITHIN a song.I say wait for the technology to improve or get another unit that addresses these problems. I do not recommend this unit at this time."
4,"Definetly worth buying, even with the problems","As many reviewers have noted, the key problems with the Nomad Jukebox are the rechargable battery issue, booth-up time, blank air between tracks, and uploading back to computer. However, these problems are definetly outweighed by the large song capacity, sleek design, durability, and overall ""coolness"".Solution for the battery problem- purchase Radio Shack high capacity NiMh batteries and recharger and charge up batteries outside of the Jukebox. I've been getting close to the max (4 hours) by not using the Jukebox recharger.There are no real solutions to the other problems... it's annoying not to be able to upload some of your MP3's to a friends computer.. but you can save a copy of them when you rip them and share them via email/ftp download.I have to admit, the Mac IPod looks much cooler, and probably weighs less... however, who wants to use a Mac anymore? Until they make an IPod for the PC, I'll stick with my Jukebox.Definetly worth the money!"
2,Needs product inprovement,"I purchased the unit for my wife so she could enjoy her CD collection on the road.Sadly the aformentioned battery life, lack of a true ""automobile"" solution and cumbersome operating interface has reduced the gift to an expensive paperweight. The complexity is to much for her.The promissed remote, 12 volt adapter and a more sophisticated ""battery"" sollution would make this a ""contender"" for those that require a ""walkman"" type of solution.I am a bit more of a hacker and may find a use for it, but it is not a product for the faint of heart at this time.I do like the company and the ""idea"" of the product, I wish it would get better ""faster"". I would even buy another if it was improved."
4,The best MP3 player available...but...,"At a hefty cost, this player can't be beaten. The battery drain is heavy though...but other than that...a perfect piece."
2,Can't recommend this item,"While sound quality and storage capacity are quite nice, the abysmally poor interface makes this player next to useless. The keyword when using the buttons is slow! Even something simple like changing the volume to the headphones shows quite a lag, and isn't always available. Scrolling through your playlist is slow, everything is frustratingly slow. Add to that the huge number of things you can't do, and features you'd expect to be there but aren't (like delete a single track from the active queue, or play in shuffle mode) and my impulse is to junk the thing.The PC-based software for managing your playlists is also very poor, nonintuitive, and lacking in a great many simple features that would make it a lot easier to use. I wish I had the room and time to provide a complete list.On the plus side, the sound quality is very good, storage space is ample, and the device itself has a nice look, but I was very disappointed with this purchase."
3,cheap but awkward,The carseats were a great bargain and with twins that is what I was looking for but the fit is really awkward its like we are stuffing them into the seats and the buckles are awkward as well. I prob should have went with a different carseat.
5,Wunderful,When you are working with volume this bag is invaluable. The confidence to use and abuse this bag is there.
4,Night's Landing,If you like a book that starts out on the firstpage and you cannot put down until the last pagethen read this book. Carla Neggers is one of myfavorite authors. Amazon has alot of her novelsin stock - put them on your Kindle or Kindle Fire.
3,Better if Series Read in Order,"It may not be fair that review this book as I was only able to skim through it. I just so happen to discover I had this one in my collection. However, having already read The Rapids, and Dark Sky first, it was hard to go back through all that was already revealed the the two books that come after this one.I hated The Rapids, however Dark Sky, and Nights Landing were enjoyable enough. I really love Juliet's character. Her story with Booker is told in Dark Sky, but you get a taste of her in this book. I would recomment this book, but I would recommend they be read in order. I understand that there are two more that come even before this one."
5,Very cute hedgehog,I bought it for a gift to a friend that have a collection of little non-common plushes so this is perfect for her. It is so cute that it is going to be difficult to gift it because I would like to keep it.
4,"Cute, but not as life like as some of the other Folkmanis puppets.","I ordered this as a stocking stuffer. It's very cute for the price, but not as realistic as some of the other Folkmanis puppets we own. Still a good choice for little fingers."
3,Hedgehog,It's cute and my daughter likes hedgehogs but she didn't play with it for very long. Now its in the stuffed animal bin with all the others. She might rediscover it and start playing with it at some point.
4,College Grad Gift.......,"This was a gift for my daughters college graduation, solely because she loves puppets, and she really wants a hedgehog for a pet.....not sure how educational, etc that is (probably none) but the toy was nicely made and very cute!"
4,A slightly different present,"Bachelder's book rotates around a hysterical idea. He offers tart commentary with his depiction of an America where the left's only hope is the resurrection of a turn of the century muckraker. He gets a little bit lost in the middle, but gets back on track for a satisfying conclusion."
1,Seler doesn't take time to present product well,"While there is nothing wrong with the product I got, I was under the impression I was ordering something different because of the picture. I realize now, that they have all of their mallets pictured, and I had to guess which one I was buying. I guessed wrong. User error? Maybe, but that is not how the rest of the products on any online store are listed, so 20% my fault, 80% crap listing."
5,Must own,Buy the complete Studio Recordings and the American Prayer cd and this Doors box set and you pretty much have it all to have a complete wonderful listening time......support your favorite artists.
3,The only thing you'll need from this box is:,"Live in new york,that's an amazing live-cd! That one gets 5 stars..the rest is just like any of the greatest hits...to answer the previous review,Smokie is a lot worse than the doors on releasing Greatest Hits!! i've seen about 20 greatest hits with smokie and some of them are even 3 discs! Yuck!"
3,"One good disc, two decent ones and one ridiculous filler.","This box set is mostly an ... attempt to trick fans of the band into dropping [$] on a bunch of recycled and misleading tracks. Disc 3 is great and would be worth the price of one CD, but only Doors junkies should consider dropping the duckets to buy this set. Consider purchasing the studio CDs and the one disc Live album instead."
2,How to take good stuff and make a mess,"Ok, I am a hardcore fan who has a lot of bootleg but I had the box set before having all the bootlegs that I have and when i first listened to it, I figured I should have concentrated on bootlegs rather than on this pitiful box set. Some songs cut and pasted without any order, all the world pacific demos all separated, some great left overs such as You Need Meat. The pretty useless band favorites containing song that you already have. The Rock is Dead session incomplete missing important stuff such as Love Me Tender and Queen of the Magazines. Worst of all, the Live in New York disc containing songs from 4 different concerts, all re-arranged and some, recorded somewhere else such as Gloria. Really, Jim would be pretty ashamed of his former fellows."
3,It's good but it could be a lot better.,The Cd is pretty good but it doesn't have half the songs that I consider classic Doors songs. Basicaly the Box Set fell below my expectations....But I still love The Doors
4,"Most of it's good, some is pure crap.","The box opens with ""Five to One."" Besides historical value, why the hell would you want to listen to it? The sound really blows, Jim's obviously drunk, and the band is kind of drowned out by all the noise. It's moments of pure garbage like that, and the overlong ""Train Song"" (also poor sound quality) that keep this box from a 5. The last disc is stuff you already have if you're even thinking about buying a box of the Doors, but some moments are pure genious. Many a great performance graces this collection, including the greatest ""Celebration of the Lizard"" you'll ever hear. Other gems include ""Go Insane"" part of ""Celebration"" but definitely worth listening to for Ray Manzarek's ""insanity"" on the piano. Just try to overlook ""Five to One"" and other moments of inferior '60s technology and you've got a great box perfect for any Doors' fan."
3,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,"the good material on this cd has been released before, and the collection of other stuff does not justify the cost of the cd. I wonder if morrison has been caught on tape after a trip through the beanpot if his flatuence would have been included as well."
2,So so,"This set has some real gems on it. But in all honesty, the gems are few and far between. One disc is ""the Doors favorites"" that have songs that are on their other albums. And if you are the type to be buying a box set, you probably have those other albums, so don't need duplicate copies of those songs. There is one disc that is of the Doors live, and it's nothing that great. The gems include songs off their first demo tape (where, oddly, they sound kind of like the VELVET UNDERGROUND), and a great jazz version of QUEEN OF THE HIGHWAY, which I LOVE. It's the best thing on the album. So if you are a real Doors fanatic, you'll appreciate the gems on this album. But for everyone else, this isn't worth it."
2,Filler,"A lot of filler on here. Some good stuff. But a lot of mediocre- to-bad stuff, too. And the song TIGHT ROPE RIDE sung by Ray Manzarak sounds just like Spinal Tap!"
1,THE HIGHLIGHT IS DESTROYED-THE DEMOS,"The big highlight to me was the early demos. Wow, when I first heard them from a low generation bootleg. Crackles and all, they are better than what they used on this. What the heck did they do to make them so muffled sounding, use some kind of funky noise reduction? They would have been better off using the bootlegs. Awful...but oh the memories of those long nights with the bootlegs in the 80s..."
1,Buy The Albums Instead,"This boxed set was a deep disappointment and I was embarrassed to have bought it. The new material is patchy and badly recorded. The great classic hits are there, but in really poor versions. You really should save your money and use it to buy the individual albums."
3,"If you find it used, go for it...","You gotta be a pretty big Doors fan to want this thing in the first place, but if you actually ARE that big of a fan, you'll probably be let down a bit. A lot of over-producton and post-show touch up work went into the 3 discs of live stuff, which robs it of much charm. The 4th disc is a rather insulting ""band favorites"" best of. Kinda hard to know how to feel when a band charges you this kinda money to say ""Here, these are the songs you were SUPPOSED to like instead!""So, if you can find it nice and cheap used, go for it, because some of it is still pretty good. Don't pay full price, though."
4,good!! But???,"Does anybody believe like i do that "" The Doors "" are simply the best headphone music ever made, (with the exception of Pink floyd maybe) Why fill a box set with a bunch of B.S. like live and demos etc. Yes this IS a great set, but let's not mix all the great studio stuff with mediocre crap. does anybody own ""Weird Scenes inside the gold mine"" (only on vinyl, i believe) or 8 track hahaha! Put it on C.D.in a box with a glass of Burgandy and a little reefer and let the true ""DOORS"" fan enjoy a night! Thank you very much"
2,Bright but short,"This flashlight is extremely bright, one of the brightest I've seen, with a well focused beam. It is a very compact unit, but requires two hands to turn it on or off. Unfortunately the bright light drains the batteries in just a couple hours, which is disappointing."
1,it's a game stand that doesn't fit,Make sure you have the right model. some slimlines don't fit this type. mine didn't
4,"a bit wobbly, but gets the job done","I bought this stand to save space. For the most part, it does what it was meant to do, that is, it holds the PS2 in place. It is a bit wobbly though, even though there's no chance it would fall. I can't help wondering if this stand was orginally made for the large version of the PS2 instead of the slim, because it has two small things on either side (ostensably for bracing it)but they look like they'd fit the large PS2. But anyway, for the price, I can't complain too much."
1,Wobblomatic Stand,"This stand works for the PS2Slim models with the screw hole on the bottom along with the two slots for ""stability"" lol, yeah right. This thing simply does not hold the PS2 Slim model in a stable manner no matter how tight you screw it on. I might have to wedge something under in-between the stand and the PS2 since theres a gap where it's merely floating above the stand. I have my PS2 right next to my PS3 on my computer desk and even the slightest movement i make causes the desk and PS2 to wobble around from side to side. I know it's not good to have movement when playing games etc, so I don't know if this is worth getting at all. The picture of the product shows what looks like a SLOT that the PS2 goes into to offer support on either side, but in reality this product is nothing like the one pictured."
4,Almost free...and its made well!,"Shipping cost more than the product, but ah well...thats the way it is sometimes! Product is great for the money!"
2,NO SMELL!!!!,"Book is very colorful and cute but my daughter and I were both disappointed, scratch the stickers once and no smell since then. Takes the fun outta it!!"
2,Scratch and scratch but where's the sniff?,"Cute story but after several attepmpts to smell the treats, my son and I couldn't scrach hard enough,there was nothing to smell. We were very disappointed."
1,straberry shortcake book,This is supposed to be a scratch and sniff book.You certanly can scrach but the smell is too light!
1,Crappy smelll,"I buy a lot of scratch and sniff books for my kids, they love them. Not only does this book have no smell, it smells like chemicals at best. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY. This book is over priced and doesn't work. Just stay away!"
2,Cute story but no smell..,AS others posted this book just didnt have smell to the scratch and sniff parts.TOO bad it was a cute story.
5,love it,"I found it at a record exchange, ha ha, man I was amped, Grooverider brings on some good high energy mixing, $hit to really jam to. Fabio, brings a highly groovy, good feeling mix to the plate. Its a good deal all around. Well worth it...."
5,YOU PEOPLE ARE CRAZY,Please disregard everything you've read below this comment! These two mixes have really solid drum & bass tracks on it which I feel outwiegh the somewhat bland mixing. Definitely an album that any junglist should have in their collection.
4,A good read!,"I found this book very entertaining. Definitely a book that parents will enjoy reading to thier children. Very imaginative, and a very interesting story"
4,So so,"Grover Washington, Jr. (1943-1999), inadequately described as a smooth jazz artist, was a gifted jazz-funk saxophonist who died unexpectedly in December of 1999. He was 56 years old. Often credited as being the creator of the smooth genre of jazz music, Washington often injected R&B or funk into his tracks. The album at hand is a decent introduction, though there are better available to you. If you only bought Grover's 1974 Kudu Records classic ""Mister Magic"", you'd receive a much nicer aftertaste following a listening. Most of the tracks at hand here are Creed Taylor productions, and the sound quality is fairly good. Four star album. Just purchase ""Mister Magic""."
4,I wish Soteria was still alive!,A very useful book for those who have been victims of the mental health system in the USA. It gives you hope and insight into alternative treatments without medication. I wish the place was still open....I hope someone would take this vision and build upon it!!
5,Mind expanding for the understanding of ALL,"this book light up my true spirit, pulling me up from the hatred pool of human society. It explains everything in dimension, universe, earth history and etc. It's a great book. READ IT TO FEEL THE DEEP MEANING OF THE UNIVERSE. TAKE AWAY THE BURDEN OF SOCIETY, TRADITION, BELIEFS, CRITICISM OF OTHERS AND ANGER TOWARD THE UNFAIR,CRUEL SOCIETY. READ IT TO CHANGE THE LONESOME WAY OF LIFE"
4,Review,"This is a very interesting book. It had a lot of information that was knew to me, information that is mostly about Atlantis.It also makes you think about the consequences of human decisions or behavior.Some history is repeating or is about to repeat again.It is also good to know how there can be advanced beings for a long time, and how some of those same beings can use their power in the wrong direction.E.V."
3,Simple Questions,Was hoping for more information & conclusions regarding her travels & sessions. It appears that her books are more like diaries rather then summation.
3,An interesting book - but read with discernment.,"I found this book to be very interesting, but I am rather skeptical about what she is actually doing. As with all of her books, she gets alot of esoteric information through clients, who end up retrieving information from - well, from wherever... Who is she actually talking to, and what is she actually learning? I think that the jury is out on this...As a reader, I found the book to be rather long, and at times a bit tedious. However the topic itself is fascinating, and DC has a writing style that makes even the longest book seem to go in an instant.As a hypnotherapist, I am very interested both in her techniques and in the theory behind her research. They are, to say the least, controversial - even among the hypnotherapists who do esoteric work.I recommend the book for anyone interested in esoteric hypnosis, but I urge the reader to use considerable discernment when reading it."
5,Fascinating glimpse of the New Earth!,"Dolores Cannon in book one of the Convoluted Universe, (actually book 2 if you start with the Custodians)takes us on a journey through the eyes of her clients who go under hypnosis to reveal their experiences with extraterrestrials and more. Truly a page turner and highly recommmended."
4,Be Careful of What You Buy!!,"If you already own ""Nog"" by the Blenders then their is no need to purchase this CD. THE TWO CD'S ARE IDENTICAL. We have enjoyed ""Nog"" since buying it a few years ago. We were very excited to see another Blenders Christmas CD............NOT!!The name of the CD is different, the packaging of the CD is different. BUT THE MUSIC IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS ""NOG"". While I enjoy their music this is at the very least an unethical buisness practice and gets dangerously close to FRAUD!"
3,Typical Blenders CD,"The sound of the Blenders is pretty much the same through all of their music. If you like them, you'll like this Christmas CD."
5,so cool,This is the perfect toy for any chid well because I'm one and I wish they still sold these things in stores for less. And if you are one of the super fans of pr than this is for you.
3,"Product is excellent, price at Amazon is high","The mix is, indeed, excellent. Super easy to prepare and bake. I usually double the size of each scone.But price at Amazon is really high. We can get these at the local Giant Food for about $4.00. Giant only has the blueberry and lemon poppyseed, though. If not for the $10 - $12 price tag at Amazon, I would try some of the other flavors."
2,A Total Divorce!!!,"This movie just plain stunk! Don't know why I'm surprised. I'm notorious for picking out crappy movies. BUT I thought I was safe with this one because of its ""big"" stars. The acting & dialogue seemed awkward. The married couple didn't have any sort of rapport or attraction. And it just ended up not making a whole helluva lotta sense all-around - which always totally irks me. The only reason I didn't give it only ONE star is because of Roy Scheider & Eric Roberts (although sadly, Eric only had a brief appearance). Don't waste your time or money on this bomb! I'm glad I only rented it, but still....that's $4.50 I'll never get back! =\"
3,He is so shrewed...,Some women don't like men? So why would you marry such a woman?What sparks wild violent outbursts in a monster anyway?Does any modern man expect his wife to be a virgin on the honeymoon?Screw top champaign and a motel aren't my idea of a first night either.Story after story about the disturbed girl's childhood followas the boy Paul tells the FBI agent his tale.So what it the truth about all these dead people?
2,"This movie is more than good , but the DVD is a bad production !","Get this movie , but better look out for another version in the hope that they did a better job in the studio.I have never seen a movie edited that bad !!!I can do that better if I have to."
5,Does the job,"I like the size of this humidifier/vaporizor, but it is a little noisier than I expected. I could not find the filters instore anywhere, which was very annoying but I think I saw them at WalMart recently. We run the vaporizor almost 24 hrs a day since our baby girl was born 2.5 yrs ago and I have used 4 filters. It's good for white noise too. Just remember to run it dry each time to make the filter last longer and prevent mildew from growing in the container."
4,Gandys on the Mopac,"Throughout the pages of ""Gandys on the Mopac"", I envisioned the colorful characters, most of whom were a swell bunch.If you like stories which took place during simpler times in rural America, this one's for you.I now have a great appreciation of those hard-working railmen of yesteryear. Indeed they worked hard, but they played hard, too!"
1,Horrible!,"I just don't get this ""Nu-Metal"" stuff. It's horrible! To me, they all sound the same, and steal all their riffs from korn. Not that korn's any good either. This may not be as bad as limp bizkit or linkin park, but it comes pretty close."
2,"Half good, half...not so much","I won't go into a song by song review, simply because there isn't enough good material to do so, but tracks 1,3,5,8,10,12 and 13 are all worth a listen. The rest are throwaway. I've enjoyed both of nino's latest records from start to finish, but revolution simply isn't a solid listen."
5,ill nino !! 1 of the best!!,"This CD is one of the heaviest and best CD's I've ever heard. They go harder than alot of bands out there and they don't over do it. They also don't follow the trend of putting out a crappy 2nd album. Check out Confession. The whole album is great .. I like I am loco, rip out your eyes, no murder, predisposed, god save us, if you still hate me,unreal, revolution/revolucion, And if you have the album with bonus tracks ,, fallen is cool.ill Nino Rocks.."
4,viva la revolucion,"A sort of spin off from soulfly, this album makes its claim in that it's just different enough. Some won't like the album and others will love it."
1,A sick...sick joke of a band,"Though they aren't as horrible as Saliva or Drowning Pool (that my friends is almost impossible) Ill Nino, one of nu metals latest nails in it's coffin, is still...well bad, very bad, funny bad, I really do feel sorry for their mothers...Ill Nino is a mix of horrible vocals, cliche lyrics, and montonous chord progressions. Listening to it will make your intellegence drop. Still...if you listen to a lot of Slipknot I guess you have nothing to lose."
3,"if ur gonna copy soulfly, do it decently!","i heard that these guys were supposed to sound like soulfly, so i went out and listened to this. everything about this sucks, and it sounds nothing like soulfly. i can hear faint bits of some of the tribal influences used by max cavalera, but they only come across as a poor attempt to seperate themselves from the rest of the cliched nu-metal bands that don't go anywhere, kind of like that retarded band boiler room. i'm giving it 3 stars though cause it doesn't piss me off like other bands like this do."
2,OK BUT NOT GOOD,"This album is good if you like the new korn cd or if your into the deftones, but this cd is not for metal-heads,so if your looking for some big time full blown metal, this is not it."
5,An Excellent Crossover of Latin and Metal!!!,"Imagine going down to Mexico and hearing what people consider to be ""Latin music"", and then in the same song see that ""Latin music"" and then all of a sudden, like start hitting Slayer-like riffs and blast beats. Woah. That my friends, is Ill Nino. This band is very different from most of the nu-metal out there. They have come out with a sound much their own. The vocalist is so intense that he can go from a nice very lovely singing voice to roars and screams. It is unbelieveable how the mix of Latin and Metal go together so well. I mean, this is one of the most messed up things that I have ever heard.The lyrics are just very different, from the intense, to thequestionable, to the noscensical. The music itself is so addictive, that it pulls you into a mantra of hard sound, and strange melodies. This is one recomendation that is for all metal heads who are into something different than what is mostly out there.Peace..."
4,"No Love At All? Come on kids, put it up in NJ.","Ill nino is incredibly underrated. From the El, it is Ill and they're movin up from playin Birch Hill to Ozfest. But they always show love but laying it out at birch hill for those who are true. Revolution Revolución is a unique mixture ofnu-Latin-metal-core straight out of NJ and posibly the finest thing to that ever came out of NJ. short. Its worth the cash."
2,Not typical of Chicago Blues,"CD album not what I thought it was....Of course PB plays a mouth harp.....of course, the songs sometimes all sound alike...that is why he's not a ZZ, BB or whatever. One maybe two songs on these 2 cd's I like.....the rest go in file 13. There's nothing wrong with this style of music but it falls far short of Buddy Guy, BB King, Albert King....I am/was relunctant to negative any musician and this is not the case....Many of his good songs are missing and ""fillers"" placed instead. Unless you are a whipping Paul Butterfield fan, keep looking......"
4,Paul Butterfield Blues Band,"My grandson who,s 17 is lead guitar in a high school rock combo, and we talked about simultaneous pulsating energy and virtuoso parts for the singer and lead guitar together. I started thinking about 1965-66 in Chicago and recalled the Butterfield band as what I wanted him to hear. So I got him a set and got myself a set. Album #1 in the Electra collection was what I had in mind, and he now listens to it everyday, loving it. He's already pretty good, if you will excuse me.Man, how that man wasted his life later. Sad.I am keeping this album. La Raw Maran"
2,It Works,"I purchased this printer because I travel a lot and really liked the idea of not having to lug around not only a larger printer but a power adapter as well. It worked okay, but I really can't say much more for it than that. The battery life was shorter than I expected (only got me through about 25 pages rather than 100) and the print quality was about what you would expect from a thermal printer -- just adequate.That said, I did not return it, as it is a great size and weight. As long as you don't set your expectations too high and you'll be satisfied."
1,Will be returning the Krups XP2070 after 2 weeks,"I received this on May 30, 09 as a gift after seeing it and briefly commenting on its lovely appearance. After two weeks of daily hassles, I will be returning this product. The water resevior is awkward to fill, coffee brews very slowly and the caraffe does not catch all of the coffe that brews. This coffee spills onto the countertop, in my limited experience apx. 1/3 of the amount of coffee I've expected to brew in the pot ends up on the counter (and today into the drawer below the counter and the floor). Spout on the caraffe also is tricky, unless it is poured very slow, the coffee dribbles down the side of the pot and again... onto the counter. I haven't used the espresso option and don't dare try it at this point. This product will be returned to Bed, Bath and Beyond today along with my strong recomendation that they remove the item from their inventory."
1,Not even worth 1 star,"Machine was a Christmas gift. Worked for about 3 months before we were told ""to send it to a Krups repair shop in NJ"". Waited for nearly 3 months before it was sent back at my urging - they couldn't fix it so they sent me a used model. It leaks, has corroded itself, the coffee caraffe has broken 4 times (2 of those times spontaneously) and each time it needs replacing, the Krups customer svc is out of them...goes to show you how often this must happen. The espresso portion overheats itself and NEVER has pressure enough to push out 2 oz of espresso. REALLY DISSAPPOINTED with the customer service & product. A very painful $300 to part with. No one at Krups is willing to replace this machine. DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Broke within a week,"I bought the XP 2070 with the hopes of having better coffee and the espresso option. Within one week of purchase (one round of capuccinos), I am unable to turn on the espresso maker. I called customer service, and they asked me to ship the machine back and wait a month-and-a-half because ""the warehouse has closed,"" even though this is the newest model. Very reluctantly, they threw in a few free coffee filters in the deal. I wish I had read other Amazon customer posts, that indicate that not even the CEO responds to customer service complaints.They also said they had no information on troubleshooting the machine ""because we just introduced it."" It seems that any decent machine testing would check to see that you could turn on the machine. Please do not make the same mistake I did, especially with a holiday gift!"
2,Was Fine While it Worked ......,"I must echo the comments in previous reviews. This is a fine machine at first -- does the job and does it well -- but the instructions were very complicated, the pot is poorly designed & you end up pouring just as much coffee on the counter as you do in your cup, and after 4 months of use, mine just stopped working. I really thought this $300 machine would be the last coffee maker I would have to purchase for awhile considering my $50.00 ""Mr Coffee"" machine worked for 5 years and is now being used as my ""backup"" while I try to get a resolution with Krups. (Thank goodness I decided to hold onto it!!)Think twice before sinking so much money into this product."
2,customer beware,"I have used this maker for 5 months daily--primarily for the espresso feature. The espresso tastes terrific, however the maker has many problems. Such as, the steam nozzle ""blows"" off and can cause a burn to your hand. In terms if the coffee maker, the coffee pot lid does not stay on properly and is poorly designed and you will poor hot coffee on your hand or table top while tipping the pot. The directions to operate the machine are very complicated; and finally my machine is broken and not working. I have followed all directions in terms of cleaning, which requires disassempling a filter and so forth. Very time consuming. I do not recommend this very high-maintenance machine. I am in the market for something more reliable and consider the $300 a waste of my money for only 5 months use."
1,After years of owning a Krups ....what a disappointment,"First of all, the machine made an excellent espresso, nice foamy crema, however, the water was not hot enough to make coffee the temperature was a meager 140 degrees where it should have been a 160 degree. It was impossible to pour without spilling all over the countertop. Oh and the noise, make sure everyone is up before commencing making espresso or steaming milk. A very awkward design as far as pouring water in and fitting under the counter."
2,Not built to last,"I had my machine for 6 weeks, I loved it! I didn't like the coffee pot - it was very light and I was so worried I'd break it, but it made good espresso and it was easy to use. BUT...after 5 weeks I was having trouble getting it to pump the espresso. I thought the filter was clogged, but it wouldn't even put out water without a filter. So, I returned it. The guy told me ""we get a lot of these back"". Apparently, the pump had failed...after only 6 weeks."
1,abysmal! difficult to use & then died @ 20months: DO NOT PURCHASE!,"this machine is confusing to use & inconsistent. steam wand flies off when frothing milk, causing burns. even setting the clock requires getting out the manual, & the programming only sticks for a few uses & then the machine ""forgets"" and requires reprogramming. we have broken the carafe 4x and a replacement costs $30. finally, as per many other reviews on this site, the machine has stopped working. plug it in--nothing. dead as a doornail. this is something i might expect in a cheap $59 machine, but for $300 this machine should last for years. very disappointing that Krups isn't standing by this product & replacing it. i am not even going to bother returning it to Krups considering other reviewers' experiences with that. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Good machine but service stinks.,"Sent in $1000 cappuccino machine for recall and service. Six months later, still waiting. Called Krups Customer Service and the most helpful thing "" Tom "", the "" Supervisor "" could say was "" Have a Nice Evening "". Yikes ! If it breaks, throw it away. Their service Dept. does not seem to function."
2,krups xp2070,"Not sure if this product was new or refurbished...,although I bought it with the impression it was new.........it came with a few dents and the user manual was not an original it was photo copied....the coffee maker did not brew at the 199 degree temperature it was luke warm I had to ship it out to the company I received it from......I did receive a credit.....my other krups lasted 26 years....."
2,"Good coffee, poor durability","This machine worked well for us for about eighteen months. Then it just stopped working. I opened it up to see if it had a fuse or something, but none is apparent. Since it is out of warranty it sounds like the costs to repair and the likelihood of having a good functioning machine afterwards (based on other reviews on this site) are not worth the effort. There have to be better machines for $300 out there that will last more than two years. My wife's family in Italy have had the same espresso machine for as long as I have known them. About fifteen years."
3,Worked great for 2 months....then krumped,We put this on our registry and were thrilled to get it. I LOVED it for the 2 months we owned it. Then it decided that it just didn't want to flow anything from the espresso side. I thought surely it can't be clogged already. So i descaled. Still - nothing would flow. The water just came out the bottom. I was so mad!! 2 months of WONDERFUL lattes and then nothing. So i packed it up and returned it today. Now I am looking at others and will probably spend up to $500 for a quality machine. I also agree with others - the directions on this Krups one were awful and wrong sometimes.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF KRUP,"They say don't look a gift horse in the mouth, well this horse shouldn't have left the Krups drawing board. First of all, if you're going to market something in the US, please write the manual in plain English. Second Design design design! Make it so it doesn't just look good, make it functional and built to last. This maker is flimsy and cheap, not worthy of the $300 price tag. I love espresso, but won't make it with this because of all the steps involved. OMG!Third, the timer follows no logic whatsoever, like the electrical engineers that came up with this programming scheme were on crack or something. Very frustrating.If you want an easy to use machine, DON'T BUY THIS ONE!(but the coffee it makes is pretty good)"
4,I want to buy this item but.....................,"I haven't noticed any complaints about the way the carafe on the coffee pot pours? I have the XP2010 and you have to pour it sooooooooo slow or else you'll have a huge mess!!!! I've contacted the company and they say that they cannot help me with this prob, and my only solution is to return the machine since it's within 90 days of my purchase.Help, I can use some feedback on this subject!"
2,KRUPS XP2070--2months and no power!!,"When I purchased the XP2070...seemed simple and made a good cup of expresso. I used it daily for drip coffee and then today--the power did not come on. Like some other reviewers--no power, no LED, no display--NOTHING. Thank goodness, I had purchased it at a military store and still under the 90 day store warranty and they took it back with no problems. I'll keep looking for a reliable combo machine!"
3,Not too bad but not too goog eather,This machine does great expresso and good coffe but don't buy it if you like cappuccino. The frohing tip comes of EVERY time I use it.Other than that it is a very good machine once you get use to it.Also it looks great.
2,Poor Performance,"My siblings bought this machine for my husband and I for our 10 yr. wedding anniversary. It worked for about 1 year, and then began giving us fits of various sorts. When simply making coffee, the water runs out of the overflow reservoir--and not just a little bit of water. We had to begin placing 2-3 towels around the bottom of the machine and/or on the floor anytime we hit the start button, otherwise we would return to a pool of water on the counter, which eventuatlly pooled on our hardwood floors below. Ridiculous. Recently, the electronics seem to have gone bad. The display either remains bright blue--it should be dimmed out with only the numbers/symbols displayed--or it blinks epileptically and makes a ticking sound until it is unplugged. Pretty expensive item to only last 1 year (of course just past the warranty). DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Good if you are looking for a disposable coffee maker,"I found that, when this item worked, it worked well--nice crema and good milk frothing on the espresso side, and pretty good coffee on the coffee side. The problem was that it broke after five months of use. The main issue was that the water on the espresso maker side began coming out the bottom of the unit, but I also found the steamer to occasionally shoot off as well. I exchanged it for a new unit, and again, after five months of use, the water on the espresso side began coming out the bottom. So if you are looking for a combination coffee and espresso maker that is disposable and needs to be replaced every five months, this is your machine."
2,"Good while it lasted, service useless, Krups about the same","I had my XP2070 for some 4-years before it stopped working after only light use. I sent it for repair to Vanness, Akansas(authorized repair center) at my cost of $55 dollars, they emailed a couple of times, but it has never been returned or an explanation given for the lack of a return. I wrote Krups HQ to complain, they never replied.I for one will never buy Krups again. See my full description here markcathcart dot com"
3,Espresso side quit.... Time to descale?,I received this machine in 2008 as a wedding gift. I've never had a problem with it until now. The espresso side isn't working properly. It fills the overflow tray rather than pushing water through the espresso pod. I'm wondering if it needs to be descaled? I've never used anything to clean the mineral build up. I tired a vinegar/water solution today... With no luck. I'm going to buy a stronger product before I go off and spend another $300-$400 on a new machine!
2,Just died...,"The product, when it worked was sufficient...although you couldn't pour a cup of coffee without spilling with configuration of carafe. I noticed after about a year of use a few times a week, there would be a puddle of water under the machine. Then one day...no power...I have seen this from so many other comments that I truly believe it is a defect...considering the price! Krups is not willing to take any sort of responsibility, so I will avoid purchasing from the company. I really can't believe it hasn't been taken off the market with the amount of poor feedback. I have always thought Krups was a reliable company, but on this product...well...they certainly do not live up to this recognition."
1,2nd machine,"The 1st one was well maintained and I was filtering the water through britax filters. It failed after 14months. Got it repaired and it costed me 130. It failed again after 9mth and the repair service center went out of business. Right. You might say ""Why did he buy a 2nd one ?"". Because I got it at a Bargain price (50). I bought the unit from a guy who didn't like expressos and only used it occasionally when receiving guests + he never used the expresso feature. It failed again. Even though it's well maintained and cleaned with puly caff, the pump failed on me. It's extremely annoying."
1,3 rd machine none work,"I own two homes and am ashamed to admit that I bought two of these machines. Well niether one worked right. Instead of realizing my purchase mistakes and returning them, I brought them back and exchanged them as broken and wanted new ones. Again no luck. The esspresso machine turns on and nothing happens. Keep in mind , this is four different machines with the same result. Water comes out from the bottom. The blue lights flicker , and we try again. Tonight after trying to make esspresso for 15 minutes, I got frustrated once again, and went to the internet to look at reviews of what others thought. Well I wish I had read these before I bought my 1st machine. I will never buy anything again without reading other peoples reviews. This machine is CRAP !!! Don't make a mistake a buy one."
1,Really Disappointing....,"I bought this machine from WS. We had another combination machine from krups that was over 10 years old and I wanted an updated look. This machine is PRETTY, looks great sitting on the counter. That's about all it's worth. Truly, I'm sick about it. The coffee part broke after a year, I have had to make due and it has just slowly been dying. The espresso part actually still works fine. It literally shuts itself off with the TWO HOUR timer before coffee is done brewing (yes, you read that right, it is taking over 2 hours to brew a pot) and even when I try to make 3 cups it is lukewarm. I'm on year 2 with this machine and have been trying to suck it up due to the price but I'm done. I would have been willing to try to stick with krups, but as other reviewers pointed out their service support is awful. I would have to pay $40 to $50 just in shipping to get it to the service center and then pay MORE to have it fixed. For that, I can get a nice stand alone unit...."
2,Design Horror,"Received as a gift. Hideous expanse of cheap-looking aluminum on face. Takes about an acre of counter space. Needs lots of clearance above it to fill the reservoir, which may be a problem if you place on kitchen countertop like mine and have cabinets above it. Heavy, so sliding it out from under those upper cabinets is a chore. You will have to rely on other postings to receive insight on the operation of the unit, as above aesthetic and practical deficiencies inspired me to donate to charity before use."
1,Nice while it lasted,"I got this machine for Christmas '06. After about 5 months of regular use (it's not like I'm using it to run a cafe or anything) my espresso maker quit on me. Support was helpful, but only after a few lengthy hold times. To my surprise the service center sent me back a brand new machine. Sadly, I'm writing this review after my second espresso side failure, this time out of warranty, to caution shoppers.The espresso maker works well. As other reviewers have noted, the steamer nozzle does have a tendency to pop off.The coffee maker has always disappointed me. For some reason, the coffee it brews is never very hot.Overall the machine is quirky and has usability issues, but is capable of making some great espressos... for about 5 months. Then it fails."
1,If anger had caffine I wouldn't be able to sleep,"This espresso/coffee maker worked great for about 5 months, although it was off balance and very loud when it would pump espresso through. After a 1/2 year I can't even turn on the machine. The outlet is good, it was never near or in water, and customer supports says ship it back and wait up to 7 weeks for return if its approved. I've searched the web and I can't find a good remark about this product. If I could give a ""0"" in product wainting I would."
2,looks aren't everything,"We too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned. We already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off, nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem. Now a month after using the new one, its espresso pump is loud and noisy, sounding like its broken. Also for some reason or another it won't send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso. It ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out. But then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine. Its been going for the last couple of days, but its such a iffy thing. On the plus side it does look nice! And it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work! My husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow, but he says that about everything!"
1,terrible,Got it as a weddign present--- the expresso part died within the year and the coffee part soon thereafter. STAY AWAY
3,Good - for a while anyway,"I purchased two of these machines. One I used daily and the other only occasionally. Now, after three years both have stopped working within several months of eachother. The problem is in the electronics. I expected better quality."
1,Leaks everytime,"I purshcased the RXP 2070 Krups coffee maker/espresso combo to fullfill my coffee addiction. It makes a great cup of coffee and even better espresso; however, the machine leaks. Everytime I use it there's a large amount of water underneath the machine. I don't expect this machine to last very long because of the leak. I am also concerned about the hazard of water and electricity so I unplug it everytime. Save your money."
3,Could Have Been a Contender,"Just when it seemed like I had a coffeed maker that could keep up with my exacting expectations for espresso on demand, it crapped out after three months of use... went DEAD... no power coming into it, and no way to trouble shoot it (fuse, reboot, etc.). Seems to be a common problem, and it apparently always happens when you're not looking or using it. It just slips away in the middle of the night. DECEASED.So I contacted Cool N Cheap (the Amazon vendor), and never heard back from them.The machine had a lot of potential - produced excellent espresso, and could keep cranking them out, cup after cup, in the middle of a party. I had never owned anything like it, and was congratulating my wise decision until death did us part.So, dear Cool N Cheap - if you read this, please tell me whether you can bring this steel contraption back to life. I miss the espresso factory."
3,Coffee Maker,"The coffee maker is working fine. Although it was sold as new , it had none of the original packaging and the expresso bowl was missing. The price was very good and for the money the unit has been working."
1,Maybe we got a lemon?,"We loved this machine for about 4 months, and then it broke. We sent it to a sort-of-local place to have it fixed, because Krups said they'd take 4 weeks. After about 4 weeks, we got it back, and it worked for a while (but the readout didn't work). Shortly after that, the espresso maker crapped out. My husband (who is an excellent mechanic) cleaned it thoroughly, and it worked once and then stopped working again. What a disappointment, especially because we had splurged on it($450+) as an anniversary gift for ourselves."
1,Stop selling this item!,$300 for just over a years worth of coffee making. Obviously this machine is horribly flawed (just look at the reviews). Some shred of customer service from krups would have been nice. Last krups item I ever buy.
2,You get what you pay for,"This watch certainly looks pretty, and it is when you first get it, but after every-day wear, the gold fades and the watch is then silver. Some of the crystals fell out also. It served its purpose for a while though, I just wish the gold didn't fade.My suggestion would be to save a little money and get something nice."
3,"It's what we expected, great toy!","It's what we expected, It would be better if would come with wrestlers toys and some utensils."
3,Good,"My son loved it, he received it christmas of 2010 and the the clear plastic frame that holds the sliding doors broke about 4 months or so after he got it. Usually we get him I different ring every christmas and they hold up fine, even the basic one, the elastic ropes started breaking down before he got his new one which was a year later. It has been somewhat a disapointment with the pieces not lasting and my husband and I had to try to fix it. My son is very good with his things he rarely ever breaks anything, esp his wrestling toys cause he wants them to work so he can play with them."
3,Need Lots of patience!,We bought this for our grandson's 10th birthday - It's difficult to put together! You need to use a maginifying glass to read the instructions! He took it home and of course fell apart - he's having a difficult time putting it together by himself. My advise is - make sure you put it together at the location you want it to stay and a teen or adult needs to help out! It's pretty cool looking once put together. It's alot of money for this toy!
5,"Very, very, very, cool....","Hey...Wolfman's brother, Jesus left Chicago, Weigh, Taste, Wekapong Groove=a cool disc..."
2,"Slip Stitch, uh...pass.","This is a decent live album, but it lacks when compared to....all other live Phish albums. Not sure why they felt the need to release it.First it's only 9 songs. Some sets are 9 songs long. It was recorded in Germany. Chances are you weren't at that show. My opinion is that the setlist is just ok. No versions of songs here blow me away.The big plus for me is that one of the two covers is Cities (Talking Heads). Oh, and really cool artwork.I guess my point is this is a decent album, but if you don't have a recording of your own attended shows, at least get the 2-disc ""A Live One"", or the 6-disc ""Hampton Comes Alive"". Both are often cheap used here. There's many other official live releases as well."
4,Live Phish is where it's ate... SS&P is no exception.,"I am asked by Phish-newcomers all the time, ""what is your favorite Phish album""? That, for me, is a hard question to answer. Hard not because ""they're all good"" (which I guess they all are, in some respects), but hard because in my opinion, _live_ Phish music is where it's at. Sure, I love You Enjoy Myself on Junta, but when played live, it takes on a whole new form of its own. A Live One was good, but it was not as good as it could have been (Bouncin'? Slave?). SS&P, on the other hand, makes up for it. Perhaps _the_ defining Phish disc to date."
2,unfortunate indicator,"Phish has gradually devolved from a highly experimental, fusion-style band of creative virtuosos into a standard R&B jam band. Possibly attracting more fans this way, as well as reconstituting the mellow Dead feel, they seem successful. But I miss Trey's pushing the envelope so far that your head almost bursts and then a melody so sweet and beautiful issues forth that you swear Beethoven's been reborn as a guitarist. A word of fan advice to Trey: take back your lead! The old-time fans miss you!"
4,nice grooves,"This is a very good album with solid playing throughout, but especially on: Jesus Just Left Chicago, Mikes Song, and Weekapaug Groove. The only songs I would've left out are Cities (very annoying), and Hello My Baby(it's not bad just a little out of place). This is the best Phish album I've heard, even at it's lamest it's still fairly enjoyable, except for Cities which is just bad. If you like this then check out A Live One which is good, but I think has a few more weaker songs then this one does."
2,Live Phish?????,"I never thought I would be writing a critical review of a Phish album, but I was very dissapointed with this album. What happened??? It lacks the vitality and joy of a live show. I've been going to shows for six years and have never heard them so lifeless as they sound on this album. I'm an avid phan and will always go to see them live, but this album was a big let-down. In fact, I'm kind of sad to be writing this. I never thought I would be dissapointed in a Phish album. At least they continue to rock on stage!!"
3,Not the best,"I just got this CD, and maybe I'll hear some incredible things after a few more listens, but so far it doesn't seem like their best work. Maybe it's just me, but the vocals sound alittle off --something seems different to me -- as compared to their other live stuff. The song selection is decent, especially Wolfman's Brother and Mike's Song, but it could better. Hampton Comes Alive and A Live One are deffinetly stronger albums with better songs."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"Phish is one of the most overrated bands ever, their original songs lyrics are usually really dumb inside jokes that you won't get unless you have wasted a large amount of your time listening to these guys. The only good parts are when Trey and Page rock out hard on other peoples songs (Jesus Left Chicago, the Keith Richards' riff from Can you hear me knockin, and Doors the end rift with Careful with that Axe from Floyd). The bottom line-this is still better than 99% of commercial music and there is some virtuoso playing to be heard here but spend your money on some Hendrix, Galatic or the Doors instead."
3,"Vastly inferior to ""A Live One""","Although Phish live is always an excellent treat, this album contains the most somnabulant versions of these songs available. Phish's live style has evolved to such a point that their shows, while better than ever to watch, do not translate nearly as well onto tape. (those who were at the third Worcester show over Thanksgiving might know what I'm talking about). Anyway, although the songs are quite good, the version are definitely lacking. If you want to really check out what it's like to be at a Phish concert, check out ""A Live One""... or better yet, buy a ticket."
4,excellent job,"While I found Lee's first album to be better, at least in terms of choosing material which is less familiar to most listeners, I enjoyed this one tremendously. I've had many friends become fans based on this recording and I understand why. His diction is very good, his voice is pleasant, and his delivery is superb. I love what he did with ""Storybook"" and ""I'll Imagine You a Song"" is one of the most uplifting, yet bittersweet, songs I've heard in a while. Buy this CD!"
3,One of the Best Cabaret Voices but not the best selection...,"I have listened to this recording a number of times and purchased it based on Lee's first album. The notable songs, that make it all worth while include ""I'll Imagine You A Song"" and ""Endless Night"". I would strongly recommend Lee's first album and simply give this one 3 stars."
2,"Wonderful voice, except too many selections sound alike","I enjoy Lee Lessack's voice; it's so smooth and comforting. I really adore his ''Moon Is a Harsh Mistress'' and ''Endless Night'' from ''Lion King.'' On the other side of the coin, there's a sameness to his ballad-heavy selections. And I wish his song choices were more original. For instance, Lessack does ''Storybook'' from ''Scarlet Pimpernel,'' a gorgeous tune, but it's a longtime signature song of Tom Andersen, who sings it with more urgency and thrilling high notes on his CD, ''The Journey.''"
1,This is a piece of junk!,"I bought this to use in my salon. It didn't come with any wires to connect it. When it was printing all garbled the tech support for Bixolon, who makes this for Samsung, said that my usb wire was a usb adapter and that the wire had software in it. So I got a new wire. The tech worked remotely on it for about an hour and still it didn't work. He said he thought that the printer probably needed a new interface card and that he could ""sell"" it to me. I don't think so. I said no, I'd rather pack it back up and send it back to Amazon. Amazon was awesome with the return and credited my card immediately."
2,I hate it!,"I hate it! It works, but after it prints, it feeds out about a 10 inch tail of receipt and I'm like wtf! Can't get it to stop! POS! I knew I shoulda spent more and got the one Iwant, but at the time, just starting out my new business, didn't have the funds.Maybe I'm missing something, I don't know. Otherwise, it works great! If you can fix that issue, let me know, and it would make this pos printer an A- printer."
5,MISSISSIPI JOHN HURT: SO GOOD IT HURTS !!!,"After listening to Mississipi John Hurt in this pretty neat cd, it's quite probable that you will start to sing ""God Bless America"". Here are blues, as blue as they come, with only guitar as companion. This stuff can truly becompared to a Homer-like Greek blind poet strumming epic rythms on a harp... YES, IT'S THIS KIND OF EPIC FOLK POP MUSIC, something like French singer-guitarist George Brassens, or Brazilian bossa-nova hyper-sophisticate Joo Gilberto with his guitar. Some stuff in the USA redeems America, AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM ! THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGINS !!! Forget Ella Fitzgerald, drop Big Mama Thornton (NO! not the Big Mama! Stay, Big Mama, stay! drop Billie Holliday instead!), flush away Sachtmo and Anita O'Day. Music and poetry and zen simplicity are here all together, just a simple, inexpensive cd. A MUST ! TOP MARK ON THE MIRTH-ENNUI SCALE. Perhaps civilisation is not ending after all..."
2,Ughhh.....,"Once again, WotC's D20 system claims another casualty. This book carries on the crass misportrayal of the Drow as a race of dominatrixes in Boris Vallejo strap outfits, whose primary vise of their universe is sexual perversity. They mutilate the Drow pantheon, and while much of the artwork is indeed beautiful and well-done, there is a particular emphasis placed upon depicting pointless nudity and fetishist situations. Much of this book, I found sickening, and it wasn't the graphic descriptions of violence.That said, there ARE some useful things in the book, like a description of Drow name honorifics, and some of the aspects of society have thankfully not been tampered with by the fanboys. Some of the subraces are interesting, particularly the Drey, and the martial arts styles are a blast. Just.....avoid the bits about the Drow society centering around leather and whips, and please keep the mind out of the gutter."
5,Assistant Golf Pro,"Just reading the discription, and looking at the cover has me excited about getting this book. My group of players are usually up to there necks in drow intrigue. So this should help flesh out our adventures nicely. Not to mention that on occasion, I have a drow player character."
3,A.Bourgeois in Texas,"This fanny pack is a nice leather pack. However, I purchased this for an elderly person and the snaps on the front pouch were extremely difficult to snap---a zipper would be better!"
4,Rick Astley Reboot,"I have a confession yo make. I still have my old Rick Astley vinyl record Whenever You Need Somebody and it is probably 24 years old now.There is something eternal about 80s music. Twenty years ago, silly teens like me partied our brains out to this. More than two decades later, youngsters of a different generation are still bopping to this at 80s theme nights.Rick Astley looks so shy and sensitive on the covers that it's hard to picture him doing extroverted dance music. This collection more or less sums up his greatest (and my favorites) up till 2002. Everything including Never Gonna Give You Up, Together Forever, It Would Take A Strong Strong Man, Take Me To Your Heart, Cry For Help as well as the non album track My Arms Keep Missing You are here; with a new track called Sleeping rounding this off."
2,"Great descriptions, no character development.","This is the first and only Denis Johnson book I've read, and it wasn't a good one. I'd heard such great things about the author that I was very very excited to start reading this book. I was more than let down by this book. I didn't even finish reading Angels, and that's rare for me. Don't get me wrong, the man's a talented writer, but a horrible storyteller, and if you don't have both you're worthless to me. I've been told that Denis Johnson's short stories and poems are better than his novels, so I plan on checking out Jesus' Son. If you want to learn how to write reading Denis Johnson would probably be helpful, but if you want to say something ignore this book. Read Ask the Dust by John Fante for great writing, and great storytelling."
3,a good read,"A good story line with some unexpected twists . A strong loving father was a positive character . Family traditions held and adhered to were exposed as useful as well as done by rote with little understanding of the reasons or actual initiation of the practice. Brought into view family secrets and how they can damage/impede family relationships . The mental health aspect was not fully explored adequately or discussed with regard to the presentation of symptoms ,generational aspects and most importantly treatment. There appeared to be some commonly held myths regarding mental health that were incorporated into the story about""bad blood"" and generational curses with little exposition of the truths of same. Characters were vivid ,believable , funny and often called to mind members of one's own family with their idiosyncrastic behaviours."
3,Required a lot of work to get working,"I got this because I was getting a carbon fiber hood with no ports for wiper fluid nozzles.I was able to get this working, but be advised that you're going to have to buy about 5-6 feet of new wiper fluid tubing (cheap at pep boys or any auto parts store) and that you may have to shave off edges on the mount to get it to spray properly. I had to use an x-acto knife and some sand paper to get mine to work properly.If you're handy with projects like this you should have to problem, once I got them working on my Neon SRT-4 it worked terrific. Also solved the problem of fluid missing your windshield at high speeds."
3,Boobs look a little pointy,"This bra supports pretty well but it makes my breasts look a little pointier than I'd like. Overall, I am satisfied"
5,Great Bra!,This bra is great. I am a 38B and it does what most other bras don't - the straps stay up all day long and it is comfortable all day long. I love it.
2,Not for 32 C or D,"This looked good on paper, but it's just an odd fit. Even at the smallest hook, the back slides up, and does not provide secure support. I only reach for this one when all others are in the laundry.Keep looking if you are larger chested and want support."
1,"BAD, BAD, BAD! COUDN'T BE WORSE!","We bought this camera at Toys R Us for only $19.99, but thought that it would take fair pictures. We tried to load them onto the computer the message stated that there were no pictures to load. We tried reinstalling the software 3 times, to no avail. Camera flashes, but there is no way to see if it has taken anything. This is a piece of junk! Your better off spending a little more and getting your child an older used canon digital camera (powershot A40) from the Amazon marketplace sellers."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!,"I wouldn't have even given this review 1 star, but since there's no option for ""0 Stars,"" I went with it! We wanted a camera for our 6 yr-old son to take pics on his own, so we wouldn't have to worry about him damaging our camera. He got this one for his birthday and went around taking snapshots of the party. When we got home and downloaded the pics, we found that the software is not user-friendly, and took quite awhile to even figure out how to access the pictures. Once we figured that out, we discovered that NONE of the pictures that he took turned out. The pixel quality is so poor that it's worse than even e-mail quality. The flash didn't work, so all of the pics were dark. ABSOLUTELY do not buy this camera if you're expecting ""real"" pictures."
4,Very helpful for digital B&W pro or amateur,"I have been shooting B&W on weekends, or off-hours, for more than 20 years (using 35mm film most of the times). This book helps me to understand the digital side of B&W. It will be very useful for anybody, pro or amateur. Makes you a better digital photographer. Strongly recommended."
3,L.S.G................T.I.G.H.T!,"This cd from lsg is a tight combination of 3 of the best males in R+B. They made a good cd the first time around and had hlep from Puffy, Jd, and a few others. ""My Body"" and ""Curious"" are some tight cuts. The best slow jam on this album is the one with Coko/faith evans and Missy. On this song Missy shows u how much she can really sing. Of coarse everybody else blows this song and just make it tight. Overall this is good and if u didn't get it while they were out back then? ..then now might be a good time."
5,Lots of memories,"I am so glad I bought this cd (again). When I listen to the songs now, they bring back so many memories. Listening to one track, I realized that it was a song that my son, at age 2, would mimic because he was learning his ABC's and the song starts off with the singers saying the letters of their last names. Too cute. Now, I play it for him (age 13) and recount the story about how he enjoyed repeating what the singers said while sitting in his little car seat. I'll have to never lose this cd again!"
4,I Miss Them,"and TGT (Tyrese,Ginuwine,and Tank) cannot equal these three. The strength of the writing, the videos, and the selection of the collabs are unbeatable."
3,Great CD,Even though I'm not a big fan of Keith Sweat-- his voice mixed with the sultry sound of Johnny Gill and the oh soo sexy voice of Gerald Levert makes the CD worth buying.
5,The best of 3 great singers!!!!!!,"I""m not sure what took them so long to get together, but it's about time. While the three blend together like a fine wine, they also still have their own style. R&B fans this is worth the wait. I love them as indivual singers but I'm very happy that they got together on this. I can't wait for another album from Levert, Sweat,& Gill. I'll be the first in line to buy it without even hearing any of the songs. I just know it will be the BOMB!!!!!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I have tried to force myself to listen to this CD. I found myself trying to trade it off to someone else. I really expected the trio of singers to really pull off a hit, but I guess it was not to be. They should stick to solo albums."
4,Three giants of 1990s R&B.,"Released at a time (late 1997) when traditional R&B music's appeal had been almost totally wiped out by Hip-Hop's domination of the Urban market, this CD was a breath of fresh air for those who (like me) love Old School R&B. Of the three singers, Johnny Gill comes across as the most soulful and convincing but it seems as if the real stars of the show are Keith Sweat and Gerald Levert. This was definitely one of 1997's best R&B CDs (especially when compared to the junk and crap that has been passing for ""R&B"" since the early-1990s!) but the use of rappers and Hip-Hop beats was really pointless and at times annoying. It's all too obvious that Levert, Sweat and Gill have deep roots in 1960s-'70s Soul but this effort (while not really bad) could have been MUCH better."
5,good item,"I use a lot of Rubber Stamps for crafting. And these work wonderful to hols the stamps, Will get more when I need them."
3,Works as advertised,"Nothing good, nothing bad. They hold cards as you would expect them to. I didn't find a card that didn't fit and if you're careful when pulling cards out then you won't rip the pockets."
5,Works great,"I got this to help organize my Pokemon and Yugioh cards and it works great. It's nice and sturdy, but still flexible enough to be able to flip through my binder quickly."
5,great for any collector card,"great for my boys' collections of yu-gi-oh, pokemon, and other misc cards they pick up along the way. sturdy, durable sheets--this is a winner"
4,Sturdy,These were bought for couponing. They are made of sturdy material that doesn't crack or tear easily like some pocket pages. I would recommend these for any use someone might want them.
5,"Great Price, Great Quality","Note: I purchased these with the intention of using them for a coupon binder.These pages were cheapest cost per page I could find after shopping at local stores versus amazon, and because of that I was happy to start.Now that I've put my coupon binder together, my first impression is that these pages are of high quality. I have also collected baseball cards in the past, and remember sheets similar to these that would rip easily at the tops of the pockets. After multiple handlings, I don't believe these pages will rip. The seams between pockets seem to be very durable, and the plastic is quite thick.Given the fact that they seem very durable, and via amazon they were half the cost of other sheets, I highly doubt I will be altering my review."
5,High quality,These sleeves are made of heavy duty and crystal clear plastic. The top pockets are deep enough that you don't need to worry about your cards being damaged.
3,Sports Trading Card Protector Sheets,"The sheets were received as advertised, met the need and seem to be durable. Unit price seems a little high, but were the most economical to be found on-line.As a side comment, the questions asked above really don't apply very well to this item."
4,awesome for coupons,"I use the trading card sleeves instead of coupon sleeves, due to the way I organize my coupons. They just fit better!"
5,Great product,"These pages fulfill their intended purpose (though it doesn't do well storing coupons :3) successfully and with ease. They're excellent, reasonably priced and very helpful."
3,Beware - can't do middle range!,"It isn't obvious from the description, but this device can only do about 2"" drop to 7"" drop and 2"" rise to 7"" rise - it cannot do anything between +2"" and -2""!"
2,Not infinitely adjustable,"The description says infinitely adjustable between 7-3/4"" drop to 6-1/4 rise. It is not. Description should read: Adjustable between 3-3/4"" to 7-3/4"" drop and between 2"" to 6-1/4"" rise. It is not adjustable or able to be set between the 2"" rise and the 3-3/4"" drop. If you know you will be out of that non adjustable range then it is a good hitch to vary the height of your ball hitch. If you load your vehicle/trailer and end up in the unadjustable zone with your trailer not level or the not the right tongue weight, it is not worth anything."
1,Junk......,"I bought this hitch because my truck (Toyota Tacoma) has a 6 inch lift and this hitch gave a pretty good drop. The idea behind this product is great, but the product is junk. This will do what you need it to do (pull a trailer at the proper height), but there is a lot of play (wiggle) in the adjustment area of the hitch. If you are pulling a trailer that you don't care much about and you also don't care much about your tow vehicle than this is what you want. I anticipate that if I use this hitch very much that it will break because of the excessive play and cause me big problems. I'm ordering a B&W; Tow & Stow hitchB&W; TS10049B Tow and Stow Magnum Receiver Hitch Ball Mountand throwing this master lock in the garbage."
3,"nice, but heavy","when my wife opened the box, she thought it was a men's watch. she commented on the heaviness of it when she put it on. we also had to have some of the links removed, b/c it was long."
3,Women's watch? Really?,"I bought and returned this watch because I have a tiny little wrist. I wasn't really impressed when I initially saw it out of the box. The watch, itself, is considered to be women's, but I thought it was a men's watch upon first seeing it. I suppose it could pass for ""unisex""? I like the whole concept of a watch not looking like a watch, but for me the cons of the watch outweighed the pros.Bottom line...Pros:-Bought it for $100, thank you Amazon!-Watch doesn't look like a watch with the face cover-It is Dolce & Gabbana ;)Cons:-Heavy for small wrists-A masculine women's watch"
3,Huge bracelet!,"This watch is essentially a bracelet: huge and heavy for female hand. You don't realize how bulky it is by just looking at the picture. I bought this watch as my wife's birthday present at crazy sale $99. My wife did not like it, so I sent it back right away. Amazon refunded me full amount, thanks! Be careful if you buy from other sellers at amazon's marketplace: not all of them have such a great return policy (could be restocking fees, less shipping etc.)"
4,very useful book for the hunting shooter,"A great book that covers much more than just shooting technique. Highly reccomended for the new hunter and for the more experienced there is plenty to discover too. Covers such topics and calibre and rifle selection, ballistics in the field and shooting positions in the field. Many more usefull topics and information. It was refreshing to read a book that does not buy into the short magnum cartridge hype. A very balanced and reasonable shooting manual."
2,Not a great source for landscaping ideas,"Based on the description, I believed this book would be full of design ideas and photos of well-landscaped pools. It isn't. If you are looking (as I was) for examples to show a landscaper (or to do it yourself), you should look elsewhere."
2,Not a book for plants!,"I had high hopes due to high reviews, but I was very unhappy to find that only a small section of the book is actually about plants! You would think with a name like ""Poolscaping"" that the book would have had more to do about plants and landscaping around the pool. The book is instead divided in chapters about how to build a pool and many pictures on waterfalls and spa's. Very generic as a whole."
4,what I needed to know,"This book was an excellent resource for the designer looking to work with swimming pools. The ilustrated examples and artistic tips were an invauable inspiration for sparking the imagination when designing pools. Before reading this I did think of pools as slabs of concrete filled with water, but I believe this book has put far down the path of being able to design elegant swimming pools. I consider this a must read for any architectural designer."
1,Not so good,This is one of the not so good books for pools like many many others. I don't know may be it is too hard to write for pools. There are inside some pictures but nothing to catch the eye neither spectacular. THis book was suppouse to guide you how to create your own pool but I have see much better books!So if you are going to spend money to build a pool keep on searching for another book!
5,"Hilarious, Fast and Funny Journalism Story","This is a wonderfully funny little novel set around the life of a reporter at a midsize Midwestern newspaper in the early-mid 1980's as the newspaper business was rapidly changing. On the surface, the newspaper is transforming as foreign backed and profit-minded owners move the paper from the era typewriters/typesetters to computers and high speed presses. At a deeper level, you also see how far modern editors and publishers have moved to raise the shock level to sell copy. Most importantly, however, it is simply a wonderfully witty little novel that is still hilarious twenty years later. It is too bad, Mr. Sawislak appears to have written no other books. I highly recommend this - if you can find a copy."
5,Terrific!,"This is an excellent book that chronicles the making of the legendary screen classic ""Gone With the Wind"". The book moves in chronological order from it's start as a novel all the way through the pre-production, production and post-production stages of what was to be one of the greatest films of all time, if not the greatest. The book is filled with numerous photos, some of them in color, many of them rare and all of them crisp and clear. There are close-ups of all of its stars (Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Olivia DeHavilland, Leslie Howard), the crew at work, movie posters and it's world premiere. This is a great book that will make an excellent addition to any library!"
3,gwtw,"I ordered this book and it was shipped to me very fast. It has many high quality black and white photos, but the color ones were fuzzy, a little blurry. In all my service was great, but i just expected more from the actual book..."
4,Great CD...But an awesome show!!!!!!!!!,These guys were 20 years ahead of there time I've seen them five times . If these guys tour again go see them you'll love them. ROCKSOUTH SOUTHERN ROCK AND BLUES BAND
5,White Witch is great!!!,"I need some help. Back in the early 70's there was this song on a Witch Witch album (the cover was White and Silver lettering ""White Witch"" as I recall. I'm not sure of the title of the song, but it started like this: ""It's the class of 2000, we were wearing silver suits that year. Mom's hair was slick, she looked like a rooster and dad's was way past his rear"". I need to find this song. My daughter is graduating in 2000 and I want to play this song at her graduation party. Please help me find this!!!"
5,Bout time this one came out on CD,"I have tried for years to get Capricorn to reissue this and ""A Spiritual Greeting"" on CD. Glad they finally got the message. My albums are almost worn out. Just about everyone I have turned onto their music in the past 25 years have begged me to record it for them. I saw White Witch live in Sparkle City (Spartanburg, SC) back in 1974 at the old Midnite Sun. Hope there is a tour in the works. Can't wait to hear ""Auntie Christie\Harlow"" remastered. Does anyone know the release date for ""A Spiritual Greeting""?"
5,the best there was the best their is and the best there will ever be,"I remember buying this album at Record Heaven in Griffin ,Ga and still have the original two lp's recorded by this very talented group of individuals. Ron Goedert is by far the greatest vocalist ever{ yes that includes Robert Plant }I remember telling my best friend {KV Have you ever thought of changing}that I found a vocalist that could hit higher notes than Plant.Unfortunately,due to the popularity of groups such as Led Zep-Deep Purple and other great bands of the seventies White Witch did not get the credit they so rightfully deserve.This album is brilliant from the beginning to the wonderful closing lyrics of ""This is the power of White Witch""-FYI the pictures on the lp are from Rose Hill cementary in Macon, Ga -RIP Duwayne Allman and Butch Trucks-"
1,Pathetic Sound Quality On This Red Fox version,"Yes, it's cheaper than the legit Capricorn version, but you get what you pay for. This is a pathetic, flat sounding recording made from vinyl. Instead, spend a few more $ and get the legit Capricorn label version listed elsewhere on Amazon while you still can, since it has been out of print since the late 90s."
5,This one's a must for lovers of great rock music!!!!!!,"Finally! This album, now on CD, is truly a masterpiece of originality. This band was way ahead of their time and now their time has come again. Thanks Capricorn Records and thanks Amazon.com. Looking forward to a possible third album from a great group."
5,White Witch has returned for the Class Of 2000!!,"It's about time that this long out-of-print gem has finally seen the light of day again~~an under-appreciated and overlooked classic! ""It's So Nice To Be Stoned"" was practically the theme song for my life back in high school! :) This CD has me eagerly anticipating the upcoming release of their second and even greater album ""A Spiritual Greeting""!! I'm sure that ""Class Of 2000"" will likely become the theme song for the Millennium~~we'll all ride high in the saddle again, my friends!! :)"
2,It's not the same when you're not stoned.,"In 1974 this was THE album for cruising and getting stoned. I've looked for it ever since my 8-track version wore out and was ecstatic to find it at Amazon. But it just ain't the same 25 years later, without the drugs. White Witch's proto-metal feels too pretentious these days. Still, I find myself humming some of the tunes and am glad to have it back in my collection."
4,The Mature GB Color,"Where the GBC fails, the NGPC takes off. Sure, the choice of games isn't as diverse as the GB, but that grandaddy has been around for near as I remember, 10 years! The neo-geo pocket color has better games, and better graphics than any other GB game i have seen."
5,better then gameboy or gameboy advance,this is the best handheld gameing system out there the color is great and the it really clear if your into fighting games this is the system to get the only thig that is bad about it is that thay dont make games for it any more. i think there is 46 games out in the us but all the games on it are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great system - title support needs to play catch up,"I bought my NGPC in NYC on a trip being unable to find it in my part of country. I have been very pleased with most of the titles I have played on it. It is an amazing little box. The only downside is it's lack of games out for it and how inaccessible (hard to find local stores that carry games) it is too most people. It needs more quirky original games and fewer fighters. A higher volume of games, even if the quality would suffer, would greatly improve its market standing.SNK will confidently continue development on it and give GBC a run for its money."
4,Better Wait,"The NGPC is a good handheld game system. I do admit that it outperforms the Gameboy Color, but just wait a few months until the Gameboy Advanced comes out and it will be worth it. You can play all existing games on the new GBA plus it will be way better and improved than the GBC. Before you go and buy the GNPC think twice about saving your money until the new Gameboy Advance comes out in the fall."
2,a gamers review,i remember getting this from my friend back in the day i have some complaints well first of all the system's durrability drop it one time and bam! you will here something loose inside then my other complaint is that it only has like fighting games that are just knock offs of street fighter and mortal kombat my conclusion dont buy it it sucks!
4,YAWN!,"NGPC is a great handheld system. I admitt it does outperform the Gameboy Color. If your thinking about buying the NGPC for its better resolution, sharper screen, and brighter colors but still enjoy the Gameboy games, I'll save my money and put up with the Gameboy color for a few more months, for the arrival of the newest gameboy. Gameboy Advance which will surely outperform the GNPC. But if you have enough money go ahead and buy the GNPC. I'm gonna wait."
1,This is one of the worst GPS units,"The coordinates are slow to load, I bought a GPS unit so I don't have to make U turns. I make the same amount of U turns that I would make with just having a map printed out online. My unit I bought new for 200, but during the 6 months that I have owned the unit, it has been out of commission for 2. I had to sent the unit back to the factory twice already for servicing. My unit errored out twice with an error message ID:4100. The hard drive crashed on the unit. If I were you I would not be fooled by the price and go with mio or garmin."
1,It sucks!,"The GPS unit is mounted on the front windshield.1. Without the antenna, it takes forever to get the GPS lock or no lock at all. I am talking about hours!2. With the antenna, it works better but occasionally it does not get GPS lock for at least 30 minutes!3. You better follow its navigation instruction. If you don't follow its instruction, may be 2 times, the unit freeze. This is a software bug!As a summary, it has GPS signal reception problem and software bug. I am an engineer who designs GPS vehicle tracking unit. This model definitely needs more engineering work to make it a competitive product."
3,"Tick-Tock, Not Tock","I love everything about this watch EXCEPT the loud tock sound. I could even live with a tick-tock like the old windup watches, but this single clicking sound, so loud I can't wear it to bed, drives me nuts."
3,"leather strap is burgundy, not brown","This watch is just as expected EXCEPT that the leather strap is burgundy colored, not brown. I opened the box, pulled the little plastic piece off to start it and set the time, put it on and then realized that the color is not as described or expected."
2,Boring and Trite,"I bought this cd and sold it back the same day. MFTMA had it's sappy moments, but overall I think it is a great cd. It sounds like he is trying to make a hit out of every song on DIF. Maybe a couple will be, but I feel like he is trying to play it too safe. He reminds me of a sedated Jeff Buckley, which just makes me want to listen to Jeff Buckley."
1,Pete Yawn,"In the words of Cracker, ""What the world needs now is another Eddie Vedder, like I need a hole in my head""."
1,Mmm...dislike this record even more now!,"This is a pure sophmore slump. There is nothing here that is interesting, unlike Yorn's first outing which was great. And what's with trying to sing like Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. That's annoying!!After trying again...When i first listened to this record...i hated it. I played it for a few months off and on. Didn't like it at all. Wrote the review above. Then i put it away for a while and listened to other things. Well finally...I tried again to discover what some call a ""timeless gem"". If musicforthemorningafter was ""for those autumn days strolling in the park""...day i forgot is a the day I put this away for good and forgot it."
3,Hard to improve upon debut albums,"Day I Forgot isn't as good as musicforthemorningafter. Get that thought out of your head. It's nearly impossible to improve upon a masterpiece. What Pete Yorn has done with his new album is give you more of the same, which does its job here. Songs are short and a bit overproduced, but they sound great. Whereas tracks from the first album build upon one another, these tracks bleed together and are hard to tell apart. Pete Yorn's songwriting talent and ear for rock & roll just proves that a good album from him is much better than another band of the week's best effort."
4,Good Stuff,"""Carlos (Don't Let It Go To Your Head)"" is the best thing Pete Yorn has done. ""Crystal Village"" is also gold. This album sounds a lot louder than Musicforthemorningafter. A lot more swagger to it. This guy deserves all the praise he gets....and lacks."
3,"Not the second coming, but a solid album","I think ""hooks"" would have been a better title for this album, which is a collection of just that: catchy hooks sung with a sincerity and emotion that made Pete Yorn's first album such a hit. However, the lyrics are not as deep as Yorn's first effort, which may have some fans thinking this album is a bit of a let down. But give it a few listens, and you'll find yourself with the songs stuck in your head, and the CD stuck in your car stereo."
3,Better Than Many Reviews Suggest,"This is actually a 3.5 star album. Clearly, it doesn't have the effortlessness and near virtuosity of Yorn's first album. And the trademark PY sheen that is on every one of his tunes sometimes masks the emotive essence embedded in his songwriting. But this is definitely a solid power pop album in the best sense. One hopes PY can expand his already formidable songwriting sensibilities, but there is much to enjoy about this album. Each listen brings new revelations, there is more complexity than originally meets the ear. Certainly worth the rather inexpensive sale price."
2,Good....Just not as good,Obviously not too much can measure up to MFTMA but this is a decent record. It does sound a little like a contractual obligation album though...not too much that's particularly ear-catching. Pretty disappointing actually.My biggest beef with Pete is the fact that there's so much extra material out there on CD singles and soundtracks. This album's pretty short...throw something extra on besides that ridiculous home video!
2,Disappointing sophomore,"Pete's debut MusicForTheMorningAfter was absolutely brilliant. Personally I can listen to it once a day from start to finish and i'm still far from getting sick of it.After much anticipation patiently awaiting Mr. Yorn's oh-so important sophompore release, unfortunately Day I Forgot does not come close to having the same impact as MFTMA. Not all is bad on this album but I find myself skipping through certain weaker songs to get to better ones, which I do not have to do on MFTMA.Not much lasting power on this one."
4,All you critics...,"What are you all on about? It's obvious that this album is nothing more, nothing less than what Pete Yorn intended it to be. Yes it's a lot more poppy than the last album and seemingly more simple but everything fits together quite nicely. The lyrics and chord progressions are basic as hell but these days it requires a great deal of talent to make something so simple sound this good."
3,Not bad,"Although I could attempt to pretend like I write for the Rolling Stone and rate each song from one to five based on deep characteristics such as ""music"" and ""lyrics"", I will save you the pain. I will just say that I enjoy this album, and though it doesn't quite match the quality of his previous release, not many albums today can, but it's still worth purchasing. It's good garage rock that's friendly enough for anyone to listen to (And the thirteenth song is omitted for the obvious reason of the unlucky 13, ...). Pick it up, and enjoy."
2,No Music for the Morning After here,"A bit of a let down after the fantastic debut album.Lyrically simple and trite,musically a pale shadow of his previous effort.The stuff that sounds the best is reminiscent of Morning After.Check out Josh Rouse,a similar artist with three fantanstic CDs and the last was a masterpiece."
2,"A disappointment, but with hope","Pete Yorn's 2001 album ""Musicforthemorningafter"" was a masterpiece of a debut. It seemed to exist on a Zen plane of music--never hyper-saccharine, never mindless, always imaginative--which is amazing for a freshman effort. Unfortunately, ""Day I Forgot""'s songs seem to either unimaginatively update their predecessors, or they become either ""emo"" or mechanically-written rock songs. Keeping in mind that further listenings may narrow this two-year chasm, I would tentatively keep the possibility open for another star or two."
2,Day I Forgot is unfortunately easily forgotten...,"I have had this album since it was released back in April 2003 and feel it's only fair now to give it a proper review after having absorbed it for quite a while.After highly anticipating Pete Yorn's sophomore album, ""Day I Forgot"" didn't immediately grab me at first like his brilliant debut album ""musicforthemorningafter"" did, but didn't want to give up on DIF too soon for the sake that my expectations were probably too high.It has now been 7 months and DIF unfortuantely just doesn't have the same lasting power and impact that Pete's brilliant first album has to make you want to keep going back to it.Other than 3-4 decent songs on the album, Day I Forgot doesn't seem to make its way back to the CD player anymore as it has instead found it's way to the shelf.Hopefully Pete's 3rd album will have the same power as his debut."
1,sophmore slump,"just another sophmore slump offering after a decent debut, nothing catchy here, and if you don't beleive me check out how many are selling (or not) in the used section of amazon."
2,Could use a little Simonizing!,"This CD very closely resembles musicforthemorningafter without any of the good bits. Highly disappointing! It seems like the sophmore sets delivered up by many of todays ""hot new artists"" are just close imitations of the songs that made them famous. More's the pity."
2,Disappointed,"I really enjoyed ""musicforthemorningafter"" and was a huge fan eagerly awaiting the next CD. I've given it more than a couple of listens and really find myself really disappointed with this effort.Download a couple of songs before buying this CD!"
3,musicforthemorningafter the Day I Forgot,"Pete refers to this album as an extension of musicforthemorningafter in the 'Making Of' extra, and he's right on. Albeit a little harder than his first effort it's the perfect mix of new rhythms and instruments, complimenting his earlier work extremely well. His voice in 'Carlos (Don't Let It Go To Your Head)' sounds eerily familiar to Bono's in Bullet the Blue Sky (just a first impression; I immediately thought of that song when I heard 'Carlos', for some reason). There's nothing as soft as 'EZ', 'Lose You', or 'Just Another' here, but 'So Much Work' is extremely well done, and one of the best tracks on the album.While not as good as 'morningafter', this one's still got stuff for both newcomers and already-hungry fans."
3,Not even close to the Real Pete,"When I first bought this album I did not care who said what about it. Pete's first release was totally awsome, by far the best last year. MFTMA will be played in my cd player ten years from now, when it gets scratched, I will by another copy.But this album does not compare to MFTMA. I gave the album time. Maybe it would grow on me??? Alas, it did not. I tried to like this album, I really did. And even if it is better than most popular music, it is not Pete Yorn at his best. The real moment of truth-to decide whether I really like the cd or not-came when I put in MFTMA. I could not deny it; Pete set the bar too high. That is what you get for making a masterpiece, it is just too hard to match it."
5,"""Day I Forgot"" Is Absolutely Wonderful!",Pete Yorn is so wonderful! His music speaks the words I could only wish to say myself. His lyrics are beautiful and heart warming and very true to his soul. Everyone should own this album!
2,Does not meet expectations,"To give you a little background, I once said to a friend, ""If I could have made any album ever, I would have made musicforhtemorningafter"" (Pete Yorn's debut album). Sure, the statement is a little strong and I may have been drunk, but the point remains: PY's first album was incredibly beautiful, earnest, and just about note-perfect.This album is not. I had high expectation for this album--they were not met. There a couple very good songs, several mediocre ones, some poor joints, and 'Burrito.' The very fact that PY wrote a song called 'Burrito' and sings it with a straight-face means I should get my money back. I mean, listen people: the song is called Burrito! Unbelieveable.So there it is. The 'Intro,' 'Come Back Home,' 'Crystal Village,' and 'Man in Uniform' are good additions to the PY oeuvre. The rest is unnecessary--just like this album. Save your cash and check out The Shins, Interpol, or British Sea Power if you want something interesting."
5,Still Great,"Standing in the store, I happened to notice that Pete Yorn had a new album out. Having loved the previous one, and an added bonus of the cd being only $8.99 which I think is a great deal, I didn't hesitate to pick it up. Pete's music is the kind I just put on and completely chill out to. Personally, that's what I love about it. My favorite part about his music is the music - the guitar, piano, his voice, and every other instrument which so nicely meshes together into something great. To be honest I don't even really notice the lyrics much. It's just what you (ok, I) need to relax. Currently, I'm working on getting my friend addicted too (I think it's working)!"
2,Nothing Special,"I'm not sure where the buzz about Pete Yorn comes from. His voice and his songs are average at best. He's also fairly limited as a singer, using the same monotonous vocal style on every song. It's interesting to me that record labels rave on and on about how an artist must possess something original and special to get a contract and then sign someone as mediocre as Pete Yorn. Do yourself a favor...skip Day I Forgot and get the new Radiohead's new Hail To The Thief CD instead."
2,Musicforthebargainbin,"Wow. I bought the first album and loved it. This follow up stinks. Luckily I only blew [a little] on it. I don't recommend it. If you have the first album think of all the songs you skip through, lower the standards a little, and you've got Pete Yorn's new album. I am going to see him in concert and hope he doesn't play a single song off this recording."
5,An overlooked cd with momentum,"I had a chance to see Pete Yorn live, and his second album captivates a more audience friendly types of songs. I happen to adore the album along with it's covers for his sound of his voice. Although some beg to differ that he is too much pop, I beg to differ. He tries to incorporate different genres and style throughout. It's also refreshing because he doesn't stick to the normal pop sound nor does he stray into some mindless overdramatization of rock. He keeps it simple and sweet and keeps an avid music listener hooked... a great songwriter, a great showman, who simply isn't advertised as a boy band and stays true to his listeners. Great potential.... great cd."
5,GROVER!!,"I have spoken Mr. Washington several times on this site, and the same goes for this disc. BUY IT!!!"
5,So he CAN sing!,"After hearing him only in the background on my many Boyzone albums, I'm glad he finally came to the front and soloed. His voice is beautiful and he's so talented. I look forward to hearing more from Mikey!"
2,horrible Public domain transfer.....,This is very hard for me to enjoy as its obviously taken from a broadcast and is of dubious origin. The poor quality of the picture make it so hard to enjoy...I'd pass. If you want a good quality Clayton Moore DVD ..get the lone ranger sets or the movie on VCI as its very good!
2,Barely watchable print ...!,"I was looking forward to watching this movie as I'm currently on a Clayton Moore/Lone Ranger binge!! This could have been a lot of fun - even though the movie is standard 1950's ""B-movie"" fare and Clayton Moore turns in a rather ho-hum performance. The comedy relief offered in the film is not very funny, but the action scenes are mostly well handled.The big problem is that this is such a rotten copy - I'm not sure what the source material was - but it's very hard to watch. I'd agree this deserves a pass until a better print is offered!!"
4,An Awesome Old Film,"An Awesome old film,another in a fine line of those who have portrayed Buffalo Bill.This a must for me,being a Clayton Moore fan.Is kinda nice for those of us who have always seen him portray The Lone Ranger,to see him out of that role,and in something else.He still has that demanding voice,and that spin of the guns that some of us love.If u are a fan of old westerns,and if u are a Clayton Moore fan,this is a film for u.Have fun watching!!"
4,Great Music,The Alan Jackson cd has a lot of great music on it and enjoy listening to it on the commute to and from.
4,Good video,The DVDs for the greatest hits #2 are great. This is not as entertaining but still enjoyable.
2,Might have been a great book with color,"I found the book well-organized and quite lucid. The author clearly understands the program well. The book's Achilles heel (and probably the reason for its relatively inexpensive price) is that there are only a few color illustrations in the center. All of the other illustrations are done in low resolution B&W, making it nearly impossible to appreciate the techniques or changes in images. If the publisher had raised the price a few dollars and done the illustrations in color, the book would be vastly more valuable."
1,Cover Art as a Loss Leader,"The only well printed page (in color) is the cover. The book is printed in material that is virtually newsprint -- extremely hard to read and illustrations are poor as a consequence, some to illegibility. The book is in no way an improvement over the original Adobe manual -- or rather, it is in no way comparable. A waste of time and money."
3,If you're looking for a great EVP recorder ...,"...then this is it! Or at least one of the best. Other than that - it's not good for much else - at least from what I hear. But all I use it for is for EVP recording.For those morbidly curious people like me - who just have to know what's in the dark...this records what the human ear can't hear and plays it back for you...It's actually fun, once you get the hang of it and if you're not a woose about this stuff. I still have my first set of goosebumps from the first time I heard one call my name...ooh! Spooky! :D Happy hunting!! :D~ Former Skeptic"
2,There are better ones out there:,"This commentary falls way short in its interpretation of Daniel. I'm giving it two stars because there are bits and pieces in the book that I find insightful. But over all, the author spends more time refuting rather than expounding Daniel. This is not the primary commentary to get for sermon or teaching preparation. There are better ones out there. Try the New American Commentary series or the Word Commentary series."
3,Supplement Needed,It cannot be used alone as a social studies curriculum. I have used several other books with this one to develop a complete social studies curriculum.
1,Not Microwave Safe,"These cups are not microwave safe. You can spend a similar amount of money on Pyrex and have something that will be far more useful. As plain measuring cups, I found them to be overpriced and awkwardly designed. I'm sending mine back so I can't comment on the usefulness of it's features."
2,Space Saver but Bad Design,"At first I loved the Zyliss Mix-N-Measure Stackable Measuring Cup Set with Lid. It's attractive, it stacks, it pours well, and it's light weight. I have not used the lid, however I appreciate the inclusion as it would be useful for some people I'm sure. Now that I've had the set about six month, I am noticing that the red lettering (which is a little hard to see anyway) is wearing off. Up until now, my biggest complaint would be the red lettering. But I can see that the set will eventually be useless as far as accurate measuring is concerned. I'm very disappointed as I looked around a long time before choosing this set, which was not inexpensive. Also be aware that it cannot be washed in the dishwasher, nor can it go into a microwave. Needing to handwash was okay with me, but the microwave restriction was limiting."
2,Has many problems.....,"I bought these because I wanted a liquid measuring cup larger than 2 cups and the stacking ability appealed to me.First it is a little strange to be able to peer down into the cup and see the measurement. The plus is that it is on the side as well.The lid only fits the 4 cup measurer which for me was the cup I have used the least.The most upsetting aspect of these cups is that the red writing has not held up. I have never washed them in the dishwasher and yet the writing on the most frequently used 1 cup measurer is now illegible which has made it useless for measure.After this experience, I have decided that glass still makes the best liquid measuring cups.Do not waste your money on this product."
2,wearing out,"I like Zyliss products. We have the garlic press, pizza cutter, chip clips, etc. But these measuring cups haven't held up. They're not microwave-safe, which is fine. But they do claim to be dishwasher safe. But after less than a year of regular use, the measurements are wearing off the cups. And apparently this isn't because we put them in the dishwasher, because another reviewer, who hand-washes his, is having the same problem. I'm disappointed. I've used both Pyrex and Anchor-Hocking glass measuring cups without a problem for years. They're not stackable, but they are microwave-safe, and the lettering has never worn off. Back to glass for me."
2,looks can be deceiving,When I ordered this I thought that it would be sizable enough to blend my deserts up in the set and then using the lid be able to pour the mixture into something like cupcakes a lot cleaner than in a regular bowl. Only the biggest one has a lid and its hardly big enough to blend something in
4,Decorative and functional,"I must admit I thought this product would be bigger, but they do work quite well and are decorative too. Can't say I'd stick a mixer in the large one, but I guess it could be done. Love the fact that they nest into one another and save space."
1,Don't be tempted to buy these because they are Zyliss,"I am so frustrated with these measuring cups. Yes, they stack nicely, and yes, they are easy to read. But the design of the pour spout is sub-par. It is tolerable on the 1 cup, but it is nearly impossible to pour from the 4 cup without the liquid dribbling down the side of the cup and spilling. I have tried pouring quickly and pouring slowly ... it is just too much effort for a measuring cup! The lettering is wearing off and the acrylic has cracked in spots (although they don't leak). I've had them for a little over a year and they look awful. I have loved most of the Zyliss products I've bought, but these are awful. I could not recommend them to anybody, and just replaced my own set."
1,Disappointment from Baby Einstein,"These blocks were a big disppointment here. As noted by others, the sensors are very particular and it is sometimes difficult for the parents to make the proper connection to elicit the music from the blocks let alone my 14 month old (or 4 year old). Definitely something that needs to go back to the drawing board for redesign, so go buy some other blocks."
1,my baby ate the paper and metal off the toy!,"This toy is hard to figure out, my 8 month old rarely got the blocks lined up right for the music on her own. Plus, when she put them in her mouth, the pictures came off as well as some of the metal connectors that must contact each other for the music - I guess she ate them! I do not suggest this toy."
1,Terrible toy,definatley NOT for a 6 month old. I had trouble figuring it out and I have a college degree! The colors and pictures have to be lined up perfectly to work. The only use my 9 month old gets with them is throwing them across the room!
5,One of the best mix CDS of the nu school breaks,"How many times have you bought a mix album only to find that the DJ has taken the last half of the album off, that is, he's not cutting and splicing tracks like he or she did in the 1st half? Friction and Spice break this tradition and have put out one of the best mix albums around. It truly has the illest selection of breaks and non-stop scratching...you will be amazed with this album...outstanding work..."
3,Family,"The book arrived ahead of the specified time. The book is in average condition, where the seller stated that it had some dog-eared pages and such, which is fine, but it has clearly had water damage or coffee spilled on it at some point. Overall still functional, so not really complaining, but the condition stated is not what it is in."
1,"HORRIBLE, DOES NOT REPRESENT VIEW OF MOST CHRISTIANS","Horrified is the key word here. I am horrified at Andrews' views so much that this is the first book for which I am writing a review. I am a born again Christian, I know my bible and love the Lord but and am sickened by Christians who take this viewpoint, and sad to think that other people think this is how Christians operate. Andrews' advice to a friend about his daughter, and the description of him and a male teacher ""FORCING"" a 6th grade boy to submit to corporal punishment 2 or 3 times in a row, then each time forcing the boy to put his arms around Andrews' neck to hug him back, is SICK. MY ADVICE IS - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I cringe at Christians like this, and feel very sorry for their families and the people who are influenced by or affected by their viewpoints. The only reason I gave this book one star is because I couldn't give it zero or minus stars. Andrews made a few good points but there have to be better books out there."
2,Not really what they say it is.,"I'm not sure what they call leatherette, but from I'm from this ain't it. This isn't even made of good canvas that you know will last as long as you need it to, but instead it's made from that material that's coated with a light plastic inside just to keep it together for a few months with a zipper that's just as dodgy looking. My advice would be to keep looking if want something worth the while or get something much less expensive so you don't get that ""sucker"" feeling that I have right now."
1,Guardian Case for Recorder,"This is a joke. There is no way this is letherette. It is just regular material. This is a rip-off. I always trusted Amazon products before but I'm going to be very wary from now on. There's not even room to put a swap and cork grease inside and no, the zipper does not have a pull tab. I'm very disgusted and disappointed in this product."
3,cool(but could have been better),"well there is a good news and bad news to this cd.first the good news:it is exteremly hard,the music and vocals are extremly solid.this album is something you can totally bang your whole body to.the lyrics are pretty insane and tight.and they put a pretty good christian message in their album.now for the bad news.the songs are extremly and i mean EXTREMLY short most songs are barely over 2 minutes and 20 seconds and there were several songs that were barely a minute long.your able to bang your head to the music,but right when you start the song is over.i dont know what these guys were thinking but they are too short.it does however have 12 songs.but they were so short that this album should have been released as an e.p.and should also have an e.p.price instead of a full length price.all in all its pretty mediocre.buy it if your a big n.i.v.fan"
3,i dont buy cheesy Christian music,"one word:old school.niv's music is exactly that.you have all these people saying that it is too short,well, to tell you the truth i am glad it is that short. they sing in the most insane way that i have heard,the music starts off hard and never lets up,so a song that is a minute and a half to two minutes is about all i can take of them.you cant understand what they are saying,he sounds like he growling instead of singing,this may sound like i am being negative,i am a Christian,and every cd i have is by a band that calls themselves Christian.niv is good,there music quality is phenomonal,they play extremely hard,that is the only thing i look for in a cd,is the music hard,i dont care if they even sing,lyrically any Christian cd will be good,but i only buy bands like EDL,POD,NIV,PROJECT 86,BLINDSIDE,MXPX,STAVESACRE,FIF RODLAVER,SUPERTONES(there middle cd is the best one).as for my fav song,that would be white washed tomb."
4,I WASN'T DISAPOINTED AT ALL,NIV'S 3rd cd has a great hardcore sound it rocks star to finish and if your fan you must check out this cd i hope rescue will reisuse the first 2 cds though cause they were even better than this one but NIV fans need check this 1 out anyway
3,For School,I had to buy this for a university class. Just didn't get much out of it. Maybe the book could be taught a little better. It just didn't give me anything new aka it reconfirms common sense.
5,Wonderful translation of a amusing story,This is a wonderful translation of a piece of classic Chinese literature. The subject matter is amusing and can easily be appreciated by westerners. The standard of translation and the editing are exmplary. Recommended.
2,More like a synopsis only,"In my view, a book on outcome measureshould be full of examplesThis book is only like a synopsisjust commenting of what outcomemeasures are available and whetherit is validated.Not a particularly outstanding workI am afraid to say."
4,Good Pond Pump,"I have had three of these pumps. I expect to get about 2 years of use in a 1200 gallon fish pond operating a waterfall and pumping about 7 feet vertically to a pressurized filter. They have a high flow rate and put a good volume of water through the waterfall. The pump does have a tendency to clog with acorns, plant roots, leaves, etc. and has to be cleaned weekly to maintain volume. There is no way to use a prefilter since the inlet is a number of slots in the bottom of the pump. It will shut off if there is not a sufficient flow through the pump. I had to have one on pump replaced, but I got good customer service and a quick turn-a-round."
1,Be Very Carefull!!,"I have had my sp350 for three weeks now. Looks Great, Accessories Great, Sound is Great, But it does not always work. A place a regular CD in it and it skips while sitting on a desk. Placed a MP3 CD and it skipped. Got a lot of Garbage ASCII codes insted of the songs. Tried removing the ID3 option. That still didn't work. ..."
1,"Good Product, but do not purchase","Good Features...Not Durable at all, bad Tech Support (from my experience with the sp250 and 350..when they sent me a replacement for my 250, it did not even work, and they are very slow with emails...after 1 month of use, just started displaying ""No Disc"" for any type of disc, and Tech Support has not responded yet...it has been about 3 weeks since i emailed...similar problem happened with my SP250"
1,How could they?,"Really a shame, because the RIO 90, 100, and 250 were way ahead of their time and excellent pieces of equipment. I have tested all plus other brands, but the Rio 350 is just junk. It's not even thin."
1,Horror story!,"I am not going to repeat all the things that other people mentioned in the same sentence with RIO VOLT (e.g. skipping, bad support, etc.) I am only going to add another story. I bought mine at the BOSS store (it was heavily discounted), so I thought - ""What'ta hell!."" Bought it in Florida. Returned to GA figured out - no batteries! NOBODY ON THE INTERNET sells replacement batteries - NOT EVEN RIO VOLT THEMSELVES!!!!! Everybody, I urge you to BOYCOTT THOSE SOBs. This is not a right way to treat a customer at all."
1,"The newest, the worst","I had the SP100 player that I loved, it was a very good player and each firmware update gave me a lot of interesting functions. Unfortunately it was stolen from my car and then I wanted to buy another one. I saw the SP350 with its very nice design and I thought that if SP100 was great, this one might be outstanding, but what a dissapointment. Lot of buffer, for what? It skips all the time, a lot of CDR discs it doesn't read and its firmware is a lot less complete than the SP100. There's an unlimited list of things you can't do. I hoped that maybe the upgrades could fix those lot of BUGS it presents but I have turned to stone waiting for them. What's wrong with you at Rio Volt? If I could I'd like to return this junk and buy another one."
1,This player sucks,"The customer service sucks and the player sucks. It skips all the time, even on sturdy surfaces, and picks up weird radio stations I cant even find on my car radio. except for that its great! Did i mention that it skips all the time?"
1,"Priced to Move, but it's a dog","I'm returning the second Riovolt SP-350, which we got from J and R. Both units had a display which turned into gibberish at times, and a very poor quality FM tuner. I live within 20 miles of most Twin Cities stations but mostly got howling. Great feature set and included options, but now you know why the price was lowered and the product was discontinued."
3,Caution,"I bought it, and...ah...hummm...it's not that ultra-tin, to say the trught it's not at all thin, it's the same size of all the others cd players.. and i't have a lot of bugs, I hope a new firmwire resolves it, but it's a good player for $60"
1,Hopeless piece of junk (There should be a 0 star option too,Please donot buy this RIO SP350 player as it is a smart way of daylight robbery . I cannot believe that I spent 60 $ for this c**p. Anyway the best u can do is go to a store and check it out and return it ... I have so many skips in my mp3 CD's ...The worst player so far ...My recommendation : Move on and go for a SONY Player ...
1,Believe the other reviews. This player is terrible!!!,"I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this MP3-CD player. I saw it in Circuit City and thought that it had a lot of features I liked, so I purchased it. What a big mistake!Problems:o Skips on regular audio CDs (even when sitting still)o Skips and pops when playing MP3 fileso Jumps from one MP3 file to another IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FOLDER (?!!)o Fails to recognize folders (showed strange Japanese characters)o Fails to recognize some MP3 CDs AT ALL!I've only owned this player for a week. How could I have encountered this many problems in such a short time? I actually exchanged the player at the store today because I thought I had a defective unit. From reading the rest of the reviews, I realize I have a defective product.Don't touch this player with a 10-foot pole. I'm returning this player tomorrow and getting the iRiver SlimX iMP-350 CD/MP3 player instead."
1,Do Not Buy...,"Got first unit, skipped and was very iffy reading CDs. Also, had glitches in software. Called Sonic Blue, first told me get a cleaning kit for their brand new CD player! After a little more discussion they had me send back mine and sent me a new one. This one is even worse. It is unusable, skips on various CDs and menu system is buggy. Do yourself a favor and wait until the next version of software comes out."
1,The worse,"This is the worse MP3 player I ever owned, first the batteries are proprietary, not AA as was advertised. It also skips and out right refused to play some MP3's even after I put them on a brand new CD. After I did that I put the old CD in a friends MP3 player made by memorex, it worked great. It's also not any thinner than a normal one. My recommendation, stay as far away from this frightful thing as possible."
3,"nice, but too many bugs.","In one word:Disapointed.The good:Price.Features.Built in batteries.Nice design.The Ugly:Horrible FM reception.A few skips here and there when plays mp3 content.Too little setup features.Controls are not 100% easy to use.Beta release firmware with lots of problems.Compared to:Rio volt SP100 (2 years) - with latest firmware - flawless performance and ease of use.Conclusion:Unless they release new firmware fixing all the problems, don't waste your money on it."
1,Truly a terrible player,"I bought this thing after hearing the praise of the sp 250. At first, I had problems with the display listing garbage instead of song titles, but dismissed it as thinking they will get a new firmware up... this was not the case. their website which is truly terrible has no info or support on the 350 and their customer support line is even worse. You wait for hours and then they just hang up on you.For a product that says ""won't skip"" it skipped a lot. I wasn't even jogging or walking. I was just sitting down listening to music on it.The radio is garbage too. When they say FM tuner, they mean static tuner.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this. I am going to return it and get an ipod instead."
1,Bad service and bad product,"I bought this cd player because the 250 was great and i tought that the RIO brand was very good. But what a surprise, the device was failing since I put it to work... I wrote to RIO and they never reply to me and I have been waiting months for them get out any update to the firmware.Rio is not what it used to be... you cannot trust the company anymore."
2,Disappointing,"I have a 90, 100 and have tried the 250 and the 350 leaves a great deal to be desired. It does not handle files well, can read only a limited number of files, does not have resume and is difficult to navigate. The older models have superior firmware. Perhaps SonicBlue will fix these problems with new firmware. It should have been done before release to the public."
2,iRiver iMP-350 is a Much Better Choice,"This player is similar to the iRiver iMP-350 MP3/CD player, but a better display (4 lines instead of 2) and better accessories make the iRiver unit a clear winner.Also, my experience with SonicBlue's customer service has been less than favorable (and this is being kind.) It has now been almost a year since I sent a broken player in for warranty repair or replacement. After half a year (!) they replaced my original player with a different, lower quality, model (SP250 with SP350). But it has now been a year -- and they still not have sent me accessories for the SP350 (which is incompatible with the old accessories.)"
1,Don't Bother,"My review is quite simple. Don't buy. I got the unit for Christmas last year and dealt with the skipping for a little while, but then returned it when it was static like in the car. After getting a second unit from Amazon, I found the static problem somewhat improved, but now noticed that the unit had a nearly impossible playing MP3 CDs. SonicBlue says clean the lens (of a new player?) and burn CDs only at 128kbps. This is not the performance I expected. This is poor. Now I'm stuck fighting with SonicBlue to get a refund. This product is not worth $...Get an IPod."
2,Sent it back after 3 days of trying.........,"After playing with it for I finally gave up. I really wanted FM, unfortunately the reception is so poor it's almost pointless to have it on there! I only picked up a handfull of stations, none of which I listen to.The CD player stored so many tracks into memory and once then quit playing once the stored songs had been played. It was supposed to store the next 30 or so tracks and keep playing. I only got it to continue once or twice.It plays plain old CD's fine. Unfortunately, this costs way too much for just a plain old CD player!"
1,Maybe I got a defective unit,"It looks cool, has a lot of features, comes with lots of accessories, the batteries last a long time -- this seems like it should be a great player, BUT...- The radio won't tune correctly to stations below 91.0 or so - it just keeps receiving the bottom of *its* range no matter what the station is set to- It won't read some audio CD's that I tried, saying ""no disk"".- It won't read a CD of MP3's that I burned, replacing the contents of some directories with random ascii chars.- It seems to chop off the last second of some of the MP3's- On one of the MP3 CD's that I burned, it chopped up about half of the songs into multiple songs, resulting in a blip as it goes from one to another -- i.o.w., it will list a song three times with playing time for each one a third of the total time- Sometimes while playing MP3's, it will randomly jump to the middle of another MP3 in another directory"
1,stay away,this unit has good intentions; has good accessessories and features. however it is a piece of junk. it constantly skips between songs. i tried contacting rio techncial support and their only answer is that you shouldn't use it for walking.They also recommended not to record at 128kbs or above; i had not done either of these things. the unit skips even when sitting stationary.Rio need to change the firmware. they should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this unit to stay on the market. there are no faq's.
1,Great until it stopped working,"I really liked the design and features. It worked great for 6 six hours until it came up with ""read errors"" on the same disc it had previously played. It won't read any disc, CDR's with MP3s or regular CD's. The worst electronic purchase I have ever made."
2,ipod is much better,"this is an overpriced cd player. it is ultra thin, yes, but if you want something small you really want an ipod. Using a CD player in the car is not about getting the cd player to be as small as possible -- it's about making it as easy to use in the car. that said, here are the positives:this cd player is cheaper than the ipod.overall, don't waste your time with this product."
2,Too little... too late !,This mp3 player is no where as good as others on market. Rio took too long to get a decent product out and that too is overpriced. It skips and the sound quality isn't that great either (with better Sony headphones).Have you seen a uglier design than this ? Probably not.There are also some nice flash based mp3 player from iRiver.This product is not worth your time or money.
2,Terrible,I changed it 4 times and i gave up on it the 1st every thing worked pretty good exept the batteries lasted like 2 hrs on it so i changed it 4 a new 1 then the 2nd one was horrible it skiped even when flat on the table i couldt beleve it so i went back and got a new one on thr 3rd one the radio didt work at all on any of them it worked really good but on this one i didt work at all and on the 4th one hte same thing i couldt beleve it cus the actual cd was great good sound quality and really good exept the radio well over all its allright is u get one dat dosent skip and u dont want a radio but i after all went for the sony 1 with the small screen dat got mp3 and radio/tv/weather its pretty good no complins so far
1,Another Horror Story,"Brand new out of the box, doesn't recognize most discs. Even store bought music CD's. CD-R's, MP3's ... forget it! Don't even think of wasting your money!!!!"
1,awfully awful,Didn't work from the beginning. Was told later this was a re-conditioned product.Don't spend your money on this product from this company
2,Mediocre player,"Skips, stops, becomes unresponsive randomly (u can't turn it off) There are no firmware upgrades available to fix these flaws. I got this player with the car kit for $60 over christmas. Now I see it is $170, how is that possible? RIP OFF!This player is barely tolerable.CAVEAT EMPTOR!Translation:BUYER BEWARE!"
1,A lot less than expected,"This isnt as thin as you would expect. The sound quality is not as impressive as you would expect. The price is not as good as you would expect. This is the most dissappointing purchase I have made.Heres WhyThe Seek time to load an CD full of mp3's was about 25 seconds (no joke!)Takes about 5 seconds to change a song.Can only fast forward at 1 speed. Only about 3 times faster. That means to get to the 3 minute mark of a song would take 1 minute.Sometimes the display would just turn into all crazy characters, forcing me to turn of the player and wait another 25 miserable seconds for it to load.The car kit didnt work i dont know if it was the car's fault or the car kits but the sound quality was terrible.Skips easily even though it claims ""32 minute skip protection!!!!""Just dont buy it. Its plain and simple. There is not even a chance that you will be happy with your purchase."
3,had to modify,"we had to modify this product to fit the way we needed it to for our chevy spectrum, kind of a pain, but they work for us..."
4,Excellent resource for the family of gays and lesbians.,"This book provided insight into the dynamics of ""coming out"" for gays and lesbians and the reaction of family members. I bought this book for myself as a sibling and my parents who are questioning and doubting themselves in relation to the fact they have one gay child, i.e. ""what did we do wrong?"" The book provided insight into the basic social and spiritual questions that arise in the minds of questioning parents. It was wonderful, insightful, and it made me more comfortable with this topic regarding discussions with others as well as my family. It also had some very helpful additional resource information in the back. It's definitely a lot of book for a little bit of money."
1,Coffee cup writing,"This book gives every impression it was written at the writer's kitchen table, probably while watching the T V. She gives the illusion of extensive research, which the text does not live up to. Suggest the author stay with a day job if she has one, if not perhaps she should start looking. Extremely boring!!!!!!!!!"
5,Love Bosch Power Tools,"Currently own a 4.5"" grinder, 7"" grinder, and chop saw from Bosch. All have worked fantastically and have been extremely durable / reliable."
4,Advanced Home Wiring,"I purchased this book at the same time that I purchased Black and Decker's THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO HOME WIRING, thinking that it would take me to the next level and provide me with additional information. In a nutshell it was merely an abridged version of the aforementioned book and added NO NEW information. It was easy to read, and easy to follow, but omitted some of the basic background information that their other book included. I think the novice home electrician could get by with either book, although I give the nod to the COMPLETE GUIDE..... as a more helpful and a more thorough instruction and reference book."
5,Second 1/2 of the new one,"Published in 1992, a follow up to the Basic Wiring and Electrical Repairs book put out also by Black & Decker, this book has great photos and easy to understand explanations covering how to do more complicated electrical tasks. While the first book was repair and maintenance, this book moves into renovation and remodeling, with chapters on project planning, tools & techniques, Wiring a Room Addition, Wiring a Remodeled Kitchen, Installing Outdoor Wiring. From this book I learned how to install new breakers in the main fuse panel, a project I was terrified of trying. This really is a very good book for the non-professional. Now the two books are combined in the 2001 The Complete Guide to Home Wiring by Black & Decker"
3,Describes pre-construction wiring,Buyers who expect this book to describe wiring for completed homes are in for a rude surpise. This book details wiring for a home under **construction**. But the other details like photographs and description are excellent.
4,OVERALL IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND EASY TO FOLLOW.,OVERALL I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT BOOK. LOTS OF PICTURES WITH GOOD DESCRIPTIONS. I DID THINK IT COULD USE SOME MORE DESCRIPTION ON SOME OF THE DIAGRAMS. I AM AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL TECHNICIAN THAT IS HELPING A FRIEND WIRE HIS HOME AND WILL BE USING THIS BOOK TO HELP WITH THREE WAY SWITCHES AND THE 240V CIRCUITS. IT DOES HAVE SOME CODE REFERENCES AND GOOD TIPS ON WIRING CIRCUITS.
1,absolute ...,"I can’t deny the fact that this book is anything less than what it claims to be—a biography—among countless others, a partial account of John Lennon’s life. Another important fact about this book is that it is an extremely careless attempt. David Stuart Ryan seems content in skimming over most events he recounts rather than attempting to discuss any of them in depth. So what’s the big secret according to Mr. Ryan? He offers nothing more than a pseudo-psychological, amateur, freudian analysis. Ryan claims that since John Lennon didn’t grow up in a “normal” family setting he was perpetually in search of an adept mother and father figure (Cynthia, Yoko and Brian Epstein served as candidates). On another note, if the zodiac’s your thing, you’ll love this book and will be drooling over descriptions such as “Cynthia’s virgoan faithfulness,” and John’s “hedonistic libran inclinations.” Enough already!"
5,A milestone album!!,"At the time I bought this album, just after it was released in 1972, Southern (Blues)Rock was the big thing. And I am still a big fan. Alex Taylor was (then) unknown to me. But what a revelation this album turned out to be! It's absolutely perfect in every sence. The studio band is really hot as a unit and in the solo's. Guitar, piano and organ are stunning. But best of all are Alex's beautiful blues vocals. Excellent choice of song material too. It's just all up there with the best. When the CD-era arrived I gradually got rid of my LP collection, which I now regret. But there were a few LP's I couldn't part with , and Dinnertime is one of them. I got the CD allright but I'm still holding on to the LP."
5,need more Alex,"Alex was the best of the Taylors and this is a great album, but I think that Capricorn should re-release his ""with friends and neighbors"" album...his rendition of ""Southbound"" is one of the best recordings I've ever heard."
5,From confusion to clarity,"For far too long Christian women have felt confused about the issue of submission. Many Bible verses, taken out of context and isolated from the verse that precedes, as well as the one that follows, have been used to teach unhealthy, ungodly forms of submission and to support an un-Christlike agenda within the Church. Brenda Waggoner gives context and caring counsel to women at all levels of spiritual maturity, leading them to wholeness and toward a more fulfilling spirituality that allows them to experience God, express their gifts and use their talents for the building up of the whole body of Christ. This is not an angry book; it is an important book for all Christians, men and women alike, offering deep insight not only into the heart of a woman, but also into the heart of God."
5,Life Changing,"Brenda does an excellent job breaking down the myths women believe and why they are not Biblical. Don't walk into this one thinking it is just another book on how to be submissive to your husband. That is a very SMALL part of the bigger picture; How to be submissive to your God! A must read for women who desire a closer relationship with their Father and an honest, integrity filled relationship with others."
1,about the book,its great and is very educative.makes one really understand the word racism and prejudice
4,Find This Place,"Grover Washington Jr. had experienced massive success with his prior two albums, Mister Magic & Feels So Good, which mirrored each other in their heavy funk sound. On his next album, 1976's A Secret Place, he moves away from the funk and creates a more laid back sound. The title track has a dark, atmospheric vibe with riveting sax work. ""Love Makes It Better"" is more upbeat with a stinging guitar and a bouncy electric piano throughout."
5,Classic Renata,"To say that these 12 disks contain some of the finest singing ever committed to disk is no exaggeration, but a simple statement of fact. Historical fact. In the 100 years (more or less) that Puccini operas have been around, only a few sopranos in each generation have been the equal of Renata Tebaldi. One cannot objectively say that anyone has surpassed her. Some opera lovers find her peerless in many of these performances. Personal tastes in singers vary, but no one ever sang these roles better. Few anywhere nearly so well. There is not a single note on any of these recordings that is not heartfelt to the core of her being. Like Maria Callas and Franco Corelli, she was luminous, gargantuan in her talent that personified an age. This is one of the great compilations."
4,"Next to HARDCORPS, this ranks as one of the best","For those of you who have yet to lend ear to the evil conveyed by Hardcorps, then you must buy this compilation. The beats are hard, underground, and unlike the weaker ""hardcore"" mentioned by the individual beneath me, the baselines are banging and it shies away from the heavy metal head banging style and sticks to the house/techno roots that so many of you New Yorkers love. The Remix of ""Slaves to the rave,"" is superb and for those of you who enjoy hardcore foot flipping over at Sound Factory, you will love this. It is the European hardcore that you are becoming accustomed to and more than ever, growing to love. A few songs are a bit weak, but overall, this compilation is superb....worth buying.Check out HARDCORPS...the compilation is beyond belief."
4,The book is amazing,"Dogs are my passion, in this wonderfully written book I've found that I am in GREAT company. It was well written, some of the stories could have been shorter. But it made me laugh and cry, and after almost every chapter I was amazed at what I didn't know about the people in the chapter. The research was extensive for this book. So if you love dogs and you love history you will really love this book."
3,Eh.,"Entertaining anecdotes, but not really what it promises. It's more a collection of famous people and their beloved dogs with a few notes (some of them are real stretches) about how the author believes the dogs might have affected them. Not particularly convincing, but sweet."
5,Dark and Fascinating,"This is a very dark novel. It is also compelling, suspenseful, unusual, and fascinating. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those who are fascinated by twisted characters and want to know how their minds work, even a bit about how they got that way, this book works really well. Zeltserman is an excellent writer who keeps the plot moving at a dizzying pace."
2,Great idea,"I like the idea of using these templates to cut out pie tops, but in reality they are very difficult to use. I would not recommend them."
5,our kid by billy hopkins,you need to sell billy hopkins on kindle its great reading for my travels .a lot more people would buy.dm
4,Mark Lowry Unplugged & Unplanned,I must not have read the Amazon description too closely so I was a little disappointed. Mark Lowry is a singer and a comedian. With the album title I thought it was going to be mostly comedy but it was mostly singing. Still it's very good. I was just really in the mood for some of his comedy.
4,Great material !!!,"Seems to be great so far, comfy that is for sure !! Impressed with the way it looks on my lady."
5,Great product,This is a great product....My wife really liked it and she looked awesome in it. It is easy access if u know what I mean...Would reccomend this product for sure...
4,pretty hot,"For reference, I'm 5'6'' and 125lbs and the length of the legs just barely fit so I doubt it's truly one size fits all but sexy if it does!"
3,Doesnt fit like the picture.,"I bought this for my wife because it looked really nice. (all you men know it does). But the front covering the chest area doesnt look like the picture. It actually will pull the chest flat (my wife isnt) but it kind of smooshes them I guess you would say. The plus side about this product is when she wears it, you cant feel the fabric, it feels like shes not wearing anything."
3,welllllll......,"It looks good, except I'm tall and it's not exactly one size fits all. I had to fight with it to get the legs all the way up, and then I had to keep pulling them up, which is hard because of the crochet pattern. And, because I have to stretch it so much, it looks more like a patterned fishnet.Also, the tag is in the front, near my armpit. Kind of a strange place, so I removed it very carefully (hoping that it wouldn't unravel the whole outfit). Seems ok so far, but I haven't worn it out yet. Fingers crossed.I don't dislike it, and it is basically as advertised."
1,Way too out of date but the lessons were good for a short time,I have appreciated the Step by Step series for years. The lessons are short but practical and teach the things you really need to know. This is a useful guide but unfortunately out of date. Don't get it.
3,In very good condition..and...complete,The MS Outlook 2000 Step By Step book was in very good condition..and...even contained the accompanying CD.
5,Our Father's Plan,"This is an excellent source for anyone interested in deepening their faith though understanding the Bible. Conventional ""read these verses each day"" , though disciplined, don't give you a broader context to hold your interest and deeepen your understanding. Great vehicle (one minor nit, you need to obtain a self-study tool from EWTN- could have been included)"
1,Can't rate this one,"When I saw this request to write a review on this dvd, I couldn't believe it. I can't write a review, mainly because i received audio tapes, I can't return them because i don't have the bill of sale. I can't hear them, because I don't have a tape player. Sorry"
1,Not educational; not fun.,This book has nothing to recommend it other than some diagrams of the chords that are found on the different types of instruments. Buy something else.
4,easy assembly,"by far a very simple assemblty process, the only true complaint about this piece is the base it is unfinished and cheapens the final appearance."
2,What can you expect for a $50 end table?,The look is good but the craftmanship is bad. The directions were hard to decipher. The directions include numbers for all of the pieces (assemble-by-number) but the pieces themselves aren't numbered so in some cases you don't know the difference between right and left or front and back. I also put it together to find out that the track for the drawer was manufactured on the wrong side. The screw holes were not aligned properly so one screw didn't even go all the way in. I like the look as it goes well with some of my other furniture so I'm thinking about exchanging for a new one in hopes that this one was just a fluke.
4,A little tough but nice,Just bought this item. It was a little tough to put together. Some of the holes for the screws didn't line up well. It didn't take long to put together however. It does look nice and is the perfect bedside table.
4,can't do much better for the price,"The design is nice and overall I found it easy to put together. I can't say that it will last more than 5 years, but for the price it would be hard to complain. They do match nicely with my island retreat theme in my guest bedroom so I am a happy consumer on this item."
2,disappointing,"The stuff itself is alright but the sticks are disappointingly small, before yoy have rubbed your legs with it takes some time and I wanted them as a time saver."
4,Short but very good,"This is a must-have book for clinicians who are fond of hemodynamics and arterial mechanics. The only drawback of the book is not being so comprehensive. Nonetheless, i strongly recommend it. And i also recommend amazon.com not taking into account complains about delivery issues, as in this example. A customer had given only one star to this book because of delivery problems, but there is nothing this book could do about it. I give 4 stars, if page number is doubled in the next edition, i will definitely give 5 stars."
1,shouldn't be recommanded,"This is the worst textbook I've read, the contents are not well orginazed, and the examples are repeated more than once, ome of the variables are come from nowhere, I saw most of these example and almost the same words on somewhere else other than this book, those are published earlier,this book is not worth to buy at all."
4,Great book but not for Beginners,"Before tackling this book I would suggest having a basic understanding of the C++ Programming Language. The book is a good book to get those who have just completed something like ""The Beginners Guide to C++"" into more advanced concepts of the language.I do recomend the book to my friends and they have benifited from it as much as I have."
3,Don't really work for large stamps,"Bought these for the office, and didn't use them. They don't hold larger stamps. Gave them to my daughter for her scrapbooking--she loves them:)"
3,Very few recipes ....,"There is good information about mushrooms but not a lot of really ... useful recipes.For instance, I wanted to find some recipes on ""stuffed"" mushrooms but there were very few. I would not repurchase this book or recommend to a friend."
5,It is really accurate and easy to read!!,I purchase this clock to replace my old clock which just went dead recently. It is pretty accurate and easy to read. The price is hard to beat!!
2,you might now have a good radio reception at home..,"first thing I want everyone know is the *packaging* from this company is bad. I got this wall clock in 2 different shipment and everytiime the plastic host for screwing on the back side panel is *broken*, all 4 of them! Luckly I can still use super glue to stick it back. But if you think it is too much of hassle, you should avoid purchasing from this seller.The other thing I want to point out and warn you is the FM radio signal this clock rely on for adjusting time itself is not available everywhere. And the product description has failed to point it out for people to consider this before purchasing.The bottom-line: it is still a good looking wall clock and it runs pretty quiet. I still keep it on my wall."
3,Good quality but pricy,"I have gone through so many ""Wal Mart"" clocks that I could spit. What is the deal am I in some kind of time warp? Any way, I was visiting my wife in the hospital and notated what brand of clock they had, i.e., a Charles Leonard battery operated clock. So I ordered one but paid four times what I have been shilling out on ""dime store"" clocks that just stop keeping the time after a few months. I have not had the Charles Leonard clock long enough to know if it will keep accurate time. But if it does it will be worth four clocks that don't keep time. I bought it a month ago. So far so good."
4,about time ha!,Like this clock. It keeps good time and is a good size. I will say I think its overpriced. It doesn't look much different than something you'd pic up at a megastore for 6 bucks. I didn't want to go out and love amazon so I gave it a try. It does tick loudly in a quiet room. It doesn't bother me too much but might drive some nuts. Also mine came scratched. Not a big deal. Just looks like it cost about 2 bucks to make. Not bad but not the bes value out there.
2,just an average clock,This clock is nothing special. Its is not silent at all. I can hear it tick 20ft away in ambiant sound. Its just a plastic clock just like anything you can find in any retail store.
3,Charles Leonard Inc Clock,I bought 3 of them for an office. They are easy to read from far away - but up close they look sort of cheap and not fitting of the posted product name & description.
5,Good Clock,This is the perfect clock for our barn. Large face. Overall very happy with our purchase. We would buy it again.
4,beautiful,Nice clock. It has a Big face. It would be really good for someone with vision problems. Not too loud.
2,"Nice design, but small crack in middle of glass","Nice item, but my clock came with a 3 inch crack in the middle of the glass. Maybe this is mora a packaging issue... Not happy."
2,Loud ticker,"At night I could hear it tick from the other side of the room. Made entirely of plastic including the cover; the only thing that's ""quartz"" is the internal timekeeper. Overall it felt like this clock would be good in a classroom or institutional setting, but not in a home."
3,"OK Clock, Cheap Plastic lens","The clock works fine and looks nice enough at first glance. But hanging on the wall in my office it picks up a lot of glare from almost every angle. The clear lens on this clock is plastic, which would be fine if it was flat, but this lens is domed shaped. This causes a lot more glare than you would normally get and makes it very easy to tell that it is plastic from 20 feet away. I ended up ordering another 14 inch clock that was cheaper and had a flat glass lens. I would recommend going with the Equity byEquity by La Crosse 25509 14-Inch Commercial Wall Clockinstead of this one."
3,It ticks.,"Unless you're really focused on something else you will it will tick. You will hear it especially if your room is not a big room. It's not exactly the most elegant design either. But for ten bucks, it gets the job done. As in, I am able to clearly see whether it is time for me to rush out the door and catch the bus yet or not."
4,great for the office,this clock works just fine for the office. Large and very easy to read from across the office. Keeps good time with no problems at all
2,Cheap and a little noisy.,"It works, but it looks very cheap and it makes noise. The dial looks like paper. It keeps time fine, so it's okay for a utility clock."
5,Tic Toc I love this clock,"I bought this clock because I wanted a classic looking clock for use in our ""Homeschool Classroom"". Yes the ticker is audible, but I find it soothing and somehow comforting in the quiet of a room. The clock is large with a bold face that can be viewed at a distance. I have had it for 6 months and so far has kept an accurate time. Would highly recommend."
5,Patio Clock,"After reading the reviews of all the outdoor clocks, this one seemed like the best for our use. It was exactly as described and delivered on time. Although we've only had it for a couple of weeks, we are very satisfied with this purchase."
3,Good Value,"Good product- easy to read, keeps accuurate time, fits in with a lot of different decors. There is a ticking sound, but you get used to it- could be a lot worse."
2,A bunch of fluff with catchy titles,"This book is a an easy read that provides a few points and snickers on the topic. However, Eva Shaw provides way too much common sense instructions, which are redundant, boring and pretty much pointless to the topic of the book. Here is one of many examples: ""Every writer needs to take several breaks. Go for a short walk, right now, if only for five minutes. Get out of the office during your writing day. When you're walking, straighten your posture, breathe deeply and swing your arms. Go once around the garden, up and down a flight of stairs or to the end of the block and back. If you're absolutely, positively not the type to walk, stretching is also great to get the brain cells functioning again.""I guess I'm just not a writer, because I think this paragraph was a rather pointless filler."
5,Expert articulation and composition. Vinnie does it again!,"If you liked the earlier works of Mind's Eye and Time Oddessy you will absolutely love this album. If you are a first time Vinnie listener this is a MUST HAVE album. One take from this and you'll buy the rest of his CD's! Vinnie shows spectacular articulation and versatility in his latest works. Congratulations Vinnie on reaching a level of ""MASTER guitarist"" that few in the world will ever achieve!"
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"I just got this album today and can't stop listening. I also have Vinnie's ""Mind's Eye"" and now when listening to The Maze, I see the guy has just developed his playing so much. There were some great melodies in Mind's Eye, but also ""sometimes boring"" shredding. The great thing about this album is Vinnie plays many different styles. The songs are all unique too. I've listened to many guitar albums but this one really did stand out with its dreamy atmosphere. When comparing Vinnie to another guitar master Satriani, it sounds like as if Satriani's emotion is kind of commercial because of the easy listenable melodies and radio friendly tunes. Vinnie's got the talent to reflect his emotions to match Satriani's, but sounds much more different/unique. A great album from a great musician anda must buy for all guitar fans"
2,More Typical Shred-Fest,"It's hard to understand the enthusiasm that I've seen so far of this album by the reviewers here. They must all be hardcore fans who have followed Vinnie Moore since the 80's. I still have Mind's Eye and Time Odyssey as benchmarks for what neo-classical is (as well as Yngwie's Rising Force and MacAlpine's Maximum Security). This album is just your typical neo-classical fusion fare with mega amount of chops, bland melodies, and PERCEIVED feelings or emotions based on individual taste. I, for one, do not hear anything really worthwhile here. Vinnie Moore might have as much or even more speed and physical chops than Vai or Satriani, but certainly not in the brain or in the heart."
5,By far Vinnie's best work...,"The Maze is surpassed only by Passion and Warfare as the finest guitar work ever recorded.This CD is simply phenomenal. Vinnie shines on this CD like never before.While Vinnie has always demonstrated a precision that is second to none, his playing has lacked a certain emotional quality, that very few players can bring forth in their work. On The Maze, Vinnie captures that emotion on every track.His ability to incorporate completely different styles throughtout the CD, and even blend them flawlessly within a given track, is simply brilliantIf I had one complaint about this CD, it would have to be, that I believe Vinnie borrows to heavily from Steve Vai on certain tracks. If you are a Vai fan, you will pick up on that immediately. It is for this reason, that the reviewer who claimed that Vinnie blows away Steve Vai, is someone who's opinion should not be taken seriously.If you play guitar, or even if you love guitar, buy this CD."
3,Substantial notes to get lost inside,"3 1/2I was not thrilled to say the least with Moore's earlier ""Meltdown""- despite plenty of technical proficiency, most of the songs seemed to lack memorable substance to frame all the darting around on the fretboard. 99's Maze is a solid improvement from that period, injecting a ton more melody and meaning into these ten jams. While it is not completely free from the shackles of generic riffage, for a strict solo-guitar rock disc it is quite compositionally deep, with the potential to satisfy demographics beyond immediate shred-heads."
2,Worked well until it fell off...,"This item from Garmin includes temporary and permanent mounting stickers for your dashboard. The temporary one worked great until it didn't, rather unexpectedly, and the permanent one didn't work at all (though it may have been user error...). These Garmin accessories tend to be pretty nice quality, but man, you pay through the nose for 'em."
3,"Nicely Done! Good Acting, Lousy CGI!","Enjoyable. Not really that thrilling but the plot was decent and the acting was good. Think ""BELOW"" meets ""CRIMSON TIDE"". This is a low budget film and it's broken down into two parts almost as if they were part of a show and they were separate episodes?"
3,Could be better,You have to love David Jason to like this movie. It is an interesting concept but underdeveloped in the movie.
3,This is a guy movie,The plot is just average and seems very similar to an American movie that was out many many years ago.Sir David Jason is very good but the movie is average.
4,Love this book!,"The good: Dean's compassion shows and I love hearing his story and getting to know him a little better. Since I am an energy healer as well, I identify with many of his questions and the situations he has encountered. I appreciate Dean's contributions to the credibility of the field and would love to hear more from him.Less good: Dean's recommendations to only use energy healing for minor issues or as a last result. Energy Healing is actually beneficial and works in tandem with any other healing therapy. I also felt at some points that Dean was putting others down for not submitting themselves to the scrutiny he has endured. He seems to feel a real need to prove himself and to have others prove themselves as well.The book is worth reading as an interesting biography. I'm not sure it could actually teach someone to help to heal themselves or another, but it's worth a try."
3,A touch of Hope,"I saw this movie and it seemed very hopeful and I thought the real book would make a great gift, however, the person I bought it for just left it in the garage and never read it...perhaps not the greatest gift after all."
5,Excellent! A Must read for anyone seeking relief from pain.,I LOVED this book and am interested in contacting the author. I want to know if he has had any experience working with autism and or seizure disorders. If you can help me contact him please e-mail me!
1,Very Disappointing From the Start,"I had high ""hopes"" for this book but right from the start there were obvious fabrications in Kraft's autobiographical story. Having lived in Brooklyn I very quickly noticed references to non-existent places such as a ""tunnel running from the Prospect Expressway to Ocean Parkway."" I overlooked these as possible artistic license. But when Kraft tells the story of how, in 1973, his friend Buddy tries to get him to profit from the ""talking car"" by going to Atlantic City to ""hit the jackpot"" I drew the line. Kraft says he ""knew intuitively"" that his gift should not be used in such a manner. Well, Mr. Clairvoyant, your spirits should have told you that casino gambling didn't even exist in Atlantic City until 1979! What a disappointment!"
3,REVIEW BASED ON THE MOVIE BASED ON THE BOOK,"AS A SERVANT PASTOR IN MY LOCAL CHURCH, I AM INVOLVED IN THE INTERCESSORY PRAYER MINISTRY AND BELIEVE IN THE LAYING ON OF HANDS AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE HOLY SCRIPTURES. I AM WELL AWARE THAT GOD HAS GIFTED SOME WITH THE GIFT OF HEALING AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THOSE WITH THE GIFT TO COME FORWARD AND SHARE THIS GIFT WITH THE WORLD AS THAT IS WHY IT WAS GIVEN. THE ONLY GLORY THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN GOES TO JESUS CHRIST WHO BY HIS STRIPES AT CALVARY SET UP THE GIFT OF HEALING. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE GIFT AND USE IT AT ANY EXPENSE TO YOURSELVES WILL BE BLESSED MANY TIMES OVER AS LONG AS YOU GIVE THE FATHER GLORY! ONCE AGAIN DO NOT HIDE THIS GIFT BECAUSE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT! I WILL BE GLAD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE, WHY AND HOW YOU MAY HAVE COME TO HAVE THIS GIFT IF YOU PROMISE TO USE IT FOR THE GLORY OF GOD THE FATHER. MAY GOD BLESS YOU SO ABUNDANTLY AS YOU USE HIS GIFT TO YOU TO HELP OTHERS IN NEED."
3,SlooooooooooowSludge,This is a decent record but if you're not a die hard fan of Slow Sludge music then this is not for you. This is a three song album and one song is 23 minutes long. I would recommend any of Pelican's albums before this one.
4,Nice design and presentation. Well Crafted.,The whole piece is very well made and looks fantastic. I couldn't be more pleased.
3,Pretty Good,"always Dug Teddy Riley but He did His Best Dirt with Guy,Heavy D,Al B,Sure,Keith Sweat&Then Michael Jackson to Me overall.with Blackstreet He Hit a Homerun on there first album with Dave Hollister on as the Lead Vocalist.""Before I Let Go""&""Joy"" were my cuts.after there first album Only ""No Diggity"" held up for me.I wasn't feeling there Cover of Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"".Teddy Riley got a more middle of the Road feel out of Blackstreet than the cutting edge element He had with Guy.so this set like the Group on a whole was middle of the road with a few moments.there first album was pretty good&after that ""No Diggity"" covers it all for me."
3,Something is missing,"I've been one of Blackstreet first time admirer. The New Jack Swing sound from Teddy Riley is amazing. But this best of is missing something! Where are the hot ""u blow my mind"" and the latest ""wizzy wow"" ?? 2 bad 'cause these two deserved to be put on this album!"
5,Great collection...all great voices,"The band has evolved and produced hits and songs that bring so many emotions...""Joy"", ""Lord is Real""...well done Teddy and Chauncey and the whole team."
3,It does remove stuff but not that fast,"It works ok, I got some light rust in one of my muzzleloaders. I scrubbed with this for awhile, it reduced the rust but there is still some. I'm not going to spend hours on it, I shoot sabots and as long as I keep oil in the barrel when storing, it's probably ok. But I was hoping this would be more aggressive, I could have got better results with synthetic steel wool."
5,I am amazed by her talent and versitility.,"This is a CD that shows many sides of this young ladies talent. She captures, emotion insecurity and life with a voice and talent that defies category, it just is. Hopefully she will grace us with her presence for many years to come."
4,Not just 32 Flavors,"I prefer Davis' rendition of 32 Flavors to the less musical original (Ani DiFranco is a little too ethereal and breathy for my tastes), but the remainder of Blame it on Me leaves something to be desired. Though a good tune without good lyrics can leave you feeling empty, Davis too often has good lyrics without good tunes that are better thought about than listened to. Still, ""Lullaby"" and ""Blame it on Me"" are worth a listen."
5,Smooth,Her voice is fantastic. I've been addicted to this LP for over a year. I can't wait to hear more stuff from Alana.
1,Save your money - buy the single.,"It is hard to understand how a woman with such an interesting voice could create such an uninteresting CD. 32 Flavors is definitely worth checking out, but by the single and save yourself some money. Or better yet, buy Not a Pretty Girl by Ani DiFranco."
5,A great singer/ songwriter for our times,"Back when I heard ""32 flavors"" on the radio I bought the single. Eventually I got a little tired of it but what got me to buy the album was the second song on the single: Lullaby. This was and still is one of my favorites. I also love the following songs: Murder, which has an erie story to tell. For some reason it reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock and his attitude about suspense. Free has a unique feel to it and shows another side of Alana's singing. Turtle is another good tune because there's a lot of different instruments being used and the line ""Just when you're sure your life can change right before your eyes"" which I've experienced many times in my life. I also like the last two songs but mostly because they're just mellow and continue with the main feel of the album."
1,save your $$$$$$$$$$,"I wholeheartedly agree with ""raging fish Mike"" that her covers are much better than her own original songs. The problem is that they're not better than the original versions of the songs she's covering.Piece of advice? Go spend your $15 on a good burger and a beer. It'll be way more satisfying."
1,why all the hype?,"one of my friends RAVED about this album and told me i had to go get it or i was missing out, so i did. let me tell you, i should have bought it used for $1.80. i also should have realized that when people are willing to sell back a CD for less than two bucks, there's a reason."
5,Thick vocals and acoustic.,A beautiful rendition of Ani Difranco's 32 flavors. The husky songstress leaves no doubt in anyone's mind about her sudden rise to fame on Free- a happy SAD SONG. Finally someone who writes deep songs.
1,Mediocrity Defined,"I had heard good things about Alana Davis' work, and eventually made my way down to the record store to pick up a copy. Hmmm. Well that was a mistake. Her style is inoffensive and fairly bland and her lyrics border on teenage poetry. Her voice is not bad, yet she does not seem to channel it in any direction except for that of a mundane background cocktail singer. She does have potential, but she lacks originality or gravitas. Unless you'd be happy paying to hear a small-town Edie-Brickell cover band, I'd avoid this one."
1,completely flat and uninspiring,"I do think that Alana Davis has a very pretty voice, but someone should teach her how to use it. I don't think she sings so much as drones, she seems to have no vocal range at all as far as I can tell. The songs all sound exactly the same to me - flat and boring. Even as background music this album annoys the crap out of me. The sad thing is that I can tell people are going to view this as a good album, and that makes me sick. Get some originality."
5,She has a great voice,I bought this without ever hearing Alana before and I am very happy I did. If you are looking for new artist's you won't be dissappointed.
5,Blame Alana for a GREAT album,"This record is by far a jewel. On her debut Alana gives us a range of emotion and heartfelt prose. Every song is carefully presented and orchestrated to make you feel you're there beside her or that she is speaking directly to you. My favorite tracks are Free, Murder and Rest of Yesterday."
5,TRULY INSPIRED!!,"Every track on this cd communicates emotion and feeling. Alana's voice is sensual and luscious. I absolutely emerse myself in this cd every time I hear it. In the two years since I bought it, I've never grown tired of it and nothing I've bought since competes with it. I can't wait for album #2. Alana, don't keep me waiting!!!!!"
5,The Recipe for the Perfect Album,"1 Dose sultry vocals 2 Doses smart lyrics 3 Doses soulful blend of jazz, R&B, & intelligent pop musicBuy cd, pop it in the player, turn down the lights, sit back.You just prepared the perfect album. Go Alana."
2,Mismanaged,"Alana has potential and could do so much better than this and her other albums. Her voice is good, but WHO lets her do so many covers? Also WHO lets her choose those album covers? I do not blame her for this. She's just been given bad advice by some idiot(s). You wonder why she hasn't taken off? Because she hasn't found a manager or producer who will take her to the big league."
1,So-So Music,"This album's just OK. I got it as a gift and I had never heard of Alana Davis before. She has a couple decent songs, but nothing special. I don't know why all these reviews rave about her music. I'm confused. I wouldn't recommend buying this new so get a friend to burn you a copy."
1,A Proper Place in History,Alana Davis has no soul and no range. How dare anyone compare her to Joni Mitchell?!?!? I think saying she is a poor man's Norah Jones would be generous.
2,32 flavors...,"Alana definitely has some talent, but the fact that she goes and covers an Ani DiFranco song fundamentally without RBR's permission, and then turns it into a teeny bopper hit is a bit argh, shall we say angering. She totally missed the point of the song. save your money and buy Ani's Not a Pretty Girl instead."
3,Not Ashkenazy's forte (pun on forte intended),"On the whole, Ashkenazy just does not seem to be a gifted interpreter of Schumann. These readings, to my ear, are heavy handed, pedantic, burdensome, and lacking in the mysterious joy that pervades so much of the work of the Romantic master. Some performances are OK. The Sinfonische Etuden would probably the best of the lot. But in works like Carnaval, the Novelletten, Faschingschwank aus Wien, and the Kinderszenen Ashkenazy to my liking totally misses the target.I much prefer the more introspective approach of Arrau, or the wild and intriguing Pollini. Even Barenboim comes closer to the heart of Schumann than Ashkenazy.The recorded sound is often disappointing also. The sound on some pieces is so muddy I thought the microphone was behind a wall."
5,Does the job,"This is a large cutting board that fits nicely onto a twin bed. I am using the board to cut out patterns and fabric for dressmaking and find cutting on the bed infinitely preferable to cutting out on the floor or on the dining room table. There are some curves included on the lined graph area, which I have used successfully to make a curved waistband.My cat likes to sit on the board and hasn't managed to damage it by clawing at it; a good indicator of durability.Overall, good value for money, even if it is only cardboard."
2,Did not receive cardboard model.,"The cutting boards I received were not these older, large model boards which I thought they would be. I had not been able to find them anyway and so ordered this item. What arrived was the smaller, repairable model which my family liked, but I had prefereed the cardboard ones.The rating is low because item received was fine, but not the item I had ordered."
3,"Insightful, Less Than Delightful","Dense. Deep. That Poirier knows his stuff. He knows it cold, and he's been doing a lot of thinking about American authors, too. He's got some fine ideas about them. And a mighty big vocabulary he uses in expressing those ideas. What he hasn't got is any way into his thinking for people who don't know as much as he does. He doesn't talk down to this uninitiated reader; he simply ignores him/her. I confess I could only get about halfway through his latest, and I'm the kind of reader who doesn't quit lightly. So while I found some good stuff in here -- his writings on Whitman especially -- I got tired of having to reread everything twice. Maybe you'll have more patience."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but not very useful","An attempt was made to pack a lot of information into this slender book. There are numerous sightings or locations listed, but only extremely brief details about each (usually a couple of sentences).There are some statements that make me think the author wasn't too critical or thoughtful in screening the information listed--In one case, witnesses are quoted as hearing the whistle of a sailing ship blow. Don't count on being able to locate specific places, even for listings such as stone circles. Very little information or specifics are provided in most cases.As the previous reviewer stated, Mexico is ignored. The rich heritage of ""mysteriousness"" in Hawaii is also ignored, though this is more geographically justifiable. The book has numerous illustrations and photographs, but they are not of very good quality.If you are considering purchase of this book, I'd suggest considering Salvatore M. Trento's regional guides instead."
3,I expected more,"I really expected more. This book was interesting, but it just didn't give enough to be called an atlas."
3,Enjoyable but not exceptional stories,"This collection of 4 short stories is a pleasant read but not exceptional. Virginia Lanier's story is the strongest and the others are good but lack ""heft""."
2,Half time,"With four experienced writers contributing stories to this book, I expected better. The first two stories are readable, the last two are a waste of time. Sometimes combining authors is not a 'good thing'."
1,Do not buy this cd!,"this cd must have been made when they were singing in the garage or the street corner. it is way off key, just horrible!"
3,"Many 90s club 12"" versions...","Some 7""s but a good number of extended versions on this compilation (there's never been a volume two as far as I know). Only disappointment for me was the EDIT of the 12"" version of Stinkin Thinkin. Too bad they didn't just remove some of the 7"" versions and give us longer versions of less tracks. Track times:What Is Love (Extended Club Remix) (5:37Angel (Temple Dub - Mousse T's Mix) (5:34My Peace Of Heaven (International Mix) (9:09)Your Loving Arms (T&T; Freeze Mix) (7:12)Everytime You Touch Me (Na Feel Mix) (5:06)The Rhythm Of The Night (4:10)Power Of Love (Zanzibar Vocal Mix) (5:17)Hippychick (3:15)Fascinated (3:51)Stinkin Thinkin (Junior Style Mix) (6:02)Luv Connection (Maurice's Studio 53 Mix) (7:26)Dub Be Good To Me (Norman Cook's Excursion On The Version) (4:44)Power To Move Ya (Smoove Power) (6:09)"
1,short range area.,I swapped an antenna original D-Link and by the gain was very small. Not worth it.
5,BUY THIS NOW,"i know many people learn about them from their opening song in fullmetal alchemist that played on cartoon network.Ajikan is so much more than that. a great band with a fantastic following. i can't say enough about this band, but i wanted to stop by and give it 5 stars.in japan, this cd sells for $25-$30. in america, it's half that or less. it's the best bargain you'll ever find.their new album, fanclub, is even better. but, it's not out in the USA, you have to cough up the $27.50 for it. also a newer compilation of their singles and bsides is coming out in a few weeks, 10.25.06.enjoy! kore wa hontou ni sugoi ongaku desu!"
5,Sol-Fa,Gave this to my son for Christmas and he really enjoys it. He would recommend the CD to anyone that likes Jpop.
4,Thank Goodness...,Sooo much better than the text I tried first (Idiot's Guide to Access). The entire book is much more simplified. TRULY a beginner's guide.
4,john woo fun,"I bought this item for a friend. It was pretty exciting introducing someone to John Woo, especially because they usually aren't fond of action thrillers. It's been a pleasure."
5,Superb Family Entertainment Stressing Solid Family Values.,"This is a first rate movie with a totally professional cast, script, and everything else that goes into a movie. The story centers around a sixth grader, Alice, and her family, dealing with a whole panoply of life's problems ranging from the serious(dealing with the loss of Alice's mother) to the light-hearted(dealing with the embarrassment of falling down on stage). All of these issues somehow hold together in the story to form a unified concept, revealing many of life's lessons. I was very impressed by the way this movie held my interest and kept an upbeat mood. The DVD also includes behind the scenes interviews with the two main child leads, and the costume designer. The whole family should enjoy this."
3,"Good movie for tweens, but nothing very new or different.","This is a sweet movie about Alice (Alyson Stoner) who moves to a new town and must make friends in a new middle school. Although Alice wants to be one of the cool girls in school her day dreams only land her in one embarrassing situation after another.However, Alice learns during the course of the movie that appearances aren't everything and she finally begins to accept herself for who she is. She also helps her father (Luke Perry)to accept the loss of her mother and move along with his life.I thought the movie was good and the actors played their parts well and would have given it 4 stars but my 9 year old, the prime target audience for this movie, asked me to dock another star for an oft repeated theme in tween movies. She said that although the story was ""cute"" it was ""too typical and predictable."" Hence my current 3 star rating."
2,It's okay,"I thought the father was miscast and the editing could have been tighter to produce a shorter film. The rest of the cast seemed well selected and it was a pleasant surprise to see Penny Marshall acting again. The storyline seemed more like a made for TV show sit-com. I think the premise of adjusting to a mother's death and then adjusting to a new school district was worthy, but there was no real depth given to any area. If I were a pre-adolescent then perhaps I would have enjoyed it more."
3,A Nice Movie That Can Teach Children Some Lessons,"A nice DVD for tweens that can teach them some lessons for life. Alice struggles with real life issues with the death of her Mother, and her Dad moving the family to another town and away from her friends. The acting is good and the plot can hold the viewer's interest. Worth watching."
4,Good 'growing pains' story,"This is a good drama/comedy about the pain of growing up. Geared at 6th graders, it shows the emotional tribulations of Alice, the new girl at school. Alice's mother died when she was five, so she has no real role models other than her aunt and struggling father. When the family has to move, she feels even more out of place. Clinging to the hope that she'll be able to learn from a 'cool' teacher at school, Alice learns that sometimes the best role models are the last people you'd think of. Penny Marshall is fantastic as the tough teacher, Mrs. Plotkins. Though a talented director, I also love seeing her in acting roles. I did feel a little old when I saw Luke Perry play a 'dad' (hasn't been that long since he was playing teens, has it?). Oh well...time marches on. This movie is perfect for my young niece who is at that 'awkward' age too. I know she'll love it as much as I did. Very well done.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Outstanding Strauss set,"Strauss fans who have been subsisting on classic recordings by Karajan, Kempe and Reiner will find this collection a refreshing alternative. The Mehta recordings are some of the best he ever made, but there is also an excellent Aus Italien from Ashkenazy, a red-blooded Death and Transfiguration from Dohnanyi, and a suite put together by Dorati from Der Rosenkavalier that puts Kempe to shame. Altogether, this is a wonderful set and a great bargain."
3,Works for me (so far),"This monitor has been fine for me so far. It does 1024 x 768 at 85Hz (optimal for a 17-inch monitor); has good color, clarity and sharpness; and of course the flat screen. Having owned it only a short time I can't say about long-term reliability. I have had no problems. Recommended for the bargain range, unless you know of any reason against it."
4,Decent monitor.,"I have had this monitor for few years now. The color is still crisp and clear.However, recently the vga cable has started giving out. CRT monitor is still good but cable needs repair. I have to position the cable just right for clear crisp image, otherwise it turns yellowish. That is my only problem with this model."
5,"Not just about the test but also teaching methods, laws etc.","If you are serious about becoming a great teacher, then you should read this book. It is not just a study prep but a great book on pedagogy, laws related to teaching, testing theories, development theories, discipline techniques....and so much more.I just finished a Master's degree in Education and I'm still learning so much from this book. It has complete and in-depth chapters on each of the 13 competencies and also a final chapter on test taking skills for the 4-8, 8-12 PPR test.This is the kind of reference you can use even after you pass the test!"
4,excellent,"It's an excelent purchase as no damage, this book look like brand new.after purchasing this book came in time,I will defenately buy again with the same co."
4,The flagship of a lengthy saga...,"""Diadem from the Stars"" kicks off Clayton's mammoth nine-book (with a follow-up trilogy which picks up where the original series, or what's left of it, leaves off) Diadem series. This book, which (to be quite honest) is mainly exposition, introduces us to the herione of the saga, Aleytys, who was orphaned by her spacefaring mother on a barbarian world. The book concerns her discovering her past and her powers, and her escape from the tribe who fears and resents her. In the course of her travels to find a way offworld to her home planet, she comes across the diadem, an alien artefact which, when she dons it, implants itself permamently into her skull and endows her with mysterious and fearful powers. The story unfolds in a manner similar to Tanith Lee's classic ""The Birthgrave"", but not as moody and bombastic. I quite enjoyed Clayton's writing style, and look forward to reading more of her work."
2,tedious,"First things first - I'm not a big fan of the genre. Not sure how this book compares to others, but I found it really tedious. Long passages of very detailed descriptions made it move very slowly. Don't get me wrong - nothing wrong with details, but here, describing color, shapes and textures of made-up landscapes, plants and animals did not add any value. And they are everywhere. The author seems not to be able to pass any opportunity. The first hundred pages could easily be done in 10 or 15. If you like to know what color tunics everybody is wearing, what is the shape of every leaf on the planet, and how is everyone feeling at the moment - go ahead, knock yourself out. I'm off to another planet."
2,disapointing after Skeen,"There was too much sex. Having said that, there were passages that took too long. In addition, with the Diadem she becomes too powerfull. All in all it was a burden to finish."
4,"Gritty, yet Smooth and Sweet","This book, (though originally thought to be nothing more than a mere hood tale with no enlightening aspects whatsoever), was actually damn good. the sequel could hold a torch to it also. this novel left me speechless afterwords... it's simply hot, innovative, sexy, cunning, and ridiculously enlightening. keep 'um comin' kashamba. "" you're definitely here to stay""."
1,Straight Garbage,"This book was garbage. When will people learn there is a difference between a good story and a good book? The editing was horrible, and I'm not even talking about the typos because I expect that from Triple Crown. The dialogue was a disgrace and its real funny how this book was written in first person but Mona was able to tell what other people were saying when she wasn't even around. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare or nothing, but could the author at least show she passed 10th grade English class?"
1,"I'm sorry, is it just me...","I wasn't feeling this book. How is it that other reviewers gave this book 4 and 5 stars? I don't get it. While reading it I was like what is all the hype about?? The only part that held my attention was the ending. I was disappointed and as a result, I am not in that much of a hurry to read Grimey. I hope the story gets better but on the real, Noire's ""Thong on Fire"" was such a better read than this novel ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MORAL MESSAGE TO TAKE HOME AFTER YOUR READ. I was not satisfied with this read. It was difficult trying to finish it, I wasn't attached to the characters at all. Maybe Williams' books Grimey and Driven will be better reads...i have them both, so we shall see."
3,So So,"First time reading a book by this author I say it was a so so book.Book mainly was about this girl Mona that wanted to finsh school and go run up behind a rapper name Controversy but, instand she ends up with Cam one of the guys that hangs out with COntroversy. Mona likes the lifestyle that Cam giving her so she ends up moving to New York and leaving Delware her mom that is a crack head her grandma and her brother that is a hothead out selling drugs. But, Mona thinks she has it all until she starts finding out the other part of Cam though Cam's baby mama Nikki that happens to pop up.Cam has a lot of demons in his close and Mona finds out but, still stays around while he treats her like crap. Mona starts sleeping with Cam friend Prince since she wasn't getting any from Cam but, Mona was still stuck on getting with Controversy and which she did and that lead her trying to run back home to Delware to her family.Book was so so."
3,Common Reader,"I give the book 3 stars. The book started off very slow and just like any other hood legend that you have read before. You know, the ""IT"" girl who looks so good that drug dealers just throw her all their money just for sex and then take her out of the hood and give her a good life, only for her to find out that the drug dealer is a killer and crazy. Same ol, same ol. However the middle of the book starts to speed up and take a different turn and the book only gets better from there. I loved the middle and end but hated the intro. so I gave it the three stars, but if you can make it past the beginning then it's worth the read."
2,You've got to be kidding me!,"According to the reviews on this book, I assumed that it was gonna be a good read. How unsatisfiying! I can not believe that people would actually give this book 4 1/2 stars. Paaelease! People dont waste your money."
3,Pretty good,"I read this book in one day on a bus. It was pretty good, there a few typos. But the storyline is firm and good. The book was a bit too predictable for me, but I still enjoyed it. Basically about your smalltown girl who wants to get out and live the big life with a big man, and all that mess that happens in between."
5,GIFTED WRITER!,I read this book in 2 days... it's a page turner from cover to cover. I would also recommend that every teenage read this novel. It was also enlightening for those of us who are not teens. This novel has strong content and a strong message for every reader to know....WONDERFUL presentation Ms. Williams. When can we expect your next novel?????
4,Very Enlightning!,"All women who think that depending on men to pay their way to the glamorous life is a good thing need to read this book. There's a good message here. Mona learned the hard way. She was raised by a triffling mother so she really didn't have a decent roll model to rely on. The result is tragic. She suffered at the hand of a psychotic human being who cared for no one, not even his family. If there was no pleasure in it for him, what was the purpose. Mona was a smart and gifted young lady who could have made something good out of her life if only she had a decent role model to rely upon growing up. Hopefully people who read this book who have children and aren't doing what they're supposed to will wake up and realize what road lies ahead for children. We don't want another Camron or another Mona to exist."
4,A Nice Read,"I read this book in two four days, it was a very good read. I would read any books that the author writes."
5,"""OFF THE HOOK""","BLINDED COULN'T GET ANY BETTER.THIS BOOK WAS OFF THE HOOK.IT IS ABOUT YOUNG MONA WHO LOOKS FOR ALL THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE...BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW SHE COULD PUT HER SELF IN SUCH DANGER .THIS BOOK IS VERY SAD BECAUSE MONA DIDN'T KNOW THE LIFE SHE WAS LEADING HER SELF INTO.IN HTS BOOK BLINDED MONA MEETS A DUDE NAMED CAMRON WHO HAPPENS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS MAN,WHO WILL KILL HIS FAMILY MAMBER IN THE BLINK OF THE EYE.WHAT MADE MONA DIFFERENT?

3,Limited in scope,"A good book if you want photos of nature from a few places in Maine. Most of the photos are from the mid-coast area, with a few more inland. The cover photo is the best in the book. I wish books like this had a map with the photo locations pinpointed; most of the places are unfamilar to me and so I had to look up on-line where they are located. The essays are just average; the one of the winter is hard to read."
4,Great photography,"Was in Maine in September, 2010. The photography in this book captures the beautiful, varied landscapes of the most beautiful New England state.....great fall foliage pics and rugged coast lines."
4,Guerillas of Grace,"Great creative prayers. I feel his (the author's) grreat spirit in the words of his prayers that are graced with the Spirit. I am a Chaplain and have used this book with my patients, families, in educational opportunities as well as my personal meditation time. At my bedside at all times."
1,Not a complete waste of money.....,"If you're looking for an authoratative service manual on your MKI MR2, this is not it. It is better then the Cliton's Corolla/MR2 manual though. The Haynes manual covers only 85-87 MKI's and really concentrates in the 85-86. Anything past the most simple reffers you to a technician.If your looking a manual that covers your car completely, you'll need to contact Toyota Publishing and purchase a real Service Manual. They are much more expensive, but well worth it."
5,Great addition to the big green book,"This is a great manual for one of the greatest cars! Haynes and the BGB make the perfect couple. This manual has a lot of detailed photos and diagrams, and will walk you through even the most daunting jobs. Must have."
5,A Fabulous Treasure of Disney!,"This book summarizes Walt Disney's career in a very enjoyable manner, including many ""souvenirs"" from his life. These in themselves are history - a menu showing prices at that time, a letter written by him - these reflect the depth of the research and also the quality of the publication itself. Althnough I purchased this book for a girl aged 15 who asked specifically for it, I would have purchased it just for me. It truly is a collector's item. And, what made it even nicer was the price offered on Amazon - much lower than other book vendors. I would recommend this book highly not only to Disney fans but to history buffs as well."
3,Several problems with Windows XP,"There are some issues with this Belkin bluetooth adapter and wanted to warn potential buyers. I purchased this adapter a a local retailer despite warnings from other reviewers here.Mac OS 10.3.5 - Works perfectly as every other bluetooth adapter I've tried.Windows XP SP1a, SP2 - Works right after installing the WIDCOMM bluetooth drivers. Stops working after the first restart. Continue to get ""invalid license key"" ""shutting down bluestackserver""--or something similar.The inconclusive problem is that while it works, it detects other bluetooth devices fine on my HP work computer. However, on my computer (with Asus P4C800-E motherboard) it fails to detect a Nokia N-Gage QD several feet away while a Nokia 6620 was detected. Using the bluetooth drivers in Windows XP SP2 fixes the problem detecting the N-Gage QD, so it appears the problem surrounds the WIDCOMM 1.4.2.10 drivers on the CD--the latest by the way."
3,"it works, it's just a little clunky","i picked this up for the same reason several other readers did: i wanted to be able to move pictures, sound, and my phonebook from my phone to my laptop and back. i use a thinkpad x31 using windows xp for this task.use the supplid drivers from the cd, they're much better than anything windows will attempt to do. and it will just work, unlike what windows may create.browsing with the supplied belkin software is clunky and ackward, not nearly as fluid as it could be. it's most definitely not as smooth as it is under Mac OS X, but hey, that's what you get. it works, i get to move pictures around on my phone and my contact list without a cable. but it's prone to fits of delays and ackwardness.i'm wishing there was better integration with windows xp right now, xp sp2 supposedly has smoother bluetooth software and browsing. i wish the belkin sofware worked as nicely. as it stands, this isn't the convenient device i hoped it would be, but i'll keep using it."
2,There is a much better alternative.,"I should have read all of these bad reviews before I bought the Belkin Adapter. I had the same problems with XP installation. Then I went and bought a TREDNET bluetooth adapterCompact Bluetooth USB CLASS2 Adapter Win Range 32.8FT 2.4GHZ. Installation went without a glitch. In less than 10 minutes I had installed the adapter, paired it with my Palm TX and was successfully syncing my Palm. I highly recommend this alternative."
5,Which one is this?,"There are two versions of this adapter:F8T001_v1F8T001_v2The picture in this page shows version 2, but oi does not state what version is this. The PDF manual for download correspond to a different adapter (CF card)Amazon could you be more specific?"
2,Toothless Bluetooth,I have a Dell Axim x30 and hoped to communicate with by Dell windows xp desktop through this device. After many hours of trying the only service that works is the file transfer. Bluetooth through this USB adapter is not ready for primetime.
3,didn't pair with Nokia 3650,"Though Nokia's tech told me Belkin's bluetooth adapter worked with their phone, when I bought it and tried it, I could move photos and media back and forth between phone and PC, but could not get an official ""pair"" and thus Nokia's PC Suite would not open and mrouter would not show connection. I like the device because it is small, cute, and works with USB, but my Nokia is the only bluetooth device I have, so I will return it. I am trying Socket's Bluetooth PC Card and it also is not working for my Nokia 3650. Wondering if Nokia phone has a big problem."
1,"100 inches, not 100 meters","Don't waste your time or money. I can't belive this adapter is rated to 100 meters. I tried 2 different units, and neither worked beyond 10-15 feet. I do have a wirless mouse, but I swapped it out for a wired one with no difference, so interference wasn't the problem.In addition, the setup is a pain. Not really Belkin's fault, but XP home ""hijacks"" the installation process and installs Microsoft drivers without giving you the chance to install the Belkin driver.You may or may not get ""invalid license"" errors, in which case you have to uninstall and reinstall.Finally, I got a consistent ""network cable disconnected"" error icon in my systray. Please explain where this disconnected ""cable"" is in a Bluetooth network."
4,Indispensable,"Arrived next day even though used supersaver shipping !! It's the F8T001 (100m range) just as I'd hoped (wasn't sure but ordered anyway). Computer recognized it right away. Synchronizing is a breeze with iSync and a mac; merged my T68i contacts with address book in seconds. What's more, I can now control my computer from anywhere in my apartment with my T68i phone thanks to the ""clicker"" software. Can control iTunes (tracks and volume) and DVD player (so I can watch movies in bed) - absolutely fanstastic!! Inseperable part of my mac now..... (minus one star because it's a little bulkier than other adapters especially with adjustable antenna; covers adjacent USB port on my iBook but ok for keyboard of my power mac - guess that's the price for a 100m range)."
1,Belkin F8T001 has XP SP2 Root Canal,"I purchased the Belkin Bluetooth F8T001 USB Adapter so that I could synch my IPAQ 1945 PDA. However, after software installation, I could only get ""BTTray: Incorrect License type"" and ""Error - Unable to start Stack Service.""When I contacted Belkin Tech Support, I was told that the problem was caused by the Microsoft Service Pack 2. According to Belkin, Microsoft has included their own version of Bluetooth in SP2, and it is not compatible with the Belkin adapter. When I asked for their suggestions, they replied that I should ""uninstall SP2."" They told me that SP1 ""works with some devices,"" and XP works with everything. I asked when they were going to update their drivers to work with this adapter, and they said that they didn't know. ""Microsoft had not yet published their interfaces."" My feeling was that as far as the company Tech Support was concerned, the device works OK with XP original, so any problems I am having are just my tuogh luck."
3,Belkin Bluetooth USB Adapter,"Without a picture I can't be sure we are all talking about the same thing. I have a Belkin USB Bluetooth Adapter (Model #F8T001). I've used the adapter on both my laptop and PC with good results. The laptop went much more smoothly because I ran the installation CD first before inserting the USB. If you plug and play, Windows recongnizes something, but cannot find the drivers easily. The 100m range seems optimistic, but I have been able to access my Sony Ericsson t68i phone while it is sitting in my bag, in the corner of the office."
2,Tricky setup with XP & SP2,"Expect many issues when installing the Belkin software onto a Win XP, service pack 2 OS. The Microsoft enumerator wants to take over and will continue to haunt you unless it is disabled and stopped in admin-tools/services. Expect many reboots. Belkin has come out with a revised version 2 with a different set of problems, just as many reboots. Be ready to call Belkin tech support. Works great once it is installed."
1,Win XP BSOD- WOW,"I haven't seen the BSOD (blue screen of death) in a while! How exciting! Never seemed to want to work with XP (even though it is supposed to be compatible)which kept telling me a local connection was unplugged. Once I tried to actually make a connection from a device, my pc would crash every few minutes. My PC experience goes back to 286's so I'm not a total doof, but, this is bad news. Maybe a newer version of the adapter will work, but only if you've got the courage to risk it."
3,Headcovers for Golf Irons,"Relatively easy on/off design. Have played 5 rounds with them so far, and haven't lost any of them yet---which does say something. Nice design. Quality good to above average. Priced right. I like them so far!"
5,Grover at his best!,"There's quite a few Grover Washington CDs around, but what makes this one unique is the live aspect. As I listened to the tracks, I could feel the energy of the audience. A big highlight of this release is the 20 minute version of Days of our lives/Mr. Magic. After listening to that I felt that this would have been worth the price of the CD, but there was more! This entire CD is worth listening to. Buy it and you won't be disappointed."
5,amazing once again by grover,"this grover title is one of my favorites,with such greats as dr.gibbs the precussion rythmic beat is outstanding.the best track is the hot sausilito wih the soulful sounds of grover.a must buy as this is a resent re-release on cd."
2,College text,"I had purchased this book expecting it to be in ""very good"" condition as noted by the seller. Unfortunately, it is in fair condition, at best. I was very disappointed. The extensive highlighting and underlining make it difficult to use."
2,Needs More Technical Reviewing,"This book is very problematic in the fact that, despite the author's claim of ""three or four technical reviewers"", there are coding problems which could have been easily caught by testing the code.For example code given on pages 89-90 for a script generate errors abut undefined variables and . I double checked my code against the book and found no differences. I downloaded the source code from the author's web page and used that and received the same errors.The author's website also makes it clear that she is somwhat unreceptive to these errors being pointed out when I went to the site advertised for her to see if there were any corrections and such. She does not even provide a means to contact her and from the tone of her ""Contact Information"" page, she does not take to kindly to being called on the carpet.This book is definitely a work in progress and should not be purchased by anyone wanting to actually learn PHP."
4,Thumbs up for this book!,"Using this book and a few choice websites, I was able to create my very own PHP/MySQL driven website for users to sell books.I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to learn PHP that have *some* programming experience"
2,"Good looks, poor holding power","I had been searching for a magnetic tool holder for screwdrivers and pliers, and ran across several that looked to work good, but didn't look good. I found this one, which is made out of wood and looks very nice. Unfortunately the holding power pales in comparison to others. When reaching for one tool, a small accidental touch of another tool causes a domino of falling tools. My dad had a similar product in his garage, and they were extremely powerful magnets. I have not been able to find them, as they were purchased several years ago. Oh well"
5,"Up & Down, I think UP","This song is the type of song that you can dance at in a club, play in your stereo, listen to in the car, or ANYWHERE! Billy Lawrence is my favorite singer in the world, her voice and lyrics are so catchy and so beautiful. If you get this, you gotta pick up the albums."
2,CHEAPLY MADE,"This kit is CHEAPLY MADE. only ONE of the 5 wires had connectors that were crimped properly. 2 of them pulled right off with barely any force and we had to recrimp them. The contacts and rubber covers are cheap too.The only good part about it seems to be the wire itself, which Im sure, they dont make themselves.They do seem to work okay, but it is probably cheaper to go buy good wire, and make your own. Thats what it looks like these guys did."
1,Cheap piece-save your money and time,I got this as a gift and it arrived damaged. Asked to be sent replacement pieces and they did and they too were broken even worse than the first shipment.Ended up having to take apart and return heavy item to store. Huge pain!
2,"Pretty piece, if it assembled better","Bought this piece at a Target Store...4 pieces were broken in the box. Called the 800 number listed in the directions and new pieces were shipped. Put the last 2 large drawers together and they did not fit in the shelf unit. The shelf unit did not go together very well and was not quite square; which could be part of the problem of the drawers not going in. My husband took drawers apart and tried again...they are in, but are hard to pull out and put back. I love the piece, but think that the company needs to package their products better and make sure that screw holes line up so that pieces go together right."
1,poor quality control and service,"After opening the box and taking all the pieces out, I can't even start to put it together because there are pieces missing. (Obviously, the quality control paper verifying that all the pieces were checked is worthless.) I called the number on the instruction page, and they will ship the pieces in 7-10 business days, which is much longer than other companies I have dealt with. Now, I have an open box with different pieces everywhere, and won't get this resolved for 1-2 weeks. Based on other reviews, it sounds like this is a common problem. Cute chest, but expensive for the quality, and not worth the added hassle. I will probably try to fit all the pieces back in the box and return it."
2,Buying from the internet? Read This!!!,My roommate bought the 5-Drawer Chest from a target store and together we easily put it together. I loved it so much that I went out and bought 1 for myself. The problem was I bought mine on the internet!! When the company ships out the Chest they don't pack it correctly. I have so far received 2 Chests and every single drawer front has been broken in half. I had to have my mother go to the store and buy it so that she could ship it to me in a safe way.
5,Great dresser! Looks great in our room,"I searched and searched for the perfect dresser for our tiny bedroom. This was exactly what I was looking for. It isn't as big as most dressers but my husband stores most of his folding clothes in it comfortably (wouldn't work if he didn't have his own closet to hang shirts and dress pants though). I also love the bench and am looking forward to treating myself to it after the holidays or when it goes on sale again. I bought mine at the store and unless you don't have a Target close to you, I'd advise that you do the same."
4,Great style,This piece was a gift. I really loved the style. Drawers went together with ease. However one side of the piece was not drilled correctly. I was most impressed when I called Target 1-800 number and was quickly connected and told shipment of new piece will be on their way in 3 to 4 days. When this piece is complete I intend to go to Target to purchase additional pieces.
1,I am SO disappointed,"I saw this item in the store and decided to purchase it for extra storage space in my bedroom. Much to my dismay, when my husband was finished assembling it after two hours, we discovered that the bottom drawer didn't fit into the frame. I was irritated, but still liked the look of the item for the price. So, I returned the item to the Target store, and exchanged it for another. Believe it or not, once the new piece was put together, NONE of the drawers fit into the assembled structure! The sides of the structure were too narrow! This is so ridiculous! Not only do I have the frustration of the drawers not fitting, but now I have to get back into my car AGAIN and return the bulky thing. Whoever Target is contracting to make their Pier One style furniture needs to be fired! I don't typically purchase furniture from stores such as Target. This was definitely the LAST time!"
5,Very Pleased.......,"I just got this delivered a few days ago and it looks great. Not one thing came damaged in the box, i was worried about ordering from online because of previous reviews. It looks great and it fit all of the clothes i had in the old dresser plus some. I liked it so much that i went online to buy another one, but they were all out ;(. But i guess they restocked, so i am getting another one. Its a good deal for the money and it looks great in the room!!!!!!"
4,Beautiful 5 Drawer Chest!,"I really like this 5-drawer chest, it looks beautiful once assembled and offers alot of storage. My only reason for not giving it a full five stars is it can be a bit difficult to assemble, the pieces can be a bit off (as in drill holes not quite in the right place, especially the drawers) but it all came together somehow and after many hours of assembly, I just love it. It is excellent for a small space, and even though I swore I would never put another one of these together, I like it so much I am considering adding more pieces at these great prices! Too bad Target doesn't offer a delivery and assembly service."
1,it is great but...,I loved the way it looks except for one thing. I put every thing together but the last drawer and the panel was drilled wrong. It has been three months and still no replacement part. I have incomplete furniture and they say they aren't making the parts any more. SO be careful with what you purchase.
3,Not Bad,It was easy to assemble. At first I had problems with the drawers sticking or not closing completely. The problems were solved by pulling out the drawers and giving them taps with my hand until the pieces came into line. The drawers work fine now. The drawer chest does seem a bit unstable since its height is a bit much relative to its base. It does provide a lot of storage space.
2,"Looks great, but......","I purchased this piece a few months ago to use for lingerie. It feels very unstable and the drawers get jammed often (don't shut completely). However, maybe it's sturdier than it seems because it made it through a move, but I hate that it's wobbles so easily. The good thing is that it looks great. The dark, rich color of the wood looks great with a natural/island/exotic type decor. If you're using it to store clothing, be sure to wipe out the sawdust first."
1,Shoddy construction,"I am an avid Target shopper and have purchased several pieces of furniture that I have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, this is not one of those times!! I was a little wary of buying the chest after seeing several reviews about broken pieces being recieved upon shipment. Well, I was certainly not an exception - our chest arrived with several chip marks on the face of the drawers and one of the faces of the drawers had completely fallen off and had to be reglued. The construction is shoddy and some of the drawers do not fit properly. In my opinion, Target should remove this product line from it's inventory! It is not up to par with what they normally carry. In a nutshell, I am highly dissappointed with the chest."
1,Island Collection 5 -Drawer Chest,"I bought the Island Collecion 5-Drawer Chest. The varnish was good in some places and non in others. Screw holes would not line up. Bottom of the drawers were like paper. Will not hold up. Pieces were laying in bottom of box that were suppose to be glued on. A total mess that we had to hire someone to bring to the dump. Not worth the effort to pack up, haul to UPS and ship back when people are sick. Don't buy this piece of garbage. I will never buy anything from this company that sells inferior products again.Norma Debien from N.Y."
4,"Overall good, especially for the price","The look is quite attractive and it fits into small places well, but the sides do look a bit cheap and it's not 100% solid. After a year of use, my guess is that it will become a bit wobbly. Still, it meets my needs."
5,Ben Ainslie's Laser Campaign Manual,"There is a CD included which is not mentioned by the advert. This shows Ben demonstrating 9 disciplines, such as starting and running downwind, with his voice narrating. This makes the techniques come to life and a lot easier to follow.You can't really argue with the advice of the Olympic Gold Medallist - this book has already taken precious seconds off my times! No Laser Sailor can afford to be without this book!!!"
5,The only Laser XD manual you'll ever need,"Forget those books with lots of theories, Ben Ainslie, an Olympic Gold-Medalist, has gifted the XD sailing community with this book. Although it may look simple, all his tricks really works at sea, and there are complex reasons for being so if you are keen enough to consult books on aerodynamics or fluid mechanics just to check him out (I studied Aerospace Engineering in College). If you are serious in the sport, just playback the inclusive VCD for a thousand time, and of course, practice his posture, you will never be disappointed."
4,Practical book for anyone racing small sail boats.,"Lots of good info from an expert sailor. Must read for anyone who sails small boats, not just Lasers."
2,not worth it,I ordered a hairball control product for my cats. It arrived on time but the product expires in just 4 months. Totally not worth the money.
2,Galbraith's ideas are old - he touts Japan's economy - ha!,"Economists like Galbraith are laughable. Their economic ideas are nothing more than fads, unlike Adam Smith's classical economic philosophy - a model that seems to gain more credence as the years pass, not less. Near the end of the book Galbraith touts Japan's economy as one the U.S. should more closely emulate. I doubt he would write so foolishly had he penned this book more recently. As a history of economic thought, this book was merely adequate."
2,Black and White pictures?,"Quite a disappointment. Most of the pictures are in black and white, you can hardly see any detail. I really like looking at finished glassbeads and sculptures. But this gives me no inspiration at all."
2,It's Just OKAY!,"To the naive public this book is great! Riddled with typos and inconsistant captions this book is not ideal for understanding formal flameworking. The book includes information about the masters and their techniques but trivializes their skill by including no-names and wanna-be's along side. A good amount of important technical information is provided, but through a string of often choppy inconsistant paragraph fragments. This is an excellent PICTURE BOOK leaving a lot to be desired from the academic artisan. Is a great reference for suppliers. In many cases the information falls short of being cohesive and understandable. Recommended for the glass-goer. Recommended for the amateur glassblower (for inspiration). Has popular appeal void of substance."
2,Fine thought..but it doesn't work,"Some things just doesn't mend.I'm talking about the strange mix of growl and clean and extremly light vocals...To me it just sounds goofy and it's pretty laughable..Strange contrasts is NOT the greatest way in creating music..the only extreme band that has managed to make something good with it is Opeth.But as my topic regards, the whole idea and content of this record is a fine effort, and therefore it can escape with two rating stars..."
3,Decent!,"This album is pretty good. I love the way the clean vocals sound -- the guy who does it (I'm not familiar with the band) is an EXCELLENT singer! In my opinion, they need more clean vocals and less growling -- it would make them sound SO much better.My favorite songs on this album are ""Beginning of the End"" and ""Three Dimensional Aperture"".. GREAT songs! The lyrics are included inside the album cover, which is always a plus!"
4,Decent,"This album would have easily been 5 stars if Into Eternity would have dropped the wannabe-death metal vocals (sounded closer to metalcore/hardcore screaming to me, which is obviously very lame.)Other than that, very good release."
1,Feet are a nusance!,"I do not like this iron. I am a quilter and use irons regularly, so I thought i would give this iron a try. I am very dissapointed. When setting the iron to the side, you have to make sure it's dead-center on the ironing board, otherwise, it will flip right off the board. The back foot was resting half-way on the board causing it to become unstable. But that is not the worst of it. The water tank capacity is good for about half a shirt (but perhaps that's because it leaked the entire time)! Even with the iron set to the hottest setting and the steam lever turned to off, it still dripped! Once I even came back to my ironing board and the entire reservoir had emptied onto my ironing board and floor!"
1,Would not recommend this to anyone,"I have tried and tried to like this iron. It spits and stains my quilting fabric. The only way I now use it is for dry ironing when I starch. I called the Manufacture and they only told me to turn the iron down, DUH, and to clean the iron. ( I had just received it).Also, I agree, it is very heavy."
1,Leaks water on clothes,"Lifting mechanism is clever and worked fine for us. However the leaking water and inconsistent steam was awful. If you move it quickly as you iron, water can splash out, and even if you go slow it will dribble. Sometimes it will start steaming uncontrollably regardless of what steam setting you are on. Way to take a nuisance chore, and make it awful."
1,LEAKY IRON,I bought this iron and I am so disappointed. The water just runs out of it. Like others I read reviews about this happening and I chose to ignore it and bought it anyway. Now I am going to have to buy a different iron. I wish I could contact the makers and complain to them big time about this problem. Water also leaks out of the Rowenta irons as well. I have had 2 of them and I wish I knew what kind to buy that actually works good and does not leak. Please be warned!! I wish I had paid more attention to the comments.
2,Iron with Legs,"As far as the legs go, two things were annoying.1: the noise of them going up and down every time you take your hand off/put it on. Nothing serious, just irritating after a while.2: you need to wait a second or two when you put your hand on it BEFORE sliding it across whatever you're ironing - otherwise the legs get caught in the item. Again nothing serious, just irritating.I was really getting used to it when it went on the fritz whilst in its resting position (ie with legs down) - the thermometer gave up and it burnt a hold in the ironing-board cover! Lucky I was around, or might have started a fire!!It is supposed to switch off when in resting position after a certain time and again when on it's heel.I have no idea why it died ... did not drop it or abuse it in any way. Shame quite liked it but am reluctant to buy another.Can't return it - live in Bermuda. Cost an arm and a leg to re-ship it and don't think warranties are valid outside of US!The downside of living in paradise : )"
1,This iron is a toy.,"I bought this iron for the unique lifting feature. Seemed like a good idea, but the performance is terrible. I can safely say this is one of the worst irons I have ever used! The reality, is that no matter how nifty the lifting feature is, the iron still NEEDS TO WORK! I'm packing this up and returning it."
1,Cheap poorly-made gadget,"This is one of those toys you buy and play with for about a day, take it out of the closet to show your friends, but isn't good for daily ironing. It's a pretty iron but it doesn't work. I bought one despite what some other folks thought about this iron, and now I regret it, I should have paid more careful attention to all the reviews! It is true about the leaking, dribbling out water, lifters knocking it off the ironing board, poor and inconsistant steam, cheap plastic construction, and non-gliding soleplate."
1,Save your time and money by NOT buying this iron,"I have nothing positive to say about this iron. It weighs a ton and, it steam is inconsistant, and the lifting feet pop out intermittently.The first iron I recieved was defective. I didn't heat up. I spent a lot of time going back and forth with this no-name manufacturer until they finally sent me another one. I received it yesterday, and this one leaks water all over the place! So have to return this defective iron too!I sincerely question the positve reviews on this site. They are all so glowing and nothing seems ever seems to be wrong with the iron. When there is really nothing to like about it. For example, how did the previous reviewer know there is a newer version coming out? That's suspicious! Where do this figure for cutting your ironing time in half??? It doesn't iron your clothes for you, and titling an iron on it's end isn't any slower than waiting for lifting feet to come out. I don't trust this company."
5,Overall good iron,I am a big fan of Real Simple magazine and have not gone wrong with products that they rate well in their product reviews. They gave the Oliso iron high marks in a recent review on irons so I decided to give it a try even though it was more than I wanted to pay. I have not been disappointed. The legs are a huge improvement over other irons and it's just an overall good iron that gets out the wrinkles.
1,Doesn't Work! I HATE this iron.,"After about 5 weeks of occasional use, the legs of the iron don't come out anymore! Isn't it convenient the company only has a 30-day return policy! Because that's about how long this iron lasts!!Don't waste your money on this iron!"
5,Well-made product,"Broke down and bought this iron when I read about it in Time Magazine. It's expensive, but worth it. The safety features of the legs are incredible (why didn't someone come up with this before?) and it's just a well-made product."
1,leaking water,Anytime there is water in the iron . it leaks all over your clothes . does not get very hot ..
2,Does not last !!!!,"I bought this iron about 10 months ago and paid $129.00 for it. I am a quiter and it was perfect for my needs. Loved the lifting mechanism and the amount of steam it put out. When I bought this iron, I expected a few years of use for the amount of money I spent on it. It died!!!! Stopped heating. Going out to buy a Rowenta."
5,Good quilting iron,I've used this iron for about one month and so far I am happy with it. I use it mostly for quilting and it seems to do a good job. I like the foot lifting feature and it get hot quickly.
4,Love the kick-stand!,"Very good iron. Water-well is very easy to fill, the ""kick-stand"" is absolutely wonderful, but I wish it would glide a bit more smoothly - perhaps they should put Teflon on the plate?"
1,Ironing is already bad enough...,"...and Oliso found a way to make it even worse!Honestly, what were they thinking when they came up with this one? !? ""Let's make a hot iron and knock itself off your ironing board and onto your feet!"" I think they've achieved that!WARNING: Unless you place this iron square and centered on your ironing board, it is likely to knock itself off your ironing board!"
1,Piece of JUNK,"I thought this was a cool gadget, and it's exactly that. Just a cheaply made gadget!The performance is very poor. It drags across the fabric. During normal use, it dribbles water out the front drain spout. Even worse, if you turn off the iron and leave it horizontal, it drips out of the soleplate! I have come back to my ironing board to discover it standing in a puddle of water!As if the above problems weren't enough to hate it, after about 20 uses, the raising mechanism completely stopped working. As far as how it irons, I prefer my $30 iron over this one! It performs a lot better and works reliably."
3,Not the quality I expected,"It is ""OK""...Not the quality I expected but I kept it and will use it...Putting, and keeping the grill plate on the unit is somewhat of a balancing act....The propane bottle is very hard to line up and screw into the unit from a flat surface...I moved the unit to the edge of the table so the bottle would ""hang over""...You can put the parts (legs etc.) inside the unit for storage, but it is somewhat of a puzzle to get them to fit...I think it is over priced....."
1,Terrible Grill,"The thing that attracted me to this one was the dishwasher safe rating. Yes it will go in the dishwasher, but it cooks unevenly, burns the outside of food while the inside is still uncooked. Worst of all I end up fighting with it just to get it turned on. It usually take me 2 minutes of fiddling with it to get it turned on. The knob is terrible. DON'T BUY IT!!"
4,Cookin outdoor,"It's nice portable grill which is easily stored anywhere, the grill does not cook well since it is a gas grill and heat is not distributed well, it's more like searing the meat than grilling it, it's good to use for small portions only, since it would take long to cook bigger portions of meat, the grill can easily be clean, the gas cylinder used can easily be installed, but lighting the grill takes time... Convenience and easy storage is great, cooking wise two or three stars only...."
3,Not used yet,"I had planned to use this product during the power outage resulting from Sandy. However I could't figure out the instructions about puting water in the bowl. That didn't make sense to me. I thought it would be great to heat water and soup, but I made do with my Fondue pot.I'm sure when I have time I'll figure it out."
2,Small portable grill,"The grill is a nice design, a bit on the small side. The electronic ignitor on it only worked one time and then became non functioning. We had taken it to the park to a cookout and had to ask other picnic goers to borrow a lighter in order to be able to cook. Needless, to say we were more than a little disappointed with the purchase and so returned it with no problems and received a full refund."
3,not bad--not realy good --worth it though,had some great steaks cooked on it but now the teflon coating comes off the rost. Used it for roughly 50 times and never maintained it well though.
4,convenient,i do alot of camping. i found this very useful and easy. i like it because it is compact. i bring alot stuff. I have mine for a couple years and don't regret the purchase.
4,Handy Dandy,"I bought this grill for my brother who travels about alot and camps usually out of the back of his truck.. He likes unusual things and this fit the bill. He did loose his brats once, they rolled off. Fortunately, he was at home in his drive way at the time!! He really likes this grill for it's packability and ease of use and clean up."
2,not bad as a portable stove,"I found the grill top to be a waste of time, too hot in the middle and too cold on the edges. As a stove top with a pot or a pan this can't be beat. It heats up easy and quick. Overall, not bad for camping or fishing, but it has limited uses."
1,not the best design,"Received this grill as a gift... the grilling surface is poorly designed and has a lot more surface area for the food to stick to. Add that to the uneven distribution of heat, and you won't be too pleased with your meal. It also lacks a lid that you can use while grilling; it does come with a plastic lid, but we've only used it to cover up the food still stuck to the grilling surface after packing it up after tailgating, etc. don't waste your money on this!"
2,Disappointing for Coleman,"Heading out on an extended camping trip and thought I'd upgrade from the cheep $20 grill. Wish I'd got the cheap $20 grill. The heat distribution is very poor, super hot spot in the center even on low. OK for quick grill items or used as a burner for boiling. Love the size and portability, and it cleans up quickly, but it is suppose to be about cooking. From now on I'll buy a Weber."
1,Don't buy this grill!,"This grill is no good. Sure it burns a nice flame, but it localizes it right in the center and worst of all, there is no lid so all of the heat remains in the middle and then escapes with the wind! You end up burning steaks because it doesn't retain the heat. What a waste of money. I tries it twice and then I trashed it and will locate one with a cover on it.It's probably good for hot dogs and thin hamburgers, or heating items in a pot."
3,"WANT TO GET RID OF IT, BUT I WON'T.","I got it for $30 at a garage sale 8 or 9 years ago, unopened. I burned the crap out of everything I cooked the first two times I used it. This little grill is a very hot cooker. Which means it is also a fast cooker. This is why I will not get rid of it. I go on camping trips where I and my friends don't want to spend a lot of time cooking. This grill is perfect for this, just don't walk away when you start cooking. I also take it on trips that I know that I will not be cooking anything more fancy than hotdogs, hamburgers, or brats. I run about half of my camping trips this way, for the other half I have a different grill set up.Only other thing that I don't like is that the aluminum legs have been stuck in the grill after the first time I used it, they will not come out. Packing it away can be a hassle, but I deal."
1,not portable,"I never did get to take my grill camping because, once we finally got the legs inserted into the (plastic) holes in the base, we could not remove them to be stored inside...The grill with legs inserted will not go into the bag. With legs permanently attached, it cannot be considered portable...might as well get a bigger grill."
2,Party Grill - Returned it.,"Purchased for $29 at big box store. I set it up and had concerns after reading the instructions. I then read reviews on it, and decided to return it. ""MADE IN CHINA"" sums it up. Not even a 25% discount makes a cheap product worth buying. Though I did NOT use it, I read several comments of users that made me think this was just not a reliable product. ""Ignitor failed after two uses"", ""sticky cook-top"", ""food burning in center"", ""legs impossible to remove"", I'd read enough.I will gladly pay 3 times as much for a grill that works as expected."
4,excellent 80's classic,"ahhhh. i remember this cd so well,,, i lost my flower for the first time to this album. excellent 80's pick up."
2,"disappointing, lacks depth, and slim in content","I really love Arrien's other books, particularly the book on the Tarot and the Four-Fold Way; they are both classics and show the brilliance of both her thinking and research. This book was a great disappointment and does not have the depth and thoughtfulness the author shared with readers in previous titles. I found the Muse theory rather flimsy and non-inspirational; there are some exercises to stimulate the reader to make collages and other activities, but the book lacks the inspirational qualities that would encourage the reader to pursue these exercises. The content is pretty slim and surprisingly, the quality of the paper and images included in the book are rather cheap and faded. That is not the author's fault, but Tarchers', but it does detract from the book and the readers' enjoyment.While I cannot recommend this book, I do recommend Arrien's other books if you have not read this author's work in the past."
2,Expected More.,I pre-ordered this book. When it arrived I was disappointed to find a hardcover workbook. I guess I expected more. Borrow this one from a friend.
2,Ho hum,"I love Ravensburger puzzles. I think they're the best quality puzzles I've ever seen. So when I saw this game by Ravensburger, I got all excited. My kids are major story tellers, too, so I thought it would be a big hit. Not so. There's so little you can do with it. The pictures just don't allow for much variety. The quality is great, just like I expected from Ravensburger. And I like the concept. But something's just missing to make it a fun game that the kids will want to play."
5,CAN'T PUT HIS BOOKS DOWN!,"Richard Parrish is a great writer who creates characters that are down to earth and interesting. For individuals like me who live in the geographical location that he writes about, (set in the early days of our community's history)his stories are a real treat. I have read several of his books; the protagonist, Joshua Rabb, is a lawyer for the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Land Management who must deal with the political problems of the day even when they coincide with his own moralistic beliefs. I would highly recommend VERSIONS OF THE TRUTH or any of Parrish's other novels. Once you start one, you will be hooked!"
4,Preparing for the PANRE,"Just took the PANRE yesterday. This study guide is helpful in broad strokes. Much better than the Appleton & Lange books. However, study questions, for the most part, aren't in depth enough. My PANRE questions were at a much ""deeper"" level than those in this book. This book and CD are a good place to start. I supplemented with Current Internal Med."
4,Lots of info in a little space,This was a great review for those of us who have been out in practice for a long while...still have to take the test but I'm feeling more prepared in those areas which are not a part of my daily responsibilities. I really like the post test disc which gives a rationale for the answers.
3,Semi-adequate overview,"Just took my 3rd PANRE and used this book/CD-Rom. On the surface, it is a good concept. There are some errors that need to be corrected in the pre-test. The GYN section has some odd wording. The format of the CD-rom could use a major overhaul. It feels crude, like I'm using Windows 95 all over again. We should be able to save a test and restart where we left off. And there are way too many topic categories. Now for content. Based on the version of the exam that I took today, the book needs much more in-depth coverage of geriatrics and pharmacology. If these items are addressed in the next 6 years, I'll use that version when the time comes."
1,Expensive Bin Liner,"If you have money to throw away, this is one good way of doing it. If you're serious about Luftwaffe 1946 subjects, look elsewhere - there are plenty of good titles around"
4,Good Shoe.,This is a great pair of shoes. It's comfy and lightweight. These shoes do run larger than normal so I recommend getting a half size smaller than what you usually wear.
5,The shoe is nice and the quality is good,The shoe is nice and the quality is good. I really like the casual style it brings!
5,Fantastic resource!,"This book is so well written, and truly is pretty darn ""comprehensive"", as the title says. The authors start with normal development, and lead you through the evaluation, goal writing and treatment process in such a coherent way. Many examples of actual children really help illustrate their points. Considering the cost of attending a feeding seminar, the price of this book is a good deal. Only wish I had time to read the book from front-to-back (it is over 600 pages)."
2,Could Have Beenn Better With More Facts.,"I cannot believe two Military historians wrote a reference book leaving out importnat birthdates, places and regions where most of the spys they cited grew up. For example, Claire George an outstanding American was cited, but no birthdates, hometown, educational background or region he came from was even listed, yet they claim they are historians. I know they may try to defend their poor research by saying spies hide their backgrounds but most of this information is readily available from easy sources. Consequently, I question the accuracy, research and details of a book that could have been great, but is only good for as a children's guide to Espionage from ages 10 through 14. Sorry, I expected more and want a discount for what I paid."
3,Fine & colorful fusion guitar album,"Kazumi switches to all-japanese line up with this 1992 album.Since smashing snare-drum and distorted guitar dominate sound palette, the sound of the album feels first a little bit heavy, but it does not take very much time to realize that the album is actually filled with the most different sounds and styles of music.Album does not have any killer compositions, but not any boring tracks either. Thus Kazumi seems to be a trustworthy composer. Some tracks are rock-jazz, some others have melodies that are more typical for contemporary jazz, and then many tracks are influenced heavily by some world music style (from latin to eastern tones).Not essential fusion or must-buy, but recommended forthose who like colorful guitar albums with fine compositions."
5,A fascinating personal look at Hungary in transition.,"Virginia White tells two equally engrossing tales in her fascinating new book: that of Hungary as it makes a difficult transition from Communism to western style capitalism and her own personal story full of adventures, mishaps, warmth, wisdom and humor. As a ""senior"" Peace Corps teacher in Hungary in the early 90s, White was well-positioned to observe the unprecedented turn-around in that country, and her insights into the politics, economics, and society of the time are right on the mark. But it is her talent as an observer of everyday details and her fascinating interactions with her new neighbors, friends, and students that make this book so hard to put down. One looks forward to reading the further adventures of someone who is far from being ""over the hill."""
5,A superb adventure and historic review,"Ms. Virginia White's book about Hungary is indeed a valuable edition to the genre, and I congratulate her for this volume and her splendid life."
1,The word sad comes to mind!!!!,"I have never read a Star Wars book that is as bad as this one. The author fails to capture the true personalities of the characters as we know them. I mean, when have you ever heard Han call C-3PO a ""friend""?? And also the book states that Luke carries a blue lightsaber, which he hasn't carried since Empire. Remember he built a green one after he lost his first one. Ok, so it's a little picky. But to me this says that Wolverton has seen the movies maybe once and doesn't pay attention to details. If you are looking for a good story, go for the books by Zahn."
4,Star Wars,While this is not one of my favorite Star Wars books it is an interesting story. It is also an important story. Characters introduced in this book will return in later ones. This also contains Han and Leia's wedding.
2,Not as good as other Star Wars Books,"For starters this book is not that great. I read the books out of series because that is how I acquired them and started with the Thrawn Trilogy. I was enthralled in that series and read the whole trilogy in less than 2 weeks. Then I found a copy of this book at the Goodwill and bought it with high hopes. Once I read the first chapter, I knew I was in for a long read. This books reads almost like a fantasy novel with the force witches being the main foe on Dathomir. The author makes Leia out to be a whiny little princess snob, C3PO as an annoying droid who all of a sudden has the ability to play music, and not to mention Luke as a know it all Jedi knight bent on the ""light side"" of the force. I found the book so boring it took me 6 days to read it. I say avoid this one at all costs."
5,Star Wars: The Courtship of Princess Leia,This was a great deal! The book was in excellent condition and exactly what I was looking for.
4,Very Good Book...,"I thought this book was a good addition to the Star Wars universe. I love the Dathomir Witches and Teneniel Djo. The Hapans were interesting and Isolder was one of my favorite characters. Overall, this book was great and deserved 5 stars except for the mis-characterisation of Leia and Han (especially Han) in some parts of the book. Han was never THAT dependent on Leia and in this book he can't live without her for 2 seconds. But as I said, the rest of the book (including the very well-done ending) makes up for that.-Murl"
4,A preety good book,It was an okay book but not the best. The Jedi Apprentice books are better though.
3,A Bit too Farfetched...Even for Star Wars,"There were things about this novel that intrigued me, but the majority of it had me scratching my head in utter dismay. I felt in no way threatened by this new rival for Leia's affections even if he does share some of the roguish, charismatic attributes which make Han Solo one of the most spectacular characters ever created. No one could seriously believe that the princess would ever consider leaving her ""scruffy-headed nerf herder"" even if it meant losing one of the most powerful alliances that the New Republic could ask for. I also found the idea of witches riding around on rancors to be questionable at best. However, there are some good battle sequences and enough Star Wars fun to at least give this one an average rating."
2,The Courtship Of Princess Leia,"Well, I expected more fights and more spacebattles and more action, but in this story they are stuck for about 75% of it on a planet that made me remember Endor with Tatooine. The story is not that good, Leia after all what she's been through with Han is not sure of her feeling towards him and kind of dates Prince Isolder. There aren't many battles, there are witches that have Force powers but they have to speak to be able to make them happen, they think of Luke as more powerful because he has powers and doesn't speaks while using them. Actually 2.5 stars, this is the second Star Wars book I've read, the first one was the Jedi Apprentice: The Rising Force, I'm about to start what's supposed to be the best one of the expanded universe novels, Heir To The Empire I hope for it to be really good given to all the good reviews."
5,This book is the best science fiction I've read.,"I thought that The Courtsip of Princess Leia was amazing. The non-stop action, the great space battles. I couldn't put it down. This book tells alot about the story of Luke Skywalker with new characters, It's probably the best Star Wars book ever"
1,the betrayal of princess leia,"Did Dave Wolverton ever read a star wars book? Has he seen the movies? HE totally destroyed the relationship they had at the end of the movies. Leia was *NASTY* to Han, dropping him the minute someone ""better"" came along. She acted as if he had no right to get upset as if they only dated once or something. Han acted whiney but who could blame him? They were totally out of character. Especially Luke. If i were Han I would have made Leia come crawling back on her hands and knees."
1,Terrible,"The romantic plot might be fine, and the development of the new characters was ok. The portrayal of han and leia was terrible. Their behaviors and mannerisms weren't even close to accurate. Ruined the book for me. Looks like I'm just going to have to rewrite it myself."
2,Poor quality Fan Fiction at best,"This honestly was a huge disappointment considering the author is considered to be of pedigree.Both Han and Leia were written appallingly out of character and whilst the premise was quite promising, the execution was nothing short of dire.This is dreadfully written fan-fiction, gussied up with an official cover and a publisher behind it. Save your money and just rewatch Empire/Jedi if you are looking for a dose of Han-Leia romance, because the scenes between the two in this book come NOTHING CLOSE to capturing the chemistry and sizzle between those two, whether they were throttling each other or making oogly eyes at each other in the dark corners of the Falcon."
2,Not quite up to par with other Star Wars books.,"Although this book had a half-decent storyline, I felt that many aspects of the book weren't ""Star Wars""y. For example, part of the greatness of Star Wars lies in the fact that groups of people (for example, Jedi) can be made up and yet seem so real to us. But in this book, there was one group of people called the Witches of Dathomir. To me, witches just don't fit in Star Wars. Second, this book was based on the premise that Han and Leia had been in love before, but were in danger of splitting apart. The third Star Wars movie showed a very definite love between Han and Leia, one which this book holds in very low regard. These and other aspects of the book made the story seem less relevant to the Star Wars universe."
5,Praise to Courtship of Princess Leia!,"A masterfully written, pumped up adventure with some of the most remembered characters of all time.This romantic, high action book, combines corlorful imagination and warm feelings to take you to a galaxy far far away..."
1,a silly and boring story,The author doesn't seem to know anything about the characters or the story. Leia would never consider marring anyone else even for the new republic. I couldn't believe she would just brush Han off like that. And Han would not turn into such a needy Whiner. Luke also was a dissapointment. He and Han are best friends and yet he doesn't defend him. Aweful Book.
4,This book is pretty good.,"I like that the empire has a new leader, Grand Admiral Thrawn,although it is quite annoying when he always knows what the New Republics next move is. I Hate Mara Jade, she gets on my nerves so much!Why in the world does she hate Luke so much? No wait, don't tell me, I can figure this out. Oh ya! She thinks that Luke ruined her life because he killed Jabba. (She supposedly was in Return of the Jedi) Actually Leia killed Jabba. Oh ya, she hates Luke because she was working for Emperor Palpantine, and she thinks Luke killed him. NewsFlash Mara! Darth Vader killed him."
5,This is the best STAR WARS book out there,"This is by far the best star wars book ever writen. The plot is fast moving and very exciting. The characters are well develope and interesting. This is a great book, but be warned, it is extremely addictive."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The main part of this is : should Princess Leia take the rich boypolitical marriage, for the good of the Republic, perhaps, or marry thescruffy Solo, who is far more likely to piss her off, and many timesmore capable of rescuing her from hordes of stormtroopers, evil empireslords, or other assorted bad guys that may be roaming around thegalaxy.Throw in some odd Force wielding women for no apparent reason."
1,Man was if awful!,"I found this book to be just terrible. It was certainly not written to keep how the Star Wars characters act. Leia, Han, Luke, and everyone was written as if they were some 60s war protesters. PLEASE. I was throughly disappointed with this book and don't understand how it could have ever been included in the Star Wars series."
5,Tecnical Difficulties,"This book was a good book as far as the storyline goes. It had many problems with the technology that makes Star Wars so special to me and many other fans. Some of the mistakes are:1. Blasters don't shoot blue bolts.2.Luke's lightsaber is green not blue.3.You can't just fly under a Super Star Destroyer's sheilds, or any ship's shields for that matter.4. You can't destroy the bridge of a Super Star Destroyer with a few conncusion missles.5. The Millennium Falcon does not have proton torpedos or ion cannons as part of its armament of weapons.6.You can't just destroy a tractor beam projecter by shooting at it or every ship that gets caught in one could get away easily. Despit all these facts this was a pretty good book. If you don't have it go get it and just don't pay attention to those mistakes. And may the Force be with you!"
