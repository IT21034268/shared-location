5,Incredible,"Monumental is incredible! Didn't really dawn on me that my generation (pre-1963) was the last to receive even part of the truth in education of the Puritan's plight. I remember at least seeing photos in our history books of people in England who fell asleep in church, in ""stocks"" and read of their tortures because of the Government-run church and the church as the mouthpiece for the government. Kirk does a remarkable job of telling this story. Not one single person born after 1963 should be without this. It could change a nation! Excellent, just excellent!"
5,Great!!!,Extremely interesting and informative. All our childern and politicans should be required to view this movie. I have recommended it to all my friends.
5,Monumental,This is a great video Everyone should see this. A great documentary on the history of our country and its founding. A lot of things are not recorded in our school's history books. I am sharing it with friends at church
5,Inspiring,"Learned so much about what made this country great, and how we could make it great again. It truly inspired me!"
5,Must Watch for Everyone,Watched this with my family. This is what America needs right now. The power to change America starts with us with help from God.
5,Monumental,"I found this documentary eye opening & inspiring. It is shameful how some will change the history of the freest and greatest country on earth for their own gain. If we have kids, they won't go to public school."
5,Monumental,"Great, Great movie. Every classroom in America should should be exposed to this film. Highly educational. Thank youKirk Cameron....."
4,Well done,This a a great resource that shows many items in our history that is never taught in schools. A must for anyone being taught about the Pilgrims.
1,Thinly Disguised,"When I bought this I thought it was Kirk Cameron's search for the foundation or history of America. Instead I was treated to closeups of Cameron's face throughout most of the video talking about one aspect of America's founding, the religious persecution of the Puritans - mostly at their departure points of England and Holland. Though the film vaguely established the concept of freedom of religion in America (which we have mostly lost today) it did not delve into the hardships they faced to survive and what they did to water this beautiful flower that is so rare nowadays."
1,Faulty disc,The product I received froze at several points while playing & I never could view the end of the movie
1,I wish someone else starred in this movie,"I think the premise of this movie is good. I wish it starred someone other than Kirk Cameron. Kirk Cameron is a very hate filled person. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Kirk Cameron hates the Church. He goes around spreading lies about the Church and posts videos on YouTube about our Church. Good Premise, wrong actor. This is just a review and I am not spreading any hate about Kirk Cameron. I am just informing the public.Here is a link to a video that Kirk Cameron himself says he dislikes Mormons. So in NO WAY am I being a hypocrite. [...]"
1,My Name is Not Susan,"The fact that I share the same first name as this religious zealot leaves me cold. Never a fan of ""Growing Pains"", I have still been confronted with his library of material that preaches and thumps as the fire and brimstone language prevails. Having grown up in a devoutly religious catholic household, I'm no stranger to what some deem as ""the holy word"". Kirk is certainly free to have his own religious point of view. It's only when judgment and condemnation comes into play, and that is often, that he truly leaves me cold. Here is another one of his self-righteous tirades on video for your dazzling pleasure. I can only hope it fades away as quickly as the others. If there was ever talent in Kirk's DNA, he keeps chipping away at it with his self-prophesizing. I'm awfully bored."
5,Everyone should see this!,"This is a wonderful history lesson, one we were never taught in school. It explains how the bible was the first textbook and that Congress published the bible. It motivates you to want to help get our wonderful country back to what our Founding Fathers fought so hard for to make it the greatest country. I highly recommend this movie, especially to our children."
5,Monumental Truth For Those Willing To Pay Attention,"This is a great film, but lacks the time to cover everything in depth. That would take a weekly series. As the true history of America's humble beginnings continues to be 'transformed', 'buried' and 'hidden', Monumental attempts to bring remembrance as to the foundations of the United States of America."
4,Superb,"This is the kind of doc that's worth a repeat viewing inside of a month of the first go-round. Cameron and company move fast. But the information is well presented and very insightful. I had no idea about the ""monument"" in Mass. Spectacular. Nothing ez or storybook-like in America's founding. All that sacrifice, death and hardscrabble progress ... and look where we are. Monumental throws open the window to the hardcore reality of our country's past -- while drawing a stark contrast between where the nation is now compared to then."
5,Great educational movie,This is a great movie telling a perspective of the founding of the USA. This should be a part of public school education instead of the current liberal perspective.
3,Special Places in Ireland - a disappointment,"I was looking for a few special places in Ireland, perhaps with historical background and context. Instead I find a book that looks a lot like the geographical listing of B&B's that I got from our our Innkeeper in Mendocino. It lacked the depth I was looking for. The book layout is nicely done with color pictures. Just not as special as I expected, especially since I found it as a write up in the Financial Times. The book is also dated."
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"I love pearls but wanted something a little more contemporary and less ""matronly"" than a string of pearls, and this necklace is just gorgeous. Excellent craftsmanship, and the perfect size, this necklace is my new favorite. The chain it comes with is wonderful--delicate but strong. I highly recommend this beautiful necklace and cannot say enough good things about it!"
5,cup holders,I purchased 2 of these Spectrum Diversified 34100 White Sliding Cup Racks to be installed in my new kitchen cupboards and they work great...everyone that sees them just rave over them..and ask where I got them.So handy to use and helps keep my cupboards very neat.
3,OK,Used on the butt end pg a 1918 violin. This stuff doesn't dry fast at all. I used clamps on the project. It does clean-up easy with water but too easy on my project.
3,Does not work With X50v running Windows 2003 SE,I tried the workaround described in the other review on this product and it did not work. I loaded the map in landscape and switched back to portrait. The GPS still did not work. This product is simply not supported for Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 second edition.
1,Works well as long as you don't drain the battery completely,This was a very good unit and helped me a lot while it worked. But I left the unit on once in my car to compeletely drain the battery and now it won't work even after a complete recharge. The unit simply has stopped sending any GPS data to the PDA/laptop.I would avoid it because it is only a matter of time before you will leave it on one day and that will be the end of it.
2,Recalled Due To Exploding Batteries!,"The unit itself works well but the software and maps are way out of date. There was a recall of these units due to exploding batteries so Belkin stopped making them and never released any updates. I got a new one still in the package and the battery was swollen so much the cover wouldn't fit but it still works. They are selling replacement batteries on ebay but beware, they won't fit."
2,Beware the hand of the Svehlas,"Despite the presence and Gary and Susan Svehla, some good material makes its way onto the page. As the ""editors"", though, the couple might have made another pass at Susan's shabby as hell ""Son of Frankenstein"" section. As it stands now, it's as self-satisfied and disorganized as their conventions . . ."
4,great fun,"My son always wins because he knows the movies really well. However, I don't know the movies very well, but I have a great time anyhow."
2,SHOULD be fun... but way too easy,"Yes, these Scene It games seem like a great concept, but especially for the Harry Potter editions, it fails. After all, there are a certain amount of books and movies (and the Scene It's seem to mostly rely on movies and somewhat one books, no more outside information), and most people who will be interested in playing it are Harry Potter junkies, who have most likely viewed/read all the movies and books. The Scene-It questions are simply too easy; the only people who may find it challenging are Harry Potter novices who haven't seen/read all the movies and books. In fact, the Scene It is so easy that, combined with it's slow transition speed due to flashy transitions, it become downright boring. Yes, I applaud the creation of this Scene-It series and I understand that the questions CAN'T be too difficult, but for most people who would even buy the game, it's too easy and not worth it."
3,Scene It? Harry Potter Deluxe Edition,"We have one of the earlier, generic versions of Scene It - Scene Jr., I believe. We've enjoyed it and were ready to try a new and different version. We've only played this one once so far but were a bit disappointed. The questions/clips don't give enough frame of reference for the player to ""fill in the blank"". For example, the question might be what character has been removed from the scene. You see a costume from the shoulder (not chest) to the neck with the head removed. You are given no clue as to which movie you are in and the time allowed to respond is brief. It becomes a guessing game rather than a challenge."
2,Methods in Metallurgical Analaysis,The book was published in 1915. The same one has been republished in paper pack in 2007. Since I am a Metallurgical Chemist I thought this new edition might be useful to present day-to-day. It does not fullfil the expectations. It has not incorporated the latest scientific advancement analytical work. The price I paid is high for the classical method description. I requested the publisher to send me the contents of the book as well the book for writing a review for the book. My request has been ignored and they have failed to send.The parcel has been kept below the mail and not delievered it in person.Dr.R.Raghavan
3,"An excellent starter camera, but I personally would wait for Nikon's new models coming out soon.","I bought this camera for an international trip. It did its job well, except in cases of low lighting and in museums. When it is unable to use its flash (in lower light than daylight) the picture quality tends to deteriorate substantially. Also I wish it had more than 3X optical zoom when it came to landscapes. Overall though I enjoyed this camera, and it worked well for me. However I do believe Nikon will be releasing their new models soon, and there is a better version of this camera in the new batch I believe."
1,Total Junk,"The picture quality stinks. I am buying another camera. Easy to use, but slow, and batteries need frequent charging. I went with nikon because of the reputation, but my 5 year old HP 315 2.1 MP takes picture 10x better than this piece of JUNK!!!"
3,Memory Card missing,"The camera was delivered this afternoon. However, memory card is missing. Without the memory card the camera can't be used."
3,USB Port not working,"I purchased this camera in June 2005 but suddently, its USB port develped fault and computer does not recogize it as USB device. I am sending it back to Nikon for repairs/replacement as it is still under warranty. Hope they fix/return to me promptly.Addition: I shipped the camera to Nikon and they fixed and returned it to me without charge. I am happy with Nikon's support."
4,Very Unacceptable packaging,"Camera was improperly packaged. There was no shock absorbent material in manufacturer's 3 X 5 X 8 inch unsealed box to protect camera and the ""polyair"" pillow packaging material within the 6 9 X 12 inch outer box was defective--the air chambers within the pillow were all deflated. This deflation allowed the inside box to bang around freely within the outer box during shipping. Recommend all electronic/photographic shipments untilizing this packaging approach be halted immediately! The probable internal damage to the camera has as yet been determined. However, you can be assured that I will advise Amazon.com of all problems detected in the near future. Donald Andersen"
3,It was not in the box,"It just came as a DVD, and an invoice. I was expecting a box. I hope it works like it should."
1,Doesn't work,I've bought 2 of these. Neither was capable of completely shutting off the flow of water: they both allow a slow dripping (1 drop every few seconds at standard house water pressure). A $2 garden hose part can achieve a proper seal. Why can't these? Did I just try two from a defective manufacturing run?
3,No depth,"I bought this album after the large amount of radio airplay the singles recieved. I wasn't disappointed, the songs are great. However I soon got tired of listening to it. I dn't know how to explain it, the music is impeccable, but it somehow seems to lack any soul. Still, I enjoyed it while it lasted."
3,Prior work was better,"White On Blonde is well produced, and Sharleen's voice is wonderful as always. The band performs splendidly, and the songs are well crafted. Unfortunately, the lyrics are a little weak, and they get a little repetitive.I personally prefer earlier work, particularly Ricks Road. On those, Sharleen sings in a lower register and sounds wonderful. The higher pitch of her singing on White On Blonde can wear after a while."
2,you can say what you want,"Being a texas fan right from the start...i have to say'white on blonde'was devastating,gone was the mature-ing rock sound of their previous 3 album's and especially the country rockish 'rick's road' and in comes this radio-freindly pop mush,that not only sells million's but reinvents them like the next abba or beach boys.(not that im against their success as they deserved that well before this release)sharleen sing's like an angel as normal but to these ears the music could have done with a lot more Oooomph.as far as i'm concerned 'say what you want'is the only track that comes anywhere near to their previous release's."
3,seems to lack something,"There's some really nice songs on this album, Black-Eyed Boy, Halo, Say What You Want. Those three were released as singles in the UK and got loads of airplay. The rest of the album is equaly well produced, there's no bad songs, but I just find I get bored of this album too easily, it seems to lack something, and I dont listen to it often. When I do, the feeling always surfaces that the music isnt pulling all the right strings.If you see it in the bargain bin it's worth a shot, but I wouldnt pay full price for it. There's usually loads of copies available second hand."
4,"Breathless, simply","I own all 5 Texas CDs, and this is the most unique. The last track, ""Breathless,"" is amazing. For those of you who own this, please take the time to listen to ""Breathless"" for its yearning sexiness and infectious energy. All though I have listened to every song several times, this is not an album I can play in its entirety. If you are a non-Texas fan, I would recommend either Southside or Mothers Heaven for your first album as those are more raw and passionate (and unique). Sharleen's voice is so good that I had to give WOB (White on Blonde) 4 stars. Without her talent, I would be disappointed for it seems Texas gets off their creative track in WOB. Perhaps its just because I'm spoiled by the genius of Southside. But Breathless and track 5 (Put your arms around me) make WOB worth the money. And Ms. Spiteri's talent takes the rest of these songs and makes them something worth noticing!"
5,Simply wonderful,The very first time I ever listen to this band (Texas) was during the spring of 1997...I was in Amsterdam and I immediately fell in love with this group....Well its 7 years later and I still love them...it bring back good and wonderful memories...God bless them :)
4,A surprisingly solid effort,"I first was intrigued by Texas after seeing a replay of the video for Say What You Want, and was pleasantly surprised to find that many of the other tracks on the CD are just as strong. There's nothing earthshatteringly original here, but this album somehow keeps finding itself in my CD player and humming through my mind nonetheless. It's a shame Texas are such unknowns here in the States..."
5,Most 'B' sides aren't as good as the 'A' sides but not here!,"When I bought this I had only really heard of the songs on the 'A' side and was expecting the others sides songs to perhaps not be as good, but I got an extremely pleaseant surprise when I found the 'B' side to be nearly as good as the first! Buy this album, you won't regret it!"
3,The transition has started,"As owner of the first 5 Texas CD's, this album marked the obvious transition of sound, song writing and direction that foretold Texas artistic dive yet assisted their commercial success overseas. After developing a listening relationship with their first 3 CD's, they changed gears and even after repeated listening I could never enjoy the ride. That said, this is by far better than ""The Hush"" and is quite tolerable. They are in their most experimentive mood to date and if you can erase the amazing soulful, alternative country substance they provided on ""Mother's Heaven"", then many of the songs will sound pretty darn good. In their defense, they tried to be a success with what they do best, but they couldn't crack the US market with it for whatever reason. It's quite a shame really. So, this is the next best thing, but that's hardly a ringing endorsement."
5,Just like a Camp Fire,This sounded just like a camp fire to me. The crackle of the wood and the outdoor animal sounds at night. I've had fun playing this indoors to create the mood of camping at night.
1,Great if you like Crickets,"I wanted the sound of a crackling fire. I HATE CRICKETS and the cricket noise is every bit as loud as the fire plus it never stops. If they had left the crickets off it would be better. With headphones on I can hear an occasional owl but not in an open room because the crickets are such a high pitch. I will keep looking for the right sound effect, hate this one."
2,subpar book,"Don't waste your money on this book! It does have a few useful bits of info but if you think you could build a gun using this book, think again. The black and white photos were so over exposed that you can't make out any detail, the drawings were so faint that half of them couldn't be seen and nearly all of them didn't have any dimensions.I'd suggest Gerard Metrals book ""A Do-it Yourself Submachine Gun"" if you have access to machining equipment.It's packed full of prints.Also try Bill Holmes later volumes 3, 4, and 5. He did a much better job on those."
2,Poor Drawings & Instructions,"This is the first volume in Bill Holmes ""Home Workshop Guns"" series and it suffers from poor drawings, illustrations, and instrusctions. Unless you already have a fair idea of what you are doing I doubt you would be able to make a working firearm based on this book.If you are looking for a clear, complete, and easily understood reference on how to make a firearm I would recommend Gerard Metral's ""Do-it-yourself Submachine Gun"" book instead. It has much better drawings, illustrations, and instructiions.Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun: It's Homemade, 9mm, Lightweight, Durable-And It'll Never Be On Any Import Ban Lists!"
3,Zombie-x,OK this book is a great book for any person that wants to make a weapon at home takes you step by step and is great fun. end product is quite good not to accurate but easy to fix enjoy.
4,Interesting,"It is interesting to note that The Flower of Life (Vol 1) has stimulated a huge disparity in terms of readers' judgements of its validity and usefulness. I agree with the nay-sayers who state that most (if not all) of the information contained in this book cannot be verified by standard reference methodologies. To be fair to Drunvalo, he does recommend discarding any information presented that does not feel comfortable intuitively. Some readers apparently feel that this applies to most of the material presented. He does not profess to be a 'scientist' and in fact stated his rejection of that form of informational hierarchy. His writing style is thus easy to read, as if you are talking with a friend. There is a huge amount of information presented in this book, and it remains to be seen if it really 'true' or not! Still worth a read in my opinion. I have not read Volume II but will take a look at it when it becomes available."
5,A Treasury of Consciousness,"Drunvalo Melchizedek takes us through an complex and fascinating journey through the evolution of humanity and the ancient which we all once shared.The Flower of Life is a symbol known throughout the world, as Drunvalo shows in countless photos. He goes through great detail the evolution of the symbol and how all science, indeed all creative evolves from this symbol.A treasury of information for the generations and a powerful contribution to humanity."
4,omg and wtf,"I'm in the middle of the volume 1 and have to vent. This is the worst written book i have seen . I hate it but I'm still reading it. I am tired of those "" I will explain later "" !!!!!u started it so finish it !!!! Its not that hard to make a connected story.I hope it will be rewritten In a way so it will have a beginning and an end without those "" I will explain later "" !!!!It has interesting info .Good luck to people without patience.Me myself I think I'm going kick this book around after I finish reading it :) makes me angry every couple of pages - don't wait for later !!!! Explain it NOW!!!! :)"
4,Very Interesting Reading.,"This book is very deep! Overall, I liked the book but got a little lost (bored) with the mathematical parts. I am definitely right brained and I know I was supposed to sit through the Left brained logical stuff, but I just could not. The parts about Egypt were very interesting reading. The illustrations were good and very convincing evidence. I had a little problem with his documentation. He does not relate his information properly and sometimes I was wondering whether he was referring to Toth or some other source. His future historical events correlate with other scientific, religious and new age books I have read so I think his sources are worthy. The truth about where we came from I need to research before I make my decision. Overall, I found some parts of the book with high credibility and then others I read with some skepticism. Still, I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking his or her higher self."
5,Awesome Book!,"Great information on the flower of life history. Plus I love the writing style of Drunvalo, so natural and comfortable reading."
3,It's O.K.,"The book was in good condition but it smelled a little moldy. Outside of the smell, I was satisfied with the purchased."
3,The Ancient Secrets of the Flower of Life: Volume 1,"This work is not for the beginner and knowledge of other works is necessary for a full appreciation of the secrets being unveiled.True, one needs to have a positive vibration to link in. The knowledge is stupendous and I feel the writer is immersed in his works totally and to have a similar feel you need to be immersed too."
5,Great follow up,I read the first book and couldn't wait for this one. Drunvolo takes this subject to a whole new level.
1,Not accurate!,Check out the real melchizedekmethod.com. This true system has helped thousands of people. Go within and check your heart.
4,Not for the spiritually timid or highly sketical,"Drunvalo is out there, way way out there, and yet I seriously enjoy his work. I'm also a fan of ancient wisdom, Flower of Life concepts and such. I can understand and sympathize with the reviewers who do not enjoy, appreciate, totally agree with him, but I still find his work very much worthwhile.If you like to read about speculative ideas like where we come from, if we have connections to aliens or other dimensions, theories on Atlantis, dolphins, crystals, Merkaba and astral travel, sacred geometry, spiritual masters and more subjects such as these... then I think you'll find this book and others by Drunvalo fascinating. At the very least, it's highly imaginative, thought provoking and entertaining."
1,Utter GARBAGE,"The claims made by this character are simply laughable. For instance, after an exhaustive search on medline, the largest scientific journal database in the world, there was not ONE link to an article on these amazing children in china. Furthermore, a websearch for schools that teach these superpowers simply do not return any valid hits. You would suspect that this would be a booming business since I'd pretty much give my left arm for them. Furthermore this man is a charlatan peddling so called super water that is simply theoretically impossible. For all the good work so many people have done to advance our knowlegde of sacred geometry and esoteric knowledge, this man eradicates in two volumes. Do yourself a favor; spend a little more and buy books by:Viktor Schauberger, Graham Hancock, Gregg Braden and Franz Bardon."
4,Hey! get out of my merkaba!,"For those who are unfamiliar with Drunvalo Melchizedek, he claims to be a twelfth dimensional walk-in who has studied with 72 teachers from ALL religious paths. One of his first teachers had a massive underground laboratroy in Burnaby B.C. and he had unlocked the secret of the philosopher's stone - he could transmute lead to gold! he is a soft spoken man wiht a pony tail who plays the flute. he is a man who is somehow simultaneously arrogant and humble. A man who is making a LOT OF MONEY of his books and seminars, but, hey, a guys got to make a living, right?the book is an excellent introduction/intermediate text on Sacred geometry with lots of nice big pictures/diagrams."
4,"Fascinating, juicy","A deep look at all the mysteries of life and the universe...at least some juicy bits. Great source of explanations, theories, to mentally chew on, even if they don't make sense or i agree with. Ties together a lot of different threads. So i rate this book high for philosophical/metaphysical variety, in depth explanation of certain ideas, profundity, and blending reasoned and researched material with more speculative stuff. But i stop short of 5 stars because parts of the book are sloppy, sometimes having a quickly-thrown-together feel."
5,"Amalgamates Science and Spirituality; Past, Present and Futu",My personal quest over the past 50 years has been varied; from one subject to another but only thru this book have I found connection. A fascinating book to forward any persons quest for truth.
4,Left brain approach to spirituallity,"Reading Drunvalo was my intorduction to Thoth and sacred geometry. Overall, I think that this is a good book that combine anthropology, physics, spirituallity and geometry. Very good intro to the synthesis of these ideas. I feel that the most valuable aspect of this book is that it attempts to give a mathematical perspective to the unity of the universe and it elucidates that thru creation itself that the infinite source not only pours out his essence but presents its omniscience within and throughout the phenomenom of manifestation."
1,Disgrace,"this is such an interesting subject that this man has disgraced. people like this give a bad name to people making a true attempt at discovering the truth, such as Graham Hancock. pitiful. stay away from this garbage."
1,Nonsense,"""....I am so utterly important that ""...for twenty-two years, the angels have asked that I teach people...through workshops.."" and ""Because you and I are One with the Creator...you must change yourself first..."" ...and, I know all about changing the you that does not exist and can show you in a seminar for a small fee that, as Nisargatta has said, ""liberation is not of a person, it is FROM a person,"""
1,silly.,"I consider myself pretty open minded with respect to ""new age"" things, but this book was ridiculous. Melchizidek has an irritating tendency to refer to this and that latest (pseudo)scientific discovery without giving any references at all.It would have been better if he had not attempted to give references at all, and said that he ""channeled"" the whole thing."
2,flower of life,"entertaining, but i think we're living in a more complex universe than this guy seems to realize. if not, save me a seat on the UFO."
5,I bought this on the strenghts of the reviews here,"I bought this CD on the strenght of the reviews never heard of the group but a big fan of October Project. I did not know what to expect and boy was I surprized how great this is, I've listened to Eventide twice and think I will have a hard time getting it off my cd player. Thank you all for enlightning me to a great group."
5,You won't be dissappointed.,I have not heard songs this varied and interesting since the Beatles! Listen to this CD 3 or 4 times and then try to get these songs out of your brain. This band went from obscurity to being my favorite in a matter of days. I have seen them live twice - they don't miss a beat.
5,Habit Forming!,"Grey Eyed Glances is one of the better regional bands in Philly, and this CD shows why. Recaptures the spirit that Natalie Merchant lost when she left 10000 Maniacs. GEG recently perfomed at the Appel Music Festival in NJ with, among other artists, Indigo Girls, and by far had the best set."
5,Outstanding CD,"One listen to this band and you'll be hooked. Beautiful vocals by Jennifer Nobel, catchy harmonies, and also some mean bass and lead guitar. Every song is great -- how many albums deliver like that??"
5,EVENTIDE..FLOWS ABOVE THE OTHERS,I've never bought a CD that I liked all the way through from the first play..until now.....GEG (Eventide) is a masterpiece that I cannot turn off..Every play of the CD evokes new emotions...I stumbled upon GEG while browsing Annie Haslam's (of Renaissance) site..She recommended GEG and if it comes from her..I thought they must be good...No disappointment here..I must say musically..lyrically top notch and vocally...the sound of an angel !! If you buy no other CDs this year.. do yourself a favor and get this one.. You won't regret it !!
3,Pleasant But Not October Project,"Grey Eye Glances was recommended as another quality, alternative-pop band in the vein of October Project. Indeed, the music is pleasant and, after several listens, I have enjoyed the album but hardly place it on the same plane as the late October Project. The two band's ochestrations are comparable in range and quality. The repitore is interesting. ""Snow"" is particularly thoughtful while ""Angle"" has an almost lullaby quality. The Country flavor of several tracks (e.g., ""In the Company of You,"" ""Chills,"" ""These Walls"") was unexpected. While versatile, clear and bright, Jennifer Nobel's voice in no way approaches the depth or Celtic flavor of Mary Fahl, OP's lead vocalist. This is a feel-good collection lacking the introspective, mature lyrics and haunting quality of October Project. I recommend Eventide. It's a fine CD, but will disappoint those looking for an October Project facsimile."
5,"Excellent, thoughtful recording. Very creative.","An outstanding band from Philadelphia. They have intelligent lyrics, rare musical talent, and outstanding song-writing. Should be especially appealing to fans of Peter Gabriel. They are OUTSTANDING live"
1,Wrong CD sent!!!,"I ordered this CD a few weeks ago and received an email confirmation from the seller, MGI Warehouse. Strangely the confirmation asked that I NOT write a bad review even if I was not satisfied with the product. I thought that odd but gave them the benefit of the doubt. When the CD arrived it was the wrong one. I promptly returned the wrong CD and asked to be refunded for the cost or have the correct CD sent to me -- that was over a month ago and I have still heard nothing.Guess I should have anticipated a problem when the original confirmation asked me to not write a bad review. But you give bad service, you get a bad review -- deal with it!"
2,bad television commercial music,"[I was]recommended this title.. Obviously their bot needs work. While the vocalist has a beautiful voice, and the production is good, the music and orchestration are trite and the lyrics are overwrought. I gave it two full listens, and both times I ended up feeling nauseous. It's going out."
1,Junk!,"Blade fell off the first time I tried to use it. Thanks to Amazon, I rec'd a full refund. I gave it a 'one' only because Zero is not offered. What a waste!"
2,Major Disappointment!,"Although there is nothing like the pure voice of Virginia Rodrigues, this album was a MAJOR disappointment. Her first album was wonderful, her second OK, and this one, unfortunately, is in most ways a failure. The arrangements are unimaginative and they have sort of a Lawrence Welk quality, and most of the tracks lack any Afro-Brazilian feel at all. I hope that on her next album she goes back to the popular Brazilian rhythms and melodies that made her first album such an amazing musical achievement.If you want true Afro-Sambas, try to find the original 1966 album, with Baden Powell and Vinicius de Moraes, which is available as part of the 13 CD Baden Powell box."
2,A profound disappointment compared to Nos and Sol Negro,"If you liked Nos and Sol Negro, you may not like this one as much - I didn't. It feels very 1960s tired and hasn't the same energy and life of Rodrigues' first two albums. I listen to those all the time; I won't listen to this one much."
1,Usually a big fan!,"I love all Dr.Brown products. Maybe my complaint should be with Amazon. I made my purchase on April 7th I believe, today's date is April 29th and I have yet to receive my bottle brush. I am so frustrated I don't even know if I will order anything else from Amazon.com"
1,Don't buy,"I got it as a shower gift, my baby is 4 weeks old and the thing broke already, just washing bottles, nothing special, buy the avent one instead, its great. sorry dr. browns, the bottles are great."
1,horrible,i do not like this one it fell apart with in a week of us the bristles fell out so i had to go get another one i would not recommend it to no one its a waste of money sorry
2,sponges lasts like a week...,"Unless you use your hand and squeeze the sponge to insert it into the bottle, the sponge will tear apart within a week!"
2,Wire Stem is an Achilles Heel,"These worked really well for bottles and sippy cups but I went through several, all meeting the same fate... the wire stem snapping in half."
2,You'll have to replace often,"Eh, it meets all of my criteria, except durability, which is a big one. I like a foam/sponge top, it soaps up better. I like a brush that stands up, and one with a part you can insert into the nipple to get it clean. This brush has all of these, but the foam disintegrates after a month or two. Not terrible, but the Munchkin brand has all my requirements PLUS has lasted forever, even when I put it in the dishwasher to resanitize."
2,Dr. Brown's Bottle Brush,I don't know why I bought this since I put my granddaughter's bottles in the dishwasher. The cost was a lot more than if I'd bought one at a store. The suction cup doesn't stick to the sink and the brush handle comes out of it. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Don't buy this brush!!!,"This brush has a wire stem that is very flimsy. After a few weeks or a month of use, it starts bending and then breaks. The first time it broke, I thought it was a fluke. The second time one broke, I came on here and read all the negative reviews of other people's brushes breaking. I think it's pretty lame the company is not fixing this problem."
1,Former Fan of Dr. Brown Bottle Brush,"I was a former Dr. Brown fan for my first born. I bought replacements for my second born recently and found myself DISAPPOINTED. The subcontractors they use to mfg. their brush is inferior. I still have the original brush (1.75 yrs. old) from my first born and it's held up, except for the sponge tip which is expected; but the new ones last about after a month worth of use. It was like cleaning with a pipecleaner, after about a month the wire stem snapped and rendered useless. It's a smaller gauge wire than before, so I question the material they use to manufacture all of their other products.Buyer beware!!!"
1,Not worth it! Don't buy!,I went with this brush along with Dr Brown's bottles. I must say this product is a shame to bear Dr Brown's name. It lasted for a month after which the stem snapped and it has become useless.
1,Very poor quality - don't waste $$$,"I bought this brush thinking it would do a better job at cleaning my doctor brown bottles and I was thoroughly disappointed! I've used it for about 3 weeks now and the wire just snapped! Like another reviewer mentioned, it's like cleaning with a pipe cleaner...poor quality. I much prefer to use the Munchkin brand."
1,Fell apart and is totally useless,We bought one of these when our other bottle brush was old.The wire thing that the brush is on came out of the handle! We used it without the handle for a day before we went and bought another brush. This thing is cheap and horrble.
2,Tears apart easy,The foam part at the top of the brush breaks down easily. After only a week of having this brush the foam is already tearing apart.
2,not long enough for my water bottles and very flimsy,"I have water bottles that this doesn't work well for... I also have the munchkin which is even shorter however what I dislike about this one is that it is extremely flimsy. I feel like I cant give the inside of the baby bottles / shorter water bottles a good scrubbing due to it bending. Other reviews say this breaks over time, I have only been using mine for 1 week. I hope it doesn't break soon, I would give this less stars then."
3,"Liked the design, but quality was not good for price paid","When I first received this brush, I really liked the quality of the sponge and the fact that the plastic handle extended up to the base of the bristles. I had another brush where the handle stopped a couple inches below the bristles and the brush began to bend after a month of using it. So, while the Dr. Brown design was better, I've been using this brush for about a month now and the sponge piece has unfurled and makes it annoying to clean with. Additionally, the sponge did begin to disintegrate after a couple of weeks, which made me wonder how long the brush would last. For the money spent, I don't think I would purchase this again."
2,"Works well, broken after two months of daily use.","The brush works well while it lasts, but is now broken after two months of use.This is my second one and the wire that holds the brush in place bends and breaks, I will not be buying a third."
2,Wire stem breaks,"Initially, I was very happy with the brush as it did a good job of cleaning the wide babies bottles we have. However, after only about 2 months of use, the wire stem broke making it useless."
2,Falls apart within months,"Within two months of normal use, this bottle brush started to fall apart ... it began with the sponge. Small parts were breaking apart during each use. Within another month's time, I noticed that the wire began to twist out of shape, seemingly loosening during each subsequent use. It finally broke rendering the entire brush useless. I will not be purchasing again, especially after reading similar reviews."
2,"Great Brush, Horribly Flawed Design","This was the first brush we used when our baby was born. The sponge does a great job of cleaning out the bottles and smooth surfaces and holds onto soap well, while the brush bristles aren't so stiff that they flick soap everywhere. Of the brushes we've tried, this one did the best job of cleaning.However, the fatal flaw is the wire construction that holds the whole thing together. It weakened very quickly at the point where it attached to the base, and it snapped completely off before the baby's 1-month birthday. The wire itself is thick, but the point where it attaches to the base is not able to handle the force or pressure exerted on the brush by everyday bottle cleaning.It's a great brush, but don't expect it to last more than a month."
2,"One of the only ""misses"" from Dr. Brown's","I've invested a small fortune in Dr. Brown's products (bottles, warmer, sterilizer, drying rack, mixing pitcher, and formula dispenser!), and thankfully all of those items that were paid for worked out really well. This bottle brush came free with the bottles I purchased, and I'm glad it did--I would've been really disappointed if I'd spent any money on it.The issues I had were:1. the sponge at the top disintegrated after about 3 weeks of regular use2. water and soap sprays everywhere when you remove the brush from a bottle3. the bristles on the brush weren't dense enough to really clean the bottles wellAfter a few weeks, I gave up on it and purchased thePhilips AVENT BPA-Free Bottle Brushinstead--the bristles are really dense, and they're only around part of the brush, so if you pull it out with the bristles faced-down, they don't spray on you at all."
2,Not really designed well for Dr. Brown's bottles,This bottle brush says it's great for Dr. Brown's bottles.....but the sponge at the top is too big to get into the blue stem that goes into the bottle. And there is nothing that cleans the beige rubbery thing that connects to the blue thing. The brush only cleans the bottle itself. The rest of the millions of pieces of the bottle cannot be cleaned with this. Not quite sure how they think this design cleans their bottles and its PARTS.
2,Flimsy wire and sponge on bottom,"We've tried every bottle brush out there, this one is one of the worst ones we tried. The wire bends very easily and the sponge on the bottom of it rips apart.The sponge on the bottom was one of the main reasons we tried it. We use glass bottles and it's near impossible to get bottoms clean with a regular bottle brush. It did get the job done for a few days before it started to rip. The suction cup on the bottom was a plus also.By far the best bottle brush we ever tried, bought three years ago and still use till this day on our kids sippy cups, is the Avent bottle brush. Worth. Every. Penny.Philips AVENT BPA-Free Bottle Brush"
3,Better than the Munchkins Bottle Brush,"I've only bought one other brush to compare (Munchkins Bottle Brush) so I wound up purchasing the Dr. Brown Bottle Brush again.PROSSoft bristles and the tip foamCONTip foam (because it is soft, it doesn't stay in tact)Munchkins foam was much more durable looking but the bristles were too harsh so I don't like using that one. Even though the Dr. Brown bottle brush didn't hold up as well as I would've liked and is more money, I still liked it better than the Munchkins one because that one is just too rigid and tough but that's my personal preference."
3,Falls apart,"I give this a 3 because that foam tip thing falls apart pretty quick. I guess it can last a month or so. Maybe less. I'm not really sure how long a bottle brush should last actually. I haven't done any detailed comparison (yet), but I did order a few other brands just to try out a variety because I wasn't really in love with this one. ""It's OK"" as the 3 star review states."
3,"works ok, but won't last long.","the colored sponge part is too stiff. so if you have to squeeze it through a narrow neck bottle ( and by narrow, i mean standard), eventually the sponge with rip and then break.the munchkin ones are better.one thing i do like is the suction cup stand. but i still wouldn't buy this brand again."
2,The metal neck broke after 4 mos.,"We don't use this brush frequently, we mostly wash our bottles in the dishwasher. Despite this the brush still broke at the next after 4 mos. I knew it was coming because around 3 mos, the brush was already bent and wouldn't stay straight when you applied slight pressure.I would recommend a brush that does not have a twisted metal neck. There are other brands out there that fit this description."
4,Great brush but doesn't stand the test of time,"This brush is perfect for Dr. Brown and other bottles. The nipple cleaner works great on our Dr. Brown nipples. But the brush doesn't hold up that well and I am already on my second one in 6 mos. Then again, I wash a lot of bottles and it is fairly cheap."
2,not recommended,"I used to use this as our primary bottle brush but now use it as a back-up, for traveling, etc. It does the job okay, but the sponge has started to break apart. The suction cup seemed kind of pointless too - it doesn't hold well enough to be on a counter surface. I much prefer our First Years brush, complete with the tiny little nipple scrubber that folds out. It's held up a lot better too.The First Years Bottle Nipple Brush"
2,short lived,"This brush does a great job till the sponge starts falling apart. We have long glass 7oz bottles. Once the sponge begins to wear out, you can't really clean out the bits of milk on the bottom of the bottles."
2,Sponge End wont last long,"brush actually works great, but i see chunks of sponge coming off almost daily after use. not very well made for durability."
2,better ones available,"I have tried this one and the munchkin one.Donot waste money on these two .Buy the ""bornfree"" bottle brush for the most thorough cleaning."
5,Best Bottle Brush,"I've purchased so many bottle brushes of many different brands and this one is by far the best, it's definitely worth it!"
3,"love the sponge tip, but don't like the nipple brush","I love the sponge tip, find it easier to wash than those without sponge, and use less detergent. I also like the suction base. But I don't like the hard nipple brush. I can't use it to clean small parts from breast pump, and it doesn't clean as well as those bristle nipple brush."
5,Rose Flower With Pearl,"This pendant with chain is to die for. Everywhere I go I get ""WOW THAT""S PRETTY"""
3,Surfer Dude,"""Surfer,Dude"" is okay for a surfer movie. He wants to surf so bad he goes to Mexico when the waives are gone in california.I recommend it to fans of Matthew McConaughey and fans of surfing."
2,Love this movie..but,I have loved this movie since I first saw it on cable. I looked forward to the Blu-Ray version. On my copy the sound is just ok and the video looks terrible...dark and grainy. It's like the production people just ran it through a grinder. Everything else on my TV looks great so it's not a settings issue. I'll try again with another version but this one is going into the 'do not play pile'...unfortunately!
2,The Beginner,"i liked various parts of this movie.....but the smoking pot and drinking doesn depict who surfers really are this part was bad judgement of directing the cast memebers.Now as new comer to the world of surfing and all its postive energy, i like what they did with over all concept, i've always been a fan of surfing i'm glad i get to live my dream and i hope that they continue to make better movies, j.k.livin production and show surfer in a better light."
2,Not impressed,"A movie about a surfer, that is really a movie about smoking weed. I wish that I could get a refund."
2,"Too much nudety, not enough surfing.","I enjoyed the movie, except for all the nudety. It was discouraging that it portrayed surfers to be just a bunch of partying pot heads and drunkards, with lots of sex orgies. I've been surfing for forty five years, with a bunch of other well known surfers, who've lead more productive lives than this. This has a negetive impact on the younger generation of surfers and the surfing community. I enjoy Mathew's movies, and especialy surf movies, but this was a big let down, it's like a flat day, or in his case fifty eight days without surf. This movie is'nt even worth loneing out for my friends to watch."
5,"It's about a surfer, not surfing","I see so many reviews about this that say it isn't surfing. How many of you have hung at the beach and surfed every day? I know lots of surfers who are just like Addington. If you hang at one break long enough you'll find them and generally it doesn't take long! I enjoyed this movie cause it was about a surfer who finds his ""world"" under attack and has to deal with the greatest hardship (no waves) that could happen. Have you ever lived through a wave drought? Usually won't last longer than a week but it sucks none the less! It didn't have slash and burn hardcore surf footage: so what? It's not a surf video. Having Keith Malloy double as Addington in the water was good style. He rips on a longboard. I rate this highly because it's an accurate depiction of what some surfers are like and how they are focused on nothing but waves!"
4,"something's bogus, dudes","This is a simple movie, not made to be dissected, competed with or watched for the plot or action. rather, the film provides a taste of SoCal that is partly mythical and partly disappearing and for that alone i loved it.there's something wholesome about the film, left me feeling good which does not happen too often for me, and almost never with the large commercial blockbusters. to see Willie Nelson's smile, that alone was worth waiting for. mcConnaughey does a good job, as does Harrelson & most of the crew.in other words, this is not about surfing. it is about friendship and about knowing what you love."
1,Waste of time,"This movie is a complete waste of time. I happen to be a surfer, which is what got me interested to rent this movie in the first place. Everything about this movie is unbelievable. The plot sucks, and the production seems like you are watching a low-budget movie from the 80's. Almost like the intro to some 80's porn. It is a complete insult to what surf culture is about. We are not all stoners!"
1,WIPEOUT (IF YOU'RE NOT STONED) -- EVEN IN BLU-RAY,"Haven't seen this movie stoned and don't plan to. I love the ocean, and the surf culture but this vanity production -- no doubt a blast to make -- is a bore to watch. And that is really, really sad because all the undisputed screen charisma of Matthew McConaughey, Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson and Scott Glenn is utterly wasted on this episodic and stultifying vanity production that looks great in it's Blu-ray, hi-def clarity. But honestly, it's like looking at a turd in sharp focus. I wish it weren't so.There is a commentary with the affable McConaughey that, while minimally amusing, does not really answer the not so burning question of exactly why this movie was made or what it's supposed to be about. My amateur videos of fun times in Malibu, the North Shore and French Polynesia have infinitely more fun and big waves. I am so disappointed. I had high (no pun here) hopes for ""Surfer, Dude."""
3,COOLER THINGS IN THIS WORLD THEN A HOUSE MADE OF CORN,"Matthew McConaughey plays Malibu's Steve Addington, a man who defines ""surfer."" The maker of a virtual reality video game wants Steve to become one of the avatars of the game by getting wired up and riding a mock surf board while wearing reality glasses. Steve doesn't want to do this. He wants REAL surfing...and that was pretty much the film.Steve speaks surfer-ese, a dialect of the Cannabis language group. His language is understood by his manager played by Woody Harrelson, and farmer friend Willie Nelson.The comedy was light. The drama fake with characters you never really know or care about. The film is about not selling out, but when you have no real values, what is there to sell out?PARENTAL GUIDE: Pot Smoking, F-bomb, hard body nudity."
1,STINKS,This is one of the worst movies ever made. I happen to see it for free and I think I should get a refund for wasting my time.
1,Quite possibly the worst movie ever filmed.,I wish I had spent my time paying the kid down the street to hit me really hard with a board over and over again than watch this movie.Here's a suggestion to anyone trying to make a movie: have a plot.The only entertaining thing about this movie is the laugh I got at reading about everyone else's horror as well. I would rather face a firing squad than watch this movie ever again.
1,"Weak, Lame, and Feeble.","This is a very poorly done movie and is not entertaining. Some, might try to give it a chance, but the fact is, it never gets better, and it starts out lame. If you have never surfed, or your child never has, get them a lesson, and take picswith the video on your digital cam, and it will be more entertaining than this movie. Easy to see why it flopped so bad, and hard to believe it was even released for dvd viewing.The one good thing about it, is when you watch the next movie you regard as boring, not entertaining,and dull, compare it to your viewing of this one, and suddenly the other will become magnificent in comparison. Do notwaste your time, unless your goal is to waste time, or you insist on punishing yourself for some unknown reason."
3,Riding the wave with Matthew,"I attended the premiere in Austin, Texas and enjoyed watching this film on the big screen as well as meeting the cast and crew.I'd say it has alot of eye candy in it. If you're a guy you might enjoy the gratuitous chest shots of girls running around at the mansion.And as a female who enjoys looking at Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, there's plenty to admire there. My favorite part of the movie was the soundtrack. It's the only thing that gives you any hope in this eco-sad situation. Just keep livin'..."
2,It was okay,"I expected the songs all to be done by the original artists. This is not the case on this CD. However, it does have a good variety of artists and songs. My husband and I do enjoy it."
4,Tactfully done.,"Excellent book for those children wondering where babies come from. Tactfully shows children all the various ways they may have heard before. In the end, the importance is that we come from Mommies. Very cute book."
4,Great,I enjoy the entire series as a child and have set out to purchase the entire series for my children.
3,Enjoyable,"First off, can I just say that I don't think the cover art is helping this book at all? Now that I have that off my chest, I will say that I enjoyed this book. There's nothing here that blew my socks off, and I probably won't remember anything about this book in a month, but I read it in one sitting on a cold rainy day and I enjoyed it while it lasted. I didn't hate anything about it. I didn't really LOVE anything about it either, but I did LIKE it a lot so that makes it worth what I paid for it. As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the author does have a tendency to repeat certain phrases (and how did a girl like Sarah, living in the circumstances she did, get her endless supply of rose scented soap anyway?), but other than that the writing is fine. I also enjoyed the secondary characters of UTE and Big Lola a lot. I will definitely give this author another try.**Edited to say they changed the cover art since I wrote this review. Much better."
3,Nice story.,"This story was good enough to keep my interest, but it was definately missing something in the beginning. If I knew what it was, perhaps I'd add another star."
5,Ms. Lowell [aka Ann Maxwell] IS great!,"I cannot recall a book by Lowell / Maxwell that I have not liked. ""Winter Fire"" is no exception. The plot seems straight forward enough: Sarah Kennedy ownes some land that a group of bad guys, better known as Culppepers, covet. Case Maxwell -love the name- has been hunting this particular bunch of outlaws for some time, seeking revenche for the murders of his niece and nephew. Together hero and heroine will defeat evil and find true love and happiness. What makes this book remarkable, in my opinion, is that the main and secondary characters are well developed. The dialogue is fast and smooth. The love scenes are, as always, well written -hot and sensual, gentle and sweet-. The much-maligned happy ending is satisfactory in many ways. There is a sense of growth for the main characters and a sense of closure for the reader when reading the Epilogue. This is one of those books you read that make you feel good about life without being mushy or syrupy."
2,There are worse albums than this one...,"...but I listen to them even less! I bought this album at random a few years ago. My first impression after I bought it was ""mediocre British band"". I've listened to it a couple times since then, the most recent today, and my impression hasn't changed. If it weren't for the fact that Brian Eno contributed to this album I'd probably give it one star."
3,Is that correct?,"Much better than the others -- when I was a girl, all the Barbies were blond anyway. But this Princess of the Korean Court doll... hmmm, aren't the turquoise tops for the servants? The upper maids yes, the Sang-goong, but not the princess. More research please, Matel."
4,Wonderful,"I like Korean hanbok but Mattel makes this hanbok looks cheap because of the sticker details. Her arms can't expand and her heels doesn't fit her too. Her eyes need to be a little more slant. However, I like how this barbie looks so graceful. Also, I like it how Mattel are making different princesses' cultures barbie dolls."
1,PROBABLY THE LEAST APPROPRIATE REPRINT COVER IN THE WORLD,"This is an excellent book about time spent on the west coast of Ireland. It is a classic of its kind, and originals are very hard to come by.That said, this particular edition shows just how much the reprint market cares about its products - not much if at all.The book may have ""wild west"" in its title, granted, but the laughable cover of this reprint takes us from the wilds of Connaught to the land of the stetson, six-shooter, lassoo and wagon-wheel. The question is, dear Elibron Classics / Adamant Media Corporation, in which part of cowboy country do you suppose Connaught to be?A 5 star book degraded by no-star publishing."
5,Amazing!! Weird!!,This is an enjoyable set of four episodes of Movie Macabre. The amazing thing is that the Hercules and the Captive Women episode uses a 16:9 widescreen print of the film. The weird thing is that the surrounding Elvira segments are done 4:3. Very strange.
5,A great DVD for generations to come.,"You can't help but love the Combination of Elvira Mistress of the Dark and the greatest 'B"" films out there. This is fun for all ages. There is a reason Elvira is still around and its not just the twins =o) Recommended for All."
1,"No aroma, no taste","I have had this tea in England and this bears no resemblance whatsoever to what I had in the UK. No taste, no aroma."
2,There is nothing funny about the Bush White House,"The current Presidental adminstration will already go down as one of the worst in American History. Stealing the 2000 Election, the mistakes made on the war on terror after 9/11, getting us caught in a war that is Vietnam all over again, getting advice from military people who have the brains of two year olds, and having spokespersons at the news conference who have the people skills of a bully three year olds. These cartoons are not funny, they are sadly all too real."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on,"I just paid $US13 for this book (362 pages PDF) and read it in less than 2 hours. I keep my word program open as I read in order to make notes on salient material---I wrote two lines---and those I didn't bother to save. What a waste of time. This book, if it's good for anyone, is for someone who wants an overview of a writer's life. It isn't any use to someone already in the field: you already know everything this writer has to say."
3,murky followup to The Well-fed Writer,"The market demanded this book so Bowerman put it out.It's okay. It's mostly more of the same - it doesn'tmuch represent a leap from the first book so much asit's like a 284 page appendix... useful material but muchof it would have been edited out or folded into thefirst book if they were published as one volume.Not particularly flawed - but like many business booksit's padded out with 3rd-party stories - enthusiasticand informative vignettes from succeeding freelancerswho liked the first book and wrote in to Bowerman toshare their stories.Major points - cold calling isn't so bad, marketingisn't so bad if you think about it in a nice way,professionalism matters, consistency pays off.Fairly toothless, but inspirational. If you read thefirst book and need a little more encouragement tojump into the marketplace and do the business thismight be the push you need.Worth reading but if you are already hustling work asa freelancer you may find it redundant."
5,Writing IS a business!,"Peter Bowerman has challenged the publishing ""world""in instructing and encouraging writers that it IS possibleto write (and eat, too!). In Back for Seconds, Bowermanprovides great marketing tips and methods that will benefitALL entrepreneurs to review on a regular basis! I willcertainly add this book to the resource chapters of my books'future editions! Priscilla Y.

3,Overpriced & not worth it,"Dream Dance, like its sibling Tunnel Trance Force (TTF), is released by the German division of Sony. Both of these series showcase the latest EuroTrance/club anthems, but TTF is mixed and very fast, while Dream Dance is slower and NOT mixed. But they both share many of the same tracks.In the case of Dream Dance Vol. 24, you'll notice that its tracklisting is very similar to TTF 21, which is a brilliant mix by DJ Dean. For the true club feeling, the adrenaline rush, and non-stop action, get the Tunnel Trance Force. Ultimately, Dream Dance is not worth it."
3,Just O K,"I served in SAC for over 4 years in the 50s & bought this book thinking it would contain a lot of history, but most of it is just pictures of SAC aircraft.Be interesting to get from a library but not worth paying for. In fact I am giving this one to the local library."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"This should have been a worthy tribute to SAC but its content has been badly let down by appalling standards of reproduction.Schiffer books are not cheap and this one is no exception so it would be reasonable to hope that the highest standards of printing would prevail. Not so! There's hardly a pure black or white tone in the whole book - nothing but muddy greys. The colour shots (those that aren't faded overall to pink, that is) have tone reproduction that is harsh, contrasty and garish.I've bought other Schiffer books and been happy with the print quality so this one came as a surprise and a big let-down. If you see this book on sale at half-price, save your money - it really doesn't deserve shelf space."
3,Double Bogey effort,"As much as I liked Missing Links and almost all of Reilly's books, this one was disappointing. The characters are great but they need to be updated with new material. MKissing Links was a great read that this sequel does not do justice. Funny in spots but mostly contriveed. I think Rick missed on this one..."
2,Not Worth The Time,I always look forward to Rick Reilly's SportsIllustrated articles so waslooking forward to this read--but what a waste of time. He uses far too many 'cutsie' sayings and every related sports ideas that has come along in the last five years and it just wanders along on a path to nowhere. Save your money and buy a book by David Halberstam or David Moraniss orLeigh Montville.Not Funny. . .Total waste of time and money.
1,Shanks for nothing is right off the hosel,"A ""novel"" about fake golfers with fake nicknames losing fake money on a fake golf course just didn't seem funny to me. After reading ""Who's your Caddie"" which was a great book, this one was really a chunked chip shot."
4,Shanks for the fun!,Really fun to read. Reminds me of my fivesome. Could relate some of the nick names and pranks. Would make a great movie.
4,Shanks for Nothing,"A light and funny diversion for the avid golfer. Well-written and engaging, but you can put it down between rounds. I've bought three copies for the other guys in my foursome as Christmas gifts."
2,"Good camera, not as good as I hoped...","The auto focus feature doesn't always get into focus immediately. The video feature stinks, it is literally a series of photos being taken, and when played back on computer, it's so grainy it's hardly worth bothering with. Outside photos are fantastic, but, inside photos tend to be grainy. I'll be buying another brand the next time around. I do like having to use AA batteries, but have to replace often. Sheesh, I guess I like this camera a lot less than I thought! I think I'll go back to Kodak."
2,never again a Nikon,"Tried this camera because of the positive reviews at the time. It is an OK camera for carrying around, due to its' small size, and takes decent landscape pictures. However, its' macro ability is non-existent. That is one of the main reasons I buy a camera. My favorite cameras for that feature are Olympus, and I am about to buy a new one. I gave the Nikon 2 stars because it is compact and I carry it with me every day so I can leave my more valued cameras safe at home."
2,A Tiny Tank of the Digital Cameras,"I bought the Nikon Coolpix 7600 for Christmas and decided to return it. It takes pictures of very impressive quality and the buttons are straight forward and easy to use. BUT, there is a significant lag time when you take a photo with flash, at least 5 seconds. That does not seem like a lot but when you're trying to take pics fast, you don't have the 5-7 seconds. MOST IMPORTANTLY: it drains batteries like a tank drains its gas tank. It's unreal, I used brand new batteries and they wereDONE after 25 pictures. (Some other camera's batteries can last up to 400 pics). Anyway, it's a great camera but the engineers at Nikon haven't thought it through."
4,like the camera - don't like the battery burnage rate,The camera functions are great except that it uses AA batteries instead of the usual nickel ones. I have found they need to be replaced way too often.
1,Beware,"I gave this camera one star because it worked perfect until the store warranty ran out. Then the lens stuck (on this mint condition camera).I did a google search for ""coolpix lens stuck error"" and realized that I will have to buy a different brand. I would recommend searching Google before purchasing any Coolpix camera."
2,"Small, yes....light, yes....otherwise.....bad","I purchased this camera back in December. I am a professional photographer and was looking for a camera that I could carry all the time. This camera is small and light and easy to use, yes. But, the camera is so very slow and the focus is very touchy. By time the camera gets ready to shoot, you shot is gone. Forget the action shots, impossible. I am now looking to purchase the Sony cybershot and sell this one on Ebay."
4,great for the money,"This is my first digital camera. I am realatively pleased. The features to price ratio is great. In fact, Amazon's price beat most all competors, if you're shopping. I will agree with a previous reviewer, this is not a great one for action shots.. the delay throws me off. Or maybe there is a setting for action that I haven't gotten to; I'm certainly still learning. I've had pretty good luck with the photos that I've taken: mostly just macro-stills for website stuff. I can see that a larger screen might be more desirable. All in all, I wouldn't choose anything else."
3,Good but basic,You will find all the basic stuff to start with your iguana but it is definitely not the biggest book you can buy. Try the book : Green iguana-The ultimate owner's manuel.
2,Disappointed,"On some tracks, this CD has an annoying technical problem--occasional crackling sound distortion. (You may be able to hear it on sample track 1.) It's very disappointing, because the selection of hymns is good & he has a wonderful voice."
5,Wow,It's simply tremendous. This album ROCKS! Ini Kamoze is the best. Buy it right now. Highly recommended.
4,Good As a Review,"I have faced with this book in the Fall 2001 computer science course ""Data Structures and Algorithms"". As a novice to Java, I think this book does not cover enough introductory issues such as how importing of the libraries work, what are the installation instruction of JDK. They do not even give us any clue how to set up ann lib without using JBuilder. The documentation on the CD-ROM is for JBuilder users only. But overall book structure is very good."
3,Andre Rieu music,"I give this dvd a 7 out of 10. I have all of the Andre Rieu dvds and I donot think the song selection comprises the greatest hits. However, there are a few good versions of some of the best songs that make the dvd a valid addition to a musical collection."
5,Coffee and Tea......for friends and just for me...,I love this service for using when having the ladies over for tea or coffee. It's a conversation piece. I love the colour and style and it adds that extra touch when just having toast and coffee on my own.I highly recommend for others to purchase it!
5,love this book!,"Who knew what a florist cage was for? Or that you could make a fabulous centerpiece with a vase, some stickers and paper? An instant garden where there was none, whether in the middle of your lawn or the middle of your dining room table? These guys know how to do this and more, in a very fun and easy to follow format. All with a fun sense of humor. Run, don't walk to buy this book. I also hear they have kits you can buy with all you need to do one of the projects. I give this a big green thumb's up."
5,Best showerhead for low pressure,"I have a house in Mexico with a gravity-fed shower supplied by a tinaco on my roof. All the showerheads I tried before this one were so weak I could not get the shampoo out of my hair, or rinse stray hairs from my body while showering.X-STREAM TO THE RESCUE. Now I am in and out of the shower in minutes, and the pressure is amazing!I called Oxygenics and talked to the salesperson who warned me if your pressure is NOT low, because of its special design for ultra-low pressure, this showerhead will make the pressure lower, or even close the water off altogether.So be forewarned: this head is only for very low pressure water; if you have regular or normal pressure, buy a different Oxygenics product. That may be the problem other reviewers have had, as I cannot imagine a better showerhead than this for my gravity fed shower. It makes the spray every bit as good as in the shower in my house in the USA!"
3,Not Thrilled!,"I used this for about a week and then put the old showerhead back on. It's just like taking a hose and making the spray smaller to create more pressure. It seemed like a smaller stream of water with an attempt to massage. The massage feature does not work well and I can't seem to get it off of that setting no matter which way I turn it. To each their own, but this product wasn't for me.Overall, I don't feel that my pressure was intensified which is the purpose of this product. It gets 3 stars because it does function and it does look good, but doesn't function as described."
1,Don't buy this.,This thing is worthless. It actually reduces the pressure. Don't buy it if you have low pressure. A garden hose nozzle would work better.
4,Good summary of the noble system in the Imperium,"This supplement for GURPS Traveller covers the Imperial nobility, and the background for an interstellar fuedalistic govenment system. The book explains the historic basis for fuedalism, various systems of nobility that have existed in the Traveller timeline, and the current state of the Imperial system. The book is well written, adequately illustrated (SJG standard), and is a good overall description of what most players and GM's will need to incorporate nobles into their campaign worlds.Tantalisingly, some specific details of administration at the subsector level (some contraditcting previous Traveller material), missing bio's on the Empress Iolanthe and others, and more description of the Rule Of Man and Cleon's Campaign are not present. These are my only beefs with an otherwise good supplement."
5,"down to earth music, that just feels good",living in arizona i have not gotten a chance to hear these guys live but if they sound half as good live as they do in the studio i would be just as happy. these guys are for real and big things are on their way for them
1,Bad Printing of Good Book,Beware...the CreateSpace offering of Von Arnim's lovely story is a scanned version full of errors. (It is the one with a brown cover with several old texts piled on top of each other.) The binding is cheap and the large notebook size is not as convenient as a regular-sized paperback. I wanted to buy this book as a gift so I ordered the one printed by Cassia Press (it is the one with a white cover with purple flowers). The Cassia Press version is much nicer (and a little less expensive). I looked through it quickly before wrapping it and it appears to be a good printing.
3,Sit and sip,This is expressionist painting made into a book. So very pleasant and refreshing.To read leisurely.
4,A gem of a read,"Elizabeth And Her German Garden by Elizabeth von Arnim was such a delight. It was my company before bedtime for a few weeks and it was such a gentle, lovely read to send me to sleep. Von Arnim talks quite a bit about her gorgeous garden and her seemingly idyllic, pastoral life in her country house in Germany, of playing with her charming young daughters, bantering with her husband `Man of Wrath', entertaining a not-so-welcome house guest over the holidays. This book was such a gem of a read! The Solitary Summer is the companion to Elizabeth and her German Garden, and I can't wait to get started on that."
3,"Love the book, not the binding","The book is fabulous. This edition, however, is a cheapo one. The binding is not done well and looks cheap as does the print. Next time I'll spend the money on a better edition."
5,A Beautiful Record,"I agree with the other reviews on this page - this is truly hard one to discribe, which gives you all the more reason to check this out. I can't tell you one person who I've played this for who hasn't been blown away by it - No matter what your music tastes - it's creepy / sad / hopeful / uplifting / mysterious / I could go on and on. I'm very moved by this record - the more you listen the more you get sucked into it's twists and turns. Basically, a truly beautiful record."
4,unique and intoxicating,"i love this album. if you haven't heard samples, i think it sounds like elements of jazz and hip-hop. the music is very loose and full, often dreamy. everything follows the lead of the unique vocal lines and the beats. i highly recommend this album for lovers of all good music."
4,"Amazing, fresh CD...and they pull it off live!!!",Such a unique CD...loads of attitude and heart. Ms. Vincent's voice drives me crazy....in a good way. Very talented duo! Saw their show in LA last week in a funky Thai bar. Stunning performance by all...
3,Rarely capitalizes on potential,"The kind of arty post trip-hop scenarios which eagerly compels with bold ideas, crash-and-burns in artistic ambiguity, or more commonly dissipates into a hackneyed presentation between these two tugging forces of snobbish creativity."
4,Lots of compliments.,I have received lots of compliments and inquiries as to where I purchased this t-shirt. Lots of people really like the design. I was also impressed that the sizes were true and the material did not shrink after washing and drying.
4,Pretty darned cool,"At least 4 of the tracks on this album are superb and the others are at least OK. My favorites are Beyond Life, White Birds Sing, Fifty Million Years, A Tale of the Tribe.If you order this used it's well worth paying for the original artwork. This is probably the coolest CD cover I've ever seen - it's a series of holographic images of Leary."
4,Clever and funny.,Definitely enjoyed it. Very cleverly done with some very funny moments. Another great Wes Andersen flick; if you're a fan you won't want to miss it.
5,Grreat Movie,This is a great film :) it is funny and entertaining for both children and adults. I highly recommend giving this one a watch.
5,Great value,"Fun movie, and this package includes Blu-Ray, DVD, and also an iTunes digital license. Great value for the cost. Especially if you may not always have access to a Blu-Ray player."
3,Bleh,This isn't the worst movie in the world but I didn't feel engaged by the story telling or the characters. As a consequence I was bored through out the whole film and couldn't wait for it to be over. I also thought the character designs and animation were off putting- their facial expressions never seemed quite right and they all looked like they were put together by an amateur taxidermist. All and all- bleh.
3,Decent But Disappointing,"It was visually entertaining but nothing more. To me it was just action scene after action scene with no real rhyme or reason . Look, just because objects move fast on the screen for and hour and a half and gets your adrenaline pumping, doesn't mean it was a great movie. The movie also didn't have a heart to it. It felt emotionally cold. O.k. in a cartoon world we can argue that a fox doesn't show emotion because they are crafty, but there was something seriously lacking in this movie. There wasn't any real substance to it. I say it's slightly below average. Tom C."
2,Over-hyped,"This movie was way too over-hyped. It just isn't that good. The stop-motion animation is not charming; it's just jerky. If you like stop-motion, the Nightmare Before Christmas is a far better example of the genre. The plot, too, just wasn't that inspiring either.Save your money. If you're really curious, watch it on cable."
3,Good movie,"The movie was very fun to watch, but I had trouble getting the video to play. Luckily Amazon was nice enough to refund my rental fee for the troubles"
5,Great for children and adults,Wes Anderson is arguably one of the best directors on the scene today and this is arguably his finest films.
3,Fantastic Might Be an Overstatement,"This is pretty much exactly how I imagined a stop-motion Wes Anderson movie would turn out. The first two acts are really clever, warm and quirky, then the third drags on forever. Anderson brings along his usual cast of collaborators, who once again pull a miracle by feeling right at home in the new characters' skins, and the handful of new additions fit right in alongside them. George Clooney is perfectly cast as the slightly shady, endlessly charismatic lead, Willem Dafoe provides a great cameo and everyone's performances seem to key off of that shared energy. This was mostly charming and wholly entertaining as a goofball throwback to the old school of stop-motion animation that's sure to get better with repeat viewings."
3,"Good, But Not For Everybody",I thought this movie was very clever for the most part. However my family was just like whatever. It is A film for the animation enthusiast rather that all purpose like most Disney fare. I recommend this for animation fans but not for casual viewers.
1,disappointed,I was interested the forst 20 minutes or so but soon became bored and annoyed by this film so I was disappointed
1,Mindless,"My wife and I sat through it and at the end we asked ""what was all that about?"" We felt it was mindless nonsense, not even good comedy, and many of the scenes seemed unconnected."
1,Horrible movie.,"I had high hopes for this movie, as the ""experts"" gave it glowing reviews. Thank goodness I rented this from the library before buying it! This has to be one of the worst movies ever created. It was so boring I could not even make it through the first half of the movie. The characters are flat and unmemorable. The voices were uninterested and almost seemed bored themselves. There really is no plot or purpose to the movie. No wonder it did so poorly in the box office."
4,An instant classic!,"I recently saw this movie as a sneak preview and loved it. Couldn't wait to buy it. Went on vacation with my son and grandson and put in the movie when we had down time. My 28 year old and and his nephew [my grandson] were out laughing each other. And you know what, I forgot how funny and cute and smart this movie was. I loved the family dynamics and how the movie and storyline did not pull punches on responsibility, death, gluttony, and of course George Clooney [Mr. Fox]. Great purchase and something that we will watch over and over again. This is an instant classic which we will be watching again at Thanksgiving after dinner."
4,Fantastic adventure,"One of my favorite author's Roald Dahl has written books which not only appeal to children but adults as well. Books rarely get well adpated to the screen. In my opinion, this is a decent version and highly enjoyable for its animation.Mr. Fox is a smart fox but careless. During a raid on a chicken farm, they get caught in a trap and Mrs. Fox makes his promise that he should give up this life of crime should they come out alive and also that she is pregnant. A couple of years go by and Mr. Fox has been domesticated and looking to upgrade in to better house. They buy this house in a tree and it is near the farms of Boggis, Bunce and Bean, three of the richest and meanest poultry farmers in the country. Mr. Fox is suddenly tempted and plans a heist with a opussum, Kylie and his own nephew. Once he is successful he raids the farm on a regular basis, the farmers upset band together and decide to get rid of the fox altogether. I loved this movie 4 stars 6/19/10"
4,I love this film,I love watching fox family when they fight whom they they put restrictions on them.. fox family fight so clevery and make clever plans and at lsst they can get everything they need.. All the characters played their best
4,The Fantastic (first half at least) Mr. Fox,"The first half is fresh and fun, full of unexpected characterizations that would never be caught dead (like a chicken) in a Disney film. The second half devolves into numerous Disney-esque plot contrivances, none of which I will go into because they might be spoilers to some. I just wish the story would have finished with the same energy with which it began instead of falling flat. I loved everything else about this film. A solid four stars that could have (and should have) been five."
5,Fantastic,"An excellent movie. The animation is amazing and imbues the ""characters"" with strong personalities. The quality of the voice acting adds to this, thus making the characters live and breath in a manner that exceeds many ""live action"" movies. The story is strong, the dialogue witty and touching,and this is an all around good film."
2,Not Much There There,"This animated film, which features Armageddon between a fox who just cannot get thievery out of his system and three wealthy, but deranged, local farmers, gets points for its original style and a few good laughs, but no more. In the end, it is just another relatively mindless action spectacle--a very sophisticated Bugs Bunny or Roadrunner cartoon. Stack it up against a ""Wall-E"" or a ""Secret of NIMH"" and its fundamental hollowness becomes evident. Unfortunate use of a very high-powered cast."
2,Disappointing to our family.,"The animation here is quirky and the story is ok. But if our family's reaction (ages 57, 55, 34, 28 and almost 4) is any guide, this one's not worth buying. I don't think we will ever watch it again. It certainly failed our toddler's critical review. She announced, as it was ending, ""I don't like it."" This from a child who, if she likes a film, asks to see it over and over again. She loves Horton (Hears a Who), Up, Kung Fu Panda, and the Bizard (Wizard) of Oz. She will sit through long films from beginning to end. But this one she needed some minor cohersion to get through."
2,odd movie,"I can understand why the movie was not a box office success. A lot of hype is given to the technology that created the movie - which is considerable. However, the movie itself was not good. It really didn't appeal to children or adults - maybe teens would like it."
3,Dissapointed,"The dialogue and situations are not oriented toward children, perhaps preadolescents will find it more appealing. As an adult, I did not find the story cogent. The artwork is great, but the story is only loosely based on the book by Roald Dahl, and suffers greatly because of it. My 5 year old daughter and eight year old son had trouble paying attention throughout the movie."
3,Rainy Days and Sundays,"Those are the days you might need a snoozer such as this one.Wily Mr. Fox is more like the Beaver's dad than he is anything else. The stop action is good for anyone who might have been in a coma since the release of ""The Seven Voyages of Sinbad"", but not much for anyone who can recognize a scene from Star Wars.Crank your expectations back to the fourth grade and it's a fine movie."
2,My daughter and I weren't impressed,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter thinking she would love it and it would keep her interested. Boy was I wrong....the movie did not hold her attention for even 10 minutes. I tried to watch it as well and found myself not content as well. I would recommend to rent this first if you buying it for your children to see how they react first.
2,Are you kidding me,"I guess I' am to old for this movie. The stop motion animation was good, but my son and I thought the movie absolutely SUCKED. Although my 8 year old granddaughter liked it. I'd suggest a rental before buying it."
5,one of my favorites,"I saw this movie several times in the theater and finally bought myself a copy. You won't be disappointed. Stop action!! It's nice to see a movie not full of CGI, and all of the actors who did the voices were super-dee-duper."
5,I love this movie.,Such a great movie. Jason is hilarious in this movie and Clooney is also hilarious. Great movie that can be watched by any age group and everyone will enjoy it! Great animation and a fun plot that is filled with funny comments.
5,Fantastic Film,"This is one my son's favorite films. He watched this DVD as much as 20 times in the first week after I bought it! So needless to say, the product was delivered as promised, in super condition. Very entertaining and enjoyable for the whole family!"
5,Fun and clever!,Loved this movie. It's fast paced and fun! George Clooney is terrific as Mr. Fox. The rules for Whack Bat are hilarious. Adults and kids will enjoy watching this movie.
5,Fantastic,"Outstanding animated film; the script and the actor's dialog is superb. George Clooney, Meryl Streep and the rest of the cast are first rate. Great film for children and adults."
5,A VERY CUSS FUNNY CUSS MOVIE!,"The Fantastic Mr. Fox isn't a roll of the floor funny type film, but it is one of the funniest films I've seen all year. The film moves along at a quick pace and while no one joke blows you away that fact the it remains funny from start to finish is an achievement that is seldom, well.....achieved!The animation is quirky almost trippy, kind of like Robot Chicken and Adult Swim type stuff. The voice acting is also strong with Clooney, Murray and company giving the furry characters life. I may not have laughed so hard my stomach ached, but I had a smile on my face from start to finish and that doesn't happen often enough. The DVD transfer looks great, but the extras are pretty bland."
4,"Charming, quirky, clever","Charming, quirky, clever - everything you'd expect from a GOOD Wes Anderson movie. The animation is endearingly retro stop motion, but the detail shows the depth of care and thought that went into this film."
5,Great Movie,"As you watch the movie, you actually sympathize with the ""thieves"" - Fox and his friends. Very good and very entertaining."
3,"Mediocre, at best. Definitely for teens and above.","I was so disappointed I cursed the $$$ spent buying it. I'll donate it to the local library, as it's not worth keeping in mine. There was no real plot, and the animation was ""stiff"". Again, save your money, and time, it's not what one had hoped for."
1,I Just Wish They Hadn't,"I couldn't even watch the whole movie because it was so disappointing. Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my favorite childhood books, and as is often the case it's hard to separate the book from the movie. The book is short, whimsical, and, quite simply, fantastic. To make a movie they had to add so much stuff that they should have just called it something else. I might have enjoyed the movie if I hadn't read the book so many times.The biggest disappointment is that since Roald Dahl grew up in Wales and England, in my head the characters always had British accents. The way he writes is definitely English, not American. The voices (and dialogue) in this movie are awful!"
2,I also had a 'what the' look while watching this,"I'm sorry, I thought this was awful. I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it was great.The stop motion looked bad, although I couldn't tell if that was the intention of the animators or not. Even though I had read the book, I just couldn't find interest in the plotline. I had to constantly turn up the television volume because the voices were so low and quiet.I couldn't stand the animal characters and was cheering for the farmers about halfway through it. This movie was not a delight, and a bit disturbing."
1,Horrific butchering of a fantastic story,"While I realize movies-based-on-books often only loosely follow the book, this waste of 1.5 hours neither remotely sticks to the original characters or plot created by Roald Dahl nor even attempts to capture any of his whimsical adventurous flair. The Book/movie is titled 'THE FANTASTIC MR. FOX' which is a catch phrase of sorts in the book but I did not catch once in the movie. The movie heads in a whole different direction for plot, the characters are not even slightly as portrayed in the book....very disappointed, don't waste your time!"
2,Not satisfied,"I bought this movie to show to a group of kids for a Parent's Night Out event at church.I had my 9 year old son preview it for me and when he told me I probably shouldn't show itI thought I better watch it. He was right. They say cuss a lot and a movie about a lying, stealing foxwould not have been a good choice to show to a group of young church kids. Had to go a different routefor the evening movie."
1,surprised.,I have waited so long to get this from the library so I could enjoy a highly rated animation. My husband was asleep in no time and I picked up a book to read after about 45 mins. I did not like that the colors of the clothes and setting were all about the same shade. I did not think the characters were interesting. I kept waiting for a reason to care about a restless fox that wants to hunt chickens. We gave up and shut it off. I am so glad I did not buy this one.
1,A Study in Idiocy,"This was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. I am now convinced that movie reviewers are on the film maker's payrolls, at least in this case. I couldn't even finish the movie. Please save your money and buy another movie."
5,Completely awesome if you like Wes Anderson,"It is typical Wes Anderson (Royal Tannenbaums, Life Aquatic, Rushmore, etc) . We love his style - albeit unoriginal. The actors are not bored - the technique is called ""deadpan"" which is freaking hilarious if you have half a sense of humor. Clooney and Streep are amazing at this.... The kids are entertaining, funny and dark. Both of my children -2.5 and 5.5- watched this at least 5 times the first weekend we got it. The stop action is just as classic and rough as it should be - little nuances in the fur, the choppiness - perfect. this is art and if people don't like it, well, their loss. Their opinions speak for their understanding of this art form."
5,Fantastic!!!,This movie kinda grew on me after watching it a few times. A little weird but in a cute funny way! I went to my local video store and they didn't have it stock and had to special order it for me which took too long. I ordered it on Amazon for 9.99 (BLUE RAY) and received in less than the time I was contacted by the local store. Not to mention they wanted to charge me x3 times the amount!!! Thanks Amazon ;)
4,What the cuss is up? Great Show,"My family LOVES this movie, and quote it all the time. I'm not the greatest fan, but got it for my kids' enjoyment. The stop motion process is AMAZING, however, and it is very clever."
1,I could not believe how bad this book was!,"This is the first Brenda Joyce book that I have read, and if this typical of her writing style it will also be the last. When I read the backcover description of the story it sounded like something I would really enjoy - I could not have been more mistaken. The plot had promise, but the writing was awful. The book was full of mistakes and contradictions. The ""witty banter"" between Claire and Ian was supposed to make Claire seem charming (I think), but instead made her seem moronic. The fact that all Claire had to do to distract Ian from his intended plan was flash him a huge smile made him seem like a complete pushover. What a waste of time!"
2,Tedious Claire,"I too wondered who would bother to be around Claire, as detective. She was tediously strident and annoying. There just wasn't enough romance building time between she and Ian and it wasn't believable that he could fall for her given her behavior. I felt it was a waste of money and am mad at myself for buying it."
3,"An ""alright"" book.","I really enjoyed the WWII story of Eddie and Rachel. And, I found the final villian fairly surprising.But I didn't see much chemistry between Claire & Ian. It was as if their romance was thrown in there just ""because"". And, riddle me this: Why is it that the ""hero"" can deceive, use and manipulate the heroine and she ends up feeling she was foolish to call him on it AND ends up begging for HIS forgiveness? Talk about misplaced guilt!"
3,Just ok really...,"The storyline was great and pretty unique...but the delivery left a lot to be desired. I'm not sure if The Chase was one of Joyce's first works or one that was just a bit ""off"" but it sure didn't read like her normally flawless style...The past tense writing read well, but when the characters were in present conversation mode it was just very awkward. And another thing that bothered me was that she explained the same scenario over and over and over again...it's like give me a break already, I get it! I mean I'm smart enough to buy your book right?! I've never noticed her doing that in her books before so I don't know what happened...And yet again if this is your first Brenda Joyce book don't start out with this one. Instead try...""Splendor""""The Finer Things""""The Third Heiress"" orThe Masters of Time Series"
4,Melting Pot,"The Boo Radleys'tendency to be all over the place is clearly both a curse and a blessing.In any of their albums we are bombarded by 2,3songs that never really take off,experiments gone awry;but when they get their mix just right it's a joy watching all those elements gel together in an unexpected,yet trully original way.""C'mon Kids""is their most dense,heavy and arguably best effort.It's not as accessible as ""Wake Up!""since it's much more complex,quite simply the hooks instead of being blatant and obvious are lurking beneath guitar fuzz or some other cool trickery.Even if their combination of Beach Boys/Big Star melodies with punk energy,Julian Cope-styled embelishments and just about anything that comes around looking good isn't always focused or song-structure respecting you can't condemn Martin Carr for trying to be original."
1,Wouldn't even go together - wrong parts.,Horrible quality control - the base and tube would not slide together. What a disappointment - now I have to box it up to ship it back. What a hassle...
5,"If you like ginger, its hard to stop at just one.","I love ginger and these are probably the best cookies out there for my taste (gluten-free or otherwise). The texture is soft bake (they aren't snaps, after all), and there are pieces of crystalized ginger that give little ginger boosts/crunch as you eat the cookie. Warning: its hard to stop at just one."
2,Too Many Ads; Too Little Oahu,"Oahu itself is a wonderful place to visit, but this dvd seemed more intent on showcasing nightclubs, stores, restaurants, and hotels than the land and the sea. Just driving the coastal road is fantastic, with many scenic spots (all beaches in Oahu are open to the public), but I don't recall it being mentioned on the dvd. Oahu is much better than its stores and clubs!!! And true Hawaiian music is lovely... there wasn't much of it on the dvd."
3,A history lesson,"There are some great things in this dvd, but it is more geared toward a history lesson. I bought this trying to find out about all the things to do on the island so I can plan my trip and was disappointed. There are some short clips of the beaches and then a lot of attention is given to night clubs which I have no interest in. There's also some time dedicated to surfing the North Shore."
3,Overall OK,"I wouldn't say this is an outstanding piece of software but if you have some skills and some patience you can make it work for you. I think I paid 10 bucks for the software and the cable. I wouldn't shell out more than $20 for the setup. It is worth that price just for the cable and a shot at seeing if the software will work for you. I was able to syncronize outlook contacts and calendar with my V3 RAZR and I was able to download pictures off my phone, my two main objectives. That alone was worth the money. I downloaded the updates as well, and recommend doing it. I found out that if you set everything you want up in Outlook, erase the phone's phonebook (an option in the software before you synchronize), and then syncronize, it works best. You will lose your voicedials, but you just go back and redo them in your phone afterwards. My only issue is getting the software to communicate with the phone but once it does, you can get it to do what you want it to do."
1,a no go,I read all the reviews and decided that for the price that this product was being sold I would risk it.It is a really odd product. It will recognize my phone and upload all of my phone and calendar details but when I try to use it to input information it all of a sudden gives me this 'failed to connect with mobile' message.I am really disappointed with the difficulty this 'convenient' software has caused me.
1,Does not work with Razr V3,"Did two complete installs and neither was successful. It knows a phone was plugged in but never connects. So, I bought a nice cable. Does not rate any stars."
2,USB Cable plus software,Theres problems using Moto..phone tools with verwireless. The cable works fine with my razor but the software and getting the computer to detect the phone is a hassle and I had to get help on the net.
3,Gordon,"Product did not provide the advertised functions because my cell phone service is Verizon which does not allow transferring music, video and text to the phone. This limitation was not apparent from the product description. Since I only paid about $10.00 including shipping, I was not totally disappointed."
4,Works with K RAZR,"You have to download an update, but this does work with the latest RAZR phones.Only problem so far is that the oldest schedule date is 1980, so birthdays and anniversaries before 1980 do not correctly sync."
2,Stay away: MOTOROLA Mobile Office Tools for Motorola RAZR3,"This software is just AWFUL. It tries to do too much in one package. The install was horrible. It took me 10 or more emails, back and forth with the vendor, over a period of about 2 weeks to get this thing up and running. The install is confusing, for example asking for the model number of your phone, in a lull-down list... and my model (it's brand new) isn't even listed. It required an on-line update, so it won't work on non-networked computers. The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome. This software is good for nerds, perhaps, but not for the faint of heart. And this vendor does not give refunds. I know because I asked. The vendor did help, but it took a long time to get this thing installed."
3,Cheap way to get a USB cable,I purchased this item primarily because I needed a USB-to-miniUSB cable and the bundle was cheaper than the cable purchased separately (even from Amazon). I've never used the software disk and may not need to since this device is supported on the Mac by the iSync utility.
2,Think about it twice.,"The case looks pretty good in the picture, but it looks like a second hand product when you have it in front of you. It takes away the cellphone's pretty looks."
1,Useless for Mac users,Nowhere in the product description does it mention that this software is for PC's only. I feel like I was mislead.
3,4.0 Phonetools,The software is OK. Not quite what I'd hoped for. But I don't think I can complain. Certainly the price was right!
2,Skip it,"Not only did this software not work, it would barely install properly! It wouldn't interface with my phone, even after calling my carrier.Thankfully it was cheap, so I don't feel bad wasting a few bucks."
1,4.0 Phonetools CD,WE have a RAZR V3m and this does not work with it. We have downloaded all the updates available and it will not work with our phone. Very disappointing. It looks like a great product if it would work for the RAZR V3m.
3,"Works ok, not too great for L2","This product worked really well, but it is really just good for an initial setup. Now that most phones have bluetooth along with computers that do, you can easily manage your files on your phone. It is good for managing your contacts positions."
4,Very intellectual,"During my freshman year of college, my writing class required us to write a research paper, and in typical style I was disappointed because everyone in my class was writing about abortion or sports, and when I saw this book at the the University library, I got very excited because it appeared that there were actual scholars writing about Batman and it presented me the opportunity to research his history. This book, in conjunction with a few others, allowed me to prove my thesis at a well-known Big Ten university (not that it was that hard) that Batman's evolution was a direct result of society's changing political and social views"
5,Helps fibromyalgia and restless leg,"I suffered from fibromyalgia pain and muscle cramping as well as restless leg. This product helped immensely - it cut down my near constant leg and arm pain and pretty much killed the restless leg in its entirety. I can't overstate the change magnesium has brought to my quality of life. Fibro still is always here, but the pain is dialed down big time. The combo of this and Lidocaine (prescription) patches allow me to work full time."
1,Worthless - Contains Calcium Carbonate,"I was surfing amazon, searching out a more biovailable form of magnesium than the oxide form, and went with this because it was cheap. Well, you get what you pay for. Calcium and magnesium are antagonists, canceling each other out in the body. Oh well, at least I'm getting some malic acid."
3,No stomach upset,"I like this product because it doesn't upset my stomach like magnesium citrate does. Although, if you read the fine print, there is much less actual magnesium in each pill compared to magnesium citrate."
2,works ok,"This light is nice because it is small and light weight. It gives off enough light to get you noticed by other cars on the road. It's not intended to light your path.What I don't like about this light is the strap. It is somewhat difficult to attach to your bike. If it isn't on just right, the light will fall off and there is no alternate way to attach it."
4,Great light,This light is very cool. It is small and compact. The 3 leds give off good light. Don't count on it to light up the road but it will certainly keep you safe and get you home.
2,"ok light, fell apart in one week","I'm not an intense cyclist- commuter bicyclist. The light worked well, but after one week of use, the guts flew out of the case when I hit a not so big bump on a paved street. I was able to find only one battery the next morning, so can't verify quality of design, but it should have been able to resist a relatively minor jolt without falling apart."
4,Bike Light,"I bought this light after trying our several different lights for my bike. This one is very compact and doesn't take up much room, it's easy to put on and take off and works well as a headlight or as a flasher. Battery life is great , esp compared to the halogen lights that take C cell batteries. The only drawback is that the on/off button is very hard to press...maybe the one I got is the exception, I would still buy another one."
4,"Great for city safety, but one flaw...","A handy light that's easy to snap on/snap off. In my theft-prone city, I like being able to slip this in a pocket when I lock up. The light is bright and when blinking is unmissable, so for safety it's great. For headlight illumination...no. The only drawback for me is the rubber strap, which too easily detaches. You can't get that part separately so if you lose it you must replace the unit. But hey, it's cheap. I like it."
1,This Light is a Bomb,"I mean that literally. I live in an older part of town, some of the streets are pretty rough, uneven, bumpy, potholes, etc.. First day I used this light I ran over a rough patch in the road and the light just blew apart. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't stop to try to gather all the pieces. In praise of Amazon I returned the parts I had left and Amazon refunded my money. Do yourself a favor and spend about $5 more. I now use a Planetbike beamer3, read the reviews about this light. Everything they wright about how good it is are true.Planet Bike Beamer 3 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mount"
2,fine but one led stop working after a few months,"It's easy to put on and pull off (although sometimes TOO easy to pull off--it can come off if you brush against it). It will get you seen. My main complaint is that one of the led's soon stopped working and now its even less effective. If I could redo it, I would just buy a more powerful model."
2,Misleading title,"While a perfectly fine introduction to vegetables, there is precious little information about the Victory Gardens in/of World War II. The illustrations of children dressed in mid 90s or later garb also negates the World War II-era/Victory Garden concept."
3,Good for the money,"These are nice clamps for the money. They hold well and don't slip once they're locked into place.Like the other reviewer mentioned, the plastic ends probably wouldn't hold up to years of pro use, but they'll work for my needs.My only complaint is that the clamping surface (the part that the red rubber pads are on) could be longer. I've found myself using some of my older clamps for situations where I need more reach.Otherwise, they work well considering the price."
4,Great Start,"This is the first in a long running series featuring Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James. The Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent, Kincaid, takes advantage of his cousin's time share in Yorkshire. Unfortunately, there is a murder, then another and then there are attacks on other guests. Kincaid must get involved much to the dismany of the local police. This was an interesting start to a series and I can't wait to read more."
4,Addictive,"Another series my sister recommended to me. Love the characters and settings not to mention the plots. I've read 14 so far and not gotten tired of or bored with any. Yes, some are better than others but I found all worth reading. Duncan, Gemma, Toby and Kit almost feel like my relatives. Since I'll never get to England by any other means, reading British mysteries fulfills my yearning. This series takes me there and doesn't disappoint."
4,First book in a great series,"Reading this series has been a pleasure. The main characters, detectives Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James, are so likable and Deborah Crombie creates that perfect balance in a mystery -- keeps you on the edge of your chair but without all the excessive violence and gore that seems so prevalent in crime fiction today. Would recommend this book for a rainy weekend or a beach vacation!"
3,A Good First Detective Story,"Crombie's first book in the now 13-book series of detective stories is a very worthwhile work, altho missing the detailed character, situation, and plot-complexity achieved in her later books, each of which builds on the character development of detectives Kincaid & James, and their growing personal relationship. Their current jacket-blurbs describe Crombie as successor to P.D. James, Ruth Rendell or Martha Grimes -- a level not quite attained, yet, but one which in time she may very well achieve. If you're interested in thoughtful interesting British mysteries, try her books -- they get better & better, and they're definitely a treat."
2,Too dull and sanitized,"I was expecting a dark and moody, fast paced police procedural with twists and turns galore. I was wishing for flawed and multi-layered heroes and villains to feel strongly about. Unfortunately, I found the story dull as dishwater and the characters so boring and sanitized I felt no affinity toward any of them. By the end of the book I really didn't care whodunit, I just wanted to finish the book and get it over with. Det. Sup. Duncan Kincaid was lovely and sweet, but not for me. Give me a character like Harry Hole or Anna Travis any day."
3,A Share in Death,Not very thought provoking.Initials used that unless you are British you would not know what they meant.
3,May Be A Promising Start.,"This may be a promising start to a new series, but I found this book quite simplistic (written at about Grade 4 level,) and the coincidences were a bit too much! Kinkaid appears to be a lame duck since he seems to yearn romantically about both women his age that he meets during the course of solving the murder. Also, I knew that it was an American author writing an English procedural (a la Elizabeth George and Martha Grimes who do it so skilfully), but I found that the story did not sound English and the characters did not sound and act like the English do. It didn't ring true. I will attempt to read another book in the series to see if it gets better. I was looking forward to beginning this series after I had read some of the reviews, so I am disappointed."
2,Foils for love,"What did George Sand do to make her name famous? What did one of her lovers Alfred de Musset do? Look it up on the internet. You won't find the answer in this film which focuses solely on the turbulence of their affair.What other kind of affair would you expect from two French artistes? They had more libido than self discipline. More pretensions than intelligence. So their unpromising affair went thru its inevitable ups and downs and mighty upheavals -- accompanied by suitably heavy handed background music.If you don't like hopeless, dueling foils for love, try another DVD."
2,Not what I hoped for,"Despite the fact that the history has some errors, it could have won me over with some sort of depth but I got so tired of watching all the melodrama and shallow emotion that it all became predidctable and there was not a lot of depth to any of the characters. Binoche was not at her best and I thought it would never end. When you really dont care what happens to the main characters you dont have a winner."
2,Banal Binoche extravaganza,"This film began as a beautiful European historical period piece, in Paris, which lush costumes, gorgeous people, etc. But after an hour, it deteriorated into incredibly boring melodrama with Binoche placed in alternating picturesque European cities and sex scenes. No deep emotions are penetrated, more than many other Binoche vehicles like ""Chocolat"" and ""The Horseman on the Roof"". I couldn't wait for it to end -- it's 2 hours seemed like 4."
1,Joe's Review,"This book was a very different book. I thought it was kind of odd, and it was full of poems that had nothing to do with the rest of the book. I, being an action/fantasy reader myself, thought that this book was a little bit of boring. I really do not recommend this book . I give it a 1 out of 10."
4,Locomotion,Locomotion is a book about an eleven year old boy and his life. The boys name is Lonnie Collins Motion. His parents died when he was 7 years old in a fire and him and his sister are in two different homes but not to far from each other. The whole book is poems in a notebook his teacher gave to him. He visits his sister every once in a while and just knows her foster mom doesn't want a boy to live with her. There are many things that go on in his life and he deals with it by writing it in a poem.
3,(...),This was a really good book.It really didn't have any plot. Lonnie got his nickname Locomotion from the song Locomotion. His mother would dance to the song. Then he dance along. I reccomend this book to poem readers. It is the kinda book that you would want to read. Believe me. If you like a book were it keeps you wondering and you just can't put it down. THIS IS IT!
2,Locomotion,Locomotion is an interesting book because I think it better suits poem readers not book readers if you are looking for a strong plot I do not recommend this book for you. I had trouble staying with the book because there was no plot that I could recognize .So once again I recommend it to poem readers.
2,"Locomotion, An Okay Book","This book, Locomotion, was an okay book. I think that in some ways it was good and in some ways bad. The book should have been called a collection of poems rather than a book. The poems did not fit like a story well because they never reached a climax. I think that this book would suit someone who wanted to learn that poetry does not need to rhyme and that they can be very freeform. Woodson has a gift for writing poetry, but not for creating a plot. I would not recommend this book to someone looking for a great book, but for a quick read. I thought that the book did not satisfy me but still deserves a decent rating. It was interesting to discuss at times but sometimes the poems lacked deeper meaning. All in all, the book was good but not a book that I would highly recommend."
3,Thorough and Dense,"The scope of Economics of Property-Casualty Insurance rests on the title phrase. Buy this book if you need a direct definition of causes, consequences, and external variables regarding actuarial mathematical conclusions. Do not buy this book if you need a brief and general overview about ""the math that actuaries use to rate stuff."" In addition, the passive voice and run-on sentences may lose you in a string of thoughts. However, if you understand the P-C Industry very well, you'll probably follow the process just fine."
1,What a ripoff!,"This book is not worth it's $10.99. If shipping wasn't so expensive to return this book, I would have returned this book right away. There is nothing Mary-Kate and Ashley related except for the picture on the cover. This is very sleazy advertising, and what is worst is that it is ripping off younger fans. Aside from the nice cover, the inside is made of very regular cheap black and white wording and the editing style was very cheap also. I can buy other craft books that are cheaper and way better. Even the ribbons and glitter that comes with this book doesn't add up to its value. As a long time fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, I am very disappointed with this product. Only their name is being used to sell the product, but the product does not have anything to do with them."
1,The Worst Olsen Twins ever published,"NNNNNNOOOOOOO! Please do NOT buy this book. This is just ... awast of paper. This book has nothing of the Olsens and It is a craft book over price and made of [poor quality] paper with MKA's name on it so younger fans spend there hard earned money on this. Also, I mean, when you make it,its really fun.But think of it,after you finsh making it, theres nothing left.And I shopped at amazon.com and I think this is the most dissapointing book I have bought so far."
4,Pretty Good. But............,But it doesn't have to many things having to do with the twins. It is a great little book for making your own Valentine cards but it has nothing to do with Mary-Kate and Ashley. I thought there would pictures of them on the cards themselves and a little saying that has to do with Valentine and/or twins. Its great but it kind of leaves the twins out of the book except the cover. It comes with great art materials. If it had the twins in it more than this would be worth 5 stars.
3,Defact parts,"The deliver service was great, but the battery is not able to charge. I need to call supplier for return"
1,Good customer service - bad product,"The battery does not charge. Eforcity replaced it immediately, but the replacement also does not function. I gave up requesting a third battery."
2,Good and Bad Scanner,"Good? It is very fast. It scans about 45 pages a minute.Bad? 1. When you push the button to scan, it can take up to a minute to start the scanning process. Total headache.2. It jams somewhat frequently."
1,"Poor Reliability, Lots of Jambs","I purchased this scanner several years ago. I typically only scan several pages at a time. The machine continually jambs, I spend more time clearing, resetting the scanner than actually scanning the documents. For every one-page that it scans one-page jambs. It is very frustrating for a scanner that cost over $700 when I purchased it. At this price point, it should function much smoother. Now one side of the double-sided scanner is leaving black streaks.Positive point is the software interface and suite of software that came with the unit."
3,"Learn how successful women do it, and how you can too!","WOMEN TO WOMEN offers a look a how to improve MANY areas of your life through interviews with successful women. There are lots of practical tips in the book on everything from Yoga practice to Money Management. The successful women featured in the book all offer realistic advice as they share their own stories of how they ""made it"". Most of them also admit that they are still working on their lives, and striving to improve. That's a nice touch for readers who might otherwise feel that women like these can't relate to those of us who are still struggling to find ANY kind of success. The best part of the book is that it offers such varied topics --somewhere in its pages readers are sure to find advice that is personally meaningful."
5,"I RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA, BUT....","i am just upset with the play on words manufactures use to sell there products. like the words ""capable"" and ""compatible"" they use for hdtv'sok, the line used for this camera. (Super NightShot Infrared System With Sony's NightShot Infrared System you can capture natural looking video, even when shooting in low light. Record subjects up to 20 feet away using the built-in infrared system.)NATURAL the key word, i thought that sony came out with a new technology eliminating the green hue shown in infrared, i even called sony to confirm before i bought this camera. the sales person even asked his supervisor to answer my question. (IM ASSUMING ""NATURAL"" MEANS IN FULL COLOR RIGHT. HE assured me yes it does mean full COLOR....IT DOES'NT.I still love this camera and recommend. i have 5 other sony video camera's with the fx1 being one of them, which has the best quality in a hd format that i have seen."
1,Do Not Buy this product if you are on a MAC!,"5 months later the software to use this product as HD on a mac has not been released. In the meantime the camera price has gone down $500. Even so, there are better cameras for much less money that are compatible with Macs. I wish people would remove their outdated reviews of products. They lead people to buy VERY EXPENSIVE products that are not worthy of the investment."
4,Excellent!,"I haven't had the camcorder long enough to give a good review, but from using it for only 3 weeks, I like it very much. I have had a little trouble with focusing. It is probably something I am not doing correctly, but when panning, it doesnt focus quickly enough for me.I have found the Black Magic Infinity HDMI card and have one on order. I hope it will allow me to import and edit the footage and output into the format I choose."
2,Sony HD doesn't work with Apple software,"We thought this camera was going to be great as it is one of the most recently introduced HD video cameras. Unfortunately, Sony and Apple don't seem to be working together yet, and as we use Apple computers and editing software, this camera was of no use to us. To Amazon's credit, they took the camera back and covered the shipping costs in both directions because of this. We hope Sony and Apple get it together soon!"
4,"Love it, But Haven't Use That Much Yet.","I haven't used this camcorder that much yet. But I want to post this to let everyone know that ""Pinnacle Studio(tm) Ultimate"" is about to be released and will support AVCHD. I just got an e-mail for presell at $69.99."
2,"Not Mac compatible, poor software, good hardware","I purchased this camcorder last week and have confirmed with Sony that it is absolutely not Mac compatible. Sony's software is Windows-only and their proprietary AVCHD format is not supported by anyone other than Sony (so far) it seems. There is not any software I could find for the Mac that works with the camcorder. Perhaps this will change with time.The software that Sony provides is pretty bad and in fact, I have not gotten the video playback to work cleanly. The user interface is clunky and not intuitive.The hardware (i.e .the camcorder itself) seems pretty solid and usable but I'm very disappointed in the rest. I'm sending mine back."
4,Best camcorder on the market,I did a lot of research and currently this is the best HiDef camcorder on the market. I'm just waiting for the price to go back to thirteen hundred dollars and I'm set! :)
3,"Beautiful, but seriously flawed.","Amazing picture, amazing sound, intuitive and easy UI navigation -- NO one will disagree with any of that. But what can you do with the footage? As of right now, not much.As a Mac user my only option is to only use standard definition mode (1/4 the resolution) and then use conversion tools, but did I pay this much for SD quality?? I hope not.AVCHD looks very promising, but until editing tools come out, all of my HD videos will be suck on the camera. Adobe among other have expressed support for the format, but I don't want to purchase a $1,000+ software to get my videos off either.I installed the software CD on a Windows machine, and am completely underwhelmed. In a review on CNET they say don't even bother installing it. I definitely agree, but what other option do I have?Bottom line - amazing picture and sound, even in low-light. But other than hooking the camera up to a TV, sharing your videos is not what it should be."
3,Great Product/HD for PC only,"Don't buy this if you want HD on a Mac (as of early Feb 07). There is still no support for it. Check out the Sony site first to see if support has been added. You can use it with a Mac and SD, with a few addons, but really, who would buy this for SD? Other than that it's wonderful. Very easy to learn and use. Quality is very high. I bought it even though I'm Mac only at this point."
2,Sony Charges you for Poor Quality,"The camera broke after the first few months of ownership. Electronics have flaws, I understand. What added insult to injury was Sony billed me $161.48 to fix their defect in the camera. Further, I had to ship it to them on my dime! I think I'm spoiled with my iPod. When that broke Apple paid the bill and corrected the issue promptly.Besides the poor quality the camera is great. I'm sure another brand will give the same functionality with better quality."
5,Best Purchase Made in Long Time!,"This camera has more than exceeded my expectations.Why this camera works for me plain and simple:1) the video quality is amazing (even the SD is really sharp). Simply shoot SD if you need to edit on a mac until FCP or FCE is updated to handle AVCHD.2) the convenience of having a hard disk drive camcorder is worth the price alone (no tape! it's essentially a computer)3) the mic is extremely crisp but you also have the added bonus of a stereo mic-in4) And finally, the most intuitive digital interface and user-friendly functionality I have ever seen on a camera or camcorder.I give this camera 5 stars hands down."
5,Sony HDR-SR1,Great product came with quick delivery. Solid transaction all around. This filled my need quite well. I will purchase more products from this seller in the future.Great quality for a great price. Best on the market in its range for sure
4,Un libro bien organizado y de mucha ayuda.,"Para los que están comenzando a programar páginas de Internet este libro ofrece una valiosa información. No es un libro para aprender a programar sino para diseñar y poner a funcionar una página de internet efectivamente. Su contenido está orientado hacia los productos de Microsoft, desde programas hasta ayuda para servidores de internet.A very well written beginners site builders book. Informative and Microsoft products oriented, from software to site servers support."
4,Wonderfully intriguing book . . .,"This book was difficult to put down. Of all of the books I've read regarding the subject of reincarnation, I found this one to be the most interesting. Most of the time, when a book is written about the after-life, it's someone who has had a near-death experience. The aurthor of this book was experiencing this ""astral plane"" of the after-life while he was dreaming, and found comfort after he contacted his beloved brother who had passed on. Many a person may scoff at the notion, and think this is a good piece of entertaining fiction. If so, so be it. However, if you have more of an open mind, it makes you think . . ."
4,A soul's journey,I received the book in good condition and was happy at the price I paid. The problem for me was TextbooksRus.com does not send their book overseas. I had to send to a friend in US and then wait until they posted it on to me. It cost on $10.25 US It would be so much better if these book could be sent world wide as Amazon does.
5,My Favorite book EVER!,"This has been my favorite book since I first read it in 1990. Since then, I have read it over and over many times, but the first time, I read it in ONE day because I just couldn't put it down.I think everyone should read this book, it gives you another perspective of life after death, and about dreams.I read somewhere that this book inspired much of the scenery in the movie ""What Dreams May Come"" with Robin Williams. Especially the COLORS in that movie because this book says that in the Astral Plane, there are tones of colors that we never knew existed.A MUST read for anyone spiritually inclined!!!PS: The first 4 Chapters can be a bit confusing and ""boring"", but once it gets to Chapter 4, then you can't wait until the next Chapter!!! It even says in the beginning of the book, that you may be ""tempted"" to skip to Chapter 4, but PLEASE DON'T or else you will miss important information needed in order to better understand the rest of the book."
2,Buy if you have your own chef,"I purchased this book before it even hit the shelves because of how easy the preparation of the meals was supposed to be. The day before I was induced with my second child, I spent 3 and a half hours at the grocery store (with my 16 month old) trying to find all of the ingredients necessary for the plan. Over $300 later, I thought I had everything. Not so! On the very first day there were items on the menu that were not part of the shopping list. And meal preparation?! Not as easy as described for a new mom with a newborn. I needed a personal chef to get everything done for me. No wonder celebrities rave about this plan...they have money and chefs!"
5,Body After Baby ROCKS!,"As a 2nd time new momma -- and a busy fashion & beauty publicist -- I was yearning to take off the pounds oh-so-quickly. I put on too much weight the first time around, and even though I watched it more this time, I still indulged in one too many slices of pizza (late night craving???) and too few trips to the gym. Needless to say, after my bundle of joy made his grand entrance, there was much ""me"" work to be done. Enter Jackie. From the moment I came home from the hospital, Jackie and her Body After Baby Book and Progam make it a no brainer for losing the weight AND feeling great. With no effort -- and all the while enjoying great food -- I was able to shed those extra baby pounds in no time. Now, if only getting junior to sleep through the night was as easy as this...."
5,Body After Baby,"It's been two months since I had my son and I have been longing for the motivation to get back into shape. After picking up Body After Baby, I realized this was the answer. Easy to follow at home recipes and exercises, I was able to loose my baby weight and bond with my baby. I was so amazed at the types of food I was able to eat like chocolate. I had my energy back and my body!"
3,Hard to implement as a new mother,"While this book is informative and seems to be based on an effective method for losing weight, I found the actual meal plan difficult to follow being a mother of a newborn. I barely had time to do things like showering, cleaning up the house and laundry each day - forget actually making somewhat time intensive meals three times a day! I would have liked to follow the plan as it was laid out in the book, but I just couldn't do it. My experience was that the first 30 days after having a baby are too chaotic to focus on cooking this much. Maybe further down the road I will be more in control to do this program. With that said, I did feel that the book had good information!"
4,great plan for after baby - not strange foods!,"After reading many of the reviews for this book, I found lots of negativity regarding the food. Many said that the items were tough to find at your local grocery store and that they were strange foods. Well, with the exception of some of the whole grains (like whole barley, etc...) I was able to get just about everything for the first 10 days at my local grocery. The meals are creative and fun - and while things did change every day, leaving me with leftovers, it was food that I could feed to the rest of my family. Many reviewers complained that the recipes made food for more than just one person...well, if you need to cut the recipe, I found that it was fairly simple to do.All in all, I found the food plan great! Now if I could just be self-disciplined enough to actually DO THE EXERCISES, I'm sure Keller's plan would be absolutely fantastic! :)"
2,Expensive diet plan,"I was not fully staisfied with this book because the food required for the diet is expensive and hard to find. For a lot of the food you would need to go to a health food store because a regular store doesn't carry the items. I'm sure the diet would work, but you would have to have the funds to complete it."
2,Not realistic,The recipes are all fine and good but they require a gigantic shopping list and cooking for 4. Not realistic. I have a 5 month old and have lost the weight but not with the help of this book. Eat less exercise more but don't deprive yourself of anything.
2,Wasn't for me.,"A great plan for a new mom with a nanny AND a chef. I hardly have the time to prepare one meal, much less six!"
4,Good portable fake book.,Good portable fake book for those who don't play by ear. Small enough to fit in purse or pocket. Hymn selection is good.
2,Inexpensive But Small,"This is a small paperback size book. I bought it because it included guitar chords. Unfortunately, they're chords that many guitarist can't play. The small size, pulpy paper and difficult chords make this hard for me to use. A better, but not perfect, bet would be The Hymn Fake Book."
4,Good movie..,"Actually I just caught this movie on cable. I grew up JW and knew exactly what this young woman was going through. I cried the whole movie! It's sad that cults like this can tear families apart in the name of God. It's a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone who grew up,left or is thinking about joining the JW'S."
1,Same old cliche story and inaccurate,"I grew up around Jehovah's Witnesses so I know first hand that the movie is not accurate. Accuracy is a big thing to me. The last thing I want to do is succumb to the media hype and hitch a ride on the mob-mentality hate wagon. Even if the movie had been accurate It still wasn't worth my time, same old cliche story. If you twenty something then you are too old for this movie."
2,Its a decent dog treat.,"I bought these as a healthy treat for my new boxer puppy. To begin with, I recieved canidae dog treats .. for senior and over weight. The description of the product does not mention this. My puppy ate the treats fine and seemed to enjoy them, but I found them to be a bit messy. After a treat there would be crumbs all over the floor. Nonetheless, my puppy found them tasty."
2,"Disaponting, and focused on the players","This attractive looking book was a disapointment for me. While it was clear the author had signifigant knowledge and invested time in researching the full history, the book focuses heavily on the politics and business planning of the underground - rather than the design and engineering, or the impact of the line on the urban planning of the city. I felt the book would be more accurately titled ""The key players of the london underground""."
2,macro headache,This toy is impossible to close. It is marketed as if you can close the van and actually transport it. The several little pieces required for the stunts have to be disassembled and crammed into the van during any futile attempt to close it. The car launcher which is essential to perform any of the stunts periodically jams. My 6 year old has barely touched the toy. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,FIND SOMETHING BETTER FOR YOUR LITTLE GUY,"This was the number 1 toy on my sons wish list for his birthday. This toy was very disappointing. Cheap,clunky and FRUSTRATING! There are too many little parts that need to be attached, detached and re-attached every time you want to close it. It doesn't close without a struggle. My 5-year-old already lost some of the accessories and the handle snapped off as we were walking to Grandpa's house some 6 houses away. He never really plays with it until he sees the flashy and deceptively slick commercial on TV and then he excitedly pulls it out and, within 5 minutes, becomes frustrated with it and walks away - disappointed once again. His birthday was in October and I hope to locate the reciept and get a refund. What a waste. And worse...seeing the disenchantment in his eyes everytime he pulls it out of his toy box. Shame on Hasbro for marketing such a poorly made product."
1,Don't buy this,"I bought this for my son's 4'th birthday - what a hunk of junk!The ""stunts"" don't work as the plastic pieces of track don't line up very well and I haven't been able to get the stupid truck close again. This thing belongs in the trash. My boys (and me and my husband) got really frustrated with this thing and it's been sitting in the corner ever since."
2,Super Junk City,"My son spent his own birthday money on this and was sooooo disappointed. He returned it a week later. In his own words, ""mom they should call this Super Junk City not Super Stunt City""!! Once you finally get it open and set up, it is sure to frustrate you when it falls apart. Also forget about closing it without a major struggle. If your child is out of the norm with LOTS of patience then go for it, if not I would recommend something else."
2,Fun but a pain!,"Bought it for my 5 yr old at Christmas - it's held up well but is impossible to fold up and store ...so it stays open. Little cars are worse than legos when you step on them. The little cars also never seem to get played with other than with the set unlike matchboxes. My son seems to like it, but it doesn't get used as often as I would expect. Save your money - buy legos!"
4,Not terribly bad...,"Have a 2yr old son and he loves this toy.Pros- Keeps him entertained! He cant do all the stunts but enjoys zooming the cars down the car ramp etc. Its an active toy and keeps his attention, and I even enjoy playing with it too.Cons- Already lost a car, small pieces are hard to keep track of, and the truck is SO hard to put together and have stay together, we cant carry it by the handle b/c it falls open and pieces go everywhere.Overall- Rate it a 4. I am buying it for another 2 yr old for Christmas present as well."
1,"Mini city, mini-fun!","This toy was purchased for my 3 year old brother by someone unfamiliar with small children. He was frustrated at not being able to make the stunts work. The small cars and accessories were dangerous to him and adults who stepped on them. The over-all 'truck' does not go back together well. This item was zero fun, for all concerned."
1,This Santa brought junk,"Christmas Morning here...This is truly a disappointing toy.The first time we closed it up, two of the doors came off the hinges. The quality is bad and it's far too complicated for a child to set up on his own.I agree with whomever said *Shame on Hasbro.* For sure.Next year Santa is going to read every toy review before purchasing~"
1,What a let down.,"We bought it for my 3yr old son. After setting it up, the thing didn't even work. The tracks don't line up and it's a pain to assemble back into a truck. We headed right back to the store that same night and got our money back. Don't waste your time, money and effort on this toy, especially if your child doesn't yet know much about it. My son thought it was really cool but didn't really know all it's features till I told him about them and how cool it was that he could take it with him places. After getting him all excited about it, he was very sad that we returned it."
2,YUCK. READ THIS FIRST,"Well, I purchased this for my 6 year old. I loved the idea it was compact and self cantained. Boy was I wrong. It has to be assembled each and every time you play with it. Something he can't do on his own (and he is no slouch!). The main door keeps falling off as well. He has played with it maybe three times. It is now in the goodwill box!"
2,Review,"I bought this toy for my son this Christmas. I have to say that my son likes this toy and it is a good idea. BUT I find it not durable, believe it or not is difficult to open and close, one of the part already came off, I don't recomend this toy at all. My son has to call me to close it and every time I close this toy I get very frustrated because is it so hard. If I knew this toy was like this I wouldn't of buy it plus is not worth the price."
2,He's played with it twice & its in shambles,"At first, this looked pretty good. The 1st time my 2 1/2 yr old played with it, he had a great time. The second time things started falling off. Each time it gets harder to put it back together. I suspect it will be the first Xmas toy to be thrown away."
1,Bad Santa,I purchased this toy for my 5 year old for christmas and to this day he has not been able to close this truck by himself. I have attempted and pieces keep falling off. I was very disappointed in this truck. It looked pretty cool on TV. LOOKS ARE DECEIVING!!!
1,Very Disappointing,"Very few of the stunts worked as the parts didn't line up. I could not get it closed. The box looked great as it had good ideas but it just doesn't work. Please don't waste your money or your time, because you will have to return it."
4,Good card to have,"Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market. But it is a solid, reliable card. The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card. However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd. A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images. scary. However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT. I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT."
4,Long weekend is a forgotten classic,"LONG WEEKEND was made during an Aussie film boom in the 1970's. SO many films came out around 1976-1978 that it's no surprise that some films can be overlooked down the track.LONG WEEKEND centres on a couple who are at a bad point in their relationship - constant bickering, arguing, fighting. A chance to get away camping over a long weekend is surely the cure to their problems? No. It just adds to them. The movie cleverley uses the surrounding elements to create a very eeery atmosphere. The tension slowly builds to a climax that you will never see coming.This forgotten Aussie classic was released last year on DVD in Australia with a few extras. It's now available on DVD in USA too. A movie worth adding to your collection - a snapshot of camping trips to the Aussie coast in the 70's. Well worth a look."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on...,Rubel Shelly and Max Lucado are two of the strongest proponents of false doctrine today. That's too bad because Shelly once preached the true Gospel. This book ought to give you a good idea of the gulf between Shelly's version of convenient Christianity and the truth found in the inspired word of God.
2,This is no Inspector Clouseau romp.,"This was not a very good book. Even though Steve Martin played Inspector Clouseau in the movie, I visualized Peter Sellers in the movie. That kept it from being a total waste of time."
2,not even close,This cover is advertised for the Porsche Boxster but its not even close.Its clearly for a smaller car. It doesn't really fit the front or the back and there is a good 4 or 5 inches of the bottom edge of the car showing. To top it off it doesn't even come with a proper securing straps. Just a little bit of cheap twine to secure it under the car. There are only 2 security grommets (one on either side) and so it pops off every time there's a gust of wind.I had to wait 2 weeks longer than the Amazon estimated time to delivery. The company sent me an email telling me it was taking longer so that they could custom fit the cover for my car. I'm more than a little bit insulted by that now. If your trying to save a little cash buying this for your boxster don't bother go ahead and go with another company and get one custom fit for your model its. If there wasn't a massive snow storm that hit minutes after I got the cover on I would have returned it then and there.
4,As described mostly,"The product was exactly what I needed except the fitting for the wire harness was not as pictured, which is why I bought this item. I ended up having to purchase an adapter to go from the 150 series harness to the 220 series, which is the newer 4 pin flat connector. You're results will vary, as I was also installing an aftermarket, Racetronix, power harness to provide a constant voltage to the pump via a relay. Other than that, it came with a new o-ring, a new wiring harness, and everything worked as it should after being installed."
3,Good date film,"Cute story! Cute actors! A piece of romantic fluff, but a pleasant way to spend 90 min."
2,A Touch of Pinkeye Maybe...,"A very slow moving script, misdirected direction, and a sappy, and do I mean sappy ending really throw this film a curveball. I enjoyed these characters, especially the real relationship between a gay Muslim man and his mother. I didn't care much for his boyfriend, he was manipulative and a cheater. Frankly our hero could have done better, and derserved better. The ending was a little too tidy for me. These were complex characters in a complex situation. The really stupid part of the film is the imaginary friend/spirit guide in the guise of the ghost of Cary Grant. This part was very distracting, and was used to lighten the mood. For the collector this movie has very little importance nor entertainment. Watch ""Torch Song Trilogy"" again. It'll have more suprises and laughs even on the third go around. A real disapointment."
1,Sickeningly Sappy,"Being a Queer As Folk viewer, I thought I could handle any sappy, trite and overly sentimental screenplay. Apparently not. This could have been a really interesting story about a gay man torn between obligation to his family's culture versus his right to act from the values of HIS culture (Canadian).Instead, we get an imaginary friend who is suppose to be Cary Grant who gives him advice. About half way through the film I just couldn't stand it anymore and had to fast forward through the Cary Grant sequences. If this film had been a really campy comedy, Cary Grant could have worked -- but....ah, no. It was just baaaaad.The only good thing in this film was the cranky mother who was funny and just gorgeous to look at."
3,Boring and hard to understand,"The accents in this movie take some time to get used to, but if you turn the volume up and really listen intently you'll get it. The story is the same old thing, mom's coming and I'm not out yet. I saw Chicken Tikka Masala before this and it's the same story. I just didn't get into this one very much."
3,Very Cary,"This is a fun film about an average Joe and his imaginary friend (no it is not a Rabbit, but none other than Cary Grant (Kyle MacLachlan does an outstanding job with his impersonation)). Alim's (Jimi Mistry) life is turned upside down as he ties to conceal his gay lifestyle from his overly ""traditional"" Indian mother (suleka mathew) who decides to visit from out of town...time for a ""straight eye for a gay guy"" as Alim and his Lover try to ""de-gay"" the apartment; can Alim's imaginary friend get him out of this mess, or will he only worsen the situation?Fun Film: Pop some Popcorn & Sit Back and Giggle (it's not a side splitter by any stretch, but it's entertaining) Even my straight older brother enjoyed the antics..."
3,"In the tradition of ""Mambo Italiano""","There's a quite a number of good, low-budget films coming out of Canada these days. Like the recent ""Mambo Italiano,"" ""Touch of Pink"" focuses on the pressure of an immigrant son from a large Canadian city (Toronto here, Montreal in 'Mambo') struggling to balance family responsibility and sexual identity. 'Pink' is well done and presents that dilemma honestly - kudos to Ian Iqbal Rashid for writing and directing a nice little tale.The real surprise here? Kyle MacLachlan, who is outstanding as 'the spirit of Cary Grant.' It's a spot-on impersonation. Who knew this guy had this talent? MacLachlan's effort alone makes 'Pink' worth your time to rent or buy.Oh, just how low-budget is 'Pink'? Low budget enough where co-star Kristin Holden-Reid gets credited as Kristin Holden-Ried. No spellchecker? Now, that's pinching pennies."
5,Birdcage meets Bollywood?,"I found this film to be highly entertaining - a sweet look at the struggles of a gay Indian man living in America to come out to his family and introduce his boyfriend. I highly recommend this film as a fun, romantic, feel-good gay coming out film."
5,Too Good!,"I used to be able to find this a lot more easily, but it has become more scarce in the US in the last few years. I have always made my PB&J's using this instead of the grape jelly. They make a key lime version too, which I haven't tried, but I'm sure it is just as wonderful. It's good stuff and well worth the wait!"
5,Very good tool...,"I absolutely love this cd, which I have had for 3 years now. Every time I go back to it I rediscover a great tool which takes me on a very deep journey.When used with my visual meditaitons I have the most vivid expereinces. Sometimes I sleep with it and in those times I also have very vivid dreams.It's all a matter of what you are looking for. It's not a Cd to be listened to for litening sake. If you looking for a good tool for deeper meditations and mystical experiences it is great."
4,Very Satisfied,"I was very pleased with the availability of this textbook. My professor had originally reserved a different book then changed her mind last minute. The first day of class we not only had an assignment, but we also had to scramble to get the ""revised"" book. Thanks to Amazon for giving such prompt service."
3,Operations Management for Competitive Advantage,"I was unhappy with this item because some important product information was omitted from the site, and I was unsure that I was ordering the correct edition of the book I needed."
3,Good but not great,"I ordered this book from Amazon,com because even after shipping and handling costs I saved a few bucks compared to what I would have paid at my University's book store. It took a while for the book to arrive and when it did it had a huge crease/bend on the front cover, as I needed the book I didn't complain but after all, I only saved a few Dollars, it took quite a while for the book to arrive and then it was so poorly packed (just had a thin plastic wrap around it) that it did not look as good as you'd expect a new book for over $120 to look."
3,Cumbersome Reading,"I went thru this book as part of my MBA program. This book covers a lot of ground in operations management area, but is cumbersome to read. In many cases, the material doesn't flow very well, and is difficult to understand as often the authors have missed key assumptions and background information that is key to understand the concept being presented. Also the book has way too many chapters. Some of the chapters are just too generic and don't have much meaningful and useful information. The case studies are good and very helpful in understanding the underlying concepts."
3,Okay,This book seems to pretty good. My instructor that had us buy it for class has decided to not really use now though. But as far as I can tell it is pretty good book if you are interested in manufacturing.
3,bought for college,this book was simply just ok. nothing very interesting about the theory involved and it was a requirement for my economics class.
4,Robert Cray - 'Sweet Potato Pie' (Mercury),"Never being all THAT much of a blues fan,I must admit,this man knows his craft and he knows it well.His guitar work on this record is just as amazing as his vocals.All ten tracks are very well written and produced.Cuts that made me sit up and take notice were ""Little Birds"",""I Can't Quit"",""Not Bad For Love"" and ""Simple Things"".Nice modern-day electric blues.Also notice he does a cover of the late Otis Redding's ""Trick Ot Treat"".Very good.Should appeal to fans of Buddy Guy,Jimmy Vaughan,Keb Mo' and maybe Eric Clapton.Worth checking out."
4,A Soulful Step in the Right Direction,"Robert Cray has never shirked from the challenge of bringing new dimensions to the limited range of the blues. These extra musical dimensions have always come from R&B and soul, as obviously these musical genres have very strongly influenced Cray. So, it's no surprise that an album like Sweet Potato Pie should occur. This is a strong album that has more akin to Midnight Stroll than Strong Persuader or Shame + A Sin, calling our attention to the Stax/Volt era of R&B evolution. It's also no surprise that the name of Otis Redding should come up in the credits. ""Trick or Treat"" is a wonderful Redding cover, and the whole album pays homage to Redding as Cray exercises his best soulful vocal impersonation of the late lamented soul singer throughout. Overall, a strong effort and a soulful step in the right direction."
4,"Solid outing, emphasis on the vocals","This one will sneak up on you. Cray is a wonderful performer with an expressive vocal style that really sells a song. ""Do That for Me,"" has a wicked vocal, harkening back to the classic soul of Marvin Gaye. Utilizing the Memphis Horns throughout adds to the sweetness of this CD; Cray just sounds like he's having a great time. Mostly Cray originals mixed with a great Redding cover ""Trick or Treat,"" SWEET POTATO PIE is a great example of Cray the singer. I do wish he would have ripped into a few more solos, but that's a minor point. This is a nice example of Robert Cray's work."
4,"Excellent work, Cray fans won't be disappointed!","This latest Cray album leans more toward the Stax/Volt soul sound than straight blues (as on his earlier ""Midnight Stroll""), but Cray's honest, smooth vocals, clever phrases, and of course the scintillating guitar work, are all present and accounted for. Good backup horns and strong drumming lend punch to the sound. A must for fans of blues or soul."
3,african stomp!,"when i orderd this album, amazon.com did not provide it with a list of tracks. now they do, but it's to late...there's another compilation called ""afro rock vol. 1"".as it turns out, they are the same album - only this one presented here is the japan version of it, and the difference is that this edition has 3 bonus tracks, so be advised as to not buy ""afro rock vol. 1"" !!!that been said, ""deep funk africa"" is quite a good compilation, specially for it's bonus tracks, but just about half of the tracks are really good. it's worth the buy only for track 13 ""african stomp""."
4,Lighter but not lacking...,"Some will complain ""not heavy enough"" but this release definitely is not lacking in the songwriting ability that are Lana and company. When the intensity of Lana's other releases just don't fit the moment, you'll find yourself reaching for this disc. The original material is captivating and there are hypnotizing remakes of ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" and ""California Dreamin.'"" The disc runs just shy of an hour but could be easily extended once ""Carry Me Home"" hits your speakers. This is an incredible tune that screams ""replay"" each time you hear it so it might just delay your getting to the rest of the selections!"
3,Puts me to sleep,Im not saying it is really bad but I was hoping for some heavy tunes...But I have to say put the earphones on when your about to go to sleep and put the cd in and your good to go..Cleveland ROCKS!!!
2,C-minus for Lana,"Unfortunately, Lana doesn't seem to be moving anywhere with this uninspiring release. A couple of covers here are the best sounding tracks here and that says something... Perhaps ""Carry Me Home"" is more or less close to her best songs but this is definitely far cry from her previous albums like ""Queen Of The Ocean"" or ""Garden Of The Moon"". What's regrettable is that Lana and Erik keep producing these all-sound-alike songs which could have shined if they just spent more time on coming up with some fresher and more ambitious tunes (lyrics are OK by me). To recap, I was definitely expecting more for my money. Too bad..."
5,No nice to be able to buy a replacement like this!,Mine broke one time when I was shredding cheese. Just snapped right off! It was over 10 years old and I think the plastic just got brittle but now I'm back in business! Thanks!
1,Cuisinart Detachable Stem,sent the wrong one....not the same model as requested. had to return it.simply not as advertised. was very disappointed.
1,Cuisinart Detachable Stem,"Product description is not specific enough and I had to return the item. The molded shape of the stem on the inside is different from mine and you cannot tell that there are variances by the photo or description. The product sent was factory original, just not the correct piece for my machine."
1,Dreadful,"Do not buy this toy puppy. It made one sound and then, after going online to find out how to make it do anything else, took forever to make it lick at all. The manufacturer wasn't even helpful. We actually ended up throwing it away. Amazing? I don't think so!"
3,Rushed performances and facelifts,"The facelift is primarily ""Tarkus-Aquatarkus,"" which is the best version of that suite. Faster, frenetically brilliant, and fun. The ""Aquatarkus"" improvisation is extended and wild and eerie; the unhurried stuff by Lake, including ""Epitaph,"" is deeper and plaintive. ""Piano Improvisations"" track is way fun too, and Keith also shines in the ""Take a Pebble"" interludes of piano playing. Otherwise, the rest of the set is lousy compared w/ the studio realeases."
5,Intense,"The author has taken the very complex subject matter of distributed object development and successfully broken it down into several major pieces in this book. First, he succinctly leads you through the world of distributed systems, tiers and layers, and object orientation. He then talks about the COM and DCOM world and how they relate to distributed system development. Many books would stop there, but the author then proceeds to lay out an entire application framework that can be built with the stuff that Microsoft provides. While I have just started digging into the details, I am impressed by what I have seen so far. If you are serious about pushing your applications to the limit, you should look at this book."
4,Topical N-Tier Development,"The book covers vb-object to db-tables mapping. The download code for this is not in sync with the book on areas such as ClassManager/Lib and on the DataManager GetObject (set DataManager ClassDef.DatabaseName), some Interface Methods too, an (optional?) XML parameter. With no installation Readme or Errata file this could be overcome by the author (please) update the downloadable code. Although Session Variables (and ActiveX Controls)are used in places there is no talk of their security limits. Otherwise an excellent book!"
1,Wrong.,"Some of these songs seem different than the studio versions that I am used to from Highway 61 and Blonde on Blonde. For example, on ""Visions of Johanna"" this book has it in the key of G. As far as I can tell it's in the key of A. You don't even use the G chord to play the song. The fact that they never tell you when to use a capo is also suspicious. I know it's hard to find tab for some of Dylan's classics but this book is no more helpful than some tab you might find on the internet. It just costs more."
4,Bob Dylan Anthology,"This is an excellent book covering all of the most popular Bob Dylan songs you are likely to play. It includes all the lyics, the cords, and tablature. The tablature also includes information on when to strum up and down, which is very good for the new guitarist who is having trouble picking up the type of strumming used on the album. I did not give it 5 stars because this type of book really should have a coil binding so it will lay flat when referring to it and playing."
1,A real piece of garbage,The tab is aweful! You can't really even call it tab because it bears no relation to the notation. It is simply a generic pattern to strum the chords. Ridiculous. Don't be fooled.
5,Addictingly Good,"My son absolutely loves this. He watches it over and over and over. I know he has it memorised but he still puts it in every day. Its a nice show, not a bad thing to be addicted to."
1,Not a quality product,"It should be noted that the Amazon description for this product is wrong. It does NOT contain both English and Japanese audio tracks. No 4Kids DVDs ever do (save for a few rare, uncut releases).Sonic X may not be one of 4Kids WORST dubbed animes, but it ranks fairly high. Things are edited out for seemingly no reason, even the mildest of violence is cut, Japanese text and refferences are blanked and not even translated, and entire episodes are re-arranged. Not to mention, plenty of refferences to the Sonic games are not translated properly.Do not buy this set if you are looknig for a high-quality, entertaining product."
3,"May be great to play tennis, but not for dog toy","I bought these for my labrador retriever to play catch in the backyard. He loves to chase balls and chew on them. These balls didn't last 5 minutes and he had already broken the ball and had most of the yellow outer covering torn off. I then went to Target and bought the Wilson balls, 3 for $[...] and they lasted for 3 weeks before he broke them. Maybe we got a bad batch, but I'll be going to Target to get him balls there. Much cheaper and sturdier for him."
2,Mostly Misses The Beat,"There are much better books about what goes on in the life and the mind of a drummer. This book has a few good chapters -- if you are interested enough in the topic. There are some good stories but, overall, it is not very well written. The book could have benefited from a lot of serious editing.""The Big Beat: Conversations With Rock's Great Drummers"" by Robert Santelli and Max Weinberg is much more insightful. If you are looking for a book that gets inside the music, get ""The Big Beat"" or ""Great Drummers R&B; Funk & Soul,"" a really interesting book by Jim Payne.If you really, really, really want to know about the drummers in this book, you might possibly consider this book."
5,"All notable drummers of the era, both famous and lesser-knowns, are included","Now in its second printing, the classic survey GREAT ROCK DRUMMERS OF THE SIXTIES provides a history of the era's best rock drummers and drumming - and here is reissued in its original form with added revised data updating drummer biographies to modern times. All notable drummers of the era, both famous and lesser-knowns, are included in chapters which review tours, notable achievements, pack in plenty of vintage black and white photos, and chart the rise of rock groups.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,Secure Chain,Great chain for our goal. The secure locks are what made us choose this chain net. Others we've tried kept coming loose.
1,approx.15 min. long!!!,im sorry that i purchased this item. there is no detailed information given. the dvd lasts about 15 minutes
2,Come on Too Short,Alright look Too Short is one of my favorite rappers but lets face it. These songs on the CD are over 15 years old and have been remastered many times and sold on albums. There good songs short but why are you trying to make money off stuff you've already made your money for.
3,You may not agree with all the politics but,"it is worth a watch if only for the information they give in this.1. Very informative. The section on all of the nuclear weapons that have gone missing in the past 50 years was down right frightening. There are a lot of weapons that we have no idea where they are.2. Good music. Most documentaries don't play classic punk style music.3. Makes you think about the immorality of using nuclear weapons as well as the immorality of war period.4. Does present the Catch 22. If we get rid of all our nukes, who says other countries will follow suit? They have a more optimistic view of nuclear disarmament.Worth a rent from your local library."
3,Julie,It wasn't what I expected but the content was very interesting and informative. There was too much repetitive information. This could have been shorter and would have still conveyed the same message
5,Timely,"A pointed look at a very timely subject, Countdown to Zero, does an excellent job of bringing those of us who may not remember the Cold War (and even those who do) up to speed on the destructive power and inherent danger of nuclear weapons and the precarious current nuclear posture of the world's nuclear states. Through, at times, shocking examples of close calls and detailed descriptions of nuclear destruction, Countdown makes the case for action and challenges each viewer to do something to address this problem that threatens all of humanity at [...]. I found this film to be very well-done and highly recommend it to anyone interested in global politics, weapons, and securing our collective future."
4,Very Insightful and needed!,"This is a book that's destined to become a MIDI how-to classic.I've waited for quite a while to find a book that not only explains MIDI programming in detail,but also provides source code,a well done and documented companion disk ,many book examples in C and C++,online support and forum for the book(big plus!).I would have given a perfect rating ,but I specialize in using a different programming language-but I understand how to convert the code to C/C++ .As the title indicates,applications in C++.Kudos to Paul Messick!"
4,OK.,"This book is about MKA's lives.There are few facts that were very useful but if you are a big fan and know alot about em,dont bother to read this book.But if you are a person who is just about to know them,buy this.Its a trrifect book for you if you dont have a clue about them; there is some pictures which we never saw before...cause its aculy from there family album.By the way,they are not the one who wrote this book.Soon there will be a book which they wrote them selves."
3,The book was OK,"The book had a lot of info, but not a lot of stuff that a true fan wouldn't already know and it only had like 9 pictures."
5,THE GREATEST BOOK EVER.........,"Are you a fan of Mary-kate and Ashley???If you are,you oughtta have it.Its got all the cool information about Mary-Kate and Ashley.In my country,its so hard to find even 1 Mary-Kate and Ashley book that i had to order this book all the way from amazon.com and I am very happy to say it wasnt a waste of money considerring the currency.It has 14 pictures of them and their family and at the back of the book,they tell you their favorites and how to send letters to them.It also tells you all the tittles of their videos,adventures books,youre invited books and videos,movies,cassetes and CDs,interactive games,books,new adventures books,full house Michelle books,full house sisters books,two of a kind and other tittles such as our story,their mood diary and much,much more."
1,WHAT HAPPEN???,"I purchased thing is not very good. They gave me a Imaging unit but It's a used thing.BUT I HAD TRUST IN SELLER,WHAT HAPPEN??? Absolutely I bought the new thing. Supply Error so on. Everyone, DO THINK CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING SOMETHING."
4,First and Short,"This album is to be a great Canadian recording from the Kerns and Dahle Brothers ""The Age Of Electric"". Should be noticed more for music fans in the U.S. Now no longer together!!"
4,"Great band, great album","It was a dark day when Age of Electric broke up! They are an amazing Canadian band and they put on an excellent live show. It is a shame that they did not get much, if any, air play in the US and likely that was part of what split them up. Their previous CD was a better CD, but this one still has a few catchy tunes that keep it in my CD rotation still to this day. I strongly recommend checking out Todd Kerns album (was the lead singer...the guy has an amazing voice!), of of course the great Limblifter (made up of the Dahle brothers)!"
5,Second and not so short..LOL,"I bought this CD in the summer of '98 and since then it has been one of my favourites. I know you probably have never heard of this band before, but they are amazing. They have a really unique sound, I've never heard anything like them. Everything's great on here, the poetic, abstract lyrics; the vocals, and the instruments are all great. My favoutrite tracks are ""Remote Control"", ""I Don't Mind"", ""Nothing Happens"" and ""Mad at the world"". Great CD."
4,All Sorts of Styles Converge on this Cool Recording,"Not every song on this album is a classic (why only 4 stars), but the ones that are make this album well worth buying. A hint of James Bond intertwined through a few songs makes this spy-esque album a must have for anyone who feels they'd like an eclectic mix of World, Jazz, Electronic, and Funk."
1,Toshiba 755e,"I bought this PDA two years ago. It has never synched well with either my laptop or my desktop. I always have to reset the PDA in order for it to synch. This didn't happen when it was new and Toshiba tells me it can only be my virus protection. I have also gone through three batteries. I was told today (3/1/05) that the battery is now $84 and that Toshiba no longer repairs PAs. Overall, very poor support from Toshiba."
5,Best Buy PDA,"It is a best buy PDA. It connects to wireless network without a single problem. Easy to setup and fast for even non-PDA tailor web-site. Compared with Palm Tungsten T, the pocket PC OS is far more sophsicated and powerful. And the PC2003 version is stable. Featurewise, this PDA is second to none. And the price is really good. In addition, I brought extension pack with this PDA, which is only $15 after rebate. With keyboard and extension pack, I don't need my notebook anymore.It really is a gem for mobile professional."
3,Toshiba support,"This is would be an almost perfect PDA from my experience with an e740, (it does not have the screen resolution of my former Sony Palm OS PDA'S), BUT support is not good. They did answer my E-mail support question quickly, but had no solution. Even though my unit is not very old, they will not provide an upgrade to Mobile 2003, which it could easily support. I suspect support for the e75x PDA's will be equally poor and short lived, which translates into upgrading being very expensive. Buyer beware."
2,Ok product from a bad company,"Like the others, I found this unit to be well designed, although lacking in features compared to similar products from HP, such as the iPAQ H5455 and H5555, although the iPAQs usually cost more than the Toshiba. However, the ""what you pay is what you get"" concept holds true in this case and the money you saved with the Toshiba, in my opinion, is not worth it. Toshiba has very bad customer service and rarely, if ever, come up with patches and upgrades to their ROM software. After owning 2 different Toshiba PPCs, I switched to an iPAQ and never looked back."
1,another doa,first was totally doasecond had the wireless went deadthird had the rom disk go doaword to the wise - avoid this thing !
3,"Good Device, but has flaws...","I bought that device because of all the features and it seems to be very useful. Wireless and the Transcriber works perfect and I'm very impressed with the device.However now it starts to act up a little, first I tought I did something to it but the problems keep coming back:When I try to shut it down with the Power Button I always get the screen alignment Screen and cannot turn the device off at all.Some applications won't start anymore because everytime I select them the red dots keep coming up and present the copy/paste menu.This is very annoying because you have to reset the device over and over again and I try to find a fix [OS update or Flash Update], but when there is no solution Toshiba will get it back.And as I can see here there are more people which are having the same problem I have. So it is a flaw in the thing itself.So wait till this problem is solved before buying one..."
1,disappointed,I bought this item with a lot of high hopes. I had used a Compaq Ipaq for about a year and thought this would be an upgrade. After having constant problems with resets and the wireless feature I am about to give up on it. I didn't realize what a poor product this is until after my 30 days to return it so I guess I am stuck with it. I probably should have waited til the new series came out. Don't make the same mistake I did.
3,"Nice, But Beware","I really like my 755, fast, awesome screen. But, if you need wireless, you might want to look elsewhere, since these units suffer from the (in)famous ""ENUM interface"" error, which to date Toshiba has not fixed. It seems not all of the units have this error, but if you get one that does you will need to soft reset a lot, right in the middle of a wireless session."
3,display is inferior to hp,"the display brightness and contrast is worse than models from hp. i would recommend comparing the displays at the local store if this is a concern for you. as it is i feel that pda's are hard on the eyes, so it is important for me to get the best possible display. otherwise, this is probably an excellent unit. however, i can't comment on customer service issues."
2,Too expensive a device to never have worked properly.,Toshiba seems to have gotten out of the Pocket PC business which is a good thing. Even when new there was zero support on this product.
4,"Funny book, but there's better stuff out there.","Very creative and funny book. It makes you wonder what this guy does all day. You will laugh out loud at the hilarious yet ridiculous scenarios presented by the author. If you like silly humor, buy this. The best material I have ever seen in this genre is on ... Check it out!Again, a good book to read with friends, at parties, in groups, etc."
1,No WPA support with NetGear Router,"If you have WEP or No security on your wireless network this will work fine, but if you have WPA or WPA2 you are out of luck. Even though the package says WPA is supported, when you email Kodak support they will tell you it is NOT supported with certian wireless routers. My NetGear WGR614 for example does not work with this card."
2,elementary-level textbook,Best suited for a readership with small vocabularies and without much skill in following arguments. Perhaps a junior high school audience would most enjoy this book.
4,Challenging!,I had the opportunity to have Dr. Selvidge for a World Religions class. She used some of this book to help teach us. The parts I read were intriguing and challenging. Her wrting forces you to look at religion from a different point of view. For that reason alone this book is worth every penny!
5,Holy Spirit,We were trying to choose a book for our next Bible study. This book fit the bill. Precise and thought provoking. For the Christian wanting to go to the next level.
4,One of the best prog-rock albums ever,"5.1 mix is excellent. Even the throwaway tunes are fun to hear again. Booklet needs serious proofreading, though. Misspellings, repeated words, grammatical errors, etc."
5,Stereo remix Awesome,After 40 years they actually improve on the new mix of this incredible classic progressive rock CD abd add some new cuts for old fans ... perfectly classic
2,sobrevalorado,"Tarkus ha sido considerado desde siempre una de las piedras angulares del sonido ELP. Oído ahora, desde la distancia, seguimos valorando la antigua cara A, es decir la suite Tarkus, como representativa de un modo de hacer las cosas que, con sus aciertos y errores, marcó una época. Sin embargo, los demás temas no superan la media de mediocreidad. Ninguno de ellos es verdaderamente un ""must""."
5,"Steven Wilson takes a classic,and makes it current....","Steven Wilson is a genius in his own right.The man is constantly working.With his own bands,to mixing,producing etc...The man has saved Rock and Roll for me.I own just about everything he creates,or is a part of.I listened to E.L.P.,King Crimson and many prog.band over the years.For Steven to come along,and not only make great music of his own with Porcupine Tree,Blackfield,No-Man,and his solo work throughout the last 20 years.He takes music that I love,and makes it better.If that's possible you say.Yes it certainly is.Don't think twice about this one.I have the original version,the gold Ultradisc version,of course Vinyl,Cassette,and 8 Track.This is the cream of the crop.Tarkus,and Pictures at an Exhibition for me are their best.I love ELP 1,and Trilogy,as well as Brain Salad Surgery.Tarkus is E.L.P.'s masterpiece for sure,and Mr.Wilson just made it a grand masterpiece."
1,TARKUS MELARKEY,"I have tried again to listen to this, and I still find it nearly unlistenable. And I like Skinny Puppy, Zoviet France and Pauline Oliveros.Tarkus (Deluxe Edition)"
1,Relatively horrible ELP,"Let me start by saying that I am a pretty big ELP fan. Trilogy, Brain Salad Surgery, and Pictures at an Exhbition are all consistently brilliant, and while the self-titled debut is a bit inconsistent, it definitely has its moments. However, Tarkus is consistently bad and in my opinion one of the worst albums of all time. Of all the 20+ minute suites of the prog genre (Atom Heart Mother, Karn Evil 9, Close to the Edge, 2112, Lizard, etc) Tarkus is by far the worst. It is pretentious, boring, barely listenable, and lacks any kind of musical coherence. The other tracks are all pretty weak as well, Bitches Crystal and Time and a Place being the only spots on the album with any kind of musical value. Are You Ready Eddy is vomit-inducing; it doesnt even have the comical value of the far superior Benny the Bouncer. If you are just getting into ELP but Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery, but avoid this unless you want to laugh at how bad prog can be."
3,One Great Side Then....................,"The side long title track is one of ELP's finest, but side two sounds like thrown together filler just for the sake of getting another record out.Typically uneven like most of their career."
3,Great title track,"I just bought Tarkus after becoming absolutely hooked on the far-superior Brain Salad Surgery. It starts off triumphantly, with the 20-plus minute masterpiece, ""Tarkus"". Unfortunately, it doesn't take long for the entire mood of the album to disintegrate into forgettable, often silly songs. The ridiculous ""Jeremy Bender"" evoked pictures in my mind of a square dance in a saloon, while ""Are you Ready Eddy?"" is shamefully sloppy for a band that was supposedly known for their exceptional musical talent. The lyrics throughout the second half are often painful, especially the rhyme, ""Why did He lose/Six million Jews"" from ""The Only Way"".Nevertheless, the album deserves a 3 star rating based entirely on the strength of the title track."
2,help me...,Are there anymore albums out there that tell the story of rodents/battle vehicles ? How does this dreck fit in with what is considered music? Three guys trying to outdo each other. I blame Iron Butterfly.Peace.
3,Five great minutes...,"...for half an hour of ugly music?Well, not that bad considering that many prog rock albums have no good minutes at all. The title track on Tarkus is really, really interesting -well-crafted, well-played, difficult to classify music.The rest is a mix of leftover King Crimson ballads, Emerson's terrible jams and Palmer showing off everything you can do with a set of drums (not necessarily what a good musician would do). Oh, well."
4,Samples Needed,"I am interested in this item but before I spend the $18+, I would very much like the opportunity to hear samples of the tracks.I am giving it 4 stars without having heard or ordering it because just in case it is a good album, I don't want to keep others from getting it."
3,"Well filmed, but not very dramatic.","Film of a 1991 Expedition from the Tibetan north side. The expedition had one of the best stretchss of weather in Everest history and managed to place 10 climbers on the summit. An emphasis of the team was to make a clean-up of basecamp and higher camps on the peak. While not a dramatic story or of dramatic content, the good weather allows for good footage, and a video camera was taken all the way to the summit."
3,Inaccurate on purpose,"Necessary read for Comparative/ Historiography Skills class. Debateable info, which is the point of utilizing it in comparison to other pieces on the Frontier. Out-dated language usage makes it a little difficult to read."
1,WARNING: Save Your Money,"While not a exemplary example of the genre, 'A Man Called Django' (aka W Django!) you could do worse. What you may not be able to do worse with is this inexcusably bad transfer from Dagored. Dagored continues to put out what are some of the worst discs to date. The source quality is worse than a second generation copy of a VHS tape. The image is drastically cropped from the original 2:35.1 to 1.70:1. And it is also the cut version missing over 10 minutes of footage.Dagored is a company to avoid at all costs. If you need to see this movie, rent it. To date, it is the only version available with English subtitles."
5,Cross necklace,We love Paris Hilton's designs. This was gift for my daughter and received it promptly and in perfect condition.
1,COULDNT BE CHEAPER LOOKING,"IM SO UPSET, IT LOOKS LIKE TOTAL GARBAGE! SERIOUSLY FOR THIS PRICE I EXPECTED ALOT BETTER... I COULD HAVE GONE TO CLAIRES OR AFTERTHOUGHTS AND GOT A NECKLACE NICER AND PRETTY MADE FOR 5 BUCKS! THE PICS LIE, ITS SO UGLY ON! I WOULD BE EMBARASSED TO PUT MY NAME ON THIS PRODUCT BUT SINCE IT IS PARIS HILTON, U CANT REALLY EXPECT CLASS"
4,Way cute,"So cute!!! I thought it would be a little bigger when i got it, but it was still so very cute, although the links on it would come apart sometimes so that was kinda annoying but all an all i love it. But then i lost it so now i gotta buy another one."
5,Essential Series,"This is absoultely one cookbook that everyone should own. We own the entire series and there is no other cookbook like it. There are beautiful pictures for every recipe and the recipes are very unique, interesting, and delicious. Several recipes will suggest ingredients that may be difficult or expensive to find but the recipes can also be simplified. My husband loves to cook and looooves this entire series of cookbooks. This cookbook will help any chef tap into their creativity and explore their passion for cooking and take it to a new level."
3,About standard,"I bought this book because I enjoyed The King's Damosel, another book by Vera Chapman. While both plots follow unusual (and enjoyable!)twists and turns I feel the characterization in King Arthurs Daughter, particularly of Ursulet, was not as good. Also the story's conclusion left something to be desired. As King Arthur mythology goes, it's about standard, but I expected more from Vera Chapman."
3,"Nothing fantastic, but still enjoyable to read","As can be seen from the title, this book steps outside the realm of ""normal"" Arthurian legend simply by stating that Arthur and Guinevere had a child. The writing is good but not great, and the story is enjoyable but not completely gripping. Parts of the portrayal of Urselet seemed incongruent with other parts of the same book. Ambris's character was more believable. Though I have read better, I think anyone interested in Arthurian legend would enjoy this book, and I recommend it to them."
4,Solo,The product showed up on time. The battery life has been good. I would definitely recommend this product. It was a great value for the money
2,Don't buy it,"The problem with this unit is not the radar detector itself, which is adequate but not spectacular, but the windshield mount, which is just about useless and very frustrating. I've had it fall down 20 or more times during an hour. Look for something else."
1,Escort Solo S2 Cordless Radar and Laser Detector,This items is too weak and it eats batteries like no tomorrow. Also the worst is every-time you get in the car you have to turn it on. Its a pain. Get a wired one.
1,Dead Detector,"The device died after about two weeks. The seller was Electronica Direct; they are stalling about issuing a refund, based on the bogus assertion that I supposedly returned it to them without the proper packaging. (It had all the packaging.)"
4,Great cordless detector but why not add solar panel and rechargeable batteries?,"For a wireless radar and laser detector, this fits the bill -- I hate wires and cords. What I don't understand is why don't they add a solar panel and rechargeable batteries? The unit is always in the sun (during the day at least!) -- and then you'd never have to worry about dead batteries."
5,Escort Solo 2,I received what was supposed to be a used product in good condition----it was new! Sealed packaging and all!!!
2,its just ok,"This radar wasnt worth the price. if you are willing to pay 300 for one, you might as well just pay the extra 100 for a better model, i.e. the valentine one. The solo is nice, and it works occasionally, but if you are serious about your radar detectors, this one just doesnt do what it should for $300."
2,"Escort Solo S2,radar detector","I am displeased with its performance, not a good value for the money.does not provide adequate warnings."
3,Works Well for a cordless model,This unit works well for a cordless model. It does not do as good as some of my corded radar detectors from Escort but cordless never does. If you have to get a cordless radar detector this is the best one out there.
3,Excellent - but not as good as the corded model,"I own several Passports and recently bought the Solo. Fortunately, I am within the return period for exchanges. I am going to get another Passport. The range is good compared to most radar detectors, but abysmal when compared to a Passport with a cord."
3,X50 8500 vs Solo,"I bought the Solo for my classic Mustang. I also own a X50 8500 but I did not want the cord. I do not use this car much maybe a few hundred miles per year. So,to test its performance I put it right next to the X50 in my daily driver for a few days. It seems to detect K band almost as good. Ka is a few seconds behind.I did not come across any laser. I do not fully trust this one yet. Those few seconds that its behind the X50 is crucial.I will add more as I use it. It is the only real choice for a cordless on the market right now. I would recommend the X50 8500 if a cord is not a problem."
4,Good Detector,"I have lots of experience using radar detectors, and this by far is one of the best. I love that it doesn't have a cord too. Just make sure you get batteries that are rechargeable, they will only last a couple days if you use it all the time like I do."
4,Great Item Except....,"Overall I am very happy with this radar detector.My only complaint is that if I forget and leave it attached to the windshield when the car is parked in the sun the batteries go dead.This has happened twice now the first time the detector was left exposed to sun all day. The batteries at this point were the ones that came with the detector and had been in use approximately 2 weeks.The second time the detector was in the sun for only a few hours, and the batteries were only in for a week."
4,"Great Radar, but you need power cord!","I have owned several Escort radar detector models, and this Solo S2 cordless model reviews were good. In fact the radar capabilites are great, but the battery use is poor. You will need the smartcord. Running on battery constantly fails to detect movement as advertised and starts auto-shutdown(sleep) mode. Unless you plan to use this detector in multiple vehicles or on travel, just get the hard wired model 8500 and get the smartcord installed to your car wiring."
2,Great detector - but fragile....,"This is a great detector as long as it's working, however, the tiny suction cups that come equiped are not adequate to hold the detector and after it falls (which it will) a couple of times it stops working. This one lasted me six months. Why not equip with a suction cup similar to a GPS device?"
5,Realms of Russian Bear VHS tapes,"Excellent series. Never get tired of rewatching them. I would love to access DVD's, not made yet. The VHS tapes are in excellent condition. Would recommend this series to any nature lover. The range of terrain and presentation is superb."
5,Horror Icons in Same Movie,"Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee in the same movie for the first time was tantalizing. A lot of the actors in this movie, later appeared in Hammer Film productions. It was unnerving buf excellent!"
4,Nice salt,"I was skeptical about buying salt for $5.99 I have been impressed. This gray salt does not have the bitter aftertaste of most table salts. It is also very forgiving if you add too much. I've been using this in cooking and have recently moved the ""tub"" to the kitchen table. I'm thinking of buying a salt spoon.I like this better than a shaker since I can really see how much salt I am using. In this sense, I am able to keep my salt intake to a minimum."
2,pretty and thin,pretty pictures and pleasant anecdotes but not much else. if you are looking for something of substance you can do a lot better. a nice coffee table book but somewhat overpriced.
5,A New York Times Gift Book of the Year Selection,"""The Gardener's Life is more frankly decorative, but it, too, offers variety and charm. Without the overkill of a shelter magazine, this book integrates its floral pinups with nice old lawn-mower and picket-fence pictures, the better to dream up a well-rounded rustic fantasy.""-- Janet Maslin, The New York Times, Dec. 10, 2004"
1,Difficult to Follow,"I needed to read this book in my college English class. Needless to say, I found it very difficult to follow and did not enjoy it. In order to write my papers, I had to use Sparknotes. Even using this resource to understand the book was difficult. The class wasn't engaged in class when we discussed this book because everyone was having trouble following it. It was a very disappointing English class."
2,Way too confusing,"This is an excellant book for all those book worms out there that love to take the time to analyze every single word that they read. For the average reader that enjoys books for fun and pleasure I would not recommend this confusing book. It continually skips to different time periods and settings all throughout the story. As soon as you start to understand what is going on, Silko tricks you by going back in time. I do believe that there is an interesting message to be found but I think Silko could have done a better job keeping her readers hooked."
1,Easy to put down,When I started to read the first page I fell asleep. Its so boring and really goes on and on about nothing. Really no different then alot of stuff already out there.
1,The worst story I have ever read,"There was no story line and I felt that Tayo was a flat character. I was unable to really understand where the story was going and I'm sorry,but the people who say it was life changing are full of crap! If it was really that life changing then sweety you have no life. This book should have never been published and Leslie should really stop writing. This book has proven that Leslie has no skill and that she really should'nt be writing while being depressed. Her story truly reflected the sad state she was in. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just being honest."
4,Surprising read,A serious and special read -- highly recommended for the spirit seeker or the simply interetsed in a tale of soul searching.
3,Ceremony,I found this book to be difficult in many ways. Being in the hero's mind and re-experiencing the war events was painful to read. The jumping from reality to mythology slowed the pace of understanding. My book group had many who did not even finish the book despite the descriptions of nature that were very inspiring.
5,"Sunrise, accept this offering, sunrise","This book, the story of a Laguna Indian who returns home from World War II and finds himself estranged, confused, and sick, is a spiritual experience unto itself. The main character, Tayo, is caught between two worlds: the world of violence and drunkenness into which many young Nativa Americans plunged after the war; and the world of his ancestors, of stories and ceremonies. The book is not easy reading; I would hesitate to recommend it for children or students under 15. Although the language is simple, the frequent time shifts and metaphors demand something from the reader. This is not a book to be read passively. When read with the intent to savor every passage, however, this book will take the reader far beyond the blame game of red man versus white man, and into a world where a return to the ancient ways of indigenous people just might save us from destroying ourselves."
1,What a terrible waste of time.,"This book describes in tedious detail the many problems of a young Native American named Tayo. Even though Tayo faces such obstacles as shell shock and alcoholism, I felt no sympathy for him as I desperately waited for the book to be over. I think that Silko is meaning to addess the problems that Native Americans face, but she does so by accusing whites of being ""devils"" and ""evil spirits"" whose only goal in life is to ruin the Native Americans. My final opinion of this book is that Tayo is too pathetic to be the protagonist of an entire novel."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"This book is so lame. It couldn't hold my attention through 5 pages! It just goes on and on with Tayo's pointless flashbacks. I had to read this book for school and every kid that read it wanted to burn it. So many kids hated it, our teacher isn't going to make next years class read it. Throughout the book it will be talking about one thing and in midsentence it will change to another subject and tense. There is no plot and the whole book in general is just sooo boring. Silko blames everything that goes wrong on white people. According to the book, Indians think white people were made by witches to destroy the earth. If you have to read it for school I feel sorry for you, but if you don't have to read it please don't!"
1,awful,"The worst book I've have ever read. The story wants to be a sad, feel so sorry for the main character, but actually makes you wanna gag. Throughout the entire book I found myself confused and lost. The author portrays Tayo as such a person you have to feel pity for, but really he needs a slap in the face and tell him to stop whining. In the end the book was horrible and I recommend not to read this."
1,Ceremony- forget about it,"If you're suffering from ensomnia, I highly reccomend Ceremony. If not, avoid it altogether. The book makes no sense at all. It jumps back and forth in time and expects you to follow. It has no chapters and no clear plot. I only read it because it was required for a class. Why this book is considered so good is beyond me. Tayo, the main character, spends the majority of the book puking, and the rest of the characters are just stupid. I give it two thumbs WAY down"
5,A Must Read,Beautifully written novel focusing on Southwest Native American history and culture and psychological/cultural conflicts with larger Anglo-American society. Author helps reader to get inside the minds of the various characters and to appreciate the positive aspects of Native American culture.
3,Ceremony,"Ceremony, overall, was a pretty good book. It was quite educational even, having known little about Native American culture prior to reading it. Silko writes of the hard times Native Americans went through after WWII, their trouble on the reservations, alcoholism, etc. Tayo, the main character, struggled throughout the novel with a sort of post-war depression. It also dicussed the Native American view of White people, which I found quite intersting. This book was slightly confusing because it jumped around in terms of time period, but as the book continued it was less noticable. Overall, this a good read."
4,Speaking Out,"I can honestly say that I enjoyed this book very much, granted it was a bit difficult to understand in the beginning.Ceremony, by Leslie marion Silko deals with a half native american, half mexican young man named Tayo. He endured many hard times in his life, including being in worls war two, which in turn forced him to deal with his mental state of mind. what I mainly got from this book was that tayo was always on the outside of american culture, this also could be or is Silkos story. She wanted us to step outside of american culture and maybe see things in someones elses view or even life, as it was for them.I have to say she really does an exceptional job at it, even though the beginning frustrated me a little, she definately pulls you in, which makes you not want to put the book down, until you understand."
4,Never Thought of it That Way,"This was an interesting and saddening book. Leslie Marmon Silko brings a new perspective to American society through her main character Tayo, a Mestizo (half Native American, half Mexican) World War II verteran. In her novel, Silko challenges the principles of both Caucasians and her own Native American people while describing Native American life in the 20th century.At first glance I assumed that this would be another attack on todays Caucasians who are taking the heat for the past. However, after looking deeply into the novel, I realized that the novel is more of a critique of society rather than the people in it. Don't get me wrong, Silko gets a few good shots in on both Native Americans and Caucasians, but her overall message is delivered in a way that makes you question several things. This novel's boundaries lie exclusively in the reader's mind."
3,"Great form, weak function","Although its inentions are strong and it presents an accurate picture of a group of people that literature and history have overlooked, Ceremony, unfortunately, is unforgivingly slow-moving."
1,It's just stupid,"It's just stupid. Just don't do it. If you're thinking about reading it, just don't. Spare yourself the agony. I'd rather be in a Vietnamese prison camp than reading this again."
3,Marlene and Tayo...beloved by Honors 2002,"Tina and Sarah would just like to say that this novel is a frustration to all those in search of a correspondingly good book review, because we feel that Marlene is the sole reputable source from which we access information. The novel was a ""rare find,"" as so many other fine scholars on this website have noted. We hope that someone desperately searching for a decent review will read this, and realize it is yet another bad one. Take care, good luck, and good night."
3,Relatively good read,"I've read this book twice. The first time I read it, I didn't like it a whole lot. I was required to read it again for a class and I enjoyed much, much more the second time. The book is well written. I found it interesting how the structure of the book pretty much reflects Tayo's changing mental state, as it gets less and less eratic throughout the novel. However, one major problem I have with this novel is that Silko seems far too heavy-handed in her attempt to represent the native culture as the answer to all of Tayo's problems. There are a lot of cliche references about white culture and Silko doesn't seem to feel that it has anything to offer Tayo or any of the other characters in the novel. I felt that that this was a bit too cliche and heavy-handed for a writer of Silko's caliber."
3,"as the indie scene slowly dies, ""Nowhere"" shines","Gregg Araki is the master when it comes to expressing modern teenage nihilism in film, and ""Nowhere"" is one of his best movies to date. The large ensemble cast helps keep things interesting, and seldom is there a dull moment even though this film essentially goes...well...nowhere. Araki is in top form here, and even though some elements seem ridiculous (the space alien frying everyone), the tone is serious throughout. ""Nowhere"" speaks the truth about an uncaring, amoral generation while mainstream Hollywood thinks there's some relevance to be marketed out of ""Generation Y."""
1,Most Decadent Movie Ever,"I don't understand how so many people can praise a movie that, essentially, takes us ""Nowhere"". A goup of depressed teenagers messing up their lives, getting drunk, killing each other and themselves? It's difficult enough to live with people who think these are the only alternatives to a rational life, why do we insist on spending millions to put these things on the screen?"
2,A poor attempt to reach the mainstream....,"Nowhere is a bad movie. What happened to Gregg Araki? ""The Doom Generation"" was a cool little movie, then he makes this completely uncool movie about nothing... There are only two cool moments, 1. When the ataris steal zero's car, 2. when someone explodes, the rest sucks. But this is just me, if you like pointless teen movies, like license to drive, meatballs, or mighty ducks, then you might like this, but if you like cool movies like, trainspotting, kids, or even scream, you wont enjoy this I guarantee it..."
1,Sucks,"Absolutely the most idiotic piece of trash I've ever watched. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. Not even the cameos by former iconoclasts. I want the two hours of my life it stole back, but since that will never happen, I'll just settle for warning anyone who wishes to see a movie about wasted youth not to waste their own watching this droll MTV video."
1,HELL NO...,"This move takes on the grand journey of ... well ... NOWHERE...My sister gave me the movie too watch and i gave it an open-mind .. had some shocks here and there but then came too the conclusion ...You people are dumb ,i've been had... there isn't a messege that the title hasn't told you already , if you havn't figurerd out what the movie was going too do , check for a pulse..is the heart rate going well there sparky ... Don't waste your time or money ...that's time you will never get back that couldve been used watching something better ...God now i know i can make a movie with no real point and people will be in aw .."
2,Another boring Gregg Araki movie,"I've been watching Araki's movies lately just to see what the hype was once about...still haven't figured it out, I guess he's a good salesman and self promoter. Once again he's cast his alter-ego in another movie in which he can't figure out whether he's coming or going, gay or straight. He trys way too hard to be cool, but can't quite pull it off. I wonder what actors like Beverly D'Angelo must think after they've screened the film they've lowered their standards to appear in... Talk about the emporer's new clothes..."
1,"Tragic attempt at an ""artsy"", avante garde film.","The movie is extremely difficult to follow. The characters are all very annoying and you never care about what happens to any of them.I think that the director was trying to create a ""foreign"" movie, but missed the mark by at least the distance between here and the sun.There was no plot or character development. It was a huge waste of money. Don't buy it!!!!"
1,This movies plot went NOWHERE,"I am truely sorry for those that this will affend. This movie was a sad attempt of art on film. It was sloppy and poorly written. It perseves teenagers as sex crazed idiots! I mean really, the guy from Baywatch was a retarded touch. Are braces the new accessory or what? Almost every female sported them. And the two suicides, come on! Finding true love was a plot never quenched. DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT WATCH THIS PATHETIC MOVIE. Thank you."
2,:review your for title a enter please,"this is awful, Greg Araki is a terrible director!At least it had some cool music, if you really really must see one of his films watch 'the doom generation' over this mess. But still... both suck!"
1,0 Stars. Complete waste of time.,"This movie is so bad it defies explanation. It is not shocking. It is not artistic. There is no point to it. The character development is non-existent. The plot is non-existent. There is no coherent storyline. It does not portray any level of realism, and even if it's not supposed to portray any level of realism it doesn't even appeal to me as fantasy. I felt nothing for the characters. I was shocked to see so many seemingly legitimate actors participating in such a piece of garbage."
1,pondering,"I don't even know why I saw this movie. The Doom Generation is, in my opinion, the worst movie ever made (and I'm not the only one who believes this I can assure you). so why did I see Nowhere? Well I figuired that a director couldn't get it so completely wrong more than once. I was wrong. I'm trying hard to figuire out why so many people like this movie, it has so many scenes that are put in for shock factor that are just stupid. I really don't want to see a guys nipples ripped off. Oh, by the way this movie doesn't say anything about teenagers, I should know, I STILL AM ONE!. Yes I am 17 and I have never felt or experienced half of the things seen in this movie. So many adults want to make their teen years seem so dramatic that I think that some of them acctually believe that they really were like that. If you really want to see a good movie about growing up and the hell that it can be go check out KIDS. now that is a wake up call of a movie."
3,"Obscure, entertaining satire","The first time I saw Gregg Araki's Nowhere I absolutely hated it, but when i rewatched it, i appreciated the cast and the insult towards teens. not a great movie, but it sparked the nihilisim in ME."
4,"NOT A CLASSIC, NOT A CULT CLASSIC, BUT A REAL GOOD MOVIE;","This film has really trippy imagry and seems to have been written with a lot of heartache; it's one of my personal favorites, it comes to mind when I think about all the times I wake up with no blankets on me and I need to get inside my bed instead of simply laying on top of it...it's sad the way James Duvall's character keeps pleading Mel to accept him as her only lover yet she doesn't agree or accept. Then at the end when they exchange their final goodbyes with a simple look; it's got some social commentary about society and teenagers as well, but it's not as effective as the overral emotional mindset of the film. I would love for this to come to DVD!!!"
5,Fantastic! Very happy to find this rare dvd!!,"Being a huge fan of Gregg Araki's films, ""Nowhere"" was the ONE film that I have struggled through the years to find. FINALLY, thanks to Amazon.com, I found it and has completed my collection!! Though it's an Australian import, I have a region-free dvd player, so ZERO problems with viewing this wonderful film.For those who love ""underground"" films, this is a ""must-see"".Very happy with the shipment. It arrived WAY earlier than expected and was sealed and completely brand new, which I loved.Wish I could give this TEN stars!!Thanks for providing this. You'll never know how grateful that I am for this.(Think I might watch it again, now, after talking about it. LOL)"
3,so very araki,"This was a really good movie, at times it was difficult to follow. I only saw it once and that was a while ago but i can still see it quite vividly in my head. I say Doom Generation is better, but I like the sci-fi twist in Nowhere."
5,An Offbeat Dreamer's Dream,"A teen angst movie that can be described by nothing more then a Gregg Araki movie. It fallows the guide lines of sex,drugs,whatever?? A brillant cast with manny suprises of poeple you haven't seen in years. Araki's multi layered movies has your eyes glued to the tv wondering what are you ganna see next. Brillant form of imagination when it comes to the characters names such as Dark,Zero,Cowboy ect. Also the way the characters rooms are decoraded. Nowhere lived up to everything that i expected it to be and when you get down to it the story is about an innocent kid lost with his life his sexuality his future and just wants everything to be ok. Happyness doesn't always come cheep i think that is what Dark Smith is learning in this film. It's an affectionate,sad,sexy film i give it 5 stars for araki's magor use of imagination !"
2,"This film goes ""NOWHERE""","I'm an independent/quirky-film buff, so a small movie like this has to be bad for me not to like it.This movie was pointless from start to end. If you like weird looking aliens and bumbling twentysomethings doing nothing interesting, then go ahead and watch this boring movie."
3,TEENS? Gimme a break!!!,"Rachel True is in her mid FORTIES. This film is 13 years old. She was 28-32 while playing a ""teen"". That's almost as ridiculous as Shari Belafonte playing a H.S. girl in the early Eighties when SHE was 34!!!!!!!!"
5,One of my favorites,"Shocking portrayal of teen angst and lust done by some of America's most famous teen icons. PUNK ROCK! If you're into sex, drugs, music, or just cult movies of that sort, view this independent gem. This film has so many cameo's it'll make your head spin. John Ritter as the televangalist is CLASSIC. The humor is well-worn, but it's wittingly done. Psychosomatic sexuality and imagery prevail here. Where? Nowhere. But alot closer than you'd like to admit YOU FREAK. So go pick this up and stop floggin your puppy in the shower!"
2,Is Araki out of film school yet?,"If you gave your average college kid a relatively big budget for a final project in film class, this is about what the result would be. A whole movie about amoral druggie sex-starved teens partying all night? Wow, what an original concept. Whenever Araki wants to disguise his lack of talent, he throws a space alien or some guy with a dead dog on the screen-- you know, the sort of random visuals that pretend to be ""alternative"" but that anyone with thirty seconds and half a brain could come up with. The only reason that this movie doesn't get one star is that it occasionally has a good one-liner and John Ritter is fantastic in a brief cameo. But that isn't enough to make this a film worth spending your money on."
5,How Much Cooler Could One Movie Get!,This was a great film. Absolutely amazing. It had so many levels. It was so COOL! I'll never watch those Baywatch repeats the same way again.
3,Well!,"It's weird, but fresh to me. I didn't quite understand what is this movie about. Gregg araki is one of my favorite film directors, I've been liked his movie since I saw one of his greatest movies,'Doom Generation'. 'Nowhere' is also extraordinary movie like araki's other films. But, I don't really suggest this movie to the people who are big huge fan of movie like 'clueless'."
5,This is not just a cookbook......,"It tells the story about a truly inspirational family and their famous vineyard that spans virtually the entire twentieth century. It tells a story about the history of the Bandol apellation. It tells a story about each of the seasons living life in and around the vineyard; the food, the vineyard, the weather, the wine and the types of meals and celebrations that accompany them.And then it is a cookbook. And then the recipes have context and you then know why you want to cook them and you imagine sitting down to dinner with Lulu and her family just one time (and speaking french) and even helping out in the kitchen.So it is not just a cookbook... it is a really great dream about living and loving and cooking and eating in an amazing place surrounded by amazing people who grow grapes and make terrific wine and celebrate life each and every day."
4,Read size info.,"The earrings are gorgeous, but they are too larege for my earlobes. I would like them in a necklace for myself. Stones are very nice."
1,Exhausted capacity quickly,I always depleted the battery down before recharging. All conscientious efforts did not matter. The battery quickly wore down to only 8 minutes of function. Now it can only function for less than 10 seconds.
5,Lamp Repair,"This is the best little repair kit for lamps that I have ever used, everything fit so perfect and for an excellent price. You can't beat it."
4,5 years and saying goodbye.,"Pros:I bought this card in 2007. The card has been very good to me. Many hours of gaming have gone though this guy.I can still play some of the top games with decent graph settings turn up. It's not the best graphic settings, but the games are smooth and still look wonderful.Now here is the bad...kind of...Cons:My card is on it's last leg. It started flaking out about 4 months ago. My screen would turn a bit pink and crash my computer.I have baked my card now for the second time. Yes, in the oven for 10 minutes @ 200-250. This has fixed it both times, but alas I know this card is heading towards the light.On a side note. I think the card is overprice for being 5 years old. Considering I bought it for $130 5 years ago, but hey maybe I spent to much 5 years ago."
4,No problems,"The mediocre video card which came with my HP Pavilion m8120n gave my Vista PC a Windows Experience Index graphics score of only 3.3 (out of a possible 5.9). Installing the PNY GeForce 8600GT video card was relatively easy. The PNY card was much larger than the OEM card which required rerouting one pesky cable under the card rather than over it.I haven't experienced any of the negative issues reported by the other two reviewers. The good news is my PC now scores 5.9 for desktop graphics performance and 5.5 for gaming performance. The bad news is I haven't noticed any change, better or worse, in my PC's performance since installing the 8600GT. Since I don't use my PC for playing games, perhaps my normal usage didn't require a more powerful video card."
2,Nearly burned itself out,Installed the product ok. It came with a PNY sticker on the fan. well the sticker was off center and after a few hours of use the fan would start making funny noises and eventually the computer shut down. This went a few times and then the sticker fell off from the heat and havent had the problem since.PNY Tech support was positively attrocious in getting replies to my issue and I still havent heard back on getting a new card as I think the heating issue has damaged this one to an extent.
2,Fast performance but problematic sometimes,"I buy this graphic card 1 year ago, the instalation is very simple, the performance is great (sometimes). but this card comes with a few problems, it crashes my pc, the screen shows an error message about a graphic problem. so when this happend i have to rebot my computer.don't buy this thing, its a waste of money"
2,BC-20 Cartridges,"Over the years I have used about a dozen BC-20 ink jet cartridges. They do not refill well, so I gave up early on that approach to economy. I have had two new cartridges that were dry right out of the box, and one that was electrically non-functional. I try to buy these things as cheaply as I can because I figure one out of four will not work. However, when they do work, they are excellent and last a looong time."
2,Disapointed,"Book #2 in my read through the Hugo's. While I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Demolished Man"" by Alfred Bester, this novel comes across as being way too preachy. Seeking a telepathic companion, Joe Carter orchastrates the building of the first super-computer, named Bossy, that has the ability to renew mankind. Wash away their prejudices and preconcieved notions. And, I guess in the view of the authors, create a race of zombies with no convictions. Skip this one if you're looking for classic Sci-Fi."
5,Typical novel of the fifties,"This book was originaly called :""They'd rather be right"" and won Hugo in 1955.The book is typical for those years. The idea is simple: We created something new and of course we do not know what to do next. Should we destroy it or should we worship it or maybe it's just something that should make everybody's lives better? .The book answer those questions and more. If you do not read much science fiction or read only the NEW ""STUFF"" and you do not usually use your brains , this book is not for you. You would not simply understand why this book was in top twelve most important Sci-fi books ever. However, if you like to think for a change and like the genre, read it and you will not be disappointed."
5,The Book of Me,"I gave this book as Christmas Gifts this year and the recipients were thrilled when they saw the guidance, prompts, depths of the questions, and corresponding web sites.."
2,Interesting,"The author makes some interesting observations, especially emphasizing the importance of the communal celebration of the sacraments and not just viewing them as something the individual receives. He also makes a strong case for the importance of the narrative aspect.However I have a problem seeing the book as a trustworthy guide due to some of the author's suggestions which seem at odds with the Catholic Church's traditional and moral teachings. He disputes Augustine's teachings on infant baptism, offers a case for pre-marital co-habitation and calls into question the validity of a child's first confession made prior to first holy communion. So I can't recommend this as an orthodox guide to sacramental theology, despite many great insights."
4,Another really good Bosstones album,"While this is easily the Bosstones most well known album I do not believe it is there best (personally I think the best album was Don't Know How to Party). with that being siad this is still a really good album with some awesome songs. While some of this album is hit a miss with me I think the good outweighs tha not so good. Songs like Rascal King, Royal Oil, obviously The Impressiong That I Get, and Numbered Days all are fantastic and are still as good now over 10 years after the albums realease. I would say this is a must own for any Bosstones fan or a ska fan"
5,Brilliant !,"Not just one of the greatest albums by the Bosstones, but one of the best albums I have (and I have many). Great fast-paced musicianship mixed with very intelligent lyrics. Moreover, many songs have a great moral, not mindless drivel. ""Break So Easy"" and ""Numbered Days"" immediatley jump to mind as just a few of the great songs on this CD. I can't imagine anybody not liking this album, or really not liking any of their albums. Great band!"
4,Good Ska. I like it.,"I bought this album around this time last year because I heard the song ""Royal Oil"" and I liked their other songs so I said hey, I might as well get the album because it was in my head all night for days until I got it. When I got it I instantly fell in love with it. It is a great Ska album, it has elements of Punk too, but I just feel good when I listen to this album, needless to say THIS IS A FEEL GOOD ALBUM, it will make you feel happy. I NJOI all the songs on the album. They're cool. MIGHTY MIGHTY BABY!"
5,Ska at it's best,"Considered by many to be the band's greatest album, ""Let's Face It"" is full of extremely catchy songs like ""The Impression That I Get"". This album is great fr ska, punk, and reggae fans. Parents, I would deem this acceptable for ages 13 and up."
5,This music is going under your skin,"First time I`ve heard the MMB`s I was surprised because in Austria we don`t have music like this. But I think we do have lot of people which will love it. I`m listening the MMB`s since summer 97 when I was in the US. I`ve never heard about them before, but i will never ever miss them again."
4,Clever lyrics are the key.,"I don't know if this is a typical CD from The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (my first one) but the quality of the lyrics made me want to check out others. The Ska beat is partnered with some clever commentary on race relations (""Let's Face It"") and violence in our daily lives (""Nevermind Me"" Numbered Days"")They appear to be a band willing to try to say something while not forgetting to entertain. A rare combination in today's music."
3,"some good, some not",This is a very good CD. The only reason i got it though was because it was $.99 in a columbia house magazine. The first 5 songs are what you'd expect from a bosstones CD. the rest are almost hard rock. My favorites are The Rascal King and The Impression That I Get. It is a very good CD though
1,Does Not Age Well,"""Let's Face It"" has some deceptively catchy tunes. ""The Impression That I Get"" was a novelty hit which actually received radio play, something unusual for the Bosstones. Unfortunately, they bled the formula dry; all the songs on the album sound the same. This is the type of CD you may listen to in your car five times and then never pick up again. If you must own this album, try visiting a used record store--that's where my copy is.To be fair, this CD is not without *some* redeeming qualities: several friends have used ""Let's Face It"" as a practical and attractive coaster."
4,"It's not old Bosstones, but it's still great","Don't be too quick to judge an album if a band cools down a little. I'll admit, I prefer ""Don't know how to party"" over this, but this still has some great songs. The real standout tracks on this cd are ""Rascal king,"" ""Break so easily"" and ""Another drinkin' song,"" which starts out slow, but works its way up to a catchy tune. The only mediocre songs on this are ""Let's face it"" and ""Desensitized."" Nate Albert continues to be one of ska's most creative guitarists, and Dicky's voice is still plenty scratchy. Plus, I'm sure any fan of old bosstones could appreciate the thrash-ska of ""1-2-8."""
4,Great Cd if you aren't a huge fan of SKA,"Now i only bought this CD becuase i liked ""the impression that i get"". After like 1 week, every song was amazing. Now if you're a huge SKA fan, it might not be that good for you. This Album Mixes Ska With rock. If you just want to hear some decent SKA, Buy this Album. This album gets you into a good mood. The songs are very peppy."
2,Just not the Bosstones I knew,"It seems like alternative music is dead, and this Bosstones album just reinforced that idea. Every band seems to be into the pop scene these days, and the Bosstones unfortunately pushed their music more towards that genre. Where have you gone, music of the early to mid 90's? Buy yourself some old Bosstones Cd's instead."
2,The Worst of the Bosstones,"This CD was the first I ever heard of the Bosstones, and my first impression was that it was decent. But as soon as I heard their older stuff, I realized just how terrible this album is. They've totally sold out, and most of these songs are agonizing. You want a good Bosstones cd? Get ""More Noise and other disturbances,"" not this garbage."
5,STILL GOT IT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!!!,THE ALBUM IS EXCELLENT. THE VOCALS ARE GREAT!!! IF YOU'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED RICKY BEFORE YOU HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT!!!
5,Definitely Ch'uchy!!!!!,"This CD is ooofff the hook!!!! Ricky Dillard did it again!!!! I love the album because the title fits it perfectly, it goes back to the way church used to be!!!!( and still is ) It's definitely a hand clappin', foot stompin' and shoutin' project."
4,Shows promise,"I admit that I compare all guitarists to Michael Hedges. In that shadow, most fail. Young, however, shows amazing potential. His style has an aggressive--usually--feel to it that reminds you the sound is coming from wood and steel. Unfortunately, some songs fall flat and even approach horrible. One song--you'll know it when you hear it--has such a loud amplification of fingers scraping up the strings that it is unbearable until about a minute into the song. What comes after that acoustic sacrilege comes a GREAT song. This album is a real roller coaster ride. Luckily, with modern audio equipment, you can just skip to the parts you like . . . and there are many parts to like. Definitely worth buying!"
3,Perfect summertime yoga rug - but hard to wash,"The rug is perfectly designed. Once it's a little damp, traction is excellent. The rug is a little wider than an average yoga mat, which helps you stake out more territory in a tight studio. The area where your hands and feet end up in down-dog are a bit thicker and grippier.Any yoga rug, this included, is little hard to wash on a regular basis, and that's really the only drawback. It takes about a day to air dry after washing, and it's a bit to bulky and stiff to clean and dry in a machine. I can't imagine any worthwhile yoga rug being any better in this regard though. It's just a downside of rugs versus mats.I love this rug during the summer months when I sweat too much to use any of the mats comfortably. The rug works perfectly when I'd be sliding all over the mats."
5,Classical rock by progressive masters,Showcases the depth of this trio. The classical roots of Keith Emerson combine with the writing talent of Greg Lake and the power of Carl Palmer....
1,Unplayable,"When I buy a used album, I know I'm taking a risk. Most of the time it works out, but not this time. There are so many scratches that the music is ruined. Oh well, perhaps next time."
5,"Weekender Hammock, Tangelo",I am very happy with this product and was pleased that it arrived in 4 days because it was a Christmas present. I appreciated the fact that it was free shipping and arrived so promptly.
5,Wonderful young-adult/teen book!,"Oh, does this book brings back memories! It was a favorite growing up and was read so many times I nearly wore it out.It is the story of a late teenage boy earning the chance to intern one summer at a marine research center in Hawaii and having the opportunity to dive and work in the beautiful waters around the islands. There are teens from around the US and the islands who work at the center each summer and compete for top honors. The central theme of life in and around the water and its risks comes through as the kids fight to meet the challenge set by the adults running the center.It's a great story with excitement, risk, adventure, and even a smattering of teen romance thrown into the mix. This book almost guided me into a marine biology career. To this day, I still have my dive card and love to get wet!"
5,OXO Good Grips 1066522 Black Steel Trash Can,I am enjoying this trash can. I can leave the lid up when I'm working in the kitchen but can then close it off when I leave. The design is sleek. You can even decorate it with magnets and pictures if you want because it's steel. I also feel like I'm emptying my trash less. It's pretty large yet uses standard large trash bags. It is just such an improvement over my last plastic garbage can. And it looks awesome with my new black appliances.
2,i hate philosphy,"this book is good if you want what the person actually said. but if your an idiot like meee then you wont be able to understand it. I liked the Buddha, Martin Luther King, Dalai Lama and Dave Wong. I hated the rest w.e screw them."
3,The surreal world of stop-motion survival,"Not as inspired as Raney, but a decent summer read. You probably need to have a sympathy for what at-risk students become as grownups. You'll feel like you got a glimpse of their own peculiar logic. The dog is charmless."
4,Pretty near as good as Mattie's home cookin',"Personally, I liked Raney and Walking Across Egypt better than this one, but it's still pretty damn good. Wesley , the delinquent sort of adopted by Mrs. Mattie Rigsbee in Walking Across Egypt, is now 24, and still a bit of a handful. He's a resident in a Christian halfway house in rural North Carolina. There's a love interest, a band, and there's Vernon, who 'bout steals the show when he appears on the page. And of course Mattie herself, who is older still but still cooking up a storm.Good story, great author; sequel to follow, surely."
3,a spinoff with less oomph than Walking Across Egypt,"If you've not read Edgarton's Walking Across Egypt, forget this and go read that. Then read this if you want, but know that WAE is better. WAE is an engaging and warm read; its sequel, Diller, is okay but a little weaker and more forgettable.WAE centers on a lovable, interesting, cozy old woman and her community; Diller centers on a lovable delinquent young man and his community. (The two characters are in both books. Their worlds intersect.) WAE made more of an impression on me, but this one is not a bad story to while away some hours with."
3,"Good Book, Bad Reader","Frederick Davidson manages to nearly ruin what is otherwise a perfectly good Jeeves story with his sneering, supercilious delivery. Bertie Wooster should never sound like an arrogant snob, nor should Jeeves sound like John Carradine at his most sinister.The book ""Jeeves and the Tie That Binds"" is Wodehouse in good form, with an interesting plot and a good handful of pithy one-liners, if a -little- too much reliance on running gags and the ""if X is the word I want"" bit. This one is also particularly notable in the Jeeves/Wooster canon for containing the ultimate fate of Madeline Bassett and what is probably Jeeves' highest tribute of devotion to his employer (but I won't spoil it for you).In short, get the print edition of ""Jeeves and the Tie That Binds,"" and avoid this unfortunate rendition. For audio presentation of Jeeves stories, you're best sticking to Jonathan Cecil for reading duties, for his fizzy and nicely-varied presentation."
2,Tough to follow,This book was tough to follow and did really go anywhere. I felt like it was a jumbled piece of work that had no storyline or plot.
3,Frightening,"Erich Fromm was not the World's Greatest Writer, nor was he the World's Greatest Historian. However, he did manage to write some pretty interesting books, one of which is ""Escape from Freedom,"" perhaps his most famous. The idea behind the work; that man will seek comfort from the burdens from responsibility, even if it takes the form of a dictator, is an extremely intriguing one, and one which becomes ever more appalling with each successive dictator that crops up somewhere in the world. There are some factual mistakes in this book (Fromm tries to attribute the roots of this phenomenon to specific time periods, when such thoughts were present in far earlier literary works), and it can be somewhat repetitive at times. However, ""Escape From Freedom"" is nontheless an extremely intriguing read that I would recommend to anyone unafraid to consider some pretty frightening ideas."
4,EXCELLENT ANALYSIS OF MODERN INHUMANITY AND ITS ROUTES,"This book analyzes the origins of controlling and submissive personalities, in their being by-products of an alienated existence, and meant to overcome the uncertainty and loneliness that results, through the means of symbiosis with another human being. He shows that people are confronted with the contsant no-win situation of choosing between submission and submersion or aloneness and insecurity. Of course, he DOES pose a SOLUTION to this problem, that of a productive, creative, spontaneous, social personality. Needless to say this personality is incompatible with modern day capitalistic society, despite a possible extreme minority. If we want to be free and secure, the only solution is interconnectedness, and to live in a HUMAN society. THIS is what Fromm teaches us."
4,good insights into totalitarianism,"I'm not the most intellectual of thinkers, or the best suited to evaluate a book like this, but because we live in a democracy and I'm allowed to express my opinion, I think I will. I found this study of totalitarian systems interesting, if not always convincing because of so much psycho-babble thrown in. But this book shows how some people feel alienated and dehumanized and ""left behind"" in a democracy, and how such people are willing to submit to the fascist idea of a government and ruler who claims to care about them and taking care of their concerns rather than a dog-eat-dog ""free society"" where like in no other society you're left to fend for yourself. This book is a criticism of democracy's dangers, as well as the dangers that bring about oppressive autocratic rule. Recommended for those who like to read psychology and sociology.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""
5,Trip back in time,"I attended the 1982 Pooh Palasport concert in Udine as a teenager. This CD brought back many memories of that time. Great music, great band. You don't have to know Italian to appreciate the fine quality of the melodies."
4,From the 104th Floor,"Leda Rodis' young life included one of the most horrific events of our day, 9/11. She took the events and wrote about it in such a way as to move the heart and soul. Serguei Bassine then added his expertise in filmmaking to immortalize Leda's work. No one who lived through the events of 9/11 will ever be the same, but this poem and DVD helps us see that in the end love conquers and that we always have choices, even if it is only in the way we die."
5,Great looking stand but,Good looking and very functional. Had no problems with them since getting them set up.
1,"Cheap, tacky, overpriced junk","I saw a chain just like this in Claire's the other day. It cost $15, and I'd bet any amount of money that it would last longer than Hilton's line - and this is from a store known for its cheaply-made costume jewelry.Guess what, girls? A 3-and-a-half-foot long sterling silver chain with glued-on ""crystals"" (read: cubic zirconia at best, plastic at worst) doesn't cost $95 to produce. It costs maybe - maybe! - $10, and that's assuming the factory's in the US. Don't throw any more of your money away. Why mothers would even allow, let alone encourage, their teenage daughters to idolize a trashy, spoiled, vapid waste of space like Paris Hilton is beyond me."
1,WAY overpriced peice of JUNK,"Honestly, who wants to hang a chain around their waist? No, seriously? Can you imagine how that would even FEEL?! Ugh, to me, this is the biggest waste of money if i've ever seen one. 100 dollars of CRAP!! You can buy those fake rhinestones in the craft store, stick them around your waist, and they'd look just the same, not only cost about, hm, FIVE DOLLARS, at the most!!! Don't buy this, it's honestly a COMPLETE waist of money."
1,Carver Guide Not worth the price,This tiny booklet is not worth the $14 price. There isn't sufficient help within to really make a difference although it has a very catchy title.
4,Kushy Tushy toilet seat,"High quality product. A bit firmer than those in stores and more expensive. But so nicely made with metal hinges, so i believe it will last much longer than them."
1,kushy tushy toilet seat,"i purchased the Kushy Tushy toilet seat about a year ago ,thinking it was a high end product that would last ! it split in a few places and is falling apart.. the material they use is actually pealing off - when you pay $54-$64 for a toilet seat, it shouldnt fall apart!"
5,A comic? A novel? Both.,It's amazing how this book reads like most novels out there. Only this is better than 99% of novels out there. I re-read it from cover to cover several times and I'd read it again. Can you say the same about most books in your bookstore? Don't miss this.
5,so good!,"what an engaging read!i was so excited to find a big graphic novel (600 some odd pages). it's so easy to whip through graphic novels, that it's difficult for me to part with 15+ dollars to read something i know i'll finish in an hour.of course it wasn't the size that held my attention. 'box office poison' is riveting. robinson invites us into the world he has created, and let's us get to know the character's. it's so easy to know these people, never having met them!the story focuses on a guy that works in a bookstore, and another who wants to be a comic book writer. they interact with a variety of character's so real and engaging, you can almost hear them breathing.robinson is a talent to watch! i cannot wait until he writes another book!this is highly, highly recommended reading!"
2,Lacking feeling.,"There is something wrong with this book. There are many characters that should be interesting, who have interesting situations and back-stories, but they act like paper cut-outs. This book is boring. There is no spark in it, no life or soul or whatever you might call it. Everything in this book just generally falls flat, in my humble opinion."
2,I was surprised...,"...that this book made so many year-end lists as one of the best novels of 2003. The story, while having a great premise, is marred by one-dimensional characters and a protagonist (telling her side of the story first-hand) I could never feel much affinity toward. One the plus side, it's a quick read, great for airplanes and beaches. I just thought it would be a little meatier (yuk yuk)."
3,takes itself too seriously,"I found ""My Year of Meats"" searching through books being taught in UCLA English courses. It was one of the best books I read last year. The characters, entertwined in a brilliantly constructed plot, are vibrant and believable; their story gets you totally hooked on the political subject matter and outcome of the book. ""All Over Creation"" however seems dominated by a preachy political agenda at the expense of good story-telling. The device of developing Yumi in first-person, then third-person, even the ""You"" narrative from chapter to chapter feels like it's trying too hard to elicit feelings for a character who seems too self-important to begin with and just becomes more and more annoying. The scenes feel tacked together, as if they don't really matter, and the dialogue is awkward and forced. Considering how well written (and non-preachy) ""My Year of Meats"" is, this is a really surprising let-down."
2,A failed attempt at a sequel,"To me this book feels like a failed attempt to recreate the wonderful ""My Year of Meats"".It seems to have the same ingredients: environmental issues, feminine issues, leading characters with similar backgrounds, whacky supporting cast.Unfortunately, this is not enough. The glue, the magic and most of the sharp humor of ""Meats"" is not there.The result is a boring book and a huge disappointment."
3,I was compelled to finish this book.,"I was excited to find this book at the library because I very much enjoyed Ruth Ozeki's first book (My Year of Meats). The beginning was kind of fragmented, as there were quite a few characters to introduce, but I stayed with it.Ultimately I was glad that I did, since the book was very enjoyable. But I had complicated emotions about Yumi, the main character. At least, I *think* she was the main character. At any rate, I didn't really care for her very much. Since she was central to so many lives, there was no escaping her. But I genuinely liked Cass, the girl next door. Well, liked and pitied.But anyway (!), I did finish the book and look forward to a third from this author. Overall I really like her style.I rated this book 3 out of a possible 5 stars, because the end seemed to drag. Otherwise it would have been a solid 4."
4,My Year of Spuds,"If you gave up eating meat after Ozeki's last book/anti-carnivore treatise, then prepare to go organo-vegan with this thoroughly enjoyable romp. The jacket reviews say it's about nature's continual capacity for rebirth, and that's certainly the underlying theme, lesser motifs include the perils of starting smoking again, and that America has a crusty movement too- they just say ""dude"" more."
2,"Science is good...fiction, not so much","Like a lot of people, I found the information genetic modification of food pretty compelling. However, the fiction format was less than entertaining.Since plenty of other people have summarized the book for you, I won't go in to that. Instead, I'll tell you what I liked and disliked:LIKES - easy read; a few memorable characters; interesting notes on biodiversity and heirloom seedsDISLIKES - storyline; apparent main character (Yumi / Yummy); attempt to intertwine each and every character; overall, too contrived."
4,Well worth a look,"Very engaging book with a good blend of the personal and the political.Interesting characters and a strong sense of pacing and drama to keep, and hold, your interest.I also admired the way Ozeki alternated, from one section/chapter to the next among different characters' viewpoints and first and 3rd person and among past and ""current"" events; all this added to the layering of detail and the insights.Unlike some authors, Ozeki is not shy about showing her character's ""warts"" and complexities, their likeable side and their cranky, difficult side.I also recommend Ozeki's ""My Year of Meats"" -- as well as a look at her Web site and her blog."
4,Written by an amazingly talented woman,"I was lucky enough to have this author as an English professor in college. She is insightful, intelligent, and incredibly talented. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for a definitive Hawthorne resource."
5,STAR POWER!!,"This Movie is Star Power! Some actors have pass. The Great Rosalind Cash, Ron Oneal and Paul Winfield are Magnificent in this Timeless Powerful Movie. It is a Real Treasure."
3,"OK, not great but better than the movie titled ......W, a lesbian flick","OK, killing lots of slow type zombies, nice guns. unbelievable parts include a civilian female carrying a ruger .22 when plenty of AK47s are laying all around and a female infantryman with hair hanging down almost to her belt, like that will not get tangled in the brush. also thinks she is a ninja, ha. guess they had to put her in for the PC types. Most important info about the movie, NO BOOBS SHOWN."
3,It was okay,"Interesting concept of having Ben Laden be a Zombie. Zombies were ok. Not a superb movie, but not horrible either"
2,Bloated,"Where is the band I used to know. When I first heard Space Wrangler--I was sucked in to this band and proceeded to go to as many of their shows as possible. They had an amazing sound with such songs as Driving Song--which is still one of the most amazing tunes I know--but just as in their live shows their releases, save Everyday, have gotten worse."
4,A good guidebook for a short trip,"I used this book for a recent 3-day trip to Lisbon. The maps in the back are really helpful, but the info in here wasn't as good as other books in this series. It made it difficult to really get a coherent sense of the area before arriving. Still, it makes a good reference for a short trip and the small size makes it great for carrying around."
5,The BEST equipment I have seen yet during an outdoor investigation,"I gave this documentary 5 stars because it is different than any other graveyard investigation I has seen. The equipment is high tech, and they install it right over the grave sites. The evidence is clear and spooky as hell! I detect a native american paranormal connection to this investigation. The EVP's sound like native american chanting. The historical site also has pioneer and native clashes attached to it. The house was built in the wrong place! Very cool!"
2,Interesting technology in this one but not paranormal,"Beautiful scenery but nothing paranormal in this one either. Just like my other two reviews, this is boring!! I would like to see this technology used with a real paranormal group not backyard ghost hunters. There is a definite connection with this group, cemetery's. It is interesting how the orbs only light up in front not all around like a self lighting orb should. I give this one two stars because of the interesting technology but nothing paranormal about this one either."
3,So-so,I thought it was OK. Had some good information on the fishfinder but left out a lot of useful things that could help my fishing career.
2,Sounds Awful,"I've been using this pickup with the Fishman G-II preamp for months and have little good to say about it. I simply cannot get the pickup to sound good on my instrument. In order to make it bearable I have to turn the treble nearly as low as possible, otherwise all that comes out is high pitched bow scraping noise. In addition, the carpenter jack is poorly designed and will not fit in my violin case. I have to attach and remove the pickup each time I use it. It The best thing about the pickup is that it is very easy to install. While it does the job of amplifying my violin, I cannot recommend this pickup for a violinist serious about tone. There simply must be better options out there."
2,Inconsistent sound,"Fishman V200 Professional Violin PickupI am using this pickup thru a preamp, and it does sound awful, it has the potential to sound good, the problem is inconsistency; As soon as you move the PU one nanometer, the sound, tone and impedance is all different.Very hard to maintain, didn't like it's sound. sounds ""piezoish"" like all other piezos in the market.Would love to hear about a PU (even bridge PU - must be feedback resistable) that has better results as far is it concerns ""acoustic tone""."
5,not enough time,there wasn't enought time for hutchence who took his life at such a young age. this album is quite way to go out though. extreme funk mixed with the style that only michael could give.
4,Catchy Final Slice of INXS,"INXS seemed somewhat rejuvenated on this album, and it shows throughout. Michael Hutchense keeps himself reined in (well, reined in for Michael Hutchense), which keeps the album from sounding too self-involved. The title track (funky and catchy) remains my highlight, even if a friend insisted they were singing ""I'm better than Oasis"". ""Girl on Fire"" has a great horn section, and the gospelesque ""Don't Lose Your Head"" is quite good, but it made me think of Deep Purple's ""Hush"". In fact, many of these tracks wouldn't be out of place on classic rock albums of the 60s and 70s. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wonder if they listened to their favorite albums (especially the Stones) before entering the studio. Still, they manage to pull it off more often than not. No really bum tracks here, just several that don't make much impression (""Show Me"", ""I'm Just a Man""). A short running time makes the whole package go down a lot smoother, too."
4,Never tear this one apart - it rocks,The Aussie rockers' swansong is undoubtably their most cohesive effort since the anthematic rythms of Kick. Just a Man' has to be the band's most emotive piece since 'Never Tear Us Apart' while 'Cherry Baby' and the title track hark back to the glory days of 'Suicide Blonde' and 'Disappear'. It's just a crying shame that the best band to come out of Australia since MIdnight Oil will do exactly that - disappear.
4,Still Hopeful,"Although retired, I am still very interested in educational matters. From time to time I receive calls/e-mails from teachers asking for help. Most of this book is aimed toward inner-city or larger schools. The good thing is that many of these techniques can be adapted to small, rural schools."
2,Not what it claims to be,This is more an attempt at inspiring teachers than a how-to book with actually practical suggestions. Only taking away one pre-reading tip and one discipline tip.Bottom line: Not worth buying. Check it out from the library instead if you are really curious.
5,Great product,This was just as describe. Will buy again if needed. 5 star rating. Received in a timely fashion and exactly what I needed.Highly recommend!!
1,A Complete Waste,"I thought this book was something so different so maybe that's my fault. I was thinking that it would be about brain based learning and NEW techniques to have students become creative thinkers. But as I was reading the book I found myself checking to find out what year the book was written. This book was not interesting, not worth my time, not worth the money. It seems to be for people who are CONSIDERING teaching and certainly has nothing to offer for someone who is already in the classroom. If you have been in the classroom for a year don't even bother with this book. It's not going to help you improve your practice in any way and there are a TON of much better books out there. This book is a complete waste."
1,Worst Education Book,"I purchased this book last year along with quite a few others. I started to read it and the book seemed like it was written in the 1950's. There was nothing new the author had to share. If you've been teaching in the last decade you already know the information presented. Save your money, I literally threw this book away, and I've never done that before."
5,Review of Teaching Outside the Box,The book arrived in excellent condition very promptly. I would use this person again.
5,An Overlooked Classic,"Joseph Priestley is one of the greatest intellectual figures of modern times. However, he should be remembered for more than just his great discoveries in the realm of science. His ""Essay on the First Principles of Government"" is a brilliant libertarian piece based on natural rights philosophy. He is a strong enemy of both established religion and public schooling. His eloquent advocacy of these positions as well as ""freedom of thought"" as a whole is still very much relevant today. It is a shame that his works have been so overlooked in recent times. This work is yet another example of how the wisdom of the 18th century is far greater than that of the 20th in many fields, most importantly political philosophy."
5,"Another ""Lousy Actor""","Oh Jack Hoxie, if only they had stayed with Silent movies instead of sound, you would have been Great. This is however an excellent western and Jack Hoxie was quite a cowboy, however once sound came into being he quickly faded into the sunset. But I do recommend this movie and it's also a very nice print.Another Thank You to Sinister Cinema."
2,"""Casual Thinking""","Man Ray is a band with an identity crisis. They sound like they would have rocked harder and more precisely, had Grunge never existed. But, it did, so they had to ""dumb down"" their sound and make it ""rough around the edges"" so it would be more accessible to the general public. This lack of trueness to one's self is evident in many bands of the post-Nirvana '90s. Candlebox is a prime example. They would have sounded like Skid Row, were they honest and courageous and had simply done what came naturally. Unwittingly, these bands paved the way for acts that were genuinely polished, yet ""rough around the edges"" such as Our Lady Peace or Matchbox Twenty. So do we ridicule them for their lack of integrity, or thank them for inadvertently spawning a popular genre? Either way, I didn't really enjoy this record. Thanks mainly to the vocalist and his ""lyrics"". The lead guitarist has excellent tone, though, and there are some solid, inspired moments, though not enough to genuinely impress me."
5,Love it!,"I have not had one problem with this radar detector. I love that it has 3 different settings as to how bright/dim the light is on the detector. Bright, dim, and none at all.I also love the fact that so far, it hasn't failed me...which is very important!I give it 2 thumbs up!"
3,"ok, but beware",The lights indicating how far and intense was the radar went off a couple of months after buying it. My husband and I already have a ticket because it did not alert about the radar. (I had a ticket for 6 miles over the speed limit) We live in North Florida = State police = squeeze all the money you can from the people. Spend a little bit more and buy a better one.
5,A laugh out loud read,"Being a 'repeat offender' to Hedonism II, I treasured the first edition as an often reread book. The tales of the zany antics of both guests and staff alike made this book hard to put down.If it is possible this second edition is far better than the first. The author describes it quite accurately, and I quote, ""Warning: Don't sip a soda pop while reading this book. The bubbles will burn your nostrils as the drink shoots out your nose""."
5,Honest/Funny look at Hedo ll,"This is an honest and hilarious look at the Hedonism II resort in Jamaica. I've done Club Med and was wondering what Hedo would be like. This gave me all the info I could possibly need, maybe more. I still don't know if I'll ever go, though the no-additional-charge Scuba diving is a big draw for me. Also don't know if getting nekkid is for me either, but this seems like a good place to go if you'd like to find out. Chris gives an insider's eye view of the resort, warts and all, that can't be found anywhere else. Her sharp sense of humor and adept observations make you feel as if you were right there with her.Thanks, Chris, it was a great read."
3,"Lightweight, but nothing compared to Nike Air","Adidas released literature correctly states that this is a entry level running shoe. What that really translates into realspeak is that this a light shoe, moderately cusioned but nowhere close to running shoes you would enjoy running with. I have used Nike Air Monarch's (I brought them for a little over $35 a couple of years back) and they are much better (cusion'er, jumpier) than these.Go for them if you want simple walking shoes...go for air if you want nice running shoes."
4,Story of a Great Man,"Helvecio Martins is a true pioneer. One of the most influential converts ever made for the LDS Church in South America, he also became the first General Authority of African descent in the Church. The story of the conversion and early Church service of this man is just incredible.This is a must read for anyone fascinated by the phenomenal growth of the LDS Church over the past quarter century."
4,you have no idea,"found this lovely bit of stuff on my friend's taped copy of her friend's cd. bought my own, used and perfect. apparently there were record company feuds, but there is a new album somewhere. ah, that multilingual sweet loud and always strangely cheery and a little angry voice. the liner notes include cd suggestions. a fine thing I tell you, you have no idea, a woman i love to hear talk and sing and think and play. she got me driving too fast-- i got ticketed and blamed it on the music. I had to. it was the truth."
1,Misrepresented,"The video was a nice collection of wonderful features from the past. However, my decision to purchase this item was because Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer was supposed to be included along with others from the same series. They are not on the CD and I had to go back and purchase another CD."
5,Brings back old memories at christmas time,I loved this as a child and i love the fact of sharing with my baby girl! She loves them all and esp Rudolph :)! Its a def must own for anyone who enjoyed watching this on the tv as a child at christmas and now you can have it to share with your little one and watch anytime!
5,Complete Christmas Classics,"Just wanted to say that ""Siver and Gold"" is right in there where it's supposed to be, right after The Misfits meet Yukon Cornelius. Plus there's a cute little scene at very end (not included in the broadcast TV version) where Yukon discovers a peppermint mine......if your kids haven't seen these classics they're missing out!Colliemom"
5,The Classics...,"I love this series! I'm 33 years old and it takes me back to being a kid when they played the cartoons on tv on Sunday nights. My son (he's 4) absolutely adores Rudolph.This is great collection because it has the classic songs and cartoons. The Cricket on the Hearth is included in this set and it's a little bizzare, but all in all this is the greatest set I've seen yet.There is also a music CD included. It's awesome."
5,Bringing back childhood!,"This set is great. Got it goldbox for 12.99. I would have paid more. Came in on the day before Thanksgiving. We opened on blackfriday. We watched each movie for each day after. It was the first time my 4yr daughter watched them. She fell in love with Rudolph, and Cricket on the Hearth. She ended up watching them over and over. When I saw her enjoying these classics brought me back to the first time I saw them. A really great dvd set that is fun to watch and will now be an awesome tradition.Comes with everything discribed. And the cable channels don't play most of other shows anymore. My favorite is The Little Drummer Boy. You never get to see this one anymore on TV.Get this set for great family Christmas shows."
5,For my kids.,I bought these for my kids & they are still watching them even though x-mas has pasted.
5,THE ORIGINAL CHRISTMAS CLASSICS (RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER/SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN/FROSTY THE SNOWMAN/FROSTY RETURNS,FLAWLESS TRANSACTION WITH A PLATINUM SELLER WHOM I HIGHLY RECOMMEND; THANKS FOR A GREAT PRODUCT!
3,"Received one damaged disc, but received replacement quick","This was a christmas gift, so I bought it early in hopes to get some christmas shopping out of the way. I received the movie pack, and one of the discs was completely cracked almost in half. I was pretty upset about that, but when I contacted the seller, he sent the replacement disc within a week, and that made me feel a lot better. I was very satisfied with how quickly and nicely the situation was handled."
5,the original christmas classics,An excellent way to got the true classics of the Christmas season in one easy purchase
4,Mostly great memories,"My young son enjoyed all of these old Christmas classics, and I had fun watching them again--well, the first several times, anyway. But ""Frosty Returns"" is a pathetic attempt at capitalizing on name recognition and environmentalism to sell a really stupid movie. Nevertheless, the collection as a whole is enjoyable, delivering the authentic Christmas entertainment many of us remember from childhood. I was delighted to find that my child, in any case, is not too jaded for stop-motion animation (or flying reindeer)."
5,Great Amazon service and product!,"I was so surprised at the speed of order and delivery. Thanks, especially at Christmas time."
3,Have you watched this lately?,"I'm all for good nostalgia, but listen up folks; this movie is ridiculous! Claymation makes it look like Fred Astaire can't dance! Since when was there a Winter Warlock in the legend of Santa Claus? There's not a single mention of ""St. Nicolas"" that I can recall. Most importantly, where the heck is the Mayor (Burgermeister Meisterburger) of grungy little Sombertown get off trying to tell the King he's not allowed to have any toy-makers?There's also a totally psychedelic 70's-esque song slapped in the middle that makes little to no sense.I kid Santa Claus is Comin' to Town! It's a good movie but don't watch it and try to take it seriously. Just shut off your brain and enjoy it."
5,Good Buy,This is a good buy for the price. You get alot for less than $30.00.I enjoy the classic children's christmas specials and was glad it included the Little Drummer Boy. The kids will love it.
4,Great memories!,This takes me back to my childhood. I bought because I just became a grandmother and want to have this to share with my grandchild/ren. My bf and I made pepermint hot cocoa and settled in for a night of early childhood memories. I was dissapointened in the fact that the Santa Claus movie for some reason will not work. All the other movies work perfectly. Maybe I got a bad disk :( I didn't return it because I had already opened and threw away all shipping info. I figured I'll just buy that seperately next year:)
4,classic,I was thrilled to see these classics available on cd. Now we don't have to wait or search for them to come on tv at christmas. I am packing these with the xmas items and it will be a new tradition to watch during christmas time. I did have a missing cd and that was a bummer on christmas morning but amazon was awesome in taking care of it. I look forward to next christmas.
5,Great Christmas Movies,"Great collection of Christmas movies. My son loves Christmas, so this is helping me keep it around all year long!"
5,For all kids old and young,Totally amazing ! was a special mement sitting with my daughter watching the shows i watched as a kid !! highly recommended
5,fabulous!!,A great product at a great price. It arrived in good shape and well before christmas. Thanks!!
5,"Unless you are Grinch or Scrooge, this is a must-have.",This is a must for your Christmas DVD collection. I also recommend Scrooge with Albert Finney as a must-have.
4,Christmas specials,"My daughter really enjoyed the christmas specials on these DVD's. Some of them were a little grainey, but they were still great to see"
4,The Original Christmas Classics,"Yes, it's the same old crappy christmas specials that the kids just have to see. They're not as exciting as when I was their age."
3,Movies are good,"The movies were as they should be, but the plastic inside that holds the disks in place was broken. Fortunatly none of the disks were scratched or damaged.... please be more carful. Thank you"
2,only 3 movies!,"i like the movies, but the physical version of this set has 7 movies. Total rip-off. I would have just bought the real DVDs."
5,Love Amazon!,"This item arrived quickly, in time for plenty of ""christmasing"" with the various movies to choose from! Thanks for all the choices in items and prices Amazon...you save moms like me a ton of time and money."
4,"Christmas classics, with no commercials!!!","Yes, these are (most of) the classics that you know and love. Others have expressed their concerns about the videos, so I won't bother.Note that this is a set of 7 videos, on 3 DVDs and includes a CD of music.I marked it with 4 stars because the DVDs are difficult to remove from the case (a strange non-standard hub lock) and each of the DVDs is labelled prominently with the main feature, while the minor videos are labelled in small type at the bottom edge of the disk. It's impossible to read without my ""old man"" glasses.The features themselves are a joy to watch, especially sweet when you don't have to deal with commercials. My daughter (now in her mid 20s) says she misses the 20 year old Snuggle fabric softener, and Santa riding the ""Noelco"" electric shaver commercials from our home-taped VHS copy, but I expect she will be able to cope. ;^)"
4,A classic,Brought back wonderful memories. Thank you so much. Played beautifully without any interference. Nice to see the classics are still around.
5,Christmas Classics,I received the movies way sooner than expected which was a nice suprise. Seeing them brought back lots of great childhood memories. I bought them to share with my own son and his cousins.
5,Grew up watching these on TV,These are the old favorites kids watched years ago. I'm thrilled that someone finally put these on DVD so my kids can enjoy them.
5,Best Set Ever,My mom and I were heartbroken when we learned that my father taped over all our Christmas specials from when I was a kid. This set has the classic Christmas stories that we grew up with and now the younger generations are too. This is a must have for anyone who enoys the simpler times before christmas became what it is today :)
1,where is rudolph?,"I bought the Christmas classics box set on video, which shows rudolph on the cover, but that video was not included. What's the deal?"
5,Good Deal!,I was pleased to find all of my favorites on one dvd. Our VHS finally died and I had to replace my VHS copies of these movies.
4,Great nostalgia,"I used to watch these movies as a child, and they are as great as I remember. Cricket on the Hearth is the only one I never watched before (or even head of), and now I'm glad I haven't. It's incredibly depressing and boring. The other six are all wonderful Christmas classics and I will always enjoy watching. Also, as a bonus, this set comes with an audio CD of Christmas songs!"
3,not as we remember...,"there are a few great memories with this DVD that I am happy to share with my children... but it still isn't right. the sound doesnt match up right... and there are missing pieces from the script. I wish I still had my VHS copy, It was so much better..."
2,Where is Frosty Returns???,"I bought this because I wanted my children to be able to enjoy the same movies I enjoyed as a child, which they have. But I have one problem... Frosty Returns is not there. It should be on the same DVD as Frosty the Snowman, but both the Frosty the Snowman and the Frosty Returns links play Frosty the Snowman. It's bizarre and disappointing. But the movies that are actually on there are great."
3,one glaring omission,"I don't own this DVD yet. I'm not sure if I will. We own most of these on VHS but have long wanted them on DVD for many of the convenience factors. But there is one problem. The all-time favorite of the Rankin/Bass productions, The Year Without a Santa Claus is not included in this set. If Heat/Snow Miser doe not qualify as classic, then I don't know what is."
1,Arrived shattered and broken.,"I ordered this and all the plastic inside of the DVD set arrived smashed. You could literally hear all the tiny pieces moving around when you moved around the DVD set, and you could see all the tiny pieces of plastic moving around inside. You could also hear the DVDs moving around because all of their plastic keepers were shattered. I didn't even open it because I knew it had to immediately go back. Shame on you Amazon. Where is your quality control??? How could you send something like this out to anyone much less a loyal, long-term customer? And it was not broken in transit because the box it arrived in didn't have a dent."
1,"Useless ""Twaddle"" that should never be shown to children.","I didn't realize how bad these movies were growing up. I watched them every year as a child; I even looked forward to them, but honestly, they are trash. Watching them now thirty-five years later, I see they have horrible story lines, poor dialogue, and terrible behavior. For example, Rudolph is bullied to a degree that I didn't remember, even by Santa, an elf hits another elf over the head to test a toy, another elf removes the teeth of the abominable snowman, and some very demeaning comments in general. I feel these movies exposed my children to ideas and attitudes that are verboten today for good reason. Not everything that is ""old"" or ""original"" is of true value - and some isn't worth anything beyond studying the change in societal attitudes from generation to generation."
1,Horrible,"This is ridiculous and horrible. I can't believe it's now on my Amazon video library. The dialogue, songs and overall plot is absolutely annoying."
4,Original Christmas Classics,I ordered this dvd collection of Christmas favorites for my husband. The plastic case was cracked in several places when it arrived a day later than predicted. The dvd's were in good shape and he loves them.
4,Classic Christmas movies together in a great bundle,"This is a great bundle of classic Christmas shows for children. Rudolph, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and Frosty the Snowman are great and my children watch these multiple times this past Christmas season. Frosty Returns really isn't that good in my opinion, and Cricket on the Hearth is a little strange. But the others make this collection well worth the purchase."
3,The story never got started....,"and we never got to see Austin needing Molly. We heard about it.....in his head.....but did she see his vulnerability? No. For the first 200 pages, she was packing her bags and threatening to leave while he somehow healed and grew stronger without her assistance. How? Beats me.The secondary story of Mark and Gabrielle was unnecessary. This was about Molly and Austin....although we never really sunk our teeth into Molly and Austin because Mark and Gabrielle kept popping back into the picture. I wish she would do a re-write because the potential for a great romance was somewhere in those pages....I just couldn't find it."
3,One Fine Day,"I expected to really like this book because I liked Molly and thought her a sympathetic character in the prequel. However, once I started this book, I had a hard time liking it because I didn't like Molly or Austin much. Her excessive worry about things like her daughter being pregnant grated on my nerves. I wanted to tell her to grow up and stop worrying so much. Instead of being happy for her daughter, she asked how many kids her daughter and son-in-law planned to have so she would know how many more times she'd have to worry! How awful.It made me understand why Austin might snap at her. Molly and Austin's relationship was so horrible on both sides, that I found it hard to believe they could end up together. He was verbally abusive which Molly made a huge point of, but she was emotionally abusive to him. The book shows there are definitely two sides to the story. In this case, neither side was good. I didn't like this near as much as I like its prequel, Forever."
2,Started out very strong,"Because of the great reviews, I read this book. I thought it started out strong but fizzled out towards the end."
4,Very good book,I downloaded this book on my Kindel and enjoyed reading it very much. It was an easy read and one that left you with a good feeling.
3,"I give it a ""meh""","The book is ok...meaning it's not great and it's not terrible, if that helps at all! It is not a light comedy as others have mentioned, but it is written fairly articulately and the story moves along. There is some concerning content (the husband's treatment towards sex while they were married borders on rape) and the other sex scenes were unnecessarily graphic, but that always turn me off a book anyways. I give it a ""meh"" - it was a cheap download, got my moneys worth, have already forgotten it and moved on. I would not recommend if it's more than a buck to buy."
4,A midwestern grandma's advice: some applicable & some not!,"This collection of grandmothers' wisdom gave me needed comfort immediately following my grandmother's death. It reminds midwestern readers of their grandmas' actions and advice. It should not be read cover to cover in one sitting, but rather in small doses at a time. This allows reflection & memories of a reader's own grandmother. The pages following the advice gave welcomed space to jot down individual memories."
2,"Interesting, but......","Here's a novel idea: If you are going to write a book, GET AN EDITOR!!!!!! This book is filled with inaccuracies, both spelling and factual, which make it very hard to take seriously. Example: An entire chapter is written on suspect George Chapman. No problem here, except the author claims Chapman was the second suspect cited by the MacNaughten Memoranda. He completely omits the person MacNaughten actually cited, Michael Ostrog. To the author's credit, Chapman should be considered more of a serious suspect than Ostrog anyway. Nevertheless, the inaccuracies are hard to overlook. He repeats ""facts"" stated in other books that have been long proven false, and misspells them while doing so. There are much better books on the market."
2,"Jack the Ripper, Crime Scene Investigation","Written well, but with many many typos. Hard to concentrate onthe book when you are busy correcting the wording on each page. Overall, have read better accounts of the Ripper."
1,"Dr. Speare, What were you thinking?","I am an avid reader of Jack the Ripper materials, and have read most of the books out there by respected ""Ripperologists"" This, however, is by far THE WORST! Asside from the HUGE number of typographical errors, this man has names wrong, dates wrong, and facts wrong. In fact, on one page, he refers to the same person (Martha Tabram) by three different names. How this book got published is beyond me. It read more like a first-draft of a POSSIBLE manuscript. And what does that say about his ""editor"" Take my advice - DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. IT'S MORE OF A MYSTERY THEN THE RIPPER CRIMES!"
1,A sad case,"This is such a sad case. There are many inaccuracies and if a reader can ignore these there are enough grammatical and spelling errors to make this work a perfect candidate for English 101 students to rip apart. We encounter the word `seen' when `scene' is intended and so forth. An editor and a critic could have helped Dr. David J. Speare (veterinarian) turn this into a viable work. Some sections of the work seem well done and I felt I was learning things that I had never even encountered in the many works on the Ripper I had read in the past, and then there would be an inaccuracy and a misspelling and I would question the whole.The publication date of this work should probably have been postponed until 2007 or later, after research and proofing had taken place. Great potential, but a waste of money and effort as it stands."
4,If you liked the Moonshae trilogy you'll like this,"Tells of Robyn and Tristans daughters, and the tribulations they went through to get Tristan back. A very well written story, great fighting and stratagy and even some unlikely allies. All in all a great book!"
3,Out of date information,"This is a great reference book for places to visit in the Pacific Northwest, HOWEVER, be sure to call the places you intend to visit before you go. A lot of the information is now outdated, and the prices are not even remotely accurate that they have published from 2000. We took a trip to Portland to visit Farrel's Ice Cream to find it has been out of business for year. We called Yamhill's Flying M Ranch about their cabins to hear ""that must be a really old ad,we don't have cabins"". A trip this weekend to Astoria, Oregon we found the locations they list as ""free"" are no longer free."
5,GREAT DOCUMENTARY!!!!,"If you'd like a introduction into the history of black folks (people of african descent) I suggest you watch this dvd. I love it, I already knew some of this information yet I learned even more by watching this. To the ignorant folks that will say it's bad well that's only because they know it's true and it is documented you just have to do the research for yourself. The truth has been hidden for years and still is, they don't teach you the real information in the school system so to everyone use this as your stepping stone and continue to do your own research online & in books."
3,Good ideas but short on evidence,"There were some excellent ideas discussed in this film. I particularly enjoyed the solutions chapter. The discussion in this chapter on criminality is great. I would have rated this documentary higher if more of the claims throughout the movie were supported by evidence. Some of the points are fairly easy to argue against, especially the claims against the feminist movement and the problems with black men acting like women. It seems to me that third wave feminism, which looks at race and sex simultaneously, is ignored. Arguments at some times border on sexist. Despite these issues, I think that this is a film worth checking out."
5,Hidden Colors,This was an awesome dvd...It shared much history and information that people of color must see to identify who they are and what they represent.....
3,"Hidden Colors: the untold history of people of aboriginal, Moor, and African Descent","This video is very interesting and informative. But, I felt there was too much personal opinion as oppossed to scholarly information. Over-all I enjoyed this video and suggest its content is better fit for teenagers of African descent. However, this video may not have the necessary cited works for those studying on the college level."
1,Never Received It,"I never received this item. I was told that Amazon could not get this for me. Therefore, I cannot tell you whether or not I liked it. Please let me know what went wrong with this order. Thank you.Hannah Heller"
2,Rachel is disappointing,"After reading Springwater, I eagerly anticipated Rachel. I was very disappointed. This second book in the series lacked the poignancy and depth of the first. Of course, there were great moments of laughter and warmth as Miller's books always provide. However, the romance between Trey and Rachel seemed flat and almost forced. It definitely did not carry on the tradition established in Springwater. A disappointment, overall."
2,A Lead in to her Other Books,"To me, this book was just a lead in to her next books. They met, they fell in love. I certainly didn't feel the feeling between the two main characters, Rachel and Trey. I did see her building new stories, but that was about all. A short read. Nothing to get lost in."
3,I liked it,"It is just a little book that is short, sweet & a fast read. I had a quiet evening & it was perfect for just that opportunity."
2,I thought this book was O.K. but nothing special...,To be honest this book really didn't do much for me. It was a bit boring. Nothing was really going on in the book & the couple didn't even start a relationship until the last 10 pages of the book & then all of a sudden they were wed. Rachel came to Springwater to be the first teacher & upon her arrival she meets Trey & soon finds out that he is part-owner of the Saloon across the street from her school. She despises the Saloon but they soon find that they care for one another. Not much more then that. The book was just lacking something. It needed some adventure or something. I sure hope the rest of this series gets better. This is book #2 in the Springwater series.
3,Short but sweet,As only Ms. Miller can do she makes you feel like your there. Although on the short side I truly enjoyed her telling of a teachers tale. I'm looking forward to the next in the series and more to come
2,No joy with the chew ring,"I ordered three catnip chew rings, mostly to justify the shipping expense. As it turns out, the ring is not large and easily could have been shipped in a padded mailer for a fraction of the cost. I had hoped my new kitten would use this as a teething ring and my older cat would also enjoy one. Neither cat has the slightest interest. Thinking perhaps the catnip was past its prime, I rubbed them in some fresh to entice the cats to at least play with them. One mouthful of the fringe was enough for each cat. I gave the third ring to a friend who fosters kittens. Not one of the five she has would use the ring. I sure can't call these a good deal."
3,Cool Look,"My cat is not a fan of this particular toy. She looks at it when I toss it to her, and then walks away. She's not big on catnip, though, so she really has to be into the design of any catnip toy to appreciate it. I do love the look of this chew ring, though, and all the Pet Stages fabric toys. They make such cool looking toys for cats. Too bad my cat doesn't feel the same way about this one!! She's going to give it to her cousin to see if he likes it."
2,cute but cats don't play with it much,cute but haven't seen the cats play with it much even when i try to play with it with them.
2,Not so great...,"it's an ok toy. no where near as popular as the pet stages cat nip chew mice, however, of which there are two in a pack and are around the same price. this is only the one singular ring. in all honesty, it basically never gets played with."
2,Not sure if Kittens like it,"I bought this product for my 2 month kitten since someone recommended me that it was going very useful through the toothing stage, to chew on this toy. But my cat didn't seemed to like it and never used it."
4,Great album,great album soulfull Michael MCDONALD GETS BETTER LIKE GOOD WINE love itgreat condition wait no time to get it
4,I keep forgettin' how good he is.,"This is pretty much the collection I've been waiting for for many years. His ""Very Best Of"" had plenty of great tracks on it, but lacked his Doobie Brothers songs. And of course the DB collections have none of his solo work on them. So this is basically the best of both worlds, and a good 19 tracks too. I don't think the casual fan will be missing anything from this. Included is ""What A Fool Believes"", ""Ya Mo B There"", ""On My Own"", ""It Keeps You Runnin'"", and many more. There's also my personal favorite ""Sweet Freedom"". Overall a super collection, and one of the great voices in music. It would go well with ""The Best Of The Doobies""."
5,Great CD,I received my order promptly and perfect condition. I love the CD and will order again.ThanksWanda Jensen
5,A wonderful collection with all the great ones.,"A must have! A jammin' good time! In response to A Kid's Review of Oct. 6, 2005, what in heaven's name did they think ""The Ultimate Collection"" would be? Duh!"
4,Jipped!,"Great to include the Doobies' songs, but why the heck can't we get the full song, not these chopped versions? C'mon Rhino, I expected better from you. Best of had the same chopped #4 and #6 songs, not sure about #13.4. Yah Mo B There - (single version, with James Ingram)5. Takin' It To The Streets - (single version, with The Doobie Brothers)6. Sweet Freedom - (single version)13. Take It To Heart - (radio edit)"
3,I have all of this stuff...,"I'm so tired of record companys releasing stuff that's alreadybeen released many times. The only thing different about thiscomp from the previous Warner's ""best of"" is that includes Mike'swork with the Doobies. I want to here new material!!! I am looking forward to his new Christmas album to released this fall."
4,"A little, humble homage to hard-working immigrants","I went to see this picture without much information in a small budget theater. Humble also is the movie itself. Certainly one can only like Pilar Padilla in her role as an outspoken working woman that ends up as a Latina Norma Rae. Yet, there is a long distance with Sally Field. The power of the movie is not on the performances (quite credible and engaging); it is in the story itself. ""Bread and roses"" becomes a demand for social justice with a twist: ""Don't give us just bread, we have the right to enjoy the roses too."" Life for the exploited immigrants (and any worker) should not be restricted to their permanent demand for job and food. Life requires a little indulgence: the right to enjoy it fully and rightfully."
3,Not quite detailed enough,This book is a good resource for day to day XP administration but doesn't go into sufficient detail to be the only study guide for taking the 70-270 exam. Many questions on the exam are not even hinted at in this book. This should be studied first and followed up with more comprehensive exam prep material.
4,"Excellent book, poor CD-ROM based practice exam",The book itself is well written and covers a lot of gound for such in relatively few pages. The CD-ROM is awful; questions that are difficult to decipher because of poor spacing (where does answer B end and answer C begin?)
5,robert clarke,i found robert clarke's story to be excellent reading. i recall watching some of his films on television many years ago. he didn't seem to have a big ego like some successful actors have. he seemed to appreciate what success he had. i saw him playing different roles on reruns of adam-12 and dragnet from the late 1960's and early 1970's that are now on antenna-tv. i like that his book is not one of those kiss and tell types where he brags about how many women he slept with over his lifetime.
5,READ THE BOOK - Critique the content - not the author,"You may disagree with the politics - that is fair. However, when you read reviews that are based on the ""person,"" only, rather then the content of the book- that is, in one word, sophomoric. For example, one reviewer stated: ""More lies and distorions from the scum behind the Swift Boat liars. Don't waste your money."" This offers what to any serious discussion. Further, I would garner a bet that the person has not read the book. Mr. Corsi posits some very serious theories, that if have an iota of truth, we should consider. If one person does not consider Iran to be an imminent threat to our society and way of life, that person lives in a land that contains the likes of the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. This is a new world; what transpired on 9/11/01 change the world forever. Evaluate the content of the book; look for discrepancies or something to challenge his conclusions. Leave the personal attacks out. It accomplishes little."
1,Pure right wing propaganda,"Although some of the info is accurate and a nuclear Iran can be danger to world peace, this author lacks honesty. As one of the other reviewers so eloquently puts it: ""the man who has neglected to take any meaningful action at all against Iran's nuclear ambitions, Jerome Corsi now has the gall to write a book about the threat of Iran's impending nuclear arsenal. If Mr Corsi were so concerned about the Iranian threat, why, one must wonder, would he so ethusiastically and shamelessly support the re-election of a President who ignored that threat to America in favor of his personal agenda in Iraq?"""
1,Straight from the Holy city of Tel Aviv where the Angles Fly,"hey Corsi, how's the weather in Tel Aviv ?I was near finishing the first 160 (+/-) pages that a revelation struck me: I NEED TO GET MY MONEY BACK !!!Instead of buying this book, borrow it from your local library and you will find out why I say so; I would have appreciated if the book was written in Hebrew since at least we could say it is original.Even Fox News couldn't do such a propaganda masterpiece."
1,"Beware Not of Iran, But Of The Suspect Writer","Thank you Mr. Corsi for bringing Iran into the forefront of nuclear proliferation. This is an important subject and one that deserves to be under scrutiny.However, the author has been caught plagiarizing recently. So, one has to wonder about the integrity of any data in the book. Read it with both eyes wide open and make sure you have a clear shot at the garbage can for a rimless shot!"
5,Fun Toy,"This toy is not meant for young children who like to be very rough with their toys (throwing, stomping, etc.). It is very cute. It is good to hug when you are sad, lonely, etc. I am 9-years-old and my Mom is typing this for me.this pikachu is the best. he talks and his mouth moves. so do his ears. he is just the cutest thing i have ever seen. i give him a 100 gold star rating."
3,Focus on the threat,"The author looks not just at Iran's efforts to build a nuclear weapon but also the work it has put into its ballistic missile program, its influence among terrorist groups and the money it has spent to influence American politicians to look the other way (or in the case of Kerry/Edwards, to actually provide assistance).The material is presented in a well-written, if partisan manner. Great photos, but the first one is NOT a Shahab-3 as the caption says... it is an unrelated Soviet-era Surface-to-Air missile.The author makes sure that we understand: Iran with a nuclear weapon is a LOT different than France with a nuclear weapon. Iran is led by a cabal of mullahs who are intent on destroying Israel and the United States.Once they have the means, who is to say they will not try to do it?"
5,Atomic Iran,"Readers of this book will gain great insight into the grave danger facing the USA in dealing with an atomic Iran and its despotic , defiant mullahs with their twisted version of Islamic religion and law. Dr. Corsi shows them marching zealously and relentlessly to fulfill their stated goals of ""wiping Israel off the map"" and crippling "" America,the Great Satan"".The ultimate goal is to force the entire world to conform to their Islamic theocracy. Read the pros and cons for allowing Iran to developnuclear power. Then decide if you want appeasement or force.This book may scare you; but you should be scared."
1,COMPLETELY BIASED AND SHAMEFUL,"This book is just trying to condemn the Iranians and some American politicians (democrats) without any solid justificiations. The author shows strange sympathy for republicans and Jews ignoring the fact that Israel has also an illegal nuclear programme destabilizing the Middle East with its 200 nuclear warheads and if we are seeking stability in that region then everybody must come clean.Furthermore even the title shows that the author is onesided: 'Atomic Iran: How the """"""Terrorist Regime"""""" Bought the Bomb and American Politicians'I have a piece of advice for the author:VERDICT COMES AT THE END OF THE TRIAL NOT AT THE BEGINNING.A good writer should analyze a situation from different point of views and let the readers to jugde and draw conclusions from the content.I think 'Iran's Nuclear Option: Tehran's Quest For The Atom Bomb' by Al J. Venter is much more better book as it is:-Not biased-Much more detailed-Cheaper"
1,I would question the motives of this author,"I have not read this book, but I do have to make a statement about the integrity of Mr. Corsi. He helped torpedo John Kerry when he co-wrote""Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry"", which helped in getting Bush re-elected!!Shame on him.I have heard Mr. Corsi deride, on Coast to Coast AM, this administration now, after the fact-duh, but I am still waiting for an apology!He helped this madman get elected and he is responsible for all that has followed. I would question his integrity and wonder what his motives are for writing anything!"
4,Elegant Watch for a Reasonable Price,"I just bought this watch and I am quite happy with it. It has a nice look and feel to it, without breaking the bank. I highly recommend this watch and this brand. This is my second Citizen Eco Drive watch."
5,nice little bracelet watch,"this watch is flashy yet not overly ostentatious. it definitely catches the eye, and the detail is very nice on closer examination. it is somewhat formal, but not so much so that it doesn't work with more casual outfits.it looks very much like a bracelet, which is what i wanted for my wife. i was looking for a nice looking bracelet that also happened to tell time, rather than a watch per se. you may find that it is not the easiest watch to tell time with, but that's not its purpose.it is well made and very small, my wife has very small wrists and it fits her perfectly. all in all it is a great decorative piece."
4,The Back Sleep DVD,"I won't go into the plot or performances, since if you're buying this movie, you are probably a fan or collector of vintage horror and science fiction, and know all the particulars. The DVD quality is pretty good...not on par with DVDs of 30's, 40's, and 50's horror flicks produced by major companies such as MGM. But quality is much better than the bootleg/grey market VHS tapes you can purchase through the web (one of which I did own before I purchased this DVD). If you're a fan of this genre...a big thumbs up!"
4,What a trio!,"Most people arent aware of this little gem including myself....so when i happened on it and noticed it starred three of my favorites ( Lugosi, Chaney and Rathbone ) so i bought it immediately! b-movie or not it was definetly entertaining!"
2,"I must be getting older,I didn't like This.Trailer is included.","When i was a kid i always looked forward to buying Tv Guide because a movie like this was called a Melodrama,any time you saw that you knew it was a horror movie.This 1 lost however even with MGM Leo the Lion start,atmospheric b&w; crystal-clear perfect picture,and horror veteran cast.Lead man wasn't too convincing even Daniel Boones' wife couldn't save this.Crazy-man Carradine,Lunging-Lon,Bright-Eyed Tor,Silent-Bela,Forceful and Demanding Basil.Oh and a running screaming woman on fire,THUD!That scene was pretty cool to watch.If you like to see horror veterans then you should buy this,other-wise save your money and buy something else.I used to like this when i first saw it,not anymore.If you really want 2 great movies,then get your hands on,The Comedy of Terrors and also The Raven,both with Karloff,Lorre,& Price."
3,average 50's flick has many greats in it.,"This movie has a killer cast to be sure. Bela lugosi, basil rathbone, lon chaney jr. akim tarrof and others! they all do a first class job. This isn't though a bloody type of horror movie , instead it's a gothic body snatcher type of flick that takes place in victorian times. A mad doctor expirements on people to find out about the brains functions and on that level it's a good one. SOme horror fans will want something else from this cast like a bloody mad scientist movie with monsters but that's not what this is. THe print looks pretty good and it's in black and white in it's theatrical aspect. This is a average flick for it's day and that's good enough for a fan of fifties gothic horror imo."
1,"Not so good, the bad and the worse.","Beware of this and other brands on this page.In the past year i have purchased or received as a present, Three (3) of these devices. ALL - each and every one lasted just beyond the 90 day waranty and my requests for assistance to the manufactures went unanswered.I located the parent co. for the above and behold...they are the parents of many brands making these same devices and the parent co. of my three devices.They too, have not responded to request 2 months ago.FUNAI is the parent of the following and all their brands (listed below) come from the same enginers and pile.Brands: Sylvania....Seyesphere....Emerson....Adventurer....Durobrand....Ero....Magnavox.... Murokai and under the parents name.....FUNAIGood luck, buy one that will work for more than 91 days.JVC DRMV99B DVD Video Recorder&VHS; Combo with Built-In ATSC Tuner"
1,bad VCR WORKS FOR 30 SECONDS AND SHOTS OFF,It was a recondition VCR DVD Recorder . THE VCR only works for 30 seconds and then shouts off. Sylvania #ZV4200SL8. PIECE OF JUNK
3,Season Review,"From a fan's perspective its not really in depth highlights.Also, as soon as i opened the DVD box it was filled with Arsenal DVD ads. Major turnoff. I thought this was a Production of Chelsea TV. But overall a good collectors item for Chelsea fans. KTBFFH!!!"
3,Price???,"I don't have this one but I have other season reviews and their pretty good, could be better. But $1,000 dollars for a DVD, for that money I better get a plane ticket to England and get to spend the day with the entire team!"
2,"Okay, but not a strong purchase","I think Sekou Sundiata is a great poet, and I think his attempts to meld poetry with music are brave. However, it's not a very entertaining record, and I haven't listened to it more than a few times, and only spotty-like at best. The folk-ish mood of the record isn't my style, and I can't safely recommend it to anyone who's into a lot of slam poetry or ""Slam"" the movie. It's more of a folk music record with poems on top of it, much like Carl Hancock Rux' weak record (""Rux Revue"") is a blues/folk record with poems thrown on top of it.If poets want to attract people to poetry, don't approach it from the stance that what you're doing hasn't been done ""quite this way before"", so much as ""it might be different, but will people I'd like to reach dig it?""I like his poetry, and found his monologue grand. But the stuff with music (the rest of the CD) just sits there on my shelf."
3,Better than expected.,"This movie's greatest virtue is its realism. The movie is devoid of phony acting and an implausible or complicated plot. It is simply a story of a married woman who loves her husband and has been faithful but then encounters a guy who she falls heads over heels for and with whom she has an affair.The movie is well made. The acting is fine. The color and picture quality are indeed very good. The movie was in letterbox format which was okay since there were many close up shots of the actors. There were some very picturesque shots of Scotland.Bardot looked trim, youthful and exceedingly lovely throughout this movie.Overall a better movie than I expected it to be."
2,Brigitte in Scotland,"This 1967 Brigitte Bardot vehicle, actually entitled ""A Coeur Joie!"" (""Head Over Heels"") features an appropriately bored-looking Brigitte portraying a bored housewife who, on a whim, takes off for Scotland with a handsome lover (Laurent Terzieff). The on-location footage at a Scottish castle is lovely, but not as gorgeous as Brigitte, who set new standards for French beauty. Although the story does not amount to much, there are lots of little touches to amuse anyone interested in French culture. For example, drinking milk is employed as a torture, while smoking and drinking are presented as healthy pastimes. In the most amazing scene, Brigitte (a real-life animal rights activist) not only pets her dog but also her fish! The standard video release of this film is in letterbox format with large yellow subtitles written across the black stripe at the bottom of the screen. The visibility of the words is so good that one wishes that the dialogue made more sense."
2,Jigsaw,It was a quick easy read. However it didn't grab my attention as much as I thought it would have. I didn't appreciate the swearing and graphic sexual imagesthroughout it either. I thought the ending was anticlimactic and short.
5,Great series,Jigsaw is the 24th in the series. And the 24th is as good as the 1st. So many series start a down hill slide after a few books. Not the 87th precinct the characters just get better. Story lines are just as interesting. Mcbain was definitely one of the best in his genre
4,First time reading McBain...,"Gave it a try 'cause it was a freebie on my Kindle and was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed it. An oldie, but goodie...have read several more since then!"
2,A little outdated,"This 87th Precinct series is a reliable detective who-dun-it, and if you are into the 60's, you will enjoy the references. Beware - it's written in the 60's so it may not delight those with strict PC attitudes. I remember reading some of this series many, many years ago and found it just a bit outdated for me now."
4,Interesting,This is a well written book. The characters are very believable and interact well with each other. It is nice to read a good mystery and not have to put up with a lot of bad language and a lot of detailed sex scenes.
2,rating,"limited plot development, story moves very slow, characters are not well developed. It contains many clichés with little to really move story along"
1,Save your money -- not worth reading even for free.,"There was virtually no tension in this story, and the plot consisted mostly of assembling pieces of a photo cut into pieces, distributed among several people. There were several beatings and a couple of murders, none of which was surprising, or exciting, or cause of much concern. The policework was rather boring and the dialogue was stilted and outdated. The author's descriptions and comments were trite and often embarrassing in their old-fashionedness, and his attitude toward women from another era.I had remembered 87th Precinct mysteries as being much better -- so either my recollection is at fault, or this one is simply a loser.Even at the special price of $1.00 this is a waste."
4,Ed McBain's 87th Precinct Series,"In our fast paced world, the key to these books is to read them from the prespective of the time they were written. Ed McBain was the precursor to many contemporary mystery authors and it is fascinating to see/read the evolution, not only of plot lines and police investigative methods, but styles and methods of writing. He did a lot of research which undrepins the plots and makes many of his stories human and compelling. The plots are simple but there is sometimes a special twist. There is a lot of narrative describing the background of the era or the person, which sometimes feels like preaching but be patient. Slow down and take your time reading this series because reading them is a step back into a time not so long ago."
5,mcbain is the master,Another outstanding entry in the 87th Precinct police procedurals. This one will keep you up all night.
2,Not For Me,The book was written in a style that seemed like I was watching one of those old 30's black and white gangster movies. Too corney for me.
3,Fairly decent read,It was okay for a plane ride which is what I did. I like this type of story but it was not a top author.
2,Stiff,"Although recommended by a friend with usually similar reading tastes, struggled to get through this and doubt I'll attempt others by Maloney."
4,Australian SF Reader,"Murray Whelan is supposed to be a garden variety electoral officer. In reality, he does a lot more troubleshooting than paperwork and answering complaint letters.A deputy minister asks him to look into the death of a Turkish meat packer at a factory.Amusing antics follow as much dodgy brothers business is discovered."
3,Amazing Footage; Hilariously Bad Translation From Chinese,"If you're a serious student of ancient Silk Road history, the footage shown in this video must absolutely be seen. It appears to be mostly edited outtakes from the famous Sino-Japanese Silk Road Expedition from a couple of decades back which was widely broadcast on public television, except the excerpted video shown hereis, oddly, spectacular compared to the television product. Therefore, a must-see!However, the English subtitles are so badly translated from the Chinese they are either largely incomprehensible or so unintentionally funny you'll laugh out loud. Translation doesn't get any worse than this.Nonetheless, a fine video of remarkable ruins and artifacts that will take your breath away! Recommended."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I ordered two of the Krusell Multiadapters. Both of them had a snap broken when they arrived so they would not attach. I was looking for a good quality holder for my TREO and this was not it. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the item, and would not buy another one. I would not suggest this product to anyone."
3,A good mix.,"It's been said that this is missing too many tracks from the film, and while that's true, what's here is still mostly good. With the exeption of ""311"", ""Chuck D"", and ""Hole"", alot of this is electronica/shoegazer type stuff. The songs fron ""Radiohead"", ""Curve"", ""Catherine Wheel"", and ""James"" are all great, but my favorite track is from ""Lush"". ""I Have The Moon"" is just a really beautiful song. Any major fan of these bands or the movie should dig this. This is also similar to the out of print ""Doom Generation"" soundtrack, (same director)."
5,A nice variety of musik that fits the character of the movie,"The cd isn't all the same stuff. You get a little variety in every song. From The Chemical Brothers to Massive Attack, I know that I'll be listening to this cd for a long time."
4,WHY GOD HAS GRAY HAIR,"This book is truly a delightful read!Set in the 1930's and based on the author's own experiences, the book paints vivid pictures of her family, her school mates and life as it was then. She takes us on a journey from her first, bewildering day of school through her 8th grade graduation.I found myself smiling, even laughing out loud at times as she recounts warm, sometimes hilarious tales. This book brings back so many memories of my own school days.If you enjoyed Do Black Patent Leather Shoes Really Reflect UP? Over The Tavern or Late Nite Catechism, you will enjoy this one!Short (170 pages) it left me wanting more. More about the characters, the family and more about Sophia herself."
4,Couldn't Put It Down,"This is one of the best little books I've read in a long time. It reminded me so much of my own school days - another time, another placeto be sure, but so much in common! Sophia Zufa tells charming stories that had me laughing out loud. Her schoolmates and her neighbors become very real as do the times of the Depression Era. I highly recommend this book!"
5,Traveling Harp Wizard Needs Home,"Rice Miller was a man of many faces, tones, and zip codes. THis disc packs some of the fiercest, most downhome sounds that Mississippi had to offer. Includes a radio broadcast from the KING BICUIT FLOWER HOUR and definitve versions of such tunes as ""She Brought Life Back To The Dead,"" ""Cool Blues,"" and ""Eyesight To The Blind."" As well, ""Mighty Long Time"" is a marvel. Wonderful harp with Willie Love on piano, and Elmore James on guitar for most tracks. Some of the best Sonny Boy available in the States."
5,an angel plays harp,If you are picking up the harp buy this I have played for twenty years and this is one of the first albums I bought.Check out the AbWaaahs. A Mighty Long Time is the closest I have ever heard to heavenly music. I hope I get to hear him up there.
4,Very Good Collection Of Early 1950s Sonny Boy Williamson Recordings,"Sonny Boy Williamson (aka Rice Miller) is one of the giants of the blues. He's been cited as an influence by Eric Clapton, John Mayall and Led Zeppelin, among others.This album contains a number of the tracks Williamson recorded for the Trumpet label in 1951 and a 15 minute radio broadcast from the same period.The sound quality on the Trumpet recordings is acceptable for materal recorded in 1951 by a small record label. It's not up to the recording quality of Williamson's Chess recordings from 1958-59.This is a very worthwhile recording for blues fans but if you're not familiar with Williamson, I would suggest starting with his Down And Out Blues CD. There's a 2CD set of Down And Out Blues available on Amazon in which the 2nd CD of the set has all the Trumpet recordings that are on this CD."
5,Non-Jewish Parent raising a Jewish child? Get this book NOW!,"When our daughter began attending a Jewish day school, the panic set in. What would I do when my child came home from school on Friday night expecting to have Shabbat? The chicken I could cook, but the prayer over the candles? I got on Amazon and ordered everything Judaic I could find. This little book was about half-way through the pile of books and DVDs I'd ordered and I wish it had been the first. The book is small, beautifully illustrated, and serves like a Jewish ""Top Ten"" list of prayers. It includes prayers written in Hebrew characters, transliteration, and English translations. Perfect! Included for each prayer is a brief (1 or 2 sentence) explaination of what the prayer is for and when it is or is not said. Genius!"
2,Crappy,"The VSI series has produced some terrific introductions (notably, Scruton's Kant) but this falls well short. Of course, Hegel's density and obscurity present some unique challenges but Singer's exegesis it extremely flat. Unfortunately, I can't recommend a nice, short introduction to Hegel. As far as I know, no one has yet accomplished this difficult task. However, for those with some philosophy background, I would highly recommend Justus Hartnack's ""An Introduction to Hegel's Logic."" Because its object is Hegel's Logic, you won't find much discussion of the Phenomenology or his work on history. However, in a brilliantly concise 124 pages, Hartnack concisely digests and summarizes Hegel's most difficult work. It's really helpful for understanding how the dialectic works."
2,Not an academic approach,"Some of the psychology in this book is dated. For example, the author frequently refers to homosexuality as a disorder so dire that extensive therapy is preferable over hypnosis.The author frequently throws out case studies, antecedents and statistics to back up his claims, but not once are these properly cited. Had there been proper documentation, the otherwise ridiculous claims that breast sizes can be enlarged with hypnosis (page 106) would be easier to swallow."
4,Want to go on a diet?,I was trying to lose weight. I came across this book at a used book store. I tried the self hypnotism routine. It helped out a little when I think back. But the rest of the book did make for good reading while I was on the beach.
5,Gratitudes from Ukraine,"My grandaughter is very pleased with this book. Excellent print and well designed cover.Mickola Vorokhta, [...]"
5,gorgeous stuff,"Any pianist would be honored to own Bach's ""Clavier""...This book moves through his growth as a pianist and musician.A 'must-have' for any serious pianist."
5,One of the best releases of the 90's,"""Welcome"" is one those rare CD's I can listen to over and over without skipping any tracks. Every track on it is a masterpiece of songwriting and presentation and I find it hard to believe that so many lesser bands are making it big."
1,Don't order these from a m az on!,The publisher includes these extra discs for free. Buy it there instead and save yourself the money and get all 20 discs for less than you'd spend here.
1,Don't Risk Your Money on a Toshiba Plasma,"We bought a 42"" Toshiba plasma tv. It worked for one month. Toshiba has sent a repair crew to our home three times and they can't fix it. we're out $5000. Toshiba promised to fix it or replace it, but, three months later, it's still broken and we're still waiting for our new tv. Since Amazon has a no-return policy for big-screen tv's, we're at the mercy of Toshiba and their terrible customer service. Before shelling out this much money for a plasma, I strongly recommend doing research on the web about manufacturer's customer service. If I had done so, I would have never bought a plasma from Toshiba."
3,Same and Different,"This album finds Mojave 3 treading water while trying to move forward into the sonic territory of recent Flaming Lips records. It is a noble effort, but fails in most regards. The only standout track is the opening song which is just perfect. Otherwise it is the weakest Mojave 3 record to date. If you yearn for that amazing Mojave 3 classic sound, I'd point you to the new Honeychurch cd ""Makes Me Feel Better"" which is just absolutely fantastic. Shilough Hopwood is a genius at song writing and production. Check it out instead of this so so record!"
3,Nothing special,"I liked the first song and a couple others, but it wasn't folk enough to catch my ears and his voice was'nt that unique either."
3,Thought I was listening to Mercury Rev!!!,"If you like the genre, this music is easy listening; the melodies, synthesizer, licks, whistles and riffs sound very much like Mercury Rev, but without the content. Derivative, totally! I enjoyed it mainly because the sound is so similar to Mercury Rev, whom I love. But Mercury Rev offers a lot more. Mojave is *son of* MR...a very young bubblegum son.Their 'linar notes' are so stupidly produced as UNREADABLE that one wonders WHY they were even included. The de*sigh*ners were so adept at making the written thoughts part of the design, that they ARE the design...NOT words. Useless, inaccessable personel info. They must be playing the *mystery* card."
4,"First listens promising but it's not ""Excuses for Travelers""","I've been a huge fan since the Slowdive days and really like Halstead's solo stuff as well. After a few listens so far, only the first track really stands out and it is INCREDIBLE. I'm sure the rest will get better with repeated listens as all good albums do, but ""Excuses for Travellers"" is their best effort. Each Mojave 3 album is excellent but ""Excuses..."" soars from track to track with an urgency and beauty unmatched by any of the others, including ""Spoon and Rafter"". If you are unsure but interested get the ""Excuses for Travelers"" album first."
2,another mediocre solo album by Neil,"I loved Ask Me Tomorrow, the first LP by Mojave 3, but everything that came after sounded more like solo Neil Halstead albums rather than group efforts, which for me was bad news because I was a fan of the alternating vocals between him and Rachel Goswell. Still, I enjoyed their second and third albums for what they were but Spoon & Rafter is my least favorite one so far. The songs sound like uninspired, forgettable pop."
4,Fantastic Guide,"This guide is thorougly researched and very comprehensive. In today's complex society, four-year universities are not the best solution for everyone. The U.S. has seen tremendous growth in private career colleges that prepare students to start a new career quickly.I did notice one significant omission in the listing. Students interested in healthcare careers should visit http://www.heritage-education.com"
3,"like the movie, don't like the DVD","This is the ""Castaways Classic Collection"" version, which must've been reproduced in Zanzibar or Zamboanga -- I was attracted by the low price, but you get what you pay for -- the reproduction is very dark, and the sound is abysmal; many of the words are literally not understandable. I ended up buying the more expensive Criterion version, which is very enjoyable. I would strongly advise NOT to waste money on this ""Castaways"" version, which is properly named: It should be cast away."
5,Great Classic -,This is a wonderful classic movie.. available by import on DVD.. beware some of the cheap ones are not very good .. but there is another release of this movie at a higher price that is very good quality.
3,Magnificent Obsession,This is an okay movie...with good acting by the principals but I found it to be a bit outdated. Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman are good in their roles but the story has been told before and better..by others.
4,Rock Hudson rocks!......,"I know he fell out of favor a long time ago especially with his AIDS diagnosis, but in his day, he was as good a romantic lead as was Cary Grant. This movie showed that. He was the ultimate in romantic leadership with Jane Wyman as his leading lady. She played a blind woman whom Rock Hudson fell in love with after causing her blindness. She fell in love with him without knowing he was the one responsible. A tear-jerker for sure, but with a great ending."
1,BAD VIDEO QUALITY,"I bought this 'castaways pictures' version of the movie and yes, it is the movie in bad visual quality. If you are easily annoyed with this, use the money toward the purchase of a better quality copy, which I wish I did. Make your money count and don't waste your time."
3,Magnificent Obsession VHS,"I remembered this movie when it first came out & just decided to buy it. It's pretty much a ""melodrama"", as the usual for Jane; Rock does pretty good in this, but Agnes Morehead is equally ""starring"" & holdsher own. It's basically a Hollywood ""made-for"" (Rock or Jane), and strictly a movie for the ladies--perhaps interesting for one showing."
4,IS THIS CRITERION OR IMAGE ENERTAINMENT?,Under Product Description Amazon Shows the Studio as Image Entertainment. The picture of the BOX says Criterion on the side of picture.Is this the Criterion Collection release or Image Entertainment. I am going to buy it as soon as I am sure it is a Criterion Film. Great Film.
3,Good story but ending not believable,"I enjoyed the story and loved how a person can choose to change his life for the better. However, for Dr. Merrick to suddenly appear at a sanitarium in New Mexico, and then have a very nice operating room complete with viewing window that you might imagine finding in a large well equiped hospital was a little difficult to swallow. The nurse and companion, Nancy, suddenly became a scrub nurse and miraculously knew every instrument!! And then, to top it off, after a very long and difficult surgery, the patient was placed in a bed in a hotel-style room containing a huge curtained window with fresh air wafting through. There was no IV, no moniters, etc. etc. After such a surgery, the patient would be placed in a post op--critical care environment. I felt the script should have been tweaked enough in the end to make it seem more credible."
1,A cheap knockoff with Chinese or Japanese subtitles,"Buy this from another distributor if you want a copy free of subtitles that could not be turned off. Note the cheesy cut out of the hair on Jane Wymans face? That should have told me right there! Yes, they said I could send it back, but its not worth the aggravation when I will pay as much for a different copy elsewhere."
3,the color is almost hallucinatory,"I liked this movie for its color which evokes the colors of Indian dieties such as Hanuman. Trippy acid colors.The story is over the top, but enjoyable like Johnny Guitar."
2,Predictable,"A wealthy playboy's carelessness causes tragedy. Determined to make amends by doing good works, he gradually undergoes a transformation of character and attains his heart's desire."
1,This DVD won't play on any player,This DVD won't play. It displays a code saying it can't be played on 6 different players -- what a collassal disappointment!
5,A Very Good Message,"This movie has a very good message to it. We would do well to abide by this message, for our everyday lives."
4,My Opinion Thusly,"I have to admit that just as I was starting to savour this thin slip of a book I found that it was, indeed, mere selections. The whole narrative is actually three volumes, over four hundred pages a volume. I was left with a craven empty feeling like a fiend for his needle. Humboldt's writing presages Thoreau and through him ponders the transcendent raptures of the natural world. Reading through the visit to the Caribs reminded me of my visits to the Grenadines where their presence is still redolent in the shadows under the almond trees. I felt that I had imbibed the same air as Humboldt."
2,Just a glimpse of the Journey,"I bught the book, and was expecting it eagerly.Once it arrived I realized I had make a mistake by not realizing it was just an exceprto from the real deal.Only a small part of the trip is described and nothing in the parts I was interested is even mentioned.I hope the other parts will come at any time soon."
4,Sharp As a Tack,"Olympus lives up to its name as one of the finest manufacturers of fine optics, with this relatively inexpensive lens. A wonderful product for those both experienced and wishing to be experienced in the field of macro photogaphy. Suitable for any of the recent and current DSLR ""e"" series cameras. I highly remcommend it not only for it's price but for it's ability to reach magnification ratio of 1:1. The only failing I have found is that when racking the lens way out flash from the DSLR built in flash causes the lens to cast its shadow in the frame. No such problem if using aa auxilary flash such as the Olympus FL-36R, expecially when used with an auxialry flash bracket.Want good value for less bucks?This is the lens for you!"
3,Olympus Zuiko 35mm macro lens,"Overall this is a good lens. Affordable, compact and very light weight. IQ is also good and it has great macro capabilities. So, you may ask, why I'm rating it *** only? The reason is because AF when using it as a macro lens is very difficult to achieve and very inaccurate. You need to take many shots of the object moving the camera slightly each time and with luck one shot will be focused right where you wanted. You also need to get very very close to the subject, which is OK when photographing flowers but not as good with insects and other live creatures. The lens becomes attractive more because of its low cost (compared to other Zuiko lenses) and the fact that it can be used for portrait and general purpose photography (keep in mind that a 35mm lens on a 4/3 system is in reality 70mm). Again, recommended only if you are on a budget and want to have a small, compact macro lens without spending a lot of $$$."
4,Good lens,"I'm an amateur photographer. Just received my lens a couple of days ago, I have take some test shots and these are my pros and consGood:- Quality of images- Very light-weighted- Is a small lens, so it's easy to carry on my bag.- Great priceNot so good:- Auto-focus is almost unusable, at least you are using a tripod and your subject is not moving.- The lens fit on my Olympus E620 is not great, when I put it or remove it from my camera, I feel that need to use some extra effort compared to my other lenses.My opinion, a good lens at a great price, excellent for amateur photography."
4,pEREDECT LENS,DOES WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO. ONCE MORE HOW MUCH DO YOU WRITE ABOUT A WIDE ANGLE LENS. IH HAS DISTORTION AS ALL
5,Better than expected,"The product description indicates close focus to 6 inches. But guess what? If I put my E510 into manual focus, this lens will extend out and allow close focus down to about 1 inch! That's right...one inch. In auto focus, the lens does not extend. And, yes, quite sharp. Lovely lens."
3,Digital Lens,"Although I haven't had the chance to try this lens out that much, it seems to be a decent piece of equipment."
1,Maybe I got a bad one,"Price OK. Delivery speed excellent. Condition fine.This monitor did not sync for me most of the time.Sceptre support says use email but all their addresses bounce.Phone answerer says ""what is the meaning of 'sync'?""Yes I saw it sync several times in windoze and in linux, even at 1280x1024, and usually on a text screen. Beautiful when it did, but to receive a non-working unit is just not cool."
5,Hot Sexy Music,"If you're a fan of Chus and Ceballos sensual rythms, you will love this double CD. Amazing vibes, one after the other."
2,A litle one track minded but interesting,"2.5 stars - In my opinion as one album and one slab of music it does not travel anywhere. Individual songs are good but as a slab of music it lacks direction and did not take me on a journey, sometimes i tuned in but most of the time i tuned out only brought back to the music for a few sounds or tracks that grabbed my attention - I prefer to listen to this album on shuffle and with other albums mixed in, probably not what the intention of a mix CD is for."
3,Teaching responsibility,"we've been trying to teach our son how to take care of his toys and put them away when finished. this little cartridge holder works great because he likes having something resembling a wallet- like the big guys.He enjoys playing with the Juice Box, its accessories & other versatile products from amazon."
5,Herbs for Hep C and the Liver,excellent breakdown of herbs to be used and goals to be achieved I am glad I purchased the book excellent resources
2,Challenging to use,"While good in theory, these are not so good in practice. The ""non-slip mat"" is cheap and does not hold the letters in place. I have tried multiple non-slip surfaces, and my son (4 1/2) still has to hold down the letter with one hand while tracing with the other - awkward. I wish the letters were more weighted or had a more rubber (gripping) than plastic (slippery) backing."
4,How come nobody's raving about this?,"I'm not a music reviewer, but when I went to the Amazon listing to get some more info on this great band I found virtually nothing there. No reviews, few sales. That's a shame because this is a great pop record of confidence and maturity. Every song is nice, the lead singer has a great understated voice, good hooks, and when all 37 minutes are over I can't help from pressing the repeat button to hear it again. It's good stuff and certainly worth a listen. I can't imagine anyone who's a fan of adult-sounding pop not enjoying this. Thanks."
2,Stay away from Toshiba's!,"This PDA is one of the worst Windoze PDA's out there and has not user replaceable battery. It will be a paper weight in 1.5 yrs.Battery life is very low per charge, it will stay more on the power adaptor than in use. Useless on long trips.The Windoze OS is a bad idea for handhelds. Comparing raw MHz/MB or advertized feature set is not a good idea with PDA's. (8MB on Palm OS does more than 64MB on bloated Windoze.) All the cool features look great for first few weeks and then the gadget might stay in your drawer!Easy of use, reliability, battery life and intuitive software (like a Nokia) are more important than voice recording, mp3 playback and video. Check out the ""Zen of Palm"" if you aren't convinced that Palm OS is much better.Toshiba support for their PDA's is horrible and build quality is poor. I think I have given enough warning to stay away from this. If you desperately want a PC in your Pocket buy an iPaq."
3,"Nice PDA, but SDIO is not supported","I picked up one of these in October. It's an excellent Pocket PC for the price, but you get what you pay for. The non-replacable battery means that this unit is disposable once the battery wears out. Also, they advertise that this unit has an SDIO slot. This is an outright lie. The SD slot supports SD memory, and Toshiba SD peripherals, but not devices that conform to the SDIO standard."
2,Oversized Gift Bag,"Decorative and lightweight. But it's nothing more than a very large, waterproof gift bag. It's stiff and crinkly (and loud). For the price, you can find something better as a beach bag."
2,Pattern delivered was not the one ordered,"This is a huge bag....but the one they delivered is not the one I ordered. In fact, the pattern I received was not even pictured on the Amazon description. Quality control issues."
2,Disappointed,"I loved this bag. It was exactly what I wanted...lightweight, roomy, water resistant. I was so disappointed to realize that after less than a month the material right next to the straps was ripping on three of the four straps! I was using it as a pool bag so it was packed with several towels, goggles, sunscreen. Nothing heavy that would have stressed the material too much. Returned it for a refund."
4,"Very useful, Keeps its shape makes it easy to manage and sort items inside","I am involved in many outdoor sports, and find this very useful in transporting gear, more useful than a duffel bag.You can pile a bunch of things inside, and if anything gets wet it stays open to dry out.As long as something is inside, it's stiff shape keeps it standing up, even in a breeze.Because it is so tall, it holds a lot of stuff, and when you get it home its easy to put on a shelf and just leave it there.I must have over 12 of these already."
5,Love!,"Another terrific bargain. Excellent quality, beautiful trendy green and blue colors - perfect for summer! This bag will hold tons for a trip to the beach...can't wait to use it!"
3,Good product- pricey,"My 3 year old tends to scatter his toys about the house (like most his age) and I was looking for an attractive, sturdy tote bag that would match my living room and be easy to carry around when we clean up his toys. This bag works great, but wouldn't you know it, the next week my girlfriend came over with a bag just as nice. She had purchased it at Trader Joes for a few bucks- figures! Anyway, for a plastic tote bag it is strong and does do a good job holding heavy toys."
5,The Fix,I like this product very much. I already had a Kodak printer dock from another Kodak camera. This little device saved me the expense of buying another camera dock printer. Thank you very much Kodak.
3,Kodak D-22 Dock Adapter Kit,The adapter works fine. It does not fit as firmly as our other camera but having read the other reviews I was aware of that when I purchased it.
1,Adapter not worth buying,"Adapter not worth buying. I had the original dock that got lost. I bought this adapter but it doesn't work. This is simply an adapter docking plate. It's only a docking adapter plate that you use to put on your dock. If you lost your dock, then you're wasting your money buying this."
1,D-22 ADAPTER FOR 6000 SERIES DOCK DOESN'T FIT,"MY OLD KODAK 6340 USED A SERIES 6000 DOCK FOR TRANSFERRING PHOTOS TO THE COMPUTER AND ALSO DID A TERRIFIC JOB OF CHARGING THE BATTERIES. I BOUGHT A NEW KODAK Z812 CAMERA AND WAS TOLD THAT I'D NEED THE D-22 ADAPTER FOR THE 6000 DOCK. SINCE THE STORE DIDN'T HV THE ADAPTERS IN STOCK, I ORDERED IT ON THE INTERNET. THE DARN THING DOESN'T FIT THE 6000 DOCK AND IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. SINCE I ORDERED IT ON THE INTERNET, IF I WANT TO RETURN IT I'LL HV TO PAY THE SHIPPING. I'M PISSED ABT THIS, TO SAY THE LEAST."
1,This ITEM is diferent to the picture,"The article that receipt is difrente to that of the photo that appears. The conector to the camera is not USB/Fire Wire, but it is a type nini Stereo."
1,$50 is like buying Windows 98,Obviously I waited too long to get this adapter and now we shall have to get rid of the dock. The camera that fit it is no longer working. Kodak changed specs in the middle of the product cycle and then did not continue to support the prior versions.
1,bad docking unit,"i have called the seller two times, i need to send it back --i can not get it to work ,,i hope they take it back as i took it on a trip to nogales az with me ,,"
1,Kodak D-22 Dock Adapter Kit,"The adapter fit the dock ok, but when I connect the camera, the dock lights for 2 seconds and then goes out. The camera doesn't charge or start the Kodak software. I'm not happy with the device at all.Dave C."
5,Superb scholarly text,"This was my 2nd purchase from Amazon back in 1999. You couldn't find this book anywhere else at the time. I'm glad it's been reprinted.This is a wonderful book, describing in great detail the spread of the cult of Isis throughout the ancient world, and the contributions to our modern society. It's a little dry, but there really is nothing else out there like this book. I have a vast library of books on Ancient Egypt and this is the one I value the most."
4,nice use of space,easy to assemble and a nice combination of storage space for my toddler. I have books in the magazine rack and toys in the bins.It also stacks well on top of the Ikea dresser I have- unitl the little guy is big enough to pull it down.
4,French learner,"Overall this is a good book that tackles some of the tougher language issues (tenses etc), it's generally well organized, but it doesn't have an index. If you are looking for a specific phrase--good luck, you have to search by the general topics in table of contents."
3,Living Language French Coursebook revised & updated c.1993,The speaker spoke too fast. It is difficult for a beginner to follow. It may be useful to those who have studied French to use it for a through review.
3,I expected more... maybe it was my fault,"The travel organizer is bigger than I expected which was a nice surprise, but it has less room to write than I expected and a lot pages with ""useful"" tips that are not that useful for an experinced traveller. I expected more... maybe it was my fault."
4,Perfect for the trip,"The notebook was perfect for my trip to Europe last month.. great tips and ideas, and plenty of space to jot the whole trip down.."
4,Nice amplifier for the price you pay!!!,"I've bought and tried out this amplifier today and I am loving it. I am using it for my Keyboard Casio WK-3300 and it is well worth it's money. You can use it as well for the Guitar. I have 2 small children so it is very nice, that it comes with a plug-in for headphones, so when you practice the others won't be disurbed. It has 20 Watts and it is more then I actually needed, but you never know where I might will use it. It also comes with an input for CD/MP3. I only give it a 4 Star, because there are better ones out there, but those are also much more expensive. All together: For the price you pay this is one of the best ones out there!!!"
3,Doesn't Show Off Garth's Compositional Ability,"I'm a big fan of The Band and Garth Hudson, and after seeing Garth improvise so brilliantly on the ""making of the Brown Album"" DVD, I expected his CD to be full of the same sort of stuff. Complex chord changes, sophisticated melody lines, tons of snakey keyboard runs...that's what I expected. And to be fair, the last song does fall into that category...it's terrific.But the rest of the album relies too heavily on jamming, studio trickery, and input from other people aside from Hudson. With a mind as brilliant as Garth's at your disposal, why record a lengthy jam session based on a boring 2-chord progression? Why insert trippy overdubs and noises, when hearing Garth simply PLAY is much more exciting.Wanted to love this, but didn't. Maybe you will."
4,"Truly unique, musical music","This is the unique album of the year. A solo record fromGarth Hudson is something I never expected. It's good thathe's working because two of the Band's three singers aredeceased, and the third, Levon Helm, can't sing because ofcancer. When I heard Garth would do a solo CD I anticipatedthat it would be new age music, not my favorite, but I wouldbuy it anyway because it would be Garth. But I was surprisedand impressed by the music, consistently. This isa sometimes quiet and subdued set of compositions but also powerful, colorful, and bold. Any of the songs, withthe exception of the ""Dark Star"" cover, which never seems to goanywhere for me, could be expanded to a piece covering a wholeCD. One could say it sounds like world music but that isn'tquite right, even though it's rich with influences from Asia, Africa, and Europe. And yet it manages to sound like The Bandin spirit--can't really say how, but it's there."
4,Eclectic,"I was surprised by this album, which shouldn't have surprised me because there was no telling how Garth Hudson's first album was going to sound. Other than, of course, being excellent. He plays almost a dozen different instruments, touches on many different styles of music from different eras and continents, and gives a good display of his eccentric genius.If you like this, and if you have an open mind you should, try the albums Largo and Stay Awake which both feature gorgeous instrumentals by Garth."
3,"Nicely, nicely....ummm...","This is one of those ""I really wanted to like this album"" reviews. And I did want to like it, insofar as Garth Hudson is a master musician who was the unassuming ""glue"" to The Band and their albums. He's also done guest turns for other performers that both compliment them quite well and shine as Hudson's own moments. Unfortunately, his first solo album, is...immaculate and that's about it. Nothing offends, but nothing really engages you either, certainly not on the level of Hudson's previously-mentioned musical contributions. Maybe you have to hear it late at night just before you retire for the album to kick in. But that leaves you in danger of snozzing through most of it. Sorry to say, but ""immaculate,"" ""pleasant"" and ""nice"" just don't translate into ""interesting"" in this case."
1,I would have given this book a zero star rating if allowed,"I am 52 year old grandmother and I purchased this book from another vendor for my granddaughter without reading it first. I remember being bullied all through school. I wish that I had handled the bullying differently than I did. Instead, I handled it pretty much the same way Jake did...not with the same results though. I wish that I HAD told my parents. I wish that I HAD told my teacher. I wish that I HAD trusted someone to help me out. Jake reinforces all of the ""old school"" stereo types...don't tell, telling will make it worse. Kids should not be afraid to talk to their parents or to their teacher. Kids should not be told that ""tattleing"" is wrong. The person bullying, for WHATEVER reason, is WRONG. Kids, ask for help! Parents, help your kids. I usually donate used books to my local library. This book will be thrown in the trash."
5,Jake Drake bully buster,"I read Jake Drake bully buster.It is a great book and if you asked me to give you up to five stars it would be five stars.I thought that it was a great book and that ages 8 and up would be a great age to be reading this book. The writer of the book made you really get into the book you would not want to stop reading it. I would recommend this book to everyone and I would say if you like Jake Drake bully buster try reading the other books too. The book is about bully's and being mean (which we should not do). One of the charters is Link he was 8 years old and wanted to be the MVP on the bully ""all star team"" and I think all kid's would say he made the team. Link was a brat to Jake and Jake was sick of being messed around with and just wanted his class to be ""bully free"" but I guess that couldn't happen."
5,Jake drake review for me,"I liked this book, because I found it to be a good book.. The character Jake had a big problem. When I was reading the book, I had to keep reading to find out what happened next. If I could read anther book by Andrew Clement I would. He is a good a author."
3,"""The Mean People""","It is a good book.The book is about this boy that likes to pick on people.He picked on Jake.He likes to make fun of people like Jake.The little boy thinks that he is all that,but he is not.Well i think you should read this book.The book is coming of age.The boys name is Link.Well Link and Jake both have sisters.Well Link's sister likes to pick on Jakes sister .Well I think that they should not pick on people like that.They do that because they think that it makes them cool.But it doesn't it makes they look stupid.well i think that you should read this book."
2,READ,"This book is about a boy who is getting picked on a lot, but then he gets picked on by a super bully. He has to get rid of him. How do think he can get rid of him? If you want to find out, then read the book."
1,DO NOT BUY!! THIS TOY IS AWFUL!!,"I recently purchased the Spider-Man Stunt System for my son at Toys R Us for Christmas.Let me just start off by saying that your company has a lot of nerve for even attempting to sell this toy. It is really not a toy at all, but rather the equivalent of being robbed. The toy does NOT work as advertised, AT ALL. I have a 6 year old who day in and day out wanted this piece of CRAP toy since September and whose heart was broken when it simply DID NOT WORK AT ALL. I am not the only person to have the same issues. Other disgruntled parents are having the same issues. [...][...]MUCH THANKS FOR RUINING MY 6 year olds Christmas morning. We will be sure we never buy a TOY BIZ product ever again.I also happen to be a mechanical engineer incase you are wondering if it is ""just me."""
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,Save yourself some $$$. This toy sucks. I bought it for my son for Christmas 04. Let me tell you that this thing sucks plain and simple. 1. Spiderman actually goes from post to post 1 out of 20 times. 2. The so called traps that come with this toy such as the web dropping and the platform in which the bad guy is supposed to stand on is crap. Complete CRAP. It hardly stays up and when it does a little tiny tap will make it fall down again. This will ONLY frustrate the living crap out of your child. I wish I did not even purchase this and spent my money on something else like a game for his Playstation 2 or XBox.
2,READ REQUIREMENTS FOR SOFTWARE,Hate it!! Upon installing I found out I needed several other quite expensive programs :( I would not suggest this kit to anyone b/c it doesn't work with protools
4,ezdrummer,"Decent plug-in drumer sampler. Had some trouble getting two of the parts to work correctly, but sounds good and overall works fine. Have since found other plug-ins I like better, but this one is good for the price."
2,Awesome if you can get it to install,"Let me first start by saying that EZDrummer does what it promises to do very well. I installed the software on my Windows XP PC and it worked perfectly, delivering very convincing drum sounds for my home recordings. However, when I attempted to install it on my laptop which runs Windows 7 (the computer I bought it for), my opinion of it quickly soured. It won't install. Ive tried several different workarounds like copying the files from the disk to the hard drive and downloading the software from the Toontracks website. Nothing works. I keeps returning the same annoying error message. Toontracks recognizes that the software is incompatible and has a beta patch on their support page. However, that does me no good if I can't install the program so I can patch it.So while I think EZDrummer is a terrific software package, I can't recommend it to anyone with a Windows 7 (and I'm guessing Vista) PC."
1,Be prepared to spend a lot of money.,First of all you need Midi Sequencer software to use this product. If you don't have one be prepared to spend $100 to $500 for a descent one. The registration process for this product is very tedious and requires many steps. And after I have done all this the program still doesn't work. My Midi Sequencer can't find the EZ Drummer plug in (wasted $150 on that). I even downloaded Toontracks free Midi Sequencer and even it can't find the plug-in. So basically I have invested approximately $300 for absolutely nothing. If you are lucky enough to get it to work it does sound great.
3,Not enough bang for your buck...,"Ok, to start, this is a virtual instrument, and the sound quality is pretty stinking good. All of the drums sound like real drums, none of those fake digital drum sounds.That being said, I feel like I should've gotten more drums for the price. Expansion kits are almost as expensive as the program itself (which is ridiculous), and you only get two main kits to start out with, maybe 40-50 drums total. If they started you with double that, I'd probably give it 4 stars. If their expansions were cheaper, I'd give it four stars.As it stands, 3 stars. It's good at what it does, but it's disappointing how few options you start with."
5,fun and easy to use,Great product I don't know a ton about music but this software makes it easy for me to run through beats to find something that matches my song. Planning on getting the drumkit from hell also. Great price on amazon as well
5,I'm very happy with this little camera.,"I had this camera for a while now, and after using it on vacation I have to say it's really great. We bought this camera so we would not have to take our larger one on vacation with us.I was surprised at how much smaller then my old one it really was. Despite being so small and light, this camera, takes surprisingly good pictures. In normal lighting, S1's pictures are sharp and very accurate in color. I was impressed with the beautiful 2.5 inch rear display. I'm very happy overall with this little camera. It's easy to take everywhere you go, fits in your pocket, and the pictures are surprisingly good."
1,Every Single Picture Is Blurred,"It has a blur warning, thats great, but whats the point if EVERY SINGLE PICTURE TAKEN IS BLURRED? I have never taken an unblurred picture with this camera unless the flash is on. For some reason any change with the flash will cause the hand shake warning to come on permanently. I cannot manage to hold the camera steady enough even when I sit it down and don't even touch it. I'm not sure if it's something I'm doing wrong or if this particular camera is defective. I'm really upset I spent money on this camera since the whole reason I baught a new one was because my old one was always blurry and would always have a delay before capturing a picture - causing me to miss the best shots. I'm confused and bewildered as to how this camera managed to get 5 stars from anybody."
2,More White Spots...appearing,"I broke my last digital camera, Sony Cybershot DSC93 (Fantastic Camera), so I had high expectations for its replacement. This Camera was no where near what I wanted. I did some in-depth research about this camera and MOST reviews were great. I purchased this camera and less than a week later it was returned. The outside picutres where great, I was happy with those. It not until you come indoors and take photos that you see the major flaws. Once loaded on the computer, you can notice white spots, almost like water droplets that appear through the pictures. (There is another review here about the same spots). I tried changing the settings and nothing.I ended up purchasing the Sony DSC M1...Sony has done it again with another fantastic camera. It's a little expensive, but it's worth it. Also a great conversation starter for its unique design. :)"
2,Nikon has disappointed me,"I had an old Nikon camera and it worked fine for 3 years so I decided to buy more from the same brand. This camera is slim and pretty, however the pictures are not great. Besides, three weeks after I bought it, it started having some problems with the buttons, they wouldn't work properly. If this was a one time defect, it would be all right, but I recently had problems with another Nikon model, so I would recommend to buy another brand. I also own Sony T33, that is the same style as this camera, however it takes mucha better pictures, the LCD has a better resolution and so does the movie mode. Besides it's only like 30 dollars more."
3,Photos are so-so,"I bought this camera for my husband at Christmas and we were both very disappointed. The quality of photos compared to our Canon and Kodak digital cameras (both of which are 3 to 5 years old!) is not that great. Colors seemed a bit lifeless. The camera is fantastically slim, which was a big attraction for us. But the LCD viewer, although big, is not great. Photos that looked great on the viewer did not look great when downloaded to our computer. I would not recommend this camera if you like to print and share your photos."
3,Nikon coolpix,"It is the 3 camera that I buy, I like it very mutch.But the third one I bought have a problem: the shuter broke almost 3 weeks after I gave it to my daughter and I don't know how to have it fix.Nikon Coolpix S1 5.1 MP Slim-Design Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Includes Dock)"
2,Blurry Pictures,"Camera is a great size and takes great picutres, as long as you use the flash. ANY pictures taken without the flash are blurry, even if using a tripod! This forces you to take indoor pictures with the flash, which makes it seem like you're outside at night when you view the picture."
3,nice camera --let down by week flash,"This is a fine camera, with the exception of limited range for the flash. Anything beyond 8 ft is not illuminated."
1,Fragile screen--watch out!,"After 2 months of normal use the camera monitor cracked internally and Nikon charged me $150 to fix it, no warranty. I did not abuse the camera--put it in my pocket on a few hikes. The monitor is big, and I believe that makes it fragile and prone to breakage. Buy a hard case and keep the monitor protected. Nikon does not provide a case."
1,White spots in dark areas in low light,"I just received this camera from Amazon.com today. Very small camera. I love the feel of it.However, it is TRUE and SAD. I tried using this camera to test the white spots in dark areas in night, in the rooms with very little light, using in-built flash, as reported by other users on this site. I do see random white spots in the pictures.. very irritating and you don't expect this from a company like Nikon.I am now contacting amazon to return this camera. I hope that I do not have to pay any restocking fees as this is a permanent defect in this model. Even other users have noticed this, please check other low rated reviews here from other users.I will not recommend this camera to any one due to this one issue. I am loading some pictures taken from this camera with white spots on amazon.com, please do check them above."
2,Beautiful but limited,"I was disappointed by this book. There are beautiful photographs of almost every item, but the total number of recipes is less than 40. A few recipes I did not find feasible as gifts--for example there are two recipes for bouquet garni which must be assembled, given and used immediately by the recipient (something no friend of mine would appreciate!). Also, no suggestions were provided for the containers or wrapping/displaying of the items, though the pictures do provide some inspiration. You are directed to a website for canning/processing information which may be fine for those familiar with this process. I was unclear whether the storage information reflected canning/processing or not. However, the book is very attractive and the recipes look tasty. The author provides a few suggestions for use of the condiments."
5,Ideas You Won't Find Elsewhere,"This book offers great ideas for homemade gifts you won't find anywhere else (Sugar Mice, Orange Brandy Butter) and some not so-unusual combinations such as Chocolate Gingerbread that makes you wonder why you didn't think of it yourself. I like that many of the recipes don't require cooking/baking and the simplistic yet elegant packaging is an inspiration for any wrapping project. I doubt I would use all the recipes, but then I never do from any of my books. The photographs are luscious! The book by itself would make an excellent gift."
4,Wilderness,"I have read several books that included the bear attack and abandoning of Hugh Glass but never before in detail. I do not know how accurate the details of the book are but I suspect that the author has added a lot of incidents that may or may not have happened as written. Overall I enjoyed reading it, knowing in the beginning that it was Jim Bridger who had abandoned Hugh. I wonder about the meeting of the two after Hugh's ordeal and if he actually forgave Jim for abandoning him. I also learned a lot about John Colter and his relationship to Lewis & Clark."
1,Save your money,I bought this video and wish I could get my money back. It is basically a rehash of the owner's manual. Read the manual and use your unit and that's all you really need.
2,Poorly Written,"Being a fan of John Burchett's crime novels with their Thai setting, this really pales by comparison. It's poorly written and plodding, really lacking in good narrative skill. The protagonist isn't a well-developed character and the story doesn't engage. So many books, so little time, so don't bother with this one."
3,If You Have Not Experienced Thailand Its Not For You,I loved reading this murder mystery sand its underlying entry into the Thai mind set. Be prepared for the twist at the end - like Thailand not is all as it seems
3,topeak panoram v12 cycle computer,"Installation was easy. But, the instructions that came with the computer on how to program it were very vague. I still have not been able to program the clock. The other readings work fine."
3,Good Idea - Poor Execution,"I liked the concept of seeing all the information on a large screen, but the unit has given me some problems. I have had to replace the sensor battery about every two or three months. Also, at times, I get ""bouncing"" speed readouts, which can't be accurate. Finally the Panoram along with many other bike computer companies, seem to have given up trying to write or illustrate good operating directions. The Panoram literature is no exception, the directions are very poor. I think I will probably go back to a unit that is wired. I'm still searching for a good bike computer that is easy to set up, easy to use and keeps doing the job."
1,not recommended,"I don't recommend this camera because it's not functional at night, the beam is way to focused so you can only see a very small portion of the crib. I would not buy it. The only positives is the sound and the alarm if your baby starts to cry."
3,Not as high-tech as they advertize,"I bought this item because it seemed to be more professional than the true baby monitors, which seem to command a premium because they are blue and cute. Nevertheless, the product has disappointed because it is so sensitive to interference, including when we turn on the microwave in another room about 20-25 feet away from both the monitor and camera. The colors are also very poor and I have seen much better quality (and with less interference) on other baby monitors.Otherwise, it's an ok product and we've particularly enjoyed the setting whereby it comes on when the camera detects a loud noise (such as crying)."
4,Remote Camera and Receiver,"Product works very well considering the fact that it has to go thru about 5 or six walls that are structured in steel. If it works this good in an environment that has a lot of interference, it should work great in normal environments."
1,SVAT GX5201 Wireless Video monitor,This product sucks! It interfers with everthing else electronic in this houselold. Please don't waste your money like I was stupid enough to.
3,"Okay, Not very user friendly","This camera is okay, but not very user friendly. I was looking for a plug and play camera to monitor my baby at night. This is not the right choice. Quality of the product is pretty good, but setting it up takes more time than the average person wants to spend. The biggest problem i have with the product is that you have to take the battery's OUT to plug in the AC adapter!? I have never seen that before."
4,Very Good Baby-Manitor,"It is a very good and useful baby monitor, specially because it does not get any other interference with any signal from other eletronic devices. The image is good and it also shows the image from the darkness of a room. The sound quality should be better, but, if you are sleeping you really don`t need much sound around. I use mine specially to watch my baby."
4,Satisfied,The Video is high quality but there is substantial interferance which creates alot of static in the audio and some static in the video. I was impressed with the quality of the night vision.
4,Better than expected,"Pretty happy with this product. Chose this based on reviews and the ability to expand it to multiple cameras. Want this to double both as a baby monitor as well as security cameras for the house. Initial use was as a baby monitor. The picture is clearer than expected, and the night vision was also better than expected. Even in low light I can get a good enough picture to see what I need. The colors are not accurate, as the brown wooden crib appears light blue. Nevertheless, the accurate color reproduction is not what I bought the camera for. There is noticeable static and line distortion the farther away you get, and this is probably not great to use as something you leave on all night by your bedside unless you in a very nearby room. The wireless router also creates noticeable distortion - surfing the web and sending emails create additional static whenever data is sent or received. Overall though I am happy with it."
2,Not the greatest!,The picture quality is not great at all. I still can't get the product to work through the electrical outlet... so constantly putting batteries in it and they are not lasting at all. Overall I wish I would have went with another model... I am not happy with this product at all!
1,Too much static,"This product did not work well in our house, almost as soon as I left our child's bedroom, we got static and the screen rolling, and with each step down the hallway it got worse. I tried various settings and still had the problem. There is no way I could have slept with this monitor on in our bedroom with all the static."
3,It works. But poor range,"First of all, it works. When the monitor is within a short range, the picture quality is reasonably good, even though the colors are not that accurate. Night mode is okay as well. Audio reception is alright. The camera is so small and light weight that it's better fixed on a wall than being kept on a table or something. The monitor stand is a good thing and the monitor can also be wall-mounted.The biggest problem is with the range. The picture reception is good for just about 50 ft, no more than that. The product description says 300 ft and ideal is 100 ft. But the results I see are nowhere close to that.The other problem is with the channel selection. In case you forget to select the correct channel on the monitor, then you keep loosing signal. But I won't call this a real problem since selecting the right channel solves the problem."
3,Not worth the price,"SVAT CX5201 Wireless Portable Video MonitorThe monitor works fine with the power adapter but does not work with batteries as it's supposed to do. The camera is OK for low light as it has infrared LEDS but the field of vision is limited, would be fine for baby watching but not enough to see around the crib if someone else is in the room until the person is by the crib."
2,Not worth the price,"I was very eager to get this set after getting the dress from the regular survival kit as a hand me down. The problem I have with the warm weather set of clothing is that its designed for tall women. The pants are several inches too long (I'm 5'2, which is not all that short, esp with shoes!) The dress hangs off me like a sack, even though I am 7 months along. I have gotten a good bit of use out of the skirt and shirt, so its not a total loss. However the shirt no longer fits since I have gone from an A to a C cup. I imagine anyone who began her pregnancy with a medium to large sized bust won't be able to wear it for more than a couple of months. If I had to do it over I would have used the $150 to buy nice individual items that would have actually fit! I wouldn't recommend this set unless you can try it on before purchasing."
2,Eh.,"I received this as a gift, and I was pretty disappointed. The skirt and pants are great and I wear them all the time, but the shirt and dress never fit right, even toward the end of my pregnancy. I definitely would not buy this set for myself, since it's so expensive. Instead I'd get the pants and skirt separately. I bought similar pants from another website for $15, and I'm sure a similar skirt is out there for under $50."
1,Had a future if she worked the voice very hard ........,"Nice lower register and mid-range, but her voice is too weak - Chrissie Hynde without the power. And the songs are a problem - self-indulgence is a career killer."
1,Not for me,This was recommended by a friend who is usually a reliable source. I found it annoying and gave it to him.
4,Best Impersonation Ever,"Highest-quality reverse-engineered followers in the tracks of the King. If you have not heard the originals in a long while this will validate your memories note-for-note. In that the originals are widely available cannot see the reason for this however, except to promote bookings. Distinctly reverential, unlike many dishonoring the virtuous purity of The Great One's memory in polycarbonate and visually on black velvet on trailer walls."
3,Limp,"I enjoy the size but it is too limp like half as firm as it should be, you can mount it to a wall but due to the lack of firmness it is useless."
4,Tool-Making,I ordered this book to find plans and methods to make woodworking tools to use at the 1790 village I do demonstrations at. I thought if I made more of the tools I use it would add to the visitors experience. This book works for me. I am happy with the content and methods presented.
5,"Zolar X ""Timeless""","After sometime of hearing a substandard bootleg CD of this,it was a delight to hear Zolar X in all their galactic glory.A band of legend in LA in the 70's,Zolar X wore their space suits and prosthetic ears wherever they went....a criminally neglected band,AT has rectified this by releasing ""Timeless"" in its remastered glory,with TONS of bonus tracks....how these guys were never huge is one of musics great mysterys,as the CD ROCKS HARD!A band totally devoted to their trip,it should not be missed by any fan of 70's hard rock/glam/protopunk....my pick for 2004! Monger Martian Marauder unit X-110030 Zolarian Space Commission"
4,GREAT ROCK CD,"Almost all reviews are correct. Great classic rock that will stand the test of time. Great playing, outstanding songs and a great varity of material. MAGNOLIA is almost worth the price alone, but there really isn't one bad track on this CD. Just one thing spoils the fun to some extent and that's the singers total lack of subtlty. He obviously hates to be quite and it shows. Even when it isn't called for he fills all spaces available to him with over the top vocal stylings ( often totaly out of context with the song ). I have 2 SCW cd's and they both suffer from this affliction. These would both be 5 star offerings if they could quiten the singer down when he isn't required. Unfortunately I had to take this of the WIFE FRIENDLY list in my collection. She can't get past the singing to get to the very good bits. Looking at the very low 2nd hand prices, it seems other people have the same problem. If it wasn't for the singing this band would almost be guaranteed greater success."
4,Solid Survey,"Eckert has provided a solid survey history of the peninsula that stands as a reliable introduction to the politics and culture of Korea in a single volume. As with most surveys, fascinating intrigues and cultural depth are sacrificed in order to provide an overview of the essentials. It is an excellent introductory text, written in a lucid style noteworthy for its clarity of expression. David R. Bannon, Ph.D., author ""Race Against Evil."""
1,"If you're a hateful, narrowminded loon, then this book is for you!","Thankfully, I didn't have to buy this piece of garbage - I just read through it in a book store. To say that this is a work of fiction is an understatement. In short, the author takes turns pointing to various groups and calling them the devil in order to play to the fears of its intended audience. It's a conspiracy theory, wrapped in bigotry, with no basis at all in reality.If you're looking for something that ""seems"" kind of official to validate your radical religious right hatred of homosexuals, civil libertarians, and anyone not like you, and if you aren't concerned that your validation comes without any actual reality to back it up, then this is a must read. If, on the other hand, you're into actual facts, steer clear of this load of inflammatory garbage."
1,Pure Right Wing Garbage - Don't Waste Your Money!,"Pure unsubstanciated tripe which, in typical right wing fashion, scapegoats Homosexuals as practically the source of all evil.Funny how the right claims it's only about 2-3% which are Homosexual, it amazes to think how much they endanger the other 97% of the population <eyes roll>.For those moronic enough to believe this nonsense, you have my prayers. :)"
5,must read,i could not put this book down. once you understand the pack of lies that have brought us to the cultural breakdown you will want to confront this evil and stop it from progressing any further. i felt angry betrayed horrified and sickened and empowered after reading this. lies have become truths and truths lies to force feed this evil agenda to us. shame on them and shame on us for not waking up sooner.
5,Truth Unleashed,"The way Kupelian writes is phenomenal, his footnotes are extensively accurate, and his research superb. I love that people reading this book wanting to sell our country down the river of communism will no doubt be left feeling uneasy, and squirming in their own skin. Kupelian takes the reader, sometimes by the hand, and shows them point by point why we need to remember our heritage as Americans, and see what has happened since traditional values have been thrown out the window, to further a free-for-all society, that has decayed from the inside out. If you ever question the church and state being linked, (for the GOOD!) please read this book. You'll see the truth, or you will go on with the blinders being passed out in today's high schools, and colleges, being run by true socialists who want nothing more than the integration of our great nation into the United Nations. Give this book to everyone you know, you'll thank me."
5,A Must Read Book!,"The socialist in this country no doubt cannot stand this book even exists, however thinking people will find the book an eye opener! The reviewers who didn't like the book are obviously hard core leftist of the George Soros variety. If you value traditional American values, this book is for you!"
1,Wish I could give zero stars!,"Mr. Kupelian appears to be the one promoting evil here. Bigotry, intolerance, and HIS elitism over minorities in society is disgusting! Disguising hatred as freedom is his evil."
1,The Evil of Marketing,"This book is full of outright distortions re:1. Margaret Sanger and abortion - falsely attributed quotes, non-sequitir arguments, and disingenuous distortions.2. The ""gay rights"" movement - see above3. The ""father"" of the sexual revolution - um, see above.Geez, people - do your own research. That is unless you really enjoy reading books that already align perfectly with your skewed worldview. The author wrote this book with a goal in mind - propagandizing and disseminating long discredited myths and ostensibly doing so in the form of some grand revelation of deep, dark secrets. Get real.Yawn - sorry, we know who wages the real propaganda campaigns with fake commercials, AM Radio, The K Street Project, Fox News, Anne Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, ""think tanks"",books like this one and the tripe David Horowitz types up, etc.In any case, I get the feeling that this author is preaching to the choir, and they've all got kool aid stained lips."
1,marketing of evil,After reading the book I discovered the author was often labeling the wrong things as evilbeing sold. I gave the book the lowest reading I know how to give it. I tossed the book into the trash.
1,"A Good Idea for a Book, But This Isn't It","While a scholarly examination of the problems associated with modern American materialism and mass-marketing would be a terrific book, this one is merely a lengthy and extremely shrill rant about everything which the American Right (particularly the Religious Right) find objectionable in society.Read the list of blurbs...who's endorsing this book. Malkin? Wildmon? Limbaugh? Names like that tell you everything you need to know, and why you should look elsewhere if it's a serious discussion you want.A truly despicable book."
4,"worthwhile read, but some shortcomings","Overall a good effort in identifying to Americans how their thoughts have been manipulated on many issues. Other reviewers have previously covered these issues in some detail.Where the book does fall short in its search for truth, (important for Kupelian), is objectively looking at 9/11, the creation of Israel, the ownership of American major media and the role that the masonic orders have played in influencing the topics that he covers.Please remember one very important thing: presidents that belong to a masonic order are NOT Christian !"
1,Your Kidding Right??,"The Marketing of Evil, the title says it all. Someone found a way to market this book, and it is pure evil! A waste of time and money. Save yourself the time and just and head over to some lunatic right-wing website instead. It would be the same thing. I was expecting an intelligent discussion with facts. Instead I was taken for 20 bucks and was pushed some propaganda!"
5,too much freedom?,"yes. there is such a thing. THis book surely is like holy water dashed on vampires. The vampires being the undead leftists sucking the morality out of humanity like blood. If you hate truth, you will not comprehend this book. If you love it, this book is a must read."
5,The Marketing of Evil,"The book was well documented and honest. The author did a fine job of presenting the facts without twisting them. I would recommend that every American read this book. It is an eye opener and although some of the informatiion in it caused me great sadness, I know that the facts were accurate."
5,A Must Read for Every American!!!!!!!,"I see the critics are proving David Kupelian and his book ""the Marketing of Evil"" to be 100% correct. Its pretty clear, that most of the critics, have not read the book, but are only part of a left wing campaign against this book. Marxism is alive and well in the USA, lets face it. The venom and hate piled up against Mr. Kapelian, should alone, make you want to read this book; Before the lefties try to burn them all, in a non PC book burning party; and pretty much proves his point. David Kupelian has done his homework, and that is why he is taking all this abuse (remember they killed the prophets). When the left cannot refute the evidence (which is pretty much all the time) they attack the truth teller. The Marketing of evil explains how we in the West have follow so far. And leads us in the right direction as what to do to fix what ails us. I say read this book for yourself, and then make up your own mind."
2,Squandered Opportunity,"Much of what David Kupelian writes about in ""The Marketing of Evil"" is deeply troubling. Unfortunately, the book suffers from the same basic problems as the news stories on Mr. Kupelian's website WorldNetDaily: poor writing and an excess of ""spin"". His basic premises may be valid, but the way he puts forth his arguments are completely over-the-top.He also suffers from the delusion that everyone who believes in traditional Judeo-Christian morality also agrees 100% with the Republican agenda when it comes to other issues. There are many religious believers out there who are conservative on sexual morality but liberal on things like the environment, the Middle East, social justice, multiculturalism, etc.It's really too bad that this book wasn't better written, as its message is an important one for people to hear."
4,Book purchase,"Very enlightening for anyone who wants too be well informed of the world in which they belong, and to enhance their relations with others."
4,Thanks One-Star Reviewers!,"When I first heard about this book I had no intention of reading it. It seemed like propaganda to me. But seeing these knee-jerk negative reviews made me ask ""Why do people feel threated by this book?""Within the pages of ""The Marketing of Evil"" Mr. Kupelian presents a strong case that America has been convinced to embrace certains ""rights and freedoms"" that are nothing more than the selfish desires of a relatively small minority. He presents footnoted facts to back up his viewpoint.And it's a great read!I would encourage my fellow Americans to take a chance and read this book. Then draw you own conclusion."
2,By Faith NOT by Works,"A generally good analysis of his topic, but ends up on a very wrong note. The writer has not understood the nature of Truth and Salvation. The last section entitled The Bottom Line is very dangerous and unbiblical. The writer does not know the definition of Everlasting life."
4,"One voice , one mans view",At the end of section 3 he writes that every family should opt for home schooling...what if both parents are rotten in math or high school drop outs themselves. What if family issues ( the birth of another child ) prevents attention and care for teaching...and what if both parents have jobs and work outside the home? But I will agree that the current public school system is toxic with no driving force for faith. I am rewriting my review to say that this book gives anwers to why Americans are brainwashed into being zombie liberals.
4,Some compelling arguments,"I read Kupelian's book and I limit my comments here to the chapter on the gay rights movement. It's a compeling argument: He strings together a a series of documented events that show how we have been manipulated by desensitization, jamming and conversion tricks to the point where homosexuality is accepted as a mainstream force.It's interesting that in all of the comments here and elsewhere by those who oppose him, where are the point-by-point rebuttals? All I read is a bunch of shrill name calling and dismissive one-liners. Is he wrong? Prove it! Are his facts inaccurate? Prove it! (deafening silence..) Hmmm...seems to me Kupelian may be on to something here and those who bash him or his book are left exposed as guilty of the very things he asserts."
4,First Chapter Sets the Stage,"Keupelian shows how out of control social marketing has gotten on shaping topics from abortion to relgious freedom to education. It appears this book was inspired by Paul Rondeau's research ""Selling Homosexuality to America."" My only criticism it that I just wish it had the same depth but this is a minor criticism since Kupelian covers so many issues."
4,An interesting perspective on current culture.,"This book offers a perspective on the current American culture that will make you think a little deeper about WHY you believe what you believe. It might make you wonder if you SHOULD continue to believe it or do more research. It offers references to other books, speeches and televised interviews as support for the perspective on the culture that it is prsenting. It is a good statrting point for those who question the information presented to Americans via the media. An interesteing book."
5,It will affect me forever,"This is perhaps the best and most freeing book I have ever read on the popular culture at large. It rings true at every level, and has changed the way I view things in the most freeing and encouraging way!! I cannot recommend it enough. An absolute masterpiece!!"
4,Very Eye Opening . . .,As a parent of five children and very concerned about their future in America I found this book to be very thorough in what is happening to our culture. I found David Kupelian did an excellent job in untangling every topic. I found myself very stressed out after reading each chapter because it is so thought provoking and actually disturbing to have the truth presented in such a way. I would highly recommend this book.
1,"If I could give this no stars, I would....","According to the description, this should be a book about how marketing is used to persuade us to purchase/believe certain things.In reality, the author uses this book to spew hate. It is filled with right-wing anti-gay, pro-life, anti-diversity, pro-homeschooling, anti-divorce nonsense.I wish I had known about the content of this book before purchasing it. I prefer not to give my money to promote such hatred."
2,Falls short of other resources,"Elite interests are aggressively colonizing the minds of our children. This book covers some of their strategies, but not as thoroughly as Juliet Schor's ""Born to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture."" That book does a better job of revealing the multibillion-dollar marketing effort to turn kids into oversexed, status-obsessed consumers. To get kids, and adults, hooked on various bread and circuses (like pro sports fanaticism) makes it easier for Big Business to continue their takeover of the country.For people who don't have time for a lot of reading, the DVD ""The Merchants of Cool"" covers much of the same sort of material. And if you want your kids to start thinking critically about their media diet, subscribe them to journals like New Moon, Teen Voices, and Adbusters; and get yourselves a subscription to Mothering Magazine and a copy of the DVD ""The Corporation.""There are also good organizations working on these issues, like Commercial Alert."
4,"God, Family, Republic","This book is one that I recommend, but the authour falls short in justifying his own Zionist, Roman Catholic, and Republican short-comings with the same techniques he decries in the book. Lots of good information about Kinsey and infanticide, but does it very best to keep Republican readers from abandoning the Republican Party for the Constitution Party. Decries the Democrats and excuses the Republicans. No mention made about vehicles that one can use to restore our nation."
1,A lesson in marketing to right-wing Christians.,"This is a book that labels rock and roll, homosexuals, cultural diversity, sexual freedom, and all of the other right-wing Christian hot topics as `evil'. It's more of a talking points guide for a tea-party campaign than serious social critique. Don't be fooled by this book's high rating numbers. The special interest groups that pushed ""Atlas Shrugged"" to the top of the century's greatest movies lists are the same folk plugging this book."
4,English Stick Making,"This is a very good book on the subject, and overall it is what a beginner who wants to make sticks needs.Where it falls short is on wood selection - it is limited to England. It does however mention other woods. I would prefer that section to be extended.I have not tried all the techniques mentioned in the book yet, but reading the book makes them sound straight forward.I'd recommend this book to whomever is interested in the subject."
5,Just as described,I was very happy to finally get real hoover bags for my vacuum - what a difference from the generic!!!
5,The best,"Buying Genuine Hoover bags is very important, so I highly recommend these. Hoover makes some of the best products. Great"
3,vacuum bags,Vacuum bags that are hard to find in stores was easy to find on Amazon. Arrived promptly.Happy with the purchase
4,Good old 'Ryche Gospel...,The singer sounds like Geoff Tate. He's really good. I liked this album especially the title track which totally rocks! If you like pre-Empire Queensryche with a bit of a Dokken feel...you'll love this album.
5,the three inch horse,"I bought this dildo and i just love it . The John holms is sold in two typs ur3 and the oridnal model witch i purched this last time . My pick of the two is the ur3 it is so much more life like . But both of them are good , be ready for a good strech though and use lots of lube !! I havent been able to take it to the balls yet but i try every day !!"
3,It's good to get started,"I'd have to say this is a great beginer vibrator. I like something a lot larger. When I have some guys over, they usually want something more endowed. But besides that still a great product."
4,"A Peculiar And Amusing Commentary on Art, in Music!","Who would have thought of combining, on one disk, music by Peter Schickele (the infamous associate of P.D.Q. Bach) based on Thurber's drawings, with music and words based on classic artworks such as ""Christina's World"" and ""Nude Descending a Staircase"" ?This wonderfully imagined but definitely peculiar item has a different cover on each side (see photos) and a very useful booklet including copies of the relevant art plus helpful explanatory text.Personally, I liked the Schickele/Thurber stuff better than the other, but it was a painless way to learn a lot more about art. If your learning style is ""audio"" as much as video, you might enjoy this too!"
4,A wonderful text,"This isn't actually a work all its own but a selection of quotes from various Church Fathers and a few others, and especially St. Theophan the Recluse, on the Jesus Prayer and on related topics of Orthodox spirituality. The selections are, of course, fantastic. The book is filled from cover to cover with practical advice from our holy fathers and mothers on how to pursue a more intimate relationship with our Lord, God, and Savior Jesus Christ. I recommend it very much to those interested in either trying to understand Orthodox spirituality or who would themselves like to deepen their spiritual life."
5,An incredible intimation on Christian meditation,"This book is a ""one of a kind"" Christian meditation manual, with notes and quotations, checked by personal experiences, and with honest comments on Christian belief and right and wrong sides of it. The person who wrote it was a monk, so there is no ""learned"" jibberish -- but only the real gold."
5,Learn about the Art of Prayer as you read this book,"If you want answers to the questions? WHAT IS PRAYER? WHAT IS ITS ESSENCE? HOW CAN WE LEARN TO PRAY? WHAT DOES THE SPIRIT OF THE CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE AS HE PRAYS IN HUMILITY OF HEART? pg. 51. Then read this book. I even bought a copy and gave it to a Pentacostal friend of mine, for his birthday. This book is unquestionably destined to become equal to the Philikolia."
4,Peter Wake moves to steam power,"Although I did not find this book to be as good as the first two in the series, it still was a great read and the information about the early use of steam power in the Union Navy was fascinating. The only reason I limited it to four stars was that the first two were so very good. I do not hesitate recommending it to anyone that enjoyed the first two books of the series"
3,Fluke 199C,I like everything about this item except for the batteries. They don't last very long and can't be changed without voiding the calibration. I used a Tektronix unit in graduate school that had easily replaceable batteries that used an external charger. I think that system might have been a better idea. I have spoken with Fluke technical support to determine the most effective way to charge this item: one representative said that I can leave it plugged in all the time and it will be fine. Another representative said I should put it on a timer so it would only charge occasionally when I wasn't using it. I'm frustrated with $200 battery changes every year. Other than that I like it.
5,Mr Ruby... are you serious?,"""a comically pretentious, futuristic rock opera written by a nerdy drummer and sung by a whiny-voiced geek.""??? Two musicians who have also stood the test of time and are still rocking out to this day. Few have achieved that. Do you get paid to write this garbage Michael?-Angry Die Hard Rush chick"
5,RUSH AT THEIR BEST,RUSH were amongst my favorite Canadian groups along with TRIUMPH and 2112 is one of their best albums after FLY BY NIGHT and their epic debut album.This contains anthems like SOMETHING FOR NOTHING and THE TEMPLES OF SYRINX.very highly recommended.get all three albums.Thanks.
5,Just a great classic concept album,"I don't know what I could say about this album that hasn't already been said, but I believe that this is Rush's first really great album, they hit a stride after this album came out, the next 5 albums release we're equally as good.1. '2112': (10/10) Just a perfect song, it's 20 minutes long and it is just utterly amazing and possibly one of their best songs.2. A Passage To Bangkok (9/10)3. The Twilight Zone (7/10)4. Lessons (9/10)5. Tears (8/10)6. Something For Nothing (10/10) Just a great finish to this album."
4,STRONG.,"The ineresing thing here is the fact that this album is heavy, extremely heavy, even being labeled as a progressive-rock album. It's progressive in its conception, but the guys plays with energy, even in the soft moments like LESSONS.I just love this album, I'm not a rush total fan, but I own a lot of their albums, and give credit to where credit is due: these guys are genius.I recently watched them live in So Paulo, Brazil (November 22, 2002), in front of 65,000 people (never befor they had played to such a huge crowd. Fortunately, I was right at the front of the stage (after paying a HUGE amount of money to do so...)and I could enjoy all their marvellous technique at close hand."
4,A mighty piece of prog-rock.,"2112, the title track, is superb - the screaming ""Temples of Syrinx"", the lilting ""Soliloquy""...the rest of the songs are fairly average, although ""Something For Nothing"" has cool guitar and a catchy chorus. Definitely an album worth repeat listens."
3,Who's buying this?,"I mean, if you're a Rush fan, you already have this album. If you're not, then you should start somewhere else first. The first ""song"", ""2112"", is a concept song that took the entire first side of the album ('member those?). The rest is kind of mediocre, but I like ""Bangkok"". If you like this ""concept"" sci-fi style, then you might want to start with Hemispheres instead of this CD, or even Farewell To Kings (while not a concept album, it has a reminiscent, partly acoustic style.) If you like a harder rock sound, try Moving Pictures (probably their best) or Permanent Waves. Return to this one only when you know what you want, or have to fill in the Rush library."
1,will not play on sony blu ray,"Great package soon to be a dissapointed boy, sat down with a beer and the comic book pressed play on the sony blu ray remote and nothing player froze had to removepower to get the disc out. Checked for fimware updates none pending.Anybody else with this problem, should go get the turn table out?"
5,The passion and the fury...,"The importance of this album cannot be understated. If it hadn't sold as it did - the band would have broken up and Rush would have wound up some obscure footnote in the history of Canadian rock. Fortunately, a creative breakthrough was also a commercial success and ""2112"" stands out as the 'second' best studio album Rush ever recorded. If you can tolerate Ayn Rand, heavy metal, and prog rock you'll discover a gem of an album. An extremely passionate (and at times pretensious) album."
4,the year is 2112,"we still listen to the 20th century band rush"" even now females cant understand the music. it appeals only to males. the trilogy albums farewell to kings, 2112 and hemisperes continue to be the epitome of rock/progressive music. it remains the core curriculum at most music schools. chops abound,taurus peddles, double bassdrum, layered chord guitar technique are rampant. all with grace. listen and learn. lasting over a hundred years these recordings will be with us forever. thank god and ayn rand. power from air, permanent waves"". who is john gault?"
2,cheers to the fan from oregon!,"i COMPLETELY identify with everything you've said, having gone through all the same general transitions of perspective. this is one of the early rush records that got me going, and that is pretty much the only value that it still represents for me. alot of the other rush releases i still take somewhat ""seriously"" (whatever that means), like permanent waves, moving pics, grace under pressure, hold your fire, but this one is outstandingly SILLY!!! It gets 2 stars only on reflection of these other great albums; there's definitely still a... fun... element with this album."
2,Unintentionally hilarious,"Ah, ""2112""--the rock-and-roll album that defines ""teen pretentiousness."" This silly trifle masquerading as philosophy is something that one buys at age 15, thinks is ""way cool,"" listens to a million times after doing 2112 bong hits, then realizes a few years later that it's about as intellectual as a cookbook. This is what happens when a few teenagers (i.e. Rush) stumble upon a philosophy textbook or the doggrel of lousy writer and thinker (Rand), and says, ""Cool! Let's write a concept album!"" A little knowledge is a dangerous thing indeed. The boys are all excellent musicians, we know that, and sometimes the music really soars. But come on. The lyrics are just laughable. And Ayn Rand? I didn't think anybody took her seriously anymore, not that anyone took her seriously in the first place."
2,alvin and the...,"Though I can't deny the talent of these guys,it's not my cup of tea.They really should have found someone other than Geddy to sing or simply not had any vocals at all.I can't get past the Alvin and the Chipmunks tonality and pitch of the vocal tracks.Very white bread and soulless,but technically proficient music."
5,"Great band, great album... Slick dick is a moron!","This is by far one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. If you are going by what Slick dick says, look at his review. Comparing Rush to Slayer, Megadeth, and Metallica? He must not know that Rush put out their first CD in 1969 when the guys from those bands were nothing more than dreamers. And calling Rush ""new wave""... wow. I'm speechless. Ask any music entusiast who has listened to Rush and I can almost guarantee that they will say this stands as their best album. It is a great buy and every minute of the rock they sing is priceless."
5,More than a rock opera,"2112 is without a doubt one of RUSH's best. I first heard RUSH when I was a freshman in high school (Grace Under Preasure) and have been hooked every since. The first side (I too remember albums) of 2112 is AMAZING, but the second side (or half for you youngins') is equally AMAZING. Whenever I listen to 2112 (or anything by these guys) I think to myself WOW, this is only 3 guys. Alex, Neil and Geddy are without equal. Their music is tight, complex and a pleasure to listen too. I doubt you'll ever hear a simple 4/4 beat in anything they do. I just can't say enough good about these guys, hands down the greates power trio, ever. (TRIUMPH is another good power trio out of Canada if you like RUSH you'll like TRIUMPH). One last word of caution to anyone thinking about buying a RUSH CD for the first time, they have a lot of (GREAT) stuff, so you'll end up spending a lot of money (but, you will NOT regret it for a second)"
5,Unparalleled...,"RUSH put out many good / great albums during the 70s. 2112 is my personal favorite, due to it's futuristic, sci-fi adventure storyline. From beginning to end, this is RUSH at the top of their intelligent, hard-rocking game. Basically a concept album, 2112 is meant to be listened to in it's entirety. For me, it never gets old..."
3,A rare and precious metal beneath a ton of rock,"Rush was one of the few bands of its time to popularize the concept song and concept album. This particular one is by a longshot their most successful attempt at concept music. Taking place in the year 2112, it talks about how a man brings back the elder race of humanity by learning how to play a guitar (this is grossly paraphrased, but I don't have the patience for a whole synopsis). The music involved is some of the most memorable music Rush has made, even that low-tech sci-fi sound in the beginning is instantly recognized as Rush. 2112 is a classic, for Rush and the entire rock world.So why only 3 stars? The rest of the album. The b-side songs on this album are poorly made, anticlimax, and so completely unmemorable, the listener probably still thinks the album's only 20 minutes long. However, the epic title track makes this whole album worth its purchase."
3,A good album.,"2112 is an album from Rush that I've always had respect for. They really do some interesting things on here. ""2112"" is a really good song that I still like to hear sometimes. You can tell that a lot of work was put into it. I also happen to really like ""Tears."" That's a really impressive ballad with good musicianship and vocals. The rest of the songs on 2112 are okay. Worth a listen."
5,Awesome Title Track!,A wonderful blending of music and sci-fi places the title track among the best conceptual pieces ever written. A 20+ minute seven part song/story that excites the imagination and even flexes the intellect. Rush's finest achievement and a welcome addition to rock history.
5,"Without a doubt, one of the greatest rock albums of all-time","I don't care what anybody says, 2112 is Rush's best album ever. The song, 2112, is very inspiring. Whenever I listen to that song, sometimes I feel like I'm in that song. It's one of the greatest , uh, what would you call it, ""rock operas"" ever. There ought to be a movie made after it. There is not one thing that I do not like about this album. Something For Nothing and A Passage To Bangkok also rock. If you are a true Rush fan like me, you must own this album. You will be amazed!!!"
5,2112 rules!!!,"This deep and moving album is a highlight in Rush's career,from the explosive guitar riffs to the thundering rhythms!Totally awesome!"
4,The heaviest Rush cd,"The first part of this is a concept album the 2112 Epic. My favorite part of 2112 Epic is the opening instumental and the temple of syrinx. Outside of wrking man it is Rush's heaviest song. The vocal are a little rough at times, but it is a good song. The second side is just straight foward rock with the exception of Tears. My favorite's of this side are A passage to bagkok and something for nothing."
5,A Great and Heavy Rush...,"The title track of 2112 is by far the heaviest and most complex composition Rush ever recorded. Peart's lyrics and drums are amazing on this song, along with Lifeson's best guitar work ever and Lee's rythmic bass and voicals. They prooved that they had staying power and were more then a Zeppelin copy. The growth in their music started with the album ""Fly By Night"", with the addision of Peart on drums and his writing, the band started to make their traid mark "" thinking mans rock"". But in this their 4th LP, it came together. The whole album is great!! Something For Nothing is my favorite Rush song. They have changed their sound a couple of times over the years, but to me they have yet to produce a better album then 2112."
5,a truely and powerful masterpiece,rush;s classic 1976 album 2112 is averry incredible well made album.first you got the 20 minute 7 part7 titlted epic that will blow youaway witch takes up the first halfof the album then you got 5 more great songs such as a passage to bankok and something for nothing.i got this on compact disc andit sounds great great job by geddylee.alex liefson and neail peart.any of you rush fans that dont have this one ya gotta go out andget it.
5,Masterpiece,"2112 is a masterpiece for the beggining to the end of the CD, 2112 is one of the best writen songs of all time, the others songs are really great. If you want to start to know Rush, I recommend this cd and Moving Pictures"
5,Power-rock space opera...,"Mix:1) Three supremely talented musicians.2) Sci-Fi inspired, over-the-top lyrics.3) Hard-driving guitar-and-drum heavy rhythms.Take away all limits on creativity, such as time limits for songs (2112 is more than 20 minutes long), and you get a unique record. You won't hear this much on the radio, but it's great at a concert and its great on your CD player. Really great stuff."
4,2112 is worth getting for the title track alone...,"Rush's 2112 album has what I call the Saving Private Ryan syndrome - the first section is so great that the rest seems like a letdown in comparison. I'm a die-hard Rush fan and ""2112"" is my favorite rock track of all time. The energy, the brilliance of the music, and the story in the lyrics all serve to create a transcendent listening experience. The rest of the album is excellent as well, but the songs can't compare with ""2112"". ""Lessons"" and ""Something For Nothing"" rock pretty hard. A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, and Permanent Waves are more consistent albums, but you won't be disappointed buying anything Rush released from 1975 to 1981 - the material they put out in that 6 year period was practically flawless."
2,"Comically pretentious, futuristic rock opera","Comically pretentious, futuristic rock opera... yes it is. Spot on review. And yes, the drummer is nerdy. Neil sure does try hard, but the beats are so unfunky. How many rappers have ever sampled Neil Peart? Geddy Lee is so ridiculous, you have to smile.It is part of rock history, and it has it's place. You have to laugh at it thou, it's goofy, I can't imagine trying to listen to the whole album. The first couple parts of 2112 hit that junior high rock vibe, it's Rush, a guilty pleasure like candy that makes your teeth ache."
1,This CD is horrible!,"I love guitar music, but I couldn't get past the whiny vocals. They are horrible. I would like to know who taught the lead singer how to sing. He is pathetic."
4,"Solid graphics card, no lag, and good for average gamers","While I've only been using the card for a few days now, I can say that this is a solid design and has the ability to handle all average and high end games (many at high res, all at standard). I'm not a heavy gamer, so there are bound to be more detailed reviews than mine, but I do casual gaming and this card is more than expected. I also run dual monitors, and while the setup took slightly longer than expected, all is good.My only caution, and I'm not sure if this due to Amazon, the wholesaler, or the manufacturer, is that the card did not come in it's original packaging. The box was original, but the packaging inside had been changed, as if it was a refurb. I looked it over, tested it, and have it running now with no problems, so I don't think it is a refrub, but the inside packaging was suspicious. None the less, included all accessories (cables, manual, disk, etc) so all good in the end.A good price and a great medium gaming card."
5,Nice card for the price.,This card is affordable yet offers exceptional performance for the price. Running this card in SLI mode offers comparable performance to cards in the 8800 series. It is the ideal card for users who want to take advantage of dx10. The Windows Experience index repots this card scores a 5.9 for graphics and a 5.7 for gaming graphics. This card is quiet and cool and will not break the bank.
3,"Nice game, nice storyline, bad technical aspects","Like I said the game is awesome, and the storyline is pretty deep. But, the tech aspects are seriously flawed. The controls are a huge problem. I feel that the analog stick is a crucial part to a big portion of the control scheme. The keyboard just doesn't cut it. Then, of course you have your screwed up camera angles. They were fine up until Stage 7 of Sonic's adventure. They keep going all sorts of funky ways so when you jump you jump the direction away from the camera's new direction instead of the intended direction, so I have lost many times to that serious glitch. So, when you go to play this game keep in mind that you WILL lose many times due to control problems and weird glitches like falling through a guardrail. Good Game Sega, but not for the PC."
4,Sonic Adventure + PC = Fun,"Ok. Evreyone Says That It's A Port From Sonic Adventure. Well It's Not. It's A Remake Of It. All in all, it's a great game.Graphics: 9.9Sound 9.9 ---- All Out Of 10Gameplay: 5.0"
3,well...,"Well, I beat it in one day, the graphics rock but when they speak their mouths go haywire. so i give it a three"
5,The Doll Who Knew the Future aka The Oracle Doll,"This is a chapter book that I used to read to fifth grade classes. Theyloved it and repeatedly asked if I would read it again before the end of theterm. I recall a girl who once came to school when she was too ill to bethere because she didn't want to miss the chapter that day!Actually, I just purchased a couple of copies for my very young grandchildrenso that (just in case it's unavailable at some point) they can read and share it with their friends in a few years."
5,This bothered me a bit,"On the front of the book, it says something to the effect of, "" Can Rose, Lucy, and Peter control Gabriella? Can anyone?"" Well, I have to say that there is no Peterin this book. Please have to author check this. He/she might want to have it changed. Thank you for your convenience.Sammie"
3,Aircast Short Walker,Good for keeping foot and ankle immobile; walking was easier than I thought it would be. Easy to take apart and clean. Velcro closures kept loosening; clumsy for going up and down stairs; hot for summer use.
1,Strictly for the credulous.,Earth to cultists: Hoyle's steady-state theory was discredited forty years ago. Give it up already.
5,A must have,"This book is a must have if you are serious about buying, selling, or restoring a GTO. The information it contains can save you alot of time, money, and aggervation."
3,Could've been better...,"These are nice, I mean yeah its great not having cords in the way. And the dpad and build of the controller is the same ruggedness you'd expect from Madcatz. I just have one problem... WHY did they put Start and Select all the way on the TOP of the controller? It makes it very hard to reach these two very important buttons. I can deal with the Analog switch being on the bottom, but jeeze. Why couldn't they have just put them on the face of the controller? Oh right, cuz it'd get in the way of the sports decals... right. Oh well, could be worse... atleast they aren't thin flat invisible buttons like the last controller I bought from Madcatz, lol... It also would've been smarter to make it use AA's instead of AAA's. AA's are more common."
4,A great 'live' release.,"I have loved this disc ever since I first heard it in the late 80's. My enthusiasm was only slightly dimmed when I recently learned about the studio overdubs. What a bummer. Hence my lowered rating. Otherwise I'm tempted to say this is the best live album I've ever heard. ""Xanadu"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"" contain some of my favorite drum work of all time-these are amazing versions of these songs. ""Broon's Bane"" is stunningly gorgeous, Alex plays with fluidity and grace. You get plenty of Rush's greatest songs here. In fact, this set can substitute for a 'greatest hits' package if you want (Tom Sawyer, La Villa, Closer To The Heart, Freewill, YYZ, etc..) Great stuff even with a few overdubs. Rush at their best.Highly recommended."
3,Bass-heavy and dull mix lets down interesting material,"I agree 100% with others here who comment that the mix on this album is truly dreadful. The bass overwhelms everything else and the overall sound is compressed (""loud"") and muddy. I imagine these problems are far less noticeable if you are using tiny speakers or earbuds, but on a good old-fashioned stereo system with decent electronics and speakers the effect is quite unpleasant. You can make this a lot more listenable if you you have an equalizer that lets you roll the bass off and boost the treble, but the compression is still an issue.It's a real shame that the sound quality is so poor, because these are interesting versions of the songs, with noticeable extra energy."
5,"Brings back memories, excellent remastering","This was a favorite album of mine back in high school, and listening to it now brings back *so* many memories. For the Rush fan this is an exciting and essential album for your collection. The listener is catching Rush right around the time of the Moving Pictures tour, and a time when they were still very much in their prime. The entire disc is outstanding, but favs of mine are 'Xanadu', 'The Trees', 'YYZ', and 'La Villa Strangiato' (which at the time of the recording was the essential closer for Rush concerts). Brilliant performances, great recording, and excellent remastering. 5 stars."
2,Great Songs and Musicianship....very poor recording quality,"I have to be the odd Rush fan out on this disc. I have listened to this record for years and just cannot warm up to it. I agree with the fine musicianship and a good selection of songs from 70's and early 80's, however only one other reviewer recognized the totally overpowering bass. This record is muddy, bassy, and overall not a great quality recording. I am surprised Rush being as quality conscious as they are every allowed this to be released. This was released at the peak of Rush's popularity and nobody seemed to care that the original LP and now the disc is from a poor master recording. Most of the reviews focus on the song selection, and on nothing else. I am surprised this has stood the test of time with CD technology. If this is how Rush really sounded live in 1980, I am glad I didn't see them until a few years later. I have seen Rush 7 times live, they always played this well or better, but never sounded this bad."
5,Captured Live,This CD captures the band live at what many consider their peak. This CD sounds like they bottled the band. It has the live energy and all the musical chops you expect from this trio. One of my favorite Rush albums.
5,One Of The Best Live Albums,"RUSH, EXIT STAGE LEFT is a excellent well done live album. The setlist is good but the sound of the record is excellent. My favorite tracks on the album are ""THE SPIRIT OF THE RADIO"", ""YYZ"" , ""CLOSER TOT HE HEART"", ""FREEWILL, and ""La Villa Strangiato"". This album is great because of Geddy Lee's Bass and Vocals, Alex Lifeson's Guitar playing and last but not least Neil Peart's Drumming. EXIT STAGE LEFT is a great live album."
3,Great Songs But......,"The song list here is perfect! The Spirit Of Radio! Freewill!Tom Sawyer! The Trees! Xanadu! Closer To The Heart! As a matter of fact, this is a better greatest hits compilation then Chronicles! The sad part is, this live album has no live feel. The album opens with The Spirt Of Radio. The musician ship is good, but the song is lifeless. Same with most of the songs on this ""live"" release. All the songs for the most part sounds the same as their studio counterparts. I heard this recording before I went to a Rush concert. I did not want to go. After hearing this recording I thought seeing Rush in concert would be a boring experiment (thankfully I did go see them and I was proven wrong). If you want a live Rush CD skip this. Many of the songs here are on 1998's Different Stages and they are alive and well. This is for die hard Rush fans only."
4,Finally justice is served,"Mercury/Polygram should apologize wholeheartedly to all the fans for ever daring to release this without ""A Passage To Bangkok"" which is the standout track on this live set. Lifeson's guitarcraft is evident on the swirling riffs of this song, and his acoustic skills on show on the plaintive intro ""Broon's Bane"" which rolls into ""The Trees."" Other standouts : ""Xanadu"", which injects a proper sense of wonder to what is a visual experience live, and ""Jacob's Ladder"" which is strangely haunting on this set."
4,Very good live album from the early days,"I would say that I like about 80% of this cd. There is only two tracks out of thirteen that I don't like, but it is just a matter of taste.This cd capture Rush in great shape performing some great classics.This album has it all, powerful rock, ballads, great solos...Good job Geddy, Alex and Neil !"
5,its great,Exit Stage Left is the best albem of Rush.I love the song xanadu because it is a long song.My favorite song on Exit Stage Left is YYZ.
4,Rush at their peak.,"I don't even usually like live albums, but 'Exit Stage Left' is exceptional. This LP presents Rush at their creative and commercial peak, and faithfully reproduces their live concert sound while demonstrating their virtuoso musical chops. It also serves as a 'best-of' for their early to mid periods (1974-1981). A great headphone album, and a great concert document."
5,Great Live Performances From the Best Group Ever,"This is NO DOUBT,the best Rush cd ever.They are the greatest live band ever in my opinion.This is a must buy CD.I think this is the 4th or 5th copy I have had.All the others were worn out because of constant playing."
3,Essential for fans only,"Who needs a Rush live-album except their fans? There are no surprises in this ""Best of late-'70s/early '80s"" compilation, and with the depth of experience these three guys have, you really could expect a more electrifying performance. It's the same problem with any other successful rock band: They have to satisfy a large fanbase, and this doesn't allow them to bring some new wrinkles into their songs or even to experiment. Rush are a technically proficient band, but much of their live performances remind me of boring ""Dire Straits"" live stuff with all its perfectionism and predictability. For me, ""All the World's a Stage"" is a far more interesting and energetic live album. ""Exit..Stage left"" is well made, though."
2,not really my kind of music,"i bought this Rush album, not knowing what any of their music sounds like. I don't really like 80's music, so this cd wasn't my favorite. I am not really bashing this cd, it's just not my kind of music. I'm sure if you like this kind of music, it is the Sgt. Peppers of this genre. So if you've never heard this music before, give it a listen, and then if you like it, go ahead and buy it."
3,"A ""Fast Forward"" Button Video","The story is silly and d-r-a-g-s on much too long with a lot of melodramatic corn. For Rockabilly fans this one is worth watching to see Bob Luman perform. Note a very young, pre-Elvis James Burton playing hot licks in Bob's band."
2,Yawn.,"Christy, owner of a seedy nightclub, loves Natalie. But Natalie loves a clean-cut gambler, and Christy is going a bit mad because of it. Yawn. Well, this is a forgettable film. If you're going to see it at all, see the Exploitica version."
2,3 pack deal congoleum,"Hi I just bought the 3 pack for $66.32, now it is on sale? for $50.98? What happened? The unit prices are the same, did i miss something? OR is this the typical buy high and then it goes on sale murphys law? I wonder if AMAZON.com can help or explain?"
5,WoodWick Candles,"I bought a woodwick candle last weekend at an Antique shop, I love the candle it burns very slow I have been burning mine about 2 to 3 hours every night and it is still at the same level as the day I bought it. The smell is wonderful and it is so relaxing listening to the crackle from the wick just like sitting next to a fire. If you love to burn candles this is for sure one that you will want to try!"
1,Rickety construction,"If you're used to the sturdy equipment available at most half-way decent gyms, you'll be sorely disappointed with anything from this line of products. Though it's relatively affordable, its wobbly, rickety construction makes you worry more about the stability of the equipment rather than concentrate on your own workout. You get what you pay for, I guess."
3,HAIL TO THE QUEEN,"I love this woman and what she has done for hip-hop music. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the songs. most were up tempo and sampled, but alot of them sound the same. Don't get me wrong, she can sing, unlike those pretending (j.lo) but I think that it could have been a better album maybe if the neptunes could have given her a fresh new sound. she's still the queen, but maybe if her voice wasn't strained on alot of the tracks it could have been a better album."
4,A Failed Attempt of My Life Part II,"This was a decent album but in no way could there ever be another My Life let alone Puffy is wack nowadays. This was a good album standout tracks ""Love @First Sight"", ""Willing &Waiting"", ""It's a Wrap"",and ""Feel Like Making Love"". It didn't sell as good as some of her previous works but the Mary fans shouldn't be disappointed, but ""The Breakthrough"" is another classic under Mary's belt."
2,DISAPPOINTED,Here I was all hyped for the reunion of Mary and Diddy only to be disappointed and almost angry for such a lackadaisical effort. I know they could have done better than this! Is this the same producer that produced MY LIFE? This album is full of half baked hip hop tracks and amaturish hooks that sound like some child wrote them. Mary's incessant moaning and groaning in an out of key gets utterly annoying. I wonder if she was just trying to over compensate for some of the weak tracks she had to sing over. She's constantly wrestling with her songs and beating them up. MEMO TO MARY: SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE. I wonder what it would be like to have Mary team up with a more traditional R&B producer to help steer her in a better direction? I don't believe she has tapped into her full potential yet.
2,Pretty Good when Compared to Her past few but still missing,I'd give this Album a 2.5 overall.Production by Puffy&Crew is a welcome for Mary but overall this Album has time warp written all over it.much like Michael Jackson's Invinvible alot of the material here feels like it was Canned Side tracks from 1992 that just didn't make the cut then.alot has changed&I use to like MJB more then but now give me that Ultimate Greatest Hits Set&I'm Cool.Her Formula of Making music has worn out it's Welcome for me&my ears overall.this Album is easily better than Her past few but still missing something that says something for me.this Album feels like a Attempt at trying to Re-Capture Her Street Cred&that should never come into Question because MJB has never really Crossed over to begin with despite having Success&being in the game over a Decade.running back to Puffy was a Cool Idea but I think at least 5-6 years too late now.most of the tracks here are decent to Good but nothing really knocks me out.
3,Not too good,"On Mary's newest album LOVE AND LIFE, she teamed up with Sean Combs who helped make her first two albums a success. Obviously, the public is not responding well to this reconciliation, because the album is not doing too well. The album has already had three singles and has not even been out yet for 6 months. The latest single, ""Not Today"", featuring Eve, is so far the most successful. ""Love At First Sight"" and ""Oooh"" flopped big time. The music on the album is not bad, but overproduced. Some of the sampling works in favor of the songs, but other times it just works against it. I hope Mary finds herself on her next album, because this and NO MORE DRAMA were very weak compared to albums like MARY, MY LIFE or SHARE MY WORLD. Highlights from this include ""When We"", ""Oooh"", ""Friends"", ""Willing and Waiting"", and a few others, but there's too many songs here that sound the same, and ultimately it's a pretty forgettable album."
5,One of her Best,"I think this album is one of Mary's best. She took us on a ride of her life again with this cd. She is on a different level now. It's a real feel good album. She has a song on it for everyone....in my opinion. Some of the highlights are ""Don't Go"", ""not today"", ""ultimate relationship"", ""ooh"", ""friends"", ""it's a w rap."".....just about the whole cd. Go Mary!!"
4,good cd,"i have all marys cds and i like all of them except no more drama i did not like at all. it was quickly retired to the rack. but this cd is good. i really like it alot of good songs songs i can feel with lyrics i can feel and relate to. i recommend this, to me this is the mary i enjoy you can really tell she is at a happy place in her life it really shows. good cd, nice positive vibe to it."
3,I Love the Cover... she looks great,"This album is cool, but recently I read a Mary's interview sayin that she wasn't faithfull to her fans with this album, that P.Diddy didn't let her do her thing.I only like her fourth single from this album, ""It's A Wrap"". It's this album's Jewel!!!"
2,Come on Mary,I was disappointed. Mary J Blige is already a soul legend and the songs on this album did not do her justice at all. She was off-key much of the time and the songs rambled on about nothing of substance. She can do better than this.
1,RETIREMENT TIME FOR MARY!,"This album sucked! If she can't come out with something better than My Life then she should retire. ""What's the 411"" and ""My Life"" is more of a Mary J. Blige album."
1,This woman sounds like she swallowed a rooster,"She's very very overrated and I can't understand why. She has a horrible, very weak voice.The first single for this album ""Love @ 1st Sight"" is very, very bad."
1,dance for me and I smack you in your face girl,This girl can't sing nor dance to save her life. She just screams and looks ugly and old. Anyone who thinks she can sing is an moran. Please make this horrible old woman go away. I do not like this woman at all. The songs are not good and are very dull and with very very bad lyrics.
5,Return Of The Queen,"THis is a hot jam. The best she's put out yet. I can relate to it when i'm sad, mad, or happy. And because of this album, i've put the drama behind me too.THis is not just another Mary J Blige album. THis is THE album. The best, nothing but the best coming from the Queen from Yonkers. Trust me on this, you will not be disappointed. I know i wasn't."
5,A GOOD CD,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ALBUM I FEEL THAT MARY AND DIDDY DID A GOOD JOB ON THIS ONE I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ALL OF THE MARY J. BLIGE FANS OUT THERE AND I ALSO RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ALL THE HATERS!
1,"i,m a mary j blige fan but?",I'M NOT FEELIN THIS CD AT ALL SO FAR THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECT THERE IS NOT ONE SONG ON THIS ALBUM THAT I CAN SAY I LIKE.MAYBE IT WILL GROW ON ME. I'VE WAITED ALL THIS TIME AND I'M VERY DISSAPOINTED.
5,A HOT ALBUM,"I love this album, because it has more hip hop than the last album. I love the song she sings with 50 cent. I hope that's her next hit. But I loved Love @ First Sight with Method Man They make a great pair. I hope she stays with this style of music. I recommend this to anyone whose a mary j fan."
2,Overrated as a Singer,"I like MJB for her vibe and her first two albums were something I could relate to. ""Love & Life"" tries to re-capture the past with the renewal of MJB and P.Diddy's musical partnership. It falls more than short. It also is a good example of what I have been hearing from MJB for years- oversinging and on many occasions downright hollaring."
3,Mary's album,"The album is a good and bad, some songs are really good and some songs just say in your mind, uhh skip!!"
3,Not a must have!,"After listening to this entire cd on America Online I decided to save my money. This cd is not a must have and does not live up to the the reputation of her two previous albums which I believe are better. I believe that this current release is the kind that you might get to like after a few or many listens. After all is said and done, this cd does not dissapoint. This album is infact better than Ashante's latest release which I almost trashed but gave to a friend."
4,BOTH Audiences are satisfied!,"Blige is that rarity: an artist that transcends generations. The young embrace her as ""the queen of hip-hop soul"" and ""old school"" fans appreciate her honest, straightforward, and gritty approach to R & B.""Love & Life"" appeals to both, and as a member of the latter, I can only say, skip three of the first seven cuts, the ones that feature guest performances from Eve, Method Man, and 50 Cent. Those may be ""flavas of the month"" for the ""Next Generation"", but they do nothing for me.It's not until Blige breaks into the title cut that the more mature listener receives something worthy of its attention. From that cut on, the singer reveals a persona of a woman coming of age and acceptance of who she really is.While not a five-star album like 2001's ""No More Drama"" or the self-titled ""Mary"" from 1999, ""Love & Life"" still towers over most other releases by Blige's contemporaries or predecessors.And those that have followed Blige can only stand in the artist's dust."
4,Tight Work...,"Once again, MJB has managed to kill two birds with one stone: she's shown us her progression as a person in her lyrics and she's managed to make some nice songs, too. Although this is a good album, I am disappointed in the production. Musically, there is too much ad libbing and not enough ""music time"" (where there's just music, no singing). That tends to overdo a song. Also, there is too much of a P Diddy feel on the album. One thing that made No More Drama so good was that it was new and different. There were various producers and writers to give it much flavor. On this release, although the songs are good, you are taken back rythmatically to the early days. While it shows nice to reminisce (check spelling), it give the feel of ""nothing new"". I feel, had Mary worked with various producers instead of just Diddy, the album would have been richer and more vibrant, IE ""NMD""."
4,The Queen of Hip Hop & R&B is Back With Full Force!!,"Wassup. This is Mary J. Blige's 6th cd and I am here to tell you, she still has what it takes to stay in the game. This cd turned out to be a lot better than what I thought it was going to be. I didn't think that it would be that great since Puffy helped her produce it, but it came out pretty good. I just think that Puffy took away from the Mary J. Blige we all have come to know. I think that he put too much of what he is like in his music on her cd. That is why I only gave it a rating of 4 stars. I still think that that album was excellent on her part though. Especially when it comes to her lyrics and to hear how much her voice has matured since her last album. If you want to hear a great album, go and get this cd. Mary J. Blige is and always will be the Queen of Hip Hop & R&B."
2,The Queen of Hip Hop Soul - No More!,"When I first heard that Mary and P. Diddy were getting back together, I thought this album would go down as a CLASSIC! I am glad that I am one who can admit to a mistake. This album is far from a classic, it is at the bottom of the list of all of Mary's studio albums. The sad part about it, is that Puffy tries to use the same formula that made What's the 411? and My Life such works of art. This album lacks the passion that a Mary joint needs to be successful. It appears that every song on the album is a testimony to Mary's current happiness and inner peace, a message that you don't need 15 songs and 3 interludes to get across."
2,Not the same Mary,"Mary J Blidge is in my opinion the best female vocalist of our time. Unfortunately, I can not say the same for this album. Mary has changed her life around and is now at peace with herself, hence, a 'new type of album' - but I must admit I enjoyed Mary more when she was singing full of pain. Hopefully Mary will be able to belt out some happy ballads on her next album. -- Stick with the old school -- this album I will not be listening to very much."
2,Stuck in the air with nothing,"Ok, so I bought this cd and did not open it until I was on a 13 hour flight to Korea. I figured that the cd would be bumping and make the flight seem like 3 hours. WRONG!!! I wanted to jump out of the plane. I LOVE Mary and have been very patient with her through these last couple of so-so cds. But I am through. You just can't have a sister stuck on a plane with nothing to listen to!!! The last song is great, so I replayed that for about 2 hours. Mary is going backwards in a boring kind of way. Maybe the next cd will go all the way backwards to ""My Life"" or ""What's the 411."""
5,Don't Compare Mary to Mary. Compare her to her peers!,"People have written a lot of inconsistant reviews about Mary on here. Rating her a 3 out of 5, because you are comparing her with her past.You'd rather hear pain, than happy times, so you rate her as average. Well, we all grow and change (I hope). Why should Mary J. be penalized for growing. This album is still hot. Her music is still Grit, to the essence and element of the word. Her Pic should be right next to the word in Websters! Anyway, compare Mary to her peers. Compare her to the other albums out right now. You may be used to the saddness in her voice and love the way it comforts you. But happiness, in a once depressed soul, is much better than despair. Feel me!! Mary is real, so she gonna sing like she feels. Undeniable though, is the fact that Mary always brings us top form music. Reliaze that, and you will enjoy this spirtual soul singer and her ride to the top, that much more. Orlando -(Mary's most devoted fan!)"
2,Mary could have done better!,This is definitely not Mary's best. I love Mary and I was totally disappointed in this CD. It seems like when Mary is in pain her music is better. Mary please try again.
3,"Not cool Mary, Not Cool","This album is really wack. There are too many samples and the lyrics are happy but get corny after a while. ""Don't Go"" was okay. Willing and waiting was good, Friends is good, Love @ 1st sight was really good, Makin love has a good opening riff, Special part of me was touching and Press on was good the rest of the album was terrible."
3,I LOVE MARY BUT I HATE HER NEW SOUND,"Mary is a wonderful artist, the tracks are blazin but she hits this terrible high note in almost every song and it sounds horrible. One of my friends wrote Beautiful One from the Mary album and he said she was a wonderful vocalist but sometimes what sounds good to her doesnt sound good to everyone else. I will continue to support Mary but someone needs to let her know about her singing. Geez."
2,Bought it Cheap and Now I Know Why,"I've never written a review before but after buying MJ's ""Love & Life"" used (including cracked jewel case looking as if it were run over) I felt the need to inform prospective buyers. First I'm a big fan and constantly play the ""Dance for Me"" CD loving the powerful lyrics and terrific vocal range of this extremely talented artist. However, when I played ""Love & Life"" in the car for the first time, I found myself hitting the forward track button, trying to select a song that showcased the talent I had come to know. NO such luck - in fact the CD seemed endless with 18 tracks. Now I know why the prior buyer cracked the case."
2,come one MARY!,"Mary hasn't brought her A-game to the table for quite a long time. No More Drama was supposed to be just that-- the end of drama in Mary's life (personally and professionally) but obviously from the vibe of this CD and other things in her releases previously, NMD must have meant no more drama for 2001. With this CD, there is a little more promise but she's lost the ""thing"" that made Mary J Blige. In reality she hasn't been all about that ""thing"" since MARY, maybe even back as far as SHARE MY WORLD. She's just got to do better... she's MARY J BLIGE"
3,SOLID ALBUM,"THE ALBUM IS LIKE A ROLLERCOASTER IT TAKES UPS ANDDOWNS,BUT ALL IN TEH ALBUM ISA SOLID EFFORT,PUFFY PLAYED MARYTHIS TIME AROUND I GUESS KARMA ISA REAL B*TCH!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR HER NEXT ALBUM."
3,Mary's All Time Low,"Mary, Mary, why you buggin' ma? Love At First Site is the old school feel that led me to purchase the album. Usually, when I hear Mary is coming, I would move mountains to be the first in line, but it seems Mary's lost a bit of edge/energy. Perhaps the P-Diddy reunion wasn't so good after all. Some things are better left unchanged. It wasn't broken, why'd you try to fix it ma? Anywho...Love At First Site 5/5 body bouncerFriends 5/5 keeping it on the real, real, for real!Ooh! 5/5 should have been hotter on the airwaves. Don't know what happened.Not Today 5/5 nothing but attitude.I wish artists would stop talking about where they been and all that gibberish and just sing.Overall, Love & Life is just making the cut in the Mary collection. No matter, I will always support Mary she is the picture of perserverance and strength and I love her for that."
5,The best ever,Mary has done it again for her fans. This album his the best yet. She is truly the Queen of R&B.
3,................,"Normally I love just about anything Mary puts out. This time was just uhhhhhh. This is one very talented woman and she deserves everything she has, but for some reason this album just doesn't do it for me. I bought it and listened to it through a few times today just to see if it would click. It was decent but not up to true mary quality. Music seems to be dying and this cd is no exception. Although it is better than most out there now, its not at all what i thought it would be."
3,Ultimate Cheeseburger.....Lovin' Life.,"Mary has done it again. Another album, another day. Another same ole same ole. It's a good album, but not enough groovy trax. I really dig ""Willing and Waiting"" (cool sample), ""Love @ 1st Sight"" (sex on a platter, Ok gurrl), ""Ultimate Relationship"" (classic R&B jamm), ""When We"" (infectious!!) and the interludes......(why did they fade out the potential best trax on the album?). The rest of it can bite me."
3,Mary Takes Us Back To The Early 90's,"""Love and Life"" is good. That's it, just good. Mary has gone back to what made her popular in the first place. Singing new lyrics over old samples backed by a programmed drum machine which was o.k. back when she released ""My Life"". But after hearing and loving her last project, ""No More Drama"", I was pleased with the fact her tracks were new, different and fresh. Her vocals on this new project are full of emotion, crisp, and very straight forward. It's a really tight album with dancable tracks like ""Ooh"", ""All Of My Love"" just to name a few.In Short, R&B music has gotten somewhat back to origionality where sample-laden tracks like the ones on this project are not needed thanks to producers like the Neptunes, Mario Winans, Rodney Jerkins and Dr. Dre ( who produced ""Not Today"" ) But overall ""Love & Life"" is good, nothing really innovative or different....just good."
1,NOT A PLEASANT LISTENING EXPERIENCE!,"Being a MJB fan since the beginning, I must say this effort is absolutely embarrassing. The music or should I say the beats and countless samples (thanks alot Puff) are elementary, there's no real instrumentation; everything sounds programmed, and the most shocking thing for me are the vocals which are horrid, ill-structured, and off key throughout the whole cd. I'm thankful I got a chance to preview it on AOL which saved me from wasting my hard earned cash. I checked it out from the library because the quality was not that great on AOL and it still has that nails scratching a chalk board effect on me. The only decent cut is the final track ""Ultimate Relationship (AM)."" Mary you got too much talent and heart for this type of material."
2,No inspiration...no soul,"After listening to this CD for a few weeks, it is painfully obvious that the creative forces behind this product lacked any real inspiration. The beats are tired. The songs are lackluster. Why deviate from the winning formula that was ""No More Drama""? ""Family Affair"" was #1 for months. Hopefully Mary will trust her instincts next time...from the DVD that accompanies the CD, you can tell that she wasn't feeling it...nor is radio or the consumer. After two failed singles, this CD has plummeted off the charts. Puffy is old news, and it's time for Mary to start really singing again and work with some contemporary producers. More than likely, a greatest hits package is going to drop next year...wait to buy that. I'm sure that it will contain the 'best' of what this CD has to offer, which, sadly, isn't much. A severe disappointment--and I think she's great."
1,DISAPPOINTED!!!!,"I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE DISAPPOINTING RELEASE THAN THIS ONE. SHE HAS NEVER RELEASED AN ALBUM AS POOR AS THIS ONE SINCE SHE'S BEEN PERFORMING. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE REUNION WITH P. DIDDY OR SHE JUST TURNED IN THIS LACK LUSTER EFFORT AND THOUGHT IT WAS COOL. I ACTUALLY GAVE THE CD AWAY....THE FRIEND I GAVE IT TO WASN'T IMPRESSED, EITHER."
3,"Good, But Not What I Expected",Mary and Puffy's album Love and Life was alright. But not her greatest effort to date.Best Songs:Let Me Be the OneLove @ 1st SightNot Today
3,Good but Mary can do better,"Mary returns with her 6th album but instead of taking steps forward she takes a couple of steps back which is what kind of disappointed me about this album, although it is a solid album I would say its the worst out of all of her albums, the best tracks are:Don't GoFeel like making lovewhen weAll my loveFriendsultimate relationshipITs a wrapThe rest of the songs are good but could have been better, I still love you Mary but next time don't let Puffy take over your whole album."
3,Pretty good shape,"The outside of this copy is in excellent shape but a previous reader had highlighted sections, something not mentioned by the seller. Because of that, only 3 stars."
5,"Great Poetry, Fun Story!","I think that this story has good poetry, great old fashioned pictures, and is a lot of fun. It takes care of the Halloween story and Thanksgiving in one swoop. The poor pumpkin is mishapen and is considered ugly. Others play jokes on it and no one takes him home. Does the story have a happy ending? We'll see!"
5,Best book,One of the funniest books for children to read. My kiddies are in love with this book. I never purchase books at the book store but online and definitely a better buy on amazon.
5,Decent Remaster,"I'm sure most people who consider buying this already have it in another form (i.e. LP, CD, or tape) and already enjoy the music. Looking at this title with that frame of mind, and comparing it to the older version of the CD, the sound is slightly improved. In addition the casing is shaped and designed like a small version of the LP release. The insert also has some nice reads that weren't included in previous releases. I would recommend purchase of this only if you have an audiophile system and can appreciate the slight sound improvement or if you'd like the great packaging. If you only have this on LP or cassette, it's a no brainer to buy this. If you want to hear some unbelievable sounding remasters check out Deep Purple Machine Head 25th Anniversary Remaster or the Beatles One. These will make your jaw drop at how great they sound and make you wonder why all remasters can't sound this good. I guess source tapes."
5,awsome,"this album rocks.especially the song,""indiscipline"".im glad i found this on amazon.big loss for i tunes for not putting this on their catalog."
4,"Not the best for beginners, but a good, manga-style story.","Blue destiny is the story of a young MS pilot and his platoon. I really enjoyed this books style and the flow it used. There is probably some other stuff you should know about the Gundam universe that would make this a more wide appealing story, but it isn't absolutely necessary. All in all, a fine story that is well drawn."
4,Good. Could be better.,"This is a pretty cool manga. You may need to read it a few times to understand it due to numerous plot twists and flash-back sequences. If you're a fan of the Wing series, this may be a good intro to the Universal Century timeline. As for the plot, it's a bit slow at points, but great battle scenes make up for it. Overall, 4/5 is just about a perfect rating for this manga."
3,Reason,"I know that lots of people (like myself) buy these books because they love watching Gundam Wing on Cartoon Network. The reason that Heero Yuy and the other Gundam pilots aren't in this book is because Gundam had many different seasons and Gundam Wing is one of the newer seasons. This book is probably based on another season. But if you're a really big Gundam fan, then you shouldn't mind the fact that Heero isn't in this book:)"
5,Classic Rush,It is a masterpiece in music. It is like discovery all over again. It is still in my car stero.
1,2112 very disappointing,"Nowhere near the audio quality of ""Moving Pictures"" and the 5.1 mix falls way short of my expectations. I would have liked some well timed & tastefully mixed surround trickery. Not worth the money spent."
4,An excellent addition to the canoe building literature.,This book has two great features. One is the fantastic color photographs showing the process of building a wood strip canoe. The second is that the author answers questions and gives details of construction that most other authors on the subject gloss over or ignore. The only negatives are the poor quality binding and the tiny size of the print.
1,A poor rehash,"Like the other wood strip boat building books around, what is ommitted is more important than what is included.The most important ommission: After you have made all of your material and construction choices and have a finished ""boat"", how do you determine if the boat is save for your spouse to paddle alone?A boat that looks nice is not always a boat that is safe to paddle."
1,Waste of time,"A remarkably shallow read. Failed to live up to the cover hype of ""packed with must-read insights"" and ultimately delivered a surprisingly little amount of information about Oracle and/or Ellison.Skip this one."
2,The sum up of 2 good books,"If you read Stuart Read`s""Oracle Edge"" and Mike wilson`s ""The difference between God and Larry Ellison"" don`t bother to read this one.The only new fact is that relates to pos-September 11th facts in the company and the general economy.Following the tradition of the other books under the pen name Rebecca Saunders, it is a very superficial description with magazine-type titles."
2,Only the brief footage of Nityananda and Nisargadata Maharaj are worthy.,"Howdy....the short footage of Sri Sri Nityananda [approx 2 minutes] although of poor quality, is priceless. The footage of Nisargadata Maharaj if fabulous.The actual discourse by Dr. Wolinsky, for me, is just a bunch of blah, blah, blah. The words of the great beings cannot be improved upon in a discourse.For me, all I want is to see and hear the Great Beings and there's not enough of that here for my money."
1,Nothing special.,"The writing is bad, the plot is old, and the whole idea of a little utopian community in the post-Apocalyptic US has been done so many times, it has to at least have an interesting twist to hold my attention.I could have ignored all that if I cared about the characters at all. But each of them was a walking stereotype, from the wise older woman to the warrior to the innocent outsider. The only character who showed even the slightest spark of life was the healer who kept hitting on every woman who walked by.The secrets from the past that kept coming up weren't at all believable for the characters. I was reminded of the end to Scooby-Doo cartoons, or Hardy Boys books. (""Ha ha, I was the traitor all along! And you never suspected anything! Now let me tell you all about my plan while I lower you into a vat of acid!"")I like mindless entertainment as much as the next person, but it has to actually be entertaining, and this isn't."
2,"fend off wolf packs or man (not),","I bought a Black Sjambok - 42"" to fend off wolf packs when I walk in the wilderness. Once, I was attacked and couldn't use it so I was severely bitten several times before a passerby scared the wolves with a loud horn. It's not very good for fast attacking animals which are highly mobile and work in groups. Might be good for snakes or rabid skunks, but not much bigger. Probably worthless against an armed man as well."
5,A classic...,"As I say, a classic... I'm a little surprised that it just have one review - I'll do something about that and add mine!""Just after dark on a busy street he would stand there in his tight jeans, and the cars would slow down a little as they cruised by...These are the Phil Andros stories, classics from the sixties about a college-educated hustler who pursues every form of sex, including affection, without apology.""'Stud' is a collection of short stories. The first story, 'The Poison Tree', was published in 1963 and the collection of 12 stories in 1969.The author, Phil Andros, is the pen name for Samuel M Steward, a Ph.D in English literaturen and long time friend of Gertrud Stein and her companion, Alice B. Toklas - their letters to him was published in 1977 under the title 'Dear Sammy'."
2,Not Earthseed,"I read ""Earthseed"" as a teenager and loved it. It was a story my middle school students loved too. They always wanted more and I did too. I looked forward to reading ""Farseed"" and discovering the fates of the characters after almost 20 years.""Farseed"" is not about the characters introduced and explored in ""Earthseed"". It is about a teenage girl who is abused as a girl and must find strength to look past the biases of her childhood to help people she was taught to hate.The story introduced in this second part of the trilogy is boring, hard to read, and not a good follow-up to the first tale. This story drags to the ninth degree and makes me feel really disapointed in the author and the fate of a story introduced in the stunning first book."
4,Setting a new standard...,While many call this album'progressive'-and justifiably so-it is more than that:it is a self-contained universe of musicianship and ideas that transcends boundaries.The fantastic interplay between the musicians on this record has more to do with jazz than rock;at the same time they manage to understate their great virtuosity with the result of creating a classical musical tableau-it is probably one of the great recordings of the century.
4,Rush - Their Commercial Peak,"""Moving Pictures"" would prove to be the band's commercial peak. Like ""Permanent Waves"" before it, the album would feature shorter songs with only one clocking in at over 10 minutes. The album produced two huge hits in ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"" both songs still staples of classic rock radio. The instrumental ""YYZ"" remains a fan favorite to this day as well. Most Rush fans consider this one to be the band's all time classic. I like it a lot, but there are other Rush discs that I like better. The first 6 tracks are the strong point with the hits ""Red Barchetta and ""The Camera Eye"" all being great tunes. The last two tracks ""Which Hunt"" and ""Vital Signs"" kind of end the disc on a slightly lower note although they are both decent as well. I have never thought ""Moving Pictures"" was as good as a lot of Rush fans seem to rate it, but it remains a good disc and took Rush to the peak of their commercial success."
2,Hollow and Lifeless,"Fellow musicians may admire their radiant technical abilities but, to most of us, Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson, better known as Rush, make a pretty hideous combination. Not only are Mr. Lee's high-pitched vocals capable of startling every canine within a five mile-radiance of his revolting shriek, but his lyrics are some of the most pretentious, ridiculous and overtechnical blather in rock history. In the background, Mr. Peart and Mr. Lifeson meander on, spewing instrumentation that is as clean-cut and precise as one could hope, but does not have a drop of soul. A gratuitous layer of synthesizers completes this smooth, anti-septic product. Even Moving Pictures, their most accessible album (that at least spares listeners the Ayn Rand garbage) is an overglossed, hollow, lifeless creation. I may not know how to tune a guitar by ear or how to use a capo but I think I can tell that Rush is a...band."
1,SEll OUT,"Rush wanted to get on the radio so Neil Peart decided to write Limelight and Tom Sawyer. He sold out and it worked. They got FM air play. Gone are the days of 2112 and Hemipheres,where originallity and substance were key to their early unique song writing. MTV garbage is what we have hear. Yes YYZ is the best song on the CD. Witch Hunt also shows some promise. Other than that this was the beginning of the end for Rush"
5,Rock Classic and Masterpiece,"Rush really epitomizes the raw creative power that happens when the band has collaborative synergy. I mean is there really more to say about this? The band members stand out on their own talents but it comes together as a whole. ""Moving Pictures"" is one of those ""must-have"" rock CDs, a la ""Led Zeppelin IV"" or ""Boston""."
4,'My uncle has a country place'............,"Rush's 'Moving Pictures' is like what 'No More Tears' is to Ozzy, and 'Number of the Beast' is to Iron Maiden. It's the cream of the crop, the best of the artists's catalog. This Canadian powerhouse was formed in the early 1970's, playing hard-driving progressive rock. Starting with this album, in 1981, they started to play more synth-based, less progressive hard rock. Later on, they got a little too synthesized, but this album is probably their best. It includes the hard rocking smash hit 'Tom Sawyer' as well as the rather straightfoward 'Limelight'. Another standout track is the hard rocking highway song 'Red Barchetta'."
5,My First and Favorite Rush Album/CD,"This is probably my favorite album of all time. Every song is a classic. ""Perfection"" comes to mind in describing Moving Pictures. If you don't own this one your not a fan of RUSH. Order it now and you will be a fan for life, no doubt."
2,Disappointed - DVD Audio,DVD Audio version: I have a fairly high end 7.1 system with a 250W sub-woofer. What can I say. Clarity is a bit better than a remasterd CD. Surround field is essentially non-existent; a bit used on Camera Eye and Vital Signs. Limelight seems to have the most clarity increase. Overall I find it a bit muddled for a DVD-Audio. Geddy's bass is very low. I'll probably send it back.I have an older Pioneer DVD-Audio/Video player so the album tracks can only be played thru the analog multi-channel inputs. The videos can be played 5.1 thru the optical inputs (they are not 96k).
2,Poor audio quality,People who works in this remaster maybe work in hard way. But the result is not big deal if you compare with others remasters done to the other records from the same age.Don't buy this one if you exected excellent sound. Buy it if you're a Rush fan.
3,Great Band,This CD doesn't sound as clear as my older (original release) CD. It sound/seems washed out IMHO. It doesn't matter how I tune my player.
3,not quite what I was hoping for,The main gripe I have about the blu-ray is it does not have a lossless hd format like some movies have. I use a Yamaha YSP 4100 sound processor to listen to audio and video and the lossless discs I have sound better. The processor has a limited sound field and cannot reproduce a pure soundtrack.
3,Where's the bass ?,I was expecting this to sound as good the snakes and arrows limited edition DVD but it falls short. I was hoping the drums would be exploding out of my subwoofer but I didn't hear that. The sound is kind of thin but it is very clear and detailed. I seriously doubt the blue ray edition sounds any better than the DVD version but I'll leave that for others to determine. This definately not a five star compilation so I am wondering what I am missing. It's a toss up whether I would recommend this if you already have the CD.
5,I don't like rock and roll music but I bought this CD anyway,"I am not a fan of rock and roll music (I think Mozart is the nearest thing to a God to ever walk the Earth) but I appreciate talent and virtuosity in any genre. My son told me to listen to Rush, so I borrowed some CDs and was generally unimpressed--until I heard ""YYZ"". The extraordinary precision of this three-man group combined with exceptional production and mixing just astounded me. Of the 80+ CD's that I own, this is the only non-classical one, and I find that I play it more than any other, partly because I enter IASCA stereo competitions (I have an absolutely killer stereo in my old station wagon!) and the production values of this CD are so high that it showcases my stereo better than any other CD I have. None of the other Rush CD's I have heard excite me, but I highly recommend this one."
5,Old but still great,A great CD of the 80's . fine musicians and so powrefull . great for the technical rock fan and musician alike.
5,NOTHING COMES CLOSE!!!,"IN TERMS OF RUSH ALBUMS THIS IS THEM AT THEIR PRIME. A NON STOP ROCKER!!I FIND MYSELF WISHING THEY HAD PUT 10 SONGS ON HERE INSTEAD OF 7. BECAUSE IT'S OVER AND YOU STILL WANT MORE. EVERY CUT GIVES 100% OF THE RUSH EXPERIANCE. THEIR NEXT BEST ALBUM IS ""2112"". BUT THIS ONE IS HEAD OF THE CLASS."
5,Few bands in any genre are as musically complete.,"I'm one of the few Rush fans who believes their best efforts were in the '80's. Sure 2112 was a milestone for them, but Moving Pictures, Signals and Grace Under Pressure were their best albums. Beginning with Moving Pictures, their musical maturity went beyond experimenting and into knowingly producing complete music. Peart is arguably the best pure drummer of his generation; and I don't know of any other who can write with his level of intellect. If you want to listen to magic, check out how Peart changes cadence, tempo and rhythm on Vital Signs, Limelight and Witch Hunt. For a real treat to their musical genius, get the Signals and Grace Under Pressure CDs."
2,OVERRATED..,"2 1/2 stars. I can't force myself to give this album 3 stars. But 2 is not enough. Permanent Waves was the last Great album by Rush. The Camera Eye is a rock n roller track. Glad to have seen them do it live many years ago. Limelight is also good. Vital Signs was, and still is, a testament to how terrible this band's music can be at times. YYZ is absolutely a great song, but horribly recorded. Try this: Listen to La Villa all the way through, and then listen to YYZ . You will see the sub-standard production of it. Moving Pictures is ok. I still listen to it, but not as much as their earlier stuff."
3,"I like them, but....","I went to see Rush on stage at the Paramount in Seattle in the early 70's. The opening band was Styx. As the opening band started, my friends and I continued our conversations, waiting for Rush to come onto the stage. We had never heard of Styx. Suddenly, we stopped talking. Styx just blew us away (they played songs from 'Equinox'). Rush, when they came on the stage, had lost their audience. People talked all through their set, and many walked out half way through. As a live band, they sounded all noise, especially compared to Styx. As I listen to this album, they still sound like that. I can sit through one or two songs, then the rest sound all alike. They may be stylistic pioneers, but they don't have much range in that style. It gets boring. I think that's why the Seattle audience chose Styx over them."
5,The Apex of Rush,"Rush were at their mindblowing best with this record. It is one of those rare albums (yes I'm old and still call them albums), that you can play from start to finish and every track is great. They had huge releases before and after MP, but never anything as moving (no pun intended), complete and with great messages. Each of the trio's contributions are exceptional here, in my opinion no one really stands above the rest. My favorite song on here is the lesser-played ""Camera Eye"" which is the most progressive track on the album and one that has sadly never been on any of the many tons of live releases that have come afterward. I wish they would cover it someday! Also, don't listen to ""Red Barchetta"" if you have a fast sportscar with a great audio system in it. You will get a ticket..."
5,If you want to rate this album try to use the milky way,"The best progressive rock album ever, from the best progressive rock band on the planet. No further explanation is needed."
2,Exceptionally poor quality recording,"I read other reviewers' opinions that the quality of this recording was poor. But I though, hey, this is Blu Ray audio - they must be crazy. So I ordered it... and now I am sending it back. The sound on this is indeed extremely poor. Do yourself a favor and get the Chronicles CD - it will give you all the high points of Moving Pictures, and then some, with better audio."
