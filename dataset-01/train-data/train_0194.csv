5,Chess for Success award for Clarity,This book clearly demonstrates all the elementsthat compose a classical chess game. Sections aredevoted to the concepts of space and time and manyother important ideas needed to reach master level.
4,"Great for teaching ""Rag"" to Kids!!!","I teach over 700 elementary students about the elements of art and music once a month. I look for original recordings from the artists so that the children can hear the actual artists perform and get a sense of the quality of the technology during the times. When explaining ""Rag"", the children are told about the history of the music and about the felt worn off the keys or even removed from the keys. They get that sense from this recording... I wouldn't want a highly digitized, quality production that distorts the reality of the music..."
5,Heavenly Lemony Olive-y Oil,This olive oil is sublime. The lemon flavor and scent is not too over-powering. I'm looking forward to finding all kinds of reasons to use it!
3,I'll Fly Away -,"I thought I was purchasing both the lyrics and music, and this is only the music. Beautifully done, but NOT what I wanted."
5,THE BEST BOOK ON LAWRENCE EVER,"Having read everything ever written on Lawrence, and even written a book on him myself, I can state without qualification that this book contains the best work ever produced on Lawrence ""of Arabia."" I reccomend it both to the first-time reader wanting to go beyond the Lawrence of legend, and to the long-time academic devotee of the military and intellectual career of this icon of the 20th century. Although each essay is excellent in its own way, Stang's stands out as a pillar of Lawrence scholarship."
5,Awesome mirrors,"These mirrors are easy to see out of when I have my camper on my pickup,they are easy to install and require no modification what so ever!!!Power and heat functions just as the factory mirrors did. I have nothing bad to say about these mirrors or my experience on Amazon.com."
3,Cipa 73500 Dodge Ram mirrors,"I bought these mirrors to replace the stock Dodge mirrors because I recently bought a 5th wheel and needed the additional length to be able to see behind me. Installation was easy and took 2 people about 45 minutes. The mirrors are huge compared to the stock ones. I have found visibilty very limited due to the fact that the mirrors are flat or curved the wrong way. The view on the passenger side is very limited bordering on dangerous. The stock mirrors offer much better visibilty during normal driving. I was given smaller curved mirrors which are totally useless. I am very disappointed in these mirrors. They do not fold back far enough to run through a car wash. If the mirrors had some concvex curvature to them instead of concave they would be much better. Overall, I would seriously consider purchasing another brand of mirror other than the Cipas. These are my first Cipa mirrors and my last. It's been a very expensive mistake. Don't do it."
3,The New Male Sexuality (Reviewed by a Sex Educator),"As a sex educator who works heavily with the gay community, I wanted more from the book. Parts are really helpful, but then I saw that it was printed in the mid 90's. The field of sex and sexuality moves pretty quickly due to more and more scientific studies being done, and this book just lacks all that updated information.It's a good baseline book, but not great for dealing with newer issues or challenges."
2,Looks like a stolen book,Although I was expecting a secondhand book I am sure I have received a stolen book from a US University. Thats a bit low.
1,New male sexuality? I think not.,"The title of this book is misleading. to call it the new male sexuality is quite the statement and one would thinkit encompasses all forms of male sexuality. This is not the case. I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book. The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist. This is not the new male sexuality. Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position. Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques. The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up. there are other areas to be explored as well. If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere."
1,ho-hum...more of the same,"In a phrase, this book is dangerously disingenuous, painfullydisregarding honorable and edifying moral imperatives, venereal diseaseaware-conservatism and prudent common sense. In some places the book is just flat wrong. The fact is, now, in the age of a mutating incurable viruses and pandemic VD, ""If-it-feels-good-do-it"" and other forms of 60's self-expression are dangerously misplaced. I thought I would be reading a solid, respected treatise based on sound empirical data. I was wrong. Read and believe at your own risk."
4,Tolkien does not disappoint,"I picked up this book also because of the author's name, but found it a great read that kept my interest throughout. It is well written, and unlike many current mystery best sellers, has a well developed plot that is consistent and credible throughout. The characters are well developed and complex, as real human beings are. I truly did not know until the end what the resolution would be, and that is rare these days. I read 7 to 10 books a week, and this is one of the best"
4,"This was an interesting and readable book, but there wasn't really any suspense as to whodunit. But good character development.","This was an interesting and readable book, but there really wasn't any suspense as to ""whodunit."" Good character development. I found it unusual that Lady Anne was so compliant with her husband's dependence on his PA, a lovely attractive woman.Most women would be very apprehensive about the situation."
3,3.5 stars - An interesting legal thriller,"This was an interesting legal thriller with little time spent in the courtroom, although was interesting to see the English legal system. Even though the characters were a bit stereotypical and the ending predictable, I still found myself turning the pages. It's a good first book."
3,Good 1st book,I picked up this book because it WAS a courtroom drama without knowing who the author was til I read about him in the back cover.I had no problem following the plot and knew that had to be the connection of the accused to the mystery man before it was stumbled on almost belatedly by the boy for the final witness.I found a few inconsistencies in the editing but nothing serious. Namely the ability of Sir Peter to reach his home by phone after it had been explained the phone lines had been cut outside the home requiring Tom to run to the neighbors to call emergency.All in all I think the author did a bang up job for a first novel
1,Too bad my last name isn't Shakespeare,"There is absolutely no way Mr. Tolkien could have gotten this crap published if he had a different last name. Gramps was able to create rich colorful characters who happened to be elves and hobbits without, presumably, ever meeting one. His grandson writes like he has never met a human being. People simply don't act like the characters in this book do. All creaky chess-piece moves are simply to propel the plot weakly along, and never have the ring of truth. This is clearly the worst ""thriller,"" to use that term very losely, I have read in years."
5,Great!,"A total surprise when I came across the band via a compilation. I had to get the CD and was not disappointed in any way. Dream Theater, Queensryche are indeed comparators but the band has its strong own identity."
4,Excellent Movie...How can the one star above be true?,"Sounds like the person commenting above has a personal issue with someone in this movie. The ratings/review are supposed to be honest so that people can decide on whether to buy this movie not slam it unnecessarily......how sad to use this area in such a biased manner! This movie is a great entertainment value with an excellent storyline. It's worth the money in my opinion! The film brings together actors from the classic ""The Bad Seed"" and greats such as Mickey Spillane make guest appearances for a ""chillingly good"" movie!"
3,"The ""Drama"" section","Hearing about this movie, I looked for it first in the horror section of blockbuster. At first I was confused as to why it would be in drama, but i picked it up anyway. The tape was old, and well warn, but I looked past the fuzzy lines to the movie itself. Enjoyable and amusing, it was an overall good movie. Where lack of funds might have left the movie a bit shaky, the acting made up quite well. The cop and daughter were the most admirable of the cast. You have my permission to view this movie. It's a good rent/bye. Have fun, and take a drink for every time they say ""mommy"" during the movie."
3,"Nice design, scratchy sheets, but OK","Not 400 count sheets, but OK for a kid who is a light sleeper anyway. He totally loved the design."
1,Go (away) white girl go (away) white girl go!,"At first, you think you are listening to a mix tape for a cheerleading dance routine. Then, you think you've been attacked by Vanilla Ice's little sister. Then, you start looking for your receipt from this purchase so you can go get your money back. In our case, we received it for free...So, we're going to make a frisbee or coaster out of it. If you wear a hearing aid, I would suggest removing it before listening to this cd."
1,The company won't stand behind their decription!,"We recently searched for a cheaper source for this paper and found it through databazar or E-max as they state on Amazon. The description for the product was listed as ""Xerox Multipurpose Pastel - paper - 5000 pcs. ( 3R11056 )"". It showed a list price of $84.99 and was discounted to $13.80. A great price for this paper considering the amount they advertised. Of course it was too good to be true. They quickly told us that the website was wrong and we had only been charged for 500 sheets of paper and that we could keep it or return it but they would not fill the order! Their customer service is located in another country and although I am a male I was called Madam over and over. Don't trust them. If you list it sell it! The paper showed up half open and the package was clearly torn open to check the color!"
3,Stalag Luft,"This had such potential with a top cast and great plot, but the script seemed to let it down. It just didn't seem to flow and instead of laughing alot I only smiled a bit. Could have been done better."
2,good cast wasted,"Here we have a top-rate cast that should've been a first-rate comedy but has a leaden script and no direction whatsoever. As it is, the movie just limps along."
1,Cheap oil with fragrance added,This is just cheap oil with fragrance added. A sharpie pen written on bottle for scent added. No seal on cap. Oil smells bad on outside of bottle. Greasy and not good quality oil. Can buy your own oil and add scent yourself.
4,musical masala,"Since Trilok Gurtu is not a vocalist, it's difficult to know what to expect from a CD that contains a lot of vocal tracks. Broken Rhythms proves you need only expect something great and you will not be disappointed. The music is both very Indian and very contemporary without falling into the genre of Bollywood or Bhangra. And the fact that it is both distinctly Indian and contemporary is what I particularly like about the CD. For often times Gurtu collaborates with other internationally renowned artists at the risk of letting his work fall into the realm of ""world"" music. This is the CD to change that perception. Here, tabla, sitar and traditional Indian folk instruments are deftly arranged with contemporary percussion, bass and guitar. The vocals add variety and character to the music without distracting from the hot percussive rhythms of which Gurtu is the master."
1,Home Design Platinum V10,"This is without doubt the most unstable platform I've ever been associated with. The software crashes every other save. They certainly need a lot more development here. But besides the platform, getting familiar with the software and its use is fairly easy. The software provides many different pre-built blocks, but if you're design calls for something not provided customizing it is a little difficult and very time consuming. I've not gone to construction from plans with this software and do not know how good/bad the plans can be built on. I am an engineer and a user of AutoCad (Computer Drafting Software). I bought the software to help clients who have difficulty envision what their finished product will look like, and to this point the software does this very well. Because of the software's problems I would not recommend it to anyone in the building/construction industry."
3,It would be a great software when they do other updates,"I bought the software 3 weeks ago 'couse I was In a hurry to make a designI did it in 2 days and looks nice. the only problem is all the bugs it has, some times our entire screen desapear, the help is not accurate (when you follow step-by-step instructions you can find the options on the menu).Pros: Very easy to learn and use, a lot of optionsCons: The tech support never answer you, looks like the where in a hurry to lounch the program to the public and they forgot a lot of things. The let a lot of littler errors and bugs.Maybe in a year or so (after the updates) it will be an excellent software."
3,"Great software, bad mouse cursor","Bought this software a few weeks ago. I really like all the features, and it runs on Vista too. It's not that difficult to use as some people said, just take an hour to view all video tutorials and you're good to go. The only thing I don't like about this software is the mouse cursor. There is no arrow on the cursor so you'll have to guess the exact point the mouse acts on. I wish there's a downloadable patch to fix this UI issue."
2,Looks nice but...,"Great for people that has been using it for years, not that great for beginners... it's hard to learn. Even with there video tutorials..."
5,KILLER OLD SKOOL MUSIC!!,"I was about 14 when I first heard this very album, and I still have the concert video of this show to this day. I am now 27. Anyway, I still like this album `cause it still hangs!! They sound like old Iron Maiden. And this live disc is definetly there best album...(almost hard to believe it's live!) It's flawless, especially for a live album! Killer guitar work, (along with everything else), jam it, your missin' out on a time piece... That has so far stood the test of time!!! This is the most known album by any Lizzy Borden fan. And by the way, Live and let Die is 100% better than GnR's version, and Lizzy Borden did it first, long ago!"
5,Excellent Disc.,"I won't repeat all the praise, however if you aren't listening to this on a player which will decode HDCD you really are missing out."
2,"A lot of useful information, but carelessly presented.","This is a very disappointing book and not recommended for someone who has not worked with previous versions of Photoshop, or anyone who is easily frustrated by poorly presented information. Although Mr. Clark appears to be knowledgeable about the content, he and his editor were very careless about the development of many of the lessons. Topics do no flow in a logical progression. References are made to tools or techniques that have not been covered in earlier lessons. References to tools are not easy to follow and are not supported through repetition or consistent visual clues. Several demonstrations are made without file references which makes it very difficult for the reader to follow along. Some files are in the wrong folders, some are missing and others are defective. There is a great deal of useful information in the book, but it was obviously rushed to press before it was ready for publication."
2,cd examples do not correspond to chapters,Not well thought through. Some examples on CD either do not correspond to chapters or are missing. Not well-arranged for beginner. Some vitally useful information in a box on page 96 that should have been in first chapter. Photoshop Classroom in a Book much better arranged.
4,"A good ""learn the basics"" book - tutorial based","This book is certainly for those who have little or no experience with Photoshop, rather than people upgrading to v5 from earlier versions. Well written in easy to understand English, the author provides a step by step guide to Photoshop in tutorial form for the reader to work through at their own pace, from introducing the PS environment to using special effects. On the downside, the colour management sections are a little confusing however, and in some cases totally misleading, so beware chapters 7 & 16."
1,A bit disappointing,This book contains no instructions and I should have researched it better before I purchased it. I would not purchase it again because I was really wanting some instructions.
3,Weirdest book I have ever read,"Simon's saga is an okay tool to study for the SAT. I know, I used it myself. Some words are helpful but others are painfully simplistic.SPOILER ALERT:The story gets really weird later on in the book. Nothing I've found mentions the weird 'twist' the story has.Basically, the world is infested by aliens and Simon has to murder 'the controller.' It's really, really odd. For a book about the SAT, it doesn't really make sense to have such a weird plot. It's not a novel, it's a freaking study guide! Besides, it advertises itself as a story about college life and mentions nothing about cracking open heads on sidewalks.END SPOILERS.Frankly, the tone of the author got annoying to me, fast. Simon's banter and Axel's stereotypical nerdiness just turned me off.I guess the book is okay if you're fine with dealing with a terrible story. It's not bad at first, but later it gets really odd."
3,Really expensive for a set of notes...,"You can find better introductions to category theory available on the net for free. Try searching for Lambert Meertens, Marten Fokkinga, and Jaap Van Oosten, for example. Or Barr and Wells, Triples, Toposes, and Theories. Or Asperti and Longo. Or watch Eugenia Cheng's videos on YouTube, which are fantastic.But if you want to buy a book, get Barr and Wells, Category Theory for Computing Science. Unfortunately, you have to order it directly from the University of Montreal. It's a great book, by far the best intro to category theory available, *way* better than this! Then, after that, you can read MacLane..."
3,Too terse,"This is a very short book: 70 pages of text + a bibliography. The first 50 pages are about general category theory, and the last 20 pages are specifically for computer scientists. My interest is in general category theory, and I bought this because I have a BS in CS and thought I'd find plenty of familiar examples. Unfortunately this book doesn't have nearly enough examples. I found it easier to skim some undergrad abstract algebra books in the library (groups, rings, vector spaces) and then continuing with category theory intros written for math students."
2,Basic crib sheet for category theory,"Anyone coming to this book from Pierce's ""Types and Programming Languages"" will be disappointed. While his ""Types ..."" book is a model of clear exposition, this book reads like a set of notes jotted down on the back on an envelope. The extensive bibliographic sections are more than fifteen years out of date. Much of the material referenced is no longer in print, and recent developments are, of course, not mentioned. Those seeking a very gentle introduction to category theory would do better with the book by Lawvere and Schanuel, who cover more of category theory than Pierce. Mathematically mature computer science readers will find everything they need to know about the subject in Mac Lane's book."
3,What's up with the tag?!?,"My wife usually wears size 5-7 panties which should be medium, so I ordered medium, but these are a little larger. So if I were to reorder this item, I would go a size smaller than what is usually worn. Good quality material, but a big tag on the side, which will probably be a little uncomfortable when worn. Hopefully, they won't be worn long enough to bother her much. 4/1/11 UPDATE!!! My wife tried these on today, and they actually fit her perfectly; they just look larger than they actually are. However the tag is right at the top of the crack of her butt, and she says it is pretty uncomfortable. Big tags in obvious places are not the most desired feature of lingerie, so I'm lowering my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars. Still great for the price, but man that tag is obvious and distracting!!!"
2,cute...,"i got the lavender pair, and sure, they are cute...never mind the fact they arrived with tears in the lace along the seam in the front."
2,Does not last,"I purchased this a year ago on 10/20/09. I gave it to my brother in Hawaii for his B-Day, he said it is in shreds. It doesn't hold up to wind and sun, although it states that it is durable,long lasting. Disappointed that it only lasted a year outdoors."
4,Pleased,Was in the shape as stated and arrived in a timely manner. Some of the text is hard to understand but instructor does her own introduction worksheet on each section so all is good
2,So hard to use.,"I did not like this book at all. It was a waste money other then being able to tell what the class should be learning. I used the book for a online MATH 111 class, and turned to my old MATH 95 text book to work through the assigned work out of this book. I have not suggested this book to anyone but have told them to save there money and can use mine because I don't think it is worth any amount of money."
1,Very Unhappy,"I was very unhappy with this product. I typed in exactly what my university bookstore said I needed, IPN number and everything and it brought up the wrong book. Then they told me I couldn't return it. It wouldn't have been so bad if the person I talked to wasn't so rude about it."
1,"Not a good review, never recieved item.",I am very upset with the people I purchased this product from. First of all i never even received my product and when I tried to email the company as well as amazon to find out what happened and get my money back no one answered me back.
1,stolen song,"It would seem to me that anyone who's heard ""3 Second Ride"" by Cindy Black would put two and two together. Whoever wrote this song probably heard hers first. I think it's sad they can't come up with an orginal idea."
4,Speed Metal with Clarity,"This is their first album and it differs from their second and subsequent albums in the same Metal Church's do. The album sounds like Kill 'em All crossed with Iron Maiden and is a quality release, buy it, it is great stuff. I would also recommend their second offering."
2,"Y'know, Maybe Jason Newsted had his reasons...","Look, as much as it pains me to do this, I must admit that Doomsday isn't very good. I'm a huge fan of later Flotsam, and I was shocked at how pointless this album is. To be fair, you can see that F&J have potential. The guitar is quite good, if a little too aimless in places. The weaknesses include the Bass, or lack thereof. I mean you can't really even hear it most of the time. Also, Eric A.K.'s voice at this point can only be described as millions of tiny rodents nibbling on my skull. Believe me, I love good thrash, and some of this is good, but WAY too much of it is not. The songs seem to never end, and the one time I tried to sit through the whole album, I was so bored I had to turn it off most of the way through Der Feuhrer. Do yourself a favor, and get ""High"", It's a much better Album. Or any F&J Album after Cuatro, for that matter."
2,Doesn't stack up to later efforts,"I love Flotsam but this just isn't that good. The title track almost warrants 3 stars but the rest is just too cheesy. Their next album No Place for Disgrace is way better than this. This has it's moments so if you see it used real cheap it may be worth it but other than that, don't bother."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I have my own collection of books on the subject, an this one is way the worst. The authors present complicated excersises, one of them even require a JACUZZI, HELLO??? I DONT OWN A JACUZZY, And I dont even think It'd be a good Idea to have an Out-of-Body experience summerged in water. Not very safe. If you want to buy a greatbook with easy techniques buy Astral Dynamics by robert Bruce is the best of my collection and I have had great success with it. So that all."
1,Not worth it,"This book is one of the worst on the subject. Their exercises are long, overcomplicated and worst of all useless. The theory is non existant, and what you should actually experience during an OBE is for some reason omitted. In summary do not get it, buy Buhlman's book or the one writenn by Rick Stack."
3,A complete imagination techniques for OBE,"Keith Harary. You can find this name at others astral books. A good astral traveller and tested by laboratary with good result at 1970. In his book, he gave us imagination technique for 30 days with much variations each day so you can develop this ability and make you able to have an OBE. Yes,I can said this book was a guided imagination book. But you'll find how fast you'll have your OBE. Don't worry if it seems difficult to follow the instructions. Make variations ! You'll find this at the end of this book."
5,Better Than Virgin Atlantic,"Normally I don't commit to the written word, I just read them. However, after a long cool bath on a hot summer day, I found myself wanting to just float away with a good book. Oddly, my grandson Teddy rushed in from the orchard where he had been dilly dallying all day and handed me this little jem. Prayers were answered. All I needed was a little lemonade to perfect the evening. Simply put, I read, reasoned, and was ultimately guided to a world my poor ex-husband only dreamed of, rest his soul. As those British people always say, bravo."
3,30 dias de ilusión,"Compré este libro debido a que no conseguia salir del cuerpo con frecuencia. He tenido varias experiencias fuera del cuerpo. Mi desilusión viene de que gran parte del libro está dedicado a inducir el estado de 'alerta-relajada' y que puede conducir a sueños lúcidos en vez de OBE. Y ese mismo método lo utilizan estos autores en todos sus libros de 'haga esto y lo otro en 30 dias'. Si dispones de 30 dias libres de trabajo...prueba. El libro en si no es malo, pero piensalo bien antes de invertir en el."
3,this book is ok but not the best.,"I read some other books about astral projection and also checked it out on the world wide web. This book isn't very good because it's too small, but it does have some good information in it. It's not a total rip."
2,Not the best,"I read this book, tried a few of the exercises, and was very disappointed. I'm not saying this stuff won't work, I'm saying that the exercises get too complicated by the third week. And take way too long, if you are a busy person you will have to sacrifice something to make this time work. I currently also read William Bulman's book Adventures out of the Body and was very pleased. It's more detailed, the exercises are easier to do, you don't have to spend as much time to do them. It's gonna be just a matter of time before I can have my first OOB experience. But anyway, as for this book, don't buy it, just borrow it from somebody you know."
4,It worked for me anyway.,"This book was an interesting read, and I tried some of the ideas suggested in it. I can't say that I was walking through walls, or travelling through space. However, by trying the ideas suggested in this book I began to have extremely lucid dreams. I was able to become fully awake and alert in the dream state, and that was liberating in and of itself. I had never been able to do that before, and, until it happened, I didn't believe it was really possible. By the way, it's a lot of fun, but nobody will believe you if you tell them about it the next day (as I'm sure most of you reading this probably won't). It is possible, but you also have to psych yourself up for it somewhat mentally and believe. Sad to say, but I'm still in the cradle compared with those who are buzzing around their neighborhoods. Fun, easy book."
5,Upbeat melange of postpunk-power pop,THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY captures all of the music used in the film EXCEPT for the song playing during the restaurant scene when Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz are at dinner. Who is that group and why are they not on this most excellent compilation of chestnuts and new music?
4,Witty chronicle of one of the funniest films of the decade.,"Eclectic, hip mix of songs captivates with everything from classics to instrumentals."
4,A Fun Soundtrack to Listen To...,"I bought this soundtrack to obtain a copy of the ""hard-to-find"" one-hit wonder by Danny Wilson, ""Mary's Prayer"". But I found the rest of the CD is great. A good CD to listen to when your bopping down the highway."
3,There is only one reason to buy this cd:Jonathan Richman,"While the rest of the songs are either listenable throwaways(the Lemonheads/Danny Wilson) or oldies already available on anynumber of compilations (Joe Jackson/the Foundations), Jonathan sums up the motivations of every love-struck loser (both in the film and real life, as well)--no amount of logic in the world can convince a person's heart to change it's mind (if you'll pardon the Richman-esque metaphor). Your friends may know about domestic and imported ale, indeed. But they DON'T know a thing about love. Not my love anyway. Yours, either, I'm willng to bet. Some people may be put off by Jonathan's style, but such simple truths as ""True love is not nice"" might not be heard if not spoken so plainly."
4,Great -- but missing one great song,"Mary had great songs alright, and this CD is a delightful collection. However, it is missing one of the best songs from the movie -- the song that plays over the end credits. It is a really wonderful song called (I think): The Way. It is by Billy Goodrum and is on a CD of his music that is available from the Love Street Bookstore (http://www.lovestreetbookstore.com/contact.htm). Everything on Billy's CD is absolutely great. I highly recommend it."
1,This soundtrack is suck!,"If you like old and new song combined together into one album why don't you try ""The Parent Trap"" soundtrack, it's really COOL! Trust me."
3,Easy to use reference for beginners,"This is a well laid out book for beginning computer users. It is topic driven in a Q&A format.The information is easy to read but does not delve too deeply in any subject. The book is definitely geared towards new computer users with answers to questions like ""what's an ISP?""It is well priced and worth having around just because it is so easy to use."
2,second worse book I read this year,"I got intrigued by the cover summary (two people that knew each other in our time are sent back into the bodies of a medieval couple fighting each other due to the historical circumstances), but the book was poorly written. There is no real character development, no real character attributes (besides statements like ""cared for others"") that would make the couple recognize each other. It is only about the sex between a lovely woman and a brute of a man and about the mistrust between them."
2,Sorry I bought this item,"Poorly written and kind of strange. I felt like I wasted my money unfortunately I order the sequel. I couldnt even finish it, and the book went in the trash."
5,Awesome capo,"Great capo, super easy to use even for a beginner. Change positions is simple. Spring tension is spot on. Only capo I need!"
3,Completely different color!,"The product works but shipping was slow. I was upset to find that the color was completely different than what it looks like online. It's a very dark, almost maroon red. I bought this product only because of what the color was. Very disappointed. It is also extremely squeaky. Don't buy this product if you want the color the picture shows."
4,Kyser capo,"Easy to use capo. Good strength - holds the strings down well.. Not sure that it's as good as the G7th capo, which I still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune, but the Kyser is much cheaper and does a good job."
4,.,"It gets 4 stars because at heart, it is still Thought Industry, but on this, their 3rd album, something is clearly missing. I mean, other than the mandatory Salvador Dali cover art (and that absence is bad enough!) One is forced to assume that it is Dustin Donaldson, the former drummer who parted with the band after Mods Carve the Pig. Apparently he lent a great deal to the style of Thought Industry's sound, because the tracks that comprise ""Outer Space"" just aren't quite at the same level as the tracks that made up the first two albums. But Oberlin is still here, with his thesaurus, dictionary, and a pile of backissues of The Nation on hand. Which means, for those unfamiliar with TI, that the lyrics are still quite an adventure. The music is still highly unique, and there are even a few selections here that qualify as Thought Industry classics in their own way. But it is not the place to begin with this band."
4,Excellent sample,This two disc set is a good sampler of Beethoven; I had forgotten how inspiring his work could be. This set has motivated me to order all three of the Deutch Grammaphone two disc which together include all 9 of Beethoven's symphonies.
2,not the best,"i went searching for a Beethoven CD because i was lucky enough to find this wonderful Mozart one. But this Beethoven CD doesnt have the best performances. The most popular pieces are apparently played by beginners because the notes sound disjointed, as if they arent playing together but playing each piece separately, which is not what an orchestra is supposed to sound like....otherwise we wouldnt call it an orchestra....it would be an elementary school meddley! But anyway, the less popular pieces are boring, like the compilers didnt feel like paying for the good stuff. Overall, im disappointed with this CD. The picture is cool though.....(insert glaring smiley here)."
5,Vital story of an obscure time in history.,"A group of us studied this relatively unknown book several years ago, and I delight in giving copies to selective readers."
4,ZWINGLI AND INFANT BAPTISM,"This book is a worthwhile read on the subject of Anabaptism and the Reformers. Rev. Verduin has done considerable research. However, with respect to a related matter, infant baptism, the book contains a flaw. It attributes a quote to the Reformer Zwingli incorrectly. The practice of infant baptism should be cleared of this error. Dialogos Studies has done research into this matter. Don't let this error mislead you!"
5,Science of Objectivity and Subjectivity,"This book is a must for scientists as well as intellects whose are searching for the truth. Reader of this book may need a basic background of knowledge in Eastern philosophy and modern scientific theories. The main point of the book is to validate the Buddhist philosophy's subjective method and the one of two faces on the coin, similar to modern science, in searching for the truth. Buddhism further develops the idea of illusion in conventional truth and focuses instead on the absolute truth of interdependency."
4,Good Cap,This is a good gas cap. It fit my old Celica perfectly. Comes with two keys as is shown in the picture.
3,"The 50's, Through Rose (Bowl) Colored Glasses","Vera Miles, who gave memorable performances in PSYCHO and BACK STREET, is very appealing in this simple love story set against the background of the annual Rose Bowl football game. A youthful Natalie Wood plays her kid sister, with the rest of the cast filled out by some rather mature-looking college guys.The movie's plot is hardly worth mentioning, but what makes THE ROSE BOWL STORY watchable is its charming portrait of 1950's America. The opening narration (uncredited, but the voice sounds like Richard Carlson) sets the tone of the picture: this is the good old USA, land of solid citizens and proud of old-fashioned traditions.In short, if you like vintage TV shows such as ""Father Knows Best"", you'll probably enjoy this movie."
5,Wonderful Pads,"This pads are great quaality and just the right size! Love the ""little bit of color"" on my desk without being ""unprofessional""."
3,It's okay. . .,"This book was okay, just okay. In my opinion, it didn't have as good adventures as the others books had. There were some exciting parts, true; but to, me the whole book wasn't worth it. The end was disappointing and somewhat predictable.Try reading: ""While the Clocked Ticked"" the Hardy Boys book #11. Now that is some really good fiction."
5,A must read!,"I came upon this book when I was doing a book report for Language Arts class. The book is called The Great Airport Mystery. In the book valuable eletronic parts containing Platinum are being stolen from shipments from Sanwide Mining Eqipment Companys cargo planes. Frank and Joe Hardy are called to take the case. They become suspicous because there is a ghost lurking around of Clint Hill. They end up at a mountain top in Montana. With a danger filled showdown. Frank And Joe walked down the hill towards the cabin. Joe looked through a hole in the cabin and saw.....you will have to read the book to find out what happens o.k. . I hope you will read this book it is very funny,intruiging,and adventures."
4,The Great Airport Mystery,"If you like mysteries I would get to the library. The Great Airport Mystery is by Franklin Dixon. The characters are Joe, Frank, and Mr. Fenton. It takes place at an airport on a dirt road. The problem is a plane hits their car.In the beginning of the story Joe and Frank take a shortcut on a dirt road because they are late getting home for dinner. In the middle of the story they get on a helicoppter to fly around the airport and then see a tornado. To find out what happens, you will have to read The Great Airport Mystery.I think the story is one of a kind. Boys in 3rd-4th grade would like this book.C.C. in Annapolis"
5,Great Book,"The Hardys take a back route that is supposed to be ashortcut but turns out to be a timewaster when an airplane flys over their car barely missing it. They see Bush Barney and ex con in the area. Who is stealing the platnium ming item s from Stanwide. Art Rodax, Aaron Lieber, Lance Peterson or even possibly the supposdly dead Clint Hill. Find out to read..."
4,"If you like this type of music, you'll love this collection","A fun collection of easy listening classics by a great group of artists. Some are well known, some not so well known. That's part of the fun. Even the most hardcore music lover of this genre might find some new gems amongst the tracks. It is also a great value considering there are 52 tracks on the 2 cds. I recommend it!"
3,BArnes At His Best,"He may not right the same grotesc lyrics as he did for cannibal corpse but still just as effective. Alan west has great guitar skills and the beats might not be as fast as CC but hey they are just as good, for casual deathmetal use."
4,great old-metal,"great slow-paced metal. anyone that likes chris barnes will like this album. if you like old stuff, this is for you.this is like a pre-cannibal corpse band"
2,Stick with the later stuff.,"Im not hugely into death metal but SFU are one of the few bands i dont mind.Now dont get me wrong this isnt for the weak at heart but on the same note Compared to other releases its pretty tame.Unlike later releases the lyrics on this are based more on a disturbed mind than on the gore matter.Not that thats a bad thing ,it shows barnes can cover more than just sodomizing a baby when it comes to lyrics.Apart from that it really is just basic Riffs,Mid tempo songs and the occasional solo.Id reccomend maximum violence."
2,"5/10 lame, not much","If you're considering buying a Six Feet Under cd and it's not possible to stop you from buying one, buy Maximum Violence 'cause that one is good. Chris Barnes sounds so goddam weak, all the riffs are reused Obituary riffs, Final Thoughts and End Complete get a real bashing! Aside from that Enemy Inside was great, a couple of others were ok and the rest were just plain no-good, repetitive and non-brutal...stuff.And to the guy who says Six Feet Under are his favourite band and that he's been listening to Death Metal for 8 years? I feel sorry for you. No wonder the world thinks Death Metal fans are idiots, because the ones people notice ARE."
1,"garbage, total garbage","This is the sorriest excuse for death metal that I have ever heard. How can Chris Barnes go from The Bleeding to this crap? It will bore you to death. It totally lacks anything that I would consider cutting edge musicianship. It just flat out sucks and you have to be a tuneless, mindless retard to appreciate it.Awful."
4,"3.5 stars, good. decent","I own 4 of Chris Barne's CDs. (Tomb Of The Mutilated, The Bleeding, Haunted, and Alive and Dead). I'd say this CD would be tied for the 2nd best out of all of these. Mostly because of Allen West, and now you can actually hear the f*ckin vocals, before (on CC albums) it was so low pitched i couldnt tell if he was singing or if it was amp feedback.The bad thing about this album though is that, like every chris barne's cd, sounds very repitive, i've been listening to the cd and its track 6, and it sounds like 1 long song.None the less, Tomb Of The Mutilated and The Bleeding were good albums.Tomb Of The Mutilated having about 5 killer songs and 4 repetive songsand The Bleeding having about 7 killer songs and a couple repetive songsso anywayif you want some kickass death metal, get death or obituary and things of that sortif you want good/decent death metal , then this is for you."
4,Good flag,Well made and the colors never faded yet after blowing in the wind for 3 years now. Never take flag inside.
5,Great series!,"I can't wait to watch all of battle dimension! Even though they don't make complete season box sets, you can buy these at a reasonable price now. If you buy box sets 1, 2 and 3, then you will have all of Battle Dimension. On here, Amazon lists them as ""Vols. 1 & 2"" (which is all of BOX SET 1), then ""Vols. 3 & 4"" (which is all of BOX SET 2), followed by Box 3 (which is all of BOX SET 3). If you are a Pokemon fan and enjoy the anime and want to complete some dvd box sets, buy these. Like I said before, these are reasonably priced now. So enjoy!Also, if you have Pokemon Indigo League (3 box sets), Orange Islands (1 box set), Master Quest (2 box sets), Advanced (2 box sets), Battle Frontier (2 box sets), and Diamond and Pearl (3 box sets) then you must have a lot of shelf room because all together these box sets do take up a lot of space. After you get through Galactic Battles (the next season after this) then the sets get thinner to save space."
3,Still nobody knocking on my door.,"Smells OK, nothing to die for. I have tried better. Dont think it works, only the delivery man is only one knocking on my door, even before I bought this. Lol. Everybody has different chemestry, maybe it doesn't work with mine. This is something you have to try on your own to see if it works for you and you like it. For me, didn't work, dont care much how it smells."
1,lead bag,"I was so disappointed with this! The foam is hard and doesn't give at all! The zipper is broken and we just opened it-didn't even use the zipper yet! Save your money! DON""T BUY!!!!"
1,A Great Shame,"Very dissapointing album, the instrumental versions are not the originals but instead synth versions that really are weak and poor in comparision to the OST."
3,Ok... but not excellent,"I was a little disappointed when I received my cd, but I guess it was my fault... I realized when I was listening to it that some back vocals where on the ""instrumental"" versions, which means it cannot be used if you want JUST instruments..."
5,"Effective, Godly Help for Painful Circumstances","Pure and simple, this book is a blessing. From a biblical framework, Thom Gardner provides advice designed to help those who struggle with painful emotions or strongholds that stem from traumatic experiences. Gardner exposes how these bonds can rob a believer of the joy, peace, and presence of God in his or her daily life. After reading this book, I have a broader understanding of the First Commandment and will be reading more of this author's books."
2,NO support but works.,Sabrent is not the maker and do not know how it works.I Email to them ask when recorded hard disk hit full condition what happend and when camare loast video it show a dialog box do I need clcik that dialog box to make it continue or it can continue with human click on the message box. They Email back said they do not know how it works and not give the maker name.
4,simple to install and have worked rather well,"I have had 1 problem, that occasionally 1 camera drops the video feed requiring a COLD Reboot of the computer, but seems to do OK even without a lot of documentation and minimal support."
3,Not much help in the cold,"Got these hoping they would be warm as well as sturdy. They seem to be pretty sturdy, but I haven't worn them much. They're very stiff. Perhaps they need to be broken in. They don't help much with the cold either. I got the medium size to fit my hand but getting them on is a struggle because the cuff is quite small; probably to keep out the cold air. In experience, all these ""high tech"" gloves fit really well, but just don't hold up as well as the standard leather gloves. You'd be better off buying a 3 pack of sturdy leather gloves for the same price like the ones offered at Costco."
3,Not for hard work,"This gloves are not for hard work is so delicated and peal the stiches very easy, Im not recomended"
3,puzzled,this line seemed very difficult to cast after one outing with it. i am not an expert fly caster to begin with & this line was not making it any easier. maybe intended for the more experienced angler.
5,works perfectly for Video,Adding this mic to the inexpensive ATR288W 169.505 mhz for video is near perfect and for under two hundred for the ATR and this it is a score-most others are using the much more expensive lines in the wireless world so these frequencies are okay to use unless in a catering hall with five mobile DJ's etc but any other application is sweet and cheap but not cheap sounding!
4,"Neat plane, cool pictures: could stand more research","This was a nice book about a topic long forgotten buy most so it was a welcome addition. To many topics were glossed over at the end of its service life; the international cooperation Tu-144 LL being the notable example.This book is worth every penny for its pictures. Fans of the SST's should know about this book and see what an important role this plane may play in resurrecting SST again.Long live the idea of the Concorde and Tu-144, the only planes to share the dream of supersonic flight with the people."
2,Just ok,"Just ok, my kids used this more than some others. But like a lot of the Radio Disney songs, they quickly lost there appeal and the kids wanted something else."
1,The CD does not work in the karaoke machine,"I just purchased 3 CD's and a Karaoke machine for my daughter for Christmas through Amazon. 2 of the 3 CD's purchased, do not work. I am not satisfied at all with this purchase."
3,Looking for a review on this title,Just hoping to find a review for this title... if you have one... good or bad it would be nice to hear it!Thanks!
4,Great voice! Novocaine in the mouth?,"Sutherland has a super voice. She has, perhaps, the worst diction in the opera world. I sometimes like to listen to the words and follow along in the libretto. If I lose my place I cannot find it again until the next track comes up. She might as well be singing in Ubangi or Antarcticese becasue she certainly isn't singing Italian."
2,Good quality video...if the Camera's working,"My GL-2 just came back from Canon's repair shop last month - another $400 to replace the cassette drive. I paid $1900 for my GL-2 three years ago, and the most recent fix brings my grand total for repairs to $1600! Pros: Great video, great audio. Cons: This thing breaks all the time! I didn't read any reviews before I purchased my GL-2, having used Canon SLR cameras and lenses since 1993. HAVE I LEARNED MY LESSON! Just look in my wallet..not much left in there. I love my GL-2, but there are better cameras out there for the money. This model has several known defects that Canon chooses to ignore (only ten tapes through since the cassette drive was replaced the last time). I babied my GL-2 - seriously, I took better care of this than any camera I've ever owned - and it broke anyway...three times. I'm tranfering my video over to a digital hard drive and then putting my GL-2 out to pasture."
3,"There have been advances, get a better camera","The GL-2 Was great, keyword was. Time to move onto to true HD. Get a Canon 7D or 5D, the picture quality is what you need most, and this product no longer offers the goods."
1,Don't buy anything from Canon,"I own the GL2. A pixel has blown. I called an authorized Canon repair service and they told me not to bother installing a new CCD chip as that one will fail as well. And that lesson would cost me $[...] (US).I hadn't had the GL2 long enough for the Tape Cassette failure the GLS is famous for to kick in yet.It is called ""Planned Obsolescence"" and is now designed to kick in after the warranty expires.I can't recommend any Canon products. My EOS 20D camera's flash unit has never popped up. I didn't use the flash until after the warranty was up. I know I was negligent for trusting Canon's reliability but know I know better.And the Canon 50mm lens I bought new has a defect like a scratch or speck inside the lens. Also discovered too late.Read the complaints about Canon.http://www.consumeraffairs.com/cameras/canon.htmlhttp://www.eventx.com.au/avc.htmhttp://www.dvinfo.net/conf/canon-gl2-gl1-son-watchdog/32267-gl2-dead-pixel-again.htmlNever again for me."
1,Good camera Canon gl2.,I think is the best camera in the world and for a good price. Please try it and then will talk about it.
2,Good...if you're lucky,"Great camera. Fantastic quality picture, analong/digital converter throughput is great, small and lightweight. I did get the REMOVE THE CASSETTE message sometimes (it seemed most common when the battery got low) and that was always scary. I never had to send it in for repairs, though.This week I got ahold of a Sony PD-150, which I was pretty impressed with. The battery life of the PD-150 was incredibly longer than that of the Canon (even using the extended-life aftermarket batteries for the GL2). It felt strong, was only a bit bigger, and does DVCAM. I suggest you look into the PD-150/170 line.This camera is nice. It will do great work. However, I've heard too many horror stories about pried open transport doors to recommend buying it -- unless you're pretty lucky."
5,Great prosumer camera,"I purchased this camera looking to take more manual control over my video projects. And that is exactly what it has allowed me to do. It has the right balance of manual controls (as well as automatic modes) and price. It has given me the flexibility I was looking for. The weight balance is good, the controls are easily accessible and battery life is very good."
1,Error messages,I bought this over the Sony and I regret it. I get a tape eject error every time I try to rewind. I can only rewind at 10 second intervals before I get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again. That's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape. Many Canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired. Canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item. I will never buy Canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem.
1,Decent Camcorder.....But I still regret it,"My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1.I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events.The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony.The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera.However, beware of the rebate offer.I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected.The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code.If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony."
1,flaws in ths camcorder,There are few flaws with this camcorder. Power save function automatically shuts off the camcorder ever when you are in recording mode. This does not happen always but once in a while you get this. Please read reviews from various sites before buying this expensive one.
2,"Great camera, but prone to costly repairs","I have had my Canon GL2 for several years. It worked fine for the first 2 years or so, then I got the dreaded ""Remove the Tape"" error. After looking online, I saw that a lot of others had the same problem, and that the only solution was to send it in for replacement of the tape drive mechanism -- to the tune of $250.I bit the bullet, sent it in, and it came back fixed --- for a while. Now it's about a year after the fix, but I only used the camera a few times, and the problem has returned.The camera is easy to use, and shoots good video, but if I had to do it over again, I would go with another manufacturer. For [...]bucks, thething ought to work. My experience with this camera, and previous digital still cameras is that Canon quality/longevity leaves a lot to be desired.My old (10 yrs) Sony digital 8 camera is still going strong. I will look at Sony and Panasonic to replace my Canon, and never go back."
5,Great camcorder,"I think this is an awesome camcorder for its intended target market and purpose. The results are pristine and every button and function just works great without being overcomplicated. This is one camera where you don't have to read the instruction manual to figure it out. You have to maintain and clean the camera from time-time to deliver maximum potential, but it's not a hassle. And don't switch tapes often - stick with one brand. This is a camcorder I cannot do without."
1,A 20 hour camera,"I own 2 Canon GL2's. The picture is really great when the camera is new. I use a VCR to import video for editing. After about 20 hours of use I can no longer use the vcr. I must use the camera to import video. I have had both cameras fixed twice for $240 dollars each time. After 5 months one went bad again. I went back to Canon and they have now raised the price to $400 for the same repair.They claim parts are hard to get. This is a current model! I have sworn off Sony, now it's Canon's turn. By the way the problem is caused by the same issue as the eject message, The tape transport."
4,Canon GL-2,"I just bought this camcorder and I really like it. I had thoughts of buying the Xl1s, but I decided to save some money and buy the Gl-2. The image quality is great and it also offers great audio controls. The one thing that I wish it had is the ability to use other lenses. Other than that though, it is a great camcorder."
3,fire wire problems,"I love the camera, however i've been having firewire problems with it since i got it.At first i thought it was my software-not,then the firewire itself-not.It is the port on the camera that is the problem. the conncection doesn't seem to complete the interface and it flashes 'dv in'and never stays connected,needless to say this is frustrating.I have to use another camera to upload footage into my editing program-is anyone else having this problem?"
2,After the warrenty runs out,"In a two-year span I have done three important projects that went to DVD and maybe five family home videos. I'm getting pretty good at using manual settings to get rich colors and high quality shots. But lately, as I watch the video from the last two projects I am noticing a couple of dead pixels, tiny white spots that are always there. They are especially noticeable when you zoom in on someone's face. So on the next project I borrowed a GL2 from my friend to avoid having this flaw in my shots, but his camera is about the same age and it also has this problem. I called Canon to see what it might be, and it turns out that it is something wrong with the CCD and prism system. The Part is $500.00 and the labor starts at $400.00. In other words, its is not worth fixing. So I consider the GL2 a throw away piece of junk after about a year and a half."
1,Undependable,"I bought GL-2 camera for my business. I had it less than a month before I started having problems with it. The camera would not rewind or fast forward. Also the image has a mosaic half the time I tried to replay the tape.I kept calling Canon repair service. I always had to wait on hold for a minimum of 20 minutes. (No toll free call to the repair center)I had used a small Digital Sony camera for the past 3 years. NEVER had a problem with it.Canon would not replace my camera. They wouldn't send me a loaner. etc.My camera has been in the shop somewhere in New Jersey for over two weeks. It's June, and weddings are abundant, I've had to resort back to my ole Sony cameras.I am very disappointed with Canon and will never buy another Canon again."
1,GL2 sucks and Amazon sucks more...,"Within the first 30 days GL2 began eating my tapes. I promptly returned camera to Amazon within the first 30 days. 30 days after receipt of the product by Matt Greene at Amazon, still no refund. After 3 calls to their customer service, taken by people in the Philipines, still no refund. Will NEVER buy Canon or from Amazon again. Amazon, get your act together, this is not the economy to be messing with people's money. Plus, you might reconsider using people in a foreign company who have no concern for YOUR customers. They promised to call back twice, never did either time."
5,A Classic from two of Jazz Music's Imortals,"WOW! My first impression when I heard the CD was pure pleasure. Gone with the old scratchy vinyl lp and on with the digital version. For Jazz lovers and musicologists, this CD represents the meeting of two of the most influential musicians of the 2oth Century. For those who simply love to hear Jazz when played by the best, well you will be hard pressed to find it played better. Louis Armstrong's All-Stars (along with Duke on piano) play for the sure pleasure of it and it comes across."
5,The Names Speak for themselves,"Thanks to My Grandparents I Got Exposed To these Great Minds.having Listened to these Great Minds at an Early Age was Magic To My Ears&Heart.When you can Bring these Two Great Minds Together on Record it's s a Must.these Two Great Artists have so Much Depth,Texture&Range in the Material they Make.The Musicianship is High Quality."
5,Now You Finally Get The Whole Enchilada.,"Without question Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong are the two most important figures in 20th century American music. Here they're joined together for a historic session, performing a solid set of Ellingtonian chestnuts. The sheer joy of these seminal figures playing together for the first and only time reaches out and grabs you. If listening to Satchmo sing Duke's Place or Don't Get Around Much Anymore doesn't get to you, then call the undertaker, cause you died sometime ago."
5,Legends of Swing,"Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, 17 songs, all for a stupidly cheap price. If you don't buy this album, there's something wrong with you!"
2,Fartz inJustice,OK Album....Sounds like more of The Accused.I like the older Fartz stuff better.....more old skool punk sounding.
5,I can't believe it!,"I've been on a C.O.C. binge lately. I drug out the old cassete tapes and decided to look for them on disc. It's a shame I can only find ""animosity"" on cd, It's probably their best recording but ""Eye For An Eye"" is just classic. It's the pre thrash, hardcore punk masterpiece that paved the way for DRI and all those other bands that had such an impact in the early 80's. C.O.C. was just that, dirty. I've sen them in 90's and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Old C.O.C. is something original, If you can get it, get it!"
2,This is a lifetime movie in manga form.,This perverted little girl named Yagami keeps throwing herself at Godai throughout the story. It reminds me of several lifetime movies and literally made me want to tear the book in pieces. Shes crazy.
1,DVD content minimal,"Imagine buying skiis/snowboards and asking what you might do to keeo them in shape. Then imagine a brief conversation in the back room of a ski shop...sort of a ""well, dude this is what I do..."" that's all this video provides. The Tuning kit hasn't arrived yet, one can only hope that ""it"" is worth $19."
2,Tune-up ski video,For the price I was disappointed with the dvd. It is too short. Just shot in some store . Did not answer too many of my tuning questions. Good for really basic basic tuning.
2,DVD,"not that much information I found in this DVD, you can find more free movie about ski tune up on youtub."
4,An Early Diamond,"This is a great heavy metal album whcih easily demonstrates the band's distintive melodies, vocals and superb guitar work. Take Hall of the Mountain King and Gutter and throw in Power of The Night and you have got Sirens in my opinion. I have this feeling that if you are a big Dio fan you will love this album. The only slight downer is the drum sound but it is only a slight quibble, it is an old recording!"
1,Almost scared me to death,"When my doctor discovered cysts on my ovary, she wanted to do a hysterectomy. I bought this book to get information on hysterectomies, and subsequently refused to have the hysterectomy. Finally, after my doctor used the word ""cancer,"" I agreed to the removal of the cyst only. It was stage 1C ovarian cancer. I then had a hysterectomy which saved my life. Listen to your doctor who knows you! I am 10 months post-hysterectomy, and I am doing great--and, most importantly, I am alive."
3,Scary or Helpful?,"This book seems to have a lot of good information for women who may be facing a choice about hysterectomy. It also attempts to scare women out of having the operation. I'm not knowledgeable enough to judge the author's medical scholarship, but I did notice some poor editing (spelling and word usage errors).I would be interested to know what doctors think about this book!"
2,Tries to scare women,"I just checked this book out of the library and could not finish it. I'm considering hysterectomy this summer due to years of suffering, and this book just made me angry. This author's experience with her surgery is not the norm, but she tries to make women think that it is. It is unnecessarily frightening to women who are deciding about having a hysterectomy. I don't recommend it at all."
1,Could be better,It does not sound good and if you move it the music fuzzes. But if you want a cheap headphone splitter this is the one to get it was good for the price
2,Quality Poor,This product does it's job at a significant cost of quality. The sound is extremely soft when split between two headphones. I would go for a higher quality one if I were to buy a splitter again.
4,"good, just hard to get any jack into it","good, just hard to get any jack into it, however they still are working with no problems so far to date."
2,Headphone Splitter,"This item came on a timely fashion, but broke the covering around the cable broke within a day. I was able to fix it, but disappointed that it broke so quickly."
3,if you read this,fast delivery but did not work properly one side only makes one side of headphones sound the other side works just fine and it was really cheap so we get what we pay for
3,STRANGE SPLITING RESULT BUT OKAY IN GENERAL,"When you plug your headphones into it halfway without securing the plug into it completely (without securing it at all,) you get normal sound quality, but only in one ear. When you plug the plug in all the way, you get very strange sound in both ears. Okay for their purpose though, as long as you can hold the headphone plug into it a certain way."
3,one side short out at times,sometime one side of the headphone does not play...you can wiggle the white jack and it will play until you move it
4,It works,"This headphone splitter works. Beyond that, I don't really know what more can be said. It's cheap, too, which is nice. All around good headphone splitter, if you ask me."
2,not in stereo,"I did not think the wires or construction were too thin or inappropriate. However, overall rating only 2 stars because it is not a stereo plug! Maybe mine was defective, but this splitter mixed the right and left audio signals. Not what I expect for a splitter advertised to use with an iPod, in my opinion."
1,Sound quality is awful,"I purchased this splitter because it was so inexpensive, but this is truly a case of ""you get what you pay for"". The sound quality is so awful it is unusable. I will spend a little more money next time around to get something that actually works."
1,"Super cheap, but I basically just threw a few bucks away.","I don't even know if I got what I paid for with this item. It's hit or miss whether it works or not, and it is very difficult to unplug your headphones from it after using it."
2,I made it through!,"It was quite an accomplishment to make it through all of Harrison's puffery to get to the end. I don't think it was worth it. There are some really good sections including one on road trips as a way to break out of the duldrums and of course getting out into the woods - I loved his idea of finding ""thickets"" in which to escape and get back to normal. I can relate.I'm a huge Harrison fan and love Sundog, Farmer, and Legends of the Fall the best. I just don't get much enjoyment out of is name dropping and arrogant attitude. He mentions his wife and family rarely and there's just a couple references about his writing and approach. I get the feeling he wrote this pretty fast and a couple chapters seem like stand-alone essays that were thrown in. This book could have used some good editing/pruning.That said, Harrison is still tied for my favorite author and his books are prominent on my bookshelf."
4,What a life!,I have always been a fan of Jim Harrison. His autobiography is even more interesting than some of his novels. I can now see that he puts himself in most of his stories; you just have to read between the lines to understand and see this.The man has paid his dues and yet lived a wonderful life in ways many of us can only dream of.
2,Not What Was Expected,"Being originally from the Osceola/Reed City area I was pleased with the descriptiveness of his youth and the opening of the story. However, the book began to sink into tedious introspection and then sank further into compulsive loutism and unregreted debouchery.The book is a tribute to the wife,daughter and secretary who stuck by the author who should have grown up and not continued to revel in such decadence. He lived much of his life as a wastrel. Too bad, I suspect the author has a real talent, but has wasted much of his life and our time."
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"This movie is BORING and TERRIBLE.....lacking in action, poor acting and terrible movie overall. I wasted my time and money ......DONOT BUY THIS MOVIE."
3,Ok B movies,"The land that time forgot, a remake from an other movie. Its ok B movie. Graphics was good, acting ok. Its a B movie, its still fun to watch."
1,"Slow, Plodding, But Respectful and Beautiful","""Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls"" is slow in all respects. It is has the feel of a historical documentary. The finale is a bit of an anti-climax and lacks a big-budget punch.However, the scenery is filmed on or near the locations mentioned in the H. Rider Haggard book. The tribesmen (if that is not an offensive term) are real South Africans who live in a village that caters to tourists. The spoken non-English language is apparently genuine and not some Hollywood mumbo-jumbo. The ""Making of"" and other features, while short, almost make this a two-star movie.Viewed from a ""we-have-two-weeks-to-make-a-movie"" perspective, the movie works. However, the budget and time limitations reduce the movie to a one-star movie. So much potential was not realized."
4,Allan's Quarter,"This is my first exploration into the fictional realm of Allan Quartermain. I found it interesting, though the story line was a little disjointed at times. I enjoyed the period and location of the story and the action. I will look for more Allan Quartermain adventures because of this introduction to him."
3,"Well,Its Almost HARRISON FORD...And AFRICA is reel !","ALLAN QUATERMAIN: TEMPLE OF SKULLSTheasylum.ccAQ:TOS has a look, Because there aren't any stars this film has a MORE real feel.Okay the lead actor does have a slight resemblance to Harrison Ford, But that's not a bad thing.The music throughout is really good and perfectly suited for each scene.The villain has a Angus Scrimm/Boris Karloff look that works very well.Actually filmed in AFRICA by Mark Atkins, We believe his first time directing, Although he is Theasylum Director Of Photography to go to.Two closing points:Theasylum has gotten away from nudity to enhance its sales to Sci-Fi Channel and THEN Allan Quatermain comes along with its National Geographic school of Hotties.That Damned `Beheading Claw', This reminded me fondly of `The Flying Gullotine' of my filmic youth."
3,Not a bad movie,"What's wrong with you people ?It seems you're reviewing a major blockbuster. It's an Asylum film for C....t's sake. I've watched a few of those, they're not good but they don't pretend to be either; and I must say that this is probably the best one of the lot.Don't try to watch it thinking it is an Indiana Jones rip off or an Allan Quatermain film but watch it thinking it is an Asylum film and you might be surprised with what they did with the limited budget and the limited time.The plot has major faults (of course), there's no Temple of Skulls but to me it makes a lot more sense than the Sherlock Holmes film by the Asylum with the dinosaurs.It's not the best movie you'll see but it's definitely not the worst movie you'll ever watch."
2,Nothing original.,"This is another adaptation of the original story ""King Solomon's Mines"". The fifth that I am aware of, and the seventh film to feature the Allan Quartermain character. So if you are expecting a new adventure, as the title suggests, you will probably be disappointed. As I certainly was. I dont think its as dreadful as the rest of the reviews on here. I did enjoy it. Its a very modest adaptation and does contain a few twists on the original concept that I, surprisingly, didn't mind. Its budget is certainly modest. I am shocked that The Asylum would fit the bill to film in Africa and I dont think it was even necessary. Thats money that might have gone into some better sets or more action. It sort of made me think of what a 1980s BBC version might have been like."
4,Excellent on pronunciation of the words given.,"I bought this book and it came with a cassette tape. I found it to be extremely good in the pronunciation of the words that are given in the book. It is not a dictionary or a words manual, it is a book that tries to give a sound basic working knowledge of the most commonly used spanish phrases and words to people who speak english. But I have found it exceptional for pronunciation. It gives you a real understanding of the way words should sound and pronounced. The tape also gives the pronunciation and sound of the words. Excellent. Radcliffe."
5,Spanish CD's ( made from old cassettes ),"The product arrived in good shape and was as described. The included text was in excellent shape and the CD's were virtually unused. The recordings themselves were probably originally done over 25 years ago, maybe 40, judging from the content ( telephone booth, razor blades, etc.) but still quite useful. I am totally satisfied with product and service."
4,"Everyone's perennial favorites, GWAR, have done it again","As always, the people of GWAR have brought you the most offensive and delightful grouping of melodies available. X-cops is a must buy for anyone who loves GWAR. The new guy that is Beefcake the Mighty sings most of the vocals as sherrif Tubb Tucker and is pretty good (Not as good as Dave Brockie, but still pretty good). Highlights include Cavity Search, Zipper Pig, Cobb Knobbler (Dave Brockie on vocals), and Paddy Wagon Rape. This album is great, the live show is great, X-Cops is great."
4,a must for any GWAR fan,"Good fun with plenty of nasty, vulgar, sexually suggestive songs to please any real GWAR fan."
5,I need to defend them against lame reviews.......,"This is one of the greatest recent bands.............no room to argue, there has been so much hype over them it speaks for itself. any band that can have a debut this awesome is truly worth listening to. I can't %&$#@!% wait for their next album. I have to disagree to those who liken them to Franz, both are kick @$$ bands, but each have their own sound. I've seen the Killers and Franz in concert, both were great, but I loved the killers. lead singer Brandon had a great stage prescence, and they just really put on an awesome show. There is not a single song on this album that lacks."
5,These guys are killer,"So i know what your thinking. Im gonna buy this CD, and the only good song will be somebody told me, and im half sick of that from being all over MTV. Well... the other songs are fan fricken tastic also. I honestly don't skip any of the songs. I do have my favorites though. Track 1 AMAZING. 10/10. Track 3,4,5,6 i give a 9.5/10 Track 7 10/10 track 8 10/10. Track 9 9/10 Track 10 so good. This CD will be in your stereo for a week, at least. Go pick it up while its new and on sale everywhere. Cause you'll end up buying it anyways. Its just to catchy to resist."
5,Great Album,"THis album is awesome!!!!!!i got this cd for an amazing price of 6.99 at Best Buys.Go get yours now.Every song on it is great and very catchyIf u like the singles ""somebody told me"" or ""mr.brightside"",get this album. The rest of the songs are just as good.You won't be dissapointed"
1,SOMEBODY TOLD ME ... this CD is gay,"Wow, are these some of the stupidest lyrics that I have ever heard. Take away the vocals and all that is left are boring, bland, unimaginative songs. Terrible songwriting. There are so many better new rock bands out there that do it right - why does this crap get so much airplay?I hear these guys a lot on radio stations that claim to be ""modern rock"". If this is the future of rock music then I'm turning to rap."
2,"Pirate like you mean it, if anything at all.","When I first heard The Killers' single ""Somebody Told Me"" on their website months before their debut album was released, I was really blown away. It was cheesy, it was catchy, it was good. Which, in the long run, was really unfortunate. The Killers chose to pack this album at the top, and let the crap sink to the bottom really obviously. The result is only an EP's worth of songs that get tiring after a while, and make a band with potential easily forgettable. Don't believe the hype on this album."
1,Piece of crap,Rediculous piece of crap designed for idiots. The Killers is so vacant of any musical talent one with any music appreciation wonders what the hell is wrong with people.
5,Hot fuss is Hot stuff !!!,"well .... i just got this cd yesterday ... so infatuated with ""somebody told me"" i knew that this cd was going to be something i was going to cherish and i was right ... lately i have been buying albums from artists i'm just disliking .. destinys child's destiny fulfilled to ryan cabrera's take it away .. its been a while since i bought an album and gave it 5 stars ... in hot fuss there's a little of everything to enjoy .. from harmonies that just will live in ur head forever to words that truly mean something ... over all congradulations to the band for the grammy nominations ... and hope to see more from the killers ...."
4,Annoying but good....,This music is annoying as hell but its good as hell at the same time. I like it but if you listen to it too much it will give you a headache. I would suggest getting it.
5,GREAT,"Every song on this album is great, if you give them all a chance thier great. I love these guys."
1,Heard that one before,A friend recommended that I should get their CD because they rock! So I did. Boy were they wrong!!! These guys suck big time. Just another cookie cutter pop/rock (boring) band of today. I will never buy a CD of these guys ever again and I will never listen to my ex-friend!!
1,Why must you people incourage these guys?!?,"Lately, everything coming from artists these days are crap (this crap, American Idiot, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, The Massacre etc.). The biggest problem was that each of these artists are being played everywher, and that really, really sucks. This Group has probably taken the cake, though. These guys are sad, pathetic and sad-pathetic-peices-of-crap. Mr. Brightside is the only one i'm even going to talk about, as too much talk of The Killers make me want to hurl. You have no doubt heard Mr. Brightside at least once and i don't need to tell you its sad, sad crap. thats really all i have to say, and its more than these losers deserve to have said about them. luckily, unlike all the CDs mentioned above, i didn't waste my money on them, because i borrewed this sad excuse of an album from a friend. (...)Thanks for reading and hopefully listening,Kid"
2,"good sound, poor songs","the killers have a rad sound but this album does not live up to the hype. The songs seem to be teen punk power pop wrapped in a New Order sound. I've heard it many times over. Listen to Joy Division or The Strokes instead. Way better tunes, and original. Hopefully on the next Lp The Killers find their own sound."
5,They won't get off the radio anytime soon,"First single I heard from them was ""Somebody told me"" and it wasenough to be hooked. After listening to the entire album severaltimes over again you can't help but notice a dash of ""The Cure""in there. If you have just heard the single, you have not heard the best song on this album. I haven't found a ""filler"" track on the album. Every song has a story and the lyrics are catchy. I don't know how long they will be able to call themselves ""indie""but who cares if you like good music?"
3,not quite there,"When I heard ""Somebody Told Me"", I was quite excited particularly by the fact that this is a well written song with a catchy hook. When I bought this CD, I really wanted to be blown away because it happens so infrequently with music these days (unlike the 80's that was full of awesome college radio), but I wasn't. My sense of this band is they have strong song writing components with the possibility to make really great melodic pop music, but as a whole it just isn't quite there. I feel there is undeveloped work here with the exception of a few songs. I also think the lyrics are a bit weak- even for an 80's influenced band. I hope with future albums this band develops to its full potential. I am really looking forward to see what they do next."
3,"Uprising, Good, but needs polishing..","The title says basically what my review will echo.. The Killers show great promise with the debut work. When their songs are good on here, they are awesome and deserve a 5, yet some of the songs are a little crude and struggle to stay consistent with the top songs.. I try to wait for a group to have a sophmore album to see where they are headed and where they came from before making my mind up about a group.. So check out my review of Sams Town to see what I meant. As for Hot Fuss, it deserves a 3 and a half, but definitely not a 4.. I dont think its fair to even give them bonus points for creating other groups that sound similar.. The Killers are a good group, and their first album was above par and worthy of being bought if only to warm you up for Sams Town.. Enjoy!"
4,sweeeeeeeeeet,"Probally the best album of 2005.The songs ""somebody told me"" and ""Mr brightside"" tie the whole album together. All the other songs are great, but those two songs are my favorite. A great sounding cd as well! For any IPOD owner definitely a must to add to your play-list, as the IPOD sound really showcases the vocals and rock'n sound! If you ask me, there one of the top 10 rock bands of 2005. You need to buy Hot fuss, a no brainer for anyone looking for an awesome gift or an excellent rock experience."
3,Pretty Good,"Here's a breakdown of the songs:Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine-I don't really dig songs with people's names in them but this is passable.4/5Mr. Brightside-The second single from the band and the story of my life. I really like it but the synthesizers can get annoying.4/5Smile Like You Mean It-Lyrically, one of the best songs on the album. The message is a bit sad.5/5Somebody Told Me-I never felt for this one much. Kinda boring except for the ending parts.3/5All These Things That I've Done -Good song, bad choice to make it a single. There's a gospel choir in the background that's totally awesome.4/5Andy, You're A Star-Never liked it. Pretty lame.1/5On Top-Reminds me of the eighties. The synths really rock out on this one (can synths rock out?) The chorus is a hook.5/5Change Your Mind-Again, I've failed to play this song more than once.1/5Believe Me Natalie-Love it. Great vocals.5/5Midnight Show-Um...1/5Everything Will Be Alright-Perfect close to an album. Slow and soothing.5/5"
3,Killers - Hot Fuss,"This re-release could have been so much better, it could have included lots more bsides on than it has,the why dont you find out for youself cover, who let you go, the many remixes of mr brightside and somebody told me, show you how and the super rare waiting for love, which could have been a massive double disc release.That would have made it truly special, but this is a re-release of the japanese released album, which isnt even as good as the japanese release, as that was released with the 3 bonus tracks and with a seperate dvd with 3 video's of the singles!Superb album though, anyone who doesnt own it already ...well just go buy it and see what your missing."
5,killer album,"Im not going to bore you with how they sound like duran duran and new order and the cure, and other new wave acts oops I just did."
5,My Favorite Band!,"I bought the CD after seeing the music videos for ""Mister Brightside"", ""All These Thing's I've Done"", and ""Somebody Told Me"", and I am *so* glad. I've listened to it ten times. The lyrics are really intriguing, and the music is catchy. I absolutely *love* it!!! It's completely worth the multiple exclamation points.(Just a side note: some people have mentioned that it's unoriginal. I couldn't DISagree more, but I don't have a very large music collection and don't really know enough about the genre to have a valid opinion.)"
5,loser! they do NOT suck!,"i like the original sound, the unique voice, etc. it is not utter rubish, my friend. YOU ARE. a-hem; anyways, the songs have an intriging, catchy tune that intriques you to conyinue to listen. my faveroites are sombody told me, mr. brightside, and smile like you mean it. oh, yeah. if you don't take me seiriosly 'cuase i'm a kid, i won't listen to YOU 'cause i don't like you any more! ah, well, that aside."
5,Starving for something this good,"It's amusing to read other reviewers on here saying ""calm down, they aren't that good"". What a passion-less soul you must be! Clean out your ears or close your eyes because yes...The Killers are the best thing I've heard in ages. I only recently got my hands on both Hot Fuss and Sam's Town and it was amazing to (finally!) find two albums I could actually listen to from start to finish. My favorite tracks are ""All these things that I've done"", ""Jenny was a friend of mine"", ""Mr. Brightside"", ""Change Your Mind""."
3,The Cure Light,"If you liked or grew up with some of that old 80s stuff like the Cure or the Smiths you'll probably like this. Musically it's lighter, not quite as emotionally rich or heartfelt or experimental (who could forget the Cure's Head on the Door)...sort of like some protected middle class kids grew up listening to big bro's old vinyl...but it's well crafted and innovative enough not to miss."
4,Original...,"Though you can find bits and pieces of the 80s, Bowe, The Beatles, and Queen in the music--it is orginal by today's standards. The first time I listened to this Cd was similar to the first time I listened to ""Elephunt"" by The White Stripes--I knew I had struck gold. ""All these things that I've done"" sent chills up my spine. The song is truly refreshing. In a VERY boring time in music, this was a breath of fresh air. If you happen to be a brit-rock, Jet, or White Stripes fan or you're just sick manufactured music...you must own this CD."
4,Great debut...,"Worth a try. Many of the songs remind me of the music I used to listen to in middle and high school in the 80's. The first four tracks are highly recommended. If you like them, I'd also seek out these groups: The Atari's and All American Rejects. Not bad- also I hope they win at least a Grammy for Best New Artist."
4,I'm hooked,"I admit that I'm a sucker for all things 80s. So with many bands now with an 80s sound, I'm intrigued.I was first introduced to The Killers while driving, and ""Somebody Told Me"" came on the radio. I was a little unsure at first, but by the time the song was over, I was hooked.""Hot Fuss"" is a nice debut. It's a great album to listen to while driving down the road. It's not always the most original sounding, but it does stand out from the crowd. I could see The Killers getting better with experience. They are definitely a band to keep your eye, and ear, on.I highly recommend this album as one of the best debuts of 2004."
4,Worth the Fuss,"The Killers are what rock has been waiting for with a fusion of punk and electro influences they've made the genre sound fresh and this album is the proof.With no fillers, just catchy bouncing riffs and memorable lyrics this is the best album of the past few years in my opinion, with 'Mr Brightside' being in my top ten greataest tracks ever.If you want an album of anthematic rock pop to air guitar around your house to then this is it."
3,"Not bad, for the first 5 songs...","This ablum is great... for the first 5 songs. You know them, you love them, they are all hit singles. Too bad the next 6 haven't managed to squeak there way into my rotation yet. I find my self clicking next next next through them. This would make a great tape back in the day, I would have called it a one sider... with the second side never seeing the light of day. But the songs for which you are likely looking at this CD for were enough to convince me to buy it, rather than hope for a one day greatest hits compilation."
3,Fun Rock,"This CD brings good lyrics and Fun Sound ! I love that !It`s called : "" Pure Rock "", Rock & Roll.Best track : Mr. Brightside"
3,"Fun, but not exactly fully satisfying.","Don't get me wrong, this is a good debut and a fun cd. I bought this cd for Mr. Brightside. Not really my genre, so perhaps it deserves more than three stars. To those who love this cd, maybe I just need to listen to it more?"
3,My first Killers CD,"My first exposure to the Killers was through the song ""All These Things I've Done,"" which is probably the most perfect song I've heard in a long time. From the single, sign-of-life piano key at the beginning of the song to the pulsing drums at the end, the music and lyrics of ""All These Things I've Done"" inspire me to dream. Weird how a song can do that. The rest of the album is good, with lots of synthesizers and heavy guitar. There's one song where I could swear I'm listening to The Smiths, or at the very least, Morrissey. Overall, a great addition to any music collection that is rock-n-roll heavy. Enjoy."
3,soud quality,"I love their music and their songs but the sound quality on the CD was horrible, i have hear illegal copies of their songs on youtube that were a better quality, they should re-reaslse the CD with a better sound quality for a lower price then the original."
4,smile like you mean it,"There are 3 great songs on this album. The rest are not bad (mostly filler) but I would absolutely buy this for ""somebody told me,"" ""mr. brightside,"" and especially ""smile like you mean it."" The synth pop rock of the last song reminds me of the 80's and i must admit that i can put the song on repeat and fall asleep to it and then listen to it for hours the next day and then again in my car if i go somewhere. the songs are very simple. . . they write one verse and a hook and repeat -- few artists have the production to get away with that sort of thing.I also appreciate the gospel choir in ""all these things that i've done."" It's the kinda thing you hear in the Kanye West tracks that aren't singles. Not as much to the liking of mainstream opinion but good music nonetheless."
3,Monotone,"I will admit, The Killers have some catchy songs off of the album, but after awhile all of the songs start to sound the same... the same slow beat with the emphasis of the voice synthesizer. Also, I find that Brandon Flowers has trouble varying his voice. All of the songs are him talking fast over a synthesizer. I think that the album would be better more varied and with different arrangements of instruments. Finally, the lyrics are original, but are a bit repetative. I guess the album's okay overall."
4,Awesome Debut,"The Killers stand out to me as one of the best new bands around with this ""turn it up"" debut. The opening tracks will have you jamming without even realizing it. The infectious ""Mr. Brightside"" isn't quite as good to me now that it's getting so much radio play, but the song is definitely worthy of the airtime. Every song is a good one--this CD has been a part of my regular rotation since I bought it 2 months ago. My only complaint is that the album mellows out as it progresses and the later tracks aren't quite as ""rock and roll"", though definitely still good. Absolutely worth buying--I can't wait for the next one!"
4,Good Debut,"The Killers are one of the new era of rock bands (Franz Ferdinand, Snow Patrol, Muse, Libertines, The Zutons) that are taking over the music industry by storm and replacing the all that crap Rap and Pop we have to listen to now.When I first heard them I mistook them for a British band due to the leader singer having a strong British Accent.As a strong Oasis fan I have to say, they are not as good as Oasis in their Hayday( Whats the story morning glory, time), but their showing signs of the same vigour and style of music that Oasis once had.Overall I have to say the album's not bad. The first 5 songs are really good, but apart from ""On Top"" the others fail to impress. However I have to say that it is an Album worth buying, and I hope they keep producing music as good in the future and one day they might eclipse Oasis in the music industry (Highly Unlikely)."
4,Britpop lives on,Could these guys please send back the Shed Seven albums!I just wonder whether Rick Witter feels flattered or annoyed.
4,"Great Rock, Sometimes","This album is truly hit of miss. Some of the songs - like the first Single ""Somebody Told Me"" - have what seems like infinite replayability. The first half of the album is like that. From there, though, The Killers falter - like they used up all their A material on the first few tracks and REALLY wished that they were releasing on vinel, so at least people would know the rest was their ""B side"".All in all though, the album is worth a listen. I would suggest you buy the tracks you like on iTunes - $10 isn't worth four or five good songs."
2,Too experimental for me,"The first I'd heard of The Killers (like most people's first experience with them) was ""Somebody Told Me"". I absolutely loved this song. Then along came ""Mr. Brightside""; another good song. So, I took a chance figuring that the rest of the CD would sound similar. I was very wrong. Their sound leans more toward the synthesizer than the guitar. The two songs I previously mentioned are really the only two which have the guitar-driven melody and catchy chorus. Most of the songs seem to plod along. I kept saying to myself ""is this song over yet?"" If you like Franz Ferdinand, then you will probably like this CD. I was expecting something more along the lines of The Used. As for me, I'll be pawning my copy of this album (after I burn the two songs I like)."
3,good album.... best song is distorted!!,"I really like this album... but the song ""Mr Bightside"" (which is why I bought the album)was recorded improperly. Whoever recorded/engineered ""Mr. Brightside"" pushed the recording levels too loud, and therefore it distorts a few times.... I have tried listening on several systems, and it just sounds like crap when you crank it up...The rest of the album doesn't seem to have the same problem...oh well"
3,Pretty good,"I got turned onto the Killers by a Buddy of mine&I like there vibe. they remind of Depache Mode,The Cure&the Smiths in spots. I like how they blend there influences with there vibe. they are welcome to the scene of now. not a bad Album&it will take you back a bit with the production&Directions the Albums goes into."
5,Cd rocks,"I love this cd its awesome mr.brightside, somebody told me , on top, smile like you mean it and midnight show are my favorites best cd.Great new band very good for a new cd THE killers rule."
4,Will Get You Moving,"there are a lot of people out there who feel The Killers aren't true ""indie rock."" True, they may sound pretty polished, but this album is great whatever you consider it! I lived in a cave until December of 2004 when I was told about ""Somebody Told Me."" I seriously swear I was the last person in the country to hear it! However, going off the recommendations I just decided to buy the cd. Excellent idea! It's a good mix of mellow and music to get you pumped up. and if you are going out and need a little juice to get you ready, I highly recommend ""Midnight Show."" Total high energy!"
4,solid album,Like most of the great music i have found lately...i first heard them on The OC when mix 2 first came out. Then they played live on the show and i realized how great they were. This is a good album with my favorite song being smile like you mean it.
5,Love em,I saw the killers live a couple of days ago and i went out and bought the cd and was blown away by the talent. I saw them on the oc the other night and they were awesome. I love them!
5,Portugal did not know this fellows,"Just buy this record, for sure you will have a better day, after hearing. every morning, a great therapyPuts you high"
4,Best Killers Album,"Love the Killers and this is probably their best album. First few songs are definitely the best, especially Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, Mr Brightside, Somebody Told Me, and All These Things I've Done (my favorite Killers song...first time I heard it I fell in love with them...) They remind me of a cross between David Bowie, The Cure and Duran Duran--weird combination (kind of) but my favorite bands when I was a teenager."
3,This sounds like I've heard it before....,"On their debut album ""Hot Fuss"" the instant thought that entered my head was ""this sounds really familiar"". I wouldn't pronounce this CD garbage, because it's fairly decent with it's mix of 80's twist of modern music. On the other hand, the group familiarize themselves as Rooney, Franz Ferdinand, and even a little of Modest Mouse. It's key to have independence among the music now, especially broading category of ""rock"" because I've heard it. Give me difference, and something unique!The CD captures catchy tunes like ""On Top"", ""Andy, Your a Star"", and so forth. It's a great CD, and yet can be highly annoying after the first few songs.Give it a shot, maybe you'll find a sense of ""ear candy"" among the tracks somewhere between the lines."
4,Excellent listen,"Bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. In addition to the songs we've heard on the radio, we thoroughly enjoy the deeper cuts."
4,Pop Rock Mastery,"This has to be one of the most honest pop rock cd's I've listened to, ever. Most pop music seems fake and over-elaborated, this sounds fresh and real. This album is a real treat, I would recommend it 100%. Midnite show and Smile like you mean it are my favorites. there is a lot of contrast, kinda like somber or dark lyrics with upbeat tempos. I dig it. I gave it four stars because there are only two or three songs that I just don't seem to get in to them at all."
4,Viva La Glam Rock!,"Finally, a new band with talent, charisma and a great beat that you can dance to. The Killers have been influenced by the best -T-Rex, Camouflage, Blondie, Depeche Mode. ""Somebody Told Me"" will remind you of Blur's ""Girls and Boys."" But the music is fresh, modern and very distinct from the over-produced top 40 non-variety that spills from the radio today. The lead singer has fantastic stage presence and an intensity that commands the audience. I hope this band reaches the success it deserves and that there is more to come."
1,GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!,are you people retarded? why do you listen to this crap? it's just fabricated 80's music. utter crap.ugh...ugh...ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Horrible,"I havent even heard this album yet, the 2 songs I have heard on tv have sucked, I mean they are bad, really bad, this band is just another example of how bad music is today, I mean look at the music of today, Frenz Fernidad or whatever they're called, modest mouse...I mean come on, wheres the talent? I would never get this album ever, but the good news is that Rock is on its way back! all these great bands from back in the 80's are all coming back and are gonna blow this crap away. I recommened L.A.Guns-Tales from the strip or Buckcherry's new and upcoming album ""15"""
1,Interesting...,... that the only thing different on this version and the original US version is ONE SONG. Glamourous Indie Rock & Roll replaced Change Your Mind. That's all.
1,Underworld Pooped...,"alright, so if i could give this crap ZERO stars i would. true, true, i haven't heard the whole album, but what i have heard makes my teeth hurt. for the sake of my future children, the only song i've heard on what i'm sure is an otherwise unremarkable album is the train wreck known as ""mr. brightside."" this song is a BLATANT RIP-OFF OF UNDERWORLD!!! i'm not the biggest underworld fan to have walked the face of the earth, and i probably wouldn't have ever heard of / cared about the killers otherwise, but it's still wrong to COPY / MIMIC / STEAL another band's sound just because you're too lame to think of anything on your own and you know it will get some quick attention. shame, shame, killers... i've already forgotten your name."
1,AURALLY PENETRATED AGAINST MY WILL,"I was first aurally penetrated by this incredibly tedious band the other night on Saturday Night Live. I couldn't believe how uninteresting their lyrics were and how lame the bedazzeled keyboards were. To be honest, if you're going to wear such form-fitting clothes you should at least work out a little bit. These guys looks like they're flat-chested going to slight pudge. At least now they can afford propetia.1 more year and they're going on the 'who were they?' rack. I've already seen this record in the cut-out bins and what used record store isn't complete with this record for about $5.99?Needless to say, I'd rather listen to the latest Norah Jones LP than this collection of crap. Shame on Island records for trying to cash in on the ""rock revival"" thing with this piece of crap."
1,This friggin sucks,"These dipsticks are so into makin their video all fancy they don't stop to think about the one thing in music that is truly important...TALENT. Although, that truly doesn't matter today because people will buy anything as long as it's on MTV. This has to be the worst thing I've heard in years, and I predict these guys will go out of style quicker than you can say Hanson or Spice Girls. Yeah, I said it, bite me. Forget listenin to the ""popular"" stuff such as this, most of it's absolute garbage.I think if you look of the word popular in the dictionary of MTV and VH1 it simply means HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW. Don't be part of a fad you'll look back on in 5 years and have to kick your own @$$ for."
1,eww,"""Secondly, at least give these boys a chance. Obviously somebody likes them if they are getting airplay on the radio."" is what a previous reviewer said.That is WHY people like them, because they're on the radio. It's more mainstream crap made for the radio just so that they can get fans. Note that the good bands who aren't mainstream crap aren't on the radio....NOFX Rancid Pennywise bet you've never heard of them because you're too busy listening to Green Day and that crap.According to one of the spotlight reviews, this is a knockoff of Blur and The Cars and such. So WHY would you listen to a knockoff instead of the real thing??? Go buy Blur's self titled album and The Cars ""Panorama"" if you want REAL music of this style.Have fun giving these guys your money and giving them fame you don't deserve. Or take my advice and listen to bands who need your help and are deserving of it."
1,Lack of Creativty,"Marketing rules the musical world. This album is a nice example.But don't take too much attention on it, in one year every body will forget this loosy album."
5,The Killers Rock!,"The reviews saying that the Killers will fade out quicker than Hanson and the Spice Girls was ridiculous. And just because they're on MTV and VH1 doesn't mean that they're going to quickly fade out b/c they have no talent. IT MEANS THEY'RE GOOD! And btw, EVERYONE KNOWS THE SPICE GIRLS! They certainly left an impression. The Killers are a great band, and their sound is different than most other songs that are played on the radio 2day, that all sound the same. They have great vocals, good and sometimes funny lyrics, and awesome original songs. It is hard to pick a favorite song on this cd, because each one is so great. This is probably my favorite band, and if you buy the cd you will NOT be disappointed. If you don't like the songs at first (i didn't, they took some getting used to) just listen to them again and you might love them like I do. This is a truly awesome cd."
1,Overrated attempt to jump start a dead trend.,"In a quest to find something right with today's radio, I landed upon ""Hot Fuss"" by The Killers.And now, my quest continues.This album is loaded with overrated buzz, horrible lyrics, and ghastly tunes. Just quit it Mr. Flowers, new wave pop is dead, and you're anything but the Re-Animator.Singles for this album such as ""Somebody Told Me"" and ""Mr. Brightside"" are just totally ridiculous. Take for instance, the chorus of ""Somebody Told Me""Well somebody told meYou had a boyfriendWho looked like a girlfriendThat I had in February of last yearIt's not confidentialI've got potentialWHAT? Granted, it's not a mumbo jumbo hunk of lyrics like pretentious prog act The Mars Volta, but still, the lyrics, in any context, are just bad. And the album gets drier and drier as you move on, finally closing with ""Everything Will Be Alright"".Well, trust me, if you listen to this album, perhaps not."
3,"Fairly Good and Catchy, but Not Memorable","I got this CD mostly just for Mr. Brightside. There are a few pretty good songs but some like Andy You're A Star and Everything Will Be Alright ( I like to refer to it as the hangover song, listen and you'll know what I mean) are pretty bad. Most people I know HATE them so watch out. Some lyrics are a little nonsensical like Believe Me Natalie and Somebody Told Me. There are only a couple songs you can like on here at first listen and a couple you'll probably hate and quite a few that will take time to get used to.Recommended- No terribly foul lyrics (though some vague sexual refrences) so....11 OR 12-UpOverall-Pretty good to listen to because of songs like Somebody Told Me and Smile Like You Mean It but this CD isn't for everyone."
5,Welcome back New Wave!!!!!,"This band is a welcome return of the 80s tunes I remember dancing to in the mirror of my room!!! It's reminiscent of an era whose music has fallen to the wayside. When's the last time you heard something on the radio that gets you grooving in your car? Think Molly Ringwald movie soundtrack with this CD. It's a phenomenal tribute to bands like Dead or Alive, YAZ and New Order. Fans who appreciate these other icons will not be disappointed with The Killers."
3,If you find yourself missing The Cure....,"Damn this album is derivative! Is it good music? Yeah, but if you lived through the 80's, you've been here. If you didn't live through the 80's (and you're not just focused on the fact that the frontman is pretty and has a great publicist) buy The Cure's Singles instead."
2,I Dont Know.,"I guess I am getting old. The Smiths,NewOrder,Cure and Talking heads were my music. These bands all sound like watered down versions. Check out the older guys, It was such a great time in music, and dont forget the Clash."
5,Bought it for one track,"I bought this album for the single track ""Indie Rock and Roll"" and it's worth it. I own the US version and it's great as well but I had to have that song.Saw The Killers in concert in Ottawa, Canada and they were great. I'm looking forward to a lot of great albums from this band."
2,A waste of money,"The best songs on this album are the ones you hear on the radio all the time. The rest of the songs sound like bad versions of those songs. You be better off listening to bands like the Cure, the Smith, The Talking Heads, Echo and the Bunnymen or any other good new wave band then this bad imitation."
3,let's not get carried away now,"After listening to this cd, the first thing I thought was, that was pretty good. The synth tones are a little casio, and the fake british accent is kind of lame. There are some great gems on this album, though. It is definitely worth a listen. I hope that they have the opportunity to make another album, because there is definite potential here. The 80's were fine and dandy, but recycling the sound only goes so far. All in all, it's a good album...not a great one."
4,Great record! wo!,"The Killers first album is a success! what a great cd . Along with the smash hit Somebody told me , it has other great tracks with simple strings and serious rocking. If you like a melodic techno rock , this is the cd. for you , hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did."
2,one note wonders,"The product description for Killers' 'Hot Fuss' describes it as'eleven nuggets of reel-you-in storytelling genius'. Come on. With the exception of 'Somebody Told Me', the lead singer runs the gamut of emotions from A to B (to paraphrase Dorothy Parker).'Mr. Brightside' features all of 3 or 4 notes total and banal lyrics that are repeated, in full twice. No melody. Killers wouldn't know a good tune if it bit them in their collective arses."
3,Hot Fuss by The Killers,"The Strokes pioneered it, and recently Franz Ferdinand & others are taking a stab at it; retro, garage rock with staticy vocals. The Killers are actually pretty good at it, and their album Hot Fuss is very good. While they aren't the Strokes, they have proven to be able to create a catchy single that gathers a great deal of interest in the record, in this case it is ""Somebody told Me"". Elsewhere on the album they pull off the formula approx. 75% of the time, especially on highlights like ""Jenny was a Friend of Mine"" & ""Smile Like you Mean It"". My personal favorite track was ""Change Your Mind"". While they won't be contenders for album of the year this year, there is a good chance they may be battling it out in the future."
4,'80s new wave revival,"I got Hot Fuss a couple days ago after only really hearing ""Somebody Told Me"" and then the 30-second clips on amazon. The best way I can describe The Killers is a combination of The Strokes, The Cure, Depeche Mode, and Dead or Alive. As someone below described it, it's danceable pop. If anyone has seen American Psycho, this seems like music that should have been in the club scenes in that movie. All in all, I like the CD because it harkens back to the '80s. Other than ""Somebody Told Me,"" ""Mr. Brightside"" and ""Midnight Show"" are probably the best songs. Other bands I listen to are The Beatles, The Who, and Black Sabbath."
5,Awesome CD,I recently bought this album and i love it. It is a great all around album. It has all kind of songs whether they be fast and upbeat or slower and more mellow. It is a great cd and worth the money you will pay for it.
4,soldiers of glam,"Catchy, electrifying tunes that take the word ""derivative"" to all time highs. This band proudly wears its influences on its sleeves while delivering a fresh sound and brings the energy to new levels. The melodies are hypnotic and the vocalist makes the best of his abilities. They really seem to have striven to be good on every song on this release, which proves refreshing. Their determination was worth it.The work is high energy and pleasantly addictive!"
4,Good CD,"Hot Fuss by The Killers is almost a perfect album. I enjoyed the first 7 tracks more so than the last 4, but overall, the entire album is interesting. A bit overplayed on the radio, but what other popular band isn't? I saw them live, and their show was great too."
4,Pretty Good,"The Killers are pretty good, and this is a pretty good CD- the only problem with it is some of the tracks are just fillers. Best songs are Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, and All These Things I've Done. (if you want to just download them instead of buying)"
4,Love it!,"Very 80s sounding. What I like is that you can understand the words, and that's a big plus nowadays. LOLSeriously, it's a well written and produced album."
4,Definitley Hot.....fuss(?),"Wow...around the time this was out it was all about Greenday and The Killers, I have both albums and they are both great""Hot Fuss"" is catchy pop rock more rock and the songs are extremely catchy. ""Jenny was a friend of mine"" starts the album off on a huge high, and it lets people know this album ISNT gonna suck, then ""Mr.Brightside""kicks in and totally rules the album. It has its downs but mostly this album is on a high. I agree ""somebody told me"" is great but it is totally one of the weakest songs on the album.This is a great album which you guys have to have.Try it out, seriously, I had NO intention of buying this, then I picked it up and it sits greatly in my collectionMust Havehot fuss!"
3,Definately a Cult-Hit,"This CD is very hit or miss. You either like it, or love it. The songs are very different from track to track, but eventually blur to sound very similar and get irritating after a while. Its obvious that this CD is good for two songs; Mr. Brightside and Somebody Told Me, both are great songs, but sound very much like they were covers for 80s songs. They essentially sound like some of the similar European bands, even though I don't think they are European, like Franz Ferdinand. They are great to listen to in the car, but not great for working out or doing other types of activities. This CD adds many different genres together, including Alternative, Rock, Gospel, Indie, and Pop to make a very different sound that most are hearing. Like I said before, you either like this sound, or you don't, but either way, this is a great CD to get if you find it in the bargain bin."
2,Disappointing Repackaging.,"Don't let my rating fool you, I like The Killers and when I bought Hot Fuss shortly after its release I liked the material. However this is a flat out bad ""limited"" edition. We'll have to wait and see if it is truly a product that will only be produced for a short amount of time. With the amount of extra material that The Killers have it is better to just by the extra tracks from itunes(napster, sony connect, etc.) and save yourself the money. The three tracks are good but nowhere near worth rebuying the entire cd. So If you don't already own Hot Fuss then this is a good purchase, however if you already have the cd then don't buy into the band/record label just trying to keep themselves relavent and make more money."
4,80'S ALTERNATIVA AGAIN,"ALONG WITH THE STROKES AND INTERPOL, THIS BAND RECALLS THAT SOUND OF THE LATE 70'S AND EARLY 80'S, SOMETIMES SOUNDING LIKE THE FINE POP ROCK OF DURAN DURAN AND THE ALTERNATIVE OF THOSE POST-PUNK BANDS EMERGING FROM THE DEATH OF 70'S UGLY DISCO. FOR THE PRESENT GENERATION NEW TO THIS MUSIC, I RECOMMEND YOU LISTEN TO BANDS LIKE THE SMITHS, PSYCHODELIC FURS, ECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN, PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED AND OF COURSE THE CURE AND NEW ORDER, AND YOU'LL GET A REALLY GOOD IDEA WHERE THIS GREAT GUITAR AND SYNTH SOUND COMES FROM."
4,"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier","After hearing the single ""Somebody told me"" I wasn't all that impressed with the Killers. I just received the cd for Christmas, and I'm thrilled! Every single song tops their first single, and I have a new found respect for ""Somebody told me"". This cd is great all the way around, and puts a refreshing spin on a few genres of the past. I was thinking of forming a band that combined the sounds of the Cure, Duran Duran, and Depeche Mode, but the Killers beat me to it! Pick this up, and love it."
4,Pretty Good,"The CD has some good songs. As with a lot of CDs, the songs grow on you after a while. Part of the group's appeal is the retro sound. They sound like they are from the 80s, which is good. A lot of the current music and music from the 90s is not that great and sounds the same. A lot of the songs have a haunting, melancholy sound that is pleasent to listen to and does not grate on your nerves."
5,Heaven IS close in a place like this!,"""I GOT SOUL BUT I'M NOT A SOLDER""""... ready lets rolls onto something new! ...""You gotta embrace new songs.At first I bought this album mainly because it had Mr. Brightside on it. Popped it in my laptop and started listen... best choice of my life. All the songs have a catchy beat, bring-you-up lyrics (see Smile Like You Mean It) and best of all, it doesn't plague in the CD loudness wars--meaning that it isn't clipped or distorted to increase the volume, resulting in bad sound quality. Definitely import this album to FLAC.Songs: 5/5Sound Quality: 5/5Album Artwork: 5/5BUY THIS."
3,disappointing,"i was expecting a lot more from this album, as the two singles were absolutely amazing. ""jenny"" and ""smile like you mean it"" are very good tracks, but all the good music on this cd is in the front end. the quality falls off after ""somebody told me,"" fading into an oblivion of ""me-too"" rock with an artsy '80s feel. its not a bad album, much better than a lot of stuff ive heard, but i was certainly looking for more."
4,"Not much ""Fuss"" over this album","I heard ""Somebody Told Me"" on Fuse and instantly knew this band needed a thorough listen. Their stlye was 80's, but with a fresh twist. They didn't sound like the other bands riding this retro revolution. I really enjoyed the synth lines in ""On Top"" and ""Mr.Brightside"". ""Somebody Told Me"" is a great pop-rock song with good synth lines as well. Songs that wern't so hot were ""Andy Your a Star"" and ""Midnightnight Show"". ""Andy"" sounded too metal in the instuments and too pop in the vocals, and Midnight Show was... well I don't know what it was, but I didnt't like it.This is my first review but I've spun this album front to back and It's an awesome Cd to play on day when you want to listen to something really birght and fun. All in all a great everyday listen"
1,.....MORE OF THE SAME.....,"Here is the formula of this band:1) Make a catchy beat.2) Put it lyrics without sense (somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend).3) Make a disc with one ""hit"" song and the rest just songs that don't give anything new to music(I'm not saying that the hit does).4) People will feel like ""cool guys"" when they buy your music and think it is the best.5) YOU ARE KNOW A ROCK STAR !!!HEY WAIT!THIS FORMULA SOUNS ME LIKE ........mmmmmmmm........ o yes! FRANZ FERDINAND (if you like franz ferdinand album buy this and keep listening to crapy music)I know that most people will hate this review but that is because they will know that this is just the truth of this kind of bands and I know that this band will be easily forgotten into some months unless they have another hit and the story starts again."
2,. . . bring in the sophmores.. [yawn],"See Blur, Oasis, Franz Ferdinand, The YYY's, the Strokes, the Features for far superior offerings of the same formula. I know exactly what these young men are up to and their are many others who do it far better --particularly those they are affectedly emulating..Looks like corporate is hip to a new wave."
1,Killers???? More like Lamers......,"I got suckered into buying this steaming heap based on that 'Somebody Told Me' song. Too bad nobody warned me that that is the only decent song on the album. The rest of the album is composed of pathetic crooning on the part of the lead singer and blantant U2 copycatting on the part of the musicians. Worst of all are the inane lyrics. For example from the effluviant pile of dreck known as 'Believe Me Natalie', we find the scintilanting lyrics:'There is an old clichéUnder your Monet, baby'I rest my case. This one hit wonder will be forgotten in a year and that's good."
2,Alright for Emo,"They are an emotional-crap band no matter what but they did have some exceptional songs that paid off for the rest of the bad songs. I wish bands like this could stop doing 9 bad emo songs for each 2 good rock songsby the way;.........HE SUCKS AT SINGING!!2 best songs: Jenny Was a Friend of Mine & Andy, You're a Star2 worst songs: (THE REST ALL SUCKED)"
1,Save your time,"Someone had to cash in on dumbing down new wave for a new generation, and I guess it's these guys. Doesn't really matter, since in six months they'll be forgotten. If you want to be ahead of the curve, ditch this faux-indie schtick and start idolizing the Pig Destroyer."
1,Total Hollywood,"This music is so devoid of substance, they make other pretentious bands from this genre look deep. This is Hollywood's version of the New York/Garage Band scene, and it's AWFUL!! The lyrics? The blatant rip off of Blur's Girls and Boys (Somebody Told Me)? Blondie's ""Dreaming"" (Mr. Brightside)? Come on."
2,One Maybe Two Hits On A Below Par Album,"'Mr Brightside' is a great song, a little overplayed, but a great song. that is the extent of the praise I will give this album.Brandon Flowers is your classic manufactured pop star, nothing special lyrically or vocally, no real stage presence but he gets by on his enormous... ego and his feminine appearance which the girls go 'gaga' for.on the album vocally it is below par, the bass is simple and frustratingly dull, the guitar is energetic yet flat and the drumming... well, the drumming isn't that bad.Don't get this album, not all it's cracked up to be."
2,Not recommended,"""Smile Like You Mean It,"" ""Mr. Brightside,"" and ""Somebody Told Me"" are the best songs - but you've probably already heard at least two of these on the radio lots of times. ""Jenny Was a Friend of Mine"" and ""Andy You're a Star"" are OK - they're listenable tracks. Most of the rest is unlistenable filler - most of it after track 6 of the album. Just because radio seized on the few best tracks on the album doesn't mean that the album is good as a whole, and all the songs generally sound the same.Overall, as the reviewer whose headline reads ""What's The Hot Fuss About?"" said, as well as several others: as a whole this stuff is very average, mediocre even. It certainly is not innovative; it's the opposite. Not recommended."
3,A review of the Killers latest CD,I am not a very big fan of this kind of music and purchased it so I could listen to their songs that made it to singles. Everything else was just OK. I could be wrong though since this isn't my typical genre.
5,HOT HOT HOT FUSS!,oNE WORD EXCELLENCY! I enjoyed it and it was very very good. I liked Mr.Brightside alot!
2,heard it all before,"I don't see how someone here could actually mention these guys in the same breath as modest mouse. Sure, they demonstrate a knack for melody on a few songs, but their music is hindered by blase, crappy lyrics, such as ""I like soul, but I'm not a soldier."" Not to mention that a few of their keyboard and synth lines are blatant Cure rip-offs, and that there is no real complexity to the music on this album either, unless you consider just adding more keyboards and guitars to be complex. All in all, the Hot Fuss successfully illustrates what happens when a band spends more time cultivating their image than their songwriting abilities."
5,Killer,"Quality album with lots of songs that got made in to singles a good sign I always thinkAt the price well worth it, nice mix of songs including some real anthemsI'm mr bright side"
4,"He's right, similar to Ferdinand, only I like it","The Killers, like Franz Ferdinand, has also come out with a really strong and good debut. Sure, there is a bit of a formulaic approach to it, but only with some of the songs.Most of them stand out on there own though such as ""Somebody Told Me"", there first radio hit. Now ""Mr. Brightside"" may seem a bit cliché but it's still good. My personal favorite is ""Andy You're A Star."" This song seems a bit ostentatious at first, but the chorus mellows it down a lot, and it becomes more than just mildly pleasing by the end.I'm not saying they're the greatest, but they are pretty good. (Maybe it's the fact that they sound European but are from Las Vegas)"
5,"Great Catchy Tunes, too short though.","What a breath of fresh air this album is. I first heard of them, when they were featured on an episode of Fox's hit TV show ""The OC"". They played a couple of their songs, and they were extremely catchy, so I decided to grab one of their CD's.I started listening to it, and its really catchy and upbeat music to listen to, and its really well thought out.Then I went to a club in Rochester, NY, and the club was playing this album from start to finish, I knew that the killers had arrived.The only negative thing I can say is its too short, but is that really a negative thing? Alot of bands will put alot of poor ""filler"" songs in. Honestly this CD probably only has 1 filler song in the entire thing. The rest could easially be singles or hits.My favorite lyric ""you got a real short skirt, I wanna look up, look up""."
4,worth the fuss,"a delectable piece of pop that evokes a nice combination between nostalgia for the eighties and promise for the future. This band has done their homework and, like the awesome, electrifying Kaiser Chiefs, are blazing an exciting new trail for pop music."
3,"A ""nice"" album...","The Killers have produced a nice debut with ""Hot Fuss."" Although it is nothing new, I suppose its good there is a resurgence of this type of music than other types. New-wave? Pretty much 100% new-wave. That's the problem, its an exploration in this style - not outside of this style - not pushing the envelope. This said there are some high quality and original tracks on this record, like ""Mr Brightside"" and ""Somebody Told Me"" is a fine example of a pop single. However, the vocals on the remainder of the album just don't exite me at all. Dare I say, the vocals of Flower's border on the brink of boring in some tracks, just like some tracks lack intensity.However, it is a debut. Improvement is possible and probable."
3,A little too Hot.,"This was a great album just to play at parties or hanging out with a large group of drinking buddies - but I tried to listen to it on my own a few times and it felt too spectacular to just enjoy. I wish I could have connected with it on a personal level, but it's quite shallow. I think it was intended to be a party record, obviously, but I was left wishing it was more than just a brief hot fuss.But it's brilliant if you like to have fun and just play something loud at a party."
4,Musically Excellent,"I don't do this review thing normally, but I have to say this album has some of the best bass & drum sounds that I have heard in a long time. Jenny Was A Friend of Mine and All These Things That I've Done are fantastic. I LOVE Everything Will Be Alright - dare I say that almost reminds me of some sort of psychedelic Beatles song with some Joy Division tossed in??? - Anyway - I'm no writer, so I will spare you any more of my blah - this is a great album, I can't wait for their sophmore release -"
3,"Fun, but I'm kind of over it","Didn't think much of them at first, but the songs are so catchy that I couldn't help liking them. However, it's not one of those CD's that you can just listen to over and over and never tire of. The songs get old fairly quickly.I'm looking forward to their next effort, though I have a horrible feeling they may be a flash in the pan kind of band. I'm hoping they will prove me wrong!"
4,Good,"3.5 Stars is my actually rating for this. Mr. Brightside is the best song on the album, but there are a few other songs that are equally as good. I was just expecting this album to be better then it was, however it is still a good album and worth a listen, after all they are one of the hot new groups out there."
2,Why are they famous?,"I saw this band in Miami on 3/25/06. This band is the product of hype rather than talent. THeir lifespan could not be more than 2 years. This is ""poser rock""."
1,Somebody told me...,Sing this:Well somebody told meto buy this cd.Now it's a coastersitting under a glass of root beer.it's not confidentialit's got no potential.A wastin' A wastin' my money!Sorry I'm not the best lyricist but you get the picture.
1,not worth the fuss (or money) @ alll,"i bought the album b/c i heard Mr. Brightside & loved it.. however, soon discovered that that and Somebody Told Me r the only decent songs on this cd... wut a waste of money"
1,...,Pretty generic punk/pop... It seems that Flowers is jealous of Led Zeppelin because his band sucks ass.
1,Somebody Kill Me !!!!!!!,"If I have to listen to another song by the Killers, I'm going to put my nuts in a blender!"
5,Best Rock Album of 2004,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. That is the word to describe Hot Fuss. Out of all the 2004 releases by U2 and Green Day, their albums don't compare one bit to Hot Fuss. Every song has it's own great qualites and it's been three months and I still have not taken it out of my CD player. They will definiatly be winning a Grammy in 2005. All the best to them."
1,A bad copy of a bad copy,"To use the word ""derivative"" in a music review has become cliched but in this case it is apt. Interpol rehashed Joy Division and now Killers are rehashing Interpol. Poorly. But the two-decade lag cycle for ""retro"" to be redefined is holding firm, I imagine we will be palgued by Nirvana ripoff bands in a decade or so."
2,"It doesn't have to be poetry, but.","I really enjoyed the first 30 seconds of the first video I saw of the Killers. Then I listened to the lyrics. First of all I have heard this song already several times. Secondly, lyrics don't have to be great poetry, but when they manage to be both dumb and needlessly pretentious....Having now tried to give the whole album a fair trial, I must pass judgement - they are sad, pompous boys, who like to dress up in other people's music. Lack of originality wouldn't be the end of the world, since the melodies are generally pretty strong, but the lyrics! The lyrics are SO BAD I have trouble sitting through an entire verse (although I gave them two stars - I have to save a one star rating for things like Gwen Stefani's album). I wish the singer wouldn't try to pronounce his words like a Brit, either. Urgh.Yeah, I really hate this band."
3,Overrated,"This album is just hopelessly overrated-the first four tracks are not bad, but after that things fall apart as The Killers run out of memorable ideas. The final track Everything Will Be Alright is aimless filler, while those in the UK got put through hell with the inclusion of the horrible track Indie Rock 'n' Roll replacing the far superior Change Your Mind. All in all, Hot Fuss suffers from feeling like too much style over substance, and for putting all the singles and best tracks at the start, with the lesser efforts weighted towards the end."
3,Good music and vocals but drumming is horrid,I think The Killers are a good band. They write very good songs and I like fresh sound on this record. But I must say thatTHE DRUMMER IS HORRID!I actively dislike him for spoiling this album for me:-) Ronald's drum sequences somehow really bug me. Hello guys - get a new drummer! Maybe Interpol can lend you theirs. I dislike trashing records but I feel that here I am just giving a good advice. The Truth Must Be Told;-)
4,"excellent debut from this ""killer"" group!","First of all, I like rap and rock, so my music tastes are a little different from a lot of other people. Also, I like rap first, so when I went to the store to buy a rap cd and came home with this, well it was a little strange. But, I am incredibly glad that I did pick this up. I actually got the new limited edition with three new tracks on it that are all awesome and add to this already great cd. The first 5 songs are what really make the cd for me, because they are all catchy and fun. Then the cd starts to slow down, but thats not bad. The whole cd is excellent and should be picked up by everybody because the killers are here to stay."
5,Great surprise!,"A friend lent me this CD and I had no idea what to expect... Oh my! The outcome was beyond any of my expectations!!! Really cool and powerful music with strong roots on brit punk and electronica from the 80?s such as The Cure, Depeche Mode, and New Order; but also with a very up-to-date rock and roll sound upbeat... No matter what kind of music you?re into, I think that you can?t go wrong with this album."
4,"Good album, Great name.","As soon as I heard ""Somebody Told Me"" I jumped on my favorite p2p network and embarked upon breaking as many copyrights as possible. Afterwards I ran to the closest music store and picked up a copy to redeem myself from the onslaught of guilt I had aquired over the previous 48 hours.It is a wonderful addition to my collection, and a great relief from the continuous sound from bands like Three Days Grace, Saliva, and Evanescence which all sound like the same band with different singers. Its good to hear a progression from the crap that we had to put up with from the first 3 years of this decade.I enjoyed every bit of this album because of the new sound it provided that I had not heard before. I would give it 5 stars, with the exception of one small problem... the lead singer stole my name (Yes, we really do have the same name)."
5,Awesome.,"This is a fantastic album.I love the artwork, the songs are justamazing.I love to play this on repeat, wherever I am."
4,good but not great,"This is the Killers first cd and it starts off with a real bang. You just cant help but like the songs. When that first single came out i absolutely hated it. Whats with those stupid lyrics. Then Mr.Brightside was featured on the o.c, and i loved it. The first 6 songs on the album are really good then it kind of drags out a bit. I cant get enough of that wierd spacey tune called smile like u mean it though. great song. this is also not an album that everyone should be praising like it should be on the top 10 albums of all time. p.s i meant to give it 3.5 stars."
4,Reminiscent of The Smiths,"Fab album, I bought it based on some of the reviews here and was not disappointed. ""Smile Like You Mean It"" is very reminiscent of The Smiths and ""On Top"" is also a great song which starts with this clubby type of beat, then changes into an off-kilter song which has great vocals. This band is fab, and for anyone who loves the British indie style bands this is a must!"
5,NOT GONNA REPEAT WHAT HE SAID...,"SO YEA, EVERYBODY HERE HAS SAID THEY MIX IN AN 80S SOUND...BUT, THEY NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT THERE WAS AN INDUSTRIAL FEEL TO THIS ALBUM...IT'S REALLY GOOD, THOUGH, EVERY SONG ON IT I LIKE, AGAIN, WHICH IS RARE...AND ITS UPBEAT, AS OPPOSED TO A LOT OF INDIE ROCK...BUY IT, IT'S WORTH THE $15...-CHRIS-"
3,Reasonable,"This album is okay, but to me it seems every song is a rip-off of something else. The production on this disc isn't too good either, with some tracks (Andy, You're A Star) sounding fuzzy and distorted. Brandon Flowers' faux British accent gets annoying, too.Smile Like You Mean It is a great song, however."
4,Awesome cd period.,"I really like this cd, its like they made pop-industerial dance music popular, its really cool and fun. when first heard somebody told me i thohgt hte whole cd would be lke that when in fact a lot of its kind of off shooty rock and poppy but i really enjoy it a lot, keep up the good work!"
4,Return of the 80's (This is a good thing),"Interesting album, reminds me of the peak of the 80's New Wave Scene. Danceable pop that rocks. Interesting songs. Sure ""Somebody Told Me"" is over played, but the CD will give you a chance to explore other fine tracks that ""Radio"" does not play. Tracks like ""Jenny was a Friend of Mine"", ""Smile Like You Mean It"" and ""Midnight Show"" make for a well-rounded disc loaded with great tunes. It will be interesting to see if this band can survive the 2 hit wonder status (Mr. Brightside being the second song released), or will my kids be watching 2 hit wonders of 2004 on VH1 in 2024"
3,The Glories of Mary,"The is good for a reference - it does give the Catholic view of Mary and how Catholics treat Mary as an almost God, which I disagree with."
1,"This is Part I of a 3 part Book, dont buy this one.","As a warning anyone who is familiar with a more credible 'Glories of Mary' book, they can run 500-600 pages depending.This short version in a small format(7""x5""), with large print, is only 189 short pages. This printed version is not for the discriminating buyer."
4,Mixed Bag,"I just discovered Michael Connelly and while I have really enjoyed his other books this is my least favorite so far. Parts of it are incredibly entertaining and it is interesting to view Bosch through the eyes of another character (McCaleb) and the idea of weaving together two murder cases is good, but, for me, the story gets a bogged down by both the solving of the two cases and the courtroom scenes. Reading so-called ""courtroom drama"" for me is incredibly boring. Apart from some clever word-play and maybe a ""gotcha"" moment, it's mostly just hot air...no action, no enjoyable writing, very little character development. Still, this doesn't deter me from wanting to read all of Connelly's books b/c those moments with the dark-hearted Bosch are worth it."
4,A Gripping Read,"This was the first Michael Connelly novel I read. I enjoyed it a great deal. I read it on a beach vacation at it was perfect for that purpose. Not too demanding of a read. Connelly really kept the pages turning, right until the very end. This is a good intro to Connelly as he uses Harry Bosch and Terry McAleb as the main protagonists of the novel. One complaint, even from a first time reader, the notion that Bosch committed this murder was not very believable.All in all I highly recommend this book as a great way to pass the time at the beach. However, certainly not a great work of literature."
2,truly dissapointing,"this is the first book from connelly that i picked upi like the theory and revelation leading to the painter who coincidentally was also bosch.. i also enjoyed the interpretation of bosch's painting but what i don't enjoy outweighs what i enjoy about the book...the thing about the owl and bosch was really fascinating but i was dissapointed on how the story was told..it wasn't really interesting and there's no flow to the story..i also thought the scene where bosch was in court was too long and boring, again, the way the story was told was very very boring..at that moment i really wished sidney shieldon had wrote the scene in court as he portrays lawyers as alan shore-like which is such a delight to read...i was so dissapointed as the elements of the story was top notch with owls, religion, darkness etc but the way it is told was just plain boring.."
4,Michael Connelly is a genious,"I am surging through the Bosch series and loving every minute of it.First, this book would probably get very low reviews if the reader hasn't read the previous ones.For those who have been reading the series, I think you will love this one. Connelly has a gift of pulling from previous books and developing top notch plots. This book has Harry in the midst of a trial against an arrogant Hollywood show-off. McCaleb, from Blood Works, is asked to look at a murder book on a victim who Bosch knows well. McCaleb is lead down a road where Bosch becomes a prime suspect. The 2 plots then come together at the end.I really liked the reference to the painter Bosch's pieces. I found them very interesting.This story kept me on the edge...I was pleased with the resolution, however, the only thing that puzzled me was the ending. I had to read the last 2 pages to figure out if there was something I missed....I hope I didn't."
4,"Best since the ""Poet""","Michael Connelly hit a home run with this installment of Harry Bosch. This is his best book since the ""Poet."" I highly recommend it to all Connelly fans."
3,Dark film director,This is the eighth book I've read from Michael Connelly and it was just okay. The concept of strangulation for sexual pleasure is disturbing and the movie director is very arrogant. Harry Bosch is also falsely accused of interfering in the case.
1,Just silly,"I have read a few Michael Connelly Harry Bosch books. I cannot say I am a great fan. But this finally just turned me off. The secondary hero, McCaleb, is supposed to have been an FBI profiler. Makes you wonder, when he suddenly decides that his friend, or at least long time colleague Bosch has turned into a bizarre killer.This McCaleb is an idiot in other ways, or I guess Michael Connelly has never checked on baby behavior: McCaleb has a 4month old child that needs almost hourly feedings through the night. This is utter nonsense. Not even a newborn needs hourly feedings at any time, much less a 4month old one. A doctor should be called, for the parents!Way too much boring filler in this book."
3,Weak on Plot,"Like most of the other reviewers, I have read all of Connelly's work. He has got the ""pulp mystery"" down as far as style. He is unevem on plot, though. Sometimes this means a complete surprise ending involving characters that were not even relevant until the last 20 pages -- clueless (to the reader) perpetrators, in a sense. ""Darkess"" is the opposite. The readers knows who did it within the first 30 pages and also knows that the leading suspect throughout the book is not the guilty one. So disappointing to know so quickly where things are going and then read on to discover you were right. A good effort with a majoy weakness."
4,Victor G,"As with all ""Harry Bosch"" stories this one doesn't dissapoint - I have tried to analyse why these Connelly novels make it difficult to put the book down and I have come to the conclusion that it is not only ""harry's"" strength of character but it is also his frailty. He never comes across as being a ""james Bond"". Harry endears himself to the reader because he can be Rude,surley, usually unpopular with colleagues and awkward with female company - in short we see him as human and not so different from ourselves.I wait for good things to happen for Harry but they don't seem to and I guess that is the reason for his popularity - he is generally the underdog (like with his bosses and power players etc)and we are on his side"
4,another Winner,If you enjoy The Harry Bosch series you will find this very satisfactory.Especially enjoy the subtle clues embeded through the story.Also enjoy the interconnections between the various books in the series
2,Hated the ending - SPOILERS,"Another Harry Bosch book that was ruined by a terrible ending. - How could Bosch possibly know that the victim would be contacted by the bail bondsman? Plus I hated the implication that Bosch set the events in motion that led to the murder, even though he is a rogue detective in many ways. I want him to remain a good guy, despite his tendency to disregard orders or bend the rules!I also thought McCaleb was a bit quick to suspect Bosch. It never occurred to him that it may all have been a set-up, which would have been much more likely than Bosch being a murderer."
5,Another winner for Connelly,Connelly has produced a book that literally the reader along from peak to valley and on to a new peak. Definitely a page turner.
4,Get this one soon.,They just keep getting better and better and this one is no exception. I really care about Harry and what happens in his life and look forward to reading his next adventure.
5,Connelly books are great,I love all the Harry Bosch series and this one was excellent. A real page turner. Couldn't put it down
3,Thin - thin - thin,I thought this was a very thin plot - Mister Connelly stretched the ink to make the characters mesh. Somewhat disappointed.
3,Connelly Where Are You?,"Has a hint of Michael Connelly, however, seems to be written for the female market. All others I've read (everything he's written save one), were great cop-fiction holding back nothing. This story seems like his female editor took charge on a majority of the story, deep character fleshing out, lots of mental drama, little action."
5,Pure Jazz,"All of Michael Connelly's books should be read while listening to classic jazz. Connelly himself will clue you in to the artist that he believes would provide the best soundtrack (in this case it is Art Pepper's sweet, sexy sax). ""Darkness"" is an interesting mix of police procedural and courtroom drama. Harry Bosch is testifying in a celebrity case and there are complications. An ex-FBI profiler, Terry McCaleb (Bloodwork) is called into profile a bizarre murder of one of Bosch's prey. All roads lead to Bosch. As always, Connelly's writing is suberb. His plotting is exquisite. And his character development sets the standard for the genre. This is a great read!!!"
3,Bosch plus 1,"I have missed Harry Bosch and would like to have had more of him. Meeting Terry McCaleb again, after Blood Work, was good but Harry is so much better. Harry is crusty, blunt, and a good cop. Terry is a bit too calm for me. Don't get me wrong, this is a good book, but I want more of Harry!"
3,Here's to Harry,"A darkness more than Night, was not one of his better stories. A little draggy. Not much to the book"
5,Bosch and Cnonelly are back better than ever...,"After two weaker efforts, Angels Flight and Void Moon, Connelly is back with a vegenance here (in more ways than one). The story is tight and very noir. This is not happy story for either bosch or terry. It probes motive and explores the pysches of both burdened men. It has the usual brillant touches--a paragraph where Bosch sees Thelma from Void Moon going back to work--and a note about selling the TV and Movie rights to Blood Work. Jack McEvoy is here and still a bit sleazy (although his sleaze factor is no where near that of earlier reporters in this series). A bit outlandish at times, but overall a wonderful book that explores motives and behaviors of the good guys."
5,Bosch again,"Terry McCaleb is revealed in this episode. He has an equal or even a greater role than Harry, though Harry is the subject throughout. A great read that took me away from my own troubles."
4,Another gem from a master story teller,"Reading a Bosch thriller is like going to visit an old familiar friend. But is our antihero descending into the darkness given his years chasing evil? Trying to decide whether he is right or wrong belies our fascination w his battle against evil.A new character serves as a foil to see our hero objectively. This allows us to look at Harry in a new light,a darker more frightening look into his tortured soul. It is a great read and for those not initiated into the Harry Bosch series, despite that fact that it is well along the series, it is still a great read."
5,"Enjoyable, entertaining, a fast-paced thriller","This is only my second Michael Connelly book (the first being ""Void Moon""), so I wasn't familiar with the two principal protagonists. However, after reading this book, I want to know all about them. I am in the process of scouring book-sellers and auction sites for earlier Michael Connelly novels, particularly books featuring these two characters..This book draws you right in from the opening chapter and is paced well. It certainly keeps you turning pages. The finally little twist in the plot gives you something to consider. Michael Connelly is a skilled and entertaining writer. After only two books, I am adding him to my list of ""Buy anything new by..."" authors.Whether or not you are familiar with his other books, please do yourself a favor and read: ""A Darkness More Than Light."""
4,Well-done!,"I enjoyed Terry McCaleb's character far more in this book than in ""Blood Work."" Mr. Connolly does a spiffy job of taking us through the profiler's logic and thought processes, and he somehow manages to keep track of minutiae that would send most authors screaming for Prozac. The only flaw that I see in this book is an arguable one: This was really a McCaleb story, far more so than a Harry Bosch story. And the fact is, for me, Harry remains a far more intriguing character than McCaleb. So I give this book 4 stars instead of 5, only because I wanted more Bosch! (For a 5-star Bosch story, ""Angels Flight"" is the one to read.)"
3,Not Connelly's Best,"I was pretty excited about this book, I mean, Connelly has yet to disappoint me. I picked up Void Moon with much trepidation and loved it, so imagine my excitment when Connelly decided to use McCaleb to investigate another main character of his books, Harry Bosch. Unfortunately, this book did not have much of what I love in Connelly books, including the dark, poetic nature. Much of the reflection done by the characters seemed too forced and I felt that Connelly actually took some bad directions with some of his characters. Added to that was the inclusion of at least one or two characters from every book he has written, which also seemed a little forced. Now, maybe three stars is a harsh rating for this book, but it doesn't stand up to his previous works at all. Still, I will race out to buy his next one."
2,Major Problem Sinks Plot,"That Terry McCaleb (of Connelly's earlier novel _Blood Work_) could somehow, even for a moment, suspect Harry Bosch of being a murderer? This is a plot twist that pretty much blows the book apart--if you're even a tiny bit familiar with the Bosch series, this is going to hurt your reading. This twist marks the beginning of a three-book downturn for Connelly, which he's only recently recovered from with _Lost Light_."
1,Sheesh,"... The premise of this book is ludicrous: a respected and dogged police detective, of many years standing, becomes the prime suspect in a grisly killing? And might have killed a bunch of other bad people? Huh? If you've read any other Bosch books (...), you'll know that Harry ain't no freakin' killer. The whole idea is aggravating. The wimpy asides of his detectives make me gnash my teeth, and the awful (even embarrassing) predicaments he shoves them into make you wonder how they ever got to the lofty heights he claims for them. The former FBI profiler in this book is an idiot. And his wife and kids, over whom so much angst is spilled? Nonentities..."
5,A darkness more than night,"As usual Micheal Connelly write an excellent Harry Bosch novel, I have been reading these frome the start and I just love Harry.Keep up the good work Micheal and don,t give up on Harry"
3,A Darkness More than Night,"OK but not as good as the other titles I have gotten. Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors, but this is not up yo his standards."
3,Medium,"I'm a big fan of Connelly (Angels Flight is a classic detective novel) but this is one of his average efforts. I agree with other reviewers that the solution is telegraphed. I also think that the ""revelation"" about Bosch in the last few pages (McCaleb's last visit to Bosch) doesn't withstand scrutiny. I won't explain why because I don't want to give away the plot but I can't see how it jibes with the rest of the book. Still, I could barely put the book down and it was very entertaining."
3,Just readable. Not as good as before. Kinda disappointed.,"The trial scenes are too much and too long with Bosch sitting through. I have to jump over almost all the tiresome court scenes to get to the next development. This one is with very loose structure with no passion, no tension, no nothing in it. If Harry Bosch keeps losing his edge and becoming a very vague figure like this one and his last several ones, Connelly would lose lot of his loyal fans who have been so craving for his creations. No cigar this time neither for the writer nor the readers. A total disapointment. It might be still readable, but for how long?"
3,"A ""Face-Off"" plot","Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb face off to solve an intricately plotted crime - one that points initially to Bosch as the lead suspect. Well-written, tightly plotted and interesting to have two lead characters. However, I am tired of seeing so much of Harry's dark side - I hope the next novel brings hope and even some humor back to Harry."
3,Good but not great.....,"While this book was more entertaining than a lot of books out there, it does not live up to the normal high standards set by Mr. Connelly himself. To me the mark of an outstanding book is one in which I feel frustrated if I have to put it aside to do other normal daily activities. This book did not meet that criterion. If the book had disappeared for some reason before I'd finished it I would not have cared much. I too did not find it reasonable for McCaleb a seasoned, experienced former agent to fall so easily into believing the worst of Bosch. I would recommend Connelly's earlier works if you want to read truly excellent writing."
1,You just can't recover from a ludicrous premise!,"I have enjoyed other Connelly books (I would give Brass Verdict 5 stars) but this book makes leaps of judgment from scant evidence. Try other Connelly books, but pass on this one."
2,Major Disappointment,"Having read all of Michael Connelly's books, some of them more than once, I was looking forward to this one because he was teaming his characters McCaleb and Bosch for the first time. What I didn't know was that he'd come up with the ludicrous idea of having McCaleb think Bosch was guilty of murder, perhaps even being a serial killer! Those of us who've read this series know Harry Bosch has got a lot of flaws, but deep-seated psychosis isn't one of them. So, the book just didn't ring true for me and completely lacked any suspense. Bosch and McCaleb would've been better served if Connelly'd had them tracking a serial killer together, instead of Bosch trying to prove his innocence. Plus the references to Connelly's other books (Poet and Void Moon) were disconcerting. Reread The Black Echo or The Concrete Blonde and hope Connelly returns to form with the next book."
2,A master of the genre disappoints,"This falls far short of the very high standard Michael Connelly set with his fabulous early books Black Echo and Black Ice. Later efforts have varied in quality, and this unfortunately isn't one of his better ones.The pivotal piece of the plot is not even vaguely credible. Without spoiling it for you,the main character (a retired FBI agent) would have to be a complete idiot to respond as he does to the key ""clues."" A second key turning point is equally unconvincing.He is still writes well and can move the story, but one hates to report the decline in one of the best mystery writers."
1,He Must Have Red Dragon on His Night Stand,"A former serial killer profiler for the FBI recovers on an island with his new wife and new baby...until a former colleague brings him a file to look at...the file intrigues him...he gets the scent again...the murders are inspired by famous renaissance paintings...This is my first, and now only, Michael Connelly book I've read...prodded by all the good reviews here...The above description fits DARKNESS, but it could also fit Thomas Harris's first Hannibal book, RED DRAGON, which is a classic of the genre, whereas DARKNESS is just business - selling tired plots without a clearly drawn central evil-doer (unlike, obviously, Hannibal)...the film producer of DARKNESS is only shown at the defense table reacting to the trial...the actual perps are only tossed in at the end...an in between you get an average level of police-procedural dialogue...An extremely disappointing read."
3,When I figure out the mystery before the profiler does ...,"... I lose interest in the book. It is not badly written and has some fairly engaging moments, but once it became obvious what was going on (about halfway through) I just skipped ahead to the ending. With some mystery/thrillers, you can figure out the killer and his plot and still enjoy the book, but I didn't find this to be one of them."
3,starts and ends well but soft in the middle,This is the first Connelly novel I have read and it did not meet the hypeI liked the way he began the novel and it had a strong ending as well.The attempted frameup of Bosch was alsoclever. However the middle 200 or so pages of the book seemed padded at times and connelly's unfelicitous prose did not help. I recommend the book but only marginally
4,"HATTY BOSCH, THE GREAT","HARRY BOSCH PLAYS A BIT OF A DIFFERENT ROLE IN THIS NON STOP NOVEL. SO HAPPENS, AN EX FBI GUY BECOMES DOMINATE AS INVESTIGATOR TO A DEAD CASE THAT BOSCH WON'T LET GO.CONNELLY IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS, AND BOSCH IS A MADE FOR MOVIES CHRACTER.IF THEY CAN DO A ""JACK REACHER"" IN HOLLYWOD WITH A MINITURE ACTOR PLAYING A 6'5"" BIG STRONG GUY THEY COULD DO REAL WELL WITH HARRY BOSCH."
3,An entertaining read as usual.,"I have read all of this series and find them entertaining. I can put them down, but I always pick them up again and findthem enjoyable."
4,"You'll Miss Bosch, But Still A Good Read","It's hard for me to care about Terry McCaleb as much as Harry Bosch, but Bosch is in this one anyway, which helps. Even with Terry as the hero, though, this is a solid MC book. And by that I mean you get swept up into the situation, you're not sure what's going to happen, and then the adrenaline kicks in and you're hopelessly hooked in a sprint to the finish. And this one is no different. I would not recommend this one as a first MC novel, but it's pretty damn good."
4,Another very good Harry Bosch novel,Perhaps not one of Connelly's best but his second tier stories are still among the best detective yarns on the market.
1,Worse of humanity,"You'd get the same effect by farting and belching into a microphone. Hey adolescents of the world, wouldn't THAT be extreme? Utter garbage from start to finish. No musical quality at all. Talentless hacks."
1,UM...SHOULD THIS EVEN BE CLASSIFIED AS MUSIC?,"Slayer is metal, I even like Carcass, but Cannibal Corpse...just a bunch of retards with instruments and a microphone. I laugh so hard everytime I hear this band. What a joke! Do they have the cookie monster on vocals or something? The only thing I can think of that is funnier than this sh*t music is the fans it generates! I see at least one person a week wearing some lame Cannibal Corpse t-shirt, it's funny as hell because you know they're just wearing them for attention and the hope that they will offend someone. It's comedy to me...just like Insane Clown Posse...a bunch of posers! If I want to be offended, I'll take GG Allin thank you!"
1,I agree - Garbage at its finest.,"Yo, this is trash!!!!!!! Who the hell listens to constant screaming and banging like wild animals and blaring guitar through the whole song and groweling like a bear or something?!!!!!! This is such trash I decided it's not even worth running over with my car, because it would touch my tires. I won't even smash it with a hammer cause it would poison my hammer and I wouldn't be able to touch that anymore. Cannibal Corpse can f**king rot in hell for the rest of eternity, which is about all they talk about - If by some miracle you can understand a single word spoken on this garbage album. This sh*t gets negative ten stars from me at the very least. Go buy music, not heavy metal."
1,Cannibal Corpse Sucks,"Cannibal Corpse is one of if not the worst metal bands of the 80's and 90's (todays ""metal"" is worse though), and this is coming out of a person who likes metal and listens to it more than anything else. I don't see how anyone could think this is deserving of anything over 2 stars. The guitar player is just playing the same chord over and over again and has WAY too much distortion for his own good, the drummer is just banging on the kit with hammers, and the singer, oh my god...the lyrics are all about gore and crap. This band is just a bunch of posers. If you want death metal I suggest getting Death, old Sepultura, and Obituary instead. Cannibal Corpse are posers."
5,vile display of good music.....or is it?,"Well, im a 'vile' is my first death metal album (bought it out of wonder) and i must say it is a great album. Even the simple opening to pucture wound massacre can't sway my virdict: for people who make fun of this opening, listen to the rest of the song. Plus, for people who are long time listeners to cannibal corpse: when you keep writing about the same thing over and over, it gets alittle boring, so when you look at 'vile's lyrics, just think that management was restructuring. Thats just my opinion, i could be wrong."
4,"at last, an evolution of sorts","i think that the old singer was holding these guys back. How else to explain the difference between this album and the previous ones? Contrary to what you may hear, Tomb of the Mutilated is alrigth but is not there masterpiece. This album is much better. While the barnes era albums were ok, this one steps it up a notch in musianship if not intensity. Theres more grooves here, hints of dare i say, melody? small hints mind you but enough so that the songs can be distinguished from one another...something not so easy to do in times past. Monolith is a monster and is possibly the best corpse out there. The corpsegrinder has arrived and he has done well."
4,None So Vile,"This album is so impressive that you might forget that Chris Barnes was ever in the band. Heading in the same direction that the Bledding started, the album is probably the highlight of death metal. From the wicked fast Mummified in Barbed Wire, to the masterfully written Disfigured, to the ultra creepy Eaten from Inside, the album reeks of heavy metal. Everything is well written and much more intelligible than the early albums. Buy."
3,Brutality,"This album is good for times when you don't want complicated lyrics or songs-just straight forward brutality and death metal. This is classic cannibal corpse, the infamous death metal crew.The music is heavy, and the guitarwork fine and sometimes technical. If you enjoy CC, this is an album for you. However the songs are somewhat similar, with constantly the same Americanized gore lyrics over and over again. I believe it is only a matter of time until this band runs out of subjects for songs, with everything already being eaten, mutilated, sodomized, and whatnot.For more thinking oriented metal heads not a good choice, but that this is heavy metal is not in question!"
3,A CLEAN VILE IS LIKE DIRTY SOAP,"""Cannibal Corpse"" could make music beating on a wooden coffin with a cardboard amplifier and I'd still listen. If not, I would be fearful of missing the moment the corpse from hell is finally resurrected."
1,?,"This is not music, even not death metal. It is just noise. You may think I'm not a death metal listner but I am. Try, at least, to listen to in flames and see what the real death metal is"
1,"Another Terrible Cannibal Corpse CD,So Whats New.","My definition of death metal:loud noise that sounds the same.Yep,the title says it all,this CD is vile.I would tell you what the worst song on the CD is,but I can't since they are all the same song.Yep,same drum beats,same distorted guitars,same useless screaming.If you love mindless noise,then be sure to pick up a copy of Vile by Cannibal Corpse.Peace Out."
1,Crap flavored fesces,"This so called ""piece of music"" is the biggest puddle of crap I have ever listened to. I would rather help a 95 year old man put on a jockstrap. To sum this trash up in a sentence I would have to say that this awful band is equivalent to a pile of crap smothered in fesces."
1,And people still fall for it.....,"Anytime a CD by CAnnibal Corpse is old, I'm sure the guys from the band keeps laughing a lot, imagining there was someone out there so naive to buy their cheap and ridiculous ""music"" and, even worse, to listen to their psicopathic lyrics.From the cover art to the ""music"", everything in CAnnibal Corpse is made consciently to shock, since they just are no able to play..."
1,EEwwwww! Gross!,"If the thought came to the Backtreet Boys' heads to become a'metal' band, THIS is what they would sound like. Cannibal Corpsesounds like the Backstreet Boys on speed. Or crack(get it, Crackstreet Boys). Corpse is probably the most disgusting band. Is this some sort of joke? If it is, than it's not funny anymore. If you can get past the sick covers and bonehead subject matter, than Vile is for you! Otherwise, listen to Metallica, Slayer, KoRn, Nine Inch Nails, Alice In Chains, anything that is music(not what CC is) and has real emotion."
1,Just awful,"Just like the rest of their music,which is all just mindless noise.I've had MUCH better times breaking my arm and having a couple of teeth pulled than listening to this horsecrap these mindless fools call music."
5,Awesome,"This is one of the best, probaly almost as good as The Bleeding. It is the first with George Fisher and he did best on this album. Its really good so buy it now!!!"
5,brutal!!!!!!!!!!,"i have three cannibal corpse albums, and they are not short on brutality. my reason for getting this album was for the song mummified in barbed wire, but the whole album is good."
5,lets kill,these cd is awesome george fishers vocals are just as good as the king of death metal chris barnes this is a killer album buy this sh#T the drums there fast the bass work is really good aswell i think the lyrics are insane one of my all time favs
3,AN OKAY ALBUM.,"Musically speaking,this album is pretty good.Good guitar work and its pretty heavy.My only real gripe lies in the fact that I just dont like the new singers style.This album could have been better with chris barnes vocals and lyrics added to this release.To conclude,I didnt really enjoy this cd as I wish I had but others might like this.CANNIBAL CORPSE RULES!!!"
3,EXCELENT CANNIBAL CORPSE ALBUM,"MY CANNIBAL CORPSE FAVORITE ALBUM IS 'BLOODTHIRST', BUT VILE IS A EXCELENT ALBUM.THIS ONE HAVE TECNICAND HEAVY RIFFS BUT THE VOCALS ARE NO SO GOD THAN 'BLOODTHIRST' IN SHORT, CANNIBAL CORPSE IS PURE METAL. I RECOMEND, AND F**K THE 'NEW IN FLAMES'!!!!!!"
2,disappointing,"In my opinion, this is Cannibal Corpses's worst release. I loved Butchered at Birth and Tomb of the Mutilated but this is very disappointing. Corpsegrinders vocals are the worst on this album and their songwriting abilities are at an all time low. If Chris Barnes was still with the group at the time, he could have really helped this album out. I do however tend to pop this in my CD player from time to time."
1,REALLY VILE!,"That's right! The title speaks for itself. This is one of the most repugnant CDs on the planet. Cannibal Corpse never fails to show how bad they are. Like I said, the ""music"" on this album is what the title says it is, other than the fact that it's sick and shows no form of musical skill and talent. The drumming is completely off-beat, repeating the same rhythm over and over. The guitar riffs are basically the same repeated three-chords noise with each song. Cannibal Corpse is trash."
1,Its just noise.... Not music !,"Vile by cannibal corpse sucks because this album not only gives me a big headache but also sounds the same every time as the previous song. I try giving cannibal corpse a chance but it just doesnt work... They just dont do it for me, im sorry. Now, if you guys want to listing to some good solid death metal that doesnt give an headache and you can actullie understand what the singer is sayng pick up ""other"" arist""s""... Nile,suffocation,morbid angel,napalm death, garden of shadows, borknagar, daylightdies,the crown,amorphis,origin,hate-eternal,obituary,acoustic torment, at the gates, the haunted,dark tranquiliti,darkane,dyinfetus,eye hate god etc... In other words, real death metal, not pointless horrible noise ... bands, that choose to be call ""death metal"" . Laters !"
5,Excellent book for the do-it-yourselfer.,"This book was recommended to me by a supplier of radon mitigation equipment and is excellent. It has more than adequate design and installation to allow a reasonably competent DIYer to design and install their own radon mitigation system. In addition, it covers the necessary safety precautions to take in the process.If you don't plan to install your own system, but simply want to be informed as you work with a professional, then this book will also serve you well.Now if I can just find a book of this type for septic system design...Matt"
2,I Don't Do Pot or Other Narcotics - I Usually Love Rifftrax,"Being very anti-drug person - the movie in itself shows insight into the difference from the 1930's perspective of anti-drug (Pot) and how riddiculous they thought pot affected people - as opposed to some of the negatives we now know of this drug. I admit I did chuckle a few times - especailly a riff about Paul McCartney and paying his alimony checks, but anti drug or not - this Rifftrax fell flat for me. In fact of my Rifftraxs collection - I aim to unload this one. I Do love 'Plan 9' and 'Galaxy Invaders' (as well as others). Unless you are an ultimate stoner and laugh at most anything - I'd skip this DVD. Sincerely, Scott."
4,The original teenage wizard story,"A wonderfully written tale that is enjoyable at many levels. It is highly readable, flows well and has some profound lessons about human nature, death, good, evil, etc. LeGuin's choice of names leaves something to be desired (i.e., Ged, Vetch and Jasper) and the characters are not developed as fully as one might expect. Overall, a satisfying read. This book predates Harry Potter by some 30 years and the parallels that Rowling borrowed are striking and a tribute to the notoriety of this book. Recommended."
5,Great book,"I would have to say this is a great series started with a fantastic book. I love the characters in this book; they are so interesting and different that you'll find yourself really drawn to them. They learn lessons in life and are changed by it, and you can especially see this in reading the later books. Its great! Not many stories do that, and sometimes the ones that do don't do it realistically.The story was really good as well. There was always something to look forward to and you always wanted to know where it would lead. The writing was great in my opinion, sometime Ursula went off on tangents that I found incredibly boring, but when she stuck to her story and didn't try to do. . . whatever you want to call it (boring prose?). . . then it was great. Heck there were even good lessons in this book. Read them to find out, as I don't want to spoil ANYTHING. . .Its a classic (like LOTR), and for good reason (it was very inventive), so treat yourself to it."
5,My favorite book.,"This book is better than Harry Potter, it has a much more immersive story, with infinite possibilities, the characters are very solid, and clever, Ursula Paints the very image of Earthsea in your mind!"
3,"Good, But Not Great","I have say I was not so impressed with A Wizard of Earthsea. Reading the editors' reviews of the book on Amazon, they compare it glowingly to Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, but I just don't see it. Granted this is only the first book, and I will likely read the second, but it certainly was not the caliber of Tolkien. The book is rather choppy and written in a sort of third person narrative that gets annoying after time. I also felt the plot and writing were rather immature. This was one of Le Guin's early works, but it still needed a good editor. I can see, however, why The SciFi Channel has opted to make it into a mini-series, the story is simple high fantasy -- nothing too difficult, nothing too mind boggling. It will probably do well."
2,Started strong but fell apart at the end,"I read the first chapter of this book and I thought, ""Wow! This is really going to be a great book"". I was wrong. The first chapter of the book was exciting, well described and emotional. However, the rest of the book was a steady decline from there.In the middle of the book there is an encounter with a dragon. However, it's glossed over and much of the detail is left out. A lot of detail is given in sailing from this island to that island. Personally, I would like to gloss over all the sailing and spend more time on the conflict with the dragon and the final conflict at the end."
2,A lack of depth and flawed writing style hold this story back,"One of the basic tenets of writing good fiction is ""show me, don't tell me."" An example: Tell - ""Ged didn't like Jasper."" Show - ""Ged felt a strong urge to punch Jasper right in his sniveling little face every time he looked at him. Every snide remark, every condescending look, increased the power of that urge.""Both of those examples convey that Ged didn't like Jasper, but which one brings you into the story and adds character development? That's the problem with the author's writing--pages and pages of narration. Too much telling and not enough showing. It makes the pace of the book very fast, which is nice, but it feels like watching a movie with the fast forward button pressed--you get the basic idea of what's going on, but none of the finer details. That's how reading this book feels."
2,So-so,"The story is slow and plodding. Granted, it was written for teens, but it felt as if someone where reciting a parable instead of telling a story. The ending was not engaging (like much of the book) nor was it much of a surprise. There is supposed to be some sort of environmental message. If so, it's a weak one.I give it two stars as I am a big fan of this genre, so I don't write it off as a complete waste of time. This is certainly not Le Guin's best work. The Lathe of Heaven was much better."
3,Read better.,"I know some have raved about how great this book is. Unfortunately I didn't feel that way. Not bad, but I've read better."
2,Unoriginal,"The book tries hard to be something of a Lord of the Rings story, but it rarely succeeds. We are quickly told about Ged and in the first few chapters he has lived about 4 years of his life, we rarely get a second to breathe or really know anyone, but Ged. And we hardly understand him either. It is quite a tedious read and uninteresting from this perspective. There are a few attempts (well, quite a lot actually) to capture the reader's attention, but unfortunately that is just what they are, attempts. This book isn't awful, but it is just like any other Fantasy book or Trilogy and doesn't stand out like Tolkein or Rowling's books. Read it if you like, but I would reccomend something with a deeper storyline, more colorful and dynamic characters, and events that keep the reader's attention and entertains them. This book doesn't do that."
5,Visit Earthsea again and again,"The world of Earthsea is so rich, textured, and well developed that it is hard to force yourself to leave it once the book is over. I know this is suppose to be a book for young adults but it doesn't read like a young adult book at all. The themes and topics addressed in the book really explore the universal state of humanity in a way that makes you think about your worldview. Even when surrounded by magic and dragons, Earthsea's epic story feels real."
2,mediocre fantasy,"The Amazon review compared this story to Tolkien's Middleearth and C.S. Lewis' Narnia, but the only thing this story has in common with those books is that it stole the basic concept for the Earthsea series from those classic fantasy series. There is nothing original about the story or the main character. It is obvious the author was trying to write it like it was an epic fantasy soon-to-be classic but to me it was so contrived and cliche. The story was so boring and lifeless that I forgot most it as soon as I finished it. Don't bother reading it."
3,A decent read,"I expected more from this book, given the reputation it's received over the years. It's difficult to read..the reader has to really concentrate to read the countless paragraphs without action. The whole evil shadow thing is very confusing."
2,Difficult Understandment,I (12 year old...just above average person) found this book quite challenging and difficult...I didn't understand it but there was some bits that I did understand! the bits I understood where pretty good (they were battle scenes)...only read this book if you are really desperate!
1,incredibly simple and boring!!,this book is written on about a 2nd grade level. it kept my attention for about 2 pages. it goes no where and is incredibly predictable when it does. the characters and and world are incredibly undeveloped and it lacks any fast paced action or excitement to make up for it. dont waste you time with this one or any of the sequels they dont get any better
5,One of the best fantasy books ever!,A Wizard of Earthsea ranks among the Chronicles of Narnia and the Wizard of Oz as the the best fantasy series I have read. From the start the story is intriguing and you don't want to put this book down. I recomend this to fantasy readers of all ages.
5,To Name is to Command,"This book is about the coming of a very powerful wizard, named Ged. I read this book when I was a child, but I found it much more interesting as an adult. Le Guin creates a world with it's own definition of magic, where the highest power is commanding something by wielding its true name. one of Ged's classes is simply learning the names of everything, and I found this simple but powerful. Some people will compare this Harry Potter. Potter is more detailed and comprehensive while Earthsea is more thematic and brief. I recommend reading them both."
3,Depends on what you want...,"Today's readers have different expectations than when this book was published.Today we want fast-paced epics with character-driven stories easy to relate to. A Wizard of Earthsea doesn't quite fit the bill.Not that it's bad.Le Guin is a great writer. Her use of language is terrific, very reminscient of Tolkien. However, like Tolkien, the narrative favors the story rather than the characters. The story is episodic in nature, and the characters (there's really only one main character) are not developed the way we're used to in today's fiction. Don't expect Charlie from Lost.Still, a fascinating story."
1,Audiobook Review,"The story is decent, though it suffers from the third person omniscient pov. Most of it is exposition, with very little feeling from the characters.But my primary review, and the rating of one star, is because of the narrator. His voicings are terrible. Even worse is how he speaks, screaming, stuttering, breaking up words and pronunciations in ways that no one would ever speak. Picture a high schooler who has just taken his first acting class and thinks he is a great Shakespearean actor. But it's even worse than that. Egads, what was the publisher thinking?"
5,Returning Reader,I read this trilogy when I was in eighth grade. The books were by far some of my favorites during my junior high years. I am now almost 30 and have enjoyed re-reading them. The stories are enthralling. I love that the wizard grows older and matures throughout the books. In the end he is wiser and so am I. Dive into the Wizard of Earthsea books. They are well worth your time.
4,classic,"I originally read Ursula LeGuin's 'A Wizard of Earthsea' many years ago in high school. I liked it, thinking it good but not great and certainly not anywhere near as good as 'The Hobbit' or any of the Narnian Chronicles. I think because of LeGuin's rather detached narrative style, compared to the personal storytelling narration used in the other books. This time around I was more impressed, it definitely deserves it's classic status (although I still don't think it's as good Tolkien or Lewis)."
4,Good story and very well written,"I liked the story, particularly the evolution of Ged's character throughout the book. I think the book is very well written, Ursula Le Guin uses a beautiful languange. The only drawback I find in this book is being a bit slow in some parts."
4,Interesting Book,"It is a good book for you to read if you are into fantasies. The whole book is quite interesting, but there are some ancient words you'll have to know"
4,Read This:I'm An Elementry Student Who Read Earthsea,"This book is awesome...I'm not 2 far,but I have had it for three days(I know,hard to get into).The part where Duny uses his powers to save his father's crew's life is good,and you don't have to wait-it's at the begginig!!That's my review.p.s.I'm not over 13-I'm 11."
5,An extraordinary tale,"Storytelling never loses its place at the forefront of this, the first book of the Earthsea Trilogy. This series has always been one of my favorites ever since I read it. Ms. Le Guin creates a believable world with characters that ring true on every page and the way she discusses and develops the importance of language and words in these novels is not only unique but powerful. Please read this series. You will not regret it."
5,excellent reading,"It's sad that every work like this has to be held up to Tolkien for comparison; the Earthsea trilogy (excepting, of course, the fourth and much later book) is a great work in its own right. It seems works like this are less popular now, whereas writers like Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan, who've ripped off a good portion of their ideas from older works, are more popular."
5,A hauntingly dark and beautiful story,"I would give this story 10 stars if I could. I read this when I was in grade 7 and it became my favorite book, now after university I still think this is one of the greatest fantasy books I've ever read. Le Guin takes you into her little wonderful world of islands with strange exotic names and builds a tapestry of characters and places with histories and cultures intertwined in a tale about a young wizard who meddles with the forces of darkness and has to deal with the consequences for the rest of his life. It is truly original in the same way that the Lord of the Rings was, and the Wizard of Oz was, and Alice in Wonderland was; a story that children can enjoy but that grows with you as you grow in life and learn to appreciate what good story telling is, and Le Guin is one of the best in the world."
1,A BAD book,"This book may have had a good moral but I think it couldv'e turned out a lot better if it wasn't so borring. I had to read this in school, and not one of my classmates liked it."
1,A Poor Man's Harry Potter,"I tried to get through this first book but just couldn't manage it. I was bored to tears. I presume Rowling was familiar with the basic idea of a young man going to wizard school and finding out who he really was, but Rowling did it brilliantly while Le Guin was just plain awful. I presume it was so popular when written because there just wasn't a lot of fantasy for fans of the genre. I'm amazed that it's still in print."
2,Earthsea more like a puddle,"First of all this book was too into names of things. How could naming something give you power over it? I don't know, it was not explained. Also, why did everyone have 2 names? As a coming of age novel, this novel was a pretty good book. But I wish there was more action in this novel. Sometimes Sparrowhawk or Gad or whatever name the main character in this novel was going by just seemed to sail and sail and sail. Boring. Thats ok there are plenty of other fish in the ocean (no pun intended), like the Gor novels which have plenty of action and more of an interesting storyline.PS. I didn't really understand that last part where sparrowhawk/gad goes head to head with the shadowy creature who has hunted him all threw the novel. It was not very clear what happened."
1,"WOW, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CLASSIC","Ok, I don't like fantasy, I don't really understand how people can read these books. How can you relate to some wizard with powers you know nothing about. Can you explain what it feels like, can you explain how you get it. Well, this book follows the ways of fantasy, you can't relate to this character, b/c you have no idea what he is going through, Le Guin doesn't tell us, she assume we are magicians. Plus, this book is boring (at least Tolkien makes for an interesting read). Man, I hated this book, back to science fiction, and Non-Fiction for me, this is my last foray into Fantasy."
1,"Horrible Book, Do Not Waste Your Time!","Very slow, dull, predictable, and wholly uninteresting. At no point does anything that happens come as even the slightest surprise. The battle sequences are very slow moving and would not interest anyone. It is a small book but it still took me over 3 weeks to drudge my way through this garbage. Afterwords I used it to start my fireplace, a task I am not sure its even worthy of."
1,I thought it sucked...,"This book was a waste of time.. The complicated fantasy gave me a headache, but I don't really like this kind of fiction... So if you like unrealistic fiction this is a MUST READ. If you really hate unrealistic fiction, and think it's a bunch of B-S, stay far away from it!"
4,A Wizard of EarthSea,This is a fun story for the younger crowd to enjoy (8 years and up). There is good character development in this story of a young boy growing up that sweeps you into the high adventure of wizards and magic and dragons that is sure to keep one riveted to this page turner.
2,My review,I thought the book was not good! It went by too fast and didn'tgive enough detail.It needs more charcters and needs moreadventure. Also we need to know more about Ged before Ogion comes.Alsothe book shoudln't just end it should be longer and not like just stop. The book was also good beacsue it had a good plot and a good theroy. END
2,Dazed and confused,"I give credit to Ursula for imanginative and creative scenerios of writing in this book, but must say I didn't enjoy reading it. I read this book in English last year and found the plot very hard to follow. This was not only my opinion, but the opinion of 30 other students. This book is definately not a page turner. I would only recommend this book to those of you who have very open imaginations, LOVE fantasy, and have the time to sit down and carefully read this book."
2,Flat allegory,"I've meant to read this for years. (Love Tolkien, Asimov's Foundation, and Harry Potter.)It is a painfully slow, grim story of two-dimensional characters and nature descriptions that reads more like the account of a self-flagellant religious than a story of discovery and adventure.Tolkein was right to distrust allegory in all of its forms.Rob Inglis got me through a book I would never have finished in print, but he also may have been the wrong reader for this story. Perhaps it would have been more persuasive read by a woman or a more juvenile voice."
3,"Good Read, too short and over-hyped...borrow it.","After reading a lot of second rate books I hope Earthsea would be a whole new look on fantasy. It still came out a disappointment, the book is written a little to childish for me. Therefore I am disgusted now when people compare Orsula K. Le-Guin to J.R.R Tolkien, Robert Jordan or George R.R. Martin. Tolkien's, Jordan's and Martin's greatness strength's are detailed stories and worlds. Le-Guin's skills are stuck at a childish level in this book and not fully developed. (Her only excuse is that she was a women stuck in the 60's, and forced to waste her Sci-Fi talents this way).My opinion might be skewed by the high praise this series got, ( given it was probably earth-shattering when it came out) It got a three because everyone will say ""You haven't the series yet?"""
2,NOT ENOUGH EXCITEMENT,I thought it started off ok but then it just went on and on and on and on. The story just was too complicated and it just was too hard too carry on reading it. The story is not exiting and i just could'nt escape in to it.I have asked some of my friends who have read it and they totally agree with me. I would hardley recomend it to anyone but if they like that sort of book good luck to them.
2,60's hippie wizard kid finds himself.,"The book is about a kid who becomes a wizard. Anti climatic from beginning to end. He is bullied and mocked, ends anticlimactically. He is tasked with dispatching a massive old dragon and its spawn, ends anticlimactically. He unleashes an evil on the world, spends half the book trying to bottle it up, ends anticlimactically. The character is not self absorbed, the story about him is. There is nothing epic about this story in the least, it could have been a biography about a kid who grows up to become an architect, and its about as interesting as that."
5,Quietly beautiful,"Rarely that one finds a book so simply written, yet so beautiful. The characters are not larger than life. A wonderful few hours of escaping reality. A very enjoyable read."
3,"An interesting series, but no comparison to the Hobbit","This series is fairly interesting. I would not recommend it for adults. I would recommend it for kids under the age of 14. The books are far too short, there is little plot or character development. Frankly I was disappointed at how the books related to each other, there were too many major gaps in the series. In reading a review that said: ""If you liked the Hobbit you will love these."" This is a poor characterization. These books are not even in the same league as Tolkien. They would be good books for kids just getting into fantasy, but for the veteran fantasy buff recommend Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series or Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn or something of the like. The premise behind the plots of these books is good but is not developed well."
3,Earthsea 1,"This is a classic book and with good reason. It takes the standard concepts good vs evil, becoming a better person or become the person you are meant to be; and Le Guin makes is it feel fresh and inviting you want to know more. The reason for only 3 stars is due to my personal bias of finding the writing style a bit cumberson. This will however not stop me from reading the rest of the series because I want to know Ged's journey."
2,Why do schools require these sort of books?,"This book kept trying to make me think about the power of language, the balance of good and evil,and being responsible. Because of those reasons, I wanted stop reading it at page34, but unfortunetly it was required for school. Why can't a book be both preachy and entertaining? The only time I sit down and ponder the theme of a book is when the story didn't need the theme and was just intresting itself.This book failed at that. The plot of this book is also lame. Its about a young powerfull wizard who unleashes something terrible unto the world and goes hunting after it. Nothing else happens except this part involving dragons."
3,Never finished it.,"I had heard high praise on this book from many people, so I thought I would give it a try. I am always up for reading a new book, whatever genre it may be. I started reading it. The plot was a little vague to begin with, but I can name a few good books that have a slow beginning, so I gave it the optimistic approach and continued reading. But it never picked up my attention. I always felt disconnected from the characters and plot, and I never felt that I knew anybody's personality. Important people died and people cried and villages were saved and burned, etc. I just didn't care. I felt that this was the story of some random person that I didn't need to be reading. But don't let my review scare you off from reading the book. Different people have different opinions. You might see some entertaining prospect of the book that I have not found, so have at it. Happy Reading."
3,"Good, though she's done better.","Ursula K. LeGuin, A Wizard of Earthsea (Atheneum, 1968)The first volume in LeGuin's celebrated Earthsea quartet, this volume follows Ged from his boyhood through his early years as a full-fledged wizard. (Those unfortunate enough to have watched the recent Sci-Fi Channel abomination will be rather surprised at a few key liberties the adapters took with the text.) I'm usually a huge fan of LeGuin's young adult work (Very Far Away from Anywhere Else was on my twenty-five-best list when I read it in 1997), but her tone here is a bit on the didactic side, a far cry from the natural prose she normally uses. Not that it'll keep me away from the other three in the series, as the characters are well-drawn and LeGuin laid her hooks for the next books quite neatly in a row in this one, but if you're new to the wonderful world of LeGuin, I'd suggest starting with one of the adult books before trying these out. ***"
5,see!,"I have nothing much to say, it's just very good book! It makes you think differently maybe see things differently. I don't know about others, but I like this trilogy very much."
3,"Enjoyable, until the very end","Tight, well-written piece of classic fantasy literature, but the ending was just completely deflating, wasting an entire book's worth of intense build-up."
2,Simple and Uninteresting,"This book was so unstimulating that i read in in one day just to be rid of it. The characters remain undeveloped as the very modest storyline unfolds itself. For readers of younger ages (10-12) this book would be very interesting because it poses no intellectual difficulties. It passes over months of the characters life with barely a word. It left me with a feeling of com,plete and utter lack of connection with the main character. The fact that someone would even compare this book to Tolkien let alone praising it over him is rediculous. I would actually reread sewctions of the book figuring i must have left out an entire chapter since seemingly important sections of a characters life were just passed by. I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13 unless you have an afternoon to waste."
2,Big disappointment,"I started this novel with a great deal of anticipation; I had read reviews, and seen this book on many fan lists, so I bought it.Usually, when I start the first book in a fantasy series, I spend many sleepless nights pouring through each sequel until I have finished the series. This is the first time I had no interest in finding out what happened in the subsequent books.The stories and characters were horribly underdeveloped. Neither were built up enough for me to even care about what happened to them. The entire approach to wizardry felt overly simplistic for the fantastic events that were supposedly happening.I haven't been this disappointed with anything since I saw Dungeons and Dragons (what a pile that thing was)."
3,Shallow,I found this a good fantasy beginning book but I really don't see what all the hype is about. It is the story of a young wizard coming of age. The characters and landscape are not fluffed out enough to get a good feel for them. Since this is a series I hope that the descriptions solidify in the next books.
2,pah! this is nothing compared to tolkien,"this book has such a lack of imagery and a weak predictible plot that it dosen't compare to tolkien's masterpiece. it's storyline is long and drawnout for a simple plot as a wizard who chased his shadow. all i can say is if you want something to read this is it but if you want a good fantasy worth your time try tolkien, terry goodkind, or brian jaques."
3,Like a Black-and-White Movie,"It was like reading a black-and-white movie. The book may have been special when it was released many decades ago, but it pales when compared to modern works from authors like Patrick Rothfuss and George R.R. Martin. The world around the main character is lifeless, and the ending is a disappointment. Also, the arc of the book is relatively simple and can be summed up as follows: Young wizard makes a bad mistake, young wizard runs from mistake and fails, young wizard defeats mistake by facing it head on. Good lesson, though: Don't run from your fears.The most interesting thing about this book is that it is a foundation upon which many other authors have built improved stories. Additionally, it appears to be the direct inspiration for Rothfuss' ""naming"" of things, i.e., that all things have a true name which is hidden and, if spoken by another, allow that thing to be controlled by the speaker."
2,Yawn...,"I really wasn't impressed with this novel. I found it lacking not only in action but also in depth, plot and meaning. I guess I'm just missing something, but to me it seemed like nothing happened, like I wasted a few good hours of my life that I could have spent drooling in front of the TV. I don't know why i kept reading through the third book, probably my misinterpreted view that there is to be a point to novels. Three books of short, shallow sentances that move the plot along at a snail's crawl. She introduces characters and then just forgets about them(Tombs of Atuan?) What was the second book for anyway? To prove he could hunt treasure and lure small girls from their homes? But I digress, the first book is a bore of epic proportions(despite being 150 pages) that track the misdemeanors of an ignoble youth who (SURPRISE!) eventually becomes the Archmage. I didn't even think it was written well..."
1,It STUNK!,"The book starts out kind of interesting, but then the plot grows so big and complex and just plain BORING! I would not reccomend this book to anyone."
1,"no good, very bad book!","this book was forced into my hands by my english teacher, and i couldn't stand it. i have to tell how ged was a hero, and that is stupid because he isn't! all the characters are vague, impersonable, and tedious. i think it should be against the law to make ordinary, self-respecting people read this over the summer! what a waste of time! fantasy is a thing that i cannot stand, but this made me hate it more so!"
1,Two different authors?,"The first three books are pretty good. Ranking amongst the best fantasy novels I have read.When I discovered Leguin continued the saga, I couldn't wait to get hold of the other three.What a disappointment it was. It looks like a completely different author. The first was a writer, a storyteller and a good one at that. The second one was a disgruntled feminist with the delusion she has writing abilities.The second three books differ from the first three as a cheap cowboy novel differs from Tolkien.By all means, do read the first three books. They are well worth it. But forget the last three. A phone directory makes more compelling and less biased reading."
2,good idea,"but too wordy. the power of names was interesting, and is often used in other fantasy novels as well. but this one was too boring. too much descriptions."
1,"Who compared this to ""The Lord of the Rings""?","After falling in love with Middle-Earth in Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"", I heard that Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea books were of the same caliber. Nothing could be further from the truth. This book was full of sullen, unsympathetic characters and the silliest dragons in the history of fantasy literature- dragons that you can defeat merely by calling their name. Moreover the book is obsessively concerned with the balance of magic- an interesting concept, but one which the author handles badly. The magic of Tolkien's Middle-earth is inherent in the characters- it's not what they do, but what they are. Compared to this the conflicting petty spells and name-calling in Earthsea are pretty disappointing"
3,A bit bland,"I recently read this book for the first time, and I feel that I was a bit too old or something. The book had some pace, but wasnt very colorful, descriptive or surprising. The ending was a bit predictable, as well as the late reappearance of Vetch. The book was thoroughly mediocre."
3,OK story. Nice world created,I found that the world created was very detailed. There was many explanations on how magic was used and regulated. It was not bad for a short book.The one thing I didn't like about it was that it did drag on a few areas. I began feeling like I was reading it just to finish it and be done. I will not be reading the following books either. The ending was a bit predictable and not as climatic as I thought it could of been. There was only 2 parts in the book where I was interested and then it was over in a matter of pages.The writing was not bad and it was easy to follow. Although the dialog lacked a bit. I felt like everyone spoke with the same mouth.
2,This book left me bored...,"I read this book for a scifi/fantasy lit class I was taking at the time. The teacher started off with this book because it was one of the first real popular fantasy books that was non-tolkien. I have varying tastes, but all I really desire in a fantasy book is enough detail to make the world feel real, characters that I can care about, and a unique story. This book seemed to be lacking all of those things. I guess it was just to simple for me, and too short to really get invested in the story. I believe it was written in the late 60s and you can really tell, it shows it's age compared to more modern fantasy. I haven't read any of LeGuin's other stuff, but one thing I do know, is that I just did not like this book at all. Also, stay away from the movie version, after watching that I suddenly didn't think the book was so bad."
2,SLEEPER!,I don't know about anyone else who read this book but I was having trouble staying awake reading it. It was boring to me. If you enjoy fantasy stories about wizards and strange magic this is for you. A fair warning: VERY SLOW PACED!
1,Not good.,"I'm sorry, but I have to say I didn't like this book at all. Which is really unusual, because I like a lot of books. But I didn't read all of it, I only got about 3/4 of the way through, and it bored me so much that I quit reading it. I don't usually do that. I was 13, but maybe that's too young. I don't think so, I've read books like Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice and some other harder books, and really liked them. Maybe if I feel like it I'll pick it up and try it again sometime."
1,"euthanasia, please, over this book","Ursula K. LeGuin -- genius, or Scotch warming pan? The distinction becomes blurred sixty pages into the book, when LeGuin decides to give your human sensibilities such a thorough rogering that you only wish you had run for magistrate of Gornoth Sector-7 to condemn the alien spice-fiend who has apparently taken over Ms. -LeGuin's- sensibilities to life in a boldronathian vector jumble. What in the name of heaven is Earthsea? Where is the plot? Has postmodernism become prehistoricism? This is not a book. It's words on a pages between two covers fashioned from the most typical of sci-fi novel cover-stock paper. LeGuin's writing is so poor that it seems to legitimise every Tor Science Fiction series novel every written, but as to exactly how, well, i'm not sure, but my guess it has something to do with the space-time continuum, hill-gnomes, and ""dark wizardry."" And vector jumbles. Rubbish."
1,1 down,Yes ...1 star ...I'd give it less if I could ...this was a very tedious read ...I don't know who anybody is ...not even the main character ...just a series of events ...felt like a long prologue....Well ...I'm going to attempt the next book wish me luck... just cause ...not sure if I'll make all the way though...
1,This Book is Absolutely Terrible.,"I was supposed to read this book in English class as an assignment back in 7th grade. We started it, and it was terrible! Every single person in our class thought so. We wrote a petition to our teacher saying we shouldn't read it, and so later she told us that, if every single person came in the next day with a paragraph persuading her to let us not read it, she would make us read something else. The next day, twenty-four long paragraphs flooded to her desk, telling about how boring, far-fetched, confusing, and badly written it was. So we didn't have to read it. We still talk about our teacher's terrible choice in reading assignments today! So please, don't bother with this book if you want something that will keep you even remotely interested."
1,Where Are The Negative Stars When You Need Them?,"I give this book five stars. No, wait, I mean negative five. I cried when I read this book. Seriously, I ran and sobbed in the closet for about half an hour; that's how much I hated it.There are much, much better fantasy stories out there. I'm very strict with myself about the integrity of my reading- that is, I don't allow myself to skip anything or skim over boring parts. Unfortunately, I realized after I was finished with AWoE, the whole novel was one enormous boring part and I should have flipped through the pages and called it a day.The author has somehow managed to turn an archetypal journey into an over-reaching, unsubtle literary disaster."
1,BORING,"This book is terrible for a child or for an adult. I read it in sixth grade and was bored out of my mind. I am an avid reader, and it was the first book my mother ever had to FORCE me to read so I could do a book report on it. I thought picking it up again when I was older would help (I am now 22). I was wrong- I still hate it."
4,It felt a little distant,"While LeGuin's prose is beguiling and her characters believable, somehow I felt a little more removed from the scene than I like to be when I'm reading a novel. I'm not sure why that is. I would have preferred to get more deeply inside the heads of the characters than I did. Otherwise, an excellent book - I felt that things were happening even without the bloody battles and lurid affairs that so often are used in fantasy novels in place of good writing to hold the reader's interest."
5,This book was one of the best fantasy books i've ever read.,"This was a great fantasy book from the beginning. After I read this book, I couldn't wait to read the sequels. This book is definitely in my list of top 5 books ever."
3,Wizard of Excitement and Snore,"The Wizard of Earthsea is a comming of age story that tracks the development of a young man. Earthsea has a plot that involves an internal good vs evil theme. Ged, the protagonist goes learns many lessons throughout this novel. First Ged must find his place in as a wizard. Ged is faced with issues that will force him to enter conflict about how to use his magic. Tricked to use his wizardry at an inappropriate time, Ged battles the evil side of himself. Ged must conquer the evil to bring a balance back to his world.Earthsea is interesting at the beginning but lags a little at the end. I enjoyed the book myself but It can be boring and slow moving, especially toward the end of the novel."
2,Where is the diologe?????,"This looked like the best book on my summer reading list. It wasn't. It is ok, but there is only about five pages of diologe in the entire book!!! It is like you are veiwing the plot from behind one of those mirrors that you can see through one-way. You have no insight to the charictors thoughts or feelings. This type of writing might be ok for a charictor that shows their thoughts by talking or actions. But sparrowhawk is so withdrawn that you can't tell anything about him. I was very disapointed."
4,One of my favorites,"I just love Ursula K. Le Guin's books. From Earthsea to the Hanish galactic chronicles, to the androgynous races in, The Left Hand of Darkness."
4,Just Great!,"Growing up with the Harry Potter series, I am so surprised that it took me so long to even hear of this writer and series, but I am glad I finally did. It is a wonderfully paced beginning to what proves to be a fantastic tale of Ged of Earthsea. It combines all the good stuff you would want in a fantasy; dragons, magic and dark shadows with the clean, rich and guiding (not pushing like some other series) writing that Leguin seems to be so good with. Just Great!"
5,I mean it when I say five stars.,I was forced to read this book for a literature elective and absolutely loved it. It is an awesome fantasy with a plot similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde but utterly unique. Le Guin gives her world a feeling of everyday reality as well as believable fantasy elements. This is one of the few books that I have found in which wizards can't do everything. She sets limits on what her wizards are able to do and they are logical understandable boundaries. I certainly recomend this book. I kept my copy.
3,A well done product,"A Hostage negotiator is set up by other cops.He uses his skills and knowledge to bring out the crooksby taking hostages and using the police system:sort of Russian roulette with a swat team.Not really believable in a practical sense, butthe plot makes for great drama, suspense and solves a mysteryat the same time. The acting is very good,I liked the movie."
4,Samuel L. Jackson is BAD!,This is what you have to do when you've been falsely accused. Sam and Kevin are good together.Great acting and Directing
4,Solid Jackson and Spacey,"This is by a far one of my favorites to pop in when I want some great acting and action. Good suspense and good story make this well worth your time. By far one of the greatest cop movies. When a few cops go bad, they try to cover up by casting dirt on a hostage negotiator portrayed by Samuel Jackson. When he realizes he is in over his head he takes hostages and calls for an outside negotiator, played by Kevin Spacey, he thinks is clean. He must then figure out a way to let Spacey in on what is going on without getting anyone killed in the process. I highly recommend purchasing this if you like police or detective movies."
4,JACKSON AND SPACEY SAVE THE DAY,"Powerful performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey fuel this intense, often excellent crime thriller. Jackson plays an ace negotiator who finds himself framed for the murder of his partner and extorting funds from the policeman's disability pensions. Overwrought with a desire to prove his innocence, Jackson takes several people hostage in the Internal Affairs division and requests fellow hotshot negotiator Spacey to deal with him on his terms. Gary Gray directs the fine cast with professional aplomb and elicits commendable performances from a fine supporting cast including David Morse, Paul Giamatti, the late J. T. Walsh, Ron Rifkin and Regina Taylor. The movie climaxes in a compelling confrontation where the viewer isn't sure what's going on.THE NEGOTIATOR is a fine example of good performances compensating for a sometimes derivative script."
4,Almost Great Except....,"This movie kicked butt, it would have been a five star winner except for the fact that I did not have a role in this film. I'm a good actor who does a great impersonation of Gabe Kaplan. Honestly though, I enjoyed this movie, the plot kept you thinking, and the action never let up. It was 2 hours of pure bliss and afterwards I gave my girl a kiss..."
4,Very entertaining!,I really like Samuel Jackson & Kevin Spacy-I enjoyed the storyline-it's not all violence and shock appeal like I expected. Worth seeing!
4,Edge of your seat thriller! Keeps you guessing till the end,This film is better than I expected it to be. The fine acting by Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey creates a tension which rivets one to the screen. A must see for action suspense fans!
4,Compelling performance and an unforgetable stroy!,"A great team work by Jackson and Spacey. You never know what is going to be next, who is good guy and who is bad. A lots of suprise and shock. On the other hand, too violant for young viewers, definitely not a family movie. But if you are an adult, watch it alone at mid night, you won't sleep again."
4,the best action film of the '90s,"this film is way under rated. It is a must have for any action movie lover, the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat, while the story keeps you guessing. Go Get IT!"
5,Heated and moves well,"I knew this movie before purchase. I like many of the movies Spacek and Jackson have done before. This movie combines ideas of what SWAT and negotiators do for a living. The plot does not seem feasible but I enjoy how quick and intense they kept the movie. I have been to Chicago and thought the movie gave a flavor of police work in the city. It is a ""guy"" movie, full of shooting, dying, and beatings. Keeps your testosterone flowing."
5,Awesome,"This movie is full of great suspence and action. you would not be bored with this one , i promise."
5,This movie was the bomb!,"This movie created a sense of nervous engery which I would consider a ""good thing"". I mean, it was very interesting the way both main actors portrayed their characters into a situation that could happen or has happened in society. It sort of put me in the perspective of what a negotiator would do at his/her profession or someone who has strong demands to harm or control a situation."
3,"this is one of samuel l. jackson,and kevin spacey's best","samuel l. jackson is one of my favorite actors along with al pacino,robert deniro,bruce willis,antonio bandares etc.., and kevin spacey is also an excellent actor especially in l.a. confidential.anyway this was an excellent thriller.its an irresistable mix of action,suspense,and a slight bit of comedy.***dtc#1"
2,Pass on this one..,"Yes, you have to ""dumb"" yourself down to like this one - as the director doesnt have an original idea in his head. Samuel Jackson's is miscast as he is expected to carry the movie and he has limited acting abilities - Kevin Spacey is a much better actor but seems bored. You'll find yourself chuckling over the silly dialogue but at 139 minutes you just want it to end."
2,In any business transaction there is a process,To do well you must learn how to negotiate. As we all know we don't negotiate with hostages.
2,Rusty and not Spacys best,I think this movie is ok but there are a lot of thing in this movie that I would change over again. This movie is flat and would have passed it up.
4,"Excellent actors, brilliant twist!","The acting was faultless. It was great to see that J.T. Walsh was still giving his finest up to the last. OK, so Kevin Spacey is my favourite actor, but I still think I'm objective enough to say that his timing was faultless. The comedic piece with his wife and daughter had me laughing out loud, as I could see my family there in a few years time! Samuel L Jackson is, as always, wonderful. The way he portrayed an honest man willing to go to any lengths to prove his innocence was great. these two should work together again! The other scene that will stay with me is the faces of the cops outside the house. But the best part for me, with all the tremendous acting aside, was the outstanding twist at the end. I never saw it coming. Kevin Spacey deserves the romantic lead he's looking for; if he can act action hero he can do anything!!"
5,intense and action packed movie,Very good movie that kept you tied to your seats. I would recommend this one.
4,Spacey and Jackson match wits in a near-great thriller,"Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson are two of the best actors working today, and they're the two main reasons to see The Negotiator. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, too. The plot stretches credulity more than once, but I was delighted by some of its twists that I didn't see coming."
3,Spacey and Jackson make great chemistry despite...,"...much of the film, especially the cliche'd beginning and tacked-on ending, fizzling direly. Although well-acted, the movie's plot was quite thin and the ending was predictable and rather expedient. Samuel L. Jackson and his ""negotiator"" counterpart Kevin Spacey are extremely talented actors who did the best they could with the tame but (to give the writer the benefit of the doubt) otherwise well-written script. But their talents could have served a greater capacity if only for the lack of cheap ""cops and bad-guys"" cliches added on at seemingly the last minute. Starting off as adversaries, they end up making a great team, especially with Spacey, normally mild-mannered in his acting portrayals, playing the part of a hardline tough guy. Worth a watch but not an Oscar winner."
5,Kept my interest all the way through,Kevin Spacey has another top role here and doesn't disappoint. Lots of action and excellent 6 speaker sound effects on the DVD.
5,Finally Something Fresh,"I saw this film twice this summer, and it never ceased to amaze me. In an average summer, we don't get to see to see two such extraordinary actors (Samuel L. Jackson & Kevin Spacey) go head to head. It serves up a lot of action and thrills, with plenty of smarts to match. This film is definitely a ""must see"" on my list."
2,"NOT Usual Suspects, L.A. Confidential, Jackie Brown","Considering the acting talents of both Jackson and Spacey, this movie was extremely disappointing; it would have been a decent straight-to-Cinemax-at-2a.m. movie. The script was painfully trite. Save your time and watch the original Die Hard."
2,"""The Negotiator"" boring and plotless","The first reason I didn't like this was because there were about a dozen four-letter words per sentence. I am a teenager in high school, not an overprotective parent, and the profanity was so frequent that it lowered the entertainment level dramatically. It got to the point of extreme annoyance. Samuel L. Jackson was miscast. He isn't a bad guy with his reputation. Nothing ever seemed to develop. All it showed was the criminal in a building with hostages chit-chatting with the police, while the lives of the people involved in this took a dramatic turn. THAT IS JUST AMAZING. The folks who wrote the script sure have an imaginative mind to think this up(sarcasm). There have been billions, it seems, of movies about the same topic. This is just one of the many. Not to mention, it is way too long and drawn out. Terrible."
1,One was practically empty. Others lasted too short,The only cartridge problems I had in my life. Something is wrong. It is cheap but maybe not worth it.Volkan AkkurtTRY THIS ONE:Canon PG-210XL Cartridge (Black) in Retail Packaging
3,Okay,"This product worked fine in my HP Photosmart 2575 printer, but it didn't last for very long. Of course, it is much less expensive than the standard inkjet cartridge.I probably won't buy another one, though. I give it an okay rating. It does the job, but doesn't last long."
5,"You will not be dissapointed, try it","I was not much of a fan ofthe music of Edgar Varese;until I decided to give ita try. I tell you, that Ireally enjoyed what I heard.I think that the works recordedhere are superb. I belive thatthese is some of Varese's earlyworks composed in New York, exeptfor ""Deserts"" that was first heardin Paris in 1954 under the batonof Pierre Boulez who in this recordingdoes a wonderful job conducting theChicago Symphony Orchestra.""Ionization""a work for 13 percussion instrumentsis the shortest on this program, andis one of my favorites. I think thatthis is a highly recommended CD especiallyfor those who have not tried the music ofVarese, which in it self is sohard to describe."
5,awesome,"THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DEATHMETAL RELEASES OF ALL TIME! THIS IS IMMOLATION'S FINEST MOMENT IN TIME. OTHERS BASH IT FOR ITS COMPLEXITY. WELL, DEATHMETAL SHOULD BE COMPLEX, TALENTED. IT MAKES OTHER BANDS THINK ABOUT THEMSELVES. THIS IS IMMOLATOIN'S MOST HEARTFELT, MELODIC AND EMOTIONAL RECORD. OH, AND LEST WE FORGET, IT HAS SHEER BRUTALITY ALL OVER IT ALSO. ROSS DOLAN AND CO. HAVE DONE IT THIS TIME, PUSHING THE CONVENTIONAL DEATH BOUNDARIES TO NEW BETTER EXTREMES, FORCING OTHERS TO PLAY BETTER. GET THIS ALBUM BEFORE ANY OTHER IMMOLATION, OR AS A MATTER OF FACT, BEFORE ANY OTHER BAND, EXCEPT MAYBE SUFFOCATION!"
5,here in after,This is a taste of the early immolation.ROSS sounds great plus original drummer here.Very good.
2,So sad,Her first album was beyond brilliant. The second showed great depth. Her third suggests she needs better management.
1,Broadway Type,"She sounds like a Broadway trained actress trying to sing jazz. She just does'nt make it. Her vibrato is much too wide for a jazz singer. Forget this one, unless you like the Broadway Effect"
5,Love it!,Always listen to this CD when things dont seem to be going my way and it perks me right back up.
3,a nice cd,"this is a fine cd. the arrangements are terrific. i thought some of the song selections stray from the idea presented in the pictures and make the presentation slightly uneven. nevertheless,a wonderful performance from ms. mcdonald."
3,not bad...but not great,"As in previous recordings, we get technical flawlessness here...great tone and diction...but McDonald continues to lack in engaging phrasing. With all her talent, she definitely ""plays"" better live. The sterility of the recording studio does not suit her...how's about a live concert album??? On the stage she's all fire and music, but only flickers here.What we want: storytelling a la Barbara Cook. What we get: the student from Master Class.The program is interesting and a fun departure from McDonald's more cerebral previous recordings, but as in those, I couldn't help wishing while I was listening to this record that I was instead sitting at Joe's Pub hearing her perform.If you're an Audra fan you'll like this, if you're new to her this won't convince...catch her in performance first. It'll be interesting to see how her recording style evolves."
1,Not Leisure Life As Before,It's now a National Label. Fabric is thinner. Quality is no longer there. Really a shame! The Almost-Identical one I ordered before has the Leisure Life label and is a 5-Star quality. I returned the one with the National label.
5,Excellent work,Very insightful; I would recommend it to friends and co-workers (and I have purchased copies for colleagues).
5,Best book you can read on human behavior,"This book is more digestible and practical than any book I've read on human behavior. While other tools like Myers-Briggs and Predictive Index are excellent resources, The Human Fabric's 'MRE' framework is a quick read and easier to apply to everyday life. It will positively impact your relationships with coworkers, friends, and your spouse. Buy it...I did. In fact, I bought 20 copies to give away!"
5,Good book for understanding people and the world around you,"A wonderful book and a very interesting read. Bijoy does a great job of tying together modern management, eastern philosophy, and social sciences to provide a rather simple yet powerful framework for understanding and relating to people. This book is a must read for managers and team leaders.Manoj Saxena"
2,Two in the Far North,"Parts of this book were very interesting and I respect the woman and the adventurous lifestyle, but parts were dated for me and other parts were too long. I do not think that is was well told."
2,Looks Fun!,"I saw this toy online, and I definitely wanna get one. I really like to do makeovers, but my mom won't ever let me give her one - I mean, you can wash it right off! She just refuses anyway. That's why I wanna get this toy; so I can do makeovers by myself! Doing things like this is an opportunity for me to show my great creativity."
2,WEIRD!,"This item looks creepy - it's a face sticking out of a container! I would definitely get a styling HEAD with a body, not a styling FACE in a makeup compact."
3,Surprisingly Good,"I'm not usually a Pierce Brosnan fan but after I got over my initial doubts about him playing a Native Indian like character, I actually started to really get into this movie. Maybe it is somewhat romanticized but the underlying message of this film is more Important than ever.It was a refreshing change from other movie genres...I especially liked the Baby Beavers who are super cuteA must for animal and nature lovers-D"
4,A little grey around the owl,"The scenery is beautiful and the acting is excellent but the storyline left a little to be desired. In some instances the story seems slow moving and bogged down a bit in impressionistic nuances. The ending was disappointing, . . though inevitable I suppose. I enjoyed the movie but would not recommend it as a ""must see"" to anyone else."
3,good acting but not enough meat in the script,Pierce Brosnan did a good job as well as others in this movie. However the script didn't have any meat. It was like a short story. Seeing Pierce Brosnan naked was worth it!
3,Could of been done better........,"I am very fimiliar with the story of Grey Owl as I grew up in Northern Ontario not far from Chapleau, where Grey Owl lived at one point in his life.It was a average documentary about the Ojibway guide and trapper in the 1920s Canada. Grey Owl aka Archie is different from his fellow Indians - he is well versed, educated, and a brillant writer. Grey Owl eventually becomes a voice for the mindless exploitation of wild places and animals. Only until he goes to England does his past come back to haunt him.I agree with the other reviewer that Richard Attenborough decided too ""clean up"" Grey Owl's image. Grey Owl is a very important part of Canadian history and conservation, however the movie could of been done better...."
2,Not a movie for animal lovers!,The fox was really trapped and killed. There was no disclaimer in the end credits stating no animals were harmed during filming. That scene ended my(albeit fleeting) enjoyment of this sub par movie. I had no interest in seeing any more animals being killed.
2,Won't play in the US?,I ordered this for my mother in the USA but it would not play on her DVD. She is sending it to me to see if it will work on mine. So I don't know why.
3,no mention of .....,"in all the reviews i read, there is no mention that Grey Owl is in fact NON-NATIVE, HE'S BRITISHthis movie leaves out some very important aspects in Belaney's life, but if your looking for the truth about Belaney, then there are other places you can go for that information.its alright that he chose to become a conservationist, but did he have to represent himself as native to get his voice heard?at the same time, i'm told that being native is a way of life.if your just looking for a lax movie with excellent scenery and music, then by all means, fill your boots."
2,Pierce Brosnan...as an Indian...enough said...,"This is not a good movie. I saw it in my U.S. History class and struggled to stay awake. I'm a history major and love all things dealing with history, but again, this was not a good movie. I didn't particularly enjoy the plot, but what really brought the movie down was the fact that the cinematography could have been much better. If you're into white guys dressing up like Indians try ""The Last of the Mohicans"" instead."
5,Wonderful Halloween Viewing!,This video is an absolutely adorable children's cartoon. The sound effects and voice overs are primitive but that only adds to it's charm. Highly recommended as a halloween treat for young children.
4,A Classic!,"I remember this one from my childhood. VERY cute. We taped it (off of TV) and watched it over, and over again.I have never seen it for sale on video. It's a rare find."
1,Not compatible with XP - Not able to Play Game,My daughter plays this game on an archaic computer (windows 98). We wanted to upgrade the game to play on newer computers. I specifically bought this game because it was advertised as being able to run on XP. We eagerly loaded the game when we received it and were saddened by the fact that it wouldn't run (although it installed with no problems). Haven't been able to overcome the compatibility issues as of yet. My daughter is very disappointed!
1,No stars. Still reads like he wrote it 30 years ago,"While Reuben has toned down his patently anti-gay bias, his ""I'm just telling it like it is"" attitude is still just thinly veiled and self-congratulatory ignorance. You have to wonder if he's ever met any gay people in his life. He certainly hasn't met any happy ones. That may be his experience, but he's doing a disservice to us all--gay and straight--by generalizing his experience to all gay people. If you're gay, look up this book by Peter Shalit, M.D. instead: ""Living Well: The Gay Man's Essential Health Guide"". It's everything that Reuben's book should have been."
1,Disgusting Garbage,"This book is the most dangerous piece of garbage I have ever seen. When I was 16, and coming out of the closet in 1985, I read this book.Good thing I was raised correctly, and knew not to trust this nonsensical ""expert"" on what gay life is. Now, at 36 years old, my curiosity was piqued yet again, sort of like smelling bad milk, or gawking at a car accident.If I was a person filled with hate, I would hate the opportunist that ""wrote"" this ""book"". However, I only hate the book.If you're gay, coming out, or having any doubts about yourself, and you decide to read this book, please ignore it and trust yourself. You are more important that this piece of garbage.Thank you."
1,He hasn't changed,"This book, when it first appeared, became one of the most damaging and injurious books of the 20th century. Reuben's ignorant, false lies about gays and lesbians were read or heard about just about everyone, and caused a lot of pain. Pain to me, who beleived what he said, pain to my mother, who beleived it. How sad his book became a cultural phenomenon.I really don't have much of an opinion about his other topics, but he seems very narrow minded and judgmental and self important. There are undoubtedly some good things in this book, but you can find the same information elsewhere.In this new edition he has toned things down a bit, but this is, after all 2002.I do not recommend this book to anyone for any reason."
1,Homophobia Resurrected,"In the early 1970's I read the first edition of this book. The chapter relating to gay mens' sexuality was simply error filled, mean spirited and focused on impersonal bathroom sex. It was with some trepidation that I read this unneeded resurrection. Of course my worst fears were confirmed. In this enlightened age this so called ""sex expert"" continues to portray gay men as sex obsessed denizens of bathrooms and bathhouses. There is no attempt to convey the idea that gay men might love each other and care for each other while making love. His thesis that male-male sex is some how limiting is preposterous. What was the publisher thinking when they resurrected this homophobic tripe?"
1,Bigitory is alive and well in USA,"Amazon should give us the opportunity to award NO STARS ... What a silly, ill-informed monster of a book... I've got a copy of the original 1969 edition and it is immersed in hatered, misinformation and observations that are laughible at the extreme... It is almost acceptable to hold such views and ill-concieved thoughts 30 years ago... but in 1999??? And not only is the chapter on ""Male Homosexuality"" so stragne.. the rest of the booklet is also so unbalanced, confused and missing any accurate basis for informing readers for a heathly sex knowledge."
1,Who let this guy publish again??!,"This book is full of uninformed, bigoted, and downright stupid ideas about queer people, folks who are into kink, and pretty much anyone who isn't into soft-focus vanilla heterosexual sex. This may be an update compared to the idiocy of the old book, but it is certainly not worthy of 90's adults."
1,An odious book,"It may be 1999, but you'd never know it from this horrible book, supposedly ""updated."" In this new edition, Reuben STILL paints a picture of gay people as promiscuous and incapable of forming lasting relationships. Sure, some are--but then, so are some straight people. To portray all gay people this way is as wrong and hateful as depicting all black people as murderers. The book does, though, go some way to explaining where homophobia and homohatred come from."
1,I wouldn't even give it the one star,"My own opinion is that the book was meant to scare people away from ever having sex. It gives a first impression of being open-minded, but really, its message is to never have sex, because bad things might happen to you. Some of it seemed to be very close to urban myth territory. What I remember the most, though, were the fright stories about back-alley abortionists and women who died trying to abort an unwanted pregnancy. I don't remember much about the author's ideas about homosexuality, but for the most part I wouldn't take anything he had to say about sex seriously. Reading it again, it just seems to be a modern version of the moral hygiene pamphlets from the early part of the 20th century."
1,Snotty stuffy tonalities which turn me off,"I rented a copy of this book from my local library. I was not happy with what I found. Throughout this book the author uses a know it all ""snotty nosed"" tone to everything he says. It's really irritating. One particularly good example of the bad nature of this book is on the back dust jacket that comes with the hard cover eddition. It says ""how a man can actually grow a new foreskin and why he shouldn't."" Then in the relevant section in the book he goes on to state that circumcision is merely an option open to parents. This is an abusive and absurd view. If you want to know anything about how to be sexually turn off and repulsed and angred, and how to get a sick feeling in your stomach, go ahead and get this book."
1,"Oh, please","I read this book when it first came out 30 years ago. I decline to spend good money on the updated version because updated crap is still crap. It was a best-seller then because Dr. Reuben hit on a winning formula. Tittilating information (in the 60's, sex was just starting to be openly discussed), a chatty, non-clinical format that relaxed the nervous reader(most of us in those days)and a medical degree to give it respectability, Great except for one thing, Dr.Reuben knew nothing of his topics. He had no psychiatric training(California law allowed any MD to hang a psychiatrist shingle) My favorite idiocy was the notion that syphillis and gonorrhea could be eliminated by giving everyone mandatory injections of penicillin. Brushing aside the civil liberties issue, I can't think of a better way to develop a nice vicious drug-resistant strain of these diseases. The book is enjoyable only as a reminder of how gullible we were 30 years ago."
1,Dangerously Misleading,"I first read this book in the early 1970s and it influenced me in that it delayed my gender transition and eventual sex change surgery by 20 years. When I recently found an updated version in the local library I checked the section on Transsexuality to see if it had been corrected or updated.What I found was laughably misinformed, out of date, and badly biased. If the rest of the book is as poorly and badly written as this section, then it will cause a great deal of misery for a lot of people, which it could have otherwise have helped."
1,Disgusting!,This book should be banned because it offends millions of people and reinforces prejudice about the LGBT people.
3,"Broke many barriers, but some parts are inaccurate.","I read the original version of this book as a curious teenager. I became the envy of the neighborhood with my ability to answer my school chums ""dirty"" questions. This book was a very important release that shocked prudes everywhere and flew off the bookshelves at the same time. Alot of the information was factual, but alot was biased, especially about gay people. This certainly had an impact on America's homophobia in general. Still, I'm thankful I had this book to learn from when young instead of the lies and misinformation when you ""learn"" about sex like all the guys did."
5,This book saved my marriage,"This is more of a testimonial than a review but after 16 yearsof marriage and two children my sex life was hell! My husband and Iread this book together and found all the answers to our problems. We put our sex back together again and I guess our marriage to. This is truly the users guide to sex, relationships and sensibilities. Thank you Dr. Reuben and God bless you."
1,Not if you appreciate tools...,"I wanted a set of small wrenches for quick access when off-roading. I didn't need Snap-On quality, but I didn't want disposable tools either. These wrenches are of poor quality, the shanks are curved in some cases, the thickness varies from wrench to wrench, and the hand finishing is carelessly done. They do not even look like a ""set."" if you found them in the $1.97 tool bin at your local auto parts store, you would think they were over-priced. I picked up a set of Craftsman ""evolv"" brand at Sears for very little more money. Much nicer tools. They look like Snap-On compared to the Tekton."
1,"BUY HIS LATEST CD ""SOLEDAD"" INSTEAD","I have to admit .... what prompted me to buy Obispo's ""Superflu"" was his latest album ""Soledad"".I bought ""Soledad"" first. The songs on ""Soledad"" definitely sound sexier and believe it or not, he sounds sexier too!I listened to ""Superflu"" once or twice, took it out of my CD player ..... and it's now collecting er, dust. It had nearly put me to sleep. Snore.I'm still listening to ""Soledad"" and it must be 20, 30, 40 times already maybe?"
2,Awful,"A bastardization, this play attempts to capture the feel of Orwell's classic novel, and it fails miserably. It omits essential points of the plot and abridges several of the more important moments-- such as when Julia and Winston fall in love (a mere 1/4 page of the script). More importantly, because theater cannot ""enter the internal thoughts"" of characters as easily as books can (and this play has no monologs or soliloquies of that sort), the responsibility to imagine Winston's feelings lie wholly with the audience. George Orwell makes Room 101 real and terrifying; the play makes it a mockery. I would highly reccomend against this dramatization. I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because as a completely original play, it's OK. But, audiences will expect something of the caliber of Orwell's book, and this will leave them disappointed."
5,There's plenty of new stuff here but why the initial re-hash?,"The first 17+min is a review of 'Creative Force'. We -have- the other DVD if we need a review! // Pat isn't the greatest teacher: His riffs contain notes that aren't explained by the theories being discussed, his language is obtuse, & tho it's impressive, it's not instructive to hear so much unexplained riffing between comments. SO WHY FIVE STARS? To witness the thought process of a guy who plays so damn well! Jimmy Bruno & Robert Conti are two -top- players who are -much- more in tune with educational methods & language, but, to be blunt, they don't play as well as Martino. Is the difference here, in this DVD? I hope so, I think so, & I hope to to grasp it: Skip to c52min for some awe-inspiring single note instruction."
3,Walking with Christ DFD3,DFD3 WALKING WITH CHRIST is an excellent study guide for deepening your relationship with Christ.It provides an in depth bible study along with thought provoking questions designed to increase intimacy with Christ.
5,Nearly the same as Audiovox Sirius SRS PNP2 Compatible with Audiovox Boombox and Home Kit,"This Jensen JamPack Portable Sirius Satellite Radio System is nearly the same as Audiovox Sirius SRS PNP2 Compatible with Audiovox Boombox and Home Kit. The Audiovox company owns Jensen.The PNP2 is a great unit and this one looks just like it, except it's a different color. Reports here at Amazon are that this Jensen JamPack works with the Audiovox Sirius accessories for the PNP1 and PNP2 receivers. The JamPack has all the same buttons and layout as the PNP2.So if you need a Booombox look for the Audiovox BB1 and if you need a home dock, look for the Audiovox Sirius SIR-HK1A or SIRHK1A right here at Amazon marketplace."
1,missized waist,"Hello,Seams that every time I try to buy lined jeans the waist sizes are mis marked. If you take a tape measure and measure the waist opening it is 2 inches smaller that the label. I ordered size 312 waist but it measured 30.Dennis"
1,terrible company,"This company has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I ordered a Christmas present from them on Dec.9, and by Dec 21 I still hadn't received it. I checked my Amazon account to find out my order had been cancelled by the company. When I called to find out, they said someone that lived at my address before me never paid their bill and they refused to ship to my address-even though I had already paid for the jeans! After a 45 minute phone call (mostly being put on hold), the supervisor was going to reorder them but then told me they were no longer in stock. I was extremely upset to find out 3 days before Christmas, esp. when I ordered them 3 weeks before when they were in stock. So, buyers beware! You never know if the person that lived in your house before you paid their bill!"
5,Frederic (the great) Chiu,"Chiu's playing of these Etudes and the accompanying Chopin pieces on this CD are gorgeous. His astounding virtuosity, along with his intelligent expression and pianistic coloration should be a delightful experience for anyone who enjoys Chopin's music. We owm many of Chiu's recordings and have twice heard him in person in the Syracuse area, where some local pianists refer to him as ""Frederic the Great."""
1,"Good movie, poor quality DVD","It's Love Again is a very enjoyable film starring the fabulous Jessie Matthews. She shines throughout, and the story is very entertaining, but this is a review about this particular DVD release itself (Synergy Entertainment, 2010). For your money you will be getting a DVD-R featuring an unrestored version of the film complete with specks, dust, flickers and an audio track half drowned out by static. My copy doesn't even play all the way through, and freezes with about 15 minutes to go.To make matters worse, someone else I know bought this same release just a few days after me and he reported that the movie itself isn't even complete. Apparently this release has a couple of scenes missing, which are in his version on VHS!I dearly want a decent copy of this film, so I hope some other company will do a better job at some point in the near future."
2,Favourite Jessie Matthews film - Dreadful print,"This 1936 Britsh Gaumont film directed by Victor Saville and staring the fabulous Jessie Matthews is my absolute favourite of all her films and I was elated to find this for sale on Amazon USA.Unfortunatly this print has about five minuits cut from it,scenes missing and the rumba dance number with Cyril Wells cut in the middle.The print and sound track are of a very poor quality.Thankfully as a huge fan of Miss Matthews I have both a VHS copy and one recorded to a blank DVD disk purchased from someone on Ebay UK.Miss Matthews was an enormous blinding star in the 30's please would some company release all of her films on DVD - NOW! The only saving grace of this purchase for me was the art work on the case."
2,Very poor print,The quality of this dvd was very poor. The video was scratchy throughout the movie and the quality of the sound was poor as well. Also this is not a complete print as one scene was missing and another was cut short. Thankfully I have this movie on VHS (which is a great print and the movie is complete). This is a great movie but the quality of the dvd makes the movie less enjoyable.
4,Good Product,"I bought these pants to wear running in the winter and ended up wearing them when i went skiing a lot. I wore them under my ski pants and they kept me warm.They keep you at a good temperature, not too cold, not too warm.However, DO NOT PUT THESE IN THE DRYER. I accidently put these in the dryer with all of my other clothes and now parts of the material are melted together. I can't wear them anymore because they are melted. I am planning on buying a new ones."
3,"More like long underwear, less like leggings....","I am a little disappointed in this purchase. In the photo, they look like they are solid, black leggings, but upon opening the box, they are waffle-like patterned, identical to long underwear. I understand I purchased them for skiing, but thought based on the other reviews that they would be of a more versatile use (under skirts, to the gym, etc). So, I am giving them a 3 star review because it is highly unlikely that I will ever wear these pants unless they are for the pure purpose of warmth, i.e. while tail-gaiting at a football game, I will wear them under jeans, when I ski, etc. I am curious as to why no one else commented on this fact?"
2,defective,"The stitching was defective and left a small area unseamed. Decided to keep them because they are out of stock and for the amount I paid, they aren't bad after a bit of patching up. They do come up to my belly button (I'm 5'2""), so the woman modeling them in the picture must be much taller. They also get quite baggy after wearing but return to shape after washing. They do run big but not as bad as most other brands I have tried. I have an x-small, and I weigh 110 lb."
5,Every CD Julie Dexter has put out; I recommend that you purchase!,"Julie Dexter has also done concerts with a group called Fertile Ground. Make it your business to buy both if you can. Drum beats, reggae vibes, and sultry sounds all included in the Conscious CD. This is a great buy."
5,Very Nice,Julie's a smooth operator. This is a very nice CD of her work. She's as good on CD as in person. Enjoy it.
4,a real surprise,I had never heard about julie before I found her on amazon.And this album is a big and pleasant surprise!
1,Very Disappointed.,"After listened to the samples of the songs I was not that excited about the music. I still purchase this CD anyway based on Amazon reviewers that gave rave remarks. I thought maybe there was much more to this music than the samples would allow me to hear, so I purchased it and was very disappointed. Every song sounds the same, showing no creativity.I should have just listened to the samples to make my decission and never made the purchase."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I purchased this CD for my girlfriend who loves neo-soul and we both disliked this CD. The songs are flat and not well delivered. I went on the advice of positive reviews which was a mistake because I should have also read the negative reviews before making my purchase. I would recommend Ledisi-Lost & Found, she has a song entitled ""In the Morning"" a real chart making hit for neo-soul. All tracks on that CD are excellent."
2,not as good as the first,"I listened to ""Piece of Mind"" religiously for almost two years. It never left my disc changer. ""Concious"" has two or three notable songs. But it does not have the consistency of ""Piece of Mind."" She seems to be aiming for commercial success. She does not take as many risks with this one and there is too much filler."
1,Knuck For Young Buck,"this cd is wack and there a bunch of 14 and 15 year olds who try to imitate lil jon's style and the crunk style and is really annoying as hell and its too commercial and retarded, so knuck for young buck!"
1,Lacking in Quality,"I first received a Cross pen for Christmas about six years ago, and it was one of the best presents I have ever received. I loved it so much I've tried to hunt down a similar version, which led me to this item.Cross is no longer the icon it once was. Starting from the casing of this pen - it is cheap, almost plastic-like as opposed to the delightful housing of my original Cross pen, that has just the right amount of heft to it. The finish in real life is sadly no where close to as classy as the one pictured. It is a travesty that it is marked at $40, as it is not even worth the $25 I paid for it at Amazon. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in the difference in quality between my old and new cross pens."
4,hMMMMMM,I liked this one better than the newer ones....not as crude but my Stepson doesn't seem to enjoy it as much as the newer ones....unfortunately :(
2,for Lucas,"present for my son ... came in time, great condition, but I DON'T LIKE SNL ... my son does"
2,disappointed,"I guess it might have been funny then, but now it's lame so its not the product, but the reviewer I guess. I dont know what it is, but the SNL cast on it are obviously nervous, new, and not comfortable. It is very odd to see them this way versus my memory where they were comfortable, add-libbing, and natural."
5,SNL Forever!,"I love Saturday Night Live and I am proud to finally have the complete seasons of the first five years of the show; I guess I could say they were the best 5 years of the show even though there are so many magically hilarious highlights in the following years even to this day. Between the hosts, musical guests, original skits, satirical commercials and Mr. Bill, I am so happy to have these 5 complete seasons in my hands to watch anytime."
2,the memories seemed funnier!,"Sure, I was a teenager when this season was first broadcast, so I have to rack it up to changing tastes. This season (haven't gotten the others yet) was really disappointing. There were some laughs here and there, but otherwise no funnier than a bland episode of the current season. It's neat to see things I haven't seen since the 70's (and actually remember them!) still, this season leaves you wanting something funnier. Other reviews say this was the weakest of the first five seasons (once the first season found its footing)so I'll try another year or two. You may want to start with one of the other years first - I've read the third or fourth are the best. One great thing here is the audition by Andy Kaufman. The lowest points are always the Gary Weiss movies."
4,Complete shows? So-So. No commercial bumpers in the set!,"I've received the advanced copy on 11/19/2007 ""for review purposes only"" from Broadway Video. And I'm sorry to say that the commercial bumpers are NOT INCLUDED in the Second Season Box Set. I didn't look at all the shows in this set, but I can tell you that some of the shows are NOT complete. One good example would be......The Karen Black episode doesn't have the LIVE ""goodbye"" close at the end. What BV did was recreated a credit close with stills from the show open.However, the infamous Candice Bergen/Frank Zappa Christmas episode DOES HAVE the full, uncut skating rink goodnight in this set.In all, minus a couple of edited episodes and commercial bumpers, it's still a good box set and a must have for die hard SNL fans!"
5,live center,Works great. Now I can get really close with whatever chisel I'm using. Should have bought one sooner. I recomend.
2,backing plate unscrews,"Not overly pleased with this item. While it seems secure, the backing plate has unscrewed itself twice and I am not just leaving it off, though this allows contamination f\through the back recess. This does not seem to make a performance difference yet, but I think it will in time."
4,Psi live center #2 m.t.,Very nice for the price. Seems to be well constructed. Works well. Over all upgrade to my lathe. Timely shipping. Thank you psi.
2,poor bearings,Price was good maybe too good. It makes noise and is alittle rough running. I do use it alittle but I think calling it heavy duty will not hold up. Would not recommend for anything but very light use.
4,Toughness,"As received, the bearing was a bit rough, but smoothed right out after a few minutes turning. Only complaint is the softness of the steel....tools will cut it if not careful when working close to it, but this does not affect good performance of the center. Will buy another for second lathe."
3,Does the job seems prone to rusting,"Well,This is a live center, and it is much better than the Black one that comes free with a Jet lathe so it is definitely an upgrade. Bearings are smooth enough for woodturning. Taper seems smooth and straight. This thing rusts though, I mean it rusts fast! I keep paste was on this and it still rusts, so basically this requires a weekly cleanup with 400 grit paper and waxing. I wish it was not so rust prone, maybe a coat of black oxide would help or something."
5,live center,"This is an excellent live center, and the price is unbelieveable. I would recommend it for anyone wanting a great live center."
4,Decent live center,"I've been using this for a bit turning a bunch of wood products. I do utilize wet sanding on some products. There's been minimal oxidation on this. I suspect that the oxidation was because I might not have wiped down the live center like i do the bed, but a little sanding and wax and it's good to go."
4,lathe center,"PSI LCENTLT2 No. 2MT Heavy Duty Live Lathe Centereverything was as it should be the price ,shipment and the product"
3,Live Tail Center,"This live tail center is very nicely made. However I am only giving it 3 stars because the bearing doesn't feel as smooth as it should. When you hold it in your hand and spin the head, you can feel an uneveness as it rotates around. There doesn't seem to be any play though. On the lathe it appears to work fine, but I would be happier if it was smooth rotating."
5,Another good PSI Bargain,"I bought this for pen turning to prevent my other live centers from getting dulled. It is a nicely made live center, but I have to admit I have used it very little so I can't say how well it will hold up."
2,Not one for the guys,"Way too much discussion of wardrobes on the female characters. If you are looking for a Lawrence Sanders clone ,forget about it... as a former Palm Beacher I enjoyed some of the authors comments about local lore. Not a riviting thriller and pushes the envelope way too far in the bizarre nature of the nefarious deeds. Save your money guys,this is one for the babes."
3,Good but needs up to date info,"Good but didn't explain much of the stuff needed for plumbers license. I still think it is a great study material but wouldn't just count on it alone, I would definitely have another study reference."
3,Unread at this time,This book won't be used till winter so can't review at this time. Thank youShould be able to enter ? or 0 on your scale if necessary
5,Top of the Line,"At 17 months old, my son has and incredibly large vocabulary and I credit this video for much of it. The content is incredible, entertaining and packed with an enormous amount of age appropriate information. My son will hardly sit for any other video or movie, but is glued to this one the whole time."
2,did i miss something??,"i'm seeing all these rave reviews for this dvd, but i thought it was pretty lame. i realize the dvd wasn't targeted towards me, but even my 18 month old seemes to agree with me. the ""tummy tots"" are irritating to say the least, and i don't really care for the way that she introduces the different words. the baby einstein videos seem to be more effective and my son definitely enjoys them more...maybe i should watch this one again with my son and see if there's something we missed.....???"
1,Horrible,"This DVD was painfully bad. It looked like someone created it in their garage and the content was weak. If you're used to DVDs like ""Baby Einstein"" or even ""Baby Babble"", you're unlikely to be satisfied with this."
1,I got the wrong product,I got the wrong product. It's a Dior perfume but don't like the smell at all. 1st time I ever got wrong item
5,Hypnotic poison by Christian Dior Awesome Fragrance,This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE perfume!!!! I also wear poison which I love as well but not as much as this one.It never NEVER FAILS to get complemented on!!! I can almost guarantee you that when you wear this fragrance somebody will ask you what you are wearing and tell you it smells great!!!! This one is a winner. I save this perfume for special occasions when I want to feel extra special.
1,Received a copy not original,"I love Hynotic Poison! I've been wearing it for years; drawback is it's expensive. I purchased my last bottle from Amazon, which was $5 cheaper than the web site I normally buy from. What I purchased was a copy, smell a little lighter (original stays with you longer), bottle didn't have gold ring on neck, cap didn't fit. I took the cap off of my bottle that was almost empty and trashed the bent one. Bottle is darker, lettering was plainer. I am still angry that I paid full price for a duplicate. I love Amazon, this is the only problem I've ever had with a purchase. But I'll never purchase this cologne again from here..."
2,I didn't like but you may,"It was mistake buying a perfume just by reading amazon reviews. Everyone has different taste so you should try first before buying. Every one will not like vanilla fragrance. A word of warning, Amazon does not take returns of perfumes, it treats them as chemicals."
3,Not sure...???,"I love shopping with you on Amazon. However, this last purchase, which is my favorite of all time, seemed to be a bit ""weaker"" in scent, and for the money that it cost I was a bit unsure as to it's authenticity. Is a lot of money for not the real thing! Can you verify that for me?Thank youDebbie"
1,FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Beware It's a bad imitation!!!!!!!! Completely fake, fake smell, fake jar, fake all around..... Save your money!! It didn't smell right, maybe cause it seems to be the original 60 or so more times diluted!!"
1,THIS PRODUCT IS A COPY,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT ORIGINAL. IT IS LIKE THE ORIGINAL, IS GREAT COPY BUT NOT ORIGINAL."
5,Rich and creamy dark chocolate with fresh peanuts... delicious!,"This fudge is rich, decadent and perfect for any dark chocolate lover. The fresh peanuts mixed with the dark chocolate make an excellent sweet treat. Order yours today!"
2,"An interesting, if unoriginal, premise, mired in confusion.","As other reviewers point out, this work could have been much stronger than it is, had the author even attempted to apply a veneer of scientific reasoning; instead, he jumps into metaphysical digressions, endlessly referring to his previous works and theories. A disjointed, unscientific exposition which simply does not work. One would do well to read the earlier, far superior work by Marc Davenport, 'Visitors from Time'. At least he used facets from actual documented sightings to make his case. It is also better written than this confusing mess."
3,Just OK,"I believe that UFOs are time machines from the future, and that's why I got this book. I like that the spiritual side of UFO encounters is discussed (though I'm not one of those new-age people you run into, I do believe in reincarnation), but I don't like how little information there is or the lack of evidence for some of his claims (like the bit about the various planes of existence; I think he's been playing too much Dungeons & Dragons). If you want a good book on the subject, get Visitors From Time by Marc Davenport. That's one of my favorite books."
2,Less than expected,"I found the idea compeling but very loose is structure. So many of the authors concepts are not fulling developed and seem vague. His patients' stories assume that you have all the facts. Leave the physics to the physicists. Poorly written, edited and conceived."
1,Book is written by someone on drugs,Probably the most incoherent book I have ever read. I don't blame the seller. But trying to put mumbo jumbo into the ufo phenomena discredits its very attempt for plausible creedence . For new age idiots only.
1,A truly mentally deranged person...,"Goldberg's completely unscientific approach to the mass social delusion of alien abduction demonstrates in no uncertain terms that the man is either an unmitigated fraud or a seriously disturbed individual.Goldberg's claim to having communicated ""in English"", mind you, to time travelers from 1000-3000 years ago is preposterous. He drones on unconvicingly about multidimensional time travel without even so much as a scientific model or diagram to support his fallacious claims.The man is a fraud. Those who take this kind of drivel seriously are most certainly in need of professional help."
1,I want my money BACK!,"I want my money BACK! Do I have to tell you more about this ""book"". I'm soooooooooo disapointed..."
1,Not a Backup & Recovery book.,"The Backup & Recovery techniques could have been put in less than one third the size of this book. But the book goes needlessly into many of the MS SQL Server 2000 features that have absolutely nothing to do with Backup/Recovery at all. For example, what does Profiler have to do with backup/recovery? Or step by step configuration of SQL Server? If you start at page 305 and stop at page 510, you have read all there is to know about backups and restores. Beyond page 510 are some interesting special purpose topics like Replication and Log shipping etc, which can come in handy for a high availability OLTP systems. However, first four chapters are unnecessary details about NT security and SQL Server 2000 Architecture. Wait for a more focused book."
5,Tremendous value,"I don't see how you can beat this 12-oz ball pein hammer for certain applications. It's the perfect tool for driving brake caliper retaining pins in and out using this hammer and a pin punch tool. No claw to get in the way of other parts. Hickory handle, nice weight and balance, made by Vaughan. What's not to like?"
3,Good book for younger kids,"This isn't the best book read on divorce, but it is well written and is helpful for small children going thru a divorce. My daughter was 5 when I purchased this book (among many others.) It seemed to help her cope. Divorce is hard on anyone especially kids. Make sure to get as many resources as possible to help your child cope."
3,Why is Carmen so polite?,"When you are beaten out as a conductor by Arthur Fiedler, you're in trouble. That's what happens here to Pletnev, never one of my favorites, but in the Carmen Ballet he is particularly fussy and uninvolving. Fiedler didn't exactly catch fire in this piece, but the engineers at rCA gave him a sonic spectacular, and the conducting is good enough to carry the work with some excitment, unlike what one hears on this CD."
1,"oh my, this is quite horrible","I would expect such ridiculousness from someone who is in Slipknot but I'm disappointed in Tripp Eisen for contributing to this monstrosity. The lyrics are really dumb and cheesy. I do see a Marilyn Manson ripoff here but I see a Dope ripoff even more. This is 2 out of 2 for dumb side projects that members of Slipknot have contributed to. Keep up the good work, guys."
1,Utter garbage.,"Ok, they have some musical talent with Joey and Tripp. But my main major problem with this group is the vocalist, wensday or whatever his name is. He drags everything down. What the hell is wrong with his voice. It sounds like hes talking through a voicebox or choking on a hairball. I've given this band chances to grow on me, but they never have. I love Slipknot, Static-X, and Stonesour. But i hate murderdolls."
1,"A cheezy, non original shock-Rock Band","This album is horrible considering this band is a big ripoff of every other shock rock band. This band is so not originalthey are [imitations of] Alice Cooper,M.Manson,White Zombie,Rob Zombie.I bought this album all cause of one of the members in the Murderdolls is also apart of Static-X which Rock! Sadly there are only2 worthy songs that are actually good on this album, and theyare ""Dead In Hollywood, and ""Dawn Of the Dead, so yourbetter off downloading those 2 songs that I mentioned cause the rest of the album is a big pile of ( you know what)If you like pointless non meaningful crumby plain out bad music, this album is for you, but take it for me, dont waste your money on the Murderdolls, I am just hoping the Murderdollsnever ever release another album....."
2,A rip-off but okay,"First of all, whoever said this album has death metal in it, obviously has no clue what death metal is. I know, because I love death metal.(Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under, Nile, Decapitated, Skinless, Dying Fetus etc.) Secondly, I also love punk rock, as you can tell by my name. Now, Alot of people say this album has punk elements to it which it does, but gee, uh, did'nt a really great legendary punk band already do this about 27 or so years ago? Thats right the Misfits. I know theres obvioulsy many differences between the 2 bands, but the overall meaning of the music is the same.This album is ok, but its been done before... many times."
2,Homosexual Barbie Dolls,"Throw Joey Jordison (the best damn drummer there is) and Tripp Eisen (from Static-X)into a blender and what do you get? A side project that brings nothing but embarrasingly bad lyrics, and typical everything else. There look may appeal to some but its nothing youve never seen before. The vocalists voice sounds raspy and feminine, and is reminiscent of Marilyn Manson. Their lyrics cover the same area of old horror movies and murder, which was already perfected by Rob Zombie. I really expected alot from such talented musicians like Joey and Tripp, but this cd is a steaming pile of [you know what]. The only song I half-enjoyed was ""Dawn of the Dead"". If you enjoy violent glam-rock give this cd a try but their music is so shallow and unoriginal. A big disappointment.Instead try such excellent artists as: Tool,Nirvana,Deftones,NIN, Slipknot, Mudvayne, Slayer, Pantera, Manson."
1,What is this?,"I myself is a Slipknot Fan, love their work. Now anyone who thinks i would buy this trash just because of Joey Jordsons work in slipknot is on crack. All i see is a wanna be Different Song writer writting songs like a depressed 14 yr old would write after a fight with his parents. Please if you like music, respect song writting....Skip this. Nothing but i want to kill everyone type bullSh#t that the world doesnt need."
4,ITS SKID ROW With Make Up And Acid,This Band Is Great. They Have This Driving Rock And Roll Sound That You Just Get Hooked On. They Sound Like A Cross Of Skid Row And The Misfits With A Few Metallisounds In It Too. I Recommend It To Anyone Whos Been Looking For That Original Rock And Roll Sound That We All Thought Was Dead. Jordison Sounds Like Sebastian Bach And Well You Will Need To Hear It For Futher Info.
3,Murderdolls - 'Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls',"I was initially reluctant to get this album but on the strength of the video `Dead in Hollywood' I added to my bi-weekly disc retail therapy session.Not being a fan of 'Slipknot' and the average release by 'Stone Sour' I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary. I now find myself having this disc on rotation.Don't be fooled by the look, Joey Jordison has parked his guitar and taken the sticks to a kit and in partnership with 'Static X's' Tripp Eisen deliver a straight shooting lethal cocktail of rippin' sleaze rock that would have early Motley Crue et al creaming their shorts.There is not a single thing I can say bad about this album. Tracks `Slit My Wrist', `People Hate Me' & `Twist My Sister' would have butt slammed the glam rock scene big style when the `spandex and hairspray brigade' was king.This is a `lew'd & crew'd' reminder of how muzik can be played without this saturated Nu-metal splatter......""Pass me the eye-liner there..."""
5,Do yourself a favor and buy this CD!,"If you're a fan of the Misfits, Twisted Sister, Marilyn Manson and the Ramones then the Murderdolls are right up your alley. They combine elements from all of these groups into their songs which are short, sweet, catchy and they all rock. Pretty damn good considering that Joey Jordinson played all of the instruments except for a guitar solo here and there. The look of the band and the theme of the songs are straight out of a B-movie horror flick. Saw the band live in Arizona and they are tight and have a lot of fun, one of the best shows I have seen in a long time."
3,"Not bad, but gets old fast...","When I heard that Joey from Slipknot and Tripp from Static-X were collaborating and forming their own band, I had high expectations. But when I first heard this album, I was slightly dissapointed.Okay, the whole ""glam-punk-horror-lyrics-rawk"" thing is fun for about three tracks, but then it just gets old. There is little variety in this album. The only song that really stands out to me is #15: ""Mother******"" I don't care"". Probably because it's catchy with dark, humourous lyrics. But other than that, most of the album is okay, definitely listenable, but it doesn't take long before it gets tiresome.Still, I give it 3/5 stars for ""Mother****** I don't care"" and trying something different."
5,mUrDeRdoLLs rule. . . this is for lance,... wat can i say otha than ... MURDERDOLLS are the bestest EVA... i first heard em in a friends car and i went out and bought the cd... i can say its my best purchase eva...id like to thank lance for this...and that MURDERDOLLS RULE
5,200% Perfect album!!,"First thing's first, ok? Murderdolls are not posers and they play absolutely fantastic music. The music is absolutely incredible and their drummer is fantastic, as well as Joey Jordison (Slipknot's drummer) on the guitar, who plays ABSOLUTELY fantastic! He's as good a guitarist as he is a drummer! And the vocals by Wedneday 13 are very interesting in the sound as well as being extremely entertaining.What was that you said? These lyrics are depressing?Absolutely NOT! These lyrics are well written(really!) (ok maybe not that good) and the surprising things is that they are absolutely hilarious at times! If you're looking for a fantastic new band you should check out Murderdolls."
5,I LOVE THIS CD,"This cd is absolutaly awsome to sing with! The lyrics are great, the singer, wednesday 13, has such a cool voice, and there's so many catchy guitar solo's...this is a must have for music lovers!"
3,The color did not match the picture,The texture of the sheet is nice but it was very yellow. I was expecting a cream color so I was disappointed.
2,Alright,"The quality of this product was completely fine but my problem is with the color choices. The item I ordered was labeled as cream but when it arrived it was very much a yellow. I would have returned it if I didn't need it right away as a back up crib sheet. Otherwise, the sheet is soft."
3,Cream = Yellow,"This is a fine sheet, but I;m unhappy with the color. I ordered ""cream"" expecting it to to be an off white or even beige color. It's basically bright yellow."
1,Too loose to use safely,"When it comes to our baby's crib, safety rules. Unfortunately, this sheet did not fit our crib mattress (MDB Twilight) tightly enough to be safe. It was a loose enough fit that the fabric gathered along the side edges of the mattress, and our 4 month old might have been capable of pulling it off the mattress entirely. We haven't had this trouble with the fit of other brands' more conventional (non-jersey) cotton sheets."
5,"Super soft, true to color","I ordered this sheet in turquoise and burnt orange and both are just wonderful. The burnt orange is not too ""burnt"" and brown, just a nice pumpkin color, and the turquoise is as pictured. I was hoping the turquoise might be a little bolder than the photo provided but it's no. So if you're looking for BRIGHT bright colors, these might not be the sheets for you. They really do have deep sides and they are soft like the softest t-shirt you've ever felt. For $14 a piece, I'd highly recommend!"
4,Nice warm sheet,"It is a nice warm knit sheet for the crib. Baby likes it and the colour is as shown. I like light colours so that the child is not distracted by dark colours. The only thing is that it is a little thin in quality of the knit fabric as others had pointed out. But, I am happy with it as it is warm."
5,finally a sheet that fits,"i tried so many sheets and nothing fit my 7 inch mattress ,finally these fit normally,so glad i got them,thanks"
3,Color is off,not the color they advertise it to be. It is a little more on the green side than the picture shows.
5,So soft,"Yes, as in other review color is a touch lighter, but that's what I needed. It has washed up so well. My favorite sheet by far."
4,Good quality,"I was happy to find this nice bright color on Amazon. I was actually wishing for a slightly deeper teal color, but this turquoise is nice too. We are having another little boy, and I am oh-so-tired of the brown and baby blue combo that seems to be rampant in baby boy items.Having never heard of this brand, I set my expectations low regarding quality, but the sheet is actually very nice. It is actually a bit softer/smoother and seems like a marginally better product (tighter knit) than a similar Carter's brand jersey crib sheet that I have.We are waiting for our new little guy to arrive, so I haven't used it with baby yet, but I did wash it and put it on the crib... so far so good!"
3,Faded a little after the first wash....,This sheet has been durable and is true to the color in the image when I received it. The sheet faded slightly after the first wash which I guess is to be expected with a jersey sheet. It's very soft and seems comfortable for babies.
3,Nice sheet but def NOT cream/ivory...very yellow!,"Wrong color; says cream, but is def more a yellow...totally not what I was expecting or wanted. These are going back."
5,Great quality,"Great looking, the color is very true to the picture. It fits our serta crib mattress perfectly. It's great quality, especially for the price."
3,Insipid,"Sorry, I know many people seem to have enjoyed this. I guess it's just not for everybody.I've got to page 200 and I just can't go on with it. I find the plot slightly odd and much too contrived (without giving anything away some of the coincidences are just too much), the pace a bit ploddy and the characters insipid. I just can't bring myself to care enough about them to continue."
5,Love in Exile,"Love in Exile is a beautiful album, and has been my album of the year for the last two years. The songs are beautiful and the playing flawless....think of all your heroes (or mine rather)...Mingus, Coltrane, Pharoah, Dizzy and then listen to this album. It is true and soulful and arguably one of the greatest albums of the 20th Century...I said it and I stand behind that statement. When you hear the album, you'll know why."
4,Great Outdoor fun!,This was a great purchase. We have a swingset in the backyard and our child was getting a little old to be swinging (6). But we bought the trapeze and he loves it. He is outside most days doing flips and hanging upside down.The trapeze came earlier than expected. I was tracking it and it showed up on our doorstep several days earlier!

5,Do Yourself a Favor and Buy This Book!,"Folks, Kevin Trudeau here, marketer of such great products as Mega Memory, Coral Calcium, Nutrition For Life, and my latest bestselling book ""Natural Cures 'They' Don't Want You to Know About"". Let me just tell you that after a little scrape with the law as a kid, I was feeling really low until one day when I ran into DON LAPRE at Bennigan's and he took me aside, put his arm around me and said cheer up kid. Then he proceeded to tell me everything he knows about selling on the internet. Now my businesses earn in excess of $2 billion dollars a year. Thanks DON!"
2,Short and rushed overview,"Although Mr. McGann explains things clearly, I think he tried to tackle too much in this one and the entire effort suffers. There is a section on Bluegrass, Celtic, and Swing, but each is too short to do much justice to or teach much about each topic. After viewing it, this one felt too much like an overview and not really much use as an instructional video. It felt like each section was just getting interesting and I was about to learn something and then it was on to the next section! I was expecting more content and depth than this on a DVD.If I had to do it over, I wouldn't have purchased this."
5,Perfect,"I've used the product before, so it's what I expected. Very viscous, makes hair extremely smooth after being blowed dry."
2,Not what I expected,"Steel? Is that what it is? It's design is nice, but it's about as flimsy as you can get! We were going to give it for a present after our son graduated from boot camp. After all the hard work he did, this would have been an insult to give him. We found another one that was much sturdier."
2,boring,"This c.d. is boring. I didn't learn anything new or helpful. But, perhaps if this is your first attempt to address your depression, it might be helpful. Good luck"
5,An Aid for Rallying Your Strength,"If you live far from complementary care centers where guided imagery is an integral part of your treatment (or if you've become isolated from them such as I have following the events of September), you might feel like you're missing a piece of the puzzle. Surgery and chemo are part of the solution... but you have to rally your own strength to deal with cancer. I believe that this tape allows you to do that... in several ways. If you don't jive with one part of the tape, there are others. One of them is bound to touch you in a meaningful way."
5,Love Belleruth!,I got this for my dad. He really likes it. It's helping him through his treatments. He also finds it very relaxing when he can't sleep. We've always liked Belleruth's products!
2,The thrill is gone,"I really liked this CD and found it initially helpful, but after a week of listening, it got old, so I purchased two others with different subjects. I was disappointed to discover after buying them that they all basically contain the same dialog. For almost $20 each you would expect subject driven content rather than a generic script with a few minor changes."
5,Book hit close to home,"This is one of my all time favorite books. Not only because the commune was located in my home town of Powell River B.C, but also because many of us, myself included, were experiencing the same feelings as Mark Vonnegut in the late 60s, early 70s. I have been to the commune many times, and still feel a connection to the book, and the era, each time I go. An extremely good read; thought provoking!"
4,Amazing Personal Account,I am 15 years old and I read this book for a Schizophrenia research paper. Mark Vonnegut has been my doctor in Boston all of my life. It was an interesting journey to explore through HIS perspective of his own experience... Highly Reccomend it!
3,A sometimes exhausting journey,"Though I enjoyed this book, I found it so exhausting at times trying to understand what Vonnegut was describing. I know that this is a chronicle of his ever-steepening slide into insanity and I guess Vonnegut is trying to take the reader along the same dysfunctional, confusing and sometimes scary path he was on - if that was his goal, he totally succeeded. It was an interesting topic to read about, especially from a firsthand account, and I was totally absorbed by some of the experiences Vonnegut had. I liked that he shared his experience so honestly, sometimes brutally so, and it gave me a very real insight into schizophrenia that made me much more sympathetic to those inflicted with mental illness.I wouldn't say this book is a gripping page turner but it's definitely well worth reading."
1,I couldn't even finish it,"I am so sorry -- but I couldn't even finish it, and I really, really tried. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for it and should try it another time."
4,Extremely hopeful; Valuable to medical & literary community,"When I read it nearly 10 years ago in Germany, I fell in love with the writing, clear and with deep compassion for all the people that he came in contact with. His ability to tie in the overwhelming impulses of the schizophrenic to the everyday pressures we all experience is truly priceless. After reading it, I realised that others were wrestling with the same fears of failure, disappointment, and acceptance. Truly a wonderful book. Hopefully, Amazon.com can find a copy for me."
5,Great book,"I first read this book when it came out and at the time wondered how it was to be the son of the famous Kurt Vonnegut, and how being in the shadow all one's life couldn't be good for the development of his son. I thought the book was well written and really captured the feel of the times. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to grasp the 1960's with all it's various shades and colors."
3,great and very discriptive but a little outdated,"as above, well written , very detailed but the diagnoses and treatment have changed. Overall a beautiful read and very positive and hopeful for anyone who experiences the same"
1,Way too expensive,This poster is way too expensive. I found the exact poster on a slew of other sites for as low as $5.99. This price is criminal. Keep searching for a cheaper one
3,Was hoping for more than an Idea book...,"I like the images and they are very inspiring, but I found this book to be a big let-down for me. I was hoping for more insight on how the processes are done, not what the finished projects looked like.Great if you're looking for inspiration; horrible if you're looking for instruction."
2,"Beautiful pix, not much helpful info","There is not as much useful information in this book as I was expecting. The photos are good and I like the overall quality of the book, but the subtitle is misleading, as it is an artist showcase more than it is an ""A-Z guide"". When I got to the ""Workshop"" section at the back, I thought I finally got to the meat of the book, but it wasn't much better. For example, there are sidebar lists of Studio Essentials for the workshops, which list items such as ""a retro Genie telephone"" and ""music, music, music."" Cute, but not terribly helpful.Quoting the book:""Where do ideas come from? Everywhere.......It is comforting to remember that the next great idea is right around the corner.""I have no shortage of ideas. I buy books to learn some new techniques that I may not have tried before."
1,Baked Air,"Perella and Pals ought to have been the title of this book, as it 'showcases' the work of said artist and her chums. It gives virtually no creative guide to anyone that I can imagine, no hint of the process that leads to any of the finished work, and some of the work is plainly terrible. An awful lot of what passes as mixed media or altered art these days is just crap that someone throws together, distresses a little and puts some stupid inspirational word to ('dream', 'friends', 'voyage' - you *know* the rubbish I mean), and I am afraid that a lot of the work in this book falls into that category. I bought the book, I read it, then re-read it, hoping to see something jewel-like that I'd missed the first time - I think I even shook the book in case something might fall out. Alas."
5,"""A""mazing to Zeal inspiring","This book is inspirational. It is like the art version of Pride and Prejudice, if you open it to any page you must delve further. I actually have two copies: one in the studio, and (I hate to say it) one in the bathroom--what can I say ideas strike at the oddest times.I can look at it daily and read something new, get a new idea, or be inspired visually by something I could swear I had never seen before (yet I know I must have).Love! Love! Love this book! Buy it! You will not be disappointed."
4,OK,gave as a christmas present and was received well. no issues with the product or the time it took to receive
4,Baseball Album,These notebooks are what I put all my baseball cards in along with protective pages. They keep all my cards protected.
2,Ultra Pro 3-ring binder for baseball cards,The binder is well-made and came well-packaged. It's nothing special - just a padded 3-ring binder - but it met the needs of the recipient and that's all that matters.
5,Great replacement!,This was just what I needed to replace the OEM plastic one. I did a flip off a jump and my car fell upside down and that was the end of it (broke in half). So I had to buy a new one. Came across this one and knew it would be right for me. INDESTRUCTIBLE!! A must if you need to replace a broken one.
3,Good all-round camera,"Great little camera in all respects - except one ..... it has difficulty focusing in poor light. Other than that, it works like a charm. True 4 mpix clarity. Fast processing. Easy to use.I had no problem with the software provided .... because I did not need to use it. I enjoyed USB plug and play connectivity with my three different computers with three different operating systems: Mac OS X, Widows XP professional and Windows 2000."
3,"Nice camera, no customer support.","I just got my Sharp VE-CG40U yesterday, and I'm pleased with the image quality, but I had some trouble setting up the camera with my PC using the directions in the manual. I called the customer support number listed in the book, and the Sharp representative had never heard of the camera and was mystified to hear that Sharp even produced digital cameras!The camera only works with Windows and not Macs. So if you have a Windows machine and are pretty handy with figuring out your own computer issues, this camera seems to be a fine choice. If you're more of a novice with your PC, this isn't going to work for you."
3,He's Okay,"I think the poor guy has had too much fame to soon. His okay on the radio, since in the latino community there is not much to listen to. I'll have to admit, as a community leader his made his mark, but as a singer he should retire. The Latino community will buy this record as if though it were the last CD on earth. It's too bad we don't have more Latino disc jockey's who are allowed the airtime this guy is given. I'm 100% sure there are better guys out there.However, if you are a faithful Cucuy listener I'm sure you'll enjoy this CD."
4,Pretty Good,This is pretty good. It has a couple good songs. I recommend this for any black metal beginner
1,Not Good,"These guys just like enthroned and lord belial are just here to annoy. All the songs sound identical with boring riffs and squawked vocals. The real stuff is emperor, dark throne and mayhem."
5,Second take on this cd.,"Well, I wrote a review for this a few years ago, but have sinced changed opinions. This is some very raw black metal, and the sound quality is really poor. However, if you can stand to listen to it loud enough, this album sky rockets in its worth. At a higher volume, you can hear a much more complicated guitar line, and even some hints of a keyboard, but the keyboard is absoluty buried, if I wasn't imagining it. The most problematic aspect of this album is that at a more usual volume, many of this songs a) sound horrible, and b) sound the same. For fans of the genre, it's going to be a worthwhile listen, but if you're just getting into black metal, you may want to put off purchasing this one."
1,Quite boring & repetetive....,"Well, i wasn impress by this band known as dark funeral...Their music is mediocre and way to repetetive plus whil listining to this i didn't hear any talent whats so ever! If their porpuse was to sound ""scary"" & ""satanic"" they failed at it badly (laughs)!! The top and best black metal band by far is cradel of filth and they'll remain at the top...That is not to say bands such as darkthrone,dimmuborgir & vehemence are not doing their job. Well, if you want good black metal with real satanic lirycs & scary subject matters buy any album by cradel of filth and you'll be all set... Dont buy dark funeral's ""the secrets of black arts"" not only its boring but repetetive & un original in other words dark funeral is a rip-off so skip this!"
1,i looked for quite a while,"and I did not find one sentence that made much sense at all!Not one.It's a Miss Macintosh, My Darling for the psychology set.Kudos to the author on getting this published."
2,YMMV,"The neckband looked like a good idea, but it didn't fit me well, nor work for me. The angle of the boom is not adjustable and the padded earcup no longer attached."
4,Good Stuff,Bram Tchaikovsky really only had one good album in them but what a good album! It is always hard to say if the music is great on its own or whether it is just the warm and fuzzy glow of nostalgia that makes it sound so good. But there is no denying that it is very catchy and it makes you feel good.
2,"terrible dvd, great movie","The movie feels cramped. This is a great story, but it's ruined by the DVD conversion. To convert this from its original format into ""widescreen"", the studio just chopped the top and bottom off each frame. So you get people's heads and hats either cut off or up against the top of the frame, and the story, shot in the wide open spaces of the Southwest, has a cramped and claustrophobic feel to it. All because of the rotten DVD conversion. The director must be seriously ticked off about his movie being ruined like this."
5,Tight well presented package,"It's a gestalt. It's a simple story with a clear picture of multicultural tension. Plot layout gives a rounded view of the societal macro implicitly within a small town story. Watched it several times; could find no fluff, no throwaway. Kristofferson, is pure redneck evil. Elizabeth Peña's dreamy style offered attractive counterpoint to her high tension role. All in all, feels like a classic."
2,"Superior film, very poor-quality DVD","If you are a huge fan of this movie (as I am), don't waste your time purchasing this DVD version, it is far inferior to the VHS, which I wish I had purchased in its stead.The DVD is in ""anamorphic widescreen,"" a skinny ribbon format that cuts off about 25% of the screen on the top and 25% on the bottom, consequently deleting almost 50% of the onscreen action.I've seen this film about 20 times on VHS where the quality is far superior to this very substandard DVD version, which incidentally also washes out those magnificent cinematic colors that Sayles habitually uses in his films. A very disappointing reproduction of this masterpiece of a film."
3,"""Complex and rich...""","I won't go into a deep analysis of the films theme. Amazon calls it, ""Complex and rich."" That's true. Problem is, there's just too much of it. They could have shaved at least twenty minutes off this film, leaving out some of the dragging dialogue in the third act which added nothing of substance to the film that hadn't already been previously introduced, and had a much better film for the effort. The first 60% of the film had me very interested, but somewhere around the last 45-60 minutes it just started to bog down in unecessary dialogue, dragging from scene to scene, and by the last 30 minutes I found myself just fast forwarding through a couple of the more irrelevant draggy scenes, something I very seldom do. It is not a bad movie, the themes are relevant, and the acting is satisfactory. It is just that the execution lacks."
3,Keeping need to know information secret has consequences,A small town in Texas has to face the secretsthat have been kept for nearly 40 yearswhen a grave is found in the deserton an old Army firing range.The sheriff has to face the legend of his fatherand others come to grips with the border crossing problemsand those who have settled without citizenship.The explanation of their parent's apparent prejudiceis finally revealed as part of the mystery.I liked the movie which comes to grips with the changing times and how history is shifting...
5,Simply the best indie film in years...,"I saw this movie when it was first released, and then again this week-end on TNT. It's one of the best films I've seen and I plan to purchase it for my library.It doesn't have a lot of action and the plots develop slowly, but, like In the Heat of the Night, there is not one throw-away scene.I've never seen Kristofferson so evil...his work was real enough to be very, very scary. I liked Chris Cooper and Frances McDormand is a riot in her all-too-brief scene as Cooper's strung-out ex-wife.I live in a small town in east Texas and I know people like the Sheriff, Big O, Buddy and the others.The plot twist at the end might be a bit off-putting for some, but, to me, it just added to the quality of the writing, directing, acting and drama.This is a movie to be savored. Do not expect action, car crashes or surrealistice special effects. It's a film about real people facing real issues and doing their best to right some very bad wrongs.Enjoy!"
3,It's OK but no more,"By no means a ""masterpiece"" as many reviewers are too easily willing to call it.Just a good movie tackling upon some ""hot"" issues of crime, dirty politics, corruption,interracial relations, racism, illegal immigration, immigrants and even incest.For my taste, Roman Polanski in his real masterpiece ""Chinatown"" told about similar themes in much more effective and much more interesting way during the same 130 minutes of the film's length.""A Lone Star"" tries hard but fails to achieve a true greatness of a masterpiece."
2,might have been good but wasn't,"After reading all of the great reviews for this movie, I was very disappointed in this film. Potentially a good story, but it couldn't overcome the trite dialogue and generally poor acting."
2,Overrated dramatic mess.,"I purchased this movie because I love Chris Cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive. I played the movie yesterday and boy, was I disappointed.The movie was much too slow and boring. I love mysteries and hate dramas therefore I thought the little personal stories throughout with flashbacks actually detracted from what I thought was going to be a good mystery story. In the end the mystery is solved with a thud and don't get me started on the quasi Luke & Leia moment at the end. PLEASE!!"
4,"a very dark, but very good movie","Being a southerner I've seen this kind of corruption up close and personal. This movie is very dark, but it is also very, very good. The cast is stellar and the story has more twists than a labyrinth. Anyone who likes a complicated, suspense thriller will enjoy this film."
4,4 1/2 stars for a masterful western,"Somehow I managed to miss this 1996 film until now. It is certainly one of the best modern westerns to come along. Chris Cooper heads an excellent cast, playing the son of a legendary sheriff of a Texas border county. He himself is now the sheriff, but had issues with his father while growing up. Writer/director/editor John Sayles does brilliant work with the screenplay, salted with interesting characters. The skeletal remains of a man are found in an old rifle range and Cooper's character begins an investigation. Sayles' story turns up more figurative skeletons as the story develops. I was also impressed with Elizabeth Pena who I'd only seen in stereotyped work before. She's brilliant here. Sayles most impressive component of this film is how he manages the scene changes from the current time to the flashback setting. Slow camera pans make it easy for the audience to follow the story. A controversial ending to be sure, but it works for me."
5,One Great Movie,"An often overlooked American classic so well done that you will forget you are watching a movie. It is a bit hard to follow as it tells a story in flashbacks--jumps from the present to the past. But it is a great story of a subject that is overlooked in American Cinema--the clash in the Southwest between the Anglos and the Mexicans, and the misery that was heaped on the Mexicans by the Anglos. It is a story that has been going on for almost 200 years but has yet to be told. After seeing this you will understand the saying, ""Mexicans never crossed the border, the border crossed them."""
5,One of the best films of the past 10 years,"""Lone Star"" is terrific as both a mystery and as a snapshot of small town America, Texas-Mexican border style. However, it is something else going on here. As Sam moves between the Hispanic, White, and Black communities in Rio County, we see how members of each group feel that their ethic group is different and separate from the others. However, in the end, the movie shows us how we are all pretty much the same and the degree that our lives are intertwined. (Look for a scene in an African-American bar where a record is playing on a jukebox. Later, virtually the same record, this time sung in Spanish, is played on the jukebox in a Mexican restaurant.) At the end of the film there is a final surprise that pretty much left me stunned while driving home the point of just how closely related to each other we all are."
2,Very weak!,"These guys were some of the first to ever combine melody in Swedish death metal, and they did put out two quality albums before this disaster. Entombed and other bands went death n' roll, much to my dismay, and Desultory followed, sacrificing their original and crushing sound. This sounds most like recent Corrosion of Conformity albums, but much, much stupider. The last two tracks are more in their old style. You can tell that from the shaved heads (are these the same guys who made ""Bitterness?"" Nah...), the new ""logo,"" and idiotic song titles that this is not like their old stuff. Hey! Stop taking uppers and get depressed again!"
3,Not Bad For a Single,"This is a DVD disc containing the music video of New Killer star, some interview quotes pieced together with sections of music, and his cover of Love Missle F1-11.1. The Music Video. The biggest dissapointment here is the lack of Bowie himself, I really would love to have seen his face in the video. It's an interesting video, definately done in a style I've never seen done before, but I'm not sure if I like it or not.2. The interview. This isn't too long, it is essentially a preview for the album reality, and I don't know why you would have this single if you don't already have the album.3. The cover. Eh, I can't say I like it too much. Basically, there's a reason it wasn't on the album.The worst thing about this is it is not an audio CD, so don't buy it thinking you can stick it in your cd player. It is a DVD. Definately unique, as Bowie is good at doing for us, but start with the album Reality, and then buy this if you're enfatuated."
1,Not good,"Biosilk is amazing. The conditioner is not.It drys out your hair, does not make it soft at all. And makes my hair feel unclean."
1,not happy,"I have ordered many times from Amazon, and this is the first time I was not happy. When we received the product and took the top off, the pump part had been opened, and most of the makeup was inside the lid, losing more than 1/2 of the product. We love the product, but the shipping/handling was very bad, we were very unhappy."
2,Watered Down Foundation,"The product ""Stila Illuminating Liquid Foundation"" is incredibly watered down. Feels like you're putting paint on your face, as you actually feel it dripping down your skin as you apply. At the same time, it feels heavy and sticky once applied. That being said, I was quite surprised to see how flawless my skin looked after using it. But if you're looking for something that will wear all day, this isn't it."
2,Too Shiny For Me,"I thought that theStila Illuminating Liquid Foundation, 10 Watts, 1 Ouncewould be better for me than my off-the-shelf foundation that I got at Walmart. The Stila foundation was on backorder, so I didn't get it with the rest of my shipment (which includedStila Illuminating Powder Foundation Refill, 10 Watts, 0.34 Ounce) I'd planned to wear the powder version over the liquid version. When I tried this, it looked too fake. I tried the liquid foundation alone with my Marutaki Rice Powder I got some time ago from the VT Country Store. Better, but still too shiny for my taste. I ended up sending it back.Right now I've decided to wear (in this order) moisturizer, the Stila Beauty Balm, my Walmart liquid foundation topped with the powder version of the Illuminating Foundation. I top everything off with the Marutaki Rice Powder because it gives a nice matte finish. Sounds like a lot, but it works and looks really natural blended well."
1,Disappointing,"I heard from a number of people that Amon Amarth were an excellent death metal band, so with that in mind, I though I'd try OSFTGH. What I hear, and it certainly seems I'm missing out on something, is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting. Just because you have mead dripping from your beard, and you scream out lyrics that contain, no mercy, vengeance and ""it's your time to die"" does not mean you can create ""authentic"" Viking/metal. These idiots could definitely take lessons from: Enslaved, Manegarm, Falkenbach to name a few. Don't fall for the hype!!"
4,Melodic Death Metal,"Amon Amarth is one of my favorite Death Metal bands. While this album is very good, its not as good as Crusher and later work. Its still worth listening to but not one of those cd's that kept finding itself in the cd player. The band started out in the right direction, and refined their sound by their third album."
3,Classic,"A bit more grinding and faster than later albums, this still has the melodic rhythm section that are familiar on later records. Vocals vary from a death metal shriek to a cookie monster growl. I am stoked that this got remastered and reissued as it is a classic album by a modern band."
5,Amazing,"When I first heard this album I was completly blown away. The first song started out and after a minute I was hooked. By the time it came to Victorius March I knew I had to have all of Amon Amarths albums. If you are into Death Metal, Melodic Metal, or any type of Metal I would recomend this CD."
4,Good Release,"I give this release 4-stars because the vocals did not appeal to me as their later releases did. I started with Amon Amarth from their latest CD ""Twilight of the Thunder God"" and worked my way back. The music on all their work is excellent, but what really grabbed me were the vocals, not just the subject matter, but the style of vocals.Those vocals were rough, aggressive, growling, but they also carried melody, and were understandable. While the vocal style on OSFTGH is still great, compared to similar bands, for me it pales compared to Twilight, Oden on our Side, Versus the World, and Fate of Norns."
4,Down home satire,"Good songs that rip into the ""good ole' days"" and ""traditional values"" of an era. A bit more subtle than modern parodies."
2,The Encyclopedia of Window Fashions : 1000 Decorating Ideas,You will be surprised how amazing the patterns of the curtains that they have in the book.But initially it is a great dissapointment to me cause the book doesn't teaches me the way on how to start and how the diagram of the curtain looks like.I would rather recommend this book to them who really have the advance knowledge of making curtains and also for them who wanted to see more designs in a curtains.
3,Picture guide--okay but not complete,"This is a book of window treatment sketches. Unfortunately, it is far from complete and lacks many styles. We do use this book in the trade, but I wish it were more complete--I find it lacking with many new styles. It also lacks many of the current styles being offered by the professional pattern companies."
2,Not impressed,"This book was very basic. It is mostly drawings of different drapery styles with a few drawings of Roman Shades and Balloon Shades. I was looking for something that would give me ideas as to where certain window treatments might look best (what type of shade for each room, types of fabric, etc....)"
2,Not what I expected,This was too much money to pay for a book of drawings. I expected photos of rooms.
1,Very disappointing,"When I read the title (1000 decorating ideas), I thought this would be just what I needed. What I got instead was a bunch of sketches. To me, ""decorating ideas"" implies that I'll see how to put it all together, such as how a window treatment works into a room or goes with furnishings I have. There isn't anything on how to choose, how to put it all together. Just sketches of individual ideas. I feel cheated."
4,Great Ideas,This book was recommended to me by a friend and I have not been disappointed. It is full of wonderful ideas.
2,same ol' same old,would have been much better as line sketched - colors and patterns persuades the customer in one way or the other
3,A Strange Serial,"As serials go, this isn't bad, although it would be nice if the picture quality were a little less fuzzy. This is a very strangely constructed serial, unlike any other I can recall. There's no carry-over from chapter to chapter. There's an overlap: each chapter ends with a fake cliff-hanger which is resolved in the beginning of the following chapter(usually by some deus-ex-machina that we just didn't happen to see in the previous chapter), but whatever the previous chapter was about is resolved and each new chapter poses a new problem. It's the same good guys and bad guys throughout, but each time, the bad guys are after something different, like the plans for a supersonic plane or a treasury engraver who can forge counterfeit plates or (even!) a shipment of stolen furs! Obviously there's nothing deep or meaningful here; just fun. If you like old serials (not that there are too many new ones!), go for this."
4,The Flying Wing Was Ahead Of Its Time,"DICK TRACY was a serial produced by Republic only six years after the popular comic strip hero made his first appearance in the Chicago Tribune- New York News Syndicate Newspapers. Throughout fifteen chapters the detective dueled with the Spider Gang whose leader was known as the Lame One. DICK TRACY was one of the better serials made during the 1930's.Ralph Byrd had the role of Dick Tracy and the supporting cast included Kay Hughes, Smiley Burnette, Lee Van Atta and Francis X. Bushman. My favorite movie prop in this serial had to be the Flying Wing."
3,Great Movie - bad DVD,"As has been said in many reviews - this movie rocks. However, the presentation in the DVD is full frame - unfortunately. However, it is not a simple pan and scan of the widescreen. The movie was shot in 35 mm 4:3 format and cropped to 1.85:1. I compared frames from the extras on the Confidence (2003) DVD (which showed a couple of shots in widescreen) and this DVD. The Sting DVD shows more above and below the black bars, but does loose some to the left and right. Not really a pan and scan, but not really the full frame before the 1.85:1 crop either..."
1,Great film/awful transfer,"This is one of my all-time favorite films for a number of reasons. However, this DVD is a worthless piece of junk. It is full screen and muddy in appearance. The widescreen VHS must be better than this. The Sting deserves a better fate."
5,The Sting 2 DVD Legacy Edition!!! R.I.P. Paul Newman!!!,"This is a great 2 dvd Legacy Ediiton of The Sting which won 7 Oscars including Best Picture!!! R.I.P. Paul Newman,you will me missed!!! The anamorphic widescreen transfer looks great on a HD TV,great sound too!!! There is a 2nd disc with the extras,which make make a nice rounded out package!!! A+ Classic timeless movie!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Wait for the widescreen edition, which, as Christian Pelchat pointed out, is not far away since this year marks the movie's 30th anniversary. It is shocking to see movies released in full-screen when they were originally shot with widescreen film, and furthermore, when all TVs will be widescreen within the next 5-7 years. Most people don't understand that you are losing up to 50% of the picture when you watch a full-screen movie, which is a tragedy.To Universal Studios: Shame on you for releasing a full-screen version only."
3,Entertaining .... BUT,"Film was entertaining, but I don't see why all the accolades (7 academy awards, including best picture)Watch it for fun, but don't expect anything more."
1,Bad disc??? be careful!,This disc would not play on my brand new HD-DVD player! and there are no problems playing other discs.
4,can't help but love redford and newman,"This has long been a favorite movie of mine, so I was excited about its dvd release. Unfortunately, the disc contains no special materials and is presented in a pan-and-scan format. The film has been decently restored,it always had a grainly look to it, and it still does. Wonderful performances all around, particularly by Newman and Shaw, who have a brilliant face-off while playing poker on the train. Scott Joplin score keeps it moving. This film is as fun as the other great con-man movie of the '70's, Paper Moon, and probably a better film overall."
2,"Great Film, Bad Transfer","This a classic, great Hollywood film. It is unfortunate that the transfer is horrendous. Bad audio and literally, a dirty video transfer. In fact, it looks like a VHS tape. I am also puzzled that my cover art was not in color like the rest of the copies I see posted on Amazon. Hmmm, was I bamboozled with a knock-off?Film gets 5 stars while dvd gets 1."
5,"Great movie, period!!!","Forget about the aspect ratio, focus on the film and it's plot...The story is superb, the acting is first class, the customs and the beautiful music is unique!!!! The HD version is great with no ""snowy"" images when is shot in the dark (like Blu-ray).. I love this movie. If you are a true movie lover without prejudices, you will love it!!"
5,incomparable and truly original!,"THE STING is just a marvelous piece of storytelling. I don't even know where to begin. Since I really don't want to give away too many plot details and ruin it, I will say this: con artists provide some of the best plot scenarios in celluloid storytelling! That is, if the story is as well-orchestrated and seamless as George Ray Hill's take on an unbelievable storyline, centered on two con men (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) seeking vengeance on the head of a mobster (Robert Shaw) who knocked off their colleague. And, that's the only plot element I'm going to reveal. If anything, you should see it for the marvelous Scott Joplin score. You can't replicate this kind of brilliant filmmaking. If you haven't fallen in love with Paul Newman already, you will after you see this!"
5,One of the great movie classics!,"I thought this film would be boring, but I was so wrong! the acting is stunning, obviously, and the plot is fantastic. The quality of the film is shown in the first scene of an elaborate theft and this is the basis for the rest of the film, with a clever and complicated web of conning and bluffing. The 20's setting is superb and a feel-good film with a twist - and the soundtracks damn good too! p.s. Robert Redford looks really sexy - well, come on, it was a long time ago!"
3,"Great movie, lousy transfer to DVD.","The movie is wonderful, but the transfer to DVD is not good. There are streaks and spots, as if they used a late-generation, very used print. And in the last 20 minutes, the sound goes haywire. There is a rustling going on, sort of like tape hiss. Also, the production notes on the disc are much worse than usual. They contain the average amount of information, but they are very poorly written. Universal should give this film the ""collectors series"" treatment it has so many others - with a restored print and updated sound. This movie deserves it."
2,Highly Overrated and Quite Bland,"THE STING is a highly overrated film in my opinion. Highly overrated. The overall production lacks a certain cinematic quality. Visually, it looks like meager made-for-television movie. It also looks like a vehicle to bring Robert Redford into the film-going public's eye. The plot is minimal and the pay-off, once viewed, is quite lacking drama or suspense. I am amazed at how little screen time Paul Newman has. He seems like a guest star in this film, yet he creates a very convincing character and gives an excellent performance. The same cannot be said of Redford who's performance is totally uninspired and unconvincing. Robert Shaw does the best he can with perfunctory lines he is given. One wonders what all the fuss was about. I disliked this film when I saw it on its initial release and now I understand why."
1,This is only about the 100th Anniversary Edition,"This is not about the movie. It was GREAT. This is about the ""book"" packaging.The Book is done well, the pictures and information excellent. Then they glued the plastic disc holders on each end. On one end of the beautiful book is a green background with a WHITE THIEF PROTECTION DEVICE under the plastic. To my knowledge, it cannot be remove without destroying the cover. Had to send it back. Someday they will wake up. ."
5,"""Sorry I'm late fellas...","This film is an absolute gem! It is one of the few movies from the seventies that hasn't aged a bit. Nothing looks dated, and no one has ever succeeded in making a film that ""stings"" the audience so well. One of Paul Newman's best."
5,Lightning strikes twice - A story about friends and loyalty,"I'm sure that many people thought that Paul Newman and Robert Redford were unlikely to be as successful a second time as they were in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID .This film proves them wrong - all they need is a great script , fine supporting players who are allowed their own moments in the spotlight and a good director .This film is about gambling - gambling with your life over proving a point to someone who did the wrong thing by one of your friends .The way the story unfolds is pure magic and is incredibly entertaining .I never tire of this great film - it communicates strongly and leaves you on a high .Some of those films considered the greatest are not necessarily the ones with a high replay factor . This film will continue to enchant generations to come .Watch it and see the best do what they do best ."
2,Disapointment totally,"I had seen this many years ago and truly had forgotten how not entertaining it was. I did not like the film and neither did my husband. It was not clear what was happening in the film. Wish I could give more stars, but I can not."
1,"Movie ""The Sting""","Bought this movie for my parent's, it's an oldie but goodie for them. The movie came in great condition & has been put away in the collection series!"
5,The Sting is still a classic,"Loved this movie when it was new and still adore it. Newman and Redford were perfect together and separately. The con they pulled was so elaborate that it still makes me laugh to think about it. This movie could be compared to the Oceans Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen. Lots of fun."
1,"no thanks for ""full"" screen","The studios have done it again: ruined a terrific film by releasing it in ""full"" screen only, as though they're doing us some kind of favor. Make no mistake: ""full"" screen is not ""full"" at all -- it's another pan and scan hack job. If you want to see the whole movie, you have to get the widescreen VHS version. The studio has not released it in widescreen DVD. It's inexcusable and it's a...."
2,Great Movie - LOUSY IN FULL SCREEN ONLY,"One of the truly great films of all time but was I dissapointed to see it only in full screen. If you love to watch movies as a TV director sees them, buy this DVD. If you want to see it as the director sees it tell the studio to put out a widescreen version."
3,"Good Movie, But DVD Issue","It has been correctly pointed out in previous reviews of this DVD that this DVD is not a ""Pan&Scan"" DVD. To understand why, see those reviews. However, as to what the explanation means, it means this - when watching this movie on DVD, you may be seeing the movie in a theatrical aspect ratio very close to the ratio intended by the director (1.37:1 was probably intended), or in the aspect ratio intended for television viewing by the filmmakers/film-producers/DVD producers, but you are not seeing the movie in its theatrical aspect ratio (1.85:1). If you're okay with that, enjoy!"
2,No Widescreen on DVD,This is my first encounter with a DVD that is not available in Widescreen format. The VHS version is available in Widescreen. I can't give a DVD higher than 2 out of 5 when the VHS version is available in a higher quality format than the DVD. That being said this movie has a well deserved spot near the top of the AFI's 100 greatest movies list. I love it. But I will be watching it on VHS in Widescreen.
3,Was it worth it?,"I hadn't seen The Sting is decades, so I didn't remember much of anything about it. My oldest son had seen it sometime back and just raved about it, so when I found it on HDDVD for a good price on Amazon, I decided to go ahead and spend some of my birthday money on it. However, although it is a really good movie, it wasn't worth it for me to have purchased it and have it take up space in my DVD cabinet. I try to get & keep only the ones I feel most necessary, and this isn't one of those. It's DEFINITELY worth renting and watching ... once a decade or so, but that's it for me. Now their Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid would be worth purchasing & keeping!"
4,fun but not as great as I remembered when I was younger,"Perhaps I have gotten jaded in my old age. I really loved this movie when I first saw it. I bought to have in my library of classic movies. Redford and Newman were great and the rest of the cats I liked. It was amusing and fun, but either because of a lot of movies like this one since then or the fact I had seen it several times, the ending was more blase' than I had remembered."
5,The Sting (Universal Legacy Series),One of the best movies of the 70's.It's wonderful.We enjoyed seeing again.
1,Defective Product,I ordered a HD copy of The Sting on DVD. The DVD would not load on my HD player. I returned the defective DVD and was sent a second HD copy of The Sting on DVD. The second DVD also would not load on my HD player. I returned the second one for a refund. I think you were sent a batch of defective HD DVD's. I am still awaiting my refund of the original purchase price.
1,sting,i bought this dvd for my husband on oct 15. we did not have chance to watch this dvd until 28 nov. but when we started dvd player it start to make noise and on screen it shows bad disk. so i try to returned the dvd however i could not send them out because it was over 30days. it said it will play on regular dvd so we tried on 3 different player but no go. i am stock with damage dvd. is anyone could help out!i could not find any phone # or e-mail only shows customer returned department address. anyway i am going to send this out to customer returned department and wait to see. this is a real stink!
1,Do you want to see part of a movie?,"The laser disc version of ""The Sting"" was in the ""full-screen"" format, and this new DVD simply copies the laser disc. But the movie was meant to be seen in widescreen. You only see part of the action in this fullscreen version, and often the parts clipped out at the sides are essential to enjoying the film. It is a total disgrace that Hollywood released this cut version. I hope the widescreen version comes out if enough people make their protests heard."
5,Great Masterpiece,"This movie is a classic. Fun, Newman is exceptional, Redford is playful, the cast is like watching a bunch a seasoned veterans not even trying but pulling off a great acting caper on us all. And Robert Shaw is brilliant.I'm not a big fan of the long drawn out one camera shot scenes from that era, but this was executed so well, that I didn't even notice it.It's no wonder this swept up so many Oscars. it was just that brilliant for its time, and has stood the test of time. Fun and exciting with a great climax."
3,So what is the original format for The Sting?,"Many reviewers have expressed dismay that The Sting appears in DVD only in Full Frame. Then at least two reviewers have tried to convince us that Full Frame was the way the movie was made and how it was intended to be. Some of the explanations are technical but semi-convincing.Meanwhile, the Widescreen VHS version says this on the box: ""To preserve the artistic integrity intended by the filmmakers, this film is presented in its original theatrical screen image of 1.85:1.""So who's correct?"
5,One of the Greatest films of all time!,"You want to own one of the best...then this is it. Okay, critics and commentators alike can point out inaccuracies with the setting/music/etc....but it works! This is the film that brought us all the ""con"" movies of today, plus you get great performances by starring and supporting players alike.If you have been thinking of owning this...all I can say is ""what has taken you so long?""\Enjoy!"
1,Good movie - bad DVD,"This movie happens to be one of my all-time favorites. I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD. Boy, was I disappointed. THE VIDEO QUALITY WAS HORRENDOUS. It was muddy, blurry, and loaded with scratches. Very distracting. I felt as if I was watching a well-used videotape.It's unfortunate that the quality is so poor, as this is fun movie to watch, if only for the colorful recreation of 1930's Chicago.I have purchased many older movies on DVD, and have often been amazed by the image quality (the cult-classic Two-Lane Blacktop comes to mind). In some instances, it was like seeing the movie for the first time. Not so with this P.O.S.In addition, the lack of widescreen is inexcusable, as is the lack of bonus material.In short: Don't be ""stung"". Avoid this DVD at all costs. Shame on you, Universal Studios."
3,Region 1 Widescreen DVD Available!!!,"I rated this DVD with only 3 stars because it's fullscreen. However, I JUST found a Region 1 Widescreen version of the DVD available at Amazon's Canadian website. As I just ordered it I can't rate the quality of the film or anything but I did want to let ""everyone"" know that it's out there. The website is: www.amazon.caHere are the specs on the DVD:Edition Details:* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)* Language: English* Theatrical Release Date: December 25, 1973* Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1* Picture Format: Anamorphic Widescreen* Subtitles in Danish / French / Swedish / German / Norwegian / Dutch / Czech / Finnish / Polish / Portuguese / English* Snap Case* Import* Catalog Number: UDR90052* ASIN: B00004SC8N"
2,This is not available in widescreen,"This is a great movie, but trust me. I have the widescreen Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid DVD, and The Sting is not done justice by the fullscreen format."
1,pan & scan P.U.,"What a waste to release a movie that is probably excellent in the pan & scan format. Who wants to watch a movie that is missing about 50% of the original film by being chopped off?! We agree wholeheartedly with the review ""WTF Pan & Scan?!?!"" We will NEVER buy or rent a movie edited by someone who is not the director. Film is an art and the director had very specific ideas and thoughts they wanted portrayed by their format and what a shame to ruin someone's artistic idea and hard work. Pan and Scan totally ruins many a good or great movie. Dressing it up with the more flattering euphemism ""full screen"" is simply misleading people who don't know any better."
1,"A GREAT Movie, but not WIDESCREEN","This is one of the great movies of the 70s. Perfect all around (screenplay, acting, music, direction...). So where's the 30-Year anniversary WIDESCREEN edition??"
3,the sting legacy series,"The only reason this movie gets a low rating was due to a damaged dvd, that had to be replaced. Otherwise this movie is in my personal top 100 movies of all time."
1,Great film reduced to unwatchable,"One of the most enjoyable films ever, begging for repeated viewings, unfortunately reduced to unwatchable for lack of a widescreen version."
1,"Wait for the ""whole"" movie",I'll chip in with another 1 star review of a 5 star movie. There is no excuse for releasing a classic movie such as this on a horrible pan and scan full screen DVD. Don't buy this until Universal releases the whole movie on DVD.
4,Excellent,"Superb performances by three great actors (Robert Shaw, Robert Redford and Paul Newman). A great plot. An excellent musical score.This film grips you from start to finish as one of the all time greats. The plot centres around a young con-artist who wants revenge following the murder of his mentor, friend and partner. With help from a big player who was also a former associate of the deceased he sets up an elaborate sting for the man responsible.The plot twists are great with a cameo sub-plot between Redford and Durning that entwines beautifully with the main story. As previously mentioned the musical score is wonderful, a re-working of Scott Joplin's Entertainer that really captures the mood of the film.This film was made to do one thing: entertain, and it does exactly that."
2,"AWESOME MOVIE, Cruddy DVD","Come one, A movie of this fame HAS to be seen in WIDESCREEN.I bought the DVD, and then found out it was Pan and Scan. What crud. I sent it back, and got my money back. Hey Hollywood, Make a lot of money and put it out in a Special Edition, Widescreen version. Then we'll buy it."
4,It was a gift...,"I purchased this as a 'just because' gift for a co-worker who said it was one of her favorite movies but she could never find it to buy. She was thrilled when it came in the mail and brought it to work the next day insisting that me and my family watch it first. She was right... GREAT, old-school movie that the whole family can watch and enjoy. :)"
4,The Cleverness of the Sting,"The Sting is a very witty film of the 70s, with a great cast (Paul Newman, Robert Redford.) This is one of my favorite movies, but this DVD is in wide-screen format, which is not as good."
3,This was NOT filmed in widescreen!,"A lot of reviewers are bemoaning the fact that this is not a widescreen release. Well, The Sting was not filmed in widescreen! It was filmed in standard Academy ratio (to keep its ""1930's"" feel, perhaps). I know that most movie databases list this movie as 1.85:1 (as most films were in the 70's), but I just saw this movie at a summer movie festival, and it was projected at 1.33:1 (academy ratio). If the DVD states that the picture was modified to fit your TV screen, then Universal really blew it with this notice! If a widescreen version is ever released, the top and bottom of the picture will have to be cropped to do it. That said, this transfer is the same as the laserdisc version, and that dates back to 1989. It wasn't a good transfer then, and it certainly is not a good one now. Universal needs to do a new transfer, but not in widescreen! Still, a wonderful and clever movie."
4,Fairly good Bluray of American Classic,"This Bluray arrived on time and was as expected. The video was a tad too soft for my taste because of Universal Studio's notorious use of DNR, but this classic survives intact and makes for a great revisit. Superb movie!"
4,"Focused on translations, not a study guide","It was my own error in assuming that this book might serve as a study guide. It is an elegant easy to read dictionary and glossary, but the organization is based on the Arabic and the original depiction of the Arabic word, followed by the English explanations, which appear to be superb. Bottom line: buy this only if you are reading the Koran in Arabic, and need a place to go from Arabic to English with fullsome explanations."
1,Not what it appears,Do you read and write Arabic? Then maybe this book is for you. Not what I expected and no where did the description specify I needed to be a student of writing Arabic. At the time I originally ordered there was no look inside the book.
5,sensational and inspiring,"Like his last masterpiece ""The Prayer Cycle"", Jonathan Elias has successfully inspired thoughtful minds with his moving music and his companions' profound words on ""American River"". This cd is a refreshing break from the superficial pop music we're constantly inundated with. He's created a great compilation of soft tracks and sweet words as this album satisfies the classical lovers' soul and the wandering heart. The music suggests a long transformation down the river of our history to the end where we find rebirth and renewal. What's also amazing about this album is that he's collaborated with such great artists, including the last ever recordings of Johnny Cash. I recommend this cd to all- for inspiration or mere enjoyment. When you get this cd, check out number 3 and 8. Top tracks for sure."
3,Long and complicated... :/,So here's what happened... I got this season 1 and went to play it and the first two episodes wouldn't work. So I notified the seller and he gave me a shipping label and I shipped him the old one and he sent me a replacement. The replacement had the same exact problem... BUT in the sellers defense he gave me a refund AND even let me keep one of the defective copies. Perhaps he just got a bad shipment...
4,wacky show about satan.,"this show is alot of fun , I picked up both seasons on dvd and the qualtiy is good for a dvd set. It's not blu ray but it's good. The show itself is a wacky horror series laced with alot of humour. In this series Satan is more like the warden of hell , rather than the force of evil who wants to destroy us all. He enlists his ""son' or maybe not! , to go after escaped souls, who are out doing evil. As played by Ray wise ,satan is a funny character to be sure and he even proudly says 'see I can do good!' or 'god wins in the end!' . So he sees himself doing gods work in a way. It works in this series as the reluctant spoiled slacker guy finds his place in the world tracking down the damned soulds. This one should have had more seasons than two for sure. Oh well , kevin smith even directs the pilot episode. SO you know where he's coming from and his influence is really strong in this series. So get reaping!"
5,Best Show On TV,"I cannot get enough of this show. Just picked up season one yesterday, and I am addicted to it. I hope they can keep up this momentum cos this truly is one of the better shows on TV. Long live Reaper!"
5,Best show in years!,"This is the BEST SHOW I have seen in years. It reminds me of Ghostbusters but with evil hilarious twists. Ray Wise is the best devil ever! He cracks me up everytime he pops up.I am not going to include plot synopsis or story details, you can get those anywhere.I just want everyone to give this show a shot. It's excellent and my entire family loves it."
2,"fun show, but....","The show was entertaining. The problem was that the second episode on the first disc was so corrupted that it wouldn't really play. I tried it on three different players. In the end, I managed to barely watch it on one player, however, I may as well not even watched for all the skipping I had to do throughout the episode."
5,Great for Teens & Parents,"Well, I didn't think this series was scary or gross; but has great humor, fantastic characters that all work well together and a good story line. I was SO sorry to see it go off the air; it's the one time I could get my teenage son into the same room w/ me for any length of time! I'm buying it for Christmas."
5,One of the best shows on TV,"Reaper is absolutely one of the best shows on TV. The WB made the perfect choice of Ray Wise to play the role of the Devil. Similarly, the network did a terrific job of presenting us, the audience, with a witty sidekick in Sock, played by Tyler Labine. Lastly, is it me or is Sam's girlfriend, Andi (Missy Peregrym), a prettier version of Hillary Swank?"
5,Contains all that is good about metal,"I bought this CD just when it came out. Must be two years ago or so, when I listened to metal and to nothing else. Now I have grown older and wiser and listen to other music as well but it happened that in the morning of new year's eve someone put that record in the stereo (hadn't listened to it for a year or so) and turned the volume to a splendid level and I realized just how this album rules. I would even say it is the best Death Metal album I that ever penetrated my ears. The vocals are absolutely excellent, the guitars are simple but groove like hell and the lyrics are even better than those of Cannibal Corpse. And by the way, there is nothing satanic about them at all. It's just splatter, blood and gore. This record rock'n'roll and nothing else."
2,eeeggghhh.....,"Ok this is the first six feet under cd I ever heard and I liked it when I first heard it so I got it... It was still good but after I got Haunted, Maximum Violence, and True Carnage and went back to this one somehow it lost what was good about it.... If you are EXTREMELY NEW to death metal just try out the cd if you like it get it and expand off it If you dont then try some other bands"
3,what the?,"How did this happen? Six feet under has been my favorite band for several years now. But this cd is just embarrasing. Chris must have had some bad weed for this one. It's not very heavy some songs just straight up suck! The lyrics are horrible as well. There are a couple of good songs though like ""4:20"" ""revenge of the zombie"" ""war is coming"" and ""death or glory"" these songs do remind you of why you became a sfu fan in the first place. Only for die-hard sfu fans."
1,this is not very good at all...,"as a fan of death metal, i am almost ashamed to admit that i bought this...thing. i guess this is what happens when someone takes themselves a bit too seriously. what are you doing, barnes? rapping(kind of anyway). this is absolute nonsense. if you like korn, but fashion yourself as a ""metal fan"" get this it is just the bridge that you are looking for; otherwise get as far from this page as possible and do not look back...future releases from this band, regardless of their pedigree, will probably only get worse..."
2,Six Feet Under at its weakest,"Maximum Violence is great and so is Haunted, but this, this I don't know...this pretty boring stuff. Haunted at least had some interesting songs and riffs, and Maximum Violence is probably Six Feet Under at its darkest and heaviest, but Warpath offers nothing but a couple of good songs and a bunch of yawns. The only real songs I liked on this album were ""War Is Coming"" and ""4:20."" That's about it, and those aren't really anything when compared to songs like ""The Enemy Inside"" (Haunted) and ""Bonsaw."" (Maximum Violence) So in short, this album can easily be passed by. Pick up Maximum Violence or Haunted. Warpath is for real hard-hard-hard-core Six Feet Under fans only."
2,BORING,"I admit I was interested in this album for the first 2 maybe 3 listens but after that this album just gets so boring. They play very few chords and the music is not very brutal and the vocals/lyrics are nothing threatening at all. This could best be described as stoner death metal due to their songs about grass and the overall laid back feel of this whole CD. I dont listen to this anymore unless I want to chill back and relax. I am more into the extreme forms of death metal.... Oh yeah Maximum Violence and True Carnage are much more brutal than this, this album was a mistake, should have never happened. Well, thats all I gotta say."
3,It's not Cannibal Corpse.,"This is not death metal. I saw a review for one of their albums that said ""Six Feet Under is Pantera with Chris Barnes singing."" That is an adequate description, indeed. The only songs on here I really enjoy listening to are ""4:20"" and ""Animal Instinct""....""Tomb Of The Mutilated"" more and more as the seconds tick by on the CD clock. ... Buy ""Tomb Of The Mutilated"" to hear the former Chris Barnes and some great music..."
3,Different...,"Warpath is very different from Haunted. The vocals are weird, too clean, and the lyrics often get repetitive. But it's Chris Barnes , and the oteher guys play well. Its a fine album, worst then Haunted, but it has its highlights..."
3,Good but not to everyone's taste,"This is a good CD, great to just lay back, relax and listen to, but in terms of death metal its a bit middle-of-the-road. There's nothing remarkable about the music but if you like mainly mid-paced death metal with a great, crunchy sound you'll probably enjoy this. There's not a huge amount of variatian between most of the songs, but for me the standout tracks are Burning Blood, Animal Instinct, War Is Coming and especially the excellent 4:20"
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"Watching grass grow. Watching Paint dry. Listening to Warpath. I would rather do the first two things. A complete lack of originality. Is it just me, or does the opening riff to ""Nonexistance"" sound almost exactly like Obituary's ""By the Light""? I think Allen West better quit ripping off riffs from Obituary for sfu. Waste of time? Yes! You can do a heck of a lot better with bands that are original and actually have there own sound!"
3,Average,"Six Feet Under's ""Warpath"" is the weakest of the SFU releases, but it is still worth a couple of listens. The first thing you will notice is the album is more laid back and it grooves, more like newer Entombed albums. It seems that Barnes was trying to create more a ""Stoner"" Death Metal album, and most of this album falls a bit short, as its just not the same without the harsh lyrics and bone crunching riffs. There are a few noteworthy songs here though, and considering the price of the album (3 bucks used) its worth it. I highly dont reccomend starting here though, I would add this last to your SFU collection. Its not a total disaster, average at best, but at least it didnt go in the direction Metallica went with Load and Re-Load. ENJOY"
4,Good reading by a great writer,"While he doesnt have the same finesse with these readings as I have heard from him in the past, the words are still the same beautifully crafted, and powerfull words they always were, if not even more important today. A must for a Ginsberg fan"
5,"He knew, and was one of, the greatest minds of his generation.","As a lesson in freedom of thought, this is the most important poem in American history."
5,"Allen Ginsberg, your friend and mine","Howl and other poems is a piece of history. Not only is it one of the most famous poetic works in the twentieth century, it's a very funny and entertaining work from Allen Ginsberg, the most famous poet from the Beat Generation.Like a wise reviewer said, ""Read it for yourself."" Heed that person's wisdom and indeed read it for yourself.But don't take my word for it, Thelonious Monk, the great jazz composer/pianist/bandleader, upon being asked by Ginsberg himself how he liked it said, ""It makes sense."" Yes it does.If there is only one reading you will do from the great Bohemian generation named Beat, make it this one. It is probably the easiest to read but On the Road and Naked Lunch are the perfect places to continue your Beatnik adventure. Why, those great three works of the beat generation, on the road, naked lunch, and howl and other poems are the only three things I learned in my dreadful junior year of high school that I'll ever remember."
4,school,for daughter. I can only say that the service and price were good. I bought it as a gift for my daughter
5,Allen Ginsberg - A mind in Synch with the Beat Rhythms.,"Ginsberg - The name flashes at you like some familiar face in a crowd of a thousand faces. He grasps every thread of the Beat Generation and embodies it in his work. The poem ""A Supermarket in California"" details a mystic journey into the thoughts of a Wandering writer who, in such a mind, asks "" ...and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?"" The book ""Howl and other Poems"" wonderfully pieces together some of the most enticing and thought-provoking works of Allen Ginsberg. This book allows you to sample poems from the reknowned ""Howl"", to the light airiness of""Asphodel"". At one time, Ginsberg was compared to the genius mind of Walt Whitman, by using the similar style of repetition in his poetry. Now, Ginsberg is noted for his own syle of Genius, and his use of ""mental tatalization"" that simply cannot be compared with any other, even those in the Beat Generation"
3,Allen Ginsberg Howl and other poems,"For some reason I thought this was going to be a large collection of poems by Allen Ginsberg. I can say I've been a fan for quite sometime. This was not the case. In fact, This book only consists of 57 pages. Its a very small book so I don't care how famous Howl is or if it's being made into a movie with James Franco. This is not worth the purchase of 6 or more dollars."
2,A Weak Work,"'Howl', like most -- perhaps all -- Beat poetry, has not aged well. It's a lazy, ugly poem which could have been written by any well-read and angry college kid. I have read it many times and see nothing in it of any value other than the historical."
4,Very Good!,Loved it! See alsoGeorge and Condi: The Last Decayed: A Collection of Poems from the Last DecadeBeaver Tales and a Canada Goosing: Poems Illustrating a Uniquely Canadian Perspective(See ArtisanPacificPublishing Website).
2,Beat Beat Beat and then bleated by the sheep !,"Beat Generation poetry. Obscene and profane, but is it great?This book is introduced by Williams Carlos Williams, a far better poet, who really should have known better than to pass Ginsberg's rants off as poetry.There is energy and youth evident in Howl, but there is also an abundance of hogwash and lies."
3,3 STARS FOR THE TALENT,"when season 2 started ,i predicted lukas rossi or the rocker girl who hurt her ankle before the final show as winners.lukas won out and deserved to.i would hardly call this a supergroup,save for tommy lee.gilby clarke is a great guitarist,and has some good cred behind him.jason newsted ...i dunno?there are no real memorable songs here,but lukas shines anyway.the show was great with dave navarro joining the stage at times to play and pimp himself.tommy miscalculated the crues busy schedule,and ultimately the band was put aside.headspin,written by lukas was the best song on the album,though some songs deserve a listen.for the price ,it is worth owning."
1,ewwww...,"Let me start with I don't care who won the Supernova contest. The project was ill-conceived from the beginning. Neither TL, JN nor GC served as the primary song writers in their respective ""money making"" bands. All have proven to be replaceable. Thus it begs the question: what is so super? That leaves me with LR, the extraordinarily overrated singer. Can I offer this review in ""odor-ramma""? If so, imagine the smell of vomit. I'd say about sums up my impression of LR singing ability. If you feel compelled to buy this CD, please do so with the understanding that you will be utterly disappointed and miffed for wasting your hard earned money. Give it a few months then look for it in the ""free"" bin at your local music store instead."
4,supernova?,"I have to admit that I wasn't a fan of the show, watched it a few times and that was enough for me. But it sparked enough curiosity I guess and I picked up the cd today. The songs aren't bad at all. A few really really cheesy lyrics (I was prepared for that though.. I have Butch Walkers last cd) but for the most part decent lyrics. Rossi's voice is pretty much different sounding on every track which is a blessing because you really can't take more then one song sung the same way by him if that makes any sense. I'm really happy I picked this one up. Four stars because the music is catchy, the lyrics are alright, the vocals are decent, and I didn't skip one song when I listened to the cd for the first time."
4,I think they are fantastic together!!,"Unlike the person who commented below...I DID watch the show and it was so much more to have seen the process they went through to find Lukas. He has such a wonderful voice and an even better stage presence. In fact, I recently went to see them when they toured in my area...and they were FANTASTIC!!! You can't beat the team, I mean Tommy Lee, Gilby Clarke, Jason Newstead (who isn't touring due to an injury) and Lukas. It's great. It's DEFINATELY not Metallica or Motley Crue...but it is it's own and that is all that matters. Together they are dynamic and I recommend the CD. It's better than most of the [..] being played nowadays."
5,check it out,"i didnt think much of a cd would come out of this but as a long time tommy lee fan i checked it out and its a pretty good cd and if you listen to it a few times it will grown on you trust me lucas does a few good songs that will make someone out ther who was a non believer a believer cehck out headspin very cool song i didnt vote for him on supernova but now might have thought twice wherever he goes after this , he will be good with the experiance he a has the ability to go far"
5,Met my expectations,"First off,this is not Metallica,Motley Crue or Guns N Roses and I am glad it isn't.I like the bands that Gilby,Tommy and Jason hail from,but this is a different sound than those.The three musicians play off each other well and the addition of Lukas as vocalist really sets them apart from other bands today.The songs are well written played and sung.I have listened to this CD many times and it just seems to get better with each listen.I hope these guys are around for a long time.Just open your minds,put all pre-conceived notions aside and enjoy."
4,A pleasant surprise - I'm glad I bought it,"My expectations for this album were cautious, since I questioned how serious Tommy/Jason/Gilby were about this project, but the whole album is solid, with several standouts - It's On, It's All Love, Headspin. In watching the show I was undecided who should win, but Lukas Rossi sings well on every song and actually sounds better on the album than he did on the show, with greater range than I expected. Too bad it doesn't seem to be getting much promotion - at my nearest record store it's shelved under Soundtracks rather than with regular albums - WTF? Hopefully this album will get some play and better promotion!"
2,Not What It Should Of Been,"This will be the first and last CD for this band. It sounds like they were just doing their ""job"" when this was created. With the history of the members of this band they should be able to get into a room and jam for hours and create something special however it did not happen.Instead you get a CD that now has Rossi as the stand out of the group. There were a few clues this would be the case as the members were not the most creative stand out members of their old bands in thier own right.I bought it with high hopes but as a musician I think I just expected much more from members of bands that will go on as legends in the industry.Headspin is the best song on this CD. It is the only one with emotion and it was created by Rossi. He will do better in his next band. I think Gilby, Tommy, and Jason took this project for granted."
2,Mediorce at best,"A great drummer, an excellent guitar player, and a terrific bassist combined with the hottest producer around would lead me to expect something something really great.Unfortunately the material lacks originality and the vocalist is as limited as I feared he would be when they selected him.Butch Walker seems to have squeezed all the fire out this record and Lukas lacks range and sounds thin and weak at times. This is just another hard rock record that has lots of the right attitude but lacks anything special."
1,Yuck,"I luv Tommy...I have luv for Gilby, but why oh why did they choose Lukas?!? I simply do NOT like this album."
2,Contrived and forgettable... this is NO 'supergroup'!,"Individually, these are noteworthy, respected rock musicians. BUT as a new unit, this stuff is average, at best. The whole thing sounds, well... contrived. Give me Ozzy (with Randy Rhoads), Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Saxon, Dokken, Ratt, Metallica, Motley Crue, Triumph, Loudness, Accept, Symphony-X, Firewind, Joe Satriani, Yngwie Malmsteen (Alcatrazz & Rising Force), Rainbow, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult, Kiss, Aerosmith, Rush, The Scorpions, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Who, Queen, Kansas... etc. etc. etc. over this nonsense anyday! 'Nuff said."
2,Does not go back far enough into time,"I purchased this book, hoping it would examine the _ancient_ Egyptian source of the ideas within the Corpus Hermeticum. But, in that respect this book is entitled in a misleading manner. The author is a researcher for the Center for _Greek_ and _Roman_ Antiquity of the National _Hellenic_ Research Foundation in _Athens_. And, as the name of his foundation clearly implies, his academic zeal begins and ends with Greece and Rome.Yes, everyone knows that the Corpus Hermeticum we now have was written by Greeks. But, my interest is in discovering the Kemetian source those Greeks worked from to come up with their Corpus Hermeticum. Alas, this book was no help."
3,Very enlightening as to that period of time in France,It was sometimes hard to follow the story line because of the lengthy descriptions of the times and the way people thought and reacted to them. Sometimes I would skip these lengthy portions and go back to them later.
3,informative,"Starts out very slow with a complete layout of Paris from the establishment of the city to the book's present day, intermixed with the lineage of rulers and their contributions to the city of Paris. I believe it was the authors intention to give a thorough portrayal of the history of the city, leaders, and architecture, but most of it was irrelevant and was stretched out beyond necessity. Once the storyline picked up, about a quarter of the way through, it became much more captivating. I would recommend briefly skimming the beginning to get the gist of things and then commence reading more in depth at the introduction of Quasimodo."
4,A chance to read a classic,I had never read this and decided to try it. I'm glad I did. It was a good tale with a picture of France in another era.
3,Ok,I found it hard for me to care about the characters. Good enough to actually finish reading though. Not the worse classic I've ever read.
3,Halloween Legends,""" He's simply, and purely evil"" --- How could anyone forget his face...and your blood?Using characters in a book that are not in the movie would somehow lower the standards of a great horror legend. When people see the character, they understand the character - they see qualities that a book cannot give them."
3,Halloween:The Old Myers Place was not bad!!,"Halloween:The Old Myers Place was okay. The story was good,but the problem was it talked too much about the teens. It was pretty boring the first 10 chapters but when Michael Myers came it was really good. It was nothing like the movies though. But it was good."
4,Pleased and satisfied,"I like the product for the coverage it provides. I thought it would make it fuller but it didn't. It was merely a coverup at best. There was no fullness or appearance of fullness at all. Overall I could spend less and get the same results, however it didn't come off on my clothing and it stayed on until I shampooed it out. Having it stay on and not run was very good and I will buy it again.Toppik Hair Building Fibers, Auburn, 0.36-Ounce"
2,Straight into the trash can!,"I have been growing more and more desperate over my thinning hair, to the point, apparently, of total stupidity. The proof of that is the money I wasted on this product. Reviewers advised me to order a shade lighter than my hair, so I ordered light blonde. Unfortunately, light blonde is the exact same color as my scalp, so the powder did absolutely nothing for me other than rain all over the counter, and my shirt, and make me sneeze! If it weren't so overpriced for what is essentially colored talcum powder, I might be sucker enough to buy a shade or two darker than my light blonde hair and try again. But, times being what they are, I'm going to give it a pass."
5,toppik hair building fibers,Works great for people with bald spots. Covers nicely and doesn't glaringly say COVERING BALD SPOT. Seems to blend nicely
2,toppik hair building fibers,"this was to be light brown but looked black on my scalp and doesn't spread once applied to an area, i quit using it."
5,This really works for hiding balding spots.,"I tried this product for thinning baldness. I am not bald, but have signs of beginning male pattern baldness where the white scalp is beginning to show through. I followed the directions and sprinkled it on the back of my head where my hair is getting very thin. I then patted it down and used regular hair spray to hold it in place. The next day it still looked good. Family members noticed the improvement immediately, but didn't know exactly what I had done until I told them. My grown daughter also used it on a wide hair part, and it made it look much better as well. I won't use this every day (because I'm not that vain), but for the days I want to disguise the inevitable balding, I'll pull it out and use it. (Warning -- it isn't water proof -- so if you get caught in the rain your secret won't be a secret anymore! LOL)."
3,Toppix,"I can see how this might work for someone with a minor bald spot in the back of the head. The fibers do stick to the hair and give the appearance of more hair. It's not really meant for someone with a short or buzz cut. Also, be very careful in the rain or you can be easily embarrassed - especially if you touch your hair and your hand turns brown, along with everything else you happen to touch."
5,Gave confidence,"Changed my life and gave me confidence. My hair is thin on the crown, Toppik hair building fibers cover the thinning areas and make hair thicker. Easy to use, stays in well and washes out easy. I will never be without this product. Highly recommend."
5,Wouldn't use anything else,I love this product. It gives me so much confidence when I go out in public. It covers thinning areas very well. I would recommend this to anyone who is thinning and can not pay for a hair transplant.
5,"Even though pricey, it works great","This stuff works incredibly well. It took me a few tries to find the right combination to make it work, but when I did it was great.Here's what I discovered, and I hope this helps anyone out there looking for answers...I am a male with short hair thinning at the crown area. When I first applied the product I tested it without any hair spray and it rubbed off far too easily to be useful wearing out of the house. I tested a variety of sprays to see what works best, and I've found that applying the fibers then using ""Aussie Freeze"" extra hold hair spray locked them in place all day and night. Ive applied in the morning, gone throughout my day, slept at night, and woken up the next morning with the fibers still in place even with messy bed head hair."
1,FACT !!! Toppik contains Ammonium Chloride and DMDM cost to lose your hair,"After my hair transplant the doctor explained me that my hair transplant wouldnt fall off. Ive been using Toppik since then and i have noticed that am losing my transplanted hair, I asked my doctor, Martin Behnke and he explained me the reason might be due to the usage of toppik and to stay away from any product that contains Ammonium Chloride and DMDM he recommended me Hair Cubed and another product i dont recall the name but i have to say i dont have money its a little to expensive for me. So here am spending a fortune on hair transplant and to my luck a bottle of toppik cost me to lose nearly half of my expensive hair."
5,Excellent Product,"I have tried different ways and products to hide the areas of my head where my hair has thinned. They have been messy and made my hair look dull and drab. Toppik is very easy to use, and covers excellently! I was so pleased with how quickly I can apply, and how well it covers, that I purchased it for two other women I know who have the same problem. We are all very happy with it, and highly recommend it to others who want to cover balding areas."
5,Work Great!,"I see my Dad's head full with hair. I will go off if you touch hard but the wind will not blow it away. Avoid raining, it will go off if you wash with water. However, it will help your parents be much more confident in the party. 5 stars!"
3,Perhaps,"Initially I was thrilled to have temporary fix for my bald spots; but then I noticed that it goes on like a dry black dust (I use the black) thus making my hair seem dusty and dry.I will continue to use sparingly.All in all I like the fact that it hides, but I don't like the resulting dustiness. Any suggestions?"
5,Toppik Hair Building Fiber,This is the BEST spray that has come out for covering up your scalp. It is not only for thinning hair but for thick hair as well to cover up your part on the top of your head. It makes it look fuller and you don't see your bald line. Too Awsome. Recommend for EVERYONE! Love this product and the great Customer Service for this entire order :)
4,great product,This is a great product & was a good price! Doesn't always end up where you're trying to put it.
4,toppik hair fibers,I used this prior to using viviscal hair vitamins. Now I no longer use it because I feel the Viviscal has worked for me to regrow hair.
2,It is ok,"This product just covers the thin areas by providing color. I have been applying it for the past 3 weeks. However, didn't notice any change really"
2,i don't like it,I was not happy with it. The product just covered the scalp and did not look like real hair upon closer examination. I think it's an over-sell.
3,Difficult to use,"I knew this wouldn't be the answer to my prayers, but I didn't expect it to be so difficult to use. As I ""dusted"" it over my bald spots, it would stay in one area rather than evenly distributing. Maybe with some practice, I will get better at it. Also, if you have very thin hair, I don't think this will fill in the open areas very well....there are too many of them!"
1,Turns Green!,I bought this after hearing good reviews on toppik. I guess this color specifically turns green on your scalp. I found out after the fact. It looks like ashes. Horrible and a waste of money. Wish I could send it back.
2,Great in your 40's,My hair dresser introduced me to TOPPIK to go along with my Rogain. Both are great but together over time they have cured 80% of my hair loss isses which is amazing. A little TOPPIK on your scalp dulls and colors your exposed skin and thats all i needed to solve the ballance of my issues. Works good
5,Review of Toppik,Really love this product! I have mild-moderate hair loss on the top of my head. I use it after I have styled my hair to fill in where my scalp shows through. It covers the spots and looks very natural.
4,It works surprisingly well!,"I'm a bit discouraged by my hair loss and that's what resulted in my purchase of this product. I didn't expect it to work very well but I was pleasantly surprised. It's easy to apply and virtually unnoticeable, which is a good thing. When I'm using it I'm a bit worried about the rain but I've used it before going to the gym, which is an intense, sweat-producing endeavor for me, and it held up well. I'll use it if I'm going out or have a job interview but I don't use it very often. I think your best bet is to use this in conjunction with rogain and/or propecia because as your hair loss progresses your success with this product will diminish.My ultimate advice, get comfortable with shaving or buzzing your hair very short, this is only a temporary, superficial solution."
3,good quick solution,"Its a good solution for quick fix. it gives you what you need of having thick hair.Since its like a powder, you have to use much of it to cover the needed areas.Don't use it in case water would reach your head."
1,"Claims to be ""sending soon""",Don't order from this company unless you plan on waiting until the cows come home. 4 days after placing my order & the product has not been sent. What kind of customer service is this? It's the kind that sends me the other way.
3,Just okay,"Does an okay job. Color covers well on scalp which makes hair look thicker, but doesn't cover gray very well."
1,it's totally a lie,never trust it as magic as the advertisement shows....barely work even you have some hair on the top....the powder just didn't stick to the scalp at all..NOT Recommend to purchase...
2,Not so good.,I work out and when my sweat mixed with these fibers i found that the color bled out of them. I had to run to the bathroom several times to wipe away the dark green streaks that were making their way down my face. Similar products that I have tried did not have this contraindication.
3,It covers well if you have enough hair on your head,When I first used it I had enough hair to make it look good. Now a year later it just looks fake on my hair. It also gives me headaches when I use it and leaves clumps of black.
4,Great,Bought this for a customers hair that was thinning on top.Color was a great choice and fill in remarkably well
4,Toppik hair cover for bald spots or cancer patients,Toppik works great for this cancer patient. It can be a lil messy but glad it works! You put a generous amount of Toppik on your bare spots on your head. Covers then up nicely!
3,You really need the whole kit.,"Meaning that there is some sort of fixative spray available, you probably want to buy that although I haven't. Without it, this product tends to disappear quickly, although it works reasonably well at the start and blends nicely, the color is right for my reddish brown hair."
4,it really works,I have reviewed this previously and have been using it for over a year( I am a woman with thinning hair since menopause). This stuff does actually disguise thinning areas on my scalp and as a bonus it also covers my gray roots. I use a combination of dark brown and medium brown to get a more natural effect. It lasts until I shampoo again.The only con is that it does get all over the bathroom counters but it's easily wiped up with a damp sponge.
3,spendy,This product seems to work but for me it is too expensive to use for the extent of the problem I have and then every time you wash your hair it has to be redone. The vendor was good and delivered the item as ordered in a reasonable time.
1,No No No,"Even with the spray made to make the fibers stay in place, they do not.The fibers do rub off on pillow at night and you wake with them all over your face. The fibers brush easily off the pillow case and brush easily out of your hair. So don't plan to brush your hair while out in public. Also the spray makes your hair as stiff as broom stray. Totally an awful experience."
1,Does not stay put!,"Even when using the sprayer accessory, these fibers do NOT stay where you put them. I tried using it to cover up thinning hair along my front hairline and would have dark dust on my fingers after touchng my forehead - this product makes you look like there is chimney dust falling from your hair. If it would stay in place, I think it would be a decent cover-up. The claims of it not coming off when it gets wet seem incredibly false to me - all you have to do is shake your head and they will sprinkle down onto your face. Also, it looks 'fake' when under direct light."
5,Great Product,This is great product for people who loosing hair or on the medical process. This would retain the confidence as you are in good sharp. Highly recommend !!
4,Works well.,"This product works quite well. I have fine curly hair, so I probably have a little more trouble with getting it where I need it to be. It does stick to the hair and part of the scalp. As long as it makes it seem that I have more hair than I actually do, then I'll continue to use it until I find something else that works better."
1,Useless product! Don't waste your money,"What a waste of money! I bought it based on the youtube video and the product seemed to be an amazing fix. I dont believe that video at all, must have been doctored digitally. This product is like putting dust in your hair. do you really want that! and it shows! ewww!"
4,Good,The product is as described and arrived within a reasonable time. Overall I had a good experience with this oroduct.
5,Could Not Manage Without Toppik,"My aunt shared the secret of appearing to have a full head of hair!!!My hair is extreamly thin on top. So bad if I hadn't found this amazing product I would still be wearing a hair piece. I'm a very prideful person, never go without makeup.So the appearance of my hair is very important to me as most women. Using Toppik is absolutely magical!! No one would ever know all this hair is not natural and comes in a can!! I can't say enough about Toppik Hair Building Fiber. I've been using it for about 3 years and Amazon is the best place to order it from. Thank you so much for listing such a wonderful product.Thanks Again,Judy from North Carolina"
4,toppik great for small bald areas too,Great product for covering the bald are in the back of my head...also good forthe few days between coloring my hair.
5,It works!,I've been thinking about doing a hair transplant to fill in those thinkin spots but a friend recommended toppik and i am totally satisfied and highly recommend it.
5,Reaaly works,"I used this product last month, now I satisfied with this. IT REALLY WORKS WELL.Nobody recognized I used this. I like this."
1,Doesn't work (at least for me). Waste of money.,"If you have a lot of hair on top of your head to begin with, this might be of some use. Having only a fews wisps up there it was just like painting my head. Stupid!"
5,This is the best product for thinning hair EVER!!!,My hair stylist introduced me to this product about a year ago and I am absolutely hooked. I have recommended it to so many women with thinning hair. It is absolutely remarkable. Now my husband is using it. It looks completely natural and it only takes 1 minute to apply. This is my all time favorite beauty secret. I'd rather forget my make up than my Toppik.
1,"Buyer be aware, this produce can cause loss more hair","4 months ago, I purchased 2 bottles of TOPPIK hair fiber based on all the good reviews that I read from others. After using it for 2 months I noticed my hair loss getting worsen especially on the hairline area. I immediately suspected it had to do with TOPPIK. Then, I went online did an intensive search and found a few blogs that mentioned this produce can actually cause you loss more hair when using it for some people. I immediately stopped using it and my hair loss slowly back to normal pace not as intense as it was when i was using Toppik. Currently, I am on a laser treatment. It seems to maintain my existing hair. BUYER BE AWARE TOPPIK CAN CAUSE MORE HAIR LOSS FOR SOME PEOPLE WHEN USING IT."
3,Toppik - Black Giant Size,"Compare to other hair fibers I have used:1. color is not really black, looks more like dark gray to me, totally different from my real black hair2. texture also don't mesh well like the other products I used before3. can't see through bottle to see the remaining amount inside"
3,Color Problem,"The worst thing about this product is getting the correct color. I can't seem to get it right! Either it is too dark or too light. It DOES show if it is the wrong color. I tried mixing some Medium Blond (too light) with some Medium Brown (too dark). I also have Light Brown, but it is too grayish. Now I have a big mix that I could never duplicate. I ""shoot"" it into my scalp with the spray applicator and hope the hair around it will blend. I am only looking for it to add a fullness to my thinning hair. I can't imagine it working on a large balding area."
4,Great with a few drawbacks,"I am SO glad I finally found something that covers up my slightly thinning hair. This stuff is exactly what I was looking for. It darkens my scalp so that it looks like my hair is continuous. I have the dark brown and light brown, and both look pretty good depending on how long my hair is. My only complaint is that sometimes it clumps up and may fall onto your shirt. If it does this, especially in sunlight people will start wondering what is in there. Also, be careful when you put it on....you can easily breathe in the particles. My lungs hurt the first day I had this and I finally figured out why."
1,DO NOT USE IT!!,"I used the this product powders I lost more and more hair, after researching I found out DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCT CONTAINS AMMONIA!!!"
2,Wrong color,I thought I ordered medium brown. This is the wrong color - way too dark for me. Wish it was right!
3,Not exactly what I expected...,"The fiber don't adhere to my hair as well as I would like. I think I needed to buy the hair spray, but once you do get them in place, they seem to stay there. I'm keeping it."
5,I've used this for a couple of years now...,I love it. The coverage is complete and it stays until I wash it out. The price is good too!
5,It works,"This product looks natural, stays in place, and works to cover the scalp and thicken my thin, fine, hair. I use it everyday."
5,40 yr old thinning part and bangs,"I love this. I have beginning thinning.. Can see through to scalp, age appropriate for someone with thin hair to begin with. It's not 100% perfect but it stops my incessant looking at my hairline in mirror and pics - that alone made me feel confident. I did the transitions hair where they add 4 hairs to one strand with great results but expensive and last 6 weeks. I am thrilled this option as cheaper and in between if necessary. I wore my hair down- I usually side pin my bangs to deceive my thickness and avoid seeing my scalp but it is getting old and I wanna wear side bangs without seeing my scalp. It made me happier and less self conscious."
1,does not do what it should do,its just powder that clings to your hair dont get wet at all cost wish it could have done better
1,dangerous,"I used the black variety, a few days after I used it I noticed a strange blue-black colour in my nasal mucous . The strange colour disappeared after a week of discontinued use. The active ingredient is probably carcinogen. I reported the adverse reaction on the FDA form. I don't expect any action from the Agency as this agency is grossly inefficient and is paid off under the table. Good luck, you're on your own in this beautiful country of the U.S. of A.Toppik Hair Building Fiber Dark Brown"
2,Misled by photo and disappointed..,"I have been a Toppik user for many years now and have enjoyed the use of their products. I was upset though when I received my purchase that it was not at all as it was shown in their advertisement.They had a picture of a larger size of the Toppik, 25gm, yet I was sent the small one, 10.3gm?I was not very pleased to say the least when I open the package..Besides being mislead, the product itself is fine.."
1,Beware!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS IT IS FROM DIRECT MFG. THAT WILL GIVE YOU MONEY BACK IF NOT SATISFIED!! I bought this from the natural health shoppe, and I got stuck keeping a product that doesn't work-they would not refund any opened product!! How else was I going to see how it worked? I guess this is good for people that have used it without any problems or are satisfied with this product."
5,An Easy and Enjoyable Read,"Lou Gehrig has always been a hero of mine even though I am not a Yankee fan. I have always be enamoured with the mythical Lou Gehrig and wanted to understand him as the person behind the myth and when I came across Eig's book I bought it without even opening the cover. Needless to say I am glad I did.Eig's writing style flows and as a result I rapidly flew through this book much faster than I had anticipated. It is a very easy and readable book that fills out the life of Lou Gehrig, giving insight into his personal life as well as his public one.I came away from this book with a much better understanding of Lou Gehrig and his times as well as an even deeper admiration for the man that I wish more athletes, both young and old would emulate."
4,"Great read, historically accurate",The book progressed well with a good pace through each season.The use of previously unknown letters added more than just standard fare. It would be more interesting if his complete medical records existed and if his parents and associates had lived in an era when complete oral histories were done without embellishment.
4,"I'm 14, so call me a kid if you want","This book was the best biography I have ever read. I absolutely hate the Yankees with all my heart, but this book makes you love the Yankees a little bit more. Eig gave a good balance of personal life and baseball life where he excelled in both. The only complaint I have is that the 2-3 chapters of ALS coverage was really boring. All the letters to read were a pain and I just wanted to get done with it, but don't be discouraged to read it because everything else is flawless."
1,Too many people's quotes.,"From the Gary Cooper movie, I thought this would be a great book. I was disappointed. My biggest beef was how anyone who Eng found that ever crossed the shadow of Lou Gehrig was quoted. It was almost as silly as ""Bill Smith was a peanut vendor at Yankee Stadium and Gehrig once spoke to him...."" It got ridiculous. Please don't quote other people. Write me a narrative. I threw the book away since it had no resale value and read Ray Robinson's book instead. Totally better. A joy. My favorite baseball author is Roger Kahn. Can't touch him. Of course I'm a Dodger fan."
2,"Great book, but buy a hardcopy.","I gave the book a 2-star review because there are no other reviews that low, so this one might be read. Actually, the book itself is masterfully written. I was 4 months old when Lou Gehrig died. I love biographies and baseball books and this is one of the best of both.My problem with the Kindle edition is that it costs more than the printed editions and contains no photographs at all. I wouldn't mind that if I were told that some of the money would go into ALS research (none does).Moreover, the one graphic, a single sheet of Gehrig's baseball lifetime stats is in a type font so tiny that it can't even be read when enlarged.Still, I read the whole book so it would be dishonest to return it for a refund. And I feel no shame in writing that Chapter 23 made me cry.But if you really love baseball, get a printed copy. (I can't do that. We are retired and living in Dominica. The wretched Kindle is our only book option other than the equally inadequate Nook.)"
3,Comprehensive look at one of the greats,"I truly enjoyed Eig's meticulously researched book. I was unaware of the relationship between Babe Ruth and Gehrig, and this book solidified my previous view that Lou Gehrig was one of the greats in the American amphitheater of professional athletes. It's sad that today's adolescents don't have sports heroes of the same high caliber and character.One unrelated element that turned me off was the author himself. I took the opportunity to meet him at a local book signing and gave him a brief note asking if he might e-mail me so that I could ask for some writing advice for a book project of my own. I never heard from him, which was kind of a disappointment for me. Usually, writers are a tight community of gracious individuals who don't hesitate to help others' out, but with Eig, this didn't seem to be the case..."
5,Excellent!,"I found this book to be an excellent history of Lou Gehrig's life.It was the right mix of stories, statistics and photos. It takes the reader through his childhood, the consecutive games streak and then his untimely death. How ironic that a man known as the ""Iron Horse"" would be no match against ALS now known as Lou Gehrig's disease. I am not an avid reader but found this book to be a page turner and would recommend it highly."
4,A moving biography of a great sports hero,"I am new to baseball and this was a wonderful way to begin. A moving biography of a great player and a great man, not to mention one of the golden ages of Yankee history."
4,fun,"Tunng is a band of six from London who create full, layered, atmospheric, and quirky music. Sometimes they remind me of the Super Furry Animals with lots of harmonizing, layered vocals, and electronics.Bullets (4) is my favorite track from this album, it's very atmospheric and attention grabbing. Soup (5) is also an excellent track which is mostly instrumental that goes crazy after they yell ""SOUP!"" and then there's lots of xylophone and guitar. Take (1) has some clapping and kind of reminds of me the Rosebuds. There are reverbed vocals, some recorded voices, and some electronics in Bricks (2). The more folky sounding tracks are Hands (3), Spoons (6), King (7), and String (10). Arms (8) has an interesting drum beat."
3,Functional only,"This set was purchased because it does not skip sizes (other than 9mm). It was made in India, and judging from this set, they are below the Chinese on the learning curve. [The sets from HF are significantly better in quality, but have the annoying feature of skipping sizes!] For example, the chrome plating on this set is uneven and porous, evident from even casual observation, and not all wrenches in the set were stamped with the same brand name. But they work OK for what they were meant to do, turn nuts and bolts."
3,Metric wrench Set,"Wrenches are good enough for occaisional use. One of the wrenches was omitted from the set. How can that problem be addressed, I do not know."
4,Dorothy Malone: Hot Stuff,"Dorothy Malone could really look hot in her day. Man, sometimes he outdid Marilyn Monroe for sex appeal......sometimes. One instance might be here in this movie.This film also had some fascinating and dramatic flying scenes, things I have never seen before on film. Apparently, they had these 1930s air races in which planes few around pylons, almost like a horse race on land. This is the only film I've seen that pictured.Another thing I enjoyed was Rock Hudson's dramatic story at the end of the movie which, at first, seemed ridiculously melodramatic but was said so well that I found in very compelling, and it tied the whole story together.****possible spoilers**** I also appreciated Malone doing the right thing at the end, telling off Hudson for coming on to her, since she was a married woman. This is one of the few films - including those in the 1950s - in which adultery is NOT treated mater-of-factly."
3,i thought it was kool but not as good as some.,if i could hear some of it maybe i could rate it but what i heard it sounds ok.
3,A little thinner than I expected,"These were OK. The size was what was stated. They were a little thinner than I had expected. They held the party gifts, but a couple of them did tear down the seam."
3,Escapism,"I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this is not one of MacLean's best. Realistic story lines have never been one of MacLean's strong suits, but this one can get a little ridiculous at time. The plot never really seems to go anywhere, and in my opinion, the ending is very disappointing. The book is entertaining, however, and an easy read. If you are a MacLean fan, this book would be alright for you. However if you are new to the author's works, start somewhere else: ""Where Eagles Dare"" or ""Guns of Navarone""."
5,Alastair MacLean Fan,"This book is classic Alastair MacLean! The action is non-stop but it is blended with the characters in such a way to make them come alive as it keeps the plot plausible. It is not just ""action for action's sake."" I know this is an older book but it is well worth the time is takes to read it!"
2,Alistair MacLean - South By Java Head,"My least favourite book from MacLean's early period (HMS Ulysses through to Last Frontier.) The plot lags through the middle section of the book, and then finishes too fast. However, it is well written and contains the usual MacLean theme of men fighting against seemingly unbeatable odds and pushing themselves to the limits of their physical and mental endurance. Worth a read for anyone who is a MacLean fan. Otherwise, don't bother."
5,GORGEOUS SHOES!,THESE SHOES ARE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS AT EXCELLENT PRICE. I SAW THEM AT ANOTHER DOTCOM FOR $182.00... BOUGHT THEM HERE FOR APPROXIMATELY $28. I WILL MOST DEFINITELY SHOP HERE AGAIN!
5,For anyone who has ever questioned if we are alone.,"This book is an EXCELLENT reference book filled with information such as documents that give evidence that we are NOT alone. It also tells about how the government is methodically hiding this information from the world. Don't be fooled!! Read this book and you will change your mind. I highly recommend this book to anyone fascinated with UFOs and aliens. It's not philosophy, it is a FACT. ""If there is no life out there, it sure is an awful waste of space!"""
4,Great Idea,Us older folks need floss all the time. I've been looking for singles like this for some time...since crest stopped marketing glide singles.
5,different and awesome!,"Finally, musicians with real talent. This CD is fun. Every song is different and catchy - my favorites are #2, 3, 4 and Yummy Tomalito!!"
5,Masterpiece,I am a prog rock and metal fan and I just need to say that this disc is a masterpiece and Matheos is a genius. This work goes beyond genres IMHO. It is beautiful throughout.
2,"A Concept cd. For a Fate's warning cd, it would be 0 stars","With the exception of the first two cd's, I have every Fates cd released, and this is the only one I don't like.It is a concept cd that is BORING and Monotonous, comapared to other Fate's cd's.Unlike Savatage's Streets cd, a concept cd that contains some great songs that gets dragged down in other songs trying to complete the concept, this cd contains some good songs, but mostly filler in trying to complete the conceptIf this was done by another less talented band, it could have turned into a cd to cure insomnia, thankfully Fates Warning does not achieve this, but something you could play as a compromise for somebody that totally hates hard/progressive rock and and would like to listen to Kenny G.NOTE - beware, one cd of double cd Still Life, contains this album, so buy that one for only the second cd, which contains excellent stuff of their past matieral"
2,Does Not Live Up To Expectations,"""A Pleasant Shade of Grey"" is a semi-concept album that is basically one song divided into many smaller parts. I'm not sure why this is classified as progressive metal, because while it certainly is progressive, it is definitely not metal. There are very few crunchy riffs and two melodic, but ultimately boring solos. This is better described as progressive/ambient. What I love about progressive metal is that you can get all pumped up and still think at the same time. This definitely makes you think, but it is about as exciting as watching paint dry. If I wanted to think and be bored I could read one of my high-school textbooks. If ambient stuff is your thing (and you like those weird Pink Floyd songs like the ones from ""The Wall"") you should pick this up. But if you are looking for adreniline-pumping progressive metal, look elsewhere, like Andromeda or Savatage."
3,"Good music, if you have trouble sleeping.","Don't get me wrong, I think that this is a good album. The musical creativity and awesome lyrics make each part diffrent. But, this is a really good album if you want to go to sleep! I'm sorry, but there is no hook! There's no part in this ""song"" that makes me give it 5 stars. Not enough distortion is, uh, probably the major lack on this album. But, I'll have to say this, it really goes along with a prog-fan's collection."
3,Interesting Historical Church Perspective,An interesting historical look at covenant life and church doctrine at the middle of the 20th century.
2,Good for Entry Level Users,"If you are familiar with MS Office any version, you could do without this book. It does not elaborate on any aspect of these applications."
3,A Lucky Bit of Sympathy,"I picked up this one at a book signing I stumbled onto in 1998. The author looked exhausted and disappointed in the nearly deserted bookstore. I admit, it was a pity buy, but I really enjoyed the novel of this emotionally itinerant woman and how she got where she went. Ms Monroe uses a non-linear story line quite effectively to tell the tale of Maidie and her mother, a fascinating woman who just wandered off one day. It's a very pleasant read even if occasionally the transitions seem disjointed. It's now in the realm of bookcrossing.com hopefully inspiring other readers to look into more of Ms Monroe's work."
1,Bad disc,"I was really looking forward to watching this like all the other Rifftrax dvds I bought from Movie Mars Inc..All of the orders I made came to me in great shape except this one.""RiffTrax: Little Shop of Horrors - from the stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000"" seems to beheld together by the sticker on the dvd. It freezes and won't play. It crackles when you hold it likeit's very fragile or shattered under the sticker label. It doesn't even feel like a normal dvd, it feels lighter.Is there anything that can be done about replacing it with a better copy?"
4,Air Simulation,This is a good game but extremely hard. This game is good for people who like flying/fighting games. I also like it because of the choices of planes they give you.
3,Not a CD for Dreaming,"With a title like ""Tahiti: Dream Island"" one would expect music reminiscent of Stewart Copeland's soundtrack to the movie ""Rapa Nui."" However, the music on this CD is more like a festive evening with Don Ho. It's very upbeat, but with a strong Western influence - i.e. not a lot of drumming or ethnic instrumental usage.Overall, it's OK. But, not anything close to what I was expecting."
5,"Hey Man, come on sing my song with me....","Not much to say. Just that a random pick up from Los Angeles public library of this album has led me to an obsessive purchasing/procuring of many Zucchero CDs. Great music, great combination. This CD introduced me to a variety of singers (Cheb Mami, Randy Crowford, John Lee Hooker ...). This CD also made me read about its contributors and to learn quite a few very interesting facts (for example, I have read that Brian May, as an astrophysicist, had a paper published in Nature, and that he had, in principle, fulfilled all the requirements to be qualified for a PhD in physics, or, for that matter, that Andrea Bacceli is blind and has a PhD in law) and to exclaim at the broad range of singers Zucchero has sung with.Excellent album, a must have."
4,An enduring classic,"Covers: 1) The relative worth of the pieces; 2) Most every type of pawn position ever known ( the most instructive part of the book); 3) The Struggle for open lines ( open files; the minority attack; Controlling open files etc.); 4) Weak PawnsDespite what the publisher says above, this is not a book for the novice.The concepts are subtle. ( The games given illustrate the author's points, and should be studied in the general framework that the author's present.) The best part of the book is the explanatory prose at the start of each chapter. It is general in nature, but then borne out ny the games that follow.The binding is horrible. My book is in two pieces with several pieces of tape holding various parts of the first half of the book together. Minus 1 star for that."
4,landry's law,One of the best books I've read. Can't wait until the rest of the Landry Brothers series comes out. Trying to find Bedside Manner also by Kelsey Roberts. Keep the series coming!
4,A great read,kelsey Robersts in the best Harlequin Intrigue writer. Her books are always as romantic as they are suspensful. Brava Ms.Roberts you did it again.
4,"good quality, lightweight sign holder!","This sign holder is slightly slanted, and the base is about 2.5 inches from front to back. The slant makes it easier to read if it's sitting on a counter or desk.The acrylic that this is made with is very good quality; it's very clear, about 1/8 inch thick and quite light weight.If your sign holder will be in an area where it will get jostled around a whole lot, or will be subjected to heavy use, you might want to consider a heavy weight sign holder.However, if, like me, you just need a sign holder for ordinary, light-use purposes, this sign holder will work fine. I'm very pleased with it and wouldn't hesitate to buy another. (In fact, I'm now planning to buy this same brand in a couple other sizes as well.)"
3,The crack easily,"These served their purpose, but they do crack easily. Also, you can only use them in the vertical position. The papers fall out if you lay them on their side."
4,Pure Black Metal by masters of the Pagan Cycle,"Ancient has lost their original lead singer, Grimm, and attained Lord Kaiaphas. Aphazel's guitar and bass is not too complex, but they give a real neat and primal mood. Kaiaphas' vocals are higher and almost 'eviler' than Grimm's, with a clearness that is quite amazing. Though the guitar sounds pretty much the same through the whole album, it is easy to listen to. The second, third and fourth songs are the tale of Cain and his exile from Nod, with six different voices for the characters of Cain, Lilith, Adam, Michael, the crone and the narrater. A good Black Metal album with a few neat synth and keyboard tracks. More old school, and great cover art. END"
2,Disappointing,"The irony of the title is that the ratio of editorial/descriptive text pages to recipe pages is pretty. There are a number of chapters, each with a general 2-3 page introduction and then 5-10 pages of recipies that can be modified to suit your taste.I think a much better investment is Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything. It has just as much on the tips/techniques side (and I think better quality) and far more on the recipies (if you're interested in them)."
2,Not worth the money,This may be the book for beginners if they are into childish text. This is not the book I had hoped. The recipes are not that great.
3,Fabulous Title,"The format offers a big picture of cooking. However, it is a cookbook like all the rest in that it is explains how to cook. She organizes things well, just as Joy of Cooking does, or Moosewood Cookbook. I was ready to buy it until I read the tomato sauce recipe. She is right when she says make your own. But how can she exclude that tomatoes transform when simmered? That, yes, spaghetti sauce is a crowd pleaser, but not the one made in 10 minutes! So, it made me doubt all the recipes. And recipes are what is in there, with other thoughts ala Cooks magazine. So I give it 3 stars for cleverness and format, but did not buy it because of that HUGE omission, and that I already have a ton of recipes."
5,This is the most useful cook book I have ever purchased,So many ideas!!!!! Great for low carbers like myself...just ignore the starch dishes.I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!
3,Novice Cook Lauds Bookless Cook,"Actually, for one who is a novice, cookingwith knowledge of the building blocks isactually easier than from detailed prescriptions."
1,Why Does This Book Contain Recipes?,"This is a deceitful book. The ""techniques"" mentioned in the title are summarized in tiny -- and dreadful -- ""poems."" And the book contains recipes which the novice cook must read!I have a suspicion that this is a ""vanity press"" book; that is, one which the AUTHOR pays to have published."
4,pam anderson,"i've followed pam anderson in parade when she was a contributor. i've also tried her soup recipe. this book takes care of all the other recipe books i have.item arrived in perfect condition, well packaged, and brand new as claimed. i'm happy with this purchase."
4,There's alwas time to make dinner...,"My dilemma: working parent with a toddler and a husband who occasionally decides to be a vegetarian. This cookbook works for me.It's not fancy food: it's simple, tasty, and easy to prepare. I love to cook, but run short of energy and ideas at the end of a long day. Instead of the more expensive 'solution' of fast food (which is a decision I'm never happy with...), I can have a hot meal on the table - with plenty of options when we go 'meat free' around here. At the end of it all, I feel creative and as though I can still give our family the 'home cooked' meals I grew up with."
5,A Cookbook Worth Reading Cover to Cover,"...and I'm not into reading cookbooks. This one you can curl up with and ENJOY. Lots of great advice. I particularly like the section on basic stock for your pantry. I didn't agree with every item but if you picked your favorites out of it, you could make anything on the spur of the moment."
4,Great book to teach the basics of cooking,"I'll bet most people cook without a cookbook and aren't even aware of what they are doing --improvising on known dishes and techniques. And I learned to cook as a child from my mom, so I've been cooking for decades. But what if you didn't learn to cook and now you have to? This is a great book for learning important basic techniques.I didn't like all of the recipes I saw, but the IDEAS are right. And keeping broth and frozen spinach on hand is a good thing--I always do that myself. Wonton skins are useful as well, but I don't agree with a no-bake lasagna. The blueprint for creating stir-fry is also helpful. If you already know how to cook, you won't need this book. If you are learning how to cook and want to streamline the process, this can help"
2,Techniques every cook probably already knows by heart,I was expecting some great revelations about cooking that I never figured out and my mom never taught me.Unfortunately there is pretty much nothing in here that you should not already know if you have spent a few evenings cooking.I was really hoping to like this book but was so disappointed.
4,seems to keep our Labs coat looking healthy.,"We started using Linatone years ago when our dog suffered allergies in the humid gulf coast climate. It helped with the allergies and has kept our dog's coat looking thick and healthy. She's almost 15 years old and still looks fine, albeit greyer."
5,Linatone Plus for dogs,"I have used this product before on another dog years ago that had skin problems and it worked very well then. When my dog now started to have skin issues I thought I would try it again. It has already helped with his dry skin, and dog odor. I will order it again and continue to use it."
3,not enough detailed instruction for the new beginner,"The lesson average was 45-60 minutes, the information was well presented, but as a brand new user - I needed to be presented with a very basic, detailed lesson from beginning to end. The end of the lesson failed to tell you how to use the knowledge you had just learned."
3,I liked it and you should read it !,PhotoShop 5 in 24 hours and a good book to start out with. It will tech you most of the basic stuff that you need to know.
3,"not bad, but author knowledge limited","Covers the basics of how to use PhotoShop 5. Don't expect any creative advice though, as the author is more of a 'journeyman' type (i.e. writes all types of books). Some of the picture examples are particularily bleak.Sometimes however, she seems to have got the wrong end of the stick ...example: ""Web designers are currently limited to the 216 colors shared by Mac's and PCs.....if you are planning to publish your work on the www, this is the palette <Indexed Color> in which you should do most of your work."" - hopefully anyone who has spend money of PS5 knows this is complete nonsense nowadays where 16 bit color is assumed for webpage design.Overall not a bad book for teaching you how a hammer works, but not for telling you what to do with it."
3,its okay,"1 of the batterys had signs of corrosion,,still works tho.hope it lasts and not corrode the camera internals . ."
1,The writer doesn't know anything about the subject!!!!,The Arabs are Semites. So how can the writer say that the Arabs are anti-Semites.
2,"Pollitz's first novel a nice try, but not a great book.","The book offers some interesting insights into the Wall Street of 1969/70, but the characters are dull, the plot lacking in twists or surprises, and the outcome dissatisfying. There is some gratuitous pornography, too. In every scene the characters are drinking alcohol, and a high percentage of them seem to be alcoholics. Skip this one."
5,From Introduction,"This is the inside story of the beginning of the Charismatic Renewal - Expanded and Updated ""A sense of import begins to dawn on the reader from the opening chapter, as a suburban housewife receives the overwhelming revelation that Jesus died for her, personally. This sense grows as she is then led, step by halting step, into an experience of the Holy Spirit that transforms her life and the lives of countless others into a modern-day continuation of The Acts of the Apostles. In the additional chapter 'Epilogue 1995,' you will find interesting updates on various people in the book - as well as accounts of some key events in the early days which were deliberately left out of previous editions."" ~ Rick Willians"
2,Couldn't Hold My Interest,"This novel could not hold my interest. I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book. I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting. I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her. Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion. Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story. In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series."
4,"Not my favorite, but still Very Good","Conspiracy theories are not my favorite plot device. It is hard for me to identify with the strong feelings expressed by many of the characters in this book, but I do believe people, particularly of the English upper classes, felt them. This is not my favorite Perry, but it is hard to deny that she is a superb writer. Her ability to crease a sense of time and place are unparallel."
3,Disappointing,"Not what I expected from Anne Perry. I love her Monk and Pitt novels and was looking forward to this one. If this had been by ""Jane Doe"" I might have given it 4 stars, but I was really disappointed. When an aothor abandons a teriffic series (i.e., when Patricia Cornwell dropped Kay Scapetta and wrote that HORRIBLE ""Isle of Dogs"" ) readers don't get what they were expecting. Sorry, Anne, go back to the Victorian age."
3,Time period and setting quite good,"I enjoy books in this time period -- had not read any of Anne Perry's Victorian novels.very descriptive of the setting and interiors,which I enjoyed. So many characters and a bit too much introspective pondering. she did seem to drop things in out of the blue -- in spite of this it kept me coming back to finish it. I may try another"
4,Sets rthe scene for the other WW1 novels. Best to read it before them and go in sequence.,Good Anne Perry stuff. Wouldn't really have understood the rest of the series if I hadn't reads this firts. Don't understand why it's not available on Kindle as the others are.
2,"dull, occasionally even silly, poorly edited","What a disappointment. I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series. It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel: despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about."
1,R.I.P.,"I trudged through this dull disappointment in disbelief - is this the same Anne Perry whose William Monk and Thomas Pitt novels delivered finely-drawn characters, incisive social commentary and intricate plots?Here, the characters are cyphers; where personalities exist, they're delivered through overwrought histrionics or dull platitudes. None of Perry's fascinating insight into Victorian mores, gender roles and class issues survives the leap forward into 1914 - in this novel the lower classes are distinguished mostly by their use of ""Oi"" in referring to themselves, and - in the case of the initially intriguing police inspector dispatched to Cambridge University - witless incomprehension regarding the lofty sphere of British acedemia.Perry must have been having a bad day when she wrote this - I couldn't help wondering whether she'd pulled this manuscript out from a pile of early attempts at fiction, perhaps to satisfy a contractual obligation."
1,Muddled Nonsense,"What a huge disappointment! As a fan of the Monk and Pitt series I expected to be introduced to a vibrant new ""cast"" of characters. These are cookie cutters. ""Minister/Teacher"". ""Intelligence Officer."" ""Local Ignorant Policeman"" ""Adulterous Wife"" ""Angry Mother""I had to force myself to plough through it. I kept thinking there would be some MEANING to the mysterious missing document, but it never came. And what exactly was the befuddled Sebastian involved in? I finished the book and asked myself ""what on earth was THAT mess about""?"
1,Tedious Nonsense,"It's difficult to believe that the author who produces the Thomas Pitt series could have written No Graves As Yet. The suspense is supposed to involve a momentous document which can affect the fate of nations about to embark on World War I. A preposterous document of that nature does finally emerge after 300+ pages on which several uninteresting characters engage in a few murders and suicides. Matthew as a British intelligence officer is perhaps the least credible character in this poorly researched story. Periodically a line or two reminds the reader that the nations of Europe are preparing for mass slaughter. Please, Miss Perry, go back to Pitt and Monk."
2,Dull,This was my first (and probably last) Anne Perry novel. Neither the story nor the characters caught me. I forced myself to finish it....
1,Disappointed,"As a long time fan of Anne Perry and an avid World War I buff, I found this book to be tedious and confusing. Many questions were raised and never answered: Who were the two mysterious plotters?What happened to the original document (or the copy if the one hidden was not the original)? What was Sebastians connection with the two plotters? How did the brilliant Irish rebel leader figure into this mix? And on and on. Too many loose threads!"
2,What A Disappointment!,"I had been saving this book for an after-holiday bad-weather reading treat. Big disappointment. After following the Pitts and Monk and Hester through all their wonderful adventures, I found this book to be a big letdown. It was so boring I couldn't even stay with it--didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. It's hard for me to believe that Anne Perry could write such a dull book, bust apparently she has. Every highly moral idea a character has is stated multiple times, barmaids speak like poets, and pages go by without anything happening except the reader being talked to death. I doubt that I'll bother with the next title in the series. Unless a different editor takes over who will cut out all the excess."
2,Bring back Pitt and Monk!,"I truly like Anne Perry's two mystery series, but I am listening to No Graves as Yet on CD; I am on disc 6 and have to stop myself from flinging it across the room. A) Nothing is happening B) It is so overwrought . . . everyone's ""Lips are tight with rage"" or ""Chest is tight with emotion"" . . . yuck. I have yet to like either Matthew or Joseph; they are both annoyingly rigid. Please, Ms. Perry, do NOT write more mysteries with these two cardboard characters."
1,No Graves As Yet,"I enjoy the Pitt and Monk mysteries and looked forward to a new series by Perry. This book disappointed me. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot predictable, the mystery not much of one. Don't bother with this one."
3,Slow start to a WWI series,"This is a lot to like about this book. Perry's prose is often lyrical. The innocence it evokes is made all the more poignant because we know what is about to happen. The mystery of a secret conspiracy at the highest level is interesting and I liked the way real historical events are woven into the storyline.But there is also another mystery revolving around the death of a Cambridge student that isn't nearly as engrossing. Sadly, it takes centre stage and really stalls the book's pacing as the main protagonist emotionally flounders as he tries to come to terms with the situation.Overall, this book is just average. However, it was good enough to make me want to read the next book in the series."
2,Damned with Faint Praise,"Her books on the 19th century were informative, suspenseful, entertaining and well-written. She lost something in translation to the 20th century. The ambigious, wandering philosophical comments may have had a purpose; but she forgot what they were.The plot was capable of much more complexity, even if only in the hands of the principals. The ending was an anticlimax, leaving me glad the book was done. The mysterious characters who appeared twice in the book were unexplained. Why did she waste time with them? Much hand-wringing throughout the book. And the purpose?It's good to have libraries where one may read before buying."
3,expected more,"I'm a big fan of Perry's Monk and Pitt series, so I had high expectations for this first entry in a projected 5 volume series. Unfortunately the principle characters are nowhere near as compelling as William and Hester Monk or Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. The supposedly highly intelligent Reavleys overlook obvious paths of investigation and in general are blind to the emotions that motivate people to act -- until the very end when Joseph Reavley pulls a rabbit out of the hat to explain who killed whom. Furthermore, the conspiracy that sets things in motion remains offstage. The chief conspirator makes a couple of brief appearances that presumably serve to foreshadow his role as the Reavleys' nemesis in the future. But he is such a nonentity here that it's difficult to get excited about future volumes in the series. I'll probably read them -- but I'll also wait for the paperback rather than shelling out for the hardback."
1,No thanks,"I have always enjoyed Anne Perry's books, the Monk series better than the Pitt series. This was despite the sameness in format. I mean that I was thoroughly tired of every story involving a snooty rich family that made the police use the servants' entrance. Did the police of Victorian England simply not investigate crime among the other/lower classes? Or does Anne Perry not know about how ""the other half"" lived? I was completely sick of self-important aristocrats.So I was glad to see that she was beginning a new series. Finally, I thought,a change. Nope, sorry. The same old upper-crust bores. And this time, the book had me yawning and struggling to keep awake. I had to stop and read something else after every chapter.Give this one a pass. You won't be missing anything."
5,One of her best,"I would encourage potential readers to ignore the several negative reviews of this novel that have been posted here.My graduate work was in history and I have at least a passing familiarity with the history of World War One. With No Graves As Yet, Anne Perry has written a wonderfully thoughtful and evocative portrait of England during the summer of 1914, just before the start of the Great War. Her tone and feeling for the time and milieu is absolutley perfect."
1,Disappointed Too!,"I agree with all of the assessments of this book. I finally gave up after a few chapters and ""scanned"" through the rest of the book. Not up to par, Ms. Perry!! Too bad. Keep up the good work on the William Monk novels, but forget about this series. If you want to read about WW1 times, read Charles Todd."
3,Verbose and rather boring,"I struggled through this novel hoping it would improve, and towards the end - it did somewhat, but it still put me to sleep several times! Being the first in a new series by Perry I was prepared to make allowences, but in the end I was disappointed with her new WW1 direction. Perhaps ""Shoulder the Sky"" will be better."
2,Where's the Sequel?,"What a let-down. Like another reviewer, when I finished reading this book, I said ""Huh?"" There are so many loose ends, you have to wonder if there is a sequel. Realizing that the next novel does reintroduce Joseph immediately, I will eat my words if Joseph, in his trench in France, suddenly decides to reflect on his parents' murders, etc. and fills in all the unanswered questions. Actually I had wondered if somehow I had missed something, but now I see from other reviews that, indeed, lots of things were never explained. As a lover of mysteries, (...) leading you along and then stabbing you in the back. Like others, I thought the book bogged down in rambling philosophy, but I kept going, hoping to find solutions.In fairness, there were one or two interesting philosophical comments: Sebastian's belief that it really matters what you leave behind, ""...it's your thanks to the past, your love of the present, and your gift to the future."""
2,"Tedious, cliche-ridden story by an author out of her depth.","The more I read by Anne Perry, the more I realize what a mediocre writer she truly is.I am somewhat of a WW1 buff, so I thought I'd try this book to see what Perry could do with a different time period.From the first chapter, she simply rolls out one plot cliche after another, with overwrought dialog and characters from central casting. The central mystery isn't even that compelling, and there are mysterious characters whose significance is never explained. I realize now that the reason for THAT ploy was to drag out this thin plot into an entire series, which is the literary equivalent of watering down the soup.I will not be returning to this series. If you're looking for some quirky mysteries set in the same general era, try the Charles Todd series about Ian Rutledge. Or read some books that were actually written at the time, rather than Anne Perry's amateurish re-creations."
4,atmospheric & engaging!,"The first novel in a five book series, Anne Perry tells a superb tale of a fabulous time whose edges are fraying as the gloom of war is settling over everyone, & mystery & murder stalk Joseph Reavley's family.Do not expect NO GRAVES AS YET to be like anything else Anne Perry has written -- it is atmospheric & slow (by our fast-forward addictions) & almost perfect."
4,Very good,"I severely pulled the outside ligament in my left knee due to a bad landing practicing a running jumping sidekick. This brace gives pretty good support but doesn't have stability necessary to allow for contuinued practicing when pivoting, or turning.It does provide fantastic support for everyday use and has allowed me to continue to be mobile with light martial arts practice. I would definitely say it's worth the price!"
4,"Accurate fit, good support, good price",I find this reasonably priced brace to be very supportive and comfortable enough to wear during the entire workday. I would recommend this brace to a friend.
2,Batteries are not Pentax.,"The description of the batteries in this listing is vague, and the Pentax part number is used for the batteries but they are not Pentax. The two batteries I received in this outfit are CTA. The CTAs are 1350mAh versus 1620mAh for the Pentax. In other words, the CTAs have a shorter life per charge. You're better off buying the grip and batteries separately.The grip is genuine Pentax and well constructed. I highly recommend it as it makes an excellent camera (K10D) even better."
5,Basic.,A precious aid for art & crafts. I hope to realise a very beautiful works with inspiration of this handbook!
5,Straight and to the point,This book was exactly what I was looking for. It provides a straightforward introduction to colors and how they match and blend. I don't have much background in art and needed something that wasn't overly complicated as an introduction to picking colors for my weaving projects. This was perfect.
4,Healing from the Inside Out,I would recommend this book for anyone looking for answers to health problems other than the usual tread mill of taking drugs that cause side effects that then need to be treated with more drugs.
5,"Ah, the days back when...","Not so much a critique as a personal experience:i saw Crisis on their tour supporting this album. i was demolished. i remember my jaw falling open and staring like an idiot as Karyn took stage and proceeded to rip my brains through the top of my skull. Yes, melodramatic, but i clearly remember this. And i bought the CD at the show and got Karyn to sign it. We talked for a few minutes (with my buddy who knew ahead of time what was in store but let me be surprised) about the music, the artwork, and at the time she was working on a graphic novel (anyone know if it was ever completed/released?). This CD was in heavy rotation for me for a long time. It still gets a well-deserved spin pretty often."
5,Amazing..,"""Deathshead Extermination"" is one of my favorite albums, & was my first taste of Crisis. Karyn's vocals were unlike anything I'd ever heard; so raw, and ravaging, intense, and full of emotion. Crisis is like pure musicial carnage, which ironically leaves me with such a great feeling. If you like this, you should check out their other albums, especially their newest, ""Like Sheep Led To Slaughter""!"
1,Tried two and they both died,I purchased the C9 watch and about 5 weeks later it stopped working. I returned it to the store and they gave me a new one. About a month later it stopped. I put in a new battery that worked for less than 3 weeks.I am now searching for a different brand. Never again.
1,"Bad product, bad service from supplier",C9 Champion Fitness watch was delivered and needed new battery. Stopped working within 2 weeks of delivery. Sent two messages to supplier with no response.
3,Wish it was longer,"I have several of Mari Windsor's work-outs and while I find her voice grating, her jokes irritating an find myself yelling obscenities at her upon every viewing, she's does produce results you just can't argue with. The particular DVD is very beneficial for the thighs and butt although I wish it were a little longer. And perhaps dubbed over vocally with James Earl Jones."
1,Potentially hazardous! Use caution!,"I would have given this book four stars, as most of the information in this book is great.However, not turning composted human waste means that the waste on the edges of the pile never reach sufficient temperatures to kill pathogenic microorganisms. Even if the compost was turned, any speck of material that remains on the outside of the pile (or a pitchfork) will inoculate the material that has already been composted.As a microbiologist, I would only use this compost on a green manure crop, a lawn, or possibly on a crop for animal feed or a fruit tree (as long as you don't plan to pick up drops). I would certainly never use it in a vegetable garden."
3,Don't think it's all going to be perfect though.,"We were so inspired by this book we ripped out both our flush toliets. We started a large composting operation in our back yard. Now we have lots of mice and flies - yes we follow the directions to the letter. He states with proper covering, you won't get flies. Wrong. If you mix food with the foop no mice - wrong again! Mice and flies anyway - so you might want to start small first before you go sell your old porcelain potties. We feel slightly betrayed by this book."
5,Must Read,I found it hard to put this book down because it is both informative and alarming. Another attribute is the thoroughness of the author's research; his notes and bibliography are impressiveThe beauty of his system is its elegant simplicity.
5,WOW!!,"This book combines humor, biology, humor, facts, humor, and specific instructions. Did I mention humor? ;-)It is also incredibly thought-provoking. The author points out that we are one of the few countries that defecate in our drinking water.We now have two composting toilets. The one we spent over a $1000 for before we bought the book and the $50 one we built after we bought the book. Guess which one is easier to deal with?!"
5,Composting Toilet manufacture gives thumbs up!,We have been manufacturing composting toilet systems since 1974 and each year we receive thousands of requests for information on our Rota-Loo system. Many people investigating composting toilets really aren't sure about how they work or what they will need to do make ensure that their system work properly all the time. We also get requests for explanation on why our system is better than everyone elses and its impossible to be objective when confronted with requests like this. We are extremely thankfull to Joe Jenkins for writing such a superb and definative book on the composting of human manure. We recommend this book to everyone and anyone who needs the best information available in order to make their decisions.
1,Insightful and well grounded book,"The author created a masterpiece with this book, combining his vast experience of producing humanure with scientific insight, and great humor which made the book fun to read. I'm convinced that composting manure is the safest way to safely deal with our own excrement. Our society has got to be crazy to be flushing this immensely valuable resource to be dealt with later as it ends up polluting our rivers, oceans, and drinking water. I highly recommend this book to any concious reader who would like to greatly reduce their impact upon this earth."
5,One Great Use for Poop,"I was very excited when I discovered this book, as I had been saving my bowel products for about six months at the time with only a vague understanding that they might someday be put to better use. Unfortunately I live in a small condo, and I don't have a garden, much less a compost heap. So I guess I will have to donate my hard earned sludge to someone who can help it return to nature. I wonder if you ever grow a carrot that has a peanut stuck in it. Also, anyone know a good use for bottled yellow?"
4,the humanure handbook,this book was a great beginner's item.we are in the process of making one as the the instructions were good and the whys and how it works were detailed
5,poopalicious!,the true revolution is in our poop! its a great read and is a vital piece to the new sustainable culture we are growing. thanks joe!
1,Don't bother,"I did not care for this book at all. In many reviews the writer exclaims, ""I could not put it down!"" The opposite holds true for this book. I found I was forcing myself to pick the book back up and ""try again"". The flow of language seemed halting and I found I was re-reading sentences to try and understand the author's meaning. I am an avid reader and unused to having to do this. The characters in the book were difficult to relate to and I felt no desire to ""get to know them better."" The editing of the book was also poorly done. I was fooled by the rating system as I bought the book because of the many ""stars"". In the future, I will be a much wiser shopper."
3,Pretty good recording but..........................,would have liked to hear some songs about sea monsters. The kind that usually show up after finishing your fifth pint of whiskey.
5,The Wise One is Pleased,"oh man! This is such a great little hardcore cd, oh man. I gotta sing praises cause this excites me in a way you will never know. It seems like I'm one of the only people outside of Philly who likes this cd. I gotta say I love Philly/Penn. hardcore, such a great scene man. Knives Out, Shark Attack, I Hate You, Ink and Dagger, McRad, Kid Dynamite (of course)... it just goes on and on. So dig this, hardcore like ma used to make it, short songs sing-a-longs and just melodic as hell, something I wish I could have been a part of. Buy this highly recommended by such an awesome person, me of course."
5,A Classic,"Dr. Pentecost's little book is extraordinary in scope, and yet very readable. I read this book about 20 years ago---at the time it was out of print---and came to the conclusion then (and still believe) that outside the Bible, this is the best book on the Christian faith in print. Dr. Pentecost uses scriptural references for all of his conclusions/recommendations. I have given away over a dozen through the years and frequently return to the worn and tattered pages of my copy.If you only buy one book on Christian faith, this one would be the best.Highly recommended."
3,Much Too Hard to Read Part 2,"I wished I had the other reviewer's comments before I bought the book. It is immensely hard to read. However, Eastlake REALLY made his research. There is almost no personal opinion here; everything is sourced from historical documents or through some clever observations. This early 19C book is of interest to people who are interested in art and the history of art techniques such as how paint was made at a certain period, what varnishes were used, etc. As a painter like myself trying to learn the tricks of great masters, there are however a certain small amount of gem info that you wouldn't be able to get from Art courses today (that is, if you are able to prod along)"
3,Eastlake,"Knowing beforehand that some chapters contains erroneous information about ancient great masters' techniques, is a good book to read on holidays"
3,If You Like This Style,"This is a good album if you like this style of music. Art of Noise is my favorite band, but I do not like this album at all. All the talking and narrating and fast drum machine is not my style or what I liked about the band. The Art of Noise never had to have talking or rambling in past to make their music sound GOOD. Their own creativeness is all it took. I still give it 3 stars because it did take some talent to make this and it is decent for this type of music and it is The Art of Noise which is the only reason I bought this album."
1,Ever heard of Malcolm McLaren?,"What a rip-off of Waltz Darling. Is this all the creativity the Art of Noise had left after the years? I'll remember them for their old work, not for this."
2,"More daft then ""daft""","""The Seduction of Claude Debussy"" is less a collection of songs than a stereo demonstration disc. Themes from Debussy's work are lushly orchestrated by Anne Dudley, but the production is marred by a pretentious voiceover, Malcolm McClaren style ""opera"" house, a by the numbers breakbeat track, and an embarrassingly bad rap where Rakim -- who slings rhymes like Baudelaire, or so he says -- ""gets aerodynamic in the evening air."" Huh? More daft than ""daft""."
3,Overwrought,"Really wanted to like this effort, thought some parts quite beautiful, but on the whole I found the latest from AON ponderous with banal and jarring narration, despite the great Mr. Hurt."
2,"A wonderful idea, a muddled execution.","What a great idea: to mix and meld the undying modernity of Debussy with the pristine melodicism and rhytmn of the groundbreaking Art of Noise. But, my word, what a disappointment! I detected about 45 seconds worth of Debussy samples. Worse, John Hurt's intonations are so ""acterly"" on the first track that it sets a tone of solemnity utterly out of character with Debussy's musical impressionism. The only good that's come of it is that I've found myself drawn back to the glories of The Master...Claude Debussy. 5 stars for inspiration...an overly generous 2 starts for execution."
5,This CD is incredible.,"I've never heard any other work by Art Of Noise, but I can easily say that buying this CD is one of the best ways to spend thirteen bucks that *I* can think of. :) The samples here don't do it justice - this is a beautiful, spectacular album. Ever wanted to explore a dream as it might appear musically? Here's your ticket.""When I snap my fingers... you will be in a different world."""
2,"Adequate, but not essential AON record","One wonders why they really did it. Not a bad AON album overall, but why should every 80s band attempt to make a comeback through rap? True, did not work for Debbie Harry - why should it for AON? If the guys who made In No Sense? Nonsense and In Visisble Silence get rappish, I guess folks like McCoy Tyner and Path Metheney should follow - will be some jazz.If not a diehard AON fan, try to get this one one sale or in a second-hand (""pre-owned""?) CD store."
2,High Hopes.....,"Huge fan of the Art of Noise first album ""Who's Afraid...?"", the ""original"" lineup and all that. Not at all happy with what came next( the novelty covers and duets with Maxx Headroom, Tom Jones, Duane Eddy, et al) after Morley and Horn left. I had very high hopes for this highly hyped ""reunion"" cd, but I'm just not feeling it. The idea is very lazy creatively , rather Malcolm McLaren-ish ( it reminds me of his ""Fans"" album from the mid-eighties )and the execution is not up to par with their work together on ""Who's Afraid...?"" Had this album been approached in a more staightforward way, like the William Orbit collection Pieces in a Modern Style, or even like some of Wendy Carlos' work as an interpreter of classical music using synthetic devices, it might be more inspiring or engaging. But as it is, this is for me a big letdown."
4,Aural ribbon candy with nutrition.,"Crisp, delicious, and informative, this disc will both set you dreaming and shake loose the nuts and bolts of your car. Emphasis on texture, depth, contrast, and erudition."
3,Pretentious,"...was the only word that came to mind when I listened to this album, which I meant in a bad sense. But then again, maybe it isn't all bad. I certainly give them credit for doing something completely unexpected, with completely unexpected guest stars (Donna Lewis and Rakim?). The music is well performed (although what Lol Creme does eludes my ears), and they manage to get through the whole album with a very difficult premise without losing their footing. It's something I probably won't listen to as much their previous work - it's certainly something you have to be in the mood to hear. Proceed cautiously."
4,Sounds like poetry,The music here is actually reminiscent of the albums namesake. Many of the songs have a fluid nature like Debussy's waterworks. The songs are generally calming and the vocals are a nice companion to the music. My only complaint was that the quality of the music was not steady and the weak tracks subtracted from the linear nature of the piece.
5,One of the best albums of all time.,"Sure, I'm biased, having been into AoN since the mid-80s. Sure, I've got the posters, the vinyl 12"" club mixes, the t-shirts, the autographs... maybe that makes me a biased reviewer. But if you are a true fan of music in any genre, this is a MUST-HAVE album. The Art of Noise deftly turns snippets of Debussy themes into mentally absorbant sonic landscapes. Not a single track on the disc is short on painstaking detail and immaculate production. ""The Holy Egoism of Genius"", with it's theatrical presentation and thematic arrangement is, quite possibly, the most ambitious and powerful electronica composition I've ever heard... it is to electronic music what ""A Day In The Life"" (Beatles) is to rock. This CD is an epic masterpiece that should be a part of any serious music lover's collection."
4,"It's Art, and it's Noise. So why not?","This album is a treat. It's a fattening treat. It's a truffle. Trevor Horn + Anne Dudley + Debussy = CONFECTION. Reminds me a lot of Saint Etienne at their most filmic, although I could do without John Hurt's narration, which kind of interrupts the flow for me. The rap contributions are welcome - Art of Noise have always included an element of hip-hop in their music, and Rakim's raps are a welcome updated sound for a 1999 AON album. If you're expecting an album of funky electronica, you aren't going to find ""Kiss"" or ""Paranormia"" (sic). There's some uptempo stuff on the album, but it ain't what this disc's about (although if you hurry, you can get a limited edition with a second CD of remixes). Perfect music to gather wool to, or to go to sleep to, or to, uh...well...no disrespect to Barry White albums or anything, but..."
2,Is it ice cream yet?,"To take up the metaphor suggested below... I wanted chocolate ice cream. I really did. But what Art Of Noise gave me tasted like cocoa, sugar, milk, and eggs enthusiastically but inexpertly thrown together. Chocolate ice cream it is not. For some, the simple novelty of combining disparate elements will suffice. A more discriminating consumer will require a recipe prepared with more expertise. AON have taken a very bold step, though, which will doubtless lead to some wonderful future recordings."
4,An Unexpected pleasure...,"I first heard parts of this cd in a movie theatre without knowing what it was, but recognized the voice of John Hurt. On that very same day i read a review about the album and made the connection because the part I had heard kept going through my mind. Never having heard any previous AON albums I have nothing to compare it to so I can't honestly say if it's good or bad AON. What I do know is that I sat mesmorized on my couch, staring into the liner notes of this cd and lisstened to the disc twice and all I can say is except for the last cut, I really liked the whole concept, content and overall feel of this eclectic work and recommend it to anyoone who listens to music in the same way one reads a book. It requires attention and pays off in a nearly enlightening way, and I'm at a loss to explain why. All I know is that my sleep tonight will be affected, and i look forward to it. Truly strange and beautiful!"
5,"Amazing, like nothing i've ever heard before","This album really surprised me. The incorporation of an orchestra and opera singing with a deep bass and fast rhythms works wonderfully, and you find yourself completely immersed in the music. The brief narrations are interesting and fit very well. Another great thing is it's continuity of the tracklist. There are really no tracks, just one big story of music. I've listened to the entire cd straight through at least 4 times, and I still am enjoying it.What turns some people off to this cd is that it's not what they are expecting. Listen with an open mind, and soon you will be immersed. Five stars all the way, this will be one of my favorites."
3,Not What I Expected,"I usually have loved AON, esp. their ""Ambient Collection"" CD, which is among my favorite discs of all time--10/10. Here's fair warning about this disc: talking interposes the music all through the CD, and you may find, as I did, that this -disrupts- the music rather than accentuating it. I hope my review gives you a little more insight into this CD :)"
5,Amazing!!!!,This DVD is exactly what music fans have been waiting for!!! The sheer power and beauty of his voice just takes my breath away. He is SO good looking to boot!!! His music blends together classical and pop perfectly. If you are a fan of either classical music or popular music buy this DVD today!
4,Its a perfect alternative to the main brands,"I've had 2 other Nikon filters the same type. They are so expensive an hard to find in here, I bought through Amazon from Chile. I received it a week later! That was awesome! Very quick.It's a different material, but it does the job, protects my lens very well.If you are tired of paying high prices for filters, this is a good choice."
3,item looks used,"hi, when i received my item, the edge of the filter has stain on it. I wanted to know if this item is authentic or was it used item( 2nd hand), ?? this is a gift for my friend thank you."
5,"As a protective filter, couldn't be better.","A great, sharp filter for a reasonable price. There's not a whole lot more to say. Does its job, and stays out of my way. I haven't noticed much in terms of UV protection / haze reduction, but for the macro lens that it's on, I wouldn't have much opportunity to see a difference."
5,Good filter.,"Being this is the first lens filter I have ever purchased, I have nothing to compare it too. It seems high quality and that's what I wanted. It needs to protect my Canon 100-400mm L lens and my Canon 24-70mm L lens so the store where I purchases the camera and lenses told me to only buy the very best filters for those lenses. I bought 2 of these filters for those 77mm lenses and one of these filters for a 62 mm Tamron 18-270mm travel lens for the wife's camera."
3,the infamous uv filter,"well it is an excellent lens filter with no effect at all on picture quality and minimal light reflections because of the multicoating .. only cons : packaging was not sealed and filter has dust on it but no scratches , also the 58 filter was packaged in a 77 mm box and imagine the filter hitting the plastic box edge every now and then .. hoya packaging much better and hence the low rating .. bought from adorama photo shop"
2,The UV lense had clearly been used,"When the UV Lens arrived, the seal had been cut on the original package and their were finger prints and smudges on product. Clean up was possible but this was clearly a used item."
5,B+W never disappointing,This UV serves as a lens protector for the great Fuji X100. No distortion noted and does not affect luminosity of the camera.
5,Love it!,"So far this filter is great, I can't really any negative thing about it but it's well worth having it."
5,Solid product qulity!,"I was thinking of getting a UV protection filter after I got my first DSL camera Nikon D90. I did much research on the numerous filters and found that they are sitting from just 5 bucks and even up to 60 bucks. I doubted if this such little thing really dose something with the DLS. Finally I chose B+W for my camera because its amazing reviews made me feel it is worthy for every penny. After I put it on D90, WOOO, I was impressive by its solid appearance.Now, I shoot with my D90 without noticing anything in the front of it. I cannot find any differences."
4,Best available.,B+W makes the best filters out there in my opinion. Back when i was a pixel peeper I tested B+W against Hoya for image degradation and flare with side by side comparisons. B+W always came closest to a bare lens than Hoya in my eyes. I have these filters on all of my L glass. -1 for being outrageously expensive.
1,Does B W clean these at factory or am I getting returned items?,"I have received two of these B W UV filters and one of their polarized filters from amazon and all three are filthy with dust and smudges. Is this normal? Or am I getting returned items? If it is normal one should question B W quality control if they are shipping products this dirty out.Am I being unrealistic to expect them to be clean? Any input would be appreciated.Also, the boxes were sealed with tape on only one side, not both. Again is this normal? Seems useless to seal one side and not the other..."
2,Air bubbles,"I thought this would be a nice product based on the good reviews, I'm traveling in Italy right now and I found there r 3 or 4 small air bubbles on the surface of this filter after one month of use. It has been very carefully used. Don't know why."
4,"Good Product, but got a opened item which is ridiculous !","This is ridiculous. I spend near to 50 bucks for this product and i got a opened box item, probably a used one. Didnt expect something like this frmo Amazon. Im going to contact amazon and check on this !"
2,scratched sides an labels,"Got mine shipped so fast.Thanks Amazon.The product quality is unknown.The filter glass seems to be intact, however scratch marks are definitely visible on the metal ring.part of of logo B+W is scratched.This item must be a refurbished one."
4,Qulity is never for free,"I have been using B&W; filters for over 20 years - so, I can't really compare it with others.I keep on buying B&W; filters because of the quality of material, the absence of glare and the safety that even in a wide angel view, there will be no shade in the edges.Can you get the same quality from a cheaper filter? maybe YES! but I am not going to be the first one that tries it out."
5,Perfectly Clear,"I was amazed when I popped open the box and inspected this UV filter for the first time to see glass that, at least to my eye, was perfectly clear. I had to take a close look at an oblique angle to even see there was any glass there at all. Mounted easily to the stock lens of my Sony Nex-5N. Images reveal bluer skies and even a little more clarity on distant objects outdoors. There is a little extra flaring when shooting something bright such as a lamp, but that is to be expected. I really only wanted something that would provide a physical barrier to protect my lens and have no negative impact on my shots, and this more than does the job."
5,Good quality UV filter,"I bought this filter because I shoot at the beach a lot, and we all know salt spray is not good for cameras. This is much easier to clean than a front element, and is very high quality. Unless you are shooting in a very flare-prone situation, you will see no difference in image quality unless you really pixel peep. The brass threads make this filter much easier to take off than other brands which do not use a brass ring.All in all, a very good product if you need some basic protection for your front element. We aware though, that this will not stop things like flying rocks or a drop. Other than that though, very good value."
5,Works great on my video camcorder,Been using this off and on for at least a year now. I like the MRC and the fact that I can use it on my camcorder. High quality and there is a difference when its not in use. For your investments especially when it comes to expensive equipment find a brand that would produce good results for photo\video.
5,Excellent filter,"B&W filters are always top notch, and this one is no exception. I am very happy with the quality of pictures I get using this filter."
5,best uv filter i have used so far..,"i prefer b&w over hoya, cause it cleans quickly and remain clean for months unlike hoya that i have."
3,Decent protector but expensive,Decent UV protector for my new Canon 5d Mark II. Mainly for lens protection. Don't see any issues with it. But way too expensive for a piece of glass with chemical coating.
2,Good filter. Wrong picture.,"I bought this filter for my chrome Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lens. I am familiar with the very high quality of B+W filters. However, I chose this particular filter to match the color of my lens. I was so disappointed when I received the item! Yes, it's just a matter of aesthetics, but when you pay a premium price, you expect to be completely satisfied!"
5,Superb build quality,"B+W filters are noted for their exceptional build quality and optical performance. Their filters are also thin which makes light pass through easily with little alteration--it's good for wide angle lenses too. With the discount from amazon, who would want to pass?"
5,Good Product,"This is a great filter, a little pricey than others, but you get what you pay for. I would recommend it to my friends anytime."
4,Keeps the dust out,"Quality made, quick receipt from merchant. Haven't noticed too much of a benefit...but I am sure as spring comes and colors are back in bloom, I will."
3,"Nice lens, but thickness causes vignetting",This seems to be a really well-made lens. The only problem is that the ring is so thick that on my camera I get vignetting in the corners of most of my photos. Next time I would definitely choose a lens that's thinner. I'm using a Nikon D200 with a Nikkor 18-200mm lens.
4,A simple filter to protect a lens and to cut down on UV and haze,"The filter does what it advertises. It's saved our camera once by taking the brunt of an impact. The filter shattered and our lens survived thanks to this little beauty. If you're going to spend a lot on a camera lens, then add a filter like this."
5,Great Product,B+W makes great filters. I have them for all of my Nikon lenses. I strongly recommend using these to protect you valuable lenses.
4,Works fin for me,"B+W makes good quality lens filters. I own a Hoya and Tiffen but I'd hve to say construction-wise, this is the best one. Very sturdy. When buying a UV filter, it has to be multi-coated. There's no point purchasing one that less than 2 coats. The only con for this is its not as easy to attach compared to other brands."
5,B+W is the best,I only buy B+W filters and this filter is one of my favorites to protect my favorite glass. You can't go wrong with B+W
1,B+W UV filter,I would have wanted to know if Amazon.com is an authorized B+W dealer. I would have wanted to know if Amazon.com sells grey market merchandise. I would have wanted to know if The filter I purchased is grey market. The filter I received from Amazon is a very different color than my other B+W UV filters. I don't purchase filters from Amazon.com any more. I am looking very carefully into who sells grey market and who doesn't. Jean
2,77mm filter,The package was sealed but upon opening the lens had alot of lint on it as if it was used.
5,Best Protection,"Granted it is just a simple filter but this filter helps protect my very expensive Canon L series glass and because it is multi coated it helps with reflective glare and haze that would otherwise ruin some very special memories. If you are not going to buy this particular filter, definately buy a multi coated filter. Why spend big bucks on quality glass and not take advantage of everything that expensive lens offers by going cheap on its protection, it is a no brainer in my mind."
5,Awesome filter!,"Received this from Adorama (which is an authorized B+W shop). I wanted to see what all the hype was about.. I've been using a Hoya filter on my Tamron 17-50, and was quite satisfied.. Taking the same picture from each of the filters made me realize that the B+W was in fact slightly clearer/sharper when I pixel peeped.. When only the best will do.. :) The other thing I noticed was the B+W filter was also heavier, which was nice. Without a doubt in my mind, I will be ordering B+W MRC #010 UV from now on when I buy new lenses.."
1,Amazon shipped an used item,"I ordered two B+W filters from Amazon. They came in one shipment. Since they were small items, I took them with me for my oversea photography trip.When I opened the items, the 46 mm filter was obviously an used one with the metal rim scratched and discolored. As my return date would be over the deadline for return and I had to use the filters, I simply did not bother to return it. From the previous reviews written by other customers, it seemed that Amazon did ship used items from time to time. I would advise customers to carefully check expensive items they received carefully to avoid getting used items. Amazon should also be more careful checking the items before they ship."
4,"good product, hard to clean","The purchase and delivery process was uneventful. The pictures taken with the filter on look good. However, it is difficult to clean the dust and tiny broken fibers off from the filter as they stuck on the corner. I don't even know where they came from.(probably from the new camera bag?) I had to use a rocky blast to do the job."
5,BW 77mm UV filter,Use B + W on all my lenses. No reason to ever use anything else. Always a reliable product and trusted.
4,Don't be fooled by the picture!,"This filter is crystal clear, has a metal mount and a very precise screw fit. This compares in every way to other filters I own that have cost significantly more."
3,"Product received was NOT ""new"" and unopened","When you purchase a product labeled ""new"", you would expect it to arrive with all factory seals in tact. That was not the case for the filter that was sent to me. The factory seal had been cut open and the plastic container which holds the filter had all sorts of dust inside. The filter was in fact what I had ordered, but required extensive cleaning before even being close to usable."
5,excellent quality,Perfect. What I expected from B + W. Was recommended to me by a professional photographer.
4,German made goodness out front,"I bought this filter to protect the fabulous Fujinon lens on my X100. While I was sold on the idea of getting some basic cover for the front element and cutting visible haze, I was concerned that a cheaper filter would degrade optical performance with flare and non-parallel glass elements. I needed the promise of precision manufacturing, good glass and high performance coatings to feel confident about putting this on a favorite camera. This filter is heavy in the hand and appears really well built. It screws on and off the lens easily with no binding. Images taken before and after the filter show no degradation. Job done - wallet lighter!"
4,Looks Good and Fits My Sony Nex 5N,"Great fit and finish for my Sony Nex 5N. This filter does not get in the way of the lens cap or the operation of the camera.Is this filter better than those costing 1/3 the price. I don't know, but a $30.00 filter on a good camera does not sound like a lot of money to me."
4,Good filter,"Being a B & W filter, this should do a wonderful job. The price was rather reasonable (but still not cheap)compared with top of the line filters."
5,All My Lenses Have These for My Peace of Mind,"I love gear and I love pre-purchase research. However, I don't research lens protection any more. These don't degrade my photos (I'm no pro). And more importantly, knowing it's there means I worry about one less thing when I am shooting / handling my gear. Just got a new lens and ordered this filter without any hesitation."
2,Mine attracted dust - to much static,"Immediately out of the box the lens had a few bits of the styrofoam that it comes shipped in. But for the life of me I couldn't get it clean. The coating literally attracts the dust. I couldn't blow or wipe it clean. It would just move from one section to another like it wouldn't let the dust go. And dust kills a good photo! I also don't know a single professional (I mean the ones who work for National Geographic, SI, etc) who use one to protect their lens."
4,Filter Review,This item was purchased to be given as a gift. From what I was told it works beautifully; from what I read B&W is ranked among the best filter makers so it should be a charm....
3,Professional outdoor photographers rarely use a UV filter,"Folks, I have gotten pretty good in recent years and have moved around in the world of top outdoor photographers. These guys do not use UV filters. Digital cameras are totally unaffected by UV. B+H is really good, but mostly for a polarizer or a neutral density filter. Want to protect your lens? Use your hood or buy one if your lens did not come with a hood. Every layer of glass you put in front of your lens degrades the lens.Check me out. Go to the forums. You will find what I say is true.Ironically, the scummy photo stores will try to sell you a UV filter of a low brand quality. Often they make more on the filter than on the camera."
2,B&W uv filter,"This filter is was no good to me. I shoot with a dslr and uv does not effect it. I thought I would use it to protect my lens but I get glares, specially when shooting around light. With todays cams, this is a complete waste of money.."
2,"BW filter OK, Amazon sucks","just like with movie dvds where reviews are not only about movie itself but about the dvd as product i am rating not as much the B+W filter as what i received from Amazon.The tiny box with filter was freely sliding in much bigger outer box. i think this is unacceptable for optical products. also i found big hair inside the filter under the ring which hints that it may be returned item.The filter itself seems ok, although i was getting some glare on pictures of the lamp despite multicoating and it was worse than without the filter. but i do a lot of travelling and take pictures when sand is flying around or from a car so will need some protection for the lense."
4,A very good read,I found Trading Reality to be very exciting and entertaining - from beginning to end. The plot is great and it's difficult to guess what's going to happen next. You constantly think you've worked it out only to realise that you've been had once again. I found the detailed descriptions of life in The City combined with the interesting world of high technology to be an excellent cocktail. Well written and definitely worth a try...
2,Better than Frey but that's not saying much...,"This is my third try at reading a financial thriller, and so far I'm not impressed. Something about the blandness of the financial world goes badly with conventional, creaky thriller plots maybe. This is less financial than FREE TO TRADE and a lot better than the dreadful efforts of Mr Frey, but it still badly lacks an edge, or a sense of attack. It laps up the world of high finance with breathless enthusiasm (all those HUGE sums of money being moved around - how thrilling! Or is it?). The result is pretty flat and dull."
4,"Less foreseeable than ""Free to Trade"" by Ridpath","The book really keeps you up all night. It has less brokering stuff then ""Free to Trade"" what makes it even more interesting. Ridpath manages to combine the two areas of brokering and virtual reality but keeps it near real life. The classic ending of an english criminal story of gathering all suspects in one room to make the murderer reveale himself, is varied in a fascinating way."
5,I am hooked!,"This is my first Michael Ridpath book and I have become a true fan. I am not much for thrillers but this was different because I believed the characters. They were authentic people with normal interests that were drawn into a mystery, as was I. I hate stories where characters appear only to create the mystery and have no believeable purpose otherwise. I grew to care about each character, to dislike some, and feel a genuin sense of loss when one was killed. I almost hated to go about my life because I would prefer to stay remain absorbed in this world. It ended too soon, and I already miss them.I am now looking through Mr. Ridpath's body of work for a sequal or at least another appearance of Paul, Cathy, and Cash."
3,OK Info-novel Who-dunn-it,"Trading Reality is OK.The story is about a Brit financial-type who takes over his murdered brother's start-up in Scotland's Silicon Glen. He is forced to deal with the conflict of honoring his brother's wishes and his own mercenary instincts.The bond trader turned entrepreneur reminded me of Po Bronson's last two novels merged into a who-dunn-it, but without the humor. Merging the bond trader and high-tech startup entrepreneur together and layering that on top of a mystery was too blatant a play at a info-novel for me. And it was too predictable. Finally, there were some quirky things about the story. No marital relationship of the story's characters past or present either worked-out or was working out. And the final love-interest did not appear to imply any commitment. Hmmm?This book is OK, but there are better things to read."
4,Delicious,"I love this product. It's the perfect proportions of cherries to chocolate. I keep a small container of these at work and it's perfect because when I get a chocolate craving, I can eat just a few and then I'm good. The only thing that would make me love this product more is if it was less expensive so I could buy them regularly instead of being a splurge item or if they were organic (and that would make it more than worth the money)."
5,Like these cherries,Traverse Bay chocolate-covered dried cherries are consistently good. I've never found a package of these cherries that tasted anything other than what I've come to expect. They make a good snack.
